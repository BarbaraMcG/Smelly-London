16 Illegitimate Births.—The following table shows the number of illegitimate births and the percentage of the total births. Stillbirths.—The corrected number of stillbirths during the year was 10 which represents a rate for the Borough of 0.25 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 0.44 for London as a whole. MARRIAGES. There were 839 marriages registered in the Borough during the year (1065 in 1939). The marriage rate (number of marriages per 1,000 of population) was 21.6 In the preceding year the marriage rate was 19.2.. DEATHS. The total number of deaths of Chelsea residents during the year was 851 equivalent to a death rate of 22.0 per 1,000 of estimated estimated civilian population. The death rate for England and Wales for 1940 was 14.3, and for London 17.8. Adjusted Death Rate.—If the populations of all areas were similarly constituted as regards the proportions of their sex and age group com - ponents, their crude death rates (deaths per 1,000 population) could be accepted as valid comparative measures of the mortalities experienced by the several populations. In practice, however, populations are not thus similarly constituted, and the Registrar-General has accordingly calculated a factor (called the Areal Comparability Factor) for each district. This is, in effect, an adjustment of the age and sex composition of the district to that of England and Wales as a whole, so that all may be compared on the same basis. To obtain the adjusted death rate, the crude death rate is multiplied by the Comparative Factor which has the effect of making a corrected death rate comparable with the death rate of any other district which has been similarly adjusted. The Areal Comparative Factor for Chelsea is 0.81. and the death rate for 1940 when set adjusted is 17.8.
