For immunisation of individuals exposed to diphtheria after anti-toxin has been administered. The administration of toxin-anti - toxin should be delayed for at least two weeks after the serum injection. The above description, mainly after Parke, Davis & Co., gives the impression, perhaps, that the actual work is laborious; in actual practice this is not so. Diphtheria will never be got under in London until these steps are taken. In Deptford we supply diphtheria anti-toxin to any practitioner who applies at the Town Hall for it.
