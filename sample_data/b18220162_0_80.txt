73 The Shelter. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 60, Sub-Section 4, imposes on the Sanitary Authority the duty of making provision for the temporary housing of persons who are compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority. The accommodation provided consists of a detached building containing two separate and distinct tenements, each consisting of two bedrooms, kitchen, larder, bathroom, and w.c. The shelter was not used during the year. Disinfection. The disinfection of infected clothing and bedding has been carried out at the Disinfecting Station, Watson Street, by means of two machines of the Washington-Lyons pattern with independent boilers. The number of rooms disinfected by the Council's staff during the year was 1,540. Disinfecting fluid is supplied gratis where required in cases of infectious disease. When necessary, the walls of the disinfected portion of the house have been stripped and the ceilings cleansed.
