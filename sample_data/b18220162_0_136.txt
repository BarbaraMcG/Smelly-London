127 Further Observations on Maternity and Child Welfare. The circular of the Ministry of Health on the Survey Report specifies the subjects upon which information is requested under the above. The work is fully set out in the preceding pages and Tables, but a few words are necessary on certain subjects named. The Midwives Acts, 1902 and 1918. The London County Council is the supervisory authority. In the case of Puerperal Fever enquiry is made locally to see that the midwife concerned has taken the necessary steps concerning disinfection. Co-ordination with the School Medical Service. In all cases where children are examined at the Infants Welfare Centre records are kept on cards of their medical history, treatment, &c. It is very desirable that copies of these records should follow the child on to school life. The clerical work in connection with this step would be considerable, and once provision for the purpose is made, this necessary advance could take place. Enquiry is made into all cases of Puerperal Septicaemia but not into deaths arising through confinements, e.g., difficult labour. Enquiries are made in the case of infant deaths and still-births. Orthopcedic Treatment. In all cases where surgical treatment is required (or seems to be required) for deformities arising congenitally or from tubercle, infantile paralysis, or rickets, steps are taken at once to have the child admitted to hospital, and the cases are followed up at the Infants Welfare Centres, Tuberculosis Clinic, and the homes. Voluntary Societies and Workers. The only voluntary Infant Welfare Centre is that at Hales Street, though here the staff is provided by the Borough Council. In each of the Welfare Centres, voluntary workers give valuable assistance at the weekly sessions.
