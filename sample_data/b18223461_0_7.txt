3 The problem of abating overcrowding is receiving constant consider - ation by the Housing Committee of the Council. I have again to express my appreciation of the work of the staff of the Public Health Department. I should like to thank the members of the Public Health, Maternity, Child Welfare and other Committees for the support and sympathetic consideration which they have extended to me, and for their keen attention to the problems which it has been my duty to lay before them. Copies of this report have been transmitted to the Ministry of Health, the Home Office and the London County Council, in accordance with statutory requirements. I am, Madam Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. h. l. McCarthy, Medical Officer of Health.
