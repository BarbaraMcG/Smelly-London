If there is any evidence of slackness on the mother's part, and if the general circumstances require it, and if the family doctor is agreeable, the case is sent to hospital. Four cases were treated in St. Margaret's Hospital, Kentish Town, two in the Royal Eye Hospital, and four in St. John's Hospital, Lewisham. The treatment which, on enquiry, it was ascertained that family doctors were giving in the home, varied from painting the eyes daily to drops and ointment. In the cases treated at home a nurse from St. John's was visiting from two to four times daily.
