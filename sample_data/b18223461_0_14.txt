12 Physical Features and General Character of the Area.—The Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea, situated near the centre of the Metro - polis, is bounded on the north by the Royal Borough of Kensington, on the west by the Borough of Fulham, on the east by the City of West - minster, and on the south by the River Thames. It is a small compact borough, less than two miles in length, by about three-quarters of a mile in width. Over nearly the whole area the soil consists of gravel and sand, highly permeable to water. In a small portion of the western side of the Borough there is a thin loamy deposit of brick earth resting upon the gravel. There is a narrow strip of alluvial deposit extending along the Embank - ment from Battersea Bridge westwards. The northern portion of the area is largely built over. The central zone comprises a number of pleasant squares occupied by people in affluent circumstances. The grounds of the Royal Hospital, with the River Thames and Battersea Park beyond, render the southern zone unusually open. Social Conditions.—The density of population (number of persons per acre) as shown by the 1931 Census, is 89.4, the corresponding figure for London, as a whole, being 58.7. The density of population of each of the five Wards in the Borough is as follows:—Church Ward, 111.0; Stanley Ward, 123.7; Hans Town Ward, 78.6; Cheyne Ward, 76.4; Royal Hospital Ward, 49.9. Analysis of the 1931 Census figures shows that there is a greater pro - portion of unoccupied and retired persons in Chelsea than in any other Metropolitan borough. There is, however, a considerable "working class" population. Thus, of a total of 19,600 adult males, about 16,750 are occupied. The chief occupations are transport work (2,704), personal service (2,224), metal work (1,036), and clerical work (1,260). Over one half of the 30,800 adult females are occupied. Of these, domestic servants account for 8,746, dressmakers number 1,243, shop assistants 1,090, and clerks 1,471. There are no dangerous or offensive trades carried on in the Borough. There is no evidence that any of the occupations of the inhabitants exerts a deleterious influence on the public health. VITAL STATISTICS.
