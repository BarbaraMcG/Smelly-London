45 TABLE No. 32. Magisterial Proceedings during the Year. Table attached. Shops.— No case requiring special action under the Shops Act, 1934, came to notice during the year. Smoke Abatement.— It is part of the work of a Sanitary Inspector to observe any nuisance arising from smoke. There were 40 actual recorded instances of observations during the year but the chimneys in the Borough have in fact been subject to daily observation by the Inspectors. Seven complaints of smoke nuisance were received during the year and cautionary letters were sent to the offenders. Fouling of Footways by Dogs.— The Borough Council has obtained sanction for a byelaw to deal with this nuisance. This has already been found useful, the condition of footways having improved considerably since the measure came into operation. During the year no prosecutions were taken for infringement of the byelaw. Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919.— A Sanitary Inspector is authorised under this Act to act as Rat Officer in his district. The Act places the responsibility for rat preventive measures upon the occupiers of premises. During the year the Council provided rat-catching varnish to applicants for the destruction of rats and bait traps were prepared and issued. In conjunction with the Works Department, investigation was made of a number of old sewers likely to be infested with rats and a large number of baits were laid. During the year many persons were advised as to the best means of dealing with the rat nuisance so far as it affected their respective premises. Nuisance caused by Pigeons.— The Public Health (London) Act, 193G, enables a Sanitary Authority to take necessary steps to reduce the number of pigeons within its area. Much difficulty has been experienced in carrying out pigeon destruction, owing to the opposition of a large section of the public. During the year pigeons were captured and humanely destroyed.
