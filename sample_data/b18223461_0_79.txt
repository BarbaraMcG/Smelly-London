73 (f.) The number of cases remaining on the Register at the end of the Quarter. (The register of Notifications contains particulars of all persons who have been notified to the Medical Officer of Health as suffering from Tuberculosis. It should be distinguished from the Dispensary Register referred to in Table 52 which contains the names of all persons attending at, or seen in connection with, the Dispensary for diagnosis and treat - ment). Home Visiting.—The duties of Tuberculosis Visitor in the Borough are undertaken by the staff of Brompton Hospital. A grant of £50 per annum is paid by the Borough Council for this service. The Tuberculosis Visitor in the course of the year paid 106 visits to non - dispensary cases of Tuberculosis. Visits made to Dispensary cases of Tuberculosis are recorded in Table No. 52 Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925.— The Regulations provide, inter alia, that no person suffering from respir - atory tuberculosis who is in an infectious condition, shall be engaged in any form of dairy work involving the milking of cows, the treat - ment of milk or the handling of milk containers. Investigations in connection with these Regulations have been made in the Borough but no case calling for action has thus far been discovered. Chelsea Tuberculosis Scheme.—Table No. 52, subjoined, is prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Health. The Table includes:— (a.) Summary of cases dealt with at the Chelsea Tuberculosis Dispensary, Brompton Hospital, and (b.) Special Cases which were accepted for institutional treatment by the London County Council, but which were not dealt with by the Chelsea Tuberculosis Dispensary. Prior to 1929 this Table comprised cases dealt with at the Chelsea Tuberculosis Dispensary only.
