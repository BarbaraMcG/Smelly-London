143 infant welfare centres, ante-natal centres, maternity homes and hospitals. On these should be hung mottoes, diagrams and cartoons. Write to the National League for Health, Maternity and Child Welfare, 4 and 5 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1, the publishers for their rhymed poster series (copyright). Once purchased they are yours for subsequent years. They cost 2s. per set of six, post free, less 25 per cent, discount to affiliated institutions. These mottoes and rhymes deal with every - thing from Diet and Exercise to Dummies and Ventilation. They are all pretty, printed and precise. Signs vary from, say, half-a-foot to 3 ft. by 2 ft. I have used large sheets of brown paper pasted together to form a background on which diagrams are pasted. The Principal features of Health Week are :— 1. The Public Health Department's section of the Health Exhibi - tion, because— (a) Through the channels of the eye and ear it is the effort of the week most calculated to educate and leave its impression on the minds of the people, thereby creating a demand for better things, for a higher standard of communal and personal hygiene. (b) It deals with fundamental health principles which are expounded and driven home again and again during successive demonstrations by trained and experienced professional workers. (c) It deals with subjects which people wish to know and must know. 2. The Elementary School Children's Addresses and Demonstra - tions, because— (a) The young are impressionable and will talk over and think about what they had heard and seen, until next year's exhibition. (6) If you train a child in the way it should go in Hygiene, the root of the matter will never leave him, and in the plentitude of his manhood, he and his fellows will demand and practice a higher standard than that of their forebears. (c) The child is the father of the man in Hygiene as in other things. (d) If you wish to raise your fellows, hand on the torch to youth with its enthusiasm.
