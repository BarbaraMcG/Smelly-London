89 Compared with 1921 and 1922 there is a definite fall in the deaths from Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis. This is general to the whole country and is ascribed to 1. Increased facilities for the institutional treatment of such cases; 2. The efforts to lessen the danger from living tubercle bacilli in milk; and 3. The removal of advanced cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis from the homes. As regards the latter point there is still occasional difficulty in dealing with these cases. The County Council are sometimes unable to provide treatment. A large number of patients refuse to go to the Poor Law Hospitals. Even when sent to County Council Hospitals, advanced cases, seeing other patients around them die, get depressed and return home. This is the case even when the Institution is not solely used for advanced or dying cases, but takes also chronic cases capable of improvement or observation cases, for the chronic cases also get depressed by deaths and dislike staying. Revision of Notification Register. During the year 76 cases of Pulmonary and 16 cases of Non - Pulmonary Tuberculosis were removed from the Register of Notifications either as cases in which the diagnosis was not confirmed or cases which were considered "cured" and not needing further supervision or as having died or left the district. Disinfection was carried out in 311 rooms, and articles of bedding, clothing, &c., were removed for sterilization. Institutional Treatment. 217 cases were recommended to the London County Council for Institutional Treatment. For 7 the Council was unable to provide accommodation, and in the case of 9 the accommodation offered was refused.
