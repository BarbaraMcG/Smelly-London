79 Messrs. Edwards & Sons, Ltd. also were licensed to sell Grade A Pasteurised Milk at the same addresses as above. The actual pasteurisation is not carried out in the Borough in the above cases. (iii) In no instance was an applicant refused a licence under (ii), nor was any licence revoked. Both at a public lecture at the Town Hall and in the Press, your Medical Officer has endeavoured to impress upon the public that they should not buy milk sold loose in cans but insist upon having their milk supplied in bottles. An attempt was made to ascertain the position in the Borough with reference to milk sold in bottles, and a few other points by means of a questionnaire which was sent out to the dairymen. The milk supply in Deptford is provided principally by a few big firms, viz.; Edwards & Sons, Ltd.; The Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society; C. Marlow & Son; Express Dairy Co.; Higgs & Sons, Ltd. The first and last of these are members of the United Dairies. Omitting these big firms (whose views are discussed below), here is a representative table which gives an idea of the progress made in the much to be desired direction of bottled milk.
