34 The arrangements for the supply of milk in the Borough are working satisfactorily. Families in receipt of out-relief do not come under the Council's scheme for the supply of milk to necessitous mothers and children. These cases are dealt with entirely by the Public Assistance Committee, who grant the necessary extra milk on a certificate signed by a Doctor at the Welfare Centre. This scheme obviates the undesirable practice of an individual being granted a somewhat similar form of relief by two different authorities. The supply of milk under the Borough Council Scheme has undoubtedly effected very marked improvement in the general health of both mothers and children.
