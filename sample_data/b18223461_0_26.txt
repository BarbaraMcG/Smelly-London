24 The following table shows the Maternal Mortality in Chelsea during the past two years :— APPARENT EXCESSIVE MORTALITY IN THE BOROUGH. • The Census Returns have consistently shown that there is a con - siderably higher percentage of persons of advanced age living in Chelsea than in any other Metropolitan Borough. The 1931 Census Returns showed that in London generally 7 3 per cent. of the total population were included in the age-group 65 and upwards. In Chelsea, however, no less than 10.2 per cent. of the total population constituted the age - group 65 and upwards. These facts must be borne in mind in any analysis of the Chelsea mortality rate, as they are naturally reflected in the death returns. In 19:40 deaths of pensioners in the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, accounted for 47 deaths, inward transfers included (equivalent to 1.2 of the death rate). For many years past more than half the deaths in Chelsea have occurred in persons over 65 years of age. CAUSES OF SICKNESS IN THE BOROUGH. The Ministry of Health directs that any causes of sickness and invalidity which have been specially noteworthy in the area during the year should be specified. There was no unusual or excessive mortality during the year, nor was the amount of sickness and invalidity,as far as could be ascertained, such as to call for any special comment in this report. No special effects of any particular occupation, prejudically affecting the health of workers therein, have been reported. Deaths from "other violent causes", mainly from enemy auction numbered 209, equivalent to 5.1 of the death rate.
