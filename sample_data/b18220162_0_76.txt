69 CANAL BOATS ACTS. Annual Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1925. To the Medical Officer of Health, Sir, I beg to report for the year ended December 31st, 1925, that for the purpose of Canal Boats inspection, I made 13 visits, on the following dates, viz.:— January 8th, February 3rd, 18th and 27th, March 20th, April 23rd, May 5th, June 10th and 25th, July 7th and 13th, September 2nd and 29th. No boats were found for inspection during the year; there is no doubt that this method of conveying goods has been superseded as far as the portion of the Canal situated in this Borough is concerned. This Council is not a Registration Authority under the above Acts. The arrangements made for the inspection of Canal Boats are : Periodical inspection by Sanitary Inspector duly appointed under the Canal Boats Acts, jointly with other duties as District Sanitary Inspector. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. Hewett, Canal Boat Inspector. January, 1926. UNSOUND FOOD.
