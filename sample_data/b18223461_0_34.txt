32 ANTE-NATAL WORK. Close attention is devoted to the work of ante-natal consultations, as the figures in Table No. 26 demonstrate. Sound advice, based on the most recent scientific investigation, is provided by the Medical Officer of the Ante-natal Clinic. Every effort is being made to ensure that mothers will take full advantage of the excellent arrangements made by the Chelsea Health Society so that as far as possible all risk of disease and accident incidental to childbirth may be removed. Compensation to Midwives.â€”If the Medical Officer at the Ante - natal Clinic finds it necessary to recommend hospital treatment for an expectant mother referred to him by a midwife, and the mother accepts such advice, the Council make a payment of 10/- to the midwife as compensation for loss of the case. No case occurred during the year in which such compensation was necessary.
