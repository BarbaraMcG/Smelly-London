122 making comparison is to take the number of beds. This is a known and stable factor and provides a basis whereby the expenditure of homes can be measured and compared. Comparing the running cost of our Municipal Maternity Home on this basis, with others, our relative position is a very satisfactory one. Before giving the various tables in connection with the Home, one or two scattered items of information fall to be mentioned. In the past a number of items have been reported to the Committee from time to time, such for example as painting woodwork and walls, whitening ceilings, and so on. It was decided in July, 1925, to obviate these occasional requisitions for repairs, furniture, etc., so in future, just before the annual estimates are prepared, the Sub-Committee will meet at the Home to consider any repairs or replacements required during the ensuing year. This policy was followed out in 1925. Ordinary small items, of course, such as " replenishing of babies' clothing," can be presented at the usual fortnightly meeting, in the Requisition Book. As regards the laundry work, while a whole-time employee does such at the Baths, a woman attends daily for three hours at the Home to do minor laundry work. Owing to the increase in the number of cases now admitted to the Home, an extra nurse had to be engaged in October, 1925. The staff therefore consists of matron, sister, 4 nurses, cook and 2 housemaids. The additional nurse occupies a room which was engaged, in Manor Road, the Home accommodotion being fully taken up. The maximum annual capacity of the home is 286, and as this number was being closely approached in 1925, the Committee decided not to accept any out of the Borough applications. More recently, however, it was felt that this point should not be rigidly held to, should the number of local applications admit of the acceptance of outside cases.
