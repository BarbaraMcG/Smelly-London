32 T.A.H., female, age 9 years, had a headache on Sunday, 21st, which cleared off by next day. L.H., male, 8 years, had diarrhoea on the 19th and 20th. A Widal test was negative. E.H., male, 5 years, is usually loose, Widal, negative here. I have explained to the Com - mittee before that a lapse of days has to take place before certain substances in the blood are formed—where infection with a typhoid bacillus has taken place—whereby a positive Widal, that is an agglu - tination can be secured. The health history of the third family was of the first importance, and this should be read carefully. J.T.H., the father left England on 1st March, 1912 and arrived in the Argentine on 23rd March. He worked as a locomotive fireman and driver at Tucamen, 700 miles inland from Buenos Ayres. There were numerous cases of enteric fever there and he contracted the disease and was ill during March, April and May, 1913. He left the Argentine in September, 1915 and enlisted in the Army in England on November, l0th, 1915, leaving for France in February, 1917. He was discharged from the Army in February, 1919, and returned to his home at 79 M.C. Road. His daughter, P.H., contracted enteric fever in 1920. His wife contracted the disease in August, 1923, dying in a few days, the provisional diagnosis being confirmed at a post mortem. It should be particularly noticed that this family moved on 20th September, 1923, to join the other two families at 18 P. Street. The arrival of this family at 18 P. Street and the illness of E.H. on 9th October gave rise to a suspicion that either J.T.H. or his daughter, P.H., or both, were carriers. Enquiry was made as to the sleeping arrangements and these were found to be—First bedroom: E.G.H. and son (the patient), aged 6 years slept in one bed. J.T.H. and son, J.H., 17 years, slept in a second bed. Second bedroom: Miss T.H. (aunt) and P.H., aged 19 years (daughter of J.T.H., who formerly had enteric fever), slept in one bed. Third bedroom: J.H.H. and wife F.H., and daughter, B.H., aged 4 years slept in one bed. Fourth bedroom. In one bed, C.H. (male, aged 13 years), and L.H. (male, aged 8 years). In second bed, T.A.H. (female, aged 9 years) and E.H. (female, aged 5 years). There are two kitchens, one used by J.H.H., his wife and five children. The second kitchen is used by J.H., his son, J.H. (aged 17 years), P.H. (19 years), and E.G.H. and his son, E.H. (the patient) and aunt, T.H. When the child E.H. was taken ill on 9th October, his aunt T.H. stopped sleeping with her neice P.H., and slept with the child E.H.
