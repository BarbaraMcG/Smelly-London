156 consists of 66 members appointed by the County Councils of London, Essex, Herts, Kent, Middlesex and Surrey, and by the Borough Councils and Urban District Councils within the 563 square miles of the statutory area of the Board. The Board were empowered to raise money to compensate the eight companies to be taken over, and were required to promote an act for equalising the charges made by the late companies. The undertakings were transferred to the Board on the 24th June, 1904, and the cost of the transfer in accordance with the decision of the Arbitration Court was £46,939,257, The stamp duty on vesting of the undertakings was perhaps the largest paid and amounted to £"214,707. In accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1902, the Board in 1907 obtained an Act for making uniform charges. The effect of the Act was that 91,684 consumers obtained a reduction of their rates amounting to .£21,712. Since the Board have been in office they have completed a service covered reservoir for filtered water at Honor Oak of over 14 acres, capable of holding upwards of 56 million gallons. In 1913 the Board constructed a reservoir at Chingford which was inaugurated by the King and named the " King George Reservoir," which covers 425 acres, and is capable of holding upwards of 3,073 million gallons. Only last June the King and Queen opened a new reservoir at Littleton near Staines called the " Queen Mary Reservoir," which covers 723 acres and has a capacity of 6,750 million gallons, the largest reservoir of its kind ever constructed. A walk round it would cover four miles. The cost was approximately £"2,000,000. The quantity of water supplied last year was 92,892 million gallons or a daily average of 254.5 million gallons. The population supplied is estimated at over 7,000,000 persons, of which 64 per cent. reside norch of the Thames and 36 per cent. south. The population supplied is equal to that of the Commonwealth of Australia or of Greece or Holland. The average supply per head was last summer over 40 gallons per day. Thus in one way or another every Londoner consumes or uses in a day more than twice his weight of water. It is very difficult to appreciate the magnitude of the quantities quoted, but some idea may be gained by way of comparison. If St. Paul's Churchyard was made into a tank and filled with water to a depth of 20 inches you would only have half-a-million gallons. Again, if Trafalgar Square were made into a tank and filled to the height of
