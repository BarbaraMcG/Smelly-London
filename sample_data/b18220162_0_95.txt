88 In comparing the number of notifications during the 5 years 1921 to 1925, it is seen that there was a definite increase in the years 1923 and 1924. This is probably due to a more complete com - pliance with the Regulations following the issue of the Ministry of Health's Circular to all practitioners drawing attention to the statutory duty of a medical man to notify a case within 48 hours of his first becoming aware of the existence of the disease. In 1924 the number of cases dying unnotified or before receipt of notification was 13. In 1925, the figure was 27. Though these quantities are rather small to draw any definite deductions yet taken with the fact that the number of deaths is the same as for 1924, they may indicate that the drop in notifications for 1925 is due to relaxation again in respect of notifying. There has been a considerable decrease in deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis since 1921. The slight increase in Deaths from Pul - monary Tuberculosis in the years 1922, 1924 and 1925, over the total for 1923, agrees with the increase in the figures for the whole country and is ascribed to so much unemployment causing lack of sufficient nourishment and to overcrowding owing to insufficient housing accommodation. No definite cause of the reduction in 1923 is evident.
