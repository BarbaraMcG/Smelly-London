80 Only two of these are so backward as not to supply bottled milk. The replies of the big firms are interesting:— 1. We sell ordinary milk in bottles at the same charge as for loose milk. Roughly, twenty per cent. of our milk is sold in bottles. A very few bottles of "nursery milk" are sold, and at present no extra charge is made for this. This nursery milk is Grade A milk, bottled at the farm. In my questionnaire the question had been asked, Do you sell any milk under the title or name of "Invalid Milk," "Nursery Milk" or any other such name; if so, what price do you charge for it? What special preparation does it undergo? What is the reason for the higher charge in such? "All our ordinary milk is cleaned, pasteurised by the 'Holding' system, and cooled." "You are of course aware that a great deal of milk is sold in bottles which have been washed in a very crude and haphazard manner. All our bottled milk is bottled at-Farm in clean, dry and sterile bottles. During the process of cleaning, bottles are subjected to a temperature of 350° F." 2. The second firm says their bottled milk is also sold at the same price as loose milk, and states that there is a demand for bottled milk in Brockley, but not down in Deptford. Twenty per cent. of their sale is in bottles. The usual straining, cooling and pasteurising are carried out. 3. As under (2), only that fifty per cent. of sales is bottled. 4. Twenty-five per cent. in bottles. "I find a steady, increasing demand for ordinary milk bottled." 5. "Milk is treated by the retarding system as advocated by the Ministry of Health, but we have no certificate so cannot use the word ' pasteurised.'" It will be seen from the above that we are moving in a more hygienic direction in respect of the public milk supply. (b) Meat. 1. With the exception of two small private slaughterhouses all meat is conveyed into the Borough. Full arrangements have been made for the inspection of meat in these two private places on dressing the meat.
