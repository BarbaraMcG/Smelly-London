43 POOR LAW RELIEF. Hospitals and other forms of Gratuitous Medical Relief. The amount of Poor Law Relief is given herewith in the form of the Guardians' Precepts for the last five years. I am indebted to the Borough Treasurer, Mr. Charles, for his kindness in giving me the figures:— 1921-22 169,698 1922-23 179,830 1923-24 165,393 1924-25 155,200 1925-26 153,297 The extent to which hospitals are used can be roughly estimated by stating the number of deaths of inhabitants which occur in these institutions. Only a small proportion, of course, terminate fatally; consequently, judging from the percentage of deaths which occur in such institutions as compared with the total deaths for the borough it is clear that a very large number of the inhabitants avail themselves of the facilities provided by, not only the Greenwich and Deptford Hospital (Poor Law), but also the London voluntary hospitals. The total deaths for the borough numbered 1399, and of these 723 occurred outside the borough, mostly in hospitals. The Miller Hospital is the local hospital, though it is situated in Greenwich; it is a great boon to our people. Other inhabitants go to Guy's, King's College, St. Thomas' and St. John's Hospital, Lewisham. The latter, like the Greenwich and Deptford Hospital, is highly spoken of by the people (as well, of course, as the other hospitals). The Albury Street Babies' Hospital, situated in Albury Street, is supported by voluntary funds. Dr. Kellett, the visiting physician, died during the year. He was a faithful friend to the poor and he will be missed. The Borough Council paid £50 a year during 1925 for each of eight beds, the cases to be sent in by Dr. Hill or the Medical Officer of Health. The Home has been of great use in the treatment of marasmic or wasting babies and dietetic cases, as well as in sub-acute cases generally. The Home is too small to have a resident physician, which is somewhat of a limitation.
