48 Sanitary Circumstances of the Area. Closet Accommodation. The closet accommodation in Deptford is entirely of the water carriage type. During the year under report 1,141 defects were remedied or improvements effected in water closets as the result of inspections and notices served by the Sanitary Inspectors. Scavenging. House refuse is removed once weekly from all premises in the Borough. During the year 1925, 654 new dustbins were provided by owners as the result of inspections and notices served by the Sanitary Inspectors. A twice-weekly removal of house refuse is desirable in the east end of the Borough and also in the Pomeroy-Besson Street area. A canvas or other covering should be placed on the top of the carts to prevent dust, etc., from being blown off the same. An occasional tendency to overfilling of the carts might be counteracted by providing more of them. Sanitary Staff.

Inspector Shelley died in hospital in the month of December, 1925, several days after an operation. Mr. Shelley had been in the service of the Borough Council for many years, and though far from well in the last few months he held on faithfully to his task. Inspector Snowdon had for some time past been in failing health and felt it incumbent upon himself to retire and enjoy the pension he so richly deserved. Mr. Snowdon combined the dignity of the older days with a firm devotion to duty. His work as Food and Factory Inspector in the Borough was of a high order and he will be missed.

Numerous sanitary improvements and repairs were effected, as shown in the following table:â€”
