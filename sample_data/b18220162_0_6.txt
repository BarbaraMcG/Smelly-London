Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my fifth Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for the year 1925. This report is a Survey report, prepared in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Health as set forth in Circular No. 648, dated December 10th, 1925. In this Survey Report the Ministry request Medical Officers of Health to deal comprehensively with :â€” (a) The measure of progress made in the area during the preceding five years in the improvement of the public health. (b) The extent and the character of the changes made during that period in the public health services of the area. (c) Any further action of importance in the organisation or develop - ment of public health services contemplated by Local Authorities or considered desirable by the Medical Officer of Health. Briefly, it may be said that the five years in question have seen the establishment of the following " measures of progress " and " changes in the public health services of the area." 1. A Municipal Maternity Home, with 12 beds, has been opened. In 1925 the Home was used to the extent of 80 per cent, of its total capacity. 2. Ante-Natal work was established at the Napier Street Centre. From one session per week the work has grown to three sessions. A fourth session has now become imperative.
