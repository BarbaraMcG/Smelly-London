In April, 1934, the Borough Council approved an annual grant of £50 for immunisation against diphtheria and Schick testing to be carried out at the Violet Melchett Infant Welfare Centre for children under 5 years of age on the register of the Centre. Early in 1935, the Borough Council arranged to extend these facilities to children of school age, the Borough Council contributing towards the cost of this service. A weekly clinic has been held during the year. In co-operation with the London County Council, leaflets have been prepared and distributed at the various schools in the Borough. Atten - dances of elementary school children for immunisation against diphtheria at the clinic are allowed to count as attendances at school.
