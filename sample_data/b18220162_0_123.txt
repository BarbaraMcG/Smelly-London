116 MUNICIPAL MATERNITY HOME. A Survey Report affords a useful opportunity for describing the origin and the developing administration as well as the subsequent work of the Maternity Home. In September, 1918, it fell to the lot of Acting Medical Officer, Dr. Macdonald, to draw the attention of the Public Health Committee to the Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, a circular on which had been sent out to Local Authorities by the Local Government Board. It was suggested by Dr. Macdonald, that hospital beds might be provided for the treatment of complicated cases of pregnancy, as such cases were dependant upon the various lying-in homes and Maternity hospitals situated in different parts of London (Poor-law beds excepted.)

Still another building was examined before the Committee finally settled on Waltham House, 52 Wickham Road. The cost of acquiring the premises, Â£1,800, included certain fixtures.
