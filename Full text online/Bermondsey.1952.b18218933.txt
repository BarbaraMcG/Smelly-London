Fines totalling £104 10s. od. were imposed with costs amounting to £39 8s. 6d. Four further summonses were dismissed as the magistrate was not satisfied that the evidence was conclusive. All these prosecutions were for offences occurring in January and early February, and no summonses were taken out after the 20th February, 1952. On the 28th January, 1952, a body of street traders, who had been trading in this area, made application to this Council under Section 16 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1947, for a portion of Railway Approach to be designated for street trading ; after consultation with the Commissioner of Police this application was refused. In May, 1952, the traders appealed to the Secretary of State against this Council's decision not to designate and, as a result of this appeal, a Public Inquiry was conducted by Mr. C. E. Scholefield, Barrister-at-Law, at Bermondsey Town Hall on 8th, 9th, 15th 19th and 22nd September, 1952. After considering Mr. Scholefield's report the Secretary of State, on the 22nd January, 1953, directed the Bermondsey Borough Council to designate under Section 16 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1947, for the sale of fruit and flowers : " That part of the southern side of Railway Approach (South) which lies between a point six feet east of the eastern side of the entrance to the Underground Station and a point in line with the party wall of Nos. 10 and 11 Railway Approach (South)." and a resolution designating, as directed, was passed by this Council on the 25th February, 1953. The part designated provided space for 15 pitches, and licences for these, coming into operation on the 23rd March, 1953, were issued. VI.—FOOD CONTROL.

At a later re-examination it was seen that the consignment had deteriorated considerably and the number of " blown" tins averaged six to seven per case. Two apparently sound tins were incubated at blood temperature and in forty-eight hours these had burst. The whole consignment was considered dangerous for human consumption (apparently through being insufficiently processed at the time of canning) and this was agreed by the importers. The goods were subsequently disposed of for re-processing for animal feeding. UNSOUND FOOD. The general inspection of food in shops and on stalls forms part of the duty of the District Sanitary Inspectors. Food, in the quantities stated, came under the notice of the Inspectors during the year, and being found unfit for human consumption was destroyed or disposed of for purposes other than human food.
