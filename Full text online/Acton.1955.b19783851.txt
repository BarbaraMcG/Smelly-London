ACT 58 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICALS-OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1955 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1955 2 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1955 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. In submitting the Annual Report for 1955 I should like to draw attention to the low death rate of children under one year of age. Seventeen children died giving a mortality rate of 20.0 per 1,000 live births, compared with 24.9 for England and Wales. In 1900 for every 1,000 children born 168 died, and this drop in the death rate over a period of 55 years, although slow, has probably been due to the use of clinics and to health propaganda. With regard to infectious diseases, there were 28 confirmed; cases of poliomyelitis with no deaths. A small outbreak of typhoid fever occurred in eight residents of the Borough and five residents in other Boroughs. One person died. The number of deaths from cancer of the lung or bronchus is still increasing as may be seen from the table below. 3 DEATHS FROM CANCER OF THE LUNG AND BRONCHUS— 1952 to 1955 Year Total 25—45 45—65 65 + Bronchus Lung Bronchus Lung Bronchus Lung M.

Consequently it is not strictly possible to compare the birth and death rates for Acton with those for England and Wales. 12 SECTION B GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA LABORATORY FACILITIES These continue as in previous years. The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service provides a Pathological Service at the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens submitted for examination. Type No. of specimens examined Throat and Nose Swabs 225 Sputum 6 Faeces 264 Hair, Widals, etc 10 Milk 16 Milk Bottles 8 Water 13 Ice-Cream 32 Miscellaneous Foods 5 HOSPITAL PROVISION The Regional Hospital Board of the N.W. Metropolitan Area, which includes Acton, is responsible for hospital treatment of the 13 sick. The most difficult cases for which to obtain treatment are old persons or chronic sick who become acutely ill or who are in the terminal stage of their illness. These types of cases need continuous care and treatment, and it is just these requirements which cannot be met in the home. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Under Section 47 of this Act power is given to the Councils of County Boroughs and County Districts to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for removal and detention, in a suitable hospital or other place, of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions; and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. Application is made to the Court only as a last resort, and in the several cases which came to my notice during the year it was possible, either to persuade the persons concerned to enter a hospital or home voluntarily, or to provide home help, nursing and other local services so that they could remain in their own homes. It is noteworthy that some of the services (e.g., home helping or home nursing) which contribute to enabling the compulsory powers of the Section to be avoided, are available from County Council sources which, happily, are accessible in the same offices. Under Section 50 of this Act the Borough Council arranged for the burial of 6 persons where no other provision was being made. PUBLIC HEALTH LAUNDRY SERVICE The Public Health Act 1936, Section 84, dealing with the cleansing of filthy articles gives power to a Local Authority "to cleanse 14 at the Authority's expense any article which upon a certificate of the Medical Officer of Health or Sanitary Inspector require to be cleansed, in order to prevent injury or danger of injury to the health of any person on the premises". Under this section the Council decided to organise a laundry service to assist incontinent old persons and to relieve their relatives of the burden of washing soiled linen, often with inadequate facilities. Enquiries were made from a number of Local Authorities where schemes were already in operation and the information so obtained was of great assistance in preparing a service. By arrangement with the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee, the soiled articles are sent to Neasden Hospital, where they are washed, dried and ironed at a cost of 4½d. per lb. Collection and delivery are made twice weekly, the transport being provided by the Department's van. The service commenced on 17th November and seven cases were dealt with up to the end of the year. The number of articles laundered was 138. MASS X-RAY The North West Regional Hospital Board Mass X-Ray Unit visited Acton during the year. Surveys were carried out amongst personnel of factories and other establishments and sessions were also arranged for members of the general public. A total of 9,619 persons were X-rayed as compared with 18,229 in the previous survey carried out in 1953. These figures do not necessarily relate to persons residing in Acton, as the facilities were available to all, whether they resided in the Borough or not. 15 SECTION C HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL AMBULANCE FACILITIES The Middlesex County Council is responsible for this service. NURSING IN THE HOME This service is administered locally by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care in Acton during the year was 954 necessitating 31,402 visits. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE During the late Autumn of 1955, the boiler at Palmerston Road Clinic which had already given a great deal of trouble, was declared to be beyond repair. The entire heating system of the Clinic was thus out of commission as, except for one small gas fire, there was no alternative means of providing warmth. Discussions were entered into with the owners of the property, but they were unwilling to commit themselves to the very heavy expediture involved. In view of the relatively short period of the lease it was not thought possible to insist on this, neither was the County Council disposed to accept full responsibility for providing a new boiler to a building with such a comparatively short life, for the Clinic would ultimately be swallowed up in the South Acton Redevelopment Scheme. After very full consideration of the needs of the district, and the facilities available at the nearby Avenue Road Clinic, it was decided to relinquish the County Council's tenancy of the building, and consequently the last clinics were held there in the week ending 3rd December. The Child Welfare and Ante-Natal clinics were transferred to Avenue Road, as was the fortnightly chiropody session. 16 The Palmerston Road premises had been made available to the North Kensington branch of the Family Planning Association and it was found possible to offer alternative accommodation to this body at the Trinity Way Clinic at East Acton. CHILD WELFARE CLINICS The average attendances per session for the six Child Welfare Clinics are given below, last year's figures being shown in brackets. Avenue Road 3 sessions weekly 25.8 (27.3) Trinity Way 2 sessions weekly 36.9 (37.4) Cloister Road 2 sessions weekly 27.0 (27.0) Palmerston Road 2 sessions weekly 28.2 (30.2) Steele Road 2 sessions weekly 28.5 (29.2) Pierrepoint Road 3 sessions weekly 30.8 (32.8) Total number of children who first attended the clinics during the year, and who, on the date of their first attendance were: Under one year of age 779 Between the ages of one and five 64 Total number of children who attended during the year, and who, at the end of the year were:— Under one year of age 703 Over one year 2,140 Total number of attendances at Centres during the year: By children under one year of age 13,779 By children between one and five years 6,785 17 health visiting Number of visits during the year by all Health Visitors working in this area:— To expectant mothers—First visits 297 Total visits 452 To children under one year of age—First visits 859 Total visits 3,991 To children between the age of one and five years—Total visits 5,340 midwifery service Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. Only 12.6% of the total births were home confinements. The bulk of the hospital confinements were accepted at Central Middlesex and Queen Charlotte's Hospitals, the table below giving the distribution:— Central Middlesex Hospital 33.0% Queen Charlotte's Hospital 34.7% Hammersmith Hospital 9.7% Other Hospitals 9.8% Nursing Homes 0.2% Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's midwives attending) 12.6% 18 ANTE-NATAL CLINIC Avenue Road Wednesday afternoon Cloister Road Alternate Friday mornings Palmerston Road Wednesday morning Pierrepoint Road Alternate Thursday mornings Trinity Way Alternate Thursday mornings The following table shows the number of attendances made throughout the year: Number of new cases attending during the year 512 Total number who attended during the year 623 Total number of attendances made 2,209 Average number who attended per session 13.0 POST-NATAL CLINICS There were no specific post-natal clinics as the majority of patients return to hospital for this examination. The domiciliary cases who had been attended by Queen Charlotte's Midwives also attended the post-natal clinic at the hospital. Only six women attended the local ante-natal clinic for their post-natal examination. ANTE-NATAL EXERCISES Avenue Road One session weekly. Pierrepoint Road One session weekly. 78 new patients were taken on during the year and there was a total of 656 attendances, an average of 6.8 per session.

One clinic weekly was held at the Palmerston Road Hall, South Acton, a nominal fee being paid to the County Council for the use of the premises. Two new patients were referred for advice in 1955. HOME HELP SCHEME [ At the end of the year there were 5 full-time Home Helps, and 59 part-time Staff. The following table shows the number of cases actually attended:— Maternity 22 Tuberculosis 17 Chronic Sick 301 Other cases 113 20 SECTION D INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES, SCABIES AND OTHER CONDITIONS DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION Immunisation was carried out along the lines indicated in previous reports, the following routine being practised:— (1) All infant welfare attenders were approached at 6 months. (2) A notice was sent to the parent of each 8 months old child. (3) All children admitted to Day Nurseries were given protection. (4) Health Visitors combed their districts for children who did not attend Welfare Centres, and urged their protection. (5) Head Teachers gave forms of consent to new school entrants. (6) Prior to school medical inspections, questionnaires were sent to each parent asking, inter alia, whether the child had been inoculated. If the answer was in the negative a form of consent was sent to the parent. All immunised cases were followed up and, at the end of three years, each child was offered a boost dose. At the age of 11 years or over, this was preceded by a Schick test. All children under 5 who had not had the disease, were inoculated against Whooping Cough at the same time as they were inoculated against Diphtheria, i.e. they had three doses of protective material at monthly intervals. 21 Owing to the fact that estimates of child population are no longer supplied by the Registrar General, it is not possible to give the proportion of children immunised against Diphtheria, but the actual number at 31st December, is as follows: Children under 5 years of age 2,656 Children 5 to 15 years of age 8,616 The figures of work carried out during 1955 are given below: — DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION, 1955 Total number of under 5s inoculated 461 Total number of over 5s inoculated 28 Boost dose after 3 years 803 Schick Test after 3 years—Negative 254 Positive 3 Primary Schick Test —Negative 12 Positive 2 22 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR (Corrected).

Of the total notification 647 were in respect of measles, compared with only 87 last year. Food Poisoning Thirty seven cases of Food Poisoning were notified none of them being associated with an outbreak. In 4 cases Salmonella TyphiMurium was responsible for the illness, the causitive agent not being discovered in the remainder. Typhoid Fever A small outbreak of Typhoid Fever comprising 13 cases occurred in a Polish community. Eight cases resided in Acton and 5 cases were confirmed in other Boroughs in the Metropolitan area. There was one death; a male aged 24. The infection occurred after a meal prepared for a party at a house in the Borough. The hostess who prepared the meal was found to be a 'carrier' and it was elicited that she had had Typhoid 26 years ago in Poland. Eight of the cases had eaten a meal at the party on the 15th or 16th October and four had eaten meals as boarders on other days. In the remaining case the only contact with the 'carrier' occurred during the passing of money. The first case sickened on the 21st October and the last on the 14th November. No secondary cases came to my notice. One of the cases had no constitutional illness and was considered to be a carrier. He was admitted to hospital after Salmonella Typhi had been isolated from his second specimen. All the strains of Salmonella Typhi isolated were untypeable by the Vi-phage method. Poliomytlitis Twenty eight cases of poliomyelitis were confirmed during the year, 12 of which had some paralysis. Cases of poliomyelitis are notified as "paralytic" when there are, or have been, signs of weakness or paralysis, either permanent or transient. Nine of the paralytic cases and 8 of the non-paralytic occurred in children under 15 years of age. I am pleased to report that there were no deaths from this disease. It is of interest to note that the neighbouring Borough of Willesden had 126 cases of Poliomyelitis, of which only 22 were paralytic, at the same time as Acton's outbreak. 24 TUBERCULOSIS Age Periods NEW CASES DEATHS Respiratory Non-Respiratory Respiratory Non-Respiratory Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female 0 — — — — — — — — — 1 — — — — — — — — — 5 — — — 1 2 — — — — 15 — 5 5 1 1 — — — — 25 — 2 4 — 2 — — — — 35 — 5 1 — — — — — — 45 — 3 3 1 1 2 1 — 1 55 — 3 1 1 1 4 — — — 65 upwards 3 1 — — 2 3 — 21 15 4 7 8 4 — 1 25 STATEMENT OF PARTICULARS APPEARING ON THE REGISTER OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS—1955 Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total (a) Number of cases of tuberculosis on the Register at the commencement of the year 622 males 89 males 426 females 109 females 1,246 (b) Number of cases notified for the first time during the year 21 males 4 males 15 females 7 females 47 (c) Number of cases previously removed from the Register which have been restored thereto during the year — males — males 1 female — females 1 (d) Number of cases added to the Register other than by notification during the year 11 males — males 22 females 2 females 35 (e) Number of cases removed from the Register during the year 39 males 1 male 25 females 7 females 72 (f) Number of cases remaining on the Register at the end of the year 615 males 92 males 439 females 111 females 1,257 SCABIES AND VERMINOUS CONDITIONS As in previous years, cases suffering from the above conditions have been referred to the Kensington Medicinal Baths for cleansing treatment. During the year 11 persons were treated for dirty heads. Seven of these were referred for treatment by the medical staff of factories within the Borough. Nine persons were treated for scabies, and one person for body lice. 26 SECTION E HOUSING I am indebted to the Borough Engineer for the following information showing the progress made since the end of the war. Temporary Prefabricated Dwellings. 208 Occupied 31.12.55 New Permanent Dwellings. (1) Within the Borough: (a) Completed and occupied 31.12.55 930 (b) Contracts let or under construction 31.12.55 83 (c) Schemes in preparation 360 (2) Outside the Borough: Completed and occupied 31.12.55 435 SECTION F SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. Waste of water has been notified to the Metropolitan Water Board on 61 occasions and, in addition to saving a measure of water supply, these notifications have been the means of preventing nuisance from dampness in many cases. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and on submission to bacteriological and chemical examinations have proved satisfactory. In the course of the year a total of 13 samples of water were submitted to the Council's analyst or pathologist for examination as to chemical or bacteriological content. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are connected to the sewerage system which discharges, by an arrangement with the L.C.C., into the London sewers. Stormwater is filtered and emptied into the Thames. 27 PUBLIC CLEANSING The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1955 was 19,486 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 2,225 tons. All was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 2,161 tons of salvage were sold. RODENT CONTROL Test baiting of public sewers and treatment as necessary have been continued in accordance with the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The services of the Council's Rodent Destruction staff have been divided as occasion has demanded between destruction of newly discovered rats and mice by intensive treatment, and the regular visiting, examination and treatment of business premises to prevent infestation. There is no serious infestation of rats or mice in the Borough, and there can be no doubt that this is largely due to the Council's policy and practice of maintenance treatment in business premises, particularly those where food for human consumption is manufactured or stored. Investigation, destruction and maintenance have entailed a total of 4,884 visits by the Rodent Operatives, 2,064 to business premises and 2,820 to dwellings, in addition to inspections by the Sanitary Inspectors as noted elsewhere. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Under the above Act, sixteen premises are registered for the manufacture of articles of upholstery, toys, etc., and two premises were licensed for the storing of rag flock. In the course of inspections it has been noted that rag flock and other filling materials are stored and used so as to be maintained in hygienic condition. COMPLAINTS The number of complaints registered at the counter was 1,583, and by letter 205. INSPECTION OF FACTORIES The number of factories in the Borough is 634 and these have been subject to inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors to ascertain that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and regulations as to sanitary accommodation are complied with. The usual work of inspection of factory canteens has been maintained, and advice given as necessary as to fitness or otherwise of food for human consumption. The home addresses of 62 outworkers engaged in work at home for Factories within and outside the Borough, have been visited to ascertain hygienic conditions and freedom from infectious disease. With regard to sweet-wrapping by outworkers, the difficulty of securing home conditions considered satisfactory by the Sanitary 28 Inspector, together with other circumstances, resulted in a reduction in the number of such outworkers in the Borough, and accordingly a large diminution in the quantity of sweets wrapped in homes.

The difficulties of the department have been accentuated by, the inability to fill three vacancies and by a further reduction in the inspectorial staff as a result of two resignations. 33 SECTION G INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The numbers and types of food premises in the area are noted under Section "F" of the report, as are the numbers of food premises by type registered under Section 14 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1938 and the number of dairies registered under the Milk & Dairies Regulations, 1949. Inspections of registered food premises are carried out from time to time and further action taken as necessary to ensure the premises and method of production being maintained at a satisfactory standard. Members of the Sanitary Inspectors staff from time to time give lectures with film strip displays to stimulate and maintain interest in food hygiene and the general work of the Public Health Department. DISPOSAL OF CONDEMNED FOOD There have been no changes in the methods of disposing of condemned and surrendered food noted in the report. At the large slaughterhouse and bacon factory in the Borough all diseased or unfit carcases, parts of carcases and offal are destroyed under the supervision of the Council's Meat Inspectors in a special plant producing inedible material—bone meal, fertilizer, etc. The rest of the surrendered diseased and unsound food material is disposed of either for animal feeding purposes or by burning in a destructor as appropriate. FOOD INSPECTION Reference to special examinations of consignments of food follow in this section of the report and while details of the quantity condemned are noted, it is not practicable to collate total quantities. The amount of food-stuffs surrendered owing to deterioration or damage is largely related to the extensive work of food manufacture and distribution in the Borough. Much inferior food material is received into the Borough for manufacturing purposes on licence by Port Health Authorities and subject to control by this Local Authority, and the Sanitary Inspectors carry out necessary examinations to ensure that only sound material is used. 34 There are two large wholesale grocery Depots within the Borough, and hence surrenders of canned and packeted goods are made to this Authority; these surrenders constitute the major part of such foodstuff noted. The following list collated for convenience shows some details of the surrendered food-stuffs: Cheese 3,747 lbs. Cream 10 tins Fish, wet 10 stone ,, paste 38,881 tins „ tinned 403 tins ,, shell 3 Flour and Flour Products 97 tins „ 158 pkts. Fruit, tinned 19,153 tins ,, dried 438 lbs. ,, fresh 1,415 banana stems Ham, tinned 370 lbs. Meat: — Fresh 12,990 lbs. „Tinned 1,113 tins Corned beef 161 tins Offal 81 lbs. /„ 42 tins Milk, Condensed 905 tins Pastes, Pickles, etc. 103 jars Poultry: — Chickens 77½ lbs. Turkey 12 lbs. Preserves 728 tins Puddings, sweet and savoury 64 tins Soup, Strained Foods, etc. 1,437 tins Vegetables 2,343 tins Miscellaneous 25 jars 35 FOOD COMPLAINTS There were 27 complaints as to unsound food etc., and in 3 leases the Council instituted legal proceedings. Details are as follows: — Proceedings were instituted against a firm of bakers for selling bread containing glass. On a submission by the defence that there was some doubt as to how the glass came to be in the bread, the case was dismissed but no costs were awarded. Another bakery firm was fined 14 for selling bread containing part of a metal screw. Costs of £4 4s. Od. were awarded to the Council. A dairy firm pleaded guilty to selling dough in an acid and sour condition. A fine of £5 was imposed and costs of £3 3s. 0d. were awarded to the Council. MILK The number of dairies in the Borough has been reduced to two owing to the increasing practice of distributing milk wholesale in bottles from large bottling depots to local depots, for delivery by roundsmen, or over the counter in milk shops. 16 samples of milk were taken throughout the Borough and on submission to the Pathological Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, the results of the bacteriological examinations indicated that generally satisfactory conditions of processing and storage were maintained. The wholesale, pasteurising and bottling centre in Bollo Lane has continued in operation without cause for complaint, and 8 empty bottles taken from the filling lines for examination as to sterility, were found to be sterile. The following licences were granted under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasturised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1953, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954. Dealers' Licences: — Tuberculin Tested Milk 20 Pasteurised Milk 31 Sterilised Milk 28 36 Supplementary Licences: — Tuberculin Tested Milk 12 Pasteurised Milk 13 Sterilised Milk 13 117 ICE-CREAM The number of manufacturers of ice-cream in the Borough is now 6. Each of them is equipped to produce pasteurised ice-cream, and production is in every way in accord with the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1947/1952. There are 129 premises where ice-cream is not manufactured, but where the commodity is sold in the main from pre-packed stocks. During the year 32 samples were taken, 26 of ice-cream manufactured in the Borough, and 6 from shops or itinerant vendors trading in icecream manufactured outside the Borough. The high bacteriological standard reflected in the results of examination of samples of ice-cream, together with inspection of plant and premises, has shown that processing and storage conditions are satisfactory and well maintained. MEAT INSPECTION AT SLAUGHTERHOUSES The amount of meat inspection at the two slaughterhouses in the Borough has grown during the year, and the necessary work of meat inspection was stepped up considerably. Some 150 hours of overtime inspection duty were carried out at the slaughterhouse of T. Wall & Sons Ltd., Atlas Road, the time of this particular duty being reduced during the year as a result of night slaughtering and the introduction of shift work by the inspectors. At Western Abattoir also decontrol made again possible local slaughtering of food animals with resultant overtime in inspection duty of some 165 hours. 37 CARCASES AND OFFAL INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED IN WHOLE OR IN PART Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses 1.

Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk, various 183 44 Arrowroot 3 — Baking Powder 1 — Butter 10 1 Beans in Tomato Sauce 1 — Blackcurrant Syrup 1 — Cakes 15 — Cheese 2 — Coffee 3 — Cooked Meats 11 — Cream 21 — Drugs 20 — Fish Cake 2 — Fish Paste 3 — Glucose Drink 1 — Ice Cream 22 — Jelly 1 — Margarine 6 — Meat Paste 4 — Meat Pie 2 — Minced Meat 19 — Preserves 2 — Sausages and Sausage Meat 19 3 Sweets 3 1 Synthetic Cream 1 — Tea 1 — Vinegar 18 — White Pepper 1 — Wines and Spirits 11 — 387 49 41 Milk "Twenty-nine samples of new milk, procured from one farmer, were found to be deficient in fat. There was no evidence of added water and the fat deficiencies appeared to be due to seasonal conditions over which the farmer had no control. A letter of advice was sent to him. Seven samples—three from each of two farmers and one from another—were all deficient in fat. In two of these cases associated samples were genuine and no further action was taken, and in the third case the deficiencies were so slight that no action was taken. The remaining eight samples, two from each of four farmers, were all deficient in solids-not-fat, although the presence of added water was not confirmed, and the farmers were advised in each case. Butter "This sample, sold in a cafe as 'bread and butter", was found to be bread and margarine. An official caution was issued. Sausages, etc. "Two samples of pork sausages procured from a firm of retail grocers and one sample of sausage meat from a butcher, all contained undeclared preservative. Official cautions were issued. Sweets "This was a sample of 'milk caramels' deficient in milk fat. No decision has yet been made as to what action will be taken in this case. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1926 "212 inspections of shops were undertaken to ensure that the Marking Orders relating to certain imported foodstuffs made under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926 were complied with. 1,104 separate displays of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry, dried fruit, butter and honey were examined. No serious infringements were disclosed and verbal cautions were given in respect of minor infringements not being found so serious as to warrant more stringent action. The Labelling of Food Order, 1953 "This Order requires that in general pre-packed foods shall bear on the label a clear statement of the designation of the food and, in the case of compound foods, the ingredients. It also requires that the name and address of the packer or labeller appears. 42 At 57 premises 230 articles of pre-packed food were examined. No proceedings were taken but in respect of infringements found see paragraph 'False or Misleading Descriptions' below. False or Misleading Descriptions "In addition to the foregoing activities which arise specifically from inspections in your area a considerable amount of work has been done for the benefit of all districts of Middlesex equally in scrutinising advertisements and the labels of pre-packed foods and correcting false or misleading descriptions or errors in statement of composition found therein. Corrective action during the year in question included biscuits, confectionery, spirits, sausages in brine, cereals, fruit squashes, margarine, ginger wine, imitation cream, liver puree, iced lollies, cheese spreads, tinned fruit and vegetables. Special Designated Milk "During the year in question one licence was issued by my Council in respect of the use of the special designation "pasteurised" for milk processed within your Borough. The premises were inspected regularly and compliance with the requirements of the Act or Regulations was maintained. Fifty-seven samples were taken, all of which were correct. Safe Milk "In addition to the foregoing, forty-eight samples of raw milk were procured within the Borough and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli. None was found contaminated". SECTION H DISEASES OF ANIMALS Throughout the year, the Borough remained free from any outbreaks of notifiable disease. SECTION J ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION There has been no major change in the siting or recording of the three deposit gauge and seven lead peroxide stations and analyses have been maintained throughout the year, except for the June deposit figure for Kendal Avenue when the collecting bowl was broken, presumably during building operations on the roof, and 43 for the November sulphur figure for Acacia Road, when the louvred box and padlock were smashed, and the prepared candle stolen, probably by children. This instrument has been moved to a less obvious position on the same site. ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY THE LEAD PEROXIDE METHOD The monthly figures for each station for the years 1954 and 1955 are shown on page 44 and the 1955 figures are illustrated graphically on page 46. The station with the highest monthly figure was Canham Road—7.7—and that with the highest average figure was Bashley Road—8.71. The station with the lowest monthly figure was Canham Road—1.37—and that with the lowest average figure was Acacia Road—2.65. The average of all stations for the year was 3.11 which is a considerable increase over the previous year's result. Over the five years during which readings have been made, until this year, the average amount has risen each time although the size of the increase has been less each year. This point is illustrated graphically by the two diagrams on page 45. It may be of interest to note that this year is the first full year that the new power station in North Acton Road has been in operation. DEPOSIT GAUGES The monthly figures for each station are shown statistically on page 47 and graphically on page 46. The yearly average figure—24.63 tons/sq. mile—has increased by 8% over that of the previous year although the amount of combustible material in the deposit has increased by only a very small amount. Once again the station with the greatest monthly deposit— 43.38 tons/sq. mile—and the greatest average deposit—30.16 tons/sq. mile—was Bashley Road. The Town Hall gauge showed the lowest monthly deposit of 13.65 tons/sq. mile and the lowest average deposit of 21.48 tons/sq. mile.

School Home & School Visits Acton Thur. Avenue Road (two Therapists) Fri. —Avenue Road At the beginning of the year the staff consisted of three Speech Therapists, Miss Sawkins, Miss Ash and Mrs. Cleyndert. Unfortunately, Mrs Cleyndert had to leave the district in June so we were short staffed until September when Miss P. Road was appointed. Revision of Sessions Owing to a fall in numbers, the Cloister Road session had been suspended, the treatment being concentrated at Avenue Road and the one session involved being used by Miss Ash for school visiting. School Visits Eleven departments, mostly Primary, have been visited this year. The Speech Therapists have advised teachers on training many children whose speech was not sufficiently bad to warrant clinical treatment, and others have been referred to the clinics. Attendance Attendance at clinics is good on the whole though there is a considerable falling off in the holiday months. No treatments were given in August, the therapists taking leave at this time, many parents having reported that they would be away. SPECIAL SCHOOL The School for Educationally Sub-normal Children was open for the whole of 1955 and at the end of the year 40 Children were on the roll. During the year 2 new cases were admitted, 52 TUBERCULOSIS SURVEYS All new entrants in Infants' Schools, with the exception of known contacts of tuberculous relatives and children who had already had a primary infection prior to school entry, were tuberculin patch tested. Total number patch tested 787 Total number negative 775 Number not read 4 Total number found to be positive 8 Analysis of the positive cases: Two were found to be suffering from primary infection, previously unknown. One of the cases was recently adopted, in the other case the father was found to be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. This proves again the value of the skin test for tuberculosis in young children. Those found to be suffering from their primary infection can be treated and sometimes the source of infection, frequently in the family circle, can be traced and treatment arranged. In three other cases no contact could be traced. Of the remaining three cases, two were known as family contacts but this fact had not previously been mentioned—the third had been vaccinated with B.C.G. and this too, had not been disclosed. All these children were referred to the chest clinic for further supervision. HEALTH TALKS Several talks to Parents and Teachers were given by the School Medical Officer and lively discussions ensued. The School Medical Officer also gave talks to school leavers in the Secondary Modern Schools on matters of health. 53 VISITS PAID BY SCHOOL NURSES The following is the number of home visits paid by the Nurses during the year. The visits have been divided into school distribution.
