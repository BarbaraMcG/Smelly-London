The latter was very fatal over the ???ole of the Metropolis.

Twenty-eight Pounds has been received from the Coroner for the use of the Court ???om, and Thirty-three Pounds Twelve Shillings has been paid to the Undertaker for ???e removal of bodies upon the Coroner's Order. 14 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. The Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses have been inspected, and I attended at th. Sessions in October; all the applications were granted. The Bakehouses have also been inspected. The mean temperature of the year was 50°7, being 1°4 above the average of the las 43 years. The maximum temperature was 94° 1, which occurred on the 11th of August The minimum was 24°5 on November 25th. The rainfall was 18 inches; being 7 inchces below the average of the last 40 years. The number of hours of bright sunshine was about 100 below the average of the last 7 years. There has been an epidemic of Small Pox in the Metropolis during the last year, but did not reach this Parish until the beginning of November. The Borough Road districts was First attacked, and then it spread to the neighbourhood of Tabard Street. The firs Case that appeared in that part was that of a lad aged 17, who died. The first intimation 1 had of the case was for admission of the body to the Mortuary. In spite of all precautions, such as fumigation, disinfecting, &c , it spread rapidly, which caused much anxiety and a largo amount of extra work for myself and the-Inspectors. itions were made at the Vestry and at my house at all hours of the day; the friend??? being anxious for the patients to be taken to the Hospstal; and they were moved as quickley as possible. In four cases I had to apply to the Magistrate for orders for compulsory removal, but when the ambulances arrived, the parents made no objection and the children were moved. From the beginning of November to the end of March 65 cases were removed to the Asylum by my orders. Independent of these 32 were moved by the Relieving Officers. The number of patients in the Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals, which had preceding weeks from 148 to 1,238, had risen in the second week of June to 1,316. and 354 fresh cases were admitted during the weekof It is worthy of observation that Small Pox in years previous to 1884 had increased at the endof the year at the commencement of cold weather, and decreased as the spring Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1884 — 5 15 ???uned with returning warm weather, so that the experience of 1884-5 has been of an ???ptional character. Small Pox at the present time is as terribly mutilating, and as I a disease among the unvaccinated as formerly, and one shudders at the idea which some day be realised, viz: a repeal of the Vaccination Act. With regard to sanitary ???, it is a never ceasing trouble; nuisances arise, are attended to, and after a short ??? come up again. Over-crowding too is an increasing evil, but what can be done ? turn people out to day to find them overcrowding somewhere else tomorrow; and can be surprised ? How is a poor man with a large family able to pay for such accommo??? as we consider right ? The water supply has been good during the year. I am pleased to see that a Bill is before Parliament, viz: the Water Companies ???ulation of Power) Bill; one of the objects of the said Bill being to place limitations he arbitrary powers possessed by the companies to stop the supply by cutting off the were in the event of non-payment of rates.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Fifteenth Annual Report for Four consideration, and in doing so, I am pleased to inform the Vestry at the arrangement made with the Improved Wood Paving Company per paving and keeping in repair the Carriageway, High Street, will, I ink, be most satisfactory. I am also gratified to learn from a large Number of the residents how satisfied they are with the work being carried out, and the comfort they derive from its being so noiseless. I would like to suggest that similar arrangements were entered into as to living the sides of Roadway, Southwark Bridge Road, Borough Road, and St. George's Road where the tramway is laid. The traffic has much increased, and the cost of making up the road to a level with the paving the Tramway is very great. The Footways, Old Kent Road, part of Southwark Bridge Road, High Street, west side, and Blackfriars Road have been Repaved with Asphalte on the old concrete foundation. Parts of the Footways Lambeth Road and St. George's Road have been repaved with Asphalte, 26 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. leaving the greater portion of the footways, nearest the curb, untouched. Several more years' wear will be obtained from the Asphalte, and the large outlay involved in repaving the whole width of the footway will be avoided. This tatter course I should recommend for adoption in the Borough Road and New Kent Road. An improvement has been made, both in the roadway and footway, Southwark Bridge Road, eastern side, from Lancaster Street to Newington Causeway, by the widening of the roadway by Tramway, and fixing the duplicate curb to footway, and repaving the same with 3 inch York. A similar alteration is required from Lancaster Street to Market Street on the western side of the road. % The Footways, Great Suffolk Street, from Southwark Bridge Road to boundary, and Long Lane, from the Church to boundary, require repaving. The footway on the eastern side of the High Street was repaved by the Vestry's workmen with materials from stock. The Footway, eastern side of Tabard Street has been repaved with 3 inch York. With reference to the lighting of the Parish, I am still of opinion that a considerable saving could be effected by the adoption of the Average Meter System; the Vestry would then pay for the amount of Gas consumed and in case of any deficiency in the lighting, or of a less consumption of gas than the quantity contracted for, the ratepayers would have the benefit. 27 Surveyor's Annual Report THE FOLLOWING WORKS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED IN THE ROADS DEPARTMENT.

SEWERS DEPARTMENT. The whole of the Brick and Pipe Sewers have been flush and cleansed. Since the Water Companies have laid on the constant supply there has been no overflow or waste of Water, which, under the intermittent supply system, was the case, and assisted very much Hushing the Drains and Sewers. Consequently some additional mean must be adopted for flushing. I should recommend the Vestry 1 purchase a Flushing Van, to be used only for flushing and disinfectin purposes; and also to construct flushing chambers at the summits of the pipe sewers that cannot be flushed by means of the brick sewers. The undermentioned Works have also been executed, viz:— Sewers opened, cleansed and repaired 23 New Sewers constructed and lengthened 7 House Drains connected into Sewers 64 House Drains cleared by Flushers 23 New Gullies constructed 5 New Urinal constructed 1 Side Entrances and Manholes constructed 2 Surveyor's Annual Report.

TREES PLANTED ON THE FOOTWAYS, The contract entered into between the Vestry and Mr. Holm with reference to the Trees already planted on the footways, for the maintenance for five years, has been so far satisfactorily carried out. I would suggest that having now gained greater experience as to the proper management of Trees, that the Lambeth Road Westminster Bridge Road and Waterloo Road should be plante with Plane Trees also.
