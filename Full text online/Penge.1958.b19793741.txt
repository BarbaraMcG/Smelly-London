To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, I beg to present my report for the year ending 31st December, 1958, which is compiled in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. 22/58 and Corrigenda thereto of January, 1959. The Vital Statistics for the year call for little comment, the amount of variation being very slight, and the figures themselves compare favourably with the country as a whole. As before, a large proportion of the deaths were among people of 65 years of age and over. It is this section of the population for which so much is being done by various voluntary organisations in the district in the way of meals-on-wheels, clubs and other welfare services. At the same time in this department we too frequently come across, by chance, the lonely and often ill old person who greatly needs help in some way or another. If only we could be notified earlier of these cases I am sure a lot of suffering would be relieved. During the year progress was made with slum clearance, and five areas, comprising 22 houses, were officially represented to the Council and declared clearance areas. When re-building on these sites is completed one hopes that more of the sub-standard houses in Penge will be replaced. The value of immunisation is shown by the fact that for the eleventh consecutive year no case of diphtheria has occurred in the district. During the year, under arrangements made by the County Council, vaccination against poliomyelitis was proceeded with and a large number of children received two doses and some, seven months later, a third. A large number of parents, however, still have not given their children the advantage of this protection in spite of all the publicity it has received and the emphasis laid on the fact that it is quite safe. The year has been a difficult one for the department owing to the vacant position of district public health inspector, and I am grateful to all members of the staff of the department for willingly and cheerfully undertaking a lot of extra work to enable things to run as smoothly as they have done. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (Acres) 770 Population (Census 1931) 27,771 Population (Census 1951) 25,012 Home Population, Mid-year 1958 (estimated by Registrar General) 25,620 Rateable Value, 1st April, 1958 £336,596 Sum represented by Id. rate £1,345 The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey, is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33, this being by far the highest in the County of Kent. This results in there being very few open spaces in the district, the largest one being the grounds of the old Crystal Palace the majority of which are in this area. This density of building has caused a shortage of space for school playing fields for the schools of the district and pupils mainly have to go outside the area for games. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that there were approximately 100 men and 15 women in the Penge area registered as unemployed at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS Live Births 528 Live birthrate per 1,000 population 20.6 Stillbirths 14 Stillbirth rate per 1,000 live and stillbirths 25.8 Total live and and still births 542 Infant deaths 8 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births 15.15 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 legitimate live births 14.2 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 illegitimate live births 29.4 Neo-Natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 15.15 Illegitimate live births per cent of the total live births 6.4% Maternal deaths (including abortion) Nil Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 live and stillbirths Nil Births The live births registered during the year numbered 528 compared with 541 in 1957. This gives a crude live birth rate of 20.6 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 21.1 for 1957. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar General for the purpose of securing comparability between local births is 0.90. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 18.5 compared with 19.0 for 1957. 5 Stillbirths The number of stillbirths registered was 14, equal to a rate of 25.8 of 1,000 total births, compared with 18.1 for 1957. Deaths The deaths registered totalled 308, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 12.0 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 11.1 for 1957. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar General for the purpose of securing comparability between local death rates is 0.98. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 11.7 compared with 11.02 for the year 1957. The Death Rate for England and Wales was 11.7 compared with 11.5 recorded for 1957. Deaths among the inmates of an Institution for elderly men numbered 13. A large proportion of deaths was of elderly people, and of the total deaths 212 or 68.8% were of persons 65 years of age and over compared with 67% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 45.4% of the total deaths compared with 42.8% in 1957. Cancer Deaths from cancer numbered 60 giving a death rate for 1,000 Home Population of 2.34 compared with 1.7 for 1957. The rate for England and Wales was 2.1. Tuberculosis There were no deaths from tuberculosis in Penge. The rate for England and Wales was .01. Maternal Mortality For the second year in succession there were no maternal deaths. The rate for England and Wales was 0.43 compared with 0.47 for 1957. Infantile Mortality The number of deaths under one year was 8, corresponding to a rate of 15.15 for 1,000 births, compared with a rate of 22.1 for 1957. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 22.5. All of these infants died under the age of 4 weeks, and seven of them under one week; two deaths were from congenital malformations. Comparative Vital Statistics The following table shows the comparative figures for 1958: — Rate per 1,000 Home Population Rate per 1,000 total births Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live Births Live Births Still Births Penge Urban District 20.6 25.8 12.0 15.15 England and Wales 16.4 21.6 11.7 22.5 6 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, all the houses in the area being provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Drainage and Sewerage All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. Rivers and Streams There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham, the whole of which is culverted. Closet Accommodation The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. Public Cleansing House refuse is collected throughout the district once every week by the Council's refuse collection service using modern vehicles, and the refuse taken for disposal to the Beckenham destructor. Trade refuse is also dealt with. There are no cesspools in the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The subject is dealt with under the heading of Housing and in the Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector.

NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Under Section 50 of the Act, it is the duty of the local authority to arrange for the burial or cremation of the body of any person who has died in its area if it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have or are being made. During the year three bodies were dealt with by the Council under these provisions. 11 Under Section 47 of this Act it was necessary to apply for a Magistrate's Order for the removal of a woman in need of care to a home. This application was granted. MORTUARY During the year 26 bodies were brought to the Mortuary where post-mortem examinations were conducted by a Home Office pathologist. A refrigerating chamber is installed in the Mortuary. Additional heating facilities were installed in the post-mortem section of the mortuary. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordial support during the year, and also to the staff of the Public Health Department for their ready co-operation at all times.

To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, In presenting the Annual Report of the Public Health Inspectors for the year ended 31st December, 1958, again I have to report that the department was under strength by one inspector throughout the year; this situation happily is no longer the case, since during April, 1959, the vacancy was filled. In spite of the shortage of an inspector it will be seen from the report that much work has been achieved. It was possible to commence house-to-house inspection, which was regularly carried out each year up to the outbreak of the war, and which is most desirable in order to have knowledge of the housing conditions of the district. It will be noted under the heading Rent Act, 1957, that this work has lessened. The object of the Act was to prevent further deterioration in property and enable increased rents to be secured subject to property being kept in a condition of repair. In a measure this object appears to have been achieved, but possibly not to the extent anticipated. Some owners of older property have not taken advantage of the provisions of the Act. The same remarks apply to the tenants who frequently suffer conditions of disrepair, although paying increased rents. It is difficult to ascertain the reason for this; possibly in some areas the inhabitants consider the machinery ponderous-—machinery which requires preparation of schedules of defects and documentation, and beyond their capacity to overcome. It is very significant that most of the applicants for Certificates under the Act have been from what can be termed "middle-class" tenants. I am indebted to the department Staff who have given loyal and efficient service, and particularly to Mr. Bell, my deputy, who has spent many hours after the Town Hall was closed in carrying out work under the Rent Act, 1957, where the necessary inspections could not be made during official hours by reason of the inhabitants of the houses being then at work. During the year 726 complaints (excluding those in connection with rodent infestation) were received, the great majority being concerned with housing defects and nuisances. All complaints were investigated and appropriate action taken where necessary. In addition to verbal intimation of defects in premises, 385 written informal notices and 64 statutory notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1936. 362 Intimation notices and 62 Statutory notices were complied with. The local authority, in default of the owners, carried out works required by two statutory notices under Section 39, Public Health Act, 1936. The Council also did the work required by 27 notices served under Section 24, Public Health Act, 1936, respecting defective public sewers (previously known as combined drains). 15 The amount of work done following action taken by your Inspectors will be seen on reference to the summary of work executed. Every endeavour is made informally to have notices complied with before statutory action is taken. It was found necessary to institute legal proceedings against the owner of one house in order to abate nuisances caused by housing defects, with the following result:— Fined £5 and ordered to pay £1 11s. 6d. costs. In addition to this case, legal proceedings were taken against the occupier of one premises in respect of a nuisance arising from the uncleanly condition. A Nuisance Order was made and the defendant ordered to pay Court costs. A Closing Order was made under Section 18, Housing Act, 1957, respecting one basement flat which could not be made fit for human habitation at a reasonable cost. The drainage systems of 15 premises were relaid or partially relaid and 106 cleared of obstruction or repaired. Disinfestation of 102 rooms found to be verminous was carried out. Four licences to deal in game were issued during the year.

INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The supervision of premises and stalls where foods are prepared, stored or exposed for sale has been regularly carried out, 1,401 visits being made in this connection. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS, 1955 Regular inspections of food premises have been carried out and it was not found necessary to resort to legal action under the Regulations. An increasing number of food shops are fitting refrigerated display cabinets. The practice of exhibiting posters throughout the district stressing cleanliness in food handling was continued during the year. The classification of the various food businesses by type is as follows:— I. (a) Retail food shops (excluding cafes and restaurants and licensed premises) 148 (b) Cafes and restaurants 21 (c) Licensed premises 25 (d) Food manufactories 20 (e) Bakehouses 5 (f) Food stalls 11 18 II.

Included in the total were 33 samples of milk, 19 of drugs and 10 of spirits. All the samples were genuine with the exception of the following: — sample of analysis action taken Herrings in Tomato Sauce Tomato solids 1.4%. The "Tomato Sauce" appears to have been considerably diluted. Enquiries showed the "dilution" to be due to a normal manufacturing process. Strix Tablets Composition reasonably satisfactory; label unsatisfactory. This was a label in temporary use. It has now been withdrawn. Cochineal Not Cochineal, but Amaranth (with subsidiary dies).

Most of the applications for Certificates of Disrepair were received from the tenants of " middle-class " properties. Little use of the provisions of the Act appears to be made by the tenants of the older tenement houses. The following is a summary of applications received under the provisions of the Act and subsequent action arising therefrom:— Certificates of Disrepair applications under the 1957 Act 81 Notices of proposal to issue certificates served 81 Number of Certificates of Disrepair issued 29 Number of copies of undertakings to carry out repairs received 49 Number of Certificates cancelled 17 FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 and 1938 Visits paid to factories totalled 329 and in addition to verbal intimations regarding small defects, 6 written notices were served and complied with. These dealt mainly with insufficient and defective sanitary conveniences and want of cleanliness. Notices were received in respect of 20 Penge residents who were employed in certain trades in their own homes but working for occupiers of factories in other districts. In no case was it found that work was being done in unwholesome premises. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 It was not found possible during the year to take any action regarding carrying out surveys relative to Smokeless Zones. No contraventions of the Act from industrial premises was observed. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Complaints numbering 269 regarding rats and mice were received from all parts of the district and investigated. In several cases it was found that defective drains and sewers were associated with rat infestations and the keeping of animals contributed to the number of rat infestations. When considered necessary the drainage systems of the premises were tested with smoke and colour and any defects found made good. 21 As in previous years, the foul water sewers were treated on two occasions. In April 216 manholes and side entrances were baited and takes recorded in 115. The figures for the October treatment were 331 manholes baited and takes recorded in 91. One full-time rodent operative is employed and the following is a summary of the work carried out by him at premises in the district:— Inspections and re-inspections made 2,355 Premises treated for rats 309 Premises where rat poison baits taken 123 Premises re-treated for rats 232 Estimated number of rats poisoned 686 Premises treated for mice 123 Premises re-treated for mice 78 It was necessary to treat some premises on three or more occasions. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 The object of the Act is to secure the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined. Three premises are registered in connection therewith. Samples of materials used at each of the registered premises were obtained and the prescribed Analyst under the Act reported the tests showed two samples to be satisfactory, and complied with the requirements of the regulations. The third sample failed to comply with the requirements relating to soluble impurities. A follow-up sample from this source was reported as satisfactory. MOVABLE DWELLINGS The camping and caravan site of nearly three acres in the Crystal Palace Grounds, established in 1951, continues to be occupied. Suites of water-closets and lavatory basins and hot and cold shower baths are provided in a brick building on the site and there are suitable arrangements for the collection and disposal of refuse. Periodic inspections were made of the camp and it was found on all visits to be satisfactory. A licence was granted in respect of one movable dwelling on a building site. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act came into force on 1st April, 1952, and regulates the sale of pet animals. Licences were granted to four applicants, subject to conditions laid down by the Council, these conditions being based on those recommended by the R.S.P.C.A. One licensed premises, however, was not considered satisfactory. During the year the Council appointed a Veterinary Surgeon under the provisions of the Act, who submitted an unfavourable report on this licensed premises. As a result the application for re-licensing during the year 1959 was withdrawn. 22 SHOPS ACT, 1950 YOUNG PERSONS (EMPLOYMENT) ACT, 1938 Number of visits 327 Number of Sunday patrols carried out 26 Number of evening patrols carried out 41 Number of premises where young persons employed 18 Number of " Mixed " shops where posters relating to Early Closing Day and Sunday trading not exhibited 5 Letters of warning were sent with reference to contravention of the Act relative to the non-exhibition of forms in " mixed" shops when open for Sunday trading, and on the afternoon of the early closing day.
