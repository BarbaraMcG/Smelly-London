Fourteenth Annual Report OF THE VESTRY OF THE PAEISH OF ST. GILES, CAMBERWELL. In conformity with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Yestry of the said Parish submit to the Parishioners a statement of their proceedings in the execution of the various powers vested in them, and an Account of their Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 25th March, 1870. 1869-70. Antral purposes Committee's REPORT. St. Files, Camberwell. The GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE beg to Report to the Vestry on the following matters, for publication in the annual report, 1869-70. NEW ROADS. The following is a list of " New," Roads which have been paved and taken under the control of the Vestry under the power of the 105th clause of the Metropolitan Local Management Act, 18 & 191 Vic., cap. 120. Length in yards. St. George's Street, Commercial Eoad, Peckham 155 Edward Street, Sumner Road 87 George Street, Sumner Road 70 Shard Road, Meeting House Lane, Peckham 183 Glo'ster Place, Neate Street, (part of) 76 John Street, Neate Street 261 Charles Street, Melon Ground, Peckham (part of) 119 Scarsdale Road, Neate Street 189 6 The above-named roads were reported in last year's Report as being in progress; tliey are now completed. Also, in that Report it was stated that a number of other roads were under survey, in order to proceed with the repairs as soon as possible. The following (the works of which are now in hand) form a portion of the list above referred to, viz. :— Gordon Road, Peckham. Albert Road, Peckham. Sturdy Road, Peckham. Brayard's Road, Peckham (part of). Glengall Road, Kent Road. In addition to the above, contracts have been entered into for the repair of— Ann Street, Xeate Street, and Carlton Road, Asylum Road. And, with a view to continue this desirable work, the Vestry has ordered surveys and other preliminary proceedings to be taken in respect of the following roads:— North Street, Commercial Road (part of) Russell Road, Peckham. Carlton Grove, Queen's Road, Peckham (part of)- 7 WORKS OF KERBING AND PAVING. The attention of your Committee lias been anxiously directed to the necessary work of Paving the Footways of at least the most important thoroughfares in this Parish. As they believe the time has now arrived when the benefit of improved Footways should be much extended, they have seriously taken this subject into consideration, especially as to the best method of executing these repairs, also the most economical manner of raising the requisite funds for the same, and they have prepared a scheme which will, they hope, accomplish this work in a desirable manner, satisfactory to the Vestry and the Parishioners at large. ROAD WATERING. Your Committee have much pleasure in referring to their efforts of last year in respect to the Sinking of Wells for the above purpose; those "Wells referred to in the last Annual Eeport having proved successful, it was deemed advisable to extend this work, and the result of a further expenditure this year of about £400 has realized the 8 fact of fourteen additional Wells being sunlc, thereby providing the means of watering upwards of ten miles of additional roads and streets beyond that of the preceeding year, and that at a cost within the previous year's expenditure. The Vestry has ordered the Surveyor's Report on this subject to be printed in detail for the information of the Ratepayers. The length of Road and Streets now watered is about forty miles; the total length of roads being forty-five miles. ROAD REPAIRS, AND MATERIALS. % Your Committee last year expressed a hope that the decrease in the expenditure of material would be continued, which has been the result, and they further have to state that the contracts for all materials and labor have been taken at a lower rate than previously, which will have the effect of decreasing the expenditure in the ensuing year, and will also enable the Committee to execute works of repairs and improvement at less cost than heretofore. 9 IMPROVEMENTS. Your Committee now can congratulate the Parishioners upon the completion of the re-construction of Taylor's Bridge, this work no doubt has appeared to the public to have been long in hand, which resulted from causes over which the Vestry had no control, further than to sacrifice time, rather than submit to exorbitant claims for compensation, which have now been satisfactorily arranged by Mr. Pownall, the Arbitrator, who reduced the principal claim from £1,500 to £290. The attention of your Committee is now by reference from the Vestry directed to another Bridge improvement, viz., that over the Canal, at the Commercial Road, called the Globe Bridge, this is a structure requiring in the interests of the public to be rebuilt at once, as the present one is totally inadequate to the requirements of the greatly increasing traffic of the neighbourhood. TRAMWAYS. The powers obtained last year for the construction of Tramways along the Camberwell New Road, Camberwell Green, and Peckham, towards New 10 Cross Road, liave been suspended from being carried into operation, through the Tramways Company desiring to make a double line along these thoroughfares, (except that of the Camberwell New Road,) in lieu of sidings and crossings, as previously provided for, these alterations were approved by the Vestry, and no doubt this proposition will receive the sanction of the Legislature, and will also lead to the speedy execution of the works. Great care has been devoted in the passing of these bills through Parliament, in order that the necessities of the public traffic and the adjacent property might be thoroughly cared for. Powers have also been sought in the present session for additional lines from Camberwell Green, along the High Road towards London, also along the Old Kent Road from London towards New Cross, to join the line at New Cross Road with that passing along the Peckham Road, as above mentioned. RE-NAMING AND RE-NUMBERING STREETS. The following is a List of Streets, which, under the order of tlie Metropolitan Board of Works have been re-numbered, and in some instances 11 re-named, in order to get rid of the supplementary names of such streets. LIST AS ABOVE REFERRED TO. Albert Grove. Choumert Road; also re-named—previously called Montpellier Road. Decrespigny Park Road. Denmark Street. Denmark Road. Wyndham Road. Beckett Street; also re-named—previously known as Thomas Street. Crescent, Southampton Street. St. George's Road. East Surrey Grove. Sumner Road; also re-named—previously known as Willow Brook Road, Crab Tree Shot Road, and Charles Street. Chumleigli Street; also re-named — previously known as Glo'ster Place, Albany Road. .Tardin Street; also re-named—previously known as John Street, Albany Road. Cunard Street; also re-named—previously known as Charles Street, Albany Road. Marlboro' Road, Old Kent Road. Trafalgar Road, Old Kent Road. Charlotte Street, Old Kent Road. Requisitions from this Yestry for a continuation of this much desired and improved system of renumbering, &c., to other roads and streets, in this Parish have been sent to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the like purpose. 12 LINES OF BUILDINGS, FRONTAGES, NEW STREETS, PROJECTIONS, &c., &c. The strictest attention of your Committee has been paid to the above matters. No less than 66 cases referred to them from the Metropolitan Board of Works having been reported upon to the Vestry. LIGHTING. The extension of Street Lighting during the past fear has been as follows:— New Lamps. Removals. Total No. of Lamps. South Metropolitan Gas Company 62 31 1575 Phoenix Ga3 Company 3 __ 91 Crystal Palace Gas Company 4 — 81 69 31 1747 The Committee in calling attention to the increased Lighting of the Parish, are pleased to Report that there is no necessity for any additional charge upon the Lighting Bate consequent thereon. 1870.

This well was excavated to 16ft. through loam, sand, and line gravel, at which level water appeared. Suddenly a cleaner description of sand was pierced, when the water rose from 16ft. to 12ft. below the surface. The yield of water was steady, but not abundant. The excavation was continued through sand to 20ffc., then 3ft. deeper, through flint and soft broken chalk, making a total depth of 23ft., giving a reservoir of lift, of standing water. This will be ample for the locality. Well.—Section shewing Strata, §-c. at St. James Road, Old Kent Road. Ordnance Datum. Depth Feet. Description of Strata. REMARKS. + 6.00 0 Surface.

Water level (in sand and gravel) 12ft. Gin. deep. Yield steady, although not abundant, possibly through its proximity to the Metropolitan Main Sewer. At 21ft. a sharp run of water broke through the strata, which proved to be the level of the clay bed immediately beneath this ; a dirty sand and clay lies below. The excavation was continued to 23ft., giving a reservoir of 10ft. 6in., which, no doubt, will be found sufficient. Well.—Section shewing Strata, fyc., at Albany Road, near Albany Street.

The position of this well as regards its water supply was doubtful in my mind, however the result has justified the trial. The water level was reached at 18ft. from the surface, the excavation then being in a rough gravel; but, as I expected, it was but the cropping out, or completion of this gravel bed. Below this a peculiar silty bright green sand was found, which continued giving a fair supply of water to the depth of 26ft. 6in., the full depth of the well. The standing water therefore is 8ft. tjin.,and will, no doubt, give a fair supply. The result of this well proves the undesirability of sinking wells south of this locality.

The excavation was continued through similar strata, with no appreciable addition of water, which however boiled up in places, and great care was necessary in securing the timber and kirb from buckling; continued to 23ft. 6in. with like results. Further excavation would probably have produced danger to the adjacent sewer and roadway. The strata, being pierced to the depth of 20ft. 6in., proved of a similar nature. This well was then filled in, and the work .abandoned. Well.—Section shewing Strata, fyc., Parle Road, near Meetincj-house Lane. Ordnance Datum. Depth Feet. Description of Strata.

Being of large capacity, a new main kerb was sunk, and the new brickwork brought up to the dome. The strata here is a mixed native clay, down to about lift, or 12ft. then silty sand. Water showed at 16ft. below surface ; supply moderate ; excavation continued to 26ft. 6in. in similar description of soil. Reservoir 10ft. 6in.

There was a very fair supply of water when pumped out, and no doubt need be entertained that this will be a very useful well. Surface Value, Ordnance datum + 11.00.

This well is also a success. The excavation for several feet below the surface was through a brightcoloured unpromising gravel, but at a depth of 17ft. 3in this strata changed to a coarse river ballast and sand; well charged with water, which continued to the termination of the excavation, at a total depth of 26ft., giving a reservoir of 8ft. 9in.. No doubt this, the last on the list of wells ordered by the Vestry, will be one of the most successful in its supply. Well.—Section shelving Strata, &c., at Hill Street, opposite Langdale Arms.

Out of the 14 wells ordered, but one has failed. The 13 completed, as before stated, will, I believe, fully answer for the work of road watering; and now that the Vestry has determined upon a considerable addition to the roads to be watered, there will be the means of saving a large expenditure which must otherwise have been incurred, had the water been procured from the Company's services. I think it due to the contractor for these worksr Mr. B arris, to report my approbation of the workmanlike and satisfactory manner in which they have been carried out. The new pumps to each of the aforesaid 13 Wells have been fixed by Messrs. Shand and MASON under their contract. It has been usual to lock the handles of the road pumps when not in use, in order that they should not be wantonly interfered with, and also to prevent annoyance to the inhabitants living in the several localities of these pumps; but as it has been urged that they might and should be made auxiliaries of the drinking fountain appliances, I desire to take the opinion of the Vestry thereon. Should the Vestry order that they be kept available for the public use, it will be necessary that a convenient ladle with chain be appended; but I think, as a matter of precaution, that the water of each we'll should be first submitted to analysis by your Medical Officer. J. C. REYNOLDS, April 4, 1870. Surveyor. 1869-70. Sewers & Sanitary Committee's REPORT. REPORT OF THE SEWERS & SANITARY COMMITTEE. The Sewers Committee Leg to Report as follows:— The Main Sewers of the Parish having been, completed, the attention of your Committee has been specially directed during the past year to the work of House Drainage, especially the general Sanitary condition of the lower class property. Reference to the Table shewing the number of houses inspected and Drained, and the further information on this head of the Sanitary Department contained in the Medical Officers report, will supply abundant information on this point. 34 NEW SEWERS Have been laid down under the direction, and at the cost of the Vestry at the following places, viz:— Crystal Palace Road, Goose Green. Pecklsam Bye, West side from the White Horse, P.H. to the entrance to Troy Town. Druid's Place, Peckham Rye. Lordship Lane, near to Rose Bank. Pitt Street and Nelson Street, Wyndham Road, (these were laid by the Lambeth Vestry), at the joint expense of the two Parishes. The total length of Sewers comprised in the above, is as follows:— PIPE SEWEPS. Total 4,290 feet. Number 54 New Gullies hare been constructed. 35 PRIVATE SEWERS. The arrangement for, and construction of Sewers to he laid by, and at the cost of private owners, (a part of the Sanitary duty of the Vestry,) continues to receive the consideration of your Committee. The Plans and Sections of the proposed works are first laid before them, and then submitted to the Vestry, and they subsequently receive the final sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, previous to their execution. The works are then supervised by the officers of the Vestry. The following have been so inspected during the past year. Dragon Road. Belvoir Street. Overhill Road. Burchell Road. Bidwell Street. Upland Road. Barry Road. Etherow Road. 36 METROPOLITAN MAIN SEWERS. The Metropolitan Board of Works has during the last year, re-constructed the Sewers in MeetingHouse Lane, from the Asylum Road, to Peckham High Street, thence along High Street to opposite Rye Lane,—this work lias produced an improved gradient and outfall for the local Sewers. On the completion of these works, advantage was taken by the Yestry to cast and cleanse the line of Sewer in continuation of the last named, from Rye Lane to Camberwell Green, removing the deposit which had accumulated therein, and which previously had to be removed from time to time at great expense. With the improvement in the levels above referred to, this will be unnecessary in future. CASTING AND CLEANSING SEWERS. The ordinary work of casting and cleansing the Local Sewers of this parish has been performed by the workmen in the Vestry's employ, the state of which sewers may be reported upon as satisfactory, both as to their Sanitary condition and repair; the cleansing of the Gullies also, of the 37 roads of the entire parish, being under the same control has received necessary attention. HOUSE DRAINAGE. The following is a list of houses connected with the Main and Local Sewers of the Parish during the past year, as before referred to:— No of Houses permanently Drained. No. of Houses temporarily Drained. 1,186 2 Total No. of Houses Drained, 1,188. 1869-70. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT BY J. S. BRI.STOWE, M.D., LOND., Fellow of the Royfil College of Physician?, Physician to St. Thoipas's Hospital Gentlemen, According to the Registrar-General's returns, the mortality of London for the year 1869 was unusually heavy. The deaths were 77,933; which number, estimating the population at 3,170,754, yields a mortality of 2.466 per cent. The mortuary rates for London for the years 18(35, 1866, 1867, and 1868, were respectively 2 316, 2.411, 2.204, and 2.291. The chief causes of this increase appear to have been Scarlet Fever, Hooping Cough, and Diarrhœa; of which the first caused 5,803 deaths, the second 3,755, and the last 3,400. Collectively they account for 12,958 deaths. The mortality of London is made up of the mortalities of the five groups of districts into which it is divided; and the mortuary rates of these differed alike from that of London 42 and from those of each other. Thus, while the mortuary rate of London was 2.466, that of the Western Districts was 2.263, that of the Northern Districts 2.371, that of the Central Districts 2.569, that of the Eastern Districts 2.817, and that of the Southern Districts 2.382. The following table, derived from the Registrar General's report, shows the population in 1861, together with the number of deaths, and the number of deaths due to the several Zymotic diseases, which occurred in the year 1869, for London and its groups of districts:— Population 1861. Total Deaths, 1869. Deaths from Zymotic Diseases, 1869. S. Pox. Measles S. Fever Diph. H. Cgh. Fever Diarrh.

This is a larger number of deaths then has been registered in any previous year, and is larger by 82 than the number registered in 1868. But the returns for 186S comprised those of 53 weeks, while the returns for the present year comprise those of 52 weeks only; and if the correction necessary for the sake of accurate comparison * For statistics of births and deaths, see Tables 1 and 2 in the Appendix. 43 be made, the difference of mortality will be found to be 125 instead of 82. But it does not follow as a matter of course that the increase of deaths iu the Parish indicates a corresponding increase in its unhealthiness: it may be due, as it has hitherto been principally due, to increase in the number of inhabitants. I have shown over and over again that the population of Camberwell has been increasing during the last few years for the most part very rapidly, though not at all uniformly either as regards time or area ; and 1 have shown that this irregularity of increase has been so great, that it has been impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the total number of our population at any given time. I have latterly adopted two methods of making this calculation—methods which furnish widely different results, but between which, as extreme limits, the truth lies somewhere. The first method is that which is adopted by the Registrar-General in calculating the population of London and its districts, and which, for the large numbers there dealt with, has been proved by experience to furnish tolerably correct results: it is that of assuming the yearly increase of population, since the census-year 1861, to have been the same as the yearly increase was ascertained to have been between 1851 and 1861. There is no doubt that this method furnishes for Camberwell as a whole, and still more for Camberwell in its parts, results which are very far indeed below the truth. The second method is that of assuming . that the birth-rate remains uniform, and of calculating the population from the number of children born; but this no m ore than the other is likely to furnish accurate results, 44 and it is most probable that it errs to some extent on the side of making the population appear larger than it really is. Estimated according to the former method, the population of Camberwell in the middle of 1869 was about 89,205; estimated according to the latter, it was about 113,518. upon the former population the death-rate for the year was 2.65 per cent; upon the latter it was 2.09. The first of these death-rates is greater than that of London itself, or of any of its districts except the East; the last is far below them all. I believe that the actual death-rate lies between them, but a good deal nearer to the last than to the first. It seems pretty certain that the population of the parish has not increased so much during the last year as it did during the few years immediately preceding: it may even have decreased somewhat (though 1 doubt this). The births registered in 1869 are actually 33 less than those registered in the previous year, but if the correction be made for the extra week's births which the latter returns include, a balance of 38 appears in favour of 1869. This small increase in the number of births implies only a small increase in the number of inhabitants; and that the increase of inhabitants has been small seems to be confirmed by the comparative stagnation of building-operations, and the large number of empty houses in various parts of the parish. As regards the sub-districts of the Parish, the births in 1869 were:—in Dulwich 79 (11 more than in 1868); in Camberwell 977 (53 more than in 1868); in Peckham 1,405 45 (89 less than in 1868); and in St. George's 1,301 (8 less than in 1808); the deaths were, in Dulwich 41 (10 more than in 18(58); in Camberwell 771 (27 more than in 1868); in Peckham 790 (52 less than in 1868); and in St. George's 766 (97 more than in 1868). But here again it is necessary to make a correction for the extra weekly return for the year 1868; with this correction, there was last year, as compared with the year before:—in Dulwich an increase of 12 in the births and of 11 in the deaths; in Camberwell an increase of 70 in the births and of 41 in the deaths; in Peckham a decrease of 60 in the births, and ot 36 in the deaths; and in St. George's an increase of 17 in the births and of 110 in the deaths. These figures point pretty clearly to an increase in the population of Dulwich and in that of Camberwell, to a diminution in the population of Peckham, and possibly to a slight increase in the population of St. George's. But the great increase of deaths proportionately to the increase of births in the latter sub-district points also, and very obviously, to an undue amount of fatal disease in that locality. I will try to estimate the death-rates for the sub-districts on the same plan by which I have calculated it for the whole parish. It will be necessary for this purpose first to calculate the amount of the population for each subdistrict, second to determine the number of deaths which have occurred in each. If the sub-districts have increased since 1861 at the same annual rates at which they increased respectively during the decenniad 1851—61, then populations in the middle of 1869 were as follows:—Dulwich 1,801, Camber- 40 well 24,848, Peckham 38,152, and St. George's 24,908. But if their populations be calculated from the births, the following very different results are arrived at:—Dulwich 2,384, Camberwell 29,481, Peckham 42,396, and St. George's 39,258. Now although I do not place great reliance on either of these series of estimates, I have no doubt, for reasons which have been already given, that the latter series approximates much more nearly to the truth than the other. The registered mortality of the Camberwell sub-district is unduly swelled by the inclusion of a number of deaths which occur in the workhouse and in two lunatic asylums and which belong really no more to this sub-district than to any one of the others. No less than 271 deaths occurred in these institutions. Now if this number be deducted from the total registered deaths for Camberwell, and be distributed amongst the four sub-districts in proportion to the number of deaths which then stand against their names, we obtain the following approximation to the true mortality of the several sub-districts—Dulwich 40, Camberwell 565, Peckham 892, and St. George's 865. The death-rates spring out of the above figures. Calculating them on the first series of population-estimates, the death-rate for Dulwich was 2.55 per cent, that for Camberwell 2.27, that for Peckham 2.34, and that of St. George's 3.46; calculating it on the latter (and, as I think, more accurate) series the death-rate for Dulwich was 1.93, that for Camberwell 1.92, that for Peckham 2.10, and that for St. George's 2.20. Thus the mortuary rates alone of Camberwell and of its 47 sub-districts (which are considerably less than those assigned by the Registrar General to London and to each one of its groups of districts) would seem to show (compared at least with other parts of London) remarkable healthiness. I am not about to maintain that Camberwell has during the past year been specially unhealthy; but I fear, notwithstanding the death-rate, that it will have to be admitted that Camberwell and all its districts, more or less, have shared in the unhealthiness which has prevailed throughout the country. I have pointed out that scarlet fever, hooping cough, and diarrhoea have been the prevalent diseases of the year, and have caused an unusually heavy mortality. In Camberwell there were 164 deaths from scarlet fever (93 more than in 1868), 134 deaths from hooping cough (76 more than in 1868), and 133 deaths from diarrhoea and cholera (there were 146 in the previous year, but in the year before that there were only 73, and in the cholera year, 1866, no more than 120). I believe that the unduly high mortality of St. George's, to which I have adverted, was owing to the relatively higher mortality from hooping cough and scarlet fever in that sub-district; for of the deaths from hooping cough 2 occurred in Dulwich, 38 in Camberwell, 28 m Peckham, and 66 in St. George's, and of the deaths from scarlet fever, one occurred in Dulwich, 37 in Camberwell, 47 in Peckham, and 79 in St. George's. Other zymotic diseases have caused about their average mortality, or have perhaps been somewhat less fatal than usual. Measles caused 43 deaths, against 67 the year before; diphtheria 9 against 17; fever 46 against 45; (and 48 small pox 9 against 13. The distribution of the deaths from these diseases was as follows:—measles, 1 in Dulwich, 11 in Camberwell, 20 in Peckham, and 11 in St. George's; diphtheria, 1 in Dulwich, 1 in Camberwell, 4 in Peckham, and 3 in St. George's; fever 13 in Camberwell, 14 in Peckham, and 19 in St. George's; and small pox, 3 in Camberwell, Peckham, and St. George's severally. There is, however, another zymotic disease which does not appear in the mortuary returns as a cause of death, and which, although it threatened late last year to constitute a serious epidemic, and did in fact spread in some parts of London, caused a very small number of deaths, and in our own parish caused probably none. I speak of relapsing or famine fever, a particular kind of fever which (as one of its names indicates) has its origin in the circumstances which attend destitution. But, although originating in destitution, its ravages are by nomeans necessarily limited to those who are destitute, for it is highly infectious, and spreads readily amongst all who are brought within the sphere of its influence. The last epidemic of relapsing fever in the United Kingdom ceased in 1855; since when, up to the middle of 1868, no cases of this disease are known to have occurred in London. But for two or three years prior to 1868 it has prevailed in several parts of the Continent. It was epidemic in St. Petersburg, in 1865, in East Prussia (bordering on Poland), in 1867, and in Silesia in the spring of 1868. The first case that was recognised as one of relapsing fever in London was admitted into the London Fever Hospital from Whitechapel on the 4th July, 1868; 49 and from that time onwards during the remainder of the year several other cases of the same disease were admitted from the same neighbourhood into the Fever Hospital and into the German Hospital. Almost all of the patients were Polish Jews, and most of them were attacked shortly after their arrival in London. The disease was obviously imported into London by emigrants from infected localities abroad. In March, 1869, another Polish Jew, suffering from relapsing fever, was admitted from Whitechapel into the German Hospital; and by May it became evident that the disease was spreading from its original seat to other parts of London. Between March and the 31st of August, 39 cases were received into different Metropolitan Hospitals; and between 1st September and 15th October, 104 more. The above facts are extracted from a memorandum issued by the Medical Officer of the Privy Council on the 23rd October: which I read to the Vestry at its next ensuing meeting. The memorandum showed also that between March and the 31st August one case of relapsing fever had been sent from the Camberwell Workhouse to the Fever Hospital; and that between the latter date and the 15th October, 4 more cases had been transferred thither from our parish The well-founded fear that a serious epidemic of relapsing fever was impending, and the fact that scarlet fever was actually at the same time manifesting a very marked tendency, not only in Camberwell, but throughout London, to become unusually prevalent and severe, induced the Vestry to instruct me to put myself in communication with 50 the parochial Medical Officers, and other persons whoes duties brought them into direct relation with the poor, in order that I might through them obtain early intelligence of the outbreak, or spread of infectious diseases; to issue a handbill (see Appendix) of instructions with regard to "Measures to be adopted against the spread of Fevers," and to employ the Inspectors of Nuisances as far as possible, or as far as might be necessary in the inspection and superintendence and disinfection of fever-stricken localities. Of these two diseases, scarlet fever alone became widely epidemic, relapsing fever scarcely showed itself; at all events I never got any evidence (with one exception) that there were more than a few isolated cases in different parts of the parish, never (with the same exception) that there were even a limited epidemic outbreak. The exception here referred to was furnished by the Workhouse; which, notwithstanding the freedom of the parish generally from the disease, continued week after week (from the 15th October) to send to the London Fever Hospital a large number of cases of relapsing fever—a larger number of cases, I believe, not only than any other Workhouse in the South of London, but than any other London Workhouse, excepting only those of Whitechapel and St. Giles's. This remarkable circumstance, however, was clearly due to the fact that the disease was prevailing among the tramps who were being daily received into the Workhouse; the great majority of the patients who were transferred to the Fever Hospital were persons who had not slept in the parish until they were received into the Workhouse, and who were sent off' either at once or within 51 a day or two with the fever upon them. (See Table III). A note to the memorandum, which has been above quoted, runs as follows: "The hop-pickers, who in Sep"tember tramp off into Kent from the poorer districts of "London are, on their return, peculiarly the subjects of "epidemic disease; and this year the experience of the "London Fever Hospital has shewn that they have been "largely attacked by relapsing fever." A Report on Relapsing Fever in St. Giles's District, by Dr. Ross, points also very strongly to the same fact. There can be little doubt that the position of Camberwell in relation to the hop-growing county, and the popularity of its Workhouse due to the liberality with which it is conducted, are the essential cause of the strange prevalence of fever within the walls of the Workhouse, or rather of the strange fact that a healthy Workhouse, lying within a healthy district, should be the centre whence so large a number of fever cases have been removed to the Fever Hospital. In addition to the facts already quoted from the mortuary tables, it may be mentioned:—that during the year, 18 women died in their confinements, and 14 persons of erysipelas or allied disease; that one death was ascribed to hydrophobia, a disease which it will be recollected caused several deaths last Autumn in the South of London ; that 2 deaths were ascribed to tetanus, 3 to delirium-tremens, and 13 to inherited syphilis; that the mortality among young children was very high, 630 infants having perished in the past year, 427 between one and five, and 123 between five and ten; so that 1,180 deaths (as nearly as possible half the total mortality) occurred in the first 10 52 years of life; and that 169 persons died between 70 and 80, 77 between 80 and 90, and 8 between 90 and 100; and that, lastly, although the last quarter of the year was, as is usual, the most fatal quarter of the year, its relative fatality was, on this occasion, considerably above the average; in the first quarter there were 582 deaths, in the second 511, in the third 592, and in the fourth 683. The sanitary works done between March 25th, 1869, and March 25th, 1870, are given in Table IV. During this time 5,782 houses have been systematically inspected; in addition to which, 67 cow-houses, 50 slaughter-houses, 133 bake-houses, and 39 workshops have been under supervision; 368 miscellaneous complaints have been attended to, and 3,466 complaints about nonremoval of dust. In relation to the systematic house-inspections, and 368 miscellaneous complaints, 945 first notices were served (of which most had reference to several requirements), 70 second notices were served, and 13 summonses were taken out. As a result of these notices and summonses:—491 drains were cleansed and 462 trapped; 200 cesspools were emptied, 201 abolished, and 290 closets were provided, 60 cleansed and repaired, and 10 provided with water; 430 houses were cleansed, and 60 repaired; 8 had water supplied to them, 36 had cisterns or water butts provided, and 129 had these receptacles covered; 470 dust-bins were furnished, and 47 yards were paved. During that portion of the year in which I continued to test the quality of the gas supplied by the South Metropolitan Gas Company, I found the gas invariably, as I had 53 hitherto always found it, of good quality: its illuminating power was above the standard required by Act of Parliament, and it was free from excess of ammonia and sulphuretted hydrogen. The analysis of the waters of the three companies whose mains are distributed throughout the parish, has been kindly conducted, as usual, by Dr. Bernays, the Chemical Lecturer at St. Thomas's Hospital; and the results I have placed periodically before you. Without reproducing the figures it may be stated that in several instances the Lambeth and the Southwark and Vauxhall Companies were shown to have furnished improperly filtered water; and that the Kent Company's water, though containing a large proportion of inorganic solids, was always bright and clear and drinkable. In corroboration of this statement, and as having a special value in consequence of his making a systematic monthly examination of all the Metropolitan waters, I quote, without comment, from Dr. Frankland's Report, published by the Registrar-General, 54 the following table and the following remarks:— Number of occasions when clear and transparent. Number of occasions when slightly turbid. Number of occasions when turbid. Number of occasions when very turbid. Number of occasions when living organisms were seen. Water from the Thames: Chelsea 7 3 2 0 3 West Middlesex 12 0 0 0 0 Grand Junction 8 3 1 0 4 Southwark 4 5 1 2 8 Lambeth 5 3 1 3 5 Water from other sources: New River 12 0 0 0 0 East London 6 3 2 1 4 Kent 12 0 0 0 0 "In consequence of the frequent instances of turbidity "of the water supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall "and Lambeth Water Companies, the Medical Officer of "the Privy Council directed an inquiry to be made into "the causes of this turbidity. The investigation was en"trusted to Mr. J. Netten Radcliffe, who, in July last, "made a valuable and elaborate Report on the subject. "He found the turbidity of the Southwark and Vauxhall "Company's water to be due—1st, to deficiency of pro"vision for subsidence; 2nd, insufficiency of area of "filtering surface; 3rd, in certain instances, to the admis"sion of tidal water from the Thames into the reservoirs "at Battersea, either by direct inflow, by soakage, or by 55 "leakage; and 4th, to the admission of unfiltered water from the subsidence reservoirs into the pump-wells. Mr. "Radcliffe adds, that it should be required absolutely of "the Company that the communication of the reservoirs at "Battersea with the tidal portion of the Thames by means "of the old conduit leading to Battersea Reach, and the "direct communicatiou of the subsidence reservoirs with "the pumping-wells, should be entirely cut off.' "This Company has since improved and extended its "filtering apparatus, and during the last four months of the "year it has supplied perfectly clear and transparent "water. "As regards the turbidity of the Lambeth Company's "water, Mr. Radcliffe reports that it is due—1st, to the "objectionable source of supply (the intake being, like "that of the Chelsea Company, below the junction of the "turbid Mole with the Thames); 2nd, to insufficient pro"vision for subsidence ; and 3rd, to insufficient apparatus "for filtration. "No substantial improvement seems to have yet been "made in this Company's arrangements, as the water "delivered in December last was very turbid, and con"tained numerous living organisms." I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. S. BRISTOWE. APPENDIX. measures to be adopted against the spread of fevers. Scarlet Fever is, at the present time, unusually prevalent in Cambenvell, and Fevers of other kinds threaten to become prevalent in the parish, especially in its poorest and most crowded districts, during the ensuing winter. Under these circumstances the following suggestions, made with the object of opposing the spread of Infectious Fevers, are recommended for general adoption:— (A.) As to Precautionary Measures:— 1.—All areas, basements, cellars, kitchens, and yards should be kept dry and clean, and, if necessary, be well lime-whited. 2.—All water-closcts, sinks, and drains should be kept scrupulously clean, should be regularly flushed with water, and should have their traps in good order; they should also, if at all offensive, be kept flooded with a solution of sulphate of iron or of carbolic acid. 3.—All dust-bins should be emptied at least once a week, and no unnecessary or undue accumulation of offensive matters should be permitted anywhere. Such accumulations should (pending their removal) be disinfected by the free use of chloride of lime. 4.—All water-butts and cisterns should be kept clean and well covered. 57 5.—All houses, and especially the sleeping apartments, should be kept clean and well ventilated. 6.—Overcrowding should be avoided as much as possible. (B.) As to Measures to he taken when Fever of any kind is present:— 1.—Every person suffering from Fever should be placed as early as possible under the care of a qualified Medical Practitioner. 2.—He should be at once separated, as efficiently as circumstances will permit, from the other inmates of the house, and, if possible, should be placed in a top room. 3.—All bed curtains and other hangings and carpets, and all articles of dress, &c., in wardrobes and cupboards should be at once removed from his room. 4.—His room should be well ventilated, but not needlessly draughty; windows should be kept partially open, and the communication with the chimney free; a fire generally aids ventilation. 5.—Pieces of rag, being inexpensive, should be used for wiping discharges from the mouth and nose, and should be immediately burnt after use. 6.—A basin, containing chloride of lime or Condy's fluid, should be kept at hand to receive the patient's spit or vomit. 7.—The discharges from the bowels and kidneys should be received into vessels charged with the same disinfectants. 58 8.—A pail, also containing solution of chloride of lime or Condy's fluid, should stand in the room for the reception of all bed or body-linen after removal from the person of the patient. 9.—All glasses, cups, and other utensils should be scrupulously cleaned before being used by others. 10.—The hands of the nurse should be washed with carbolic acid soap, and rinsed in water containing Condy's fluid; her dress should be of cotton. 11.—All articles of dress in use by the nurse or patient, and all articles of a like kind liable to be infected, should, before they are removed from the room in which the patient lies, be put into a solution of chloride of lime or Condy's fluid, and should afterwards be washed and boiled, or burnt. 12.—The room should be thoroughly disenfected after it has been emptied. A good plan is to burn an ounce or two of brimstone on a hot brick in the middle of the room, the door, windows, and other outlets having been previously closed. J. S. BRISTOWE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Cambemvell, October, 1869. N.B.—If Fever appears in any place, information of its appearance should be given to the Medical Officer, or to the Inspector of Nuisances. Complaints as to Nuisances, or Non-removal of Dust, should be made personally or by letter to the Inspector of Nuisances.

Dated this 2nd day of May, 1870, and continued by adjournment until the 7th June, 1870. Walter Charles Mulley, Geo. M. Coghlan, James Edward Innes, P. Fawcett, R. Keen, Auditors of the Parish of St. Giles, Cambenvell. In the examination of the Rate Books, great inconvenience has been experienced from the mode in which the Recapitulation has been rendered by the Collectors, causing much unnecessary labour, and resulting in many clerical errors in one or two of the Books, which, having to be corrected by the Auditors themselves, entails upon them an amount of responsibility which it is not consistent with their office they should be called upon to undertake. It having been brought to their knowledge that a Cum- 113 mittee of the Vestry is now sitting on the Book-keeping arrangements of the Parish, we venture to request that before those gentlemen make their final report, we may be allowed to attend before them, and express our opinion on the subject. We desire also to place on record our high appreciation of the services rendered to the Parish by Mr. Berry (Clerk to Mr. Marsden), through whose careful attention, assiduous exertions, and ability as an Accountant the numerous Books and Documents submitted to us have been kept with an amount of neatness and accuracy which is highly satisfactory; and at the same time to express our thanks to him for the courtesy and attention he has shown and for the valuable assistance rendered to us during a protracted audit of fifteen nights.
