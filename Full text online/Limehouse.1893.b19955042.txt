IMPROVEMENT BEN jONSON ROAD. The question of widening the western end of Ben Jonson Road was again brought before the Hoard in September 1893, when a letter was received from the Ratcliff Vestry suggesting the propriety of carrying out the improvement on the Ratcliff side of the street. The letter was referred to the Works Committee, and upon their recommendation the Board decided to again ask the London County Council to seek Parliamentary Powers for the widening of the thoroughfare in accordance with the plan originally prepared and it an estimated cost of £4,000, one half of the cost being contributed by the Council and the other half by this Hoard and the Vestry of Mile End Old Town in equal proportion. A communication was sent to the Council in accordance with this Resolution, and on the 7th February, 1894, a joint deputation from the Hoard and the Mile End Vestry waited upon the Improvements Committee in support thereof. A reply was subsequently received to the effect that the Committee had resolved to recommend the Council to seek Parliamentary powers to enable the Vestry of Mile End Old Town to carry out the improvement, one half the cost not exceeding £3,070 being borne by the Council, one fourth by this Hoard and one 54 fourth by the Vestry; also that upon hearing that this proposition was the Board and the Vestry the Committee would take up its report to the Council. In answer to this, the Council were informed that the Hoard would be glad if the Council would obtain parliamentary powers for carrying out the work . but that having regard to the Resolution passed by the Hoard on the 6th May 1891 lmiting the amount of the Board's contribution to £1,000 the Board could not agree to the Council's proposal so far as the amount to be contributed was concerned. A letter was received in reply stating that the Improvements Committee was unable to regard the decision of the Board as an acceptance of the terms proposed by the Committee, and that therefore they would not be prepared to recommend the Council to seek Parliamentary powers as suggested. In December, 1893, a letter was addressed to the Board by the Limehouse Vestry forwarding copy of a Resolution to the effect that unless the re-erection of the Victory Bridge was included in the scheme for the improvement of Ben jonson Road such improvement would be of no avail and would not meet the requirements of the District. In reply the Vestry were informed that the Board heartily concurred in the spirit of the Resolution and would be pleased to co-operate-in any movement win tinobject of improving the Victory Bridge, but that as the same was not within the District they could take no action in the matter. NEW THOROUGHFARE FROM BROAD STREET TO CRANFORD STREET. The suggested formation of a new thoroughfare from Broad Street to Cranford Street, Ratcliff, his been further considered by the Works Committee from time to time during the year, but no decision has yet been arrived at upon the subject. WEST END OF NARROW STREET. In April, 1893, the Works Committee (to whom, as stated in my last Annual Report, this matter had been referred) recommended the Board to undertake the proposed widening of 55 the west end of Narrow Street. Ratcliff. in accordance with plans which I has prepared and at an estimated cost of £1,640, exclusive of legal and other expense. The Hoard adopted the recommendation, and as authorised I proceeded to negotiate with the owner of and other parties interested in the several properties required with a view to the purchase of the same. In May I reported that the cost of the acquisition would be as follows, viz Nos. 13, 15 & 17, Narrow Street £541 No. 19. Narrow Street 985 No. 31, Narrow Street 1 £1527 The Committee recommended the Hoard to approve the same and to leave the matter in my hands to conclude the necessary arrangements The recommendation, however, was referred back to the Committee to ascertain whether better terms could be made with the parties interested, and the Committee having inspected the several premises the Hoard resolved not to proceed with the improvement utile- a reduction of .£200 was made in the aggregate of the claims in respect of the properties required. Further negotiations thereupon took place with Messrs Walker & Harrison the owners of No. 19, Narrow Street, but they declined to reduce the amount of their claim as settled. The Hoard ultimately rescinded the Resolution above referred to and the matter was then again considered by the Committee who recommended the Hoard to proceed with the portion of the improvement westward of Messrs. Walker & Harrison's premises and to acquire Nos. 13, 15, 17, and 21 upon the terms already arranged. The recommendation was adopted and the ncccssary steps lor the acquisition of the properties are now in progress. 56 NARROW STREET (FROM DOWSON’S dock to NIGHTINGALE LANE. LIMHOUSE) The question of the possibility widening the roadway of Narrow Street, Limehouse nearDowson’ Dock was referred to the Works Committee for consideration, and I summitted to the Committee a plan shewing the proposed widening of the thoroughfare from the west side of the Dock to Nightingale Lane. The Committer made an inspection of the locality, and I was requested to make an estimate of the probable cost of the improvement. PROPOSED NEW STREET FROM NARROW street TO MEDLAND STREET. In consequence of the receipt in March. 1894, of a Ietter from the occupier of New Sun Wharf, Ratcliff, calling attention to the congested state of the traffic in Narrow Street, the works Committee made an inspection of the thoroughfare and I submitted a plan shewing a proposed new street running from Narrow Street to Medland Street and I was requested to prepare an estimate of the cost of the improvement it MEDLAND STREET As requested by the Works Committee. I considered the question of widening tile carriageway of that part •! Medland Street between London Street and Horseferry Branch Road. I found that in consequence of a break of 2 feet 6 inches in the South frontage of me Street near Gin Alley it was not practicable to make the carriageway sufficiently wide for the passage of two vehicles. If the carriageway were widened to 15 feet, the least possible width for two vehicles, it would only leave 6 feet at the west end, 4 feet 5 inches in tin- centre, and 6 feet 5 inches at the cast end for the two footways, a width quite inadequate and likely to lead to serious accidents. The subject was referred to the Works Committee for consideration, and upon their recommendation the Board authorised me t o form two lay-byes for carriages in Medland Street, one near London Street and one at the east end near Horseferry Branch Road, and the work has been carried out. 57 IIOUNlffU OF Till-: WOKKIMi CLANNKN ACT queen CATHERINE COURT AREA In Octobcr. 1893. an Order was made by the Local Government Hoard lor sanctioning the scheme for the improvement of this area, subject to the following conditions viz :— " (ay Suitable dwellings, according to plans to be prepared " by the Local Authority, and agreed upon between them and u the London County Council, -hall be erected on the area com" prised in the Scheme for the accommodation of one hundred M and eight persons of the working class: • I'roviiled that 111 the event of a difference arising between "the I .oca I Authority and the London County Council with " rcHpecl to such plans, the same shall be referred to us, and " our decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.

In the month of July, in conscquenCC of OOnpUMl Oi emanations from the sewers on the Cotton I .-state at Limeh«»u «. 1 had openings made in various parts ami examined the >ew« and found them to be clear and free from dep< »sit, except in so: few Cases near the flushing .which were tin* d< iuK ol the sewers. I thereupon reported to the Board that in my opinion the bad smells arose from the Main Low Level Outfall Scwcr into which the sewers discharged throu -h tlu St. Paul's o r> Road sewer. The Works Committee requested me to call the attention of the London County Council to the matter, with a view to their providing effluvia flaps at the junctions, a course which in my opinion would to a very grt at « xtent remedy the evil complained of. Complaint having been made of nuisance can led by noxious effluvia proceeding from manholes to sewers under the control of the Board, I caused the same to be temporarily stopped Up, in the hope that if the County Council carried OUt the workB I had suggested the cause of complaint would be removed. 59 In September I communicated with the Council as to nuisances caused by the escape of effluvia from gulleys conncctcd with the Main Sewer at the west end of Narrow Street, Ratcliff; and also from the District Sewers on the Cotton Estate which proceeded from the Low Level Main Sewer; I afterwards received replies Stating that steps had been taken to prevent the continuance of the nuisance. Mr. lehmon. of Salmon Lane. Limehouse, informed the Hoard that he had invented an apparatus for preventing stench arising from the sewer, and for sending fresh air into the same, and that he would be pleased to fix one at his own cost for the inspection of the lioard. Mr. lehmon attended a meeting of the Works Committee and described his invention, and the apparatus was ultimately fixed in Gill Street, Limehouse; but it was not satisfactory in its operation, and at the present time the consideration of the matter stands adjourned in order to give Mr. lehmon an opportunity of effecting some alterations. MORTUARY ACCOMMODATIONS, &c. A- stated in my last Annual ort, plans shewing the pro|>o*rd utilisation of the Railway Arches in Little John Street, KatdifT, for mortuary and disinfecting purpose** were submitted to the Local Government Hoard for approval. In April, 1893, a letter was received from the Secretary of that lioard stating that as the provision of a Mortuary was a purpose for which the Hoard might borrow without their sanction, they did not decin it cx|>cdicnt to offer any comment upon the details of that structure; but that the character. |>osition, and arrangements of the Disinfecting Chambers and Post-mortem Room were not such as would justify them in sanctioning a loan for the erection thereof. I'hercu|>on the Medical Officer and my>ell had an interview with IJr. 11. 1-ranklin Parsons, one of the Medical Officers of the Local Government Hoard, when the matter was very fully discussed and certain alterations suggested in the plans, and it was arranged that amended plans should be submitted. I accordingly prepared fresh plans which were approved by the lioard and forwarded to the Local Government lioard who, 60 however, replied in June, 1893, that they would not be prepared to sanction a loan for works upon a site held on a yearly tenancy, and that the amended proposals were in their opinion so far undesirable as to render it expedient that the district board should abandon their scheme for the utilisation of the arches in the manner contemplated. The letter of the Local Government Board was considered by 1 Sub-committee appointed by the Sanitary Committee who went very' fully into the matter and inspected several sites which had been suggested as suitable. After much consideration the sub. Committee made their Report to the Sanitary Committee upon whose recommendation the Board in December last resolved to acquire a site in Horseferry Branch Road, Ratcliff, at. a cost of £2,200, and to pay the costs of the Vendors in connection with the purchase. I he necessary steps for the acquisition of the land arc now in progress. The Board also considered the advisability of erecting a Coroner's Court upon part of the site referred to. and in reply to an enquiry the London County Council stated that they Would be prepared to pay for the use thereof if provided by the Board a rent calculated at £3½ per cent. of the cost of the land and building, plus a fair allowance for maintenance, The matter is now under the consideration of the Sanitary Committee. EAST LONDON WATERWORKS BILL. The Works Committee had under consideration a Bill introduced by the East London Water Works Company, to empower them to raise money and to carry out certain works. Upon their recommendation a communication was addressed to the London County Council calling attention to the Memorial presented by the Board with reference to the Bill introduced by the Company during the previous session, and asking them to give consideration thereto in their opposition to the present Bill. LONDON STREETS AND BUILDINGS BILL. In December last the London County Council forwarded copy of a Bill to consolidate and amend the enactments relating 61 to streets and buildings in London, and asked whether the Hoard had any suggestions to offer thereon. Copies of the Hill were furnished to each member of the Hoard, and the same was considered at a Special Meeting of the Works Committee, and upon their recommendation the Hoard directed that a representation be made to the Council objecting to the following clauses of the bill:— Clause 9—Position of new buildings with reference to streets. Clause 18—Conditions attached to consent to building in front of general line. Clause 31—Space where domestic building re-erected in narrow street. Clause 33—Existing buildings contravening part of Act. Clause 38—Heights of buildings in certain cases. Clause 136—Regulation of lamps, signs, &c The Council were also informed that the Hoard was of opinion that Clause 30, as to space at the rear of new buildings, should apply to domestic buildings only. The Bill is at present under the consideration of the House of Commons. THAMES CONSERVANCY BILL. A Hill having been introduced into Parliament for the purpose of re-constituting the Thames Conservancy, copies of of the Bill were obtained, and the subject was considered by the Works Committee, who did not think it necessary for the Board to take any action thereon. , LONDON COUNTYCOUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) BILL. The attention of the Board having been called to certain provisions of this Bill, copies thereof were obtained and fur- 62 nished to each member of the Board. I made a Report upon the subject, and after consideration the Board decided to present a petition to the House of Commons against the Bill. The Points to which objection was taken will be seen from the follwing copy of the petition:- " In Parliament, "Session, 1894. "LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) BILL. "PETITION AGAINST.

The Hill was under the consideration of the House of Commons at the time of closing this Report. USE OF FIRE HYDRANTS FOR FLUSHING. In response to an invitation of the London County Council, delegates were appointed to represent the Hoard at a Conference convened to consider the advisability of framing clauses for insertion in a Hill to authorise the use of Fire Hydrants for flushing and other purposes. The Conference took place on the 17th November, when there was a general but not unanimous opinion that it would be well for the hydrants to be used as suggested. In the course of the discussion several points were submitted on which it was thought the Local Authorities should be consulted, and the Fire Brigade Committee of the Council therefore submitted the questions which arc printed below, together with notes thereon which 1 laid before the Works Committee when the subject was considered :— "1.—Is it desirable that Local Authorities should be " allowed to use Fire Hydrants ? Note 1—" No advantage would be gained by the use of the "present Fire Hydrants for (lushing and watering purposes. If 66 "so used, there would neccessarily be a divided resposibility as "to the user of the hydrants, and it would be in most cases "almost impossible to detect how any damage had arisen: it "would also be necessary to provide a meter so as to register "the quantity of water used for fire purposes, and that used "for flushing &c. " 2—Should Local Authorities provide hydrant* for their "own purposes ? Note:-Yes; it would be more convenient to do so; and "it would be advisable, as the question has cropped up, to make "arrangements if possible with the Water Company for them "to provide water for flushing and street watering purposes at "their own expence, or at a nominal charge. 3.-What proportion of the cost of providing and main- "taining hydrants shall be borne by the local Authorities? Note:—" This is a difficult question as there are at present "no data to work upon. "4.—Who is to be responsible for the hydrant being " serviceable in the event of fire. Note :—"The London County Council. 5.-Who is to be liable in the event of damage resulting "from the leakage of water from hydrants consequent on user by "a Vestry or District Board? Note:—"The London County Council and the Local " Authority. "6.—Who is to be liable for the cost of repairing any "hydrant which may be damaged in the course user a " Vestry or District Board? Note:—"The London County Council. "7- What safeguards arc to be employed to Prevent hydrants being damaged by use in frosty weather? Note : " The London County Council. 07 "8.—What arrangements are to be made to insure that " mud and rubbish shall not be sweot into the sewers whilst "thoroughfare are being watered ? Note :— Same as at present." After a very exhaustive consideration of the subjcct, the Board decided to reply in the negative to the first of the above questions, and the remaining questions therefore required no answer.

Gordon Thompson to erect a Roman Catholic Church on the south side of St. Paul's Road, to a line shewn upon a plan accompanying the letter of the Supcrintendin; Architect, a strip of land partly in Limchouse and partly in Poplar being thrown into the public way. he Board approved The sal, and directed that so much of the piece of land referred to a in the Limehouse District should be paved when the building works were completed. At the present time the church is in course of erection. CHARLES PLACE. In November, 1893, the Rcccivcr of the Shadwell Estate informed the Board that the Estate would, upon certain conditions. be willing to give uP the necessary land in the rear of the site of Nos. 147 to 152, High Street, for the purpose of continuing the widening of Charles Place, the widening having already been carried out in the rear of Nos. 153 to 161, and Nos 143 and 146. The Works Committee considered the matter and made an inspection of the place, and upon their recommendation the Kcccivcr was informed that the Hoard would be prepared to continue the widening as suggested, and would pave and maintain the widened portion as part of the public thoroughfare, but that the Estate must bear the expense of erecting the necessary enclosure hoarding or boundary wall to the new line of frontage. HAMMER AND CROWN COURT. The Brd, in February, 1894. gave their consent to the enclosure by Messrs. Batger site of Hammer and Crown Court. Katcliff pon condition that the frontage of the projecting building in the Orchard, at the corner the Court, was set back to a line drawn from the existing frontage of the buildings on the north side of the projection to the south west corner of Hammer own Court, and that the site of the projecting building was surrendered to the Hoard to be thrown into the public way. BRIDGES ACROSS THOROUGHGARES. In September, 1893, a communication was received from the London County Council, stating that the Council had refused an application by Messrs. Murray and Foster for permission to erect a bridge to connect the first floors of the Phtenix Wharves Company's premises, Nos. 18 and 21, Narrow Street, Katclitf. As the Hoard had previously, so far as it was empowered to do so, given Permission truction of the bridge in question, a Deputation was appointed by the Board to wait upon the Building Act Committee of the Council for the purpose of placing the views of the Board before them. the utation 70 duly attended, and as a result the Committee Consented to withdraw their opposition to the application, and the same was thereupon granted by the Council subject to certain conditions ELECTRIC LIGHTING. The Special Committee appointed by the Hoar.! This subject held several meetings and visited the work of the St. pancras Vestry, and recommended the board to engage the services of Professor Henry Robinson. M lint C I. and M Inst. E.E, to report as to the adopltion of the electriv light in the District. The Hoard adopted the recommendation and Professor Robinson accordingly made an exhaustive report. which is still under the consideration of the Committee. The Report dealt with the desirability or otherwise of the Board undertaking an installation of clectric lighting. the beM scheme for supplying electrical energy to the District the cost carrying it out, the probable results as regards both public and private lighting, and a Supplemental Report included a large number of statistics upon the subject. SNOW STORMS Snow storms occurred in the mouth of January. 1894 When a total of 367 extra men were en a ed iti clearing the streets, the total cost being £57 8s. 6d. DUST REMOVAL In June, 1893, I made a Report upon this subject as to the probable cost of carrying out the work by the Board without the intervention of contractors. The same was referred to th Works Committee for consideration, and they reported to the Board that they were of opinion th it the present system should be continued for the time being.the Board approved the report of the Committee. GREAT EASTERN BAILWAY. The Company have submitted to the Hoard the plans of proposed alterations and improvements at Stepney Station, and have intimated that the works will shortly be commenced. 71 RAILWAY BRIDGES. A letter was received from the London County Council stating that it had been decided to endeavour to get clauses inserted in all Hills promoted by Railway Companies with a view to requiring the Companies among other matters to make all their bridges watertight, and to make provision for deadening as far as Possible the noise of passing trains. The Council asked the Hoard to do all they could to second the Council's efforts, and the Hoard replied that they would be pleased to Co-operate for the purpose referred to. MAPS OF THE DISTRICT In accordance with a Resolution of the Hoard, a large map of the District has been Prepared shewing the sewers in the District, and the same has been mounted and placed in the Committee Room. A scries of smaller plans has also been completed shewing the house drainage. A small folding map of the District has been preparer! and copies printed for the use of the members. ADVERTISING ON LAMP COLUMNS. In order to enable the Hoard to form an opinion as to the advisability of making an arrangement with Messrs. Heath, of Biriningham, for the adoption of their system of advertising on lamp columns, that firm fitted up a sample lamp in Commercial Road, at the corner of White Horse Street, but the Hoard having inspected the same decided not to entertain Messrs. Heath's suggestion. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Survtj'or of the Board.
