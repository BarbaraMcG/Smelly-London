EBAR032 THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE HEALTH and SANITARY CONDITION OF THE EAST BARNET VALLEY URBAN SANITARY DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1909. BY WALTER ROUGHTON, F.R.C.S. (ENG.) (Diplomate in Public Health), MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. WITH THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SANITARY INSPECTOR AND BUILDING SURVEYOR, ARTHUR J. ABBOTT, P.A.S.I., A.R.S.I., Member Institute Sanitary Engineers. Printed by W. W. Morgan, Fleet Steam Works, Plantagenet Road, .New Barnet. REPORT. The District of East Barnet Valley (Urban) is situate in the administrative county of Hertford, and comprises the sub-districts of East Barnet, Barnet Vale, and Monken Hadley, the area being 2,636 acres. It lies on the sides of a valley extending from Hadley on the north, to Brunswick Park on the south, where it adjoins the parishes of Southgate and Friern Barnet. It is bounded on the east and west, respectively, by the main roads leading from London northwards, through Southgate and Barnet. The general character of the District is residential, changing from Rural to Urban, or to that which is generally termed suburban; the houses for the most part consisting of detached or semi-detached villa residences, together with a number of small houses and cottages sufficient at present for the needs of the working classes. A considerable increase in the number of houses suitable for the working classes is taking place in the southern extremity of the district. 4 Population.—I estimate the population to be 12,963, an increase of just upon 330. This estimate is based on the number of occupied houses—2,446—multiplied by 5.3, the average number of persons per house at the census of 1901. Birth Rate.—During the year 1909 there were registered 277 births. The birth rate was 21.5 nearly. This is a fractional increase on the previous year. Of the 277 births six were illegitimate. Death Rate.—The number of deaths that were registered as having actually occurred in the district was 119, giving a death rate of 9.2 per 1,000. But 16 deaths occurred in various public institutions, viz., the Barnet Infirmary, Victoria Cottage Hospital, and the County Asylum, which must be credited to the district, raising the total deaths to 135, and giving a corrected death rate of 10.4 per 1,000. Infant Mortality.—Ratio of deaths under one year of age per 1,000 births registered. Under this heading 20 deaths were registered, giving a rate of 72 per 1,000. It must be noted that 11 of the 20 deaths were due to premature birth, so that only 9 can be said to have been due to preventible causes. But for the accidents of premature birth the rate would have been only about 40 per 1,000. 5 No deaths were caused by epidemic diarrhoea —a disease prevalent in hot weather—doubtless because the summer of 1909 was decidedly a cool one. Measles was responsible for 5 deaths. The disease was very prevalent in the neighbourhood of Brunswick Park during the month of June, and the School was closed by the advice of the School Medical Officer for a period of three weeks, which period was prolonged by the Managers arranging that the summer holidays should commence earlier than usual. In November the Potters Road School was also closed by the Managers on account of the lack of attendance caused by the prevalence of measles among the children. It may be here pointed out that the closing of a School is effected either by the order of the Sanitary Authority or by the action of the School Managers. The former is compulsory, the latter is optional. Closure by order of the Sanitary Authority is hardly ever likely to be called for, so the matter will rest in the hands of the School Managers. If, on the outbreak of infectious disease in a class, the susceptible children were excluded at once, it is probable that the outbreak would be Arrested, and closure, with all its 6 venience and disturbance of educational work, avoided. Whooping Cough, which was so prevalent in 1908, was practically absent in 1909, and only 1 death was attributed to it. Scarlet Fever showed a considerable diminution in the number of cases notified as compared with the year 1908, for only 28 cases were notified in 1909, as against 41 in the previous year. All the cases were of the mild type, and no deaths occurred among them. This mildness of type makes it difficult to trace the origin of the disease in many cases, and one is forced to the conclusion that at times mild, unrecognised cases exist, and spread the infection. One case I suspected of being a "return case," as the child was taken ill a few days after the return home of another child of the same family from the Isolation Hospital. Diphtheria.—24 cases of this disease were notified, of which 4 proved fatal. It cannot be said that any epidemics occurred, for with one or two exceptions the cases occurred at irregular intervals throughout the year. Neither can it be said that the Schools were the means of spreading the infection. In many cases it is impossible to trace the source of infection. On one occasion 7 when three children were seized with the disease I discovered that one of the children had assisted home a little friend who was taken ill in the streets with what proved to be diphtheria, and a day or two later the former child developed the disease, and its two sisters immediately followed suit. Several of the cases were undoubtedly infected outside this district. One arrived ill from Liverpool. The plan of keeping a supply of antitoxin at the Council offices is much appreciated by the medical practitioners, and I am glad to report that they show an increasing desire to avail themselves of the advantages of free bacteriological examinations offered by the Council. Disinfection of Rooms and Schools is carried out by spraying Formaldehyde on the walls and bulky articles of furniture, etc., and the destruction of clothing and bedding when necessary. This is done under the immediate supervision of the Sanitary Inspector. But it cannot be pretended that for the efficient disinfection of bedding, clothes, books, and toys this method is as reliable as that by steam. Unfortunately the steam apparatus at the Isolation Hospital is useless for cases outside the Hospital, as pointed out in my last Report. As efficient disinfection is as important as isolation, as a necessary consequence I would suggest that a 8 disinfecting station be erected in the Lancaster Road, on the ground belonging to the Council, where there is plenty of room. Isolation Hospital.—This was opened in the month of January 1909. During the year 22 cases of scarlet fever and 10 of diphtheria were sent to it. The buildings are constructed of galvanised iron lined with match boarding. Such buildings are never satisfactory, and I am informed that great difficulty was experienced at first in keeping the wards sufficiently warmed at night, but this has been remedied by adding another stove in each ward. Already the match board lining shows signs of shrinking and opening. I would strongly urge the erection of a convalescent or discharge block. At present patients are practically discharged straight from the wards to their own homes, at the risk of conveying infection thereto. Indeed, two cases of what are called return cases of scarlet fever have occurred to my knowledge. Water Supply.—This is partly constant and partly intermittent. Brunswick Park, a portion of Hadley, and nearly the whole of East Barnet have a constant supply, and negotiations with the Barnet District Gas and Water Co. are now in progress for supplying all those parts which are more than 270 feet above level. The water 9 is derived from deep wells sunk in the adjoining districts, and is of remarkable purity. No water is supplied from private wells. Sewage Disposal. — Water - carriage: Closets are nearly all connected to main sewer; there are very few cesspools. The farm is about 40 acres in area. The sewage is treated by intermittent downward filtration. After running through the land the sewage is collected in settling tanks when, without treatment, it is run on to coal breeze filters, and the effluent discharged into Pymme's Brook. Several schemes were submitted to the Council during the year for dealing with the growing requirements of the district, and the matter is still engaging the attention of the District Council who recognise the necessity for doing something to improve the treatment of sewage. Whatever scheme is adopted it must be borne in mind that clay soil is quite unsuited to the treatment of sewage, and therefore efficient artificial means must be adopted. Road Dust and Motor Traffic.—The dangers to health and the inconvenience caused by road dust are well recognised. The beneficial results of tarring the East Barnet Road and the to Great North Road at Hadley have been greatly appreciated by the tradesmen and residents generally. I think these benefits might with great advantage be extended to the Station Road, which is now such an important means of communication in the neighbourhood. About a mile and a half has already been tarred. House Refuse.—An experiment was made with a covered cart, but did not prove a success, owing to the roof or covering being rapidly knocked to pieces in the action of tipping the loads. There does not appear to be a covered cart on the market suitable for use where the tipping arrangements are such as exist in most suburban and rural districts. Enquiries are, however, still being made in this direction. In the meantime tarpaulins are used to cover the carts and so mitigate any nuisance arising in dust collecting. Milk Supply.—This is obtained chiefly from outside the district, and but few cows are kept to supply milk for home consumption. The milk shops and dairies are all in good condition, and reasonable precautions are taken to keep the milk from contamination. One cowshed that was the cause of a good deal of dissatisfaction has been abandoned by the owner. The new regulations issued by the Local I r Government Board have been in force since July 1907. The following Bye-laws are in force in the district: Common Lodging Houses. New Streets and Buildings. Slaughter Houses. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops. Nuisances. Cleansing Footways and Pavements. Offensive Trades. Adoptive Acts in force : Infectious Diseases (Prevention) Act, 1890. The Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1890. Practically the whole of the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1907, has now been adopted by the Council. I have much pleasure in annexing to this Report that of the Sanitary Inspector and Building Surveyor, Mr. Arthur J. Abbott, whose excellent work and hearty co-operation I desire to acknowledge, and I would particularly like to call the attention of the Council to his valuable remarks on the Town Planning Act. I also append certain statistics on vaccination, at the request of the County Medical Officer of Health. t2 Return of Vaccinations and Statutory Declarations of Objection to Vaccination in the East Barnet Valley Urban District received by the Vaccination Officer during the year ended 31st December 1909: Number of cases.

Six of the trade and other buildings included in the above, under the heading "plans disapproved," have been granted licenses as temporary buildings under the provisions of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act of 1907, the licenses being 21 renewable annually at the discretion of the Council. Four of these buildings are situate in the parish of East Barnet, and one each in Barnet Vale and Monken Hadley. New Houses Completed.—The number of new dwelling houses certified for occupation during the year was eighty-four, made up as follows : Parish of East Barnet 52 ,, Barnet Vale 21 ,, Monken Hadley 11 Supervision of Buildings.—In connection with the supervision of new buildings, the following duties have been performed since taking up my appointment on 13th September last, viz.: Number of inspections of new buildings during construction 291 Number of drainage tests applied (hydraulic) 57 Number of contraventions of by e-laws detected and remedied 25 New Storm Water Drains.—During the year the re-construction of drainage systems has been carried out on eleven different premises, and in each case advantage has been taken of the opportunity to lay new separate drains for the storm water, with the result that the surface drainage from roofs and yards of twenty-six houses has thus been separated from the soil sewers. Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act 1909.—I wish to call special attention to the provisions of this Act, which, if judiciously applied, are, I consider, likely to be of considerable value in securing control over the various factors at work in promoting the further development of this important residential district. It provides the necessary powers whereby 22 the Council may, if it so desires, secure that all future development within the district (or outside also) shall proceed only along such lines and in such manner as is laid down in an approved, comprehensive plan and scheme for the whole or any part of the district which the Local Government Board may, on application, give the Council sanction to prepare. It is worthy of note, also, that in addition to securing the convenient and systematic planning of roads and streets, permission may also be included in the scheme to control such matters as the reservation of adequate open spaces, preservation of objects of historical interest or natural beauty, restriction on the number of houses per acre, and, what is of much importance in this district, control over the height and character (including architectural features, value, etc.) of the buildings to be erected in any particular street or district. The importance of this latter provision cannot be too strongly emphasised, as at present it often happens that the development of a street or district on approved lines is arrested, and its value deteriorated by the erection of an undesirable class of property, over which there is at present little or no control. With these safeguards, however, it would be possible to secure, within reasonable limits, that properties of certain values should be confined to prescribed areas. The development of the district is at present practically in the hands of Land Companies, private owners, and builders, and is carried out in such manner as yields the best returns to the interests involved. In the arrangement of the roads, however, the district is particularly free from the ill-effects of bad planning. I observe that considerable areas of land in all parts of the district are in the market for disposal for building purposes ; also that building operations in the adjoining district of Barnet 23 have at one point been continued up to the boundary of this district, into which the new road has been continued; and also that several roads within the district have at present only one outlet. It is in reference to this partially developed land, and the land ripe for building purposes, that a town planning scheme would seem to be desirable at no distant date. The larger question of the careful and complete laying out of the whole district, so far as it is likely to be developed, although perhaps not of immediate importance, is one which should commend itself to the careful consideration of the Council, having due regard to the ultimate growth of the district, by reason of its close proximity to the Metropolis. The development of a district, street by street, by different owners, without regard to the amenity, convenience, and style of the whole, cannot be productive of the best results. The present unique opportunity of controlling, by means of a complete and comprehensive scheme, the future character of the whole district, therefore appears to be worthy the fullest investigation, and in the carrying out of which considerable foresight will be called for to secure the best results to posterity. The Act provides that schemes of town planning may be prepared by any owner, or combination of owners of land, but the assumption seems to be that the initiative will be taken by local authorities in conference with the owners. The evident application of the Act to this class of district, together with the improvements which I notice while carrying out my duties as your Building Surveyor, are to be derived from its operation, prompt me to offer the foregoing observations. I beg to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ARTHUR J. ABBOTT, P.A.S.I., etc., Building Surveyor. East Barnet Valley Urban District Council. SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT FOR 1909. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith the First Annual Report on the work of the Sanitary Inspector's department, for the year 1909. I have, as far as possible, endeavoured to embody the whole of the work executed during the year, but owing to the absence of detailed and tabulated records I am only able to supply definite information relating to the period during which I have personally held office, viz., 13th September to 31st December. The figures given in the accompanying summary have been obtained from a careful perusal of the notices issued, correspondence, &c., and are believed to be correct. Where the figures refer only to the short period mentioned above the fact has been indicated. Legal Proceedings.—It will be noticed the year's work has been accomplished without recourse to legal proceedings, which is very satisfactory. The greater portion of the remedial works have been executed in compliance with a preliminary notice of an informal character, and thanks are therefore due to owners of property for readily co-operating with the Sanitary Authority in promoting the welfare of the district. Works Executed without Notice.—It will also be noticed that since September last works have been executed in ten instances without the service of any form of notice. Most of these works have been the reconstruction of drainage systems, at considerable expense, and have been carried out under my supervision. 25 Factory and Workshops Act, 1901.—I have no record of any notices issued, or other action taken under this Act during the past year, and owing to the absence of records I have been unable to furnish the information required for the official tables as to the inspections made, and defects found during 1909. I have, however, made various inspections of factories and workshops in the district, since my appointment, and am now giving this matter my careful attention, with a view to making a personal inspection of all the premises, and also of revising the existing registers. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milk-shops.—No legal action has had to be taken during the year in reference to the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milk-shops within the district, which are believed to be in a satisfactory condition. Considerable improvements have been carried out under my supervision at a dairy in East Barnet, in accordance with the notice of the Sanitary Authority, ensuring greater protection of the milk supply against contamination. Numerous changes having occurred in the ownership of these small businesses, I find the revision of the existing register is necessary, and I now have this work in hand. Slaughter-houses.—Only four slaughter-houses exist within the district, these being kept in a very cleanly manner, and no nuisance has occurred in connection with same. P.H.A. Amendment Act 1907.—During the year the Public Health Acts Amendment Act 1907 has come into force in the Council's district, and I have pleasure in noting that the additional powers therein conferred upon the Sanitary Authority will be of considerable assistance in controlling various matters affecting the public health, and in promoting and maintaining a high standard of sanitary conditions in the District. I have already taken advantage of its provisions, and 26 consider the measure will be most useful in assisting the work of my department. Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909.—The chief provisions of this Act, affecting the administration of the Sanitary Department, are those dealing respectively with (a) Amendment of procedure for securing Closing Orders and Demolition Orders in respect of houses unfit for human habitation, (b) Maintenance of houses for the working classes in a condition reasonably fit for habitation. In the former case the old and cumbersome method of obtaining Closing or Demolition Orders from the Courts has been superseded by a drastic alteration of the law which now makes it the "duty" of the local authority to make a Closing Order, on the report of any of their Officers, or other information, if satisfied that any house is dangerous or injurious to health, or unfit for habitation. Demolition Orders may be made in a similar manner. These orders are, however, subject to appeal to the Local Government Board by the persons on whom they are made. It will thus be recognised the usual procedure is greatly simplified, which should considerably facilitate effective dealings with property of this class. The second provision referred to enables the local authority to exercise control over the state of repair in which houses let to the working classes (in this district at rentals not exceeding £16 per annum) are kept, with power to inspect and issue notices requiring the execution of specified repairs, which are considered necessary to make the houses reasonably fit for human habitation. I regard this as an important provision, long overdue, and consider that its operation will enable the sanitary authority to maintain a more reasonable standard of habitable repair, in this class of property, which should have a beneficial result on the. 27 health of what is usually the most thickly populated part of a district. I append hereto a brief summary of the matters dealt with by my department during the year, but, for the reasons previously mentioned, and owing to my having held the appointment for only three and a half months of the year, it is necessarily incomplete. I hope, however, to be able to give more detailed information in future reports. Assuring the Council of my continued efforts to promote the welfare of the district. I beg to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ARTHUR J. ABBOTT, P.A.S.I., Associate Royal Sanitary Institute.
