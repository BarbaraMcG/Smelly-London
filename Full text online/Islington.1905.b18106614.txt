To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington. Gentlemen, I herewith have pleasure in presenting you with the Fiftieth Annual Report on the health of the people and the sanitary state of your borough, and in doing so I am very glad to be able to congratulate you on the satisfactory condition of both. I had thought on this occasion to have reviewed the changes that have occurred here during the last fifty years, but I found that unfortunately such a review might easily fill a volume much larger than this report. Nevertheless, it would have been of the deepest interest to have traced the great social changes that have occurred in this, the greatest of the London boroughs, changes which are so typical of those that have taken place throughout our vast Metropolis in the same period. Much has occurred in the half century to alter the physical character of the borough since my old friend and counsellor, Doctor Edward Ballard, penned his first annual report, the most noticeable circumstance being that, whereas when he took office there were ample open spaces, green fields and pastures new, albeit they were being rapidly encroached upon for building purposes, there is none to-day, for they have been covered with prosaic bricks and mortar; and that whereas the inhabitants then numbered just on 100,000, to-day they approximate to 343,000. Then was Islington in its most virile state, it was literally increasing by leaps and bounds, for I find that from 1841 to 1851 its population increased by 70 per cent., and from 1851 to 1861 by 63 per cent., or by no less than 100,000 in twenty years. Then, too, the birth-rate was flourishing, and caused no anxiety, for it was no less than 35 per 1,000, its mean between 1851 and 1861 being 34.5 per 1,000, while to-day it has fallen as low as 25.5 per 1,000. Curiously enough there has been very little change in the marriage rate, which then averaged 18 per 1,000 viii. inhabitants, and to-day is 17.4. In 1855 the death-rate of the old parish stood at 22.8 per 1,000, being preceded in 1854 by a rate of 25.0, and followed in 1856 by one of 21.7 per 1,000, which increased gradually until in 1866 it rose to 28.0, and to-day it only reaches the very low figure of 14.4 per 1,000, or 48.5 per cent. less than then, which is a truly marvellous decrease, especially when it is considered in the light of the fact that the population has all through the intervening period been gradually changing from an upper class and good middle class to one that is a middle, and most largely artizan, class. Such a fall in the death-rate is in itself an infallible indication of the great improvement that has occurred in the sanitary circumstances of Islington, and proves incontestably that modern sanitation has added greatly to the health, and, therefore, the happiness, of the people, who should not be unmindful of these great blessings, which have been brought about by the incessant labour of men who have given their time without fee or reward to the service of this great community, and to its officials who piloted it safely on its course, which happily just now seems beset with no danger either from within or without. I would wish here to say that I have much appreciated the kindly manner in which my reports and recommendations have been received by the Public Health Committee, and yourselves, and particularly to thank the Chairman of that Committee, Alderman Smallwood, for the support and assistance he has invariably afforded to myself and to the staff of my Department. I also desire to acknowledge the willing services that have been accorded to me by my colleague, Mr. J. R. Leggatt, the Chief Inspector, and by Mr. George King, my chief clerk, as well as by every member of my staff, in carrying out the work of the Department which daily grows larger, more important, and more onerous, and the vast amount of which, I am afraid, is not generally known to the people, possibly because it has been, for the most part, performed unobtrusively and without friction, and therefore has not attracted attention. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Islington, N. June 1st, 1906. X SUMMARY of Vital Statistics, 1905.

POPULATION, AREAS AND DENSITIES OF THE SUB-REGISTRATION DISTRICTS, THE WARDS and THE BOROUGH. B 3 [1905 REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1905. AREA, POPULATION AND DENSITY. The several ratios relating to the vital statistics of the borough during the year 1905, with which this report deals, have been calculated on the basis of the figures which have been estimated by the Registrar General. Population of the Borough—The estimate of the population has been based on the census returns of 1891, 1896 and 1901. It is not possible to say that this estimate is absolutely accurate, but in all probability it will be found when another census has been taken that no serious error has been made. It had been expected that a Quinquennial Census would be taken this year (1906) for the purposes of the equalisation of rates, but for some unknown reason the enumeration has not been made, although the London County Council have pressed the matter on the Government. In 1901 it was ascertained that in every 1,000 of the population 108 were under 5 years of age. 118 were between 5 and 15 199 „ „ 15 „ 25 182 „ „ 25 „ 35 130 „ „ 35 „ 45 93 „ ,, 45 „ 55 60 „ „ 55 „ 65 31 „ „ 65 „ 75 and 12 from 75 years upwards. b 2 1905] 4 These figures show that a change has gradually been coming over the distribution of the ages of the population, as in 1891 there were— 118 under 5 years of age. 206 between 5 and 15 200 „ 15 „ 25 172 „ 25 „ 35 124 „ 35 „ 45 87 „ 45 „ 55 54 „ 55 „ 65 28 „ 65 „ 75 and 11 from 75 years and upwards. No doubt there is some tendency to-day for the population to decrease in its younger years of life and to increase in its later, which has been brought about by the steady decrease in the" birth rate. The estimated population of the borough at the middle of the year was 342,994 persons, of whom 163,066 were males and 179,928 were females. Of this number 36,873 were below 5 years of age, while 60,355 were between 5 and 15 years; 68,260 between 15 and 25; 62,473 between 25 and 35; 44,675 between 35 and 45, while 67,358 were above this last mentioned age. It is estimated also that there were 92,489 women living in the Borough at a child-bearing age, viz., between 15 and 45 years old. This fact is of importance in considering the birth rate. Population of the Sub-Registration Districts.—The population of the several sub-registration districts has been estimated at the middle of the year as follows:— Persons. Persons. Tufnell 33,622 Highbury 66,336 Upper Holloway 35,607 Barnsbury 54,091 Tollington 35,549 South-East 76,147 Lower Holloway 41,642 Total 342,994 5 [1905 Population of the Wards—The population of the Wards has been also estimated, with the following results:— Persons. Persons. Tufnell 33,622 Thornhill 33,454 Upper Holloway 35,607 Barnsbury 20,637 Tollington 35,549 St. Mary's 17,389 Lower Holloway 41,642 Canonbury 32,271 Highbury 34,982 St. Peter's 32,855 Mildmay 24,986 Total 342,994 Density of the Borough.—The density, that is to say the number of persons living on each acre of the borough, shows only a very slight increase, namely from no persons per acre in 1901 to in in 1905. This figure, however, is very much greater than the average for the County of London, which is slightly over 62 to every 1000, actually 62.6, and is very much above the majority of the Metropolitan Boroughs For instance, Woolwich, with a population of 125,000 persons, has a density of only 15.1 persons to every acre, while 20 other boroughs have a density below that of Islington. On the other hand, 7 boroughs show a density greater than this borough, the highest being Southwark with 184 persons to the acre. In comparing the death rate of Islington with the rates of the other communities of London, this fact should not be forgotten. As has so often been pointed out, density has a very considerable bearing on mortality; the greater the density as a rule the greater or higher the death rate. The figures for the County of London, as well as for its various boroughs, including the City of London, are set out in table III. Density of the Sub-Districts and Wards.—The densities of the several sub-districts and wards are given in tables. I and II. Area.—Islington, although it is the most populous of the Metropolitan Boroughs, only stands seventh on the list with respect to its area, which is 3,092 acres, the districts which are larger than it being Woolwich, Lewisham, 1905] 6 Greenwich, Wandsworth, Camberwell, Hackney and Lambeth. When its area is contrasted with the great towns, it is found that Huddersfield, for instance, with less than a third of its population covers 11,000 acres; that Sheffield with about the same population is spread over 19,000 acres, Leeds over 21,000, Nottingham over 10,000, and Birmingham over 12,000. Consequently the population of Islington lives on a very much more confined area than that of these large towns, and is, therefore, handicapped by its environment. The areas of the sub-registration districts and the Wards are given in tables I. and II. Table I.

MARRIAGES, BIRTHS AND DEATHS. 1905] 12 MARRIAGES. The number of persons married in the year was 5,968, which corresponds to a rate of 17.40 persons married per 1,000 of the population, which is 0.51 below the mean rate of the decennial period 1893-1904. It is also the lowest rate with one exception registered in this period, for in the preceding year it was only 17.29. During the ten years the rate varied from 15.97 in 1895 to 19.35 in 1899, since which year the tendency has been downwards, although there was a slight recrudescence in 1902 and 1903. The marriage rate varied greatly, as usual, in the different periods of the year, for in the first quarter it was 12.06, in the second 17.61, in the third 21.85, and in the fourth 18.07. It is impossible to give the ages of the persons at marriage; and in this connection it may be noted that for a long period past the Registrar-General has ceased to give tables in his annual report showing the ages at which the population married, although generally there is a brief statement in his introductory letter.

Compared with the mean birth rate of the decennial period 1895-1904, that of 1905 showed a deficiency of 2.48 per 1,000. In addition to this, the rate was the lowest experienced in the borough for 59 years, for it is necessary to go back to 1842 to find such a low return in proportion to the population, at which period it was 25.28. The Islington rate was also lower than that of England and Wales, which was 27.2; of the 76 great towns, which was 28.2; and of the 140 smaller towns, which was 26.9. The decrease in the birth rate of the country, as pointed out in previous reports, has caused considerable anxiety, but notwithstanding all that has been written about it, no improvement seems likely to take place. The later period of life at which men and women marry, the employment of women in industrial occupations, and, indeed, in professional capacities, have without doubt had a considerable effect in the diminishing the nativity, apart from the fact, of which there cannot be any possible doubt, that means for preventing conception are now very largely and systematically used, and that prudential restraint has had its effect. If we turn to the figures for the sub-districts in Islington, which will be found in Table XII., it will be found that those districts which are the most affluent show the least birth rate, while those on the contrary that are occupied by persons in less fortunate circumstances show a larger number of births in proportion to the population. It is hardly possible to consider the present low birth rate as a mere passing event, or that one can look forward hopefully to an increase in the birth rate, and as this fact can hardly be controverted in view of what is occurring in nearly every civilized country, attention has been more and more concentrated on the possibility of saving a large proportion of infants who die annually before they attain the age of 12 months. This endeavour is the only good feature about the ever diminishing births in the community. Sex.—The males born numbered 4,435, and the females 4,321, the former being to the latter in the proportion of 97.4 to 100. 1905] 16 Illegitimate Births.—The births registered as born out of wedlock numbered 227, which is the smallest number registered in the borough since 1863. They were in the proportion of 0.66 per 1,000 of the population. The following statement gives the birth-rate for the country as well as for some of the most populous places :— England and Wales 27.2 per thousand living. 76 Great Towns 28.2 „ „ „ less London 27.2 „ 141 Smaller Towns 26.9 „ London 27.1 „ Birmingham 29.3 ,, Liverpool 33.3 Manchester 29.5 ,, Leeds 27.1 „ Sheffield 29.8 ,, Bristol 27.0 ,, St. Pancras 24.7 ,, Stoke Newington 20.5 ,, Hackney 25.8 ,, Hornsey 18.5 „ Finsbury 34.7 Shoreditch 33.5 The Encircling Districts 26.5 ,, Islington 25.5 „ The total Births and Birth-rates in the seven Sub-districts were as follows:— Births.

The deaths registered in the borough during 1905 numbered 4,955, including 653 deaths that occurred in public institutions outside Islington, and were in the proportion of 14.44 per 1,000 of the population. On one occasion only since civil registration was instituted has the death-rate fallen lower than this figure, namely in 1903, when the proportion was 14.27. In the preceding 10 years the mean death-rate was 16.56 per 1,000 of the population, while in the whole period 1828 to 1904 it averaged 1974 to every 1,000 persons. It is not always possible to compare accurately past with recent years, because the proportion of persons at the different ages may have been different at the different periods. Nevertheless, whatever this proportion may have been, it cannot account for the very substantial decrease that has occurred during the last 35 years, and especially since 1891 The proportion of mortality to population in the borough steadily increased from 1838 down to 1866, from which year there has been a gradual decrease, which was accentuattd from 1891 to the year already mentioned. It may be here stated that the death-rate of the borough was 1.3 per 1,000 below the rate of the 76 great towns; 0.64 per 1,000 below that of the County of London; nearly ro per 1,000 below that of England and Wales, and 0.5 per 1,000 below that of the English rural districts. It was also below the death-rate of the Encircling Boroughs, which comprise St. Pancras, Stoke Newington, Hackney, Hornsey, Finsbury and Shoreditch, and of which Stoke Newington, Hackney and Hornsey showed a lesser death rate. In these cases, however, there is reason to believe that the state of the population, both with respect to well being, as well as age incidence, is favourable to a low death-rate. Sex.—Of the 4,955 persons who died, 2,498 were males and 2,457 were females. The proportion of deaths among the former being 15.31 and amongst the latter 13.65 to every 1,000 persons of each sex living. It might be stated that the greatest decrease in the mortality occurred among children who had not reached 12 months of age, at which period of life it was found that compared with the preceding 10 years there had been 268 deaths less registered. Such a decrease as this is very gratifying, especially as it has been accompanied by a decrease of 161 deaths among children who are over one year old, but who had not attained to five years old. Thus the total 1905] 22 increase in young life when compared with the average from 1895-1904 was 429. This saving in juvenile life is the best proof that any community can show of its good sanitary condition. As a survey of the mortality for a period of years is of interest the returns from the first year of civil registration to the end of 1905 are appended. The death-rates which follow have been calculated for each year on a careful estimate of the populations as revealed by the census returns which were obtained at the close of each successive decade.

The mortality at the different ages ranged from 1.83 per 1,000 between 5 and 15 years of age to 129 per 1,000 among persons above 75 years old. Under 5 years old the mortality was at the rate of 44.45 per 1,000, while from 15 to 25 it was 275 per 1,000, from 25 to 35, 5.09 per 1,000; between 35 and 45, 8.50 per 1,000; between 45 and 55, 16.52 per 1,000; between 55 and 65, 28.52 per 1,000; between 65 and 75, 61.64 per 1,000. (Vide Table XVI.) Mortality in the Sub-Registration Districts.—These districts showed a general improvement, indeed some of them were exceedingly healthy; thus, for instance, Tollington, with 428 deaths, showed a deathrate of only 12.04 per 1,000, and it was followed closely by Highbury, where 837 deaths were registered, and whose death-rate was 12.61. Then came Tufnell with 483 deaths, and a death-rate of 14.36; next to this was South East Islington, where 1,116 deaths occurred, but whose death-rate was only 14 65; next in order was Upper Holloway, with 550 deaths and a death-rate of 15.44, while Lower Holloway, where 644 deaths were known, was 1905] 24 credited with an almost identical death-rate, 15.46, and lastly, Barnsbury was responsible for 897 deaths, with a death-rate of 16.58. Thus it is seen that the death-rate of each district was exceedingly good, even that of Barnsbury, especially when the nature of the district is taken into consideration. Now the least healthy of these sub-districts showed a less mortality rate than that of several of the London Boroughs. For instance, in Holborn it was 17.5, in Finsbury 19.0, in the City of London 17.4, in Shoreditch, 19.7, in Bethnal Green 18.6, in Stepney, 17.7, in Poplar 17.6, in Southwark 18.5, and in Bermondsey 18.7, which returns accentuate the general healthy condition of Islington. Mortality in the Wards.—An examination of the several death-rates of the wards shows that they range from 12.52 in Mildmay, where 313 deaths occurred, to 16.67 in Barnsbury, where 344 deaths were registered. Here, too, the same fact is apparent that no ward was unhealthy, as even the highest death-rate, 16.67 per 1,000, must be considered a very favourable rate in a population where for the most part the people live in tenements or in houses let in lodgings, which are occupied by several families. The several deaths and death-rates are set out in Table XVIII., where they can be studied. It may, however, be stated that in the first quarter of the year the death-rate in Canonbury Ward was only 12.64, in the second quarter the death-rate of Tollington only reached 10.46, while in the third quarter the death-rate in Mildmay was as low as 9.60, and in the fourth quarter the deathrate of St. Mary was only 13.80. SEASONAL MORTALITY. In the first quarter the deaths, which numbered 1,316, were 342 less than the corrected average of the preceding ten years, and were in the proportion of 15.35 to every 1,000 of the population. This rate was the lowest hitherto recorded at this period of the year, and was 3.98 less than the preceding .decennial average. In the second quarter there were 1,178 deaths registered, or 83 less than the corrected average of the preceding ten years, while the mortality was at the annual rate of 13.73 per 1,000 of the population, and was with two exceptions, the lowest hitherto recorded at this period, which is usually very healthy, the mean rate for the previous ten years having been only 14.7. 25 [1905 In the third quarter only 1,076 deaths were entered, as compared with the corrected average of 1,310 in the preceding ten years, and they were equal to an annual death-rate of 12.55 Per 1.000 of the population, as against a mean death-rate of 15.27 per 1,000 in the years 1895-1904. Only once before, namely in 1903, was so low a death rate recorded, at which time it was 12.16 per 1,000. In the fourth quarter the deaths, which numbered 1,385, were 67 less than the corrected average of the preceding ten years, and were equal to an annual death rate of 16.15 per 1,000, as compared with a mean decennial rate of 16.93 per 1,000.

During the year the Infantile Mortality, that is to say the deaths of infants under one year of age, was in the proportion of 123 to every 1,000 births, as compared with 144 during the preceding twenty years. It is also the lowest mortality rate on record in Islington, and it compares very satisfactorily not only with the infantile mortality rate of England and Wales, where it was 128; of the 76 great tawns, where it was 140; of the 141 smaller towns, where it was 132, but it is also less than the mortality in the boroughs which encircle Islington, where it was 132. It is also less than the infantile morta lity rate of the County of London, which was 129 per 1,000 births. In the sub-districts the rate reachcd from 101 per 1000 in Upper Holloway to 151 in Lower Holloway. It is difficult to understand why this difference should have arisen in these two districts, but it may be partly accounted for by the fact that in some parts of Lower Holloway the people are not so well off, and do not live amidst such comfortable surroundings, as in the former district. The cause of the low mortality cannot be ascribed to the lesser prevalence of epidemic diarrhoea, which is often the main factor in the death-rate of infants, as the returns show that the deaths from this disease, which numbered 149, exceeded the mean of ten years by only one. The chief causes of infantile mortality are set out in Table XXV. which shows that with the exception of the disease mentioned, Syphilis and Developmental diseases alone showed an increase. On the other hand, Marasmus and Atrophy decreased from an average of 165 to 107, Bronchitis from 116 to 77, Pneumonia from no to 107, Premature Births from 176 to 163, and Convulsions from 59 to 38, while other diseases decreased to a lesser extent. Tiie infantile mortality rates since 1885 are set out in the following table :— Years. Deaths, under 1 year. Deaths per 1,000 Births. Years. Deaths under 1 year.

Hitherto no special effort has been made in this direction in Islington, and indeed it was not required here so much as in the large towns and in some other of the London districts, for it cannot be said that the infantile mortality in Islington when compared with that of the Country, the Great Towns, and the other London Boroughs, was excessive. Indeed, the contrary is the case, for as the writer has shown for several years past, it has been most satisfactory. Nevertheless it is quite possible, by educating parents, and especially young mothers, to reduce even the low mortality experienced in Islington. The methods usually adopted are to place in the hands of mothers short directions as to the feeding, care and rearing of their infants, and to supplement these directions by visits of Health Visitors, who are women thoroughly conversant with these matters. Another practice adopted in a few places has been the establishment of depots for specially prepared milk, for undoubtedly dirty or unsound milk plays a large part in infantile mortality. It is, however, an arguable point whether such establishments should be supported out of the rates or be conducted by private enterprise. There is much to be said in support of each contention, and as this matter will in all probability receive consideration in a special report, it is not proposed to discuss it now. Suffice it to say that in Islington it would require to be on a scale much larger than any hitherto adopted in the metropolis, and would probably involve the purchase of a Dairy Farm in the country, or else the subsidising of one, for it goes without saying that the place from which the milk would come should be conducted on the most perfect sanitary lines, as otherwise there would be a danger of the supply not being as pure and satisfactory in other directions as it should be. 39 [1905 Table XXV.

These are Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fevers (Typhus, Enteric and, Continued), and Diarrhoea. The return of 529 deaths from these diseases is with one exception the smallest hitherto recorded and is 280 below the corrected average number of deaths for the 20 years preceding. They were in the proportion of 1.54 to every 1,000 persons living in the borough, as against a mean death rate of 2.36 1905] 40 in the years just mentioned. Thus there was a decrease of 280 deaths in the gross numbers, and of 0.82 per 1,000 in the death rate. Each disease, with the exception of Diarrhoea, showed a decrease, and even this disorder was only 1 above the average of the preceding 20 years. The death rate of 1.54 was practically the same as that of England and Wales, but was less than that of the 76 great towns, where the proportion was 1.88 per 1,000 inhabitants; it was also only very slightly higher than the death rate of the 140 smaller towns. When the returns for past years are examined, it is found that there has been a steady decrease, of course with occasional increases, so that to-day the mortality rate from these diseases has fallen 58.3 per cent, since 1885, which is an exceedingly satisfactory fact, and shows that the preventive means adopted, not only locally, but throughout the metropolis, have been successful in combating them.

There was one death from this disease during the year. This case occurred at 45, Winchester Street. The patient was an Italian who had only arrived in this country a short while previous to his attack and had not been well since his arrival. Owing to the severity of the disease it could not be ascertained whether he had been vaccinated or not. He was of course removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospital, where he subsequently died. This case caused considerable anxiety as he was one of eleven male Italians who lived with their wives and children at this address. They were, however, prevented from going to work, were interned in their homes and given a sum of money to provide for their immediate necessities. This death from Small Pox was 10 below the corrected average of the preceding twenty years. In London 9 other deaths from this disease were known, 2 in Hackney, 2 in Shoreditch, 1 in Stepney and 4 in Lewisham. The deaths in the Borough in previous years have been as follows:— Years. Deaths.

Measles was credited with 123 deaths, or 70 below the corrected average of the preceding twenty years, and were equal to a death-rate of 0.36 per 1,000 of the population, which is almost the identical rate of the County of London, wherein it was 0.37. 49 [1905 In the country generally the rate was 0.10 per 1,000 less than the average for the preceding ten years. This disease, although below the average, nevertheless caused considerable anxiety, because when once it has gained access to a school (and it must be recollected that in these modern times our schools are attended by almost the entire youthful population, all of whom are more or less susceptible to the disease when they commence their schooling) it is almost impossible to stay its spread unless by the closure of the class room or school immediately the first two or three cases have appeared. It is very satisfactory to note that the whole question of the prevention and the spread of measles in the elementary schools has been receiving the most careful attention of the Education Committee of the London County Council and their Medical Officer, Dr. Kerr, and that a careful investigation has been proceeding for the last few years in Woolwich.

Scarlet Fever, whose records once upon a time showed hundreds of deaths annually, is not now nearly so fatal, and in the year under observation only 37 deaths were registered from it, or only two more than in the preceding year, a return which is 12 below the corrected average of the preceding 20 years. In the report for 1904 a table was given showing the number of deaths that have occurred in Islington in the several quinquennial periods since 1856, and is well worthy of reference as showing the enormous decrease which has occurred in the mortality from it. This decrease has been specially noticeable since 1890, from which time to the present the deaths have never exceeded 94 in any one year. Indeed, compared with the mortality in the quinquennium, 1891-1895, the return has fallen 50 per cent., for whereas the average annual number of deaths in those years was 66, in the last similar period it was only 33.

Only once, and that was in 1904, have the deaths from Diphtheria been so few as in 1905, when only 34 were registered as compared with an average of 127 in the 20 years 1885-1904. There was thus a decrease of 66 deaths in the year's return. From 1861 to 1895 the mortality from the disease steadily increased, but from that period to now there has been a steady fall, so that while in the quinquennium 1891-1895, 842 deaths occurred and in the following five years 1896-1900, 678 were registered, yet from 1901 to 1905 only 343 deaths were known. The 34 deaths were equal to an annual death rate of 0.10 per 1000, as compared with a rate of 0.12 in the County of London and a similar rate in the boroughs encircling Islington. The returns from this disease since 1861, set out in quinquennial periods, have been as follows :— Deaths.

The deaths from this disease showed a considerable decrease, the number registered being 111, as compared with a corrected average of 177 in the 20 years 1885-1904, so that the return revealed a diminution of 66. This number is, however, above that of the preceding year, when only 83 were registered. It does not appear to have been unusually fatal in any part of the Borough even where its greatest incidence occurred, in Tufnell Sub-district, in which the rate was 0*39 per 1000, as against an average rate for the Borough of 0*32. On the other hand in South Islington the mortality was only in the proportion of 0.25 to every 1000 inhabitants. Since 1885 in Islington the returns have been as follows:— Years. Deaths. Years.

Enteric Fever caused only 17 deaths, which is the lowest return hitherto recorded, the previous minimum number having been 18 in 1904. In the quinquennial period 1896-1890, the deaths averaged 52 per annum ; in the five years 1891-95, 37 per annum; in the five years 1896-1900, 44; and during the last five years 1901-1905 to 20 per annum. This return shows that since sanitation was actively pursued in Islington the mortality from this disease has steadily fallen.

Nil return. CONTINUED AND ILL-DEFINED FEVERS. Nil return. DIARRHŒA. The deaths from diarrhoea according to the returns tabulated in the Public Health Department numbered 206. This is not inclusive of 109 deaths ascribed to Enteritis but is inclusive of those deaths which are classified under the term " Epidemic Enteritis " or " Zymotic Enteritis." It is, however, 28 above the return of Diarrhoea as given for the Borough in the Registrar-General's Annual Summary for London. The figures here given are, however, correct, as the tabulation has been made with the greatest care in the Public Health Department. Compared with previous years, it is above the corrected average number of deaths from 1885 to 1904. This of course is no doubt due to the fact that it was not until recently that epidemic or zymotic enteritis was classified under the heading of Diarrhoea and, therefore, the increase in the return is only apparent and not real. The death-rate from the disease represents an annual mortality of o-6o per 1,000 of the inhabitants, and compares favourably with the death rate in the County of London, where it was 072, and with the Encircling Boroughs, in which the rate was 079. 0 It is satisfactory to find that the deaths from diarrhoea are not excessive when compared with other places, although it is not pleasant to note that as usual the mortality has been greatest in the early periods of life, for an examination of the return shows that 150 of the deaths occurred among children under one year old, and of these the greatest number were noted in the third quarter, when 119 deaths were registered among these infants. The causes that give rise to Diarrhoea have been discussed in many previous annual reports, and, therefore, it is not proposed to enter on the subject more fully now, except to emphasise the fact that there is no doubt that the manner in which milk is kept in the houses of the lower classes renders it liable to contamination and deterioration, and as a consequence greatly promotes diarrhoea, sickness resulting in a large percentage of deaths. 62 1905] It has been recently stated that flies are a great factor in the contamination of milk. This undoubtedly is true and was recognised both by Dr. Ballard and the writer in discussing the matter together many years ago in Sunderland, a fact which no doubt would have been published long ago if that gentleman had lived long enough to complete the work to which he devoted so large a proportion of the closing years of his life, and of which only a preliminary part was published.

Influenza, which in 1904 caused 48 deaths, in 1903 40 deaths, and which showed a corrected average of 83 deaths in the 10 years 1895-1904, was responsible for 54 deaths so that there was a decrease of 29 on the corrected returns of the preceding decennium. The number of deaths registered in the several quarters was respectively 26, 16, 3 and 9, each of which with the exception of the 2nd quarter showed a decrease on the corresponding quarters of the preceding ten years.

Twenty-nine deaths from Appendicitis were registered during the year, of which 17 were those of males and 12 of females. This return is one above that of 1904, and 21 above that of 1903, and 8 above that of 1902. In the last annual report it was pointed out that this disease might be described as inflammation of the appendix caecum vermiformis, which is a long wormshaped tube or process situate at the commencement of the large intestine. The cause of the disease has not been over well defined, but it is more than probable that all attacks of true Appendicitis are the result of the action of bacteria, while its severity depends upon the virulence of the microbe, as well as upon the power of resistance of the patient. It may also be ascribed to a faecal concretion or to foreign bodies, such as fruit stones or other hard and small particles which have gained access to the intestine. There is no doubt that its more certain diagnosis has led to fewer of the attacks escaping detection, and hence the increase in the disease is more apparent than real. The ages of the persons dying from the disease were as follows:— 0 to 5 years 1 5 „ 10 „ 4 10 „ 15 „ 1 15 „ 20 „ 6 20 „ 25 „ 3 25 „ 35 „ 3 35 „ 45 „ 4 45 „ 55 „ 4 55„ 65 „ 2 65 „ 75 ,, 1 Thus it appears that the disease was most fatal among persons from 15 to 20 years old. It is a notable fact that no death was registered as from any of the institutions situated within the Borough. SEPTIC DISEASES. 39 deaths were ascribed to these diseases, of which Erysipelas, Puerperal Fever and Pyaemia are the best known. 73 [1905 Erysipelas.—The returns show that 12 deaths were registered from Erysipelas, or two less than the corrected average of the preceding 10 years. These were equal to a death rate of 0.03 per 1,000 of the inhabitants. It was fatal to only one infant, the remaining deaths being among persons who had passed the age of 35 years. Of the deaths, 8 occurred amongst males and 4 among females. Table LVII. Deaths from Erysipelas in the Sub-Districts during the Year 1905. Deaths Death Rates. Tufnell — per 1,000 inhabitants.

The return is 5 below the average of the preceding 10 years, and is equal to a mortality of 0.68 per 1,000 births. It is to be hoped that the low figure now reached will not be exceeded in the future, and indeed there is hope that this may be so, from the fact that midwives are now very closely supervised by the London County Council and by the Public Health Department of the Borough.

This classification includes, among many others, such diseases as Rheumatic Fever, Rheumatism, Rickets, Cancer, Consumption of the Bowels, Tubercular Meningitis, Phthisis, Purpura, Anaemia and Diabetes, and was the ascribed cause of 1,007 deaths, as compared with an average mortality of 1,089 in the preceding 10 years, so that there was a decrease of 82 on the average of the previous returns. It is gratifying to note that this is the lowest figure hitherto obtained. The mortality was in proportion of 2.94 to every 1,000 of the inhabitants. Cancer and Malignant Disease.—328 deaths were ascribed to cancer and malignant disease, or 5 more than in the preceding year.

Amongst men it caused 138 deaths or 8.41 deaths per 10,000 living, while among females it was responsible for 190 deaths or 105.0 per 10,000. The mortality thus appears to have been greater amongst the latter than amongst the former. In Table LXI1. showing the deaths and death-rates from the diseases at seven age periods, it is noticeable that from 25 to 55 the death-rate among women is greater than amongst men, but that in the next age period, 55 to 65, the positions are reversed, the mortality being greater among men; then again in the next age period its greatest incidence reverts to females, to whom it was very fatal. A study of the table is instructive. The several organs that have been affected with the disease are set out in Table LXIII. where it also distinguishes the sexes. The distribution of the disease throughout the year, and in the subregistration districts, was as stated in the following table. 77 [1905 Table LXI.

Phthisis—Phthisis caused 438 deaths or 112 less than the corrected average of the previous 11 years. The return is the lowest that has been recorded during this period, and represents a mortality of 1.28per 1,000 of the inhabitants, as against the average in the years stated of i*6i. The mortality from Phthisis represents 8.84 of the deaths from all causes, which also is a reduction of 0.89 on the proportion in the eleven years.

The disease is one of early life and is without doubt amenable to protective measures, the carrying out of which, however, mainly devolves on the mothers of the children. Tubercular Meningitis or Hydrocephalus was noted as the cause of 63 deaths, of which 32 were males and 31 females. With 13 exceptions all were among children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis of the Larynx caused 4 deaths, all of which occurred among persons who were above 25 but under 55 years of age. General Tuberculosis was registered as having caused 24 deaths, of which 7 were under 1 year old, 11 between 1 and 5, and the remainder above this age. Other Tubercular Diseases were responsible for 12 deaths. The ages of the deceased ranged from 1 to 55 years. G 1905] 82 Table LXV. Showing the Deaths from the Tubercular Diseases during 1905.

These diseases, which annually cause a very large proportion of the total deaths, include among others Acute and Chronic Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy and Asthma, and were responsible for 1,007 deaths, of which 336 occurred in the first quarter, 222 in the second, 96 in the third and 353 in the fourth, from which return it will be seen that they were most fatal in the first and fourth quarters. They resulted in a death rate of 2.93 per 1,000 of the population and they formed per 20.3 cent, of the mortality of the year. Bronchitis, Acute.—This disease was credited with 175 deaths, 86 being females, and 89 males, of which 73 were infants under one year old, while there were also 114 among children under five years old. Bronchitis, Chronic.—This disease was responsible for 344 deaths, nearly all of which occurred among people over 45 years of age. It was fatal to 155 males and 189 females. Pneumonia was registered as causing 426 deaths, of which 129 occurred in the first quarter, 117 in the second, 42 in the third and 138 in the fourth. The deaths among males were 243 and amongst females 183. The great fatality of this disease among infants and very young children has been pointed out in previous reports, and therefore it is not surprising to find that 1905 was no exception to the general rule, for it was fatal to 107 infants under 1 year and to 113 among children above that age but under 5 years, thus making a total of 220 children under the latter age. Altogether there died from Bronchitis, Pneumonia and the other respiratory diseases 188 infants under 12 months old, and 349 children under five years old, thus making a total of 537. The large number of deaths at these ages from these diseases is a striking testimony to the want of care and attention shown by parents to their young offspring, particularly those that are infants, for many of these deaths from these respiratory diseases would never have occurred if they had been paid to them. Exposure to night air, cold winds, and bad weather in company with their mothers are without doubt considerable factors in the causation of Bronchitis and Pneumonia among infants. 65 [1905 VENEREAL DISEASES. Under this heading are included Syphilis and Gonorrhoea, and to these were credited 18 deaths, 16 being registered from the former, and 2 from the latter disease. It is a noticeable fact that as many as 13 out of the total number of deaths from the venereal diseases occurred among children who had not attained their first year, which brings to mind the scriptural adage as to the parents eating sour grapes and the children's teeth being set on edge. Only 4 adults died from venereal disease. Four of the deaths occurred in the Public Institutions within the borough. ALCOHOLISM. Notwithstanding the fact that drink is the cause of much sickness, it is interesting to note that only 3 deaths were ascribed directly to alcoholism, and that each of the deceased were males. The recorded mortality from alcoholism has of late years declined both amongst men and women throughout England and Wales, and at the same time the deaths from Cirrhosis of the Liver have also decreased; consequently, the Registrar-General in his last report writes that "it is permissible to hope that there has been, at any rate, no increase in the loss of life by intemperance. Inasmuch, however" (he goes on to say), "as it is impracticable to obtain an accurate expression of the mortality indirectly caused by the use of alcohol, it would be rash, in the face of the data, to assume a substantial improvement in this direction until the fallen mortality of those diseases that are most obviously associated with this habit shall have become more pronounced than is at present the case." In another part of his report he notes that "the mortality from Hepatic Cirrhosis showed a tendency to increase in the closing years of the last century, but since the year 1901 it has shared in the decreasing fatality of liver diseases generally." 1905] 86 Thus it appears that the returns generally show that there are fewer deaths credited to those diseases usually associated with alcoholism, and that they are a true indication of the more temperate habits of the people there can be little doubt, for, simultaneously with this decline, the Excise Authorities have shown in their recent reports a distinct falling off in the revenue derived from alcoholic beverages. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. The returns of the deaths in the Public Institutions and Hospitals are, it has been frequently pointed out, to some extent a gauge of the poverty of the people, as it affords a good indication of the amount of relief that has been given by medical charities. Assuming that this is so, then there can be no doubt that the year through which we have just passed, as well as 1904, have been hard ones for the people, for more persons died in these institutions than in each of the preceding two years, and indeed the return, with the exception of that for 1899 and for 1902, was the highest of which note has been taken in Islington. Nevertheless, the excess of deaths has not been great, for an examination of the returns given in Table LXVII. shows that they had only amounted to 5 when compared with the preceding year, and with 42 in 1903. In 1902, however, the return amounted to 1,646 as against 1,581 now recorded, and with an average of 1,470 in the 10 years 1895-1904. The proportion of deaths in the Public Institutions was 31 per cent, of the deaths from all causes as compared with 26.3 per cent, in the preceding 10 years, which is a notable increase. Within the Borough.—During the year 1,526 persons died in the Public Institutions of Islington, of whom 962 were residents and 564 were non-residents who had gone to them to be treated for the diseases from which they ultimately died. The greater proportion of the strangers, 357 in number, died in the Holborn Infirmary, Archway Road. Residents.—By far the larger proportion of the 962 residents died in the Workhouse Infirmary, they numbered 680; in addition to whom 129 died in the Workhouse, while 126 died in the Great Northern Central Hospital, and 3 in the Holborn Infirmary. Besides these, there was 1 death in the 87 [1905 Aged Pilgrims' Asylum, 1 in St. Pelagia's Creche, 3 in the Tufnell Park Nursing Institution, 1 in the Drovers' Almshouses, 2 in the London Fever Hospital, 5 in the Memorial Cottage Hospital, 1 in the Bookbinders' Asylum, 1 in the Clothworkers' Almshouses, and 1 in St. Andrew's Nursing Home. There were also six deaths in Holloway and Pentonville Prison Infirmaries. Non-residents.—Of the 564 deaths of non-residents, 357 died in the Holborn Union Infirmary, 92 in the Great Central Hospital, 32 in the Workhouse Infirmary, 6 in the London Fever Hospital, 9 in the Aged Pilgrims' Asylum, 29 in St. Pelagia's Creche, 4 in the Memorial Cottage Hospital, 5 in the Aged Blind Home, 6 in the Invalid Home, Aubert Park, 5 in the Metropolitan Benefit Asylum, 3 in the Invalid Home, Highbury Terrace, and 1 in the Dyers' Almshouses. There were also 8 deaths in the Holloway and Pentonville Prison Infirmaries. Without the Borough.—653 persons, of whom 405 were males and 248 females, residents of Islington, died in Institutions outside the Borough. Of these deaths 38 occurred in the North-Western Hospital, 1 in the Eastern Fever Hospital and 31 in the North-Eastern Hospital, all of which are under the control of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. In addition to these, 32 died in the University College Hospital, 11 in the Middlesex Hospital, 51 in the Children's Hospital, Great Ormonde Street, 4 in the Hospital for Women, Euston Road, 26 in the Metropolitan Hospital, n in the German Hospital, 68 in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 17 in the Chest Hospital, 33 in the Royal Free Hospital, 10 in the City of London Lying-in Hospital, 5 in the St. Pancras Infirmary, 2 in the St. Pancras Workhouse and 10 in the National Hospital, Queen's Square, and the remainder in the many institutions that are set out in table LXX. Within and without the Borough. Altogether the deaths of 1,581 persons belonging to Islington, out of the 4,955 persons who died and were properly credited to the Borough, or 31.9 per cent, occurred in Public Institutions situated either within or without the Borough. Accidental and Sudden Deaths without the Borough.—Thirtyone of these deaths occurred in the various London districts, and are set out in Table LXX.). The foregoing figures contrast with those of the ten preceding years as shown in the next table, and are of interest. 1905] 88 Table LXVII. Years. Total Deaths in Local Institutions cols. 3 and 4).

Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Entric (or Typhoid) Fever, Erysipelas, Puerperal Fever, Continued Fever, Relapsing Fever, Cholera. The number of cases notified during the year was 1,928, which is with one exception the smallest return recorded since the notification of the above mentioned diseases under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act became compulsory. It is 806 below the corrected average of the prec ding 10 years, and as it shows a decrease from each disease, with the exception of Puerperal Fever, which stood at its average (24), the record must be considered very satisfactory. It is all the more satisfactory because of the large decrease in the cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, the notifications from the former falling from an average of 1,412 to 1,198, and from the latter from 687 to 351. Indeed the return from Enteric Fever is not less remarkable, because the return shows that there has been a decrease from 235 to 100. In 1903 the return was very exceptional, only 1,707 cases having been reported, the decrease being due to the abnormally small return from Scarlet Fever. The 1,928 notifications represent an attack rate of 5.62 per 1,000 of the population, as against a rate of 7.00 for the County of London, and of 7.16 for the Encircling Boroughs, the returns for which are as follows :— Attack-Rates. St. Pancras 6.69 per 1,000 inhabitants. Stoke Newington 5.62 „ „ Hackney 8.44 „ „ Hornsey 1.57 „ „ Finsbury 7.58 „ „ Shoreditch 9.97 „ ,, The Encircling Boroughs 7.16 ,, „ County of London 7.00 „ „ Islington 5.62 „ „ 99 [1905 Here we see that with the exception of Hornsey, where the attack-rate was unusually, indeed, abnormally low, and of Stoke Newington, where the rate was identical with that of Islington, the ratio of cases per 1,000 of the inhabitants compared favourably with those of these Boroughs. The particulars respecting the various Metropolitan Boroughs are set out in tables CIII. and CIV. (pp. 127-128). The number of cases and the attack-rates for Islington for each year since 1891 are given below:— Years. Cases. Attack-rates. 1891 2,059 = 6.43 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1892 3,318 = 10.26 „ „ 1893 4,853 = 14.84 ,, ,, 1894 3,121 = 9.44 ,, ,, 1895 2,841 = 8.50 „ „ 1896 3,822 = 11.32,, ,, 1897 2,906 = 8.62 „ „ 1898 2,418 = 7.18 „ ,, 1899 2,943 = 8.75 ,, ,, 1900 2,276 = 6.78 ,, ,, 1901 2,852 = 8.50 ,, ,, 1902 3,164 = 9.20 ,, ,, 1903 1,707 = 5.03 1904 1,941 = 5.69 ,, ,, 1905 1,928 = 5 .62 „ „ Sub Registration Districts—The highest incidence of the infectious diseases fell on Islington South East, where the attack-rate was at the rate of 696 per 1,000 of the population, which was followed closely by Upper Holloway, where it was 6.01 per 1,000. In the other sub-registration districts the attack-rates were very level, varying only from 4.99 in Tufnell Ward to 5.30 in Barnsbury. The numbers for each sub-district are as follows: Cases. Attack-rates. Tufnell 168 4.99 per 1,000 inhabitants. Upper Holloway 214 6.01 ,, ,, Tollington 186 5.23 ,, ,, Lower Holloway 211 5.06 ,, ,, Highbury 332 5.00 ,, ,, Barnsbury 287 5.30 ,, ,, Islington South East 530 6.96 ,, ,, Total 1,928 5.62 ,, ,, H 2 100 1905] In the Wards the cases and attack-rates were as follows:— Cases. Attack-rates. Tufnell 168 4.99 per 1,000 inhabitants. Upper Holloway 214 6.01,, „ Tollington 186 5.23 ,, „ Lower Holloway 211 5.O6 ,, „ Highbury 195 5.57 , „ Mildmay 115 4.60 ,, „ Thornhill 171 5.11 ,, „ Barnsburv 116 5.62 ,, „ St. Mary 130 7.47 ,, ,, Canonbury 180 5.58 ,, ,, St. Peter 242 7.36 ,, „ In the Quarters.—In the First Quarter the number of cases notified was 392, which produced an annual attack-rate of 4*57 per 1,000 inhabitants. These were 180 below the corrected average (572) which obtained in the first quarters of the preceding ten years. In the County of London, during the same period, the attack-rate was 5.89 per t,ooo, or 1.32 higher than in Islington while in the Encircling Boroughs it was 6.11 per 1,000, or 1.54 higher than here. In the Second Quarter the cases numbered 396, which were equal to an annual attack-rate of 4.62 per 1,000 inhabitants. They were 166 less than the average (562) of the second quarter of the preceding ten years. During the same period the attack-rate in the County of London was 6.18 per 1,000, or 1.56 higher than in Islington, while in the Encircling Boroughs it was 6.30, or 1.68 above the rate of the Borough. In the Third Quarter there were 543 cases notified, or 204 less than the corrected average (747) which had been reported in the third quarters of the preceding ten years, and they produced an annual attack rate of 6.33 per 1,000. In this period the attack-rate in the County of London was 7.57 per 1,000, or 1.24 higher than locally, while in the Encircling Boroughs it was 8.64 per 1,000, or 2.31 higher than in Islington In the Fourth Quarter 596 cases were entered, or 258 below the average (854) of the ten preceding and corresponding quarters, and they produced an annual attack-rate of 6.95 per 1,000 inhabitants, while in the County of London 101 [1905 the rate was as high as 8.12 per 1,000, or 1.17 higher than that of the Borough, and in the Encircling Boroughs it was 9.48, or 2.53 above the Islington rate. Hospital Isolation.—Out of the 1,927 cases that were notified, 1,466, or 76.1 per cent, were removed to hospital for treatment, of whom 82, or 5.6 per cent, died, as against 5.4 per cent, of the cases that remained at home. This is the first occasion in recent years in which the home fatality was less than that of hospital. It, however, is due to the small home fatality arising from Erysipelas, which amounted to only 2.8 per cent. Fatality.—During the year 107 deaths occurred amongst the 1,927 cases which were notified, so that the fatality rate was 5.5 per cent., which is the lowest hitherto recorded. In the preceding year it had been 6.1 per cent., and in 1903 6.3 per cent., while the average since 1891 has been 8 6 per cent. The returns of previous years, as given below, show that there has been a steady diminution not only in the actual number of the notifications, but in the percentage proportion of the deaths to them. The particulars for these years are as follows :— Years. Cases. Deaths. Fatality. 1891 2,059 258 12.5 1892 3,318 291 8.7 1893 4,853 383 7 .9 1894 3,121 339 10.8 1895 2,841 266 9.3 1896 3,822 390 10.2 1897 2,906 258 8.8 1898 2,418 173 7.1 1899 2,943 238 8.1 1900 2,276 202 8.8 1901 2,852 250 8.7 1902 3,167 268 8.4 1903 1,707 108 6.3 1904 1,942 119 6.1 1905 1,927 107 5.5 Total 42,152 3,650 8.6 102 1905] SMALL POX. Only three cases of this disease were notified, of which one proved to be a mistaken diagnosis. They occurred in the first quarter among some Italians living at King's Cross. The return is the lowest since 1900 when 2 cases were notified, and is 42 less than the average of the preceding 10 years. In the County of London there were only 70 cases notified, of which 13 occurred in Camberwell and 13 in Stepney; 1 was known at Stoke Newington; 4 in Hackney; 2 in Paddington and 2 in Westminster. The other cases were notified from the Eastern and Southern districts. Table LXXII. Showing the Sickness from Small Pox in the Sub-Districts for each Quarter and for the Year.

This disease was notified in 1,198 instances, or in 214 less than the corrected average of the preceding 10 years. With the exception of the returns for 1903 and 1904 the present is the lowest hitherto recorded. The cases were equal to an attack-rate of 3.49, as compared with a mean attack-rate for 10 years of 4.12 It is also slightly less than the rate in the County of London, which was 4.17 per 1,000, and also less than that of the Encircling Boroughs, where the rate was 4.38 per 1,000. Hospital Isolation.—All the cases with the exception of 128, viz. 1,070, were removed to Hospital. These represent 89.3 per cent, of the notifications. Fatality.—37 cases, or 3 per cent, died, and of these 36, or 3.3 per cent, occurred in hospitals, while out of 128 cases treated at home only 1, or 07 per cent., were fatal. Table LXXV.

Diphtheria, inclusive of Membranous Croup, caused 351 notifications to be made, as against an average of 700 during the preceding 10 years, so that there was a decrease of 349. This, coming on the low records of 1903, when 458 were notified, and of 1904, when 347 were reported, is extremely satisfactory, for it shows that the disease is by no means as prevalent as it was a few years ago. The present return is the lowest with one exception hitherto recorded, and is only 4 above that of 1904. The attack-rate was equal to 1.02 per 1,000 of the inhabitants and is nearly 1.02 per 1,000 of the mean rate of the preceding 10 years. In the County of London the rate was 1.37 per 1,000 and in the Encircling Boroughs 1.34 per 1,000, from which it is seen that the Islington record is very good. Hospital Isolation.—Out of 351 cases notified, 281, or 80 per cent., were isolated in hospital for treatment, and of these 26 or 9.2 died. Fatality.—34 cases died, so that the fatality was 97 per cent. The percentage fatality of the cases treated in hospital was 9.2 as against 11.4 that were nursed at home. In table LXXXIII. the cases and deaths at each year of life up to 15 are given and from that age in periods of 10 years. There it will be seen that the greatest number of cases and deaths occurred amongst children under 8 years old, beyond which period of life the disease is comparatively harmless, only 1 death being registered amongst 116 persons attacked.

RED LINES—WEEKLY NOTIFICATIONS. GREEN LINES-TEN YEARS' AVERAGE. 111 [1905 ENTERIC FEVER. The return from Enteric Fever was exceedingly good and was the lowest hitherto recorded in Islington. The cases numbered 100, as compared with an average of 235 in the preceding 10 years. These were equal to an annual attack rate of 0.29, as against a rate of 0.6g in the preceding decennial period. In the County of London the attack rate was 0.33 per 1,000, and in the Encircling Boroughs 0.40, from which figures it is seen that Islington occupied a very favourable position. Hospital Isolation.—71 cases, equal to 70 per cent, of the total number notified, were removed to hospital for treatment and isolation. Fatality.—Out of the 100 cases, 17, or 17 per cent, proved fatal. Of the 71 cases treated in hospital 11, or 15.5 per cent. died, while of the 29 cases treated at home 6, or 20.7 per cent. died.

Erysipelas was responsible for 252 cases or 61 less than the average of 313 which obtained during the preceding decennium. The return is with one exception the lowest recorded since the notification of the disease was made compulsory. These cases represent an attack-rate of 0.74 per 1,000 of the population as against a mean rate of 0.91 in the 10 years 1895-1904; in the County of London of 106, and in the Encircling Boroughs 0.99. Hospital Isolation—Very few cases are usually removed to hospital; and last year was no exception to the rule, for only 38 were treated in the medical institutions, while 214 were nursed at home. Of the hospital cases 6, or 15.8 per cent. died, while amongst those treated at home there were 6 deaths, or 2.8 per cent. Table LXXXVII.

During the year 81 cases of Phthisis were notified by medical practitioners in Islington, of which 13 were forwarded by men holding public positions. In addition to these, 42 cases came under observation through the kindness of the Relieving Officers, so that altogether 123 cases came to the knowledge of the Public Health Department. It must be confessed that the number of notifications received from medical men is somewhat disappointing. Nevertheless, as there is no compulsion, we must be thankful for even the number that has been notified. In every instance enquiries were made at the home, and the following paper containing hints for the prevention of consumption was left with the invalids or with their parents or guardians. PRECAUTIONS RECOMMENDED FOR ADOPTION BY CONSUMPTIVE PERSONS. CONSUMPTION is an INFECTIOUS and PREVENTABLE ailment, and it is generally spread by inhaling the spit or expectoration, which contains the germs of the disease, of a person suffering from consumption. The following precautions are, therefore, recommended to be adopted by consumptives:— 1.—Expectoration indoors should be received into a cup or pocket spittoon, or into pieces of paper that can be at once burnt. 2.—Expectoration out of doors should be received into pieces of rag, or paper handkerchiefs, which can be burnt, or into a pocket spittoon, but spitting on the footpaths should on no account be practised. 3.—The contents of the spittoon or cup should be poured down the water closet, and the spittoon or cup should be then disinfected by filling it with boiling water, and afterwards washing it in a disinfectant. K 1905] 130 4.—Handkerchiefs or any clothing which may have become splashed with the spit, mucous, or expectoration, should be disinfected by boiling in water, or by soaking in a disinfectant. 5.—Kissing should never be practised, because there is a great possibility that the germs of the disease may be carried from lips to lips. 6.—A baby should never be suckled by a mother suffering from consumption. 7.—Clothing, towels, sponges, bedding, etc., should not be used in common by consumptives and healthy people. Consumptives should have special articles for their own use. 8.—Special feeding utensils, such as cups, saucers, plates, knives, forks, spoons, should be provided for consumptives, and should not be used by any other persons until they have first been boiled in water. 9.—A consumptive who smokes must not allow another person to use his tobacco pipe. 10.—When coughing, a consumptive should hold a handkerchief, or rag, or piece of paper before his mouth, and should never cough in the direction of another person, because even the fine spray emitted in the act is laden with germs. 11.—Rooms used by consumptives should always be cleansed with tea leaves and wet dusters, to prevent the dust, which may contain disease germs, rising. The tea leaves should be immediately destroyed, and the dusters boiled. 12.—Allow as much sunshine and fresh air into the rooms as possible. Sunshine destroys the disease germs, while fresh, pure air inhaled into the lungs has a similar tendency. Consequently consumptives, should, as far as possible, live in the open air, and sleep in rooms with open chimneys and open windows, top and bottom, avoiding draughts. The greatest gainer by the adoption of the above precautions is the patient himself, because his recovery is retarded, and sometimes prevented, by renewed infection derived from his own expectoration. 131 [1905 It should also be mentioned every week an extract is made from the mortality returns of the deaths that have occurred from phthisis, and in each instance the following letter is sent by the Medical Officer of Health to the head of the family :— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON. Town Hall, Upper Street, N. Dear Sir or Madam, I exceedingly regret to find from the Mortality Returns that a member of your household has died from consumption of the lungs. This disease, as you are probably aware, is infectious, and consequently the rooms which the patient has occupied, as well as the clothing which has been worn, have in all probability become infected. Under these circumstances you will recognise that it is necessary that the rooms and the clothing should be disinfected in order that the disease may not be conveyed to other persons. I have, therefore, to ask that you will be good enough to assist the Sanitary Authority in its endeavour to stamp out consumption by allowing such disinfection, for which of course there will be no charge, to be carried out. If you will kindly inform the Inspector who calls with this letter when it will be convenient for the Disinfector to commence his work, I will make the necessary arrangements for its speedy completion. All the bedding and clothing used by the deceased will be removed to the Borough Disinfecting Station for disinfection and will be returned within twenty-four hours. I am, Yours faithfully, A. E. HARRIS, Medical Officer of Health. As a rule the offer is gratefully accepted and consequently it happens that in 283 cases the room and clothing were disinfected. K 2 1905] 132 INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. Notifiable Diseases.—Among the 1,927 cases of the notifiable infectious diseases, it was found that 832 children were in attendance at one or other of the Public Elementary Schools, and that 509 cases occurred in houses from which children attended similar institutions. The proportion of school children suffering from those diseases to every 100 cases notified was 43.2, while the proportion of non-scholars who lived in the same houses with scholars was 26.4 per cent. An examination of the returns shows that the scholars who had been attacked suffered from the following diseases :— Scarlet Fever 640 Diphtheria 138 Enteric Fever 31 Other notifiable diseases 23 Total 832 The non-scholars who lived in houses from which scholars attended school were notified as suffering from :— Scarlet Fever 206 Diphtheria 131 Enteric Fever 60 Other Fevers 112 Total 509 In all these cases the children attending school were kept at home until the premises and clothing had been thoroughly disinfected, and afterwards until sufficient time had elapsed to make certain that they themselves had not contracted the disease. The figures since 1896, showing the number of scholars who have been annually attacked are sub-joined. 183 [1905 Small Pox. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. Other Diseases.

The disease, however, as proved by the fatality, was of a very slight character. Small Pox.—No case occurred among scholars attending any of the Public Elementary Schools. Scarlet Fever.—This disease attacked 640 scholars, as against an average of 657 during the preceding 9 years. In only one school (Popham Road) could the cases be said to have been excessive, wherein 40 occurred. In no other school was the number more than 26, which was the number recorded in Queen's Head Street, in St. Mary's, 24, Ecclesbourne Road 20, and Holy Trinity 20. In the other Public Elementary Schools the cases ranged from 1 in St. John's, Conewood Street and St. Jude's and St. James' to 19 in Buckingham Street and Duncombe Road Schools. There was no case in St. Matthew's, City Road. In addition to these cases 206 were known in the homes of children in attendance at school. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—Only 138 cases, the exact number of the preceding year, were known among scholars, as against an average of 281 in the preceding 9 years. This is a most satisfactory and welcome decrease in a disease which is very fatal in the early years of life. The largest number known in an, one school did not exceed 11, and these occurred at Grafton Road County Council School. At Hornsey Road School 10 cases occurred, but in no other did the number exceed 6. Indeed in 9 of 184 1906] the elementary schools no case of the disease was known. This absence of disease is particularly noteworthy in a large school like that of Gillespie Road. The cases amongst scholars formed 39.3 per cent of the cases of Diphtheria that were notified. There were also 131 cases notified from houses in which scholars lived. Enteric Fever.—31 cases occurred among scholars, but these cases were distributed in 16 schools. Other fevers, among which is Erysipelas, attacked 23 scholars in attendance at 15 London County Council Schools, while 112 cases were known in houses wherein scholars lived. Non-Notifiable Infectious Diseases.—During the year the Teachers of the Public Elementary Schools notified no less than 3,379 cases of Measles, Chicken Pox, Whooping Cough and the other diseases, such as Mumps, Ringworm, etc., to the Medical Officer of Health, as ordered by the London County Council School Code. In no previous year has such a large return been made by the teachers, which no doubt is accounted for by the fact that greater activity in the Medical Department of the Educational Committee of the County Council now prevails than was formerly the case under the School Board for London. Indeed, unstinted praise must be given for the greater zeal displayed by the teachers in affording information, although it must be admitted that in some of the schools there are some teachers still, who, either through ignorance of the rules or want of appreciation of the benefit likely to accrue to their scholars from prompt notification to the Medical Officer of Health, do not afford the early information respecting these diseases that is so essential if they are to be stopped from spreading among the scholars. Measles.—999 cases of Measles were notified by the teachers, as against 355 cases in the preceding year. Of these, 103 occurred in Canonbury Road School, 112 in Montem Street School, 78 in the Forster School, Hornsey Road, 74 in Upper Hornsey Road School, 54 in Ecclesbourne Road School, and 53 in Poole's Park School. The great majority of these cases occurred in the Infants' Departments, and particularly in the class rooms where the youngest children were taught. 135 [1905 There can be no doubt that school attendance is a fruitful cause of the spread of Measles, and it has not yet been practically settled how best to deal with it. It has already been pointed out in this report that Dr. Kerr, of the Education Department of the London County Council, has been investigating this matter in Woolwich, and that it is hoped that before long some practical method available for the whole County of London may be discovered. It is said that if the disease is to be prevented, the class-room in which the cases have appeared should be closed as soon as two or three have occurred, but that before doing this due consideration should be given to the number of scholars in the class-room who have already had the disease, and are therefore protected from further attacks. In order to obtain this information it will be necessary for the London County Council to order their teachers to present a periodical return of these scholars to the Medical Officers of Health of the various Boroughs, so that they may consider the advisability or otherwise of closing the school or class-rooms, for without this knowledge it will be impossible for him to come to a proper conclusion. It will not be sufficient for the Medical Officer of the Education Department to alone receive this information, for then it is apparent that he would be in a better position than the Medical Officer of Health to judge of the necessity of closing the school, which, of course, would be an intolerable position for those officers who alone are responsible for the state of health of their district. It is very doubtful if this information can be obtained, and if obtained, that it would be accurate, and if inaccurate it would be more than useless, for it would be misleading. In Islington the schools have been very closely watched, and it must be confessed that in several schools which were not closed when a few cases of measles had occurred, the disease has not spread, and, therefore, the question arises whether or not a grave injustice would have been done to the schools by the closure of these class-rooms immediately these few cases were known. On the other hand, there are schools where the class-rooms were not closed when a few cases occurred, and where subsequently a considerable number of cases followed. In dealing with this matter, one cannot dismiss from his mind the responsibility that is incurred in prematurely closing a school or a class room, because of the seriousness of the matter, both for the scholars, the teachers 1905] 136 and the parents, especially the mothers, to whom the schools are really a place of safety for their youngest children during the day while they are away earning their daily bread. This subject is being very carefully considered by the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough, who is most anxious to do nothing hastily that might cause injury either to the scholars or the schools. Chicken Pox.—637 cases were notified by the teachers, as compared with 182 in the preceding year, so that here again there has been very laudable zeal shown by them. In Yerbury Road School as many as 54 cases were known, in Canonbury Road School 37, in Hungerford Road School 36, in Upper Hornsey Road School 33, in Buckingham Street School 30, and in other schools the cases notified ranged from nothing in 4 schools to 20. Whooping Cough.—There is no doubt that not nearly so many cases of this disease occurred in the Borough during the year, for the teachers notified only 732 as against 1,293 in 1904. The disease seems to have been more prevalent in Yerbury Road School than in the others, for from it were reported 71 cases. It is noticeable with respect to this school that in the preceding year there was also a very large number reported by its teachers, indeed, as many as 107 cases The other schools in which the disease was most prevalent, and the cases occurring in them, were as follows:— Montem Street School, 54; Duncombe Road School, 49; Gillespie Road School, 42; Westbourne Road School, 34; St. Thomas School, 36 ; Grafton Road School, 39; Caledonian Road School, 39; and Upper Hornsey Road School, 33. No cases were notified from 10 schools. Mumps and other Diseases.—As many as 1,011 cases were notified. These include mumps and other diseases which can hardly be rightly classed as "epidemic," although they may be said to be "infectious," such a disease as Itch and some other parasitic diseases with which the present schools management seem very anxious to deal. Once more, the Medical Officer of Health, as Head of the Public Health Department, wishes to express his sincere and grateful thanks for the valuable assistance he has received from the school authorities and teachers in his endeavour to deal with the infectious disease occuring among the scholars. 187 [1905 TABLE CV.

No less than 1,466 out of 1,927 cases, or 76.1 per cent., were removed to hospital for isolation and treatment during 1905, as compared with 75.5 per cent. in 1904 and 72.6 in 1903. Indeed, the proportion of isolated cases has risen from 48.4 per cent, in 1896, to 76.1 in 1905 so that practically at present only the very mildest cases, which for the most part are Erysipelas, remain at home. Practically all the cases of Scarlet Fever, viz. 89.3 per cent., were taken away, while as many 80 per cent, of the patients suffering from Diphtheria were also removed to hospital. This figure is closely followed by Enteric Fever, of which 71 per cent, of the cases were isolated. The extraordinary willingness and, indeed, anxiety of the parents and guardians of the patients to have them removed is one of the signs of the times, and seems to show that the public at large are now imbued with a strong desire to protect themselves and the public. Evidently sanitary education has been slowly permeating the masses. The return of the cases isolated during the preceding 9 years is as follows:— 1896 48.4 per cent. 1901 69.6 per cent. 1897 55.7 „ 1902 71.9 „ 1898 58.4 „ 1903 72.6 „ 1899 64.6 „ 1904 75.5 „ 1900 68.2 „ 1905 76.1 „ Small Pox.—Each of the two cases were removed to hospital. One death occurred in hospital, or 50.0 per cent of those isolated. Scarlet Fever.—No less than 1,070 out of 1,198 known cases, or 89.3 per cent., were removed to hospital, of which 36, or 33 per cent., died. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—281 out of 351 cases, or 80.0 per cent, were isolated in hospital, of which 26, or 9.2 per cent., died. Enteric Fever.—100 persons were attacked, of whom 71, or 71.0 per cent., were received into hospital. Of these 11 died, or 15.5 per cent. The Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals received the great majority of these cases, the particulars of which are set out in the following table. 1905] 140 Table CVII.

It has been the custom of the Medical Officer of Health for twenty years to draw attention to the nature of the trades and business premises on which infectious diseases have occurred during each year, because he thinks it is of the greatest advantage to the public to understand that the removal of persons suffering from them is most useful not only as a means for the prevention of the spread of these diseases among the people living in the same houses, but also prevents them spreading to the public, as well as the possible closure of the premises in which the diseases have occurred. Scarlet Fever.—During the year under survey, 143 cases of Scarlet Fever were discovered on business premises, on which were carried on the following trades, among others:—Artificial Flower-making, Box-making, Blouse-making, Boot-making, Bread and Cake making, Costume-making, Cabinet-making, Feather Cleaning, Laundry Work, Milk Selling, General Dealing, Greengrocery, Grocery and Hairdressing. It need not be pointed out that if the articles made or sold at these premises had become infected, very serious results would have accrued to the public. Diphtheria.—Diphtheria was noted in 28 premises, in 4 of which the business of General Dealing was conducted, and in 2 that of selling milk, and in 2 that of selling sweets. 148 [1905 Table CIX.

During the last 7½ years the late Vestry and the present Borough Council have made examinations of specimens of mucous and blood from cases of Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Phthisis for medical practitioners, and although this has been done gratuitously, it cannot be said that the number examined annually has been very numerous, for while there were 252 in the first year there were only 274 during 1904. In 1905, however, this number increased to 421. There is, therefore, some hope that the medical men engaged in practice in the Borough are appreciating more highly than before the value of these diagnoses, which enable them to identify these diseases when they are in doubt. It is not desired that it should be understood that all the profession have been indifferent to the offer placed at their disposal, for this is not the case, as a great many have frequently expressed their appreciation of it to the Medical Officer of Health and have freely availed themselves of it. Diphtheria.—147 specimens were examined, and of these 61 gave positive results and 86 negative. This is the largest number hitherto examined in any one year. Enteric Fever.—56 specimens of blood were tested, with the result that 34 indicated the presence of the disease, while 22 gave negative results. Phthisis.—As many as 218 specimens of mucous were examined, as compared with 135 in the preceding year and 136 in 1903. This increase in the number of examinations indicates that the profession are taking more active interest in the great question of the prevention and cure of phthisis, which can only be accomplished with anything like certainty if the disease is detected in its earliest stages. Of the specimens examined, the baccilli of Tuberculosis were found in 87, while in 131 they could not be detected. M 2 164 1905] Since 1897, 2282 examinations have been made for the medical profession, of which 836 were mucous taken from the throats of Diphtheritic patients, 603 were blood from Enteric Fever patients, and 840 mucous from the lungs of Phthisical patients. The results of these examinations are set out in the table below:— Diseases. Total Examinations. Positive Results. Negative Results. Percentage of Positive Results.

The good repute which Islington once held for its vaccination state seems to be steadily returning, notwithstanding the gross misrepresentations of anti-vaccinators and others who are more or less ignorant of the wonderful effects it has had in preventing one of the vilest diseases that ever afflicted mankind, for the complete returns for 1904 show that the percentage of children, less those who have died un-vaccinated, has now reached 82.3, which is the highest figure attained since 1894, when it stood at 84.0, from which year the percentage has fallen until it reached low water mark in 1898, when 66.9 per cent only were vaccinated. The recent return shows that Islingtonians at all events have not been carried away by the wiles and sophistries of these persons, who seem to think that the greatest consummation to be desired in this world is to do away with vaccination and to allow the population to become unprotected against Small Pox. The number of persons who applied for exemption certificates from vaccination for their children numbered only 89, as against 6,774 children who were successfully vaccinated. For this success credit must be given to Messrs. Butcher and Hughes, the Vaccination Officers, who seem to have worked most diligently, and, as the return shows, successfully. The several tabular statements which are herewith appended deserve careful study. It is not proposed to labour this subject, as no good purpose can be served thereby, particularly as it is almost futile to attempt to convince an antivaccinator that he is wrong in the opinion he holds respecting vaccination, for it is almost impossible to make him understand the error of his ways. Nevertheless, it may be added that the writer has known several of its opponents in the course of his long experience in public health and hospital work who have been convinced of its efficacy, but only by the hard logic of affliction. He, however, sincerely trusts that it may not be their fate, as it has been of others whom he knows, to bewail too late the catastrophe that has overtaken themselves and their families. 167 [1905 Years.

Towards the end of the year three letters were received from the Boroughs of Salford, Bermondsey and Lambeth on the following subjects :— 1. To the increased cost of vaccination. 2. To the desirability of the practice of vaccination being controlled by Public Health Authorities instead of by Board of Guardians. 3. To the appointment in large towns of a Medical Vaccination Officer at a fixed salary, who shall give his whole time to the duties of vaccination. First, with respect to the cost of vaccination. The Increased Cost of Vaccination.—The Town Council of Salford in bringing this matter under your notice, say that they are of opinion that the cost of vaccination under the present Act has been unnecessarily heavy, and that in any further legislation it would urge that the scale of remuneration should be modified; and the Borough Council of Bermondsey support this view. Now, in order to see how far their contention is correct, it will be necessary first to enquire into the nature of the duties cast upon the Public Vaccinators under the Vaccination Act of 1867 and under the Vaccination Act of 1898 before a just conclusion can be arrived at, because it is not a fair or just criterion to merely compare figures without also taking into consideration the relative amount of work that the Acts and Regulations made under them impose on the officers appointed to execute them, and also surveying the advantages that have accrued to the infants, parents and guardians under the Act of 1898. Under the Act ot 1867 Vaccination was performed at appointed stations, as this law enacted that the Guardians "shall provide all stations at " which vaccination shall be appointed to be performed other than the surgery "or residence of the Public Vaccinator." To those Stations the infants were brought on stated days and hours, ana arm to arm vaccination was freely, almost entirely, practised. 171 [1905 The fees ordered to be paid for successful primary vaccination to the Public Vaccinator were laid down in section 6 of the Act, and were on the following scale:— If the station were within a mile of the Doctor's residence, not less than one shilling and sixpence. If the station were over 1 mile and less than 2 miles, not less than two shillings. If the station were over 2 miles and less than 3 miles, not less than three shillings. In London this practically meant that the Public Vaccinators were paid at the rate of one shilling and sixpence per successful vaccination. In addition to these fees, they were also entitled to a fee in respect of every case of successful re-vaccination, amounting to two-thirds of the amount payable upon each case of successful primary vaccination. From these Regulations we see:— 1. That the Guardians had to provide stations for vaccination. 2. That the infants were brought to these Stations to be vaccinated. 3. That the Public Vaccinators had not to travel more than a short distance in going to their Stations. 4. That arm to arm vaccination was almost universally practised. 5. That the fee in London was practically fixed at one shilling and sixpence. The Act of 1898 abolished vaccination at Stations, for reasons to be seen later on, and on the 16th September, 1898, the Local Government Board sent a circular letter to the Clerks of the Guardians, pointing out that " under the new arrangements for public vaccination contemplated by the Vaccination Act, 1898, the use of Stations at which public vaccination has hitherto been performed will be discontinued at the end of the year, except in those cases where under section 7 of the Act, the Board deem it expedient by reason of serious risk of outbreak of Smallpox or other exceptional circumstances to require the Guardians to provide Vaccination Stations." 172 1905] The Stations being abolished, the Act decreed by sections 1 (2) that the Public Vaccinator shall visit the home of the child if the parent or other person having its custody so requires for the purpose of vaccinating it; and in the succeeding sub-section (3) that if a child is not vaccinated within four months after its birth, the Public Vaccinator shall visit its home and shall offer to vaccinate with glycerinated calf lymph. He, however, is not to vaccinate the child if the home is such that the child cannot be safely vaccinated, or if there is, or has been, a recent prevalence of infectious disease. When he has vaccinated the infant, he will be obliged to call at the house a second time, not less than six days nor more than fourteen days after the operation, to see if the vaccination has been successful. If after the operation the child requires medical treatment, he shall attend the child, if the parents or guardians consent, and prescribe such treatment as may be necessary. Thus the Public Vaccinator must attend the child at least twice, and may have to attend oftener, generally taking one case with another, about four times. For these services the Act prescribes :— 1. A birth Fee of not less than one shilling for every birth in his district. 2. A payment of not less than five shillings in respect of every successful primary vaccination or re-vaccination performed at the home of the person vaccinated. 3. A payment of not less than two shillings and sixpence in respect of every successful primary vaccination of any person other than a child, or of any successful re-vaccination performed by him at his surgery or elsewhere than at the home of the person vaccinated. Such professional fees must be considered reasonable for such services and responsible work, which there is every reason to believe is carried out in Islington most conscientiously and with the greatest care. The increased payment is more than compensated for by the advantages resulting to parents and children from the abolition of the vaccination stations and the substitution therefor of home vaccination. 1. Parents are saved the trouble of taking their children twice to a station, first for the operation itself, and secondly to enable the Public Vaccinator to inspect the results and give a certificate of successful vaccination. 173 [1905 2. Their children will be saved the risk of colds through being taken out in bad weather, also the risk of catching an infectious disease from other children with whom they may be brought into contact at the Station. 3. The Public Vaccinator will be able to see the state of the child's home, and if it is in a very insanitary condition, he may postpone the operation ; so, also, if he finds there has been lately any infectious disease there or in the neighbourhood. 4. Under the new system in which glycerinated calf lymph is employed, it will not be necessary to open, for the purpose of vaccinating other children, the vaccination vesicles which have formed on a child's arm. There will thus be less risk of injury to the child from dirt which might get in at the place of opening. With these benefits in view, as well as the increased work thrown on the Public Vaccinator, it is not too much to say that the actual amount paid per operation is not too high, but on the whole is reasonable and fair. The question of the increased cost of vaccination has been raised by three Borough Councils. The Bermondsey Borough Council, however, give no figures, contenting themselves by saying that the cost under the present Act has been unnecessarily heavy, while Lambeth points out that the cost has risen from an average of 5s. yd. per vaccination in the three years preceding the Vaccination Act of 1898 coming into force, to 9s. 3d. during the following three years, and during the last two years, which may be considered normal years, to 8s. to 8s. The Salford Council content themselves with giving the following figures:— Number Vaccinated. Number Re-vaccinated. Cost. £ s. d. 1900 2578 2 1404 5 4 1901 2680 15 1393 13 2 1902 2964 12 1394 4 11 1903 5123 1805 2396 0 7 1904 6018 10781 4078 16 0 1905 4879 1920 2280 19 1 24242 14535 £12947 19 1 174 1905] These gross figures show that the average cost of each vaccination in Salford during these six years has been 6s. 8d. From these figures the average cost for each year has been worked out, and it is found that whereas the cost in 1900 in Salford was 10s. 10½d. it had fallen in 1905 to 6s. 8£d., an amount which, as it presumably includes the remuneration to the Vaccination Officers, cannot be said to be unreasonable, especially when the minimum fees laid down by the Act of 1898 are recollected. The figures for each year are as follows :— 1900 10s. 10½d. per vaccination. 1901 10s. 4d. „ 1902 9s. 4½d. „ 1903 6s. 11d. „ 1904 4s. 10d. „ 1905 6s. 8½d. „ Cost of Vaccination in Islington. In Islington it appears from a return kindly prepared by Mr. Edwin Davey, the Clerk to the Guardians, that in the same years as stated for Salford the average cost of each vaccination has been 6s. 6½d., or 1½d. less than in that town. Such a close approximation of the average fees to each other shows that the two Boards of Guardians evidently administered the law on the same lines. As in Salford, so in Islington also has there been a variation in the average cost per case, for while it was 9s. 5d. in 1900, it had fallen to 7s. 1d. in 1905. The lowest average cost occured in 1902, when 14,896 adults, in addition to the ordinary infantile vaccinations were re-vaccinated. This circumstance resulted in the reduction of the average cost of each vaccination because a lesser fee is paid for a re-vaccination, the operation generally being performed at the doctor's surgery, and not at the individual's house. A similar low average, 4s. 10d. per vaccination, occurred in Salford in 1904, when 10,781 persons were re-vaccinated. With reference to the Lambeth comparison as to the cost of vaccination, before and after the passing of the Vaccination Act of 1898, it is found that it contrasts with Islington as follows :— Average cost in Lambeth per vaccination in the three years prior to Act, 5s. 7d. Average cost in Islington per vaccination in the three years prior to Act, 5s. 4d. 175 [1905 Average cost per vaccination in Lambeth in the three years after the Act, 9s. 3d. Average cost per vaccination in Islington in the three years after the Act, 8s. 5d. The Lambeth Council also calls attention to the fact that whereas only 8,231 vaccinations took place when the cost was 5s. 7d. per case, as many as 12,035 took place when the cost was gs. 3d. It is not known what inference is intended to be deducted from this observation, but it might be pointed out that it was a well-known fact that prior to the Act of 1898 becoming law, many thousand persons throughout the United Kingdom put off the vaccination of their children in the hope that it might contain some loophole to enable them to escape the obligations of the Act then in force. We all know as a matter of fact that the new Act did contain a clause which relieved persons holding a conscientious objection to vaccination from their obligations. When, however, it was seen that this relief could only be obtained at some little trouble, the great mass of defaulters under the old Act had their children operated on, and consequently the returns largely increased. The fact also that under the new Act the child was visited at the parents' or guardians' house, and that consequently the inconvenience and trouble of attending at the Vaccination Station was thereby avoided, was another and not inconsiderable factor in promoting vaccination. The Lambeth Borough Council makes the statement that "the fact of domicilary visits is not sufficient to account for the great increase in cost, seeing that the Public Vaccinators in a district like Lambeth, which is densely populated, can perform as many vaccinations in one day under the new conditions as they could under the old conditions of Stational Vaccination." On the face of it this statement is incorrect, for it is manifestly impossible for any Vaccinator to vaccinate as quickly with glycerinated calf lymph as it is from arm to arm. Besides there is the sterilization of the instruments, the protection of the newly performed vaccination with a shield, as well as the journey from place to place to be taken into account. It would be safe to assert that any practitioner could easily perform half-a-dozen operations at a station in the time it would take him to perform one under the new law. 176 1905] When all these circumstances are considered, it cannot be said that the present cost of vaccination under the conditions laid down by the Act is excessive. The desirability of the practice of Vaccination being controlled by Public Health Authorities instead of by Boards of Guardians. It may be said to be an anomaly that the authorities appointed under the Public Health Acts to deal with infectious disease do not possess the administration of all the laws relating to their prevention. Strange, however, as it may appear they do not possess this power in one most glaring instance, namely in the administration of the Vaccination Laws, on whose proper enforcement the health of the people so far as it relates to Small Pox is dependent, for undoubtedly Vaccination is the great preventive of this disease. Nevertheless, to those who are acquainted with the history of the vaccination laws this is not a surprise. The first Vaccination Act was passed on July 23rd, 1840, and by it the Guardians and Overseers of every Parish and Union in England and Wales were directed to contract with their Medical Officers or with any legally qualified practitioner for the vaccination of persons within their district. At this time no Sanitary Authorities, such as we know them now, existed, whereas there were authorities ready to hand and fully equipped with a medical staff who were quite competent to execute the Acts. Consequently they were appointed for the purpose. In the following year (1841) a supplementary act was passed, which charged the expenses on the Poor Rates, but which also enacted that vaccination or surgical or medical assistance incident to vaccination should not be considered parochial relief, and it also abolished the practice of inoculation. In 1853 an Act to make compulsory the practice of vaccination was passed. These Acts were repealed in 1867 by the Consolidation Act. The Government control of the administration of these laws was at first (1848) in the hands of a Board called the Board of Health, but in 1858 an Act entitled the Public Health Act, 1858, vested in the Privy Council certain Powers for the Protection of the Public Health, among which were powers relating to the administration of the vaccination laws, which they supervised through their medical officers. 177 [1905 The Privy Council exercised jurisdiction until they were superseded by the Local Government Board, who were appointed by the Local Government Act of 1876, since which date this Board has supervised vaccinations. Thus it has happened that the local administration of the vaccination laws has remained in the hands of the Boards of Guardians. Now, however, things are changed, as under, various Public Health Acts there have grown up authorities whose main duty is to protect the health of the people. It goes without saying that if these authorities had existed in the early days of vaccination, they would have been appointed to enforce the laws relating to it. At present, however, a change is not altogether easy, although it has been foreshadowed recently, and it might be expensive, because it would mean compensation to the Vaccination Officers and Public Vaccinators throughout the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, the writer has always considered that the Public Health Authorities should be the administrators of the vaccination laws, because they are the natural guardians of the public against infectious diseases, and, therefore, they should possess the command of all the means whereby these diseases can be prevented. This is particularly necessary when Small Pox is epidemic, because in putting a period to the outbreak a great deal depends at such a time on the action or inaction of the Board of Guardians, to whom the safe-guarding of the public health does not appeal so forcibly as to the authority specially appointed for the purpose. At such times the difference of opinion as to the steps necessary to be taken with respect to vaccination is apt to cause serious harm and, indeed, such difficulties have occured before now between the two bodies, with results unfavourable to the public welfare. On careful consideration of this matter, no sufficiently strong reason can be alleged why the administration of the vaccination laws should not be placed in the hands of the public health authorities, while on the other hand both reason and common sense indicate that they should possess them. The appointment in large towns of a Medical Vaccination Officer at a fixed salary, who shall give the whole of his time to the duty. There can be no doubt that if Sanitary Authorities were given the administration of the Vaccination Acts the work could be done at a lesser cost, and just as well as at present, by one or more specially appointed officers, devoting the whole of their time to their duties, and paid a fixed salary. The matter requires no argument, particularly as in all vhe largest towns there would be sufficient work for at least one officer, if not more. N 178 1905] DISINFECTION. Under this heading is included the disinfection as well as the cleansing and stripping of rooms, the disinfection of schools, and the disinfection of articles of clothing and household bedding which have become infected by an epidemic disease. Disinfection of Rooms.—As many as 2,393 rooms were disinfected, as compared with 2,195 in the preceding year, after the occurrence of one of the epidemic diseases. As in 1904, the disinfectant that has been employed has been formaldehyde, used either in the form of vapour or as a solution. It is satisfactory to be able to again report that the disinfection has been most successful, and that no persons have become infected through any failure of its disinfecting powers. Cleansing and Stripping of Rooms.—552 rooms were cleansed and stripped during the year, compared with 392 in 1904. This increase was chiefly due to the fact that the number of rooms in which, so to speak, the papers through their multiplicity, kept up the walls, were more than usual. It is always inadvisable where the paper is much damaged, even after the most thorough disinfection, to refrain from stripping the walls. It might be said that in consequence of the adoption of disinfection by formaldehyde very considerable savings have been effected in the Public Health Department, so that the wages of disinfectors have fallen from £795 in 1900 per annum to £254 in 1905. Disinfection of Schools—In consequence of the presence of Measles, class rooms in the following schools were disinfected. DISINFECTION. Schools Disinfected:— 1st Quarter. Gillespie Road. 2nd Quarter.

The work of disinfection was done well and expeditiously, and the disinfected articles have been invariably returned home the same day as they were received. n 2 180 1905] The sub-joined table gives a summary of the chief articles of clothing and bedding, etc., disinfected during the past two years.

The Council adopted their report and applied to the Local Government Board for permission to borrow the money. The Board, however, decided that the money could not be obtained under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, and, therefore, did not give their sanction to the scheme. The matter at present stands in abeyance, but as the accommodation is much required it should be proceeded with quickly, and paid for, if necessary, out of current expenditure. The following is the report presented by the Medical Officer of Health on the subject:— 183 [1905 To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, PROVISION OF ACCOMMODATION FOR DISINFECTING VERMINOUS PERSONS AND CLOTHING, and PROVISION OF ACCOMMODATION FOR DISINFECTING NURSES AFTER ATTENDANCE ON PUERPERAL FEVER CASES. You will be aware that the Council possess a Disinfecting station and Shelter House, which have an entrance from Seven Sisters Road and are situate immediately behind the Hornsey Road Baths. These places were erected in order to meet the needs of the district and to comply with the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Shelter House has been used on ordinary occasions only sparsely, but when an outbreak of Small Pox arises, or when there is a large amount of Scarlet Fever, or of any disease of such a serious nature that the walls of the premises require to be stripped, it is used to its utmost capacity. This was particularly so during the Small Pox outbreak, when the four suites of rooms were hardly ever unoccupied. You are aware that in 1897 the legislature passed the Cleansing of Persons Act, which practically consists of one section and which provides that on and after the passing of the Act the Local Authority shall have the power to permit any person who shall apply to them, on the ground that he is infected with vermin, to have the use, free of charge, of the apparatus which the Authority possess for cleansing his person and his clothing from vermin. When this Act was passed, an arrangement was made to cleanse the person and clothing of any person who applied at the Disinfecting Station and Shelter House. The London County Council General Powers Act, 1904, has carried the law, so far as it relates to London, with respect to vermin a stage farther, for under part 4, section 19, of that Act, the Sanitary Authority are empowered to disinfect any articles in a house in their district which are in a filthy, dangerous or unwholesome condition, by reason of which health is affected or endangered, or where the cleansing or purifying or destroying of such articles is requisite to prevent or to check infectious disease. In section 20 the Sanitary Authority is required, where it is found that any house or part thereof is infested with vermin, to give notice to the owner or occupier of such house, requiring him to remove the wallpaper ana to take such steps for the purpose of destroying or removing vermin as the case may require. Now it seems to me, judging by my experience since the Act was passed, that there will be in all probability a great deal of work to be done under this Act, and that the Council will be called on to disinfect a large quantity of dangerous or unwholesome articles, such as bedding, clothing, etc., and also to cause the cleansing and purification of a large number of premises. It will be at once apparent that in order to carry out this work, provision should be made for the accommodation of persons coming from verminous houses or who are themselves verminous, while the cleansing of their houses is taking place or they themselves are being cleansed. 1905] 184 I am at present using the Shelter House for the purposes of this Act, but it will at once be seen that this will not, and could not, be legally available when it is required for the purposes for which it was built, especially should Small Pox break out. At such a time the London County Council General Powers Act, 1904, would become a dead letter so far as this Council are concerned, for they could not turn the people living in verminous houses into the street in order that the necessary cleansing might be done. Under these circumstances I would propose that accommodation consisting of two receiving rooms, furnished with bedding and two bath rooms, be provided, one room for the use of males and the other for the use of females. Another important Act was passed in 1902, called the Midwives Act, which deals with the registration of midwives, and under section 3 provision is made for the forming of a Central Midwives Board, whose duties and powers shall be, among other matters, to frame rules regulating, supervising and restricting within due limits the practice of midwives. Amongst the rules so framed is one, No. 5, Section " E," which reads as follows :— " Whenever a midwife has been in attendance upon a patient suffering from " puerperal fever or from any other illness supposed to be infectious, she "must disinfect herself and all her instruments and other appliances to the "satisfaction of the local sanitary authority, and must have her clothing "thoroughly disinfected before going to another labour. Unless otherwise " directed by the local supervising authority all washable clothing should " be boiled and other clothing should be sent to be stoved (by the local " sanitary authority) and then exposed freely to the open air for several days." Now in order to carry out these very necessary precautions against the conveyance of what is possibly the most deadly infectious disease that is known, provision should be made tor the disinfection of the nurses and their clothing. It is an obligation which is incumbent on you under the Act, and more than obligatory on you as men, because one must feel that everything should be done, at whatever sacrifice, to prevent the infection of women who are bearing children. I, therefore, advise that a receiving room and bath room should be provided for the purposes of this Act. I would suggest that the three rooms that I have mentioned might be erected under one roof, each apartment having a separate entrance. It need only be a one floor building. So far as the land is concerned, we fortunately for once are in no difficulty, for there is ample ground at the Disinfecting Station to erect these buildings. Another fortunate circumstance is that this ground was bought for the purposes of the Public Health Department, and, therefore, its use will not interfere with the rights of any other department or Committee of the Council. Finally, 1 would point out that at this time when employment is so much required by the working classes, the erection of these buildings would give immediate employment to some of the unemployed. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. E. HARRIS, Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Islington, 19th December, 1904. PART IV. SANITATION. ADMINISTRATION OF THE FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901.

DUST REMOVAL. 1905] 186 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ADMINISTRATION. The Factory and Workshop Act of 1901 was, according to its title, an Act to consolidate with amendments the various Factory and Workshop Acts. It came into operation in the United Kingdom on January 1st, 1902, and it consolidates the Acts of 1878, 1883, 1891 and 1895, as well as the Clothing Factories Acts of 1889 and 1897. By its 132nd section it requires that the Medical Officer of Health of every District Council shall, in his annual report to them, report on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and that he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State. The duties of the Borough Council are also defined, and they are made responsible for the sanitary condition of workshops, for the enforcement of the special sanitary regulations for bakehouses, and for the condition of places where home work is carried on, so that such work may not be performed in unwholesome dwellings. The full particulars as to the duties of the Council were given in the report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1903. Although the work of the year was greatly interfered with owing to time lost between the 7th June, when Miss Gray resigned, and the 27th August, when Miss Brown commenced her duties, as well as to the illness of Inspector West, which extended to two months, nevertheless it is satisfactory to be able to say that through the efforts of the Inspectors the total number of inspections exceeded the record of 1904 by 451. Inspections and Visits. There are two Inspectors employed for this purpose, viz.: Miss Brown, whose duty it is to inspect workshops and workplaces where women are employed, as well as the homes of outworkers, and Mr. West, who inspects all places where men work. During the year 7,914 inspections and visits were paid by the Inspectors to the several workshops and workplaces as compared with 7,463 in 1904 and with an average of 7,293 in the preceding ten years. On only one occasion in the preceding ten years has this number of inspections been exceeded and that was in 1902, when they numbered 8,060. 187 [1905 When one looks back to 1896 when through the advocacy of the Medical Officer of Health the late Vestry appointed Workshops Inspectors, and recollects the state of affairs that were then found in many of the workshops, and contrasts their then with their present condition, a very marked change for the better is perceivable. The systematic and persistent manner in which the Inspectors of the Council have performed their work has resulted in a very great amelioration of the sanitary conditions under which the work-people employed in the Borough pursue their labours. It will be interesting to note that since they were appointed they have made 72,937 inspections and visits. 1896 5,996 inspections and visits 1897 6,761 ,, ,, 1898 6,882 ,, ,, 1899 7,233 ,, ,, 1900 7,411 ,, ,, 1901 7.371 ,, ,, 1902 8,060 ,, ,, 1903 7,846 ,, ,, 1904 7,463 ,, ,, 1905 7.914 ,, ,, Total 72,937 Yearly average 7,293 The fact may be pointed out that among the useful work effected by these inspections overcrowding was abated in 137 instances; ventilation was provided in 69; 2,845 rooms were cleansed; 2,267 defective drains were remedied; 2,858 w.c.'s were dealt with; 400 water supplies were provided; 614 surface drains were marie good, and 4,526 workshops and workplaces were cleansed. This statement, however, comprises only the larger defects, for in addition to them very many minor evils were put right. During the year Miss Brown visited 884 registered workshops and laundries, 661 homes of outworkers, 39 restaurant kitchens and 35 miscellaneous premises, while Mr. West paid 400 visits to tailors' workshops, 456 to shoemaker's shops, 128 to premises where pianos are made, 41 to cycle factories, 707 to bakehouses, 467 to restaurants and 1,992 miscellaneous places of business. 1905] 188 Registers—The registers showed that 2,629 workshops and workplaces were on them at the end of the year as compared with 2,278 in 1904. There was thus an increase of 351. Of these numbers 996 were on Miss Brown's register and 1,297 on Mr. West's. These workshops contained 3,567 workrooms. Additions and Removals from the Register.—From Miss Brown's register 173 premises were removed and and 129 added, while from Mr. West's register 70 workshops have been added and 11 removed. Sanitation.—Once more a general improvement in the workshops has been noticed, which is only what might have been expected from the systematic manner in which they have been dealt with. A table is here appended which shows the chief nuisances that have been remedied during the year, as well as in the several years since 1896. 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 Total Overcrowding 26 12 15 14 22 14 4 13 4 13 137 Ventilation 14 13 2 5 4 3 5 8 11 4 69 Dirty rooms 311 195 109 99 217 218 231 423 630 412 2,845 Drains 554 458 375 313 216 177 90 50 19 15 2,267 W.C.'s 420 325 341 355 411 375 154 161 165 151 2,858 Water supplies 79 41 35 20 19 13 83 54 18 38 400 Surface drains 79 109 87 51 78 81 2 53 40 34 614 Cleansing 412 375 393 424 437 387 558 441 609 490 4,526 Cleanliness.—The workshops and workrooms were generally found in a good condition, and as in former years, where they were not quite up to the mark, very little trouble was experienced in obtaining the consent of the owners to put them into a proper state. 550 cases of want of cleanliness were discovered, of which there remained 53 to be put right at the end of the year. These have since been dealt with. 412 of these cases referred to individual rooms. 189 [1905 Effluvium Nuisances.—As in the preceding year, none came under observation. Want of Air Space. Overcrowding.—Overcrowding was discovered in 14 instances, as compared with 4 in the preceding year. On each proprietor's attention being drawn to it, an abatement was at once effected. Want of Drainage of Floors.—In four instances insufficient drainage of floors was discovered. At the end of the year three of these were put right, while the remaining one has since been remedied. Want of Ventilation.—Seven cases of insufficient ventilation were discovered, and the deficiency in each case was duly remedied. Sanitary Accommodation— In 25 instances the accommodation was found to be insufficient. In 115 it was discovered to be unsuitable, while in three instances there was not separate accommodation for the sexes. The defaults with respect to the insufficient accommodation, and those with respect to insufficient accommodation for the sexes, had been put right before the year closed, but as regards unsuitable or defective accommodation, in nine instances the work, although since finished, had not been carried out. Bakehouses.—There are in Islington 260 bakehouses, of which 45 are no longer in use, 38 of these unused bakehouses being underground. Thus there are left 222, of which 102 are underground, and to these 707 visits were paid by Inspector West, in addition to which the Superintendent, Mr. J. R. Leggatt, made an independent and careful inspection in the month of April, when he reported that there was a marked improvement in their general condition, and that there was a desire on the part of the occupiers, especially of those underground bakehouses which had been certified, to keep them clean. Few, if any, infringements of the law relating to bakehouses were discovered. There was, however, one glaring case in which a young man was on one occasion found washing his feet in the bakehouse and on another occasion sleeping on the trough, where he had brought a pillow for his head, sacks to lie on and an overcoat for a quilt. The offender was summoned before a magistrate and a penalty of 20s. and 22s. costs imposed on him. Since then the Superintendent and Inspector have paid further visits and have reported that matters are in a satisfactory state. 1905] 190 Homework.—During the year 221 lists containing the names of 1793 outworkers were received from persons who gave out goods to be made at home. These contained the addresses of 947 persons who lived outside the Borough, and they were, therefore, forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health of the authorities concerned with them. In addition to these, 1903 names and addresses of homeworkers employed by firms outside Islington were received from the Medical Officers of Health of various boroughs. Thus there were left the names and addresses of 2,749 outworkers who were to be dealt with in Islington. It is unsatisfactory to find that many were unknown at the addresses given and, therefore, could not be found. A considerable number also had removed or had ceased work, while others were found to be already on the workshop register as employers themselves. The majority of the remaining cases are duplicated, as the lists are sent in twice a year. Notwithstanding the reduction in the gross number of the premises of outworkers, caused by deducting the re-duplications, nevertheless a greater expenditure of time than in the case of workshops is necessary, for the outworkers themselves are frequently absent from home when the Inspector calls, having gone to the warehouses. Consequently several calls have to be made before an inspection or a re-inspection can be made. Miss Brown has pointed out that in all probability we have not as yet discovered all the Islington employers of outworkers, for according to a recent order of the Home Secretary, Box making, Brush making and other industries are now to be included. It is satisfactory to note that in only n instances were cases of infectious disease notified on the premises of outworkers, in 4 of which wearing apparel was made. Places where Food is Prepared.—Towards the beginning of the year Miss Gray completed the inspection of these places which she had undertaken in the latter part of the preceding year and it is to be regretted that she left the employment of the Council before she had reported on their condition. Nevertheless, the Medical Officer of Health has gathered from her in conversation that for the most part they were in a good state, but that what was required above everything was power to compel the proprietors to keep the vessels used in the preparation of food in a cleanly condition. This is a matter of the utmost importance, because there is possibly no greater cause of ptomaine poisoning than uncleanly cooking utensils. 191 [1905 Mr. West also inspected these premises and paid as many as 467 visits to them, with the result that he had most of the evils that were found remedied. Want of cleanliness of vessels in which food is prepared and cooked seemed to be the greatest evil that has been discovered, but as there is no law which deals with the matter, it is only by pointing out the bad results that are likely to accrue to the public through such a state of affairs that remedies are effected. Legislation dealing with the vessels in which food is prepared and cooked is much needed. Laundries.—At the end of the year 161 laundries were on the register, as compared with 193 in the preceding year. There has thus been a decrease of 32. This has been caused by the growth of large steam laundries, which are gradually absorbing the work of the smaller hand laundries, which before long will be a thing of the past, or at all events will be greatly reduced in numbers. Miss Brown says in the very interesting report on her duties that this laundry work appears to be carried on under fairly satisfactory conditions as far as relates to conformity with existing regulations. It appears, however, a matter to be regretted that certain provisions of the Factory Act which apply to power laundries are not also applicable to hand laundries. At present the owner of a factory laundry must provide a fan or its equivalent to regulate the temperature of the ironing room and to carry off steam in the washhouse and he must keep all stoves for heating irons away from the ironing room. As these regulations cannot be enforced in hand laundries the workers in the ironing room often work in a temperature which has been greatly raised by the presence of unscreened stoves for heating irons. Such a state of affairs should clearly be remedied, and it is therefore to be hoped that at an early date Parliament will pass the necessary enactment. Workshops Notified to H.M. Inspector.—Section 133 of the Factory and Workshops Act provides that where any woman, young child or person is employed in a workshop in which no abstract of the Act is fixed, as required, and the Medical Officer of the District Council becomes aware thereof, he shall forthwith give written notice to the Inspector for the district. In conformity with this provision, 105 notices of workshops were notified to H.M. Inspector. 1905] 192 SECRETARY OF STATE'S RETURN.

Town Hall, Islington, April 7th, 1906. sir, I beg to submit to you a report of the work done during the year 1905 in connection with the workplaces where women are employed. During the year 1,619 premises, comprising 1,933 workrooms, were inspected, and 1,403 re-inspections and calls made. The inspections are as follows :— Registered Workshops and Laundries 884 Premises of Outworkers 661 Restaurant Kitchens 39 Miscellaneous 35 Total 1,619 Workshops.—At the end of the year there were on the register of Workshops where women are employed 996 workplaces containing 1,731 workrooms. This is a reduction of 44 work places, as 129 have been added during the year, while 173 have been removed. The reduction in the number of Workshops is accounted for by depression of trade, which has destroyed some of the smaller Workshops. Many of the Workshops visited were working with reduced numbers owing to the same cause, or were employing occasional Outworkers instead of a regular indoor staff. The names and addresses of 100 Workshops or Laundries where the occupiers had failed to affix an Abstract of the Factory Act were forwarded to H.M. Inspector for the district. The following is a list of trades carried on in the various workplaces :— Industry. Number of Workshops. Number of Workrooms.

This number comprises those Laundries which are under the Factory and Workshop Act, those where only one or two workers are employed, and domestic Laundries. In these Laundries the work appears to be carried on under fairly satisfactory conditions, as far as relates to conformity with existing regulations. It appears, however, a matter to be regretted that certain provisions of the Factory Act which apply to power-laundries are not also applicable to hand-laundries. At present the owner of a Factory Laundry must provide a fan or its equivalent to regulate the temperature of the ironing-room, and to carry off steam in the washhouse, and he must keep all stoves for heating irons quite away from the ironing room. As these regulations cannot be enforced in hand-laundries the workers in the ironing-rooms frequently work in an atmosphere which is overheated by the presence of an unscreened stove for heating irons. This can be partly remedied by open windows, but in some rooms which are used also as drying rooms the windows are kept closed in order to hasten the drying process, thus producing very unhealthy conditions for the workers. The practice of hanging damp clothes from the ceiling of the ironing-room is an unhealthy one, and ought to be forbidden. These conditions appear especially objectionable in the case of an industry where the law allows excessively long hours and where a great part of the work is done in a standing position. Another matter which might be altered with advantage to the workers is the want of drainage of wet floors in the small Laundries which at present are exempt from the regulations of the Factory and Workshop Act. Outworkers.—During the year 221 lists were received from Islington employers, containing 1,793 names. The names and addresses of 947 Outworkers on these lists residing outside Islington were forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health of their respective districts. This makes a total of 2,749 Outworkers notified from all sources as living in Islington, 1,903 names having been sent in from other districts. Many of the Outworkers were unknown at the addresses given, some had removed or ceased to work, others had their workrooms already on the workshop register, being employers, whilst many other names are duplicates, as the lists are forwarded twice a year. In some cases the same name is forwarded by several firms. Many of the firms employing Outworkers do not appear to revise their lists before forwarding them to the Local Authority in order to get correct up-to-date addresses of their employees. It has sometimes been found on inquiry that the workers have removed several years before from the addresses given. There are at present on the register of Islington firms employing Outworkers 147 names. It is probable that there are still others who have not as yet become acquainted with their legal responsibility in the matter of forwarding their lists of outdoor hands. According to the recent Order of the Home Secretary (August, 1905), there are several new industries which are now also to come under the supervision of the Sanitary Authority. The including of these industries (brush making, box making, paper bag making, making of stuffed toys, covering, finishing, etc., of umbrellas), will make a considerable increase in the number of home-workers whose premises are subject to inspection. The system of giving out work to be done by home-workers does not appear to be a desirable one, and is to a great extent responsible for certain evils in the industrial world. Homework is done mostly by women who are unskilled and unorganised, and thus without the means of insisting upon a proper wage. When the work is sublet several times, as frequently happens, the wages paid to the final Outworker must necessarily be low, even if a fair wage be paid in the first instance. The work is also frequently done by married women who do not absolutely require to work, and so work for a small wage, in this way bringing down the earnings of all. There seems to be an increasing tendency amongst employers to employ Table CXX. Giving a Summary of Miss Brown's Workshop Work during the Year 1905. Register. Inspections. Forms and Notices.

The regulations of the Factory Act tend to induce him to send his work where there are no restrictions which affect him. It has been suggested that the employer should be made responsible for the conditions under which his work is done, or that work should be given out to be done only in a dwelling-house licensed by a Factory Inspector as being suitable for such work. If the legal regulations which apply to other classes of work were applicable also to home work, possibly, as has been the case in other industries, the evil conditions under which the work is now often done would disappear and a higher wage and a better standard of living be secured to the worker. Taken as a whole the conditions of the homes of the Outworkers in Islington is fairly satisfactory, and compares favourably with the conditions in other districts. In certain industries, such as blouse making for West-End shops, the conditions are very satisfactory. In some of the industries lately included, where the visit of an Inspector was not anticipated, the domestic cleanliness was not all that could be desired, but, with time, it is expected that this state of affairs will be improved. There were eleven cases of infectious disease notified during the year as occurring in the premises of Outworkers. These premises were in each instance visited, and all necessary precautions taken to prevent the spread of the disease. The sanitary defects found in connection with the workplaces where women are employed are summarized as follows :— Overcrowding.—Overcrowding was found in 13 workrooms during the year.The number of employees was in each case immediately reduced on notice being given.242 workroom cards stating the cubic capacity and the number of employees allowed ineach room were distributed. Cleanliness.—167 Workrooms were found in a dirty condition. Of these, 130 had been cleansed at the end of the year, and the others have since been cleansed. Ventilation.—Additional means of ventilation have been provided in 4 Workplaces which were found to be insufficiently ventilated. There is still great room for improvement in the ventilation of workrooms. Even in those workrooms where sufficient means of ventilation exist, there is frequently no attempt made to use the existing arrangements. This is more noticeable in the winter time, when the employees, fearing to cool the room, object to having the windows open even for a short time during meals. Other defects.—In addition to the matters already mentioned, other miscellaneous defects to the number of 102 were found. Of these, 83 were remedied before the end of the year. Several defects in drainage were referred to the district Inspectors, and were dealt with by them. One Statutory Notice and 81 Intimation Notices have been served during the year.

Sanitary imfrovements.— I have served 249 notices for the abatement of various nuisances. 379 workshops have been cleansed and limewhited. Twenty-five w.c.'s have been provided at various factories and workshops, whilst 283 other improvements were carried out under my supervision. I have reported through you to H.M.

Bakehouses.—You will observe during the year I have paid 707 visits to the bakehouses, and I am very pleased to state that there was a very marked improvement in their cleanliness, and I trust that in my next report still further improvements will be shewn, and that the employees themselves will learn to take a greater interest in keeping the bakehouse clean.

At the end of the year £91 houses were on the Register, which is an increase of 142 on the number of the preceding year. For the purpose of inspecting these houses, two Inspectors, Messrs. Jordan and Bridel, are employed, and they during the 12 months made 1,927 inspections and 9,979 subsequent calls, so that the total number of visits amounted to 11,906, or 2,717 more than in 1904. 207 [1905 One cause of the increased number of visits was that for the first time for a whole year two Inspectors gave their entire time to this work, with results that have been most satisfactory. The number of the houses on the register in the Northern District is 345, as compared with 537 in the Southern part of the Borough. It has only been within the last few years that houses in the former district have been placed on it, because it is only comparatively recently that the houses in it have begun to be occupied by large numbers of people in the lower stations of life, and for whom a class of landlord has arisen who caters for their requirements. That these requirements are not many can be seen by a visit to the socalled " furnished lodgings" in Campbell Road, in which district it is satisfactory to note that Inspector Bridel has had effected a very considerable amount of good work. This street was one of the few specially mentioned by Mr. Charles Booth in his work on London, and one must admit, not undeservedly, for its denizens are the most difficult to manage of any in Islington. It is, therefore, with no surprise that the Inspectors, who from time to time have had to inspect the houses in this street, have all declared that it would take one man all his time to keep them in order. There is no doubt that making every allowance for exaggerated language, it requires constant inspection. In the first quarter of the year, 3,151 inspections and calls were made, in the second 3,150, in the third 2,601, and in the fourth 3,004, making altogether 11,906 for the year. Improvements.—The inspections resulted in no less than 2,834 separate improvements, many of which were of a substantial character, being made. Thus, 29 drains were constructed of which 28 were in the northern district, 83 traps were fixed, 73 of which were in the northern district, 38 pans, traps and water supplies were furnished to water closets, of which 29 were in that district, pavements of 28 yards were constructed, of which 26 were in the same district; from which statement it will be apparent that there was real necessity for the Inspector of the northern district devoting the whole of his time to this special work. For years the southern district has received m re attention, and, therefore, there does not remain so much substantial work to be effected as in the northern part of the Borough. 208 1905] The following tables give a summary of the work that has been carried out by the Inspectors :— Drains constructed 29 „ repaired 174 Traps fixed 83 W.C.'s—extra provided 23 „ amended 85 „ supplied with water 138 Dust bins provided 124 „ repaired or covered 21 Surface drains and yard pavement constructed or relaid - 179 Water supply—cisterns provided 7 „ „ repaired and cleansed 170 „ provided 45 Houses—repaired 100 „ cleansed and limewashed 479 „ ventilated 25 Overcrowding abated 67 209 [1905 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS.

The general inspection of the Borough employs the services of 14 Inspectors, to each of whom has been allotted a district containing on an average a little more than 25,000 inhabitants, a number sufficiently large to tax the time, energy and ability of any one man. These Inspectors' duties are many and varied, for they have not only to visit every house where an infectious disease has occurred in order that information may be sent as directed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to the Education Department of the London County Council, but ihey also inspect the houses in their districts, the ice cream shops and factories, the dairies and milkshops, the stable yards, the manure depots, workshops where drainage work is being carried out, examine new houses that require water certificates, or certificates under the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, attend to smoke nuisances and generally exercise the sanitary control of their districts. The year has been productive of a considerable amount of very useful work, for during it 67,829 inspections of all classes of houses were made, in addition to which it is estimated that over 6,000 visits were paid on Saturday nights to places where meat and food were sold, from which it will be seen that an Inspector's work is not only of a varied but a responsible character. Inspections and Yisits.—The actual number of houses inspected was 8,996, of which 1,725 were visited as the result of house to house inspection, while the subsequent visits made to these places numbered 58,833, thus making a total, as already stated, of 67,829 visits. In the annual report for 1904 it was stated that the agents of a certain class of property delight in thwarting and placing obstacles in the way of the Inspectors, and also that certain of these people never attempted to abate a nuisance on the receipt of an "intimation" from the Sanitary Inspectors, and that consequently these " intimations " have become so much waste paper, with the result that many nuisances of a pressing character remained unabated for an undue period of time. The same observations hold good as to the conduct of these people during the past year, but in addition there is now another class of persons springing up, who, when drainage work is required, do nothing until the statutory notice has been served, lest perchance when they proceed to execute the work they should discover that the drain was part of a combined system. They do this because it has been held in the High Court that 211 [1905 the owner of a property cannot recover any expenses he may have incurred in doing work under an intimation notice if it should be proved afterwards that the combined drain was really a drain or sewer repairable by the Sanitary Authority. In Islington this ought not to be the case, because it has not been the practice of the Council to take advantage of this decision, but on the contrary, if it were proved that the combination was a sewer, to pay a reasonable amount, viz.:— the Borough Engineer's valuation—for the work that has been done. This delay has in the great majority of the cases proved to have been of no value to the owners, for by far the greater number of the drains that have been dealt with were found to have been single drains, or drains which had been duly sanctioned by the former Sanitary Authority of the Parish. The following is a synopsis of the visits and places visited by the district Inspectors during the year. Ice Cream Shops or Factories 235 visits. Dairies and Milkshops 1,071 ,, Stables and Yards 5,261 ,, Manure Depots 148 ,, Workshops—re drains 613 ,, Certificates under Customs and Inland Revenue Act 304 ,, Water Certificates for New Houses 420 ,, Registered Lodging Houses 4 ,, Smoke prevention 533 ,, Inspection of Butchers' Shops, Stalls, &c. 6,240 ,, ,,Notices Served.—5,303 intimation notices were served by the Inspectors, of which 5,218 were delivered by themselves personally either at the owners' private addresses or at the houses that had been inspected, and 85 were forwarded by post. In addition to these, 3og statutory notices were served by order of the Public Health Committee, of which 96 were served personally and 213 by registered post. Anonymous Complaints.—It is a matter of regret that so many anonymous communications are received by the sanitary authority, foralthough undoubtedly many of them contain substantial complaints, yet there are others which are written either for vindictive purposes or with the view of obtaining p 2 212 1905] work. The latter class of complaint is one that is only practised by a low class of jobbing workmen, who, knowing that if a sanitary inspector visits a particular house and finds some sanitary defects he will be employed to do the work. It ought to be generally understood that the names of persons making complaint are never divulged, and although during the last 14 years, in which the present Medical Officer of Health has been head of the Public Health Department, thousands of persons have sought to gain the information, the name of a complainant has never been disclosed. This is a practice which it is believed obtains in every well conducted Public Health Department throughout the country, for it is clear that otherwise a certain class of property owners would have no hesitation in evicting their tenants forthwith. It has had, however, one very unfortunate drawback, which is that in some instances the landlord has wrongfully suspected his tenant of having made complaint when, as a matter of fact, it has been made by a neighbour or by some person visiting the house. This, of course, applies almost entirely to houses occupied by more than one family. Improvements Effected.—The following list of the principal improvements effected speaks for itself as to the character and utility of the work that has been carried out, and it contrasts favourably with the record of previous years:— Houses. Dirty 761 Damp 245 Out of Repair 287 Water Closets. Foul 635 Without water supply 214 With deficient water supply 207 Improperly constructed 680 Defective 339 Stopped 96 Improperly situated 27 Insufficient external ventilation 72 Insufficient in number 74 218 [1905 Soil Pipes Defective 195 Unventilated 184 Improperly ventilated 195 Yards Improperly paved 542 Dirty 67 Undrained 30 Drains Foul 47 Defective 1,087 Choked or stopped 198 Unventilated 410 Cesspools Abolished 29 Overcrowding Abated hi Underground Rooms Abolished for sleeping 40 Other Nuisances 6,366 Total Nuisances 13.138 Cesspools.—Last year it was remarked that notwithstanding the large number of cesspools that have been abolished in past years, they still continue to be found. They are come across at times most unexpectedly and are always abolished. During the year 29 were discovered as against 47 in the preceding year, and 43 in 1903, and were emptied and filled in. Overcrowding.—The overcrowding discovered by the Inspectors was not so great as in the preceding year, for only 111 cases were known, as against 138 in 1904. In addition to these cases of the district Inspectors, the Inspectors of Houses let in Lodgings had 67 similar nuisances abated, making altogether 178 cases dealt with during the year. Underground Rooms.—Only 40 underground rooms were found to be in illegal occupation for sleeping purposes, as against 57 in the preceding year, and with 25 in 1903, 48 in 1902, and 57 in 1901. 214 1905] Houses Closed.—No houses were closed as being unfit for human occupation. Nuisances from Sewers.—Complaints of nuisances from sewers, which a few years ago were very numerous, are now rarely received, and the few that have been made have been found generally to be due to the street gullies, from which in hot weather the water has evaporated, or in which an undue amount of solid matter had collected. It must be acknowledged that, taken as a whole, these gullies are most carefully attended to by the cleansing department, and that they cause little or no nuisance in the Borough. Manure Depots.—The chief place for the storage of manure in the Borough is at the Ashburton Grove Depot (Great Eastern Railway Siding), and it was visited periodically by Inspector Bacon during the hot weather, while it was also inspected on several occasions by the Medical Officer of Health, when it was found that the work was carried out in a satisfactory manner, creating the minimum of nuisance when the nature of the work is recollected. In no previous year has it been so effectively done, for the practice of accumulating a large quantity of slop from the streets has been to a very great extent, discontinued. The Midland Railway Siding in Upper Holloway, from which a considerable amount of refuse is sent away, was also visited frequently both by the Medical Officer of Health and the District Inspector. It is satisfactory to be able to report that in no previous year has there been less cause for complaint. The Railway Company have done their best to prevent a nuisance by keeping the siding clear of manure. Regent's Canal.—This canal was kept under constant observation by the Inspectors who have made no report against the condition of the water, which seemed to be of a better character than usual. Offensive Trades.—The offensive trades in the Borough are only 7 in number, and include 3 tripe dressers, 2 gut scrapers, 1 tallow melter, and 1 knacker's yard, and received 108 visits from Inspector Wilkinson (vide Mr. Wilkinson's report) who remarks that although the tallow melting establishment is now conducted under the closed chamber system in accordance with the requirements of the London County Council, he found on three occasions during the year the unpleasant fumes created by the melting of tallow escaping from it. On two of these occasions it was discovered that some door which ought to have been closed during the melting and cooling processes was open, but on a third occasion, although he could perceive the effluvium 215 Q905 on the platform of Maiden Lane Station, he found on immediately visiting the premises that all the doors and windows were closed and that the fans were in working order, and failed to detect whence the fumes had made their escape. The fact is that businesses of this character, however great precautions may be taken, will cause a certain amount of nuisance. The great thing is to reduce it to a minimum. Smoke Nuisances.—During the year 533 observations were made of chimneys for the purpose of detecting the issue of black smoke, in addition to which the London County Council reported 29 chimneys of workshops or factories that were causing a nuisance. The following is a list of the premises where smoke nuisances were observed :— Washing Powder Factory, Fakenham Street 91A, Fonthill Road 114, Fonthill Road 101, Fonthill Road Holborn Union Infirmary, Highgate Hill Ice Factory, North Road Bottle Works, Northampton Grove 93, Gillespie Road 14, Seven Sisters Road Champion Druce & Co., Wrorks, Southgate Road 20, "York Road 50, York Road Wheel & Tyre Works, Wharfdale Road Electric Lighting Station, Eden Grove 134, Holloway Road 26, Blenheim Road 190, New North Road Boiler Works, Mildmay Avenue 33, Bedford Terrace 34, York Road 154, Hornsey Road Tube Railway Station, Junction Road 35, Islington Green Wilton Works, Shepperton Road Betts Factory, Elthorne Road 26, Blenheim Road 1, Mount Pleasant Road Kelvin Works, Kelvin Road 210 1905] Water Certificates.—During the year 20 water certificates were issued by the Council under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Before these were given it became necessary for the Inspector to make 420 visits. The granting of these certificates effects a very useful purpose, for it ensures (a) that the service pipe shall be buried in the ground to a depth of 2 feet 6 inches: (b) that where it passes through an open area or through cellars it shall be amply protected from frost; (c) that a draw-off tap for dietetic purposes shall be fixed to the main pipe in a suitable position, and (d) that the storage cistern shall be placed in an easily accessible position, and shall be of sufficient capacity for the requirements of the people living in the house.

This is exceedingly creditable to the dust removal department of the Council and calls for a mead of praise for those responsible for the work. In 1891 the applications for the removal of dust numbered 10,138; in 1905 they only reached 89. These figures have only to be put in juxtaposition to see what an enormous improvement has taken place in removing nuisances from our premises. One cannot help remembering how when in 1892 the Medical Officer of Health proposed that there should be a weekly collection of refuse, he was met with a rebuff from the then Works Committee, who declined to adopt the proposal, although it had first met with approval from the Public Health Committee. Nevertheless, that report had a very good effect, for it stimulated the dusting department to greater efforts, so that in 1893 the applications and complaints had fallen to 4,986. In 1896, 4,245 complaints were received, but in the following year when the London County Council bylaw requiring a weekly removal was enforced, the complaints at once fell to 312. It may be stated that the applications to remove dust did not reach twofifths of 1 per cent, of the assessments of the Borough. (See Table CXXVI.) The following statement shows how great an improvement has been effected in the removal of dust since 1891:— Year. Applications to remove dust. Year. Applications to remove dust. 1891 10,138 1899 262 1892 9,964 1900 234 1893 4,986 19OI 157 1894 4.5o6 1902 198 1895 4.596 1903 152 1896 4,245 1904 116 1897 312 1905 89 1898 303 Dust Receptacles.—During the year 2,244 dust receptacles were provided, while 224 were repaired. This is a large increase over the number dealt with in 1904, when 835 dustbins were provided and 138 repaired. This was due to an instruction given by the Borough Engineer to the assistants of the Superintendent of the Dusting Department to report all dustbins that were found in a defective state to the Public Health Department, who at once dealt with the matter. 222 1905] Table CXXVI.

It has been usual for several years to give a return as to the state of pauperism in the borough during the year urfder consideration. Last year, especially towards its close, as everyone knows, there was a considerable amount of public discussion as to the large number of persons who were out of employment and the means whereby they could be provided with work. It will, therefore, come as no surprise to find from the returns that the average weekly number of persons receiving relief numbered 9,224, as compared with 8,086 in 1904, and 8,004 in 1903, and with an average of 7,161 in the nine years 1896-1904. The figures require no comment, as they speak for themselves, showing only too well that in no previous year have there been presumably so many people out of work. The returns since 1896 have been as follows :— 1896 6,436 per week relieved. 1897 6,486 ,, 1898 6,635 ,, 1899 6,854 ,, 1900 6,956 ,, 1901 7,327 ,, 1902 7,668 ,, 1903 8,004 ,, 1904 8,086 „ Average 7,161 ,, 1905 9,224 ,, Indoor Paupers.—The average weekly number of indoor paupers, including adults and children, was 4,295, as compared with 3,622 in 1904, and 3,879 in 1903, and an average of 3,777 in the 9 years 1896-1904. Outdoor Paupers.—Here also the increase in the number relieved is marked, as no less than 4,929, of whom 3,302 were adults and 1,627 children under 16 years of age, were relieved each week, as compared with 4,464 in 1904, 4,125 in 1903, and an average of 4,929 in the 9 years 1896-1904. Yagrants Relieved.—Under this heading there was a decrease when compared with 1904, for the weekly average for the year was only 580, compared with 65 in the preceding year. It, however, shows an increase of 35 on the weekly average of the preceding 9 years. Children Boarded Out.—The number of children boarded out averaged 126, as compared with 122 in 1904, 127 in 1903 and an average of 120 in the 9 years 1896-1904. 224 1905] Table CXXVII.

Owing to the recent revelations in the United States, the question of food inspection has become a burning one in this country, as the public, having been well scared, are most anxious to know under what conditions their foods, particularly their meat supplies, are prepared. In Islington this need not cause any anxiety, for in 1899 a fully qualified Inspector was appointed on the advice of the Medical Officer of Health by the then Vestry to inspect places where animals are slaughtered, and food is prepared and sold, and to examine the food that was sold. It is curious to look back now on the fact that this proposal was met with considerable opposition in the Vestry, as it was deemed unnecessary to employ a man for this purpose on the grounds that there was no need of special supervision in these matters as the places were believed to be well conducted, and the food good, and also, it was stated, because the largest quantity of meat sold in the Borough had already been inspected in the Central Meat Market and the Corporation Slaughterhouses and Meat Market, Caledonian Road. Nevertheless, the recommendation was carried, and the result has been a most marked change in the conditions under which animals are slaughtered and food prepared in the Borough. Food Destroyed.—During the year the Inspector condemned 1 ton 11 cwt. 1 qr. 4 lbs. of meat, which he found to be either diseased or unfit for food, in the slaughterhouses and shops of the borough. Of this amount over 14 cwt. was condemned in the slaughterhouses, and consisted entirely of diseased meat and organs, while in the shops over 1 cwt. of unsound meat was taken. More than 1 cwt. of ox tongues, 5 cwt. Turkeys, 7 cwt. tripe were surrendered to the Inspector, all of which would probably have found its way into the public market if there had been no Meat Inspector in the Borough. The total amount of food destroyed during the past five years has exceeded 17^ tons, which is a very large weight considering that the Inspector has no large market to supervise, such as the Central Meat Market in the City and the outside markets in Finsbury. 231 [1905 The following is a summary of the food stuffs destroyed during each quarter:— 1st Quarter. cwts. qrs. lbs. Diseased meat and organs from houses 3 0 17 Meat, etc., from shops unsound by tion, including 6 turkeys surrendered 0 1 16 Unsound fish 0 1 0 39 Ox tongues (decomposing) 1 2 12 Fowls seized and destroyed by order of a J.P.- 0 0 15 Fruit surrendered as unsound 0 0 10 Total cwts. 5 2 14 2nd Quarter. cwts. qrs. lbs.

During these visits more than 33,073 slaughtered animals passed under his supervision, as compared with 35,516 in 1904, and 40,895 in 1903. These consisted of oxen, cows, calves, sheep, lambs and pigs. The chief falling off in the number of animals slaughtered occurred amongst the sheep and lambs, while there was also a not insignificant decrease among the oxen. The figures for 1904-5 are given below :— 1904. 1905. Increase or decrease. Oxen 2,360 2,195 —165 Cows 4 17 + 13 Calves 154 127 —27 Sheep and lambs 32,973 30,686 —2,287 Pigs 25 48 + 23 Mr. Wilkinson, in his report, comments on the fact that the quality of the animals has been well up to the high standard of the previous year. This is without doubt the case, for nearly all the butchers in Islington who slaughter cattle for themselves as a rule only purchase the very best animals, because they are men who cater for a good class family trade, which would be injured by selling meat of poor quality. In addition to the visits of the Inspector, the slaughter-houses have also been inspected by the Medical Officer of Health and the Chief Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Leggatt. 233 [1905 It is satisfactory to be able to report that their condition as regards cleanliness is very good, and that the slaughtering of animals has been carried out under the most favourable circumstances, so that it may be safely asserted that there are no similar places in London or elsewhere that can be found in a better condition. From these remarks it is not to be understood that the Medical Officer of Health thinks that private slaughterhouses are the best places for the slaughtering of cattle intended for human food, but only that the conditions existing in the Borough are of their kind exceedingly good. Blowing Lamb and Yeal.—Last year attention was drawn to this matter, and once more Inspector Wilkinson comments on it, and his remarks, being those of an experienced butcher, are worthy of attention. There can be no doubt that the inflation or blowing of lamb and veal with the breath of human beings is most objectionable, "and is a practice that should be put down by legislative enactment. In the report for 1904, the Medical Officer of Health commented on the case of a man who had been successively in the employment of two butchers, and who did this class of work, who had died of consumption of the lungs, so that he had, while performing this duty, been blowing into the flesh of calves and lambs the germs of tuberculosis. What this man did no doubt hundreds of other men are doing to-day. Some communities throughout the country have received legislative power to stop such practices, and, therefore, it may not be too much to hope that Londoners may receive similar protection from the Government. Even the Chicago revelations cannot be beaten by the fact of human beings being allowed in London to deliberately poison meat, intended for human food, with their breath laden with millions of bacilli tuberculosis. 1905] 234 LICENSED SLAUGHTER-HOUSES.

These include butchers' shops and fish shops, and other places where food stuffs are sold or prepared for sale. They were carefully inspected during the year, as may be seen from the fact that 4,955 visits were made to them. As a result of these visits, 24 butchers were found to be in possessson of food more or less unsound and were therefore cautioned, but in only 1 instance was the meat affected with disease. In this case, after the most careful inquiry it was proved that there was entire absence of guilty knowledge on the part of the butcher, and therefore no proceedings were instituted. Workhouse.—It is satisfactory to find that on two occasions during the year the Master of the Workhouse in Cornwallis Road, owing to the condition of consignments of fish that had been delivered at that institution, availed himself of Inspector Wilkinson's services to inspect them, with the result that about J-cwt. was condemned as unfit for human food, and was destroyed. Cowhouses.—At the end of the year there were only 9 cowhouses on the register, which was a decrease of 1 on the return of the preceding year, and these received 116 visits from the Inspector, who reports that they, as well as the animals in them, have been found from time to time in a satisfactory condition. They were also inspected by the Medical Officer of Health and by the Chief Inspector. At one time the Medical Officer of Health considered it a matter for very great regret that cows should be kept in cowhouses in London, but since then he has had very strong reason for changing his opinion, because of the state in which large numbers of the cowsheds and cows are kept in throughout the country. In 1896 it became his duty to visit a number of farms in Derbyshire and Staffordshire in order to trace the origin of an outbreak of scarlet fever in Islington, when, as he reported at the time, he found that both the cowsheds and cattle were in many places in a most filthy and, indeed, horrible condition. Since then many other persons, particularly Professor Long, have given detailed account of the dirty conditions amidst which a large proportion of our milk supply is obtained. 1905] 286 These facts are now too well known to need repetition, but nevertheless they are far more than sufficient to justify the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health in preferring to have the milk supply of London under their own supervision rather than that of incompetent Rural Sanitary Authorities, who either wilfully, or through negligence, do not enforce the Order, or the Regulations made thereunder, relating to Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops.

Public Health Department, Town Hall, Upper Street, N. Afril 261 h, 1906. To A. E. Harris, Esq., Medical Officer of Health. Dear Sir, I have pleasure in submitting my report on the inspection of meat and other foods, slaughter-houses, cowhouses, offensive trade establishments, etc., for the year ending December 30th, 1905. 1 Slaughter-houses.—The number of slaughter-houses on the register is 39, being one less than in the previous year owing to a vacant tenancy at 275, New North Road. The total number of visits paid to them during the year was 2,227, and they have as a whole been remarkably well conducted, there being only in two or three instances any infringement of the bye-laws, these exceptions being due to insufficient care in the collection of blood, etc. A verbal notice proved effectual in each case in remedying the nuisance. There have been three changes of tenancy during the year. The number of animals slaughtered during the year was as follows :— Oxen 2,195 Cows 17 Calves 127 Sheep and Lambs 306,686 Pigs 48 Total. 33,073 These figures, as compared with those of the previous year, shew a decrease of 165 in the number of oxen, an increase of 13 cows, a decrease of 27 calves, a decrease of 2,287 sheep and lambs, and an increase of 23 pigs, or a total decrease of 2,503 animals. It does not, however, follow that this represents a lessened consumption of meat within the Borough, nor yet necessarily a proportionate decrease in the consumption of meat killed in the private slaughter-houses (although there is doubtless a tendency in that direction owing to the ever increasing quantity and improved quality of the supplies at the Central Meat Markets), but it is mainly due to the fact that there has been a decrease of animals slaughtered within the Borough, the carcases of which were sent to the wholesale market, such during the past year having been almost inconsiderable. The quality of the animals generally has been well up to the high standard of previous years, to exceed which we cannot hope. It happens sometimes that animals which during life exhibited no signs of disease prove to be affected with it in varying forms on post-mortem examination. These rbnormal conditions of carcases and internal organs which were found in animals slaughtered during the year are set forth in the subjoined table, 1905] 288 nearly all of which were unrecognisable during life. Almost without exception the animals killed in the Islington private slaughter-houses during the year were purchased at a full market value without any suspicion of disease in them, consequently the loss resulting from the condemnation of carcases or individual organs under such circumstances is felt severely by the trade and operates on the market value of the animals at the time of purchase.

Whilst, however, it is possible to obtain high quality in the animals slaughtered and a very satisfactory conduct of premises (which are looked upon as sources of nuisance by many people) without undue friction by constant periodical inspection, I regret to say that there are still some undesirable features in the preparation of carcases and organs for human consumption, for which no remedy is provided in the bye-laws or the Public Health Acts. I refer especially to tne blowing of lamb and veal by the aid of the human lungs, in which connection you will remember my remarks in last year's report on the same subject, and your own comment thereon in the previous year's report. This abominable practice to which the apprentice soon becomes accustomed is still carried on at most of the slaughter-houses, without a thought on the part of the operator, and apparently with as little thought on the part of his employer, who in most other respects is careful 239 [1905 to have his meat not only of good quality, but prepared and kept under good sanitary conditions, yet fails to provide mechanical appliances for the purpose, probably owing to the initial cost, or thinking that because he has done without them for so many years he can go on as usual. * Butchers' Shops, etc.—The butchers' shops, fish shops, and various places where foodstuffs are sold 01 prepared for sale have received a total of 4,955 visits during the year, and the inpections generally have been of a satisfactory character. In some 24 instances butchers were cautioned for being in possession of food which was unsound and unfit for human consumption, but only in one instance due to disease, and this only to a very limited extent. I refer to the case where a half pig's head and the corresponding portion of the reck was found, after being salted, exposed for sale at a butcher's shop. As you will doubtless remember, steps were taken to examine carefully the whole of the remaining parts of the same carcase, and I am pleased to say the butcher rendered me every assistance in their identification. In the absence of any further traces of disease, and the affection being therefore strictly localised, the diseased parts were given up for destruction and the remainder of the carcase passed as fit for human consumption. Warnings were given also to six fruiterers, in two of which Inspectors Cook and Picknell were instrumental in procuring the destruction of tomatoes and black currants respectively, which were in an unsound condition. A firm of provision dealers submitted some turkeys for examination, with the result that six were condemned as unfit for human food on account of imperfect preservation in a cold stores, whilst another firm of provision dealers sought advice about, and ultimately surrendered for destruction, 65 turkeys which were unsound owing to similar circumstances. A noted firm of meat preservers submitted a quantity of frozen Canadian ox tongues, with the result that 39 were given up for destruction owing to decomposition having set up during transit. On two occasions during the year Mr. Robinson, Workhouse Master at Cornwallis Road, invited my attention to the condition of the fish which had been supplied, with the result that on one occasion a quarter of a cwt. was condemned as unfit for human food and destroyed on the premises. Only 3 summonses were taken out during the year under Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act. In the first instance a provision dealer had deposited in a prominent position on a sideboard in the shop five fowls, which were found to be in a state of decomposition, rendering them unfit for human consumption, and as they appeared to be deposited for the purpose of sale, I seized them ; and they were afterwards condemned by a Justice of the Peace, and a summons was subsequently taken out. The defendant admitted their unsound condition, but declared that they were not intended for sale, and produced witnesses to the satisfaction of the Magistrate to that effect, with the result that the summons was dismissed, but without costs, the Magistrate agreeing that it * Note by the Medical Officer of Health.— Even blowing meat by means of mechanical contrivances is radically wrong. It hastens decomposition and injects into the meat air laden with bacteria, which may be of a pathogenic character.—A. E.H. 1905] 240 was a proper case to bring before the Court. In the second case two summonses were taken out against a butcher (who had been previously warned) for exposing for sale meat which was unsound through decomposition, and for depositing other meat for the purpose of sale in the ice safe and in a similar condition. The defendant pleaded guilty to both charges, but repudiated any guilty knowledge, submitting that the circumstances had arisen through the carelessness of his servants. The Magistrate fined the defendant £3 and 2s. costs on each charge. Cowhouses.—There are now only nine cowsheds within the Borough, the licence of one, in Gifford Street, Caledonian Road, having lapsed during the year owing to disuse of the premises. With two or three exceptions, which were not of a serious character, the cowsheds and the cows kept therein have been found from time to time in a satisfactory condition during a series of 116 visit's. Two cases of indurated udder and one of a cow suffering from tuberculosis were notified to the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council for the attention of their Veterinary Inspector, which resulted in the speedy removal of the latter and the necessary inspection of the former. In one instance we were notified by the London County Council as to the condemnation of the milk ol a certain cow by their Veterinary Inspector, but on paying a special visit to the cowshed in question I found that it had been romoved, and I was informed that it had died on the date of the notification, and had been removed to the knacker's yard. Offensive Trades.—The offensive trade establishments, comprising 3 tripe dressers, 2 gutscrapers, and 1 tallow melter, have received a total of 108 visits and the knacker's yard 47 visits. The tallow melting establishment is now conducted under the closed chamber system in accordance witft the requirements of the London County Council, but I regret that on three occasions during the year I found unpleasant fumes escaping therefrom, which were very perceptible at some considerable distance from the premises. On two of such occasions I found that some door which was supposed to be closed during the melting and cooling processes was open at the time of the emission and thereby causing the unpleasantness. On the third occasion, however, I found that offensive fumes were very perceptible on the platform of the Maiden Lane Railway Station, whilst a visit to the premises showed the whole of the fans in working order and the respective doors and windows closed, and I failed to detect the point at which the fumes made their escape into the external air. Similar offensive smells were on one occasion found near a tripe dressing establishment at Pleasant Grove, caused by the melting down of refuse fat in an ordinary tripe boiler, during some alterations and repairs to the specially constructed copper for this purpose. I warned the manager, and there has been no recurrence of the nuisance. My attention was called by the manager of a tripe dressing business to several cwt. ol tripe which was in an imperfect state of preservation* and as I declared it to be unfit for human food it was given up for destruction. *The Tripe came from Liverpool.—A. E. H. 241 [1905 The knacker's yard, whose licence has been repeatedly opposed during recent years by the officials of the London County Council, and has only been renewed each year on the understanding that the whole of the plant would be replaced by the closed chamber system, is still carried on unaltered, and although a very large number of horses have been disposed of during the past year, it is most satisfactory to report that no complaints have been received in regard thereto, and that my inspections have not discovered any grounds for complaint.

WILKINSON, Meat Inspector, etc. Milkshops and Dairies.—There are at present on the register 716 milkshops, and these received 1,071 visits from the district inspectors. For the most part they are ordinary general dealers and are not specially fitted up, as by their name one would expect, for the sale of milk. The conditions under which milk is permitted to be sold in this country are far from good, because the regulations are not wide enough to ensure that reasonable precautions are taken to prevent its contamination. Milk, of all foods, requires to be kept in a cool, well ventilated, and clean place, the walls of which are smooth, impervious, and easily cleansed, so that there may be no places on which dust may accumulate. But how different are the conditions that we find ! There is hardly a shop in which milk is sold in which may not also be found candles, soap, bacon, cheese and other articles with a more or less pronounced flavour or smell of their own which may affect it. A law confining the sale of milk to properly constructed dairies would be of the utmost advantage to public health. B 1905] 242 Bakehouses.—These places have been dealt with in part 4 of the Report in connection with the work performed under the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Act dealing with them, because it is necessary to report as a whole to the Secretary of State on the work done under that Act. Vide page 189. Kitchens and Restaurants.—Eating Houses.—These also have been dealt with in part 4 of this Report for similar reasons. Places where ice cream is manufactured.—During the year 230 places where ice cream is manufactured were known in the borough, as compared with 234 in 1904. They were all carefully examined and showed a considerable improvement on the conditions that prevailed some years ago. Nearly all the people who make this popular sweetmeat are Italians, who are year by year becoming more amenable to rule and more anxious to prepare their goods under satisfactory conditions. It is to be regretted that when the London County Council obtained powers under their General Powers Act of 1902, Parliament did not also give them power to compel these people to obtain a certificate as to the fitness or suitability of their premises for the preparation of ice cream. ADULTERATION OF FOOD AND DRUGS. Samples Analysed.—During the year 1,200 samples were examined, of which only 99, or 8'2 per cent, were adulterated or sold contrary to the provisions of the Adulteration Acts. This is the smallest percentage of adulteration hitherto recorded in Islington and is 3*5 per cent, below the average of the preceding 10 years. In 1904 it was 8"5, in 1903 n-6, in 1902 14.2, and in 1901 15.1. It will be seen from these figures that there has been a steady improvement during the last five years. Of the total samples procured or purchased 302 were obtained in the first quarter, of which 25, or 8.3 per cent., were adulterated; during the second quarter 298 samples were analysed, of which 32, or 10.7 per cent., were adulterated ; in the third quarter 300 samples were examined, of which 27, or 9.0 per cent, were adulterated; and in the fourth quarter 283 were examined of which 14, or 4.9 per cent., were adulterated. These samples were of a varied character, consisting of dairy produce, groceries, spirituous and alcoholic drinks, and drugs. 243 [1905 Dairy Produce.—928 samples, or 77.3 per cent, of all the samples analysed were dairy produce, of which 596 were milk, 204 butter, 71 margarine, 42 cheese and 15 lard. The following statement gives the particulars respecting them :— Dairy Produce. The following samples were analysed :— Samples. Adulterated. Percentage Adulterated. Percentage Adulterated in 1904.

Of the former, 45, or 7*6 per cent., were found to be adulterated, as compared with 7*8 per cent, in 1904 and 9*8 per cent, in 1903. 323 of these samples were obtained on week ays, of which 29 or 9.0 were adulterated; 161 were purchased on Sundays, of which 10, or 6'2 per cent., were adulterated, and 112 were obtained at railway stations while in course of transit, of which 6, or 5-3 percent., were adulterated. Hence it is seen that the largest amount of adulteration occurred on the week days and not on Sundays as might have been anticipated. Formerly, the reverse was the case, R 2 1905] 244 but owing to the regular and systematic inspection during the last 10 years on Sundays, adulteration has fallen on this day from 17.8 per cent/in 1895 to 62 per cent, in 1905. The Borough Council of Southwark have called your attention to the desirability of taking an adequate number of samples on Sunday. From their communication it appears that during the last three years they have been procuring samples of milk on Sundays, with the result that they have discovered that whereas the percentage of all adulterated samples during these years, 1903, 1904, 1905 has been 14.20 per cent., that for the Sunday samples has been 20.82 per cent. The sampling of milks on Sundays, as shown by reports on the subject, has been practised in Islington for nearly eleven years. It was begun in 1895 and has been carried on ever since with the most gratifying, and during the last two years, astonishing results: In 1895 (174 samples were taken), the percentage of adulteration was 17.8 as against 16.3 on other days, and in 1904 (164 samples were taken) it was only 3.6, while in 1905 the percentage was 6'2. In only four years (1895-6-8-9) out of the 10 years and 9 months has the percentage of adulteration on Sundays been above that of the week days. This circumstance is to be ascribed to the fact that the vigilance of the Public Health Department has not been relaxed, but rather increased on Sundays, for more than one-third (actually 347 per cent.) of the samples procured were obtained on that day, when the proper proportion would have been 143 per cent. Islington may well be proud of the result of its action; which one is surprised to think, judging by the communication from Southwark, has not been the general practice throughout the Metropolis. With respect to the milks examined at the Railway Stations, it should be stated that, while in each of the first two quarters of the year, 3 samples were found to be adulterated, out of 29 and 24 examined, in the 3rd and 4th quarters no adulteration was detected. This was possibly due to the fact that, in the former periods, special attention was given to certain farmers' milks, as to the quality of which the consignee had complained. 215 [1905 Notwithstanding this adulteration, the analyses of the railway milks show that they were of a higher quality than the other milks sold in the borough. This is proved by the following statement:— No. of Samples Analysed. Percentage of Fat. Percentage of Solids, not Fat. Percentage of Total Solids. Railway Milks 112 3.87 8.66 12.53 Week Day Milks 323 3.72 8.51 12.23 Sunday Milks l6l 3.68 855 12.23 Official Standard ... 3.00 8.50 11.50 That this high quality has not been exceptional is shown by the analysis of 944 milks obtained at railway stations in the 8 years from 1898-1905 inclusive, for their average analysis has shown 3'93 per cent, of fat, as compared with the official standard, i.e., the one laid down by the Board of Agriculture, of 3*0 per cent., or in other words they contained 31 per cent, more fat than the regulations demanded. more fat than the regulations demanded. This of course shows that by fixing so low a standard a wide door is left open for the abstraction of fat from milks as they arrive in London from the country. Railway Milks. Fat. Solids, not Fat.

Of these 14 were Scotch whiskies, 9 of which, or 64*3 per cent., were adulterated, and 11 were Irish whiskies, 6 of which, or 54*5 per cent., were adulterated. 8 samples of rum were examined, all of which were returned as genuine. 11 samples of gin, of which 2, or 18*2 per cent., were adulterated, 5 were of port wine, all of which were genuine. The examination of alcoholic drinks is of importance, especially in view of the fact that although it is shown by the Revenue Returns that the quantity of these which are consumed in the country is steadily falling, there is an increase in the amount of insanity caused by alcoholism. The cause of this increase is difficult to discover, but it points to the presumption that the quality of the drinks has deteriorated. At all events it is well known by the revelations of the press during the last few years that brandy, whisky, and rum have been largely adulterated by a spirit made from maize in patent stills in England, Ireland, and Scotland, which, it has been contended, is much more harmful than the spirit distilled in the old-fashioned pot still. Despite the denials of persons interested in the trade, it is a fact that the patent still spirit manufactured in England, especially in London and Liverpool, is sold for the 247 [1905 purpose of adulterating those other well known beverages. The practice has been steadily on the increase during the last 10 years so that now it is almost impossible to obtain pure whisky, whether Irish or Scotch, or rum in public houses, but only a spirit which contain? a very large proportion of grain, maize, or patent still-spirit. As if this were not sufficient, so-called " blenders " procure a rough and highly flavoured malt or pot still spirit for the purpose of the mixture, so that a small quantity will give the characteristics of pot still whisky to their compound. As a result of the adulteration of whisky, 11 summonses were issued against retail offenders in Islington. These cases, however, had not been heard at the end of the year, and, therefore, do not rightly come into a report of the year's work. Nevertheless, as at the time the record of the year's proceedings is being written, a Magistrate's (Mr. Fordham) decision had been obtained in favour of the contention of the Borough Council that patent still spirit is not Scotch or Irish Whiskey, but that decision has been appealed against and is at present receiving consideration of the Chairman and Magistrates sitting at the Clerkenwell Sessions.* It may be convenient here to give Mr. Fordham's judgment delivered February 26th, 1906, at the North London Police Court, in these cases. JUDGMENT. Mr. Fordham : These are two summonses for contravention of Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, selected from a number of such summonses by arrangement between the parties. It was agreed that they should be heard together. The complaint against the Defendant, Thomas Samuel Wells, is that he sold, to the prejudice of the purchaser who demanded Irish whiskey, something which was not of the nature, substance and qualify of Irish whiskey, and against the defendant James Davidge that he sold, to the prejudice of the purchaser who demanded Scotch whiskey, something which was not of the nature, substance and quality of Scotch whiskey. It was proved that on the 12th September, 1905, an agent of the Inspector of Nuisances of the Islington Borough Council asked at the public house kept by the defendant Wells, at 66, Hazelville Road, Islington, for a pint of Irish whiskey. A plain bottle containing a pint of fluid was handed to the agent, who paid 2s. 4d. for it. * Since this papagraph was written the case terminated without a decision being arrived at owing to the Court being equally divided in opinion. 1905] 248 It was proved that on the 21st June, 1905, the same agent asked at the wine and spirit merchant's shop kept by the defendant Davidge, at 327, Hornsey Road, Islington, for a bottle of Scotcn whiskey. A bottle filled with fluid and bearing the label " Fine Old Scotch Whiskey " was handed to the agent, and for this he paid 2s. 6d. Each bottle was at once handed by the agent to the Inspector of Nuisances, who did what is required on the purchase of samples for snalysis, and subsequently a third part of each purchase was handed to Dr. Frank Litherland Teed, the analyst for the Borough of Islington. Dr. Teed analysed the samples and, after setting out the result of his analysis, certified as to each sample that it "consisted entirely of Patent Still, silent or neutral spirit. Whiskey should consist of spirit distilled in a pot still derived from malted barley, mixed or not with unmalted barley and wheat or either of them. Such whiskey contains at least a coefficient or total of the above-mentioned impurities of 380 parts per 100,000 fluid parts of absolute alcohol. Patent Still spirit contains from 89 to 204 parts of total impurities, with an average of 140 parts per 100,000 fluid parts of absolute alcohol." To be clear, I will remark that the " impurities " here referred to are impurities chemically only, such as acidity, aldehydes, furfural, ethers and higher alcohols The contention of the prosecution is that Irish and Scotch whiskey are different kinds of potable spirits, each made by a definite method, from definite materials and both containing definite chemical properties. That both Irish and Scotch whiskey must be the result of distillation in Ireland or Scotland respectively, by the pot still derived from cereal grain indigenous to Ireland and Scotland. This cereal grain, the prosecution contends, in the case of Irish whiskey, must be chiefly malted barley to which has been added smaller quantities of barley, wheat, oats and rye or any of them, and, in the case of Scotch whiskey, malted barley alone. The Defendants, on the other hand, say, through Counsel, that Irish whiskey is a spirit distilled in Ireland from grain, and Scotch whiskey a spirit distilled in Scotland from grain. Every assistance has been given to me by the advocates on both sides, who have conducted their cases admirably, a great deal of time has been given to the examination of a large number of Witnesses, among whom were men of the highest position in the science of chemistry, important members of the distilling trade, blenders of whiskey, merchants, medical men and representatives of the public; in fact, the question of the manufacture and consumption of whiskey has been thoroughly dealt with before me in the course of these cases; though I must say that I regret that Dr. Schidrowitz, who I have reason to believe is considered to be a great authority on the chemistry and analysis of whiskey, and who was so frequently referred to, was not examined though he was generally in Court with the representatives of the defendants during the hearing of the cases. I must draw my own conclusions why Dr. Schidrowitz d'd not give evidence. The questions I have now to decide are difficult. They are, whether the fluid sold by the defendants Wells and Davidge, or their servants, to the agent of the Inspector of Nuisances of the Borough of Islington were respectively Irish and Scotch whiskey. Before i can decide this i must find what is understood in this country by the word "whiskey." Few people comparatively have, of course, ever really thought of what they 249 [1905 mean or understand by the word, but I have tried to discover from the evidence here what people who ask for " whiskey" expect to get. The dictionary definitions have not been seriously called in aid by either sit'e in these cases, and at this I am not greatly surprised after searching the dictionaries and books of reference myself. All I can adopt from such authorities is that "whiskey" is "a spirit distilled from grain." As for particulars of the method of manufacture or the kind of grain it is manufactured from, where such particulars are given each book differs more or less from the others; so I really get almost no help from the books and only find a description or definition of "whiskey," that I can adopt, which is accepted by both parties to these prosecutions. Of the many witnesses called before me some say whiskey is the produce of the pot still only, none say it is the produce of the patent still only; some say it may be made either by the pot or by the patent still. All say it can only be made from grain, but they do not all agree as to the kind of grain. " Whiskey," I have no doubt, is a word derived a century or so ago from the word "usquebaugh, which signified a spirit distilled in a form of pot still in Ireland or Scotland from grain grown, and generally malted, in Ireland or Scotland. Until some 45 years ago all that which was drunk as "whiskey" was so made. Then the patent still came into use, and it was soon found that spirit distilled in that form of still from grain grown in the country in which the still was, or abroad, might be mixed with whiskey, which cost more to produce, to the benefit of the seller of whiskey, and by degrees the proportion of patent still spirit mixed with pot still spirit, or whiskey, became larger and larger, until to day there is an immense output of patent still spirit made, with very few exceptions, from a mash composed very largely of maize; 75 per cent, of maize is, I believe, not uncommon when maize is cheaper than other grain, though a great deal of foreign barley is used in the patent stills. That part of the output of the patent still which is consumed in this country by the public is not generally sold to them alone, but mixed with more or less of pot still spirit, and then it is sold as " whiskey." The evidence given before me does not satisfy me that the public generally does now or has ever accepted the product of this patent still alone as " whiskey "; certainly not when maize is used. The evidence as to the consumption of this spirit as "whiskey" is that of Mr. McNab, who stated that the spirit made at the Glen Mavis Distillery, Bathgate, was made from all-malt by the patent still. This he said was sold retail as "whiskey" in the neighbourhood of the distillery, though most of it went for mixing with pot still product either in Scotland or the colonies. Mr. McNab asserted that the drinkers of Glen Mavis spirit in the neighbournood of the distillery preferred it quite new, fresh from the still; yet his firm, the owners of Glen Mavis Distillery, kept their spirit five years before it went out to the public, the reason for this apparent lock-up of capital against the taste of the consumers was not explained by Mr. McNab. Then Professor, Sir James Dewar and Dr. Tatlock, have been for years drinking " Cambus," a spirit made by the patent still and largely from maize. This they drank as " Scotch Whiskey"; but their having done so goes no way towards proving that the public have done so, because both these witnesses obtain the spirit direct from the distillery as a matter of indulgence by the maker. It was said that this " Cambus " spirit was sold as "whiskey" in one public house in Glasgow, and that that fact would be proved, but no one was called to prove it. No evidence was given on which I could find that pure 1905] 250 patent still spirit, whether made from maize or malt, has been known among the public as "whiskey" though in the trade such spirit has been variously known as " grain spirit," "grain whiskey" and "grains." Of Wells' sample 90 per cent, was invoiced as " Patent Still spirit" by the makers to the blenders, who sold it to Wells as " Scotch Whiskey," after mixing it with a very little pot-still spirit. Though 1 find that the patent still spirit alone is not "whiskey" there is evidence before me that when mixed with a considerable proportion of pot still spirit or whiskey, derived from malted barley, such mixture has long been sold to and accepted by the public in immense and increasing quantities as "whiskey "; indeed, many of the most largely advertised and popular makes of potable spirits are of this character, and contain, 1 have reason to believe, a very considerable proportion of pot still whiskey. Whether 1 should hold such mixture to be " whiskey " or not I am not called upon to say and I express no opinion to that. The descriptions "Irish" and "Scotch" as applied to whiskey are commonly understood, I think, to indicate something more than the place of origin of the whiskey. The words "Irish and "Scotch" are used to mean a particular kind of whiskey made in a particular way from particular material in a particular place. The term " Irish whiskey " is used to denote whiskey made by Irish methods, from materials used in such methods in Ireland and the term "Scotch whiskey" to denote whiskey made by Scotch methods, from material used in such methods in Scotland. Irish whiskey and Scotch whiskey are quite as much definite articles as are Bourbon whiskey or Canadian whiskey. In both Ireland and Scotland from earliest times the national alcoholic beverage "usquebaugh," now whiskey, has been distilled by pot stills. It certainly was so made when it was first known as " Irish whiskey" and Scotch whiskey," and I must hold that to be " Irish whiskey" ana "Scotch whiskey" now the spirit must be obtained in the same methods by the aid of the form of still known as the pot still. The produce of the patent still, unmixed with pot still whiskey, cannot be Irish or Scotch whiskey, although made in Ireland or Scotland; the patent still is not used to obtain spirit by the method known as Irish and Scotch. As to the material to be used to produce Irish or Scotch whiskey, it must be such as has been always used in the Irish and Scotch form of still commonly. This, I find from the evidence I have heard, is in Irish whiskey barley, malt as to about 75 per cent, and, as to the rest of the mash, barley, wheat, oats and rye, or any of them; and in Scotch whiskey it is wholly barley malt. There is a distinct difference in the material used to produce Irish whiskey and Scotch whiskey in the pot still, but the material used to produce spirit in the patent still is the same whether to be produced in Ireland or in Scotland. Maize has never been commonly used in pot still distillation, indeed, it was sworn to in the course of the hearing of these cases that maize is used in the pot still in only three distilleries at all, two of which certainly are owned by owners of patent stills, and I do not find that the spirit distilled from maize in these three pot stills is taken alone by the public as Irish or Scotch whiskey. I find that maize, not having been commonly used in the pot still, or Irish or Scotch method of making whiskey, cannot be material from which Irish or Scotch whiskey is derived. Between the flavour and smell of Irish whiskey and of Scotch whiskey, there is distinct difference The flavour and smell of Irish whiskey is generally attributed to the rye used in its manufacture and the flavour and smell of Scotch whiskey—of old-fashioned character— 251 [1905 called its "reek" is generally thought to be traceable to the system of malting over a peat fire and where Scotch whiskey "reeks" of the peat it is said to "have a peat reek;" but in no instance, whether it has a peat reek or not, does Scotch whiskey give the same flavour or smell as Irish whiskey, the two kinds are easily distinguishable. Again, pot still whiskey made of the materials used in Ireland or in Scotland, it is agreed by all parties, is a distinct and different article from the patent still product wherever that may be made, distinct and different in taste, flavour and smell. This difference, I believe, arises mainly from the difference in the method of distillation, from the difference in the working of the machine, the still, used. However that may be, while Irish and Scotch whiskey are clearly distinguishable from one another, the product of the patent still made in Ireland is not to be distinguished from that made in Scotland or even in London; therefore if the spirit produced by the patent still is to be recognised as Irish or Scotch whiskey according to the place where it is made, the terms Irish and Scotch as applied to whiskey cease to have any meaning. Now as to what the fluids sold as Irish and Scotch whiskey by the defendants Wells and Davidge respectively were, I had the evidence of Dr. Teed, an analyst of great experience; of the accuracy of whose analysis Professor Sir James Dewar, a most eminent chemist, had no doubt whatever. Dr. Teed, drawing his conclusions from the result of his analysis of the samples, is of opinion that the spirit is the product of the distillation of some grain, he cannot say of what kind, in the patent still. He arrived at his opinion because after analysing many pot still whiskies from different distilleries and of various ages, Dr. Teed was satisfied that it was reasonable to conclude that pot still whiskey contains at least 380 parts in 100,000 fluid parts of absolute alcohol, of "impurities" (scientifically so called); while patent still spirit, he found, did not contain anything like so large a proportion of such "impurities." Dr. Teed was vehemently attacked and ridiculed by the leading Counsel for the defence—Mr. Fletcher Moulton (now Lord Justice Moulton)—for taking such a basis on which to found his opinion, and I am surprised, now that I have heard the chemists called by the defence, that such an attack should have been made on Dr. Teed, for Professor Sir James Dewer could not contradict Dr. Teed, though he was unable to corroborate him in his opinion that the figures obtained by Dr. Teed in his analysis of the samples warranted Dr. Teed's conclusions from them that the samples were of patent still produce entirely; but Professor Sir james Dewar's evidence, taken as a whole, amounted to the admission that he understood from Dr. Teed's figures, which Professor Sir James Dewar accepted as correct, that the samples giving those figures were from the patent still as to 80 per cent, or 90 per cent. Dr. Tunnicliffe too gave evidence and produced figures of analyses confirming to a considerable extent Dr. Teed's opinions and conclusions from his analyses. I intentionally make no reference to the evidence given by Dr. Tatlock as an expert witness. Now Professor Sir James Dewar and Dr. Tunnicliffe did not contradict Dr. Teed, and if Dr. Schidrowitz could have done so I have no doubt he would have been put into the witness box, as he was in Court, but he was not called. In addition to what I may call the professional evidence of Professor Sir James Dewar and of Dr. Tunnicliffe the defence called the blenders of the spirit sold by the defendants, and the makers of 90 per cent, of it; and their evidence, if I accepted it without reservation, and I do not so accept it, proves that Dr. Teed was not far wrong in his conclusions as to the origin and manufacture of the articles as to which he certified. I am not satisfied that Dr. Teed was at all wrong. The men who actually handled the spirit sold by the defendants before it was sold to them, say that Wells' sample and Davidge's were both 90 per cent, patent still spirit. In each case the spirit was derived largely from maize. The rest of the spirit sold to and by Wells and Davidge besides the 90 per cent, was said to be pot still whiskey made from barley malt. 1905] 252 On the evidence I heard I find that what Wells and Davidge sold as Irish and Scotch whiskey respectively was patent still spirit made largely of maize, to which had been added a dash, not 10 per cent., of Irish or Scotch whiskey. The quantity of whiskey added to the patent still spirit was so small that I cannot understand why it was added, unless it was to •' save the face " of those who described it as whiskey. It was admitted by the defence that both the Wells and the Davidge article was. a very cheap poor "whiskey" as it was called by the defence; and it is interesting to observe by the light of the evidence that both pot still and patent still spirit greatly improves with age, that at least Ski per cent, of Wells' spirit was only one month old when put into Wells' cellar in May, and so less than six months old when sold by him in September, while what Davidge sold in June, 1905, as "Fine Old Scotch Whiskey" was, as to about 90 per cent, made in June, 1904, just one year before. Now having found that the fluids sold by the defendants are spirit produced by the patent still from a mash consisting to a large extent of maize, to which a dash of whiskey made from barley malt in a pot still had been added, I find, in my judgment, that Wells' sample is not Irish whiskey and Davidges' sample is not Scotch whiskey, and Irish whiskey and Scotch whiskey having been demanded by the purchaser from Wells and Davidge respectively, 1 find that each of the defendants did sell an article of food which was not of the nature, substance and quality demanded. Let me now consider whether what the defendants did was to the prejudice of the purchaser. The purchaser asked for and paid for Irish whiskey and Scotch whiskey, either of which costs more to make and, as an article of commerce, is of far greater value than the patent still spirit, with a dash of whiskey in it, which was delivered to him. He asked and paid for an article worth twice as much as the article he got. I have no doubt that the medicinal value of Irish or Scotch whiskey with their larger proportion of so-called " impurities" is greater than that of spirit from the patent still which does not contain " impurities" in nearly so large a proportion. Irish and Scotch whiskey on the one hand and patent still spirit with a little whiskey added on the other hand are two very different articles. They differ in their contents, in their flavours and in their scents. No average man could by taste or smell mistake one for the other; and after drinking both Irish and Scotch whiskey and pure patent still spirit, as represented by " Cambus," neat as well as diluted, I am strongly inclined to agree with the witnesses who said that the effect of the pure patent still spirit on the person taking it was different from the effect of Irish or Scotch whiskey when drank by him, and this to the disadvantage of the pure patent still spirit. I am not prepared to say that patent still spirit alone or mixed with whiskey is injurious to the drinker. There is no accounting for tastes, and the preference of one man should not dictate the choice of another; but whatever a purchaser asks for and pays for should be given to him by the seller, or at any rate the seller should afford the purchaser the means of knowing what it is he is getting for his money, certainly if he is not getting that for which he has asked and has paid. It is not unlawful to sell patent still spirit or patent still spirit mixed with whiskey ; but notice should be given to the purchaser of what it is when such spirit is sold to him and on being served with it he should not be allowed, in his ignorance, to believe that what he has is Irish or Scotch whiskey. 253 [1905 I find that the sales in these cases by the defendants were both to the prejudice of the purchaser. Having come to these conclusions, I find that both Wells and Davidge have infringed the law, and I must fix and order penalties on each of the two summonses. The offence committed by both defendants is the same, and the same practically in degree. Therefore I think the penalty in each case must be the same. The misrepresentation with regard to Irish and Scotch whiskey has become very usual and its adulteration by the addition to it of patent still spirit, made largely from maize, has been gradually increasing foi years, and the result has been taken by the unsuspecting public to the benefit of the distillers, dealers and retailers, until the so-called " blenders " have dared to concoct and place upon the market and sell to retailers, raw new patent still spirit, with a mere dash of Irish or Scotch whiskey in it, as "Irish whiskey" and "Scotch whiskey." The retailer has in turn sold this effort of adulteration to the public under the description by which it was sold to him. It is time the fraud upon the public in the matter of the sale of whiskey was stopped and, though doubtless these prosecutions are very costly to those who engage in them, the information obtained and published in the course of the hearing of these two summonses is most valuable and the result of this trial seems to me to afford ample justification for the prosecutions. Great blame attaches, in my opinion, to the "blenders" who supplied Wells and Davidge with the articles they sold. I do not think much moral blame attaches to the defendants themselves, as I believe they trusted to those who sold the articles to them to supply them with that which they might fairly and honestly retail to the public as Irish and as Scotch whiskey respectively ; but at the same time, in my judgment, it was careless of the defendants to sell what they did as they did, and since they only are before me they must pay the penalty for their infringement of the law. The costs incurred by the prosecution in putting these cases before the Court are of course very heavy and considering the position of the defendants I cannot order them to pay more than what must be a small part of the actual costs incurred, while I regret that the prosecutors should be anything out of pocket in bringing the matter before the Court and so to public notice. As the costs to be paid by the defendants must be heavy as costs upon them I shall impose but small nominal fines. The defendants Thomas Samuel Wells and James Davidge will each pay a fine of 20s. and .£100 costs, or be imprisoned in default of distress for two months in the second division. Mr. Walter : You will give us time, Sir, please, to consider your judgment with a view of the possibility of an appeal?

In the annual report for last year it was pointed out that so long ago as 1899 a very strong Departmental Committee was appointed to inquire into the use of preservatives and other colouring matters in food and that they unanimously reported, after examining 78 witnesses, which included Medical men, Public analysts, representatives of Agriculture, of the Grocers' Federation, of the Butter Association, of the Provisions Traders, of Chambers of Commerce, of Dairy Companies, and of Margarine Companies, that means be provided either by the establishment of a separate court of reference or by the imposition of more direct obligation on the Local Government Board to exercise supervision over the use of preservatives and colouring matters in foods, and to prepare schedules of such as may be considered inimical to the public health. Nothing, however, has been done since by the Local Government Board, although recently their President has announced that the use of preservatives in food is receiving attention. It is high time that something was achieved, because their use is increasing rapidly, and their number is multiplying. The following is a list of the principal preservatives at present in use:— alum, alcohol, ammonium acetate, boric acid and its compounds, carbon dioxide, copper salts, creasote, fluorine compounds, formic acid, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, pyroligneous acid, saccharin, salicylic acid, salt, saltpetre, sodium carbonate, sugar, sulphites of sodium and calcium, and sulphuric acid. It is a formidable list, many of the articles in which are sold under fancy names to the people who use them for preserving their food stuffs. Amongst the articles in which they are used may be mentioned bacon, beer, bottled fruit, British wine, butter, black puddings, white puddings, cheese, cordials, cream, fish, fresh meat, game, ham, ketchup, lime juice, margarine, milk, pork pies, sauces, sausages, temperance drinks, vegetables, vinegar and wine, and almost every article of food that can be named. Of course the object of their use is either to retard decomposition or to enable food prepared under unsatisfactory conditions, and which otherwise would speedily go bad, to be sold. In 261 [1905 other words, to induce the public to think that they are receiving a well prepared or freshly made article. Preservatives in milk have been largely used by people who mix separated milk with pure milk to prevent its quickly turning sour, which would almost certainly occur as the machine-skimmed product is a day older than the milk with which it is mixed. Consequently if a preservative were not added, the mixed article would turn sour soon after delivery to the customer. In this case we see that the use of a preservative may prevent the detection of a fraud so long as the proportion of fat in the mixture is not less than the low figure laid down in the Board of Agriculture's regulations. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of Islington, about which no complaint has of recent years been received at the Public Health Department, continues to be of a high quality. It is obtained from the New River and from water from the River Lea. It is partly the product also of wells sunk in the chalk and green sand formations which are situate at Broad Mead, Amwell End, Amwell Hill, Amwell Marsh, Rye Common, Hoddesden, Broxbourne, Turnford, Cheshunt, Whitewebbs, Hoe Lane, Alma Road, Hadley Road (construction in progress) Highfield, Edmonton, Betstile, Tottenham Park, Tottenham Hale, and Campsbourne, from which the water is brought into the aqueduct known as the New River and thence into numerous reservoirs. The supply in the borough, as pointed out last year, is entirely on the constant system and there is delivered daily 33.58 per head of the population. The latest available return is that for 1903-1904, taken from the 34th annual report of the Local Government Board, and gives the following particulars respecting the water from the New River. 262 1905  1903. 1904.

Block 1 may, if desired, be used for the whole district; and blocks 2, 3, &c., for the several localities. In small districts without recognised divisions of known population this Table need not be filled up. (b) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions beyond the district are to be included in sub-columns c of this Table, and those of non-residents registered in public institutions in the district excluded. (See note on Table I. as to meaning of terms "resident" and "non-resident.") (c) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions whether within or without the district are to be allotted to the respective localities, according to the addresses of the deceased. (d) Care should be taken that the gross totals of the several columns in this Table respectively equal the corresponding totals for the whole districts in Tables I. and IV.: thus, the totals of sub-columns a, b. and c should agree with the figures for the year in the columns 2, 3, and 12 respectively of Table I : the gross total of the sub-columns c should agree with the total of column 2 in Table IV., and the gross total of sub-columns d with the total of column 3 in Table IV. 273 [1905 LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD RETURN.—Table IV.
