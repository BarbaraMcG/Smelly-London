I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health Page 6 GENERAL PUBLIC HEALTH SHORTAGE OF HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATES The plans for 'the' Barking Hospital are now further advanced and the pros pect of 'beds' being available for many types of illness to which we are profile is a pleasing thought. Hasten on the day when our General Hospital is a fact and not just wishful thinking! HEALTH EDUCATION This much talked about aspect of Public Health work has spread into more varied groups than here to for, viz. women's organisations, mothers* meetings, youth groups and, through the physical education instructors and other teachers, into the schools. We would like to see much more done in this line but shortage of staff hinders our effort and curtails our expansion. During their home visits health visitors promote the gospel and sow the seeds in a palatable m for their young mothers to assimilate. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT 1948 I am glad to sport that during 1961 there were no cases necessitating compulsory removal on account of being no longer capable of caring for themselves in their own home. WELFARE SERVICES The following details have been supplied by the County Welfare Officer:- The table indicates the extent to which the various services provided by the country Council under the provisions of the National Assistance Act 1948 have been afforded to persons having residence in the Borough of Barking during 1961. Residential accommodation for aged persons continues to be developed to meet the increasing demand and a newly purpose-built home is in course of erection in barking and when completed will accommodate 61 persons. Welfare services for blind and other classes of handicapped persons are available in many ways, these include home visitation by specialised field workers, tuition in handicrafts (and braille for the blind), recreational and holiday facilities and, especially for the handicapped person, the supply of home aids, gadgets and hoist, and in addition the Welfare Committee give financial assistance towards the cost of structural alterations designed to help the handicapped person in over coming his disability. There is an occupational centre specially for physically handicapped persons at barking and this is proving a great asset to those able to attend, of whom 108 live in thethe Borough.

It provides for compensatory payments to persons excluded from work at the request of the Medical Officer of Health in the interests of public health. HOME SAFETY The Home Safety Act 1961 came into force in May and among other things, gave local authorities the power to carry out home safety education. The opportunity was taken to link the well established machinery for road safety under the aegis of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor to the existing home safety activl18, undertaken mainly by health visitors, and to plan a comprehensive programme home safety propaganda for the coming year. MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH Population The estimated population of Barking at each mid-year for the past decade, as notified by the Registrar General, is given below:- 1952 77,140 1953 76,800 1954 76,580 1955 75,990 1956 75,560 1957 75,070 1958 74,850 1959 74,980 1960 74,920 1961 72,290 Births During 1961 there were registered 925 live births and 26 still-births. Live Births:- Males Females Total Legitimate 465 416 881 Illegitimate 21 23 44 Totals 486 439 925 It is good to not that our illegitimate births though not reduced are at least keeping steady at the same figure of 44 as for the previous year. Still-Births:- Males Females Total Legitimate 13 9 22 Illegitimate 2 2 4 Totals 15 11 26 Total Live and Still-births 501 450 951 page 9 Birth Rate per 1,000 of Estimated Population 12.795 Birth Rate adjusted by Comparability Factor of 0.95 = 12.24 Still-Birth Rate per 1,000 (Live and Still) Births 27.34 Proportion of Illegitimate Live Births 4.75%. Maternal Mortality There was one maternal death recorded during the year. It occurred in the case of a woman who suffered from ill-health during her pregnancy and who was admitted to hospital ante-natally and for her confinement. Loss of Infant Life The infant death rate in 1961 was 17.3 as compared with 18.07 for 1960. The national figures for these years were 21.4 and 21.9 respectively. The following tables show the causes of infant deaths:- INFANTILE MORTALITY-1961 Cause of Death Age at Death 0-1 mth. 1-3 mths. 3-6 mths. 6-9 9-12 mths. mths.

DEATHS Causes of Death in 1961 Diseases of the Heart and Circulatory System 249 Cancer and other Malignant Diseases 185 Pneumonia, Bronchitis and other Respiratory Diseases (excluding T.B.) 96 Diseases of the Brain and Nervous System 82 Other Causes 38 Infant deaths and Congenital Malformations 21 Accidents, Poisonings and Violence 17 Diseases of Stomach and Digestive System 16 Tuberculosis and other Infectious diseases 14 Pregnancy, Childbirth and Abortion 1 Total 719 You will note that 'cancer' and 'heart disease' take precedence as the major cause of death. Crude Death Rate per 1,000 Estimated Population 9.946 Adjusted Death Rate (Comparability Factor 1.41) 14.02 INFECTIOUS DISEASES The following notifications were received during the year:- Measles 1,112 Tuberculosis: Respiratory32) 40 Non-Respiratory 8) Scarlet Fever 32 Whooping Cough 28 Pneumonia 28 Food Poisoning 21 Puerperal Pyrexia 7 Dysentery 6 Scabies 6 Erysipelas 3 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 2 Similar to 1960, is pleasing to note that not one single case of fis was notified during the year. CARE OF THE AGED The care of the becoming more and more of a problem and health visitors, other social workers, domestic helps, voluntary associations, etc. give Page 11 much of their time and effort towards the comfort of our old folk. With regard to housing, a start has been made by the Corporation in association with the Essex County Council to provide purpose-built accommodation for old people at Lovelace Gardens where the following 22 units of accommodation have been provided, viz:- 6 Two-bedroom bungalows (including that of the Warden) 12 Double-bed sitters 4 Single-bed sitters Each dwelling is provided with an emergency warning bell-push connected to the Warden's bungalow, and there is a communal meeting room for the use of the old folk and their friends. Since this scheme was commenced, proposals have been made for a similar scheme to be undertaken at the Mayesbrook estate where the County Council will not only be co-operating in the provision of purpose-built dwellings, but will also be erecting as part of their welfare service, an old persons' home. The Barking Old People's Welfare Committee continues to give active help to old people in the town particularly through its clubs and its meals service. In cool nection with the latter, approximately 1 million vouchers to the value of approximately £40,000 were issued during the year and, in addition, the meals on wheels service continued to operate on behalf of homebound old folk. The meals service is now a well established feature of this town and I am sure it is one which has done much to maintain the nutrition and well-being of our senior citizensl The financial support given to this Committee by the Borough Council was, for the year under review, nearly £44,000. During July 1961, we were extremely fortunate in being able to recruit to the public chiropody service, an officer who was prepared to do domiciliary work which means that the special needs of homebound old people are being catered for This officer has had many years' experience of this type of work and during the winter months her case load has been fairly heavy but is somewhat 1ighter during the summer months when old people are encouraged, if possible, to visit a clinic for chiropody treatment. Co-operation with the County Welfare Department has be excellent and much appreciated. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MASSAC AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Licences were issued during the year in respect of four establishments which are governed by the Borough's bye-laws. LAUNDRY SERVICE Your laundry service for the chronic sick and elderly has again proved invalueable and during 1961, 53 cases were assisted regularly. The involved laundering of 12,127 articles. Page 12 PATHOLOGICAL SERVICES Our association with the Ilford and Barking Hospital Group Pathological Service still remains one of excellent co-operation and I should like to give my personal thanks to Dr. Elias-Jones and his staff at the Barking Hospital Laboratory lor the unfailing help rendered to us.

The nursing attendance at the clinic sessions and the home visiting is done by two members of your nursing staff. Nearly 2,600 home visits were made during the year. Page 13 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES This section deals with those services which come under the control of the Barking Health Area Sub-Committee of the Health Committee of the Essex County Council. CLINIC PREMISES In connection with the future Capital Building Programme the following projects have been included:- Woodward Clinic This was almost destroyed during the last war and was built up as a civil defence post. Plans are in hand for the building to be reinstated to peacetime standards. Central Clinic This clinic was built in 1933 and plans are in hand to extend and remodel the existing accommodation. This will provide an opportunity to house the dental workshop in permanent accommodation and to provide purpose-built accommodation for the chiropody clinic. CARE OF MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN MATERNITY SERVICE Ante-Natal Care. This was given as follows:- Clinics 545 Hospitals (excluding Barking Hospital) 122 General Practitioners 270 Total 937 Confinements. During the year 942 mothers were confined, giving birth to' infants (including 9 sets of twins). These were born as follows:- Harking Hospital 527 Other Hospitals 123 At home 300 At Private Nursing Homes 1 Total 951 In three instances patients failed to seek ante-natal care, the reason being that the expected babies were illegitimate. Post-Natal Care. 535 Barking mothers attended the Post-Natal a total of 582 attendances. In addition, 290 mothers were under the care of their family doctors and 123 were under the care of hospitals outside the district I should like to take this opportunity of emphasising how necessary it is for every woman after her confinement to have a post-natal examination, when so much Page 14 minor but potentially serious gynaecological troubles can be detected and remedied at once.

This increased the price of orange juice from 5d to ls.6d per bottle and imposed the price of ls.0d and 6d on cod liver oil and vitamin tablets respectively, products which previously had been supplied free of charge. In addition, during 1961, 19,842 packets of proprietary brands of milk foods, etc., were sold at clinics.

Page 15 MIDWIFERY Five midwives continued to practice in the district, including three undent auspices of the Queen's Nurses. District Midwives undertook the confinement of 290 patients which represen 30% of the births occurring in the Borough. Barking Hospital continued as Part II Training School for midwifery and pup midwives are well received on the district. Your Medical Officer of Health is approved by the Central Midwives' Board give the requisite public health lectures, and a series of these have been condu ted at the Barking Hospital. Supervision of Midwives Miss E. O'Connor, Superintendent of the Lady Rayleigh Training Home has undertaken the non-medical supervision of midwives since 27th October, 1961. HEALTH VISITING The following statistics relate to the work of health visitors:- 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 Home visits to expectant mothers 1,345 1,266 1,266 1,058 1,147 Home visits to children under 5 yrs. 10,184 9,251 8,533 8,750 8,981 Home visits to aged and handicapped persons, etc. 4,418 5,712 6,692 6,079 6,434 No access visits 2,487 2,270 2,223 2,506 1,950 Households visited 4,340 4,763 4,311 4,242 4,459 At the end of 1961 there were nine whole-time Health Visitors and one part time Health Visitor, one full-time Tuberculosis Visitor and one part-time Tuberculosis Visitor. The establishment provides for a staff of twenty-two but this shortage of Health Visitors has persisted for many years. However, a number of part-time clinic nurses are held against the establishment for health visitors who are thus released for more home visiting. Since the inception of the National Health and Welfare Services in 1948, the pattern of the work carried out by Health Visitors has changed. Today they are concerned with the health of the family as a whole and the may include grandParents, aunts and uncles, or even brothers and sisters, in addition to the children. The duties of Health Visitors include advice on the care and after-care of persons suffering from physical or mental ill-health, injuries and disabilities, the care and management of children of all ages, health education which aims at the maintenance of good health and the prevention of the spread of infection. It is also necessary for Health Visitors to assess and advise on the need for other social services and how they can be obtained by a family and persons in trouble Evening home visits are increasing because it is realised that fathers have been neglected in the past and are most appreciative if they are also included is the instruction and advice given, particularly in regard to the care of their children. Page 16 Doctors, hospital almoners, other social workers and the Public Health Department itself, frequently request Health Visitors to make special visits to a household and submit a report on medical and social conditions in the house; also there are eleven different "follow-up visits" requested to check on failures to attend hospital fend welfare clinics. In 1961 two Health Visitors attended Goodmayes Hospital for a course of lectures and a short period of practical training in the care of the mentally ill. It is intended that all Health Visitors will receive this training, for there is no doubt the this knowledge will be of the utmost value to them in the normal course of their duties. My grateful thanks are extended to the Medical Superintendent, Matron had Staff of Goodmayes Hospital, who so kindly welcomed members of my staff and devoted so much time in planning and giving the Health Visitors such a well deviled period of training. During the year a large number of students have been received in Barking for practical experience within the Public Health Department. Three student Health visitors each received six weeks practical training. Twelve student nurses from rush Green Hospital each received two days instruction in preventative medicine. student District Nurse/Midwives were also received by the Health Visitors for a lie-day practical instruction in "the work of the Health Visitor". The valuable co-operation with the statutory and voluntary social workers has been greatly appreciated by the health visitors, for it is only with their help that the most good can be achieved for individuals and their families who are in need. Health education as part of the Health Visitor's duties is slowly being devested. Mothercraft classes with Relaxation Exercises for ante-natal mothers are continuing in all Welfare their appreciation of the knowledge and confidence gained. The use of film strips, flannel graphs and other demonstration material, creates a more stimulating media of instruction and are enjoyed by staff and mothers alike. Lectures have be given by members of the health visiting staff to Girl guides, the British red Cross Society and other voluntary organisations. The Superintended Health Visitor has continued to give lectures on the "social Aspects of Disease" to Student Nurses at Rush Green Hospital and to the f™it District Nurse midwives from the Lady Rayleigh Training Home. In the field of research health visitors have, as in previous years, taken part in various survey. The phenylketonuria test of urine of all babies at four weeks old is now done routine. By the detection and early treatment of cases phenylpyruvic amentia one form of mental degeneration can be avoided. tunately the condition are but results depend upon early treatment, so it is important that this test carried out. SOME NURSING This service, together with approximately half of the domiciliary midwifery sevice still administered from the County Training Home at Leytonstone. Vaccination and immunisation I smallpox Vaccination During the year primary vaccination was carried out for 57 children under the Page 17 age of one year and for 55 children aged between one and two years. I regret to state that only 6% of the babies under the age of one year were vaccinated. Poliomyelitis Vaccination Early in 1960 the Ministry of Health extended the Poliomyelitis Vaccination Scheme to include all persons under 40 years of age. The total vaccinations carried out by family doctors and at clinics during th year was as follows:- Age Groups Born 1943 - 1960 (1 to 17 years of age) 1,332 Born 1933 - 1942 (18 to 26 years of age) 480 Born before 1933 not yet 40 years (27 to under 40 years of age) 1,323 Other (over 40 years in Priority Groups) ... 137 Total 3,272 Boosters (A11 Groups) 8,941 Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation The number of children receiving primary courses of immunisation during the year was as follows:- DIPHTHERIA Family Doctors Clinics Total Separate 108 711 819 Combined with whooping cough 350 – 350 Total Diphtheria 458 711 1,169 WHOOPING COUGH Family Doctors Clinics Total Separate 76 526 602 Combined with diphtheria 350 – 350 Total Whooping Cough 426 526 952| Page 18 PREVENTION OF ILLNESS, CARE AND AFTER-CARE Chiropody Service This remains a popular service and during the year 12,061 attendances were made. Chiropodists practise at Central, Woodward, Porters Avenue, Greatfields and Thames View Clinics. In addition 734 treatments were given at patients' homes. Sick Room Equipment This service continues to expand and has been much appreciated by both patients and the nurses who attend them. At the end of the year 1,014 articles of equipment were out on loan. In a number of cases the provision of such equipment delayed or obviated the need for admission to hospital, thus helping to reduce the demand on hospital beds. With the co-operation of the County Medical Officer, hydraulic hoists have now been supplied through the County Welfare Department to a number of severely handicapped people. These appliances are much appreciated and do much to lighten the burden of those who care for these unfortunate people in their homes. Domiciliary Occupational Therapy-Tuberculous Patients Miss Z. Mercer, the Occupational Therapist, reports that she visited eight people in Barking during the year. Two of these patients entered work for competition in the recent Dagenham Town Show and each gained Third Prize in their respective classes for Weaving and Basketry. Handicrafts \ undertaken are Leatherwork, Basketry, Weaving, Rug-making, Embroidery and Block-printing. DOMESTIC HELP SERVICE The following table shows the number of hours of service given during the Past ten years, together with a detailed analysis of how the hours of service were deployed in 1961:- Year Number of Helps employed Number of Cases helped Total Hours worked 1952 84 318 85,743 1953 89 384 105,121 1954 89 503 101,960 1955 90 556 105,104 1956 93 596 104,863 1957 93 581 97,536 1958 97 550 103,787 1959 96 625 114,227 1960 110 672 122,026 1961 120 792 123,092 The maintenance of a sufficient and suitable panel of domestic helps to meet demands presents some difficulty because the service has to compete with the at tractive conditions offered by a wide range of industries etc., employ large numbers of women. Page 19 The number of domestic helps employed has risen to 120 in order to cope with an ever expanding service. These 'wonderful women', in addition to fulfilling their official function, provide comfort and companionship to many lonely and housebound people. The following table shows the help given to various categories during 1968 Cases Helped 1961 Hours of Service 1961 Aged Chronic Sick (over 65 yrs.) 458 70,339 Chronic Sick (under 65 yrs.) 116 24,206 Aged (over 65 yrs.) 122 19,401 Maternity 48 2,753 Tuberculosis 19 3,877 Acute Sick 18 1,165 Other Cases 11 1,351 792 123,092 Page 20 SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE 1961 The information in this Section is given in my capacity as Divisional School Medical Officer of the Essex County Council. MEDICAL INSPECTION AND TREATMENT The Statistical Return at the end of this report shows the classification of defects found and the treatment thereof. Miner Ailment Clinics Attendances at these clinics were well maintained during the year. Cases Treated at Minor Ailment Centres EYES: (External and other - excluding errors of refraction and squint) 324 EARS, NOSE AND THROAT DEFECTS: (Other than operative) 431 SKIN: Ringworm (body) 3 Scabies 4 Impetigo 79 Other 2,453 Other minor ailments (e.g. minor injuries, bruises, sores, chilblain etc.) 1,318 Total attendances 18,016 Speech Therapy Owing the year school children made 1,789 attendances to the speech clinics. are fortunate in having the services of one full-time and one part-time speech Therapist. Be. give excellent service, visiting the schools for Group therapy sessions in addition to their clinic consultations. Fair cross School as four weekly sessions and the Junior Training Centre, castle Green, one per week. DENTAL SERVICES Statistics relating to the dental inspection and treatment of school children will be found in the statistical return at the end of this report. dearth of full-time dental officers is regrettable but there has been some light improvement recently with the recruitment of some part-time Dental Officers sessional basis. This has meant that although four dental clinics are open they are only staffed for part of the week. dental laboratory working as it does for other clinics in Essex (in addition our own) has continued at full pressure and during 1961 we managed to upgrade one post to that of Senior Dental Technician, and we also welcomed back Page 21 one of our former apprentices (after his National Service) as a Senior Dental Technician. VACCINATION AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS Our B.C.G. vaccination scheme continued during 1961 and the gratifying tot of 1,164 tests undertaken by your doctors illustrates the co-operation of parents what is one of the major preventive measures against tuberculosis. The Chest Physician and his staff at the Barking Hospital have assisted# all doubtful cases and their co-operation has been invaluable. The statistics regarding this service are as follows:- Number to whom offered 1,371 Number tuberculin tested after parents' consent had been received 1,164 Positive result 100 Negative result 1,064 Students of the South-East Essex Technical College were again invited to participate although only 18 accepted. Of this number 6 had positive reactions and the remaining 12 received B.C.O. IMMUNISATION Diptheria, Whooping Cough and Tetanus You may remember that from 1953 to 1959 we carried out several pieces of elaborate research to prove that combined and triple injections against diphtheria whooping cough and tetanus were preferable to separate injections, mainly became of the lesser number of injections and in view of the fact that the protection want almost equally adequate. At the time, Essex County Council had instructed us to use only separate injections, although previously we had been using the combined vaccines. In 1957, even the Ministry recommended the use of separate vaccines on the grounds that there was a very slight risk of the combined and triple vaccines voking a tendency to poliomyelitis paralysis in the limb which received the inoclation. This assertion was not accepted by all authorities and indeed many continued to use the combined vaccines. Finally in September 1961, the Ministry admitted that there were some disease vantages in the administration of separate injections and in view of the lesser risk of catching poliomyelitis following an extensive polio-vaccination campaign they advised the use of combined and triple injections which we had fought so long to retain. Needless to say, we immediately took step to give effect to the recommendation. Poliomyelitis In October 1961 information was released on television and in the press that oral poliomyelitis vaccines would shortly become available, that is to say vaccination was to be administered by mouth instead of by injections as heretofore, we received confirmation of this from the Ministry of Health, the oral vaccine Page 22 having been thoroughly tested and having been found absolutely safe and rather more effective than Salk vaccine (the injection variety). The actual oral vaccine did not, however, become available for use before the end of 1961. SPECIALIST SERVICES Eye Clinics Dr. R.F. Jamieson, M.B., Ch.B., D.O.M.S., continues to attend Central, Porters Avenue and Woodward Clinics. Appointments are made as far as possible to suit patients and parents. Cases dealt with were as follows:- External and other diseases(excluding errors of refraction and squint) 52 Errors of refraction (including squint) 1,158 Total 1,210 The number of pupils for whom spectacles were prescribed was 718. Miss Lewis, Orthoptist, (whose sanctum is at present in Upney Clinic) treated 153 school children during 1961. Infant Vision Testing In my last annual report I mentioned that we had found the Sjogren Hand Test not entirely reliable as a means of testing infant visions, and had been obliged to resort to the E-test which is excellent but not quite so readily accepted by very young children. We have now planned a piece of investigation involving over 500 children which should help us to amend the test so as to make it a reliable method of testing the vision of infant school entrants. The work should be completed by summer 1962 and Dr. Sjogren himself and Messrs. Hamblin of ;more Street, London W.l, the makers of the Sjogren Hand lest, have shown considerable interest in our work. If practicable, the latter ""end to amend their est to conform with our results. sibling Visions I also mentioned my 1960 Annual Report that we were investigating the Incidence of vision defects in certain families. The results of this investigation were accepted for publication in the Medical Officer and appeared in their issue of 1st September. Briefly, our work confirmed that a follow up of vision among the school-age brothers and sisters of all children with known defective vision was well worthwhile, and by doing this a number of unrecognised cases of visual defect are unearthed. It is true that, staff and time permitting, it would be better still to carry out an annual two-yearly vision inspection of all school children, but this is not possible at the moment. Page 23 PaedIatrlc Clinic A Consultant Paediatrician, Dr. T. Savage of the Regional Hospital Board holds a session each fortnight at the Upney Clinic and during 1961 school children were seen as follows:- New Cases 57 Re-examination 115 Total Attendances 172 Ear, Nose and Throat Clinics Miss M. Mason, F.R.C.S., continues as the Consultant Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist. Figures for treatment are:- Operative treatment (cases):- (a) For diseases of the ear (b) For adenoids and chronic tonsillitis 116 (c) For other nose and throat conditions 16 Other forms of treatment (cases) 218 Skin Clinic Dr. P.M. Deville, M.R.C.P., M.R.C.S., Consultant Dermatologist, holds a fortnightly session at Upney Clinic where a wide variety of skin lesions are diagnosed and treated. As a subsidiary of the above clinic, a wart clinic is conducted by one of your Medical Officers and through her vigilance in regard to periodic foot inspections in the schools, the incidence of fungus and viral infections of the feet is consderably restricted. Child Guidance The number of cases referred to the Child Guidance Clinic was 43. We are indebted to the staff of the Child Guidance Clinic held at Loxford hall Ilford, for their valuable help in dealing with our children's psychological problems. The co-operation is of the highest order but alas owing to the increasing number of children we would like attended to and the shortage of trained staff, this service is very limited. These cases, though given a fairly early first visit appointment, may have to wait many months before treatment can even be started. I an convinced that early treatment of these cases is imperative if we are to be able to make a major contribution in the prevention of mental illness. Orthopaedic Clinic The number of school children referred to Mr. Whitchurch Howell during the year was 43. Page 24 I HANDICAPPED PUPILS A summary is given below of the ascertainment and placement of handicapped pupils during the year:- Category No. of pupils ascertained during 1961 No. of pupils admitted to Special Schools during year Total No. of pupils In Special Schools as at 31.12.61 Day Residential Day Residential Deaf 1 1 1 5 2 Partially deaf – – – 2 – Blind – – – – 5 Partially sighted _ _ _ 2 _ Epileptic _ _ _ _ – Delicate 6 _ 3 8 4 Physically Handicapped 9 6 21 – Educationally Sub-Normal 9 8 _ 48 2 Maladjusted 3 – 2 9 Speech _ _ _ – Dual defect (E.S.N. & P.H.) 1 1 – 2 – Totals 29 16 6 88 22 .

School from which we take an overflow; East Ham has an E.S.N. School and Ilford has a Physically Handicapped School which admits delicate children. The Physically Handicapped and Open-air Sections are taught together in one of the school and the Educationally Sub-Normal in a different part. Page 25 The staff of this school do a very good job in spite of many handicaps. Th« school buildings are draughty, heating is inadequate and the rebuilding of a mod purpose-built school suitably equipped for these handicapped children is long over due. E.S.N. Section During the year 11 children left the E.S.N. Section on ceasing to be of complsory school age (3 Barking and 8 out of district) - all were recommended as requesing care or guidance after leaving school. One Ilford child was found to be unsuitable for education at school and recover mended for action in accordance with Section 57 of the Education Act 1944. Two children (1 Barking and 1 Ilford) were transferred to Residential Special Schools for E.S.N, pupils. Two Ilford children returned to ordinary schools and; children (1 Barking and 1 Ilford) were allowed to leave at the age of 15 years as they were no longer considered to require special educational treatment. Open Air Section During the year 15 children (1 Barking and 14 out of district) were no long< considered to require special educational treatment - 9 returned to ordinary school and 6 aged 15 were allowed to leave school. In addition, 2 children (1 BarkingI 1 out of district) were transferred to Hospital Schools. 2 children (1 Barking and out of district) left this Section on reaching the age of sixteen years. One Barking child was recommended for home tuition. CONVALESCENCE Sixty-seven children were sent away for periods of convalescence of up to weeks. SCHOOL HEALTH STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1961 1.

Complaints of Unfit Food It will be noted that the majority of the complaints concerning food in Table 10 arose from the presence of foreign matter in the food. The present trend is towards more mechanical handling and processing of food which, unless carefully Page 36 supervised, can lead to foreign matter being overlooked. In most cases manufacturers take great care to ensure the purity of their products, but it is necessary to remind them of their responsibilities when com- plaint is received. It is unusual to receive complaints from purchasers concerning food which is unsound and this may be because of the improved methods of distribution, storage and display adopted by the retail food trade and, to a measure, to the wider cation of the principles of hygiene. Refrigerated stores have been in use for many years but the increased use of refrigerated display counters is a comparatively recent development. Such counters provide safe storage whilst still allowing the housewife to see the goods available. Food Sampling The popularity of self-service stores has increased the demand for pre-packed goods and if the public is to be protected, a close watch must be kept on the labels on the packets. Your officers took two hundred and twenty-five samples during the years to ensure that articles of food sold to the public are genuine and that labels contained no wrong information or exaggerated claims. The four cases in which the food was considered to be not genuine were all out products and are listed in Table 9. In one case too much preservative had been added to sausages, but the other three involved the meat content of the articles. Efforts are being made to secure the declaration of a standard of meat content '""variety of me a. products.

The Order relates to an area of 428 acres which includes 4,622 dwellings, 2,036 of which are owned by the Barking Council and 1,756 by the London County Council. The operative date was 1st January, Applications for approval of works of adaptation were received in respect of 2,577 dwellings, the total cost of which was £29,393. Of this amount £8,740 was born by the Barking Council and £11,913 by the National Exchequer. (b) Borough of Barking (Smoke Control No.2) Order 1961 In August 1961 the second Smoke Control Order was made and submitted to the minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. This Order relates to an area 133.2 acres and comprises 1,864 dwellings, 1,821 of which are owned by the London County Council. It is anticipated that the Order will be operative on 1st November, 1962. (c) Borough of Barking (Smoke Control No.3) Order 1961 In September 1961 the third Smoke Control Order was made and submit the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. Page 47 This Order relates to an area of 288 acres comprising 2,365 dwellings all in private ownership and it is expected to come into operation on 1st November, 1962. Industrial Smoke Five notifications of intention to install new furnaces were received during the year, all of which were to be oil fired. Of the one hundred and thirteen furnaces used in industrial premises in the Borough, fifty-one are fired with oil, thirty-nine with solid smokeless fuel, fourteen with bituminous coal and nine with wood waste. Whilst 80% of the industrial furnaces are capable of being operated smokelessly there is still room for improvement in emissions from the Electricity Generating Station, Creekmouth, and the Beckton Gas Works. It is to be hoped that despite the difficuities involved, these two nationalised industries will press forward plans to reduce to a minimum the pollution arising from these sources. Co-operation with other Authorities The Council continued to take part in discussions with neighbouring authorities concerning smoke control problems. One of the most urgent needs appears to be to ensure that all the neighbouring authorities initiate action in this matter. Some are making little progress, others initiating merely token activity which reduces the effect of the efforts made by their more active neighbours. The Council is represented at the Standing Conference of Co-operating Bodies for atmospheric pollution which co-ordinates the work of measuring pollution through out the country and assessing the results. Record of Factory Chimney Observations carried out during 1961 The number of observations on factory chimneys in the Borough during 1961 total 177. There were four contraventions of the Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations 1958 which were brought to the notice of the operators of the installations concerned. Measurement of Pollution During the year a second volumetric filter apparatus was installed in the school in Rosslyn Road. It is hoped to obtain evidence of the efficacy of the domestic smoke control measures in Smoke Control Area No. 3 by comparing readings taken before and after the adaptation of grates in the area. On the following pages graphs Nos.l and 2 show the levels of pollution throughout the year as measured by the daily volumetric filter and hydrogen peroxide apparatus at Eastbury House. An average of the daily readings a been taken to arrive at a figure for each month. Graph No.3 is prepared from the monthly average of readings from the deposit gauges sited at Greatfields Park and the Thames View Estate. These gauges now measure the grit and dust pollution of the atmospher which is not soluble in rainwater and the readings for the last two years are give in Table 20.

The results of the treatment are set out as follows:- JULY Number of manholes baited 389 Number showing pre-bait take 185 Number showing complete pre-bait take 50 The second treatment of the sewers was carried out by a specialist disinfestation company using Sodium Fluoracetate (1080). The results of this treatment cannot be adequately assessed until subsequent treatments have been effected. OCTOBER Number of manholes baited 420 (1080) Surface Infestation The following extract from the Annual Report submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the year 1961 indicates the incidence of Rodent Infestation in the Borough, dealt with by your officers. A charge of 7s.0d. per hour is made for treatment of business premises of all descriptions, whilst dwelling houses are serviced without charge.

The total premises comprised:- Barking Council Houses 10 London County Council Houses 9 Privately owned - 19 The Council also provide free to residents insecticides for use in domestic Page 54 premises. Where necessary suitable spray equipment is loaned free of charge. Insect Pests We have continued to operate a mobile spraying unit using dispersable gammexane chiefly for dealing with breeding sites at offensive trade premises, stables, open land, tips, piggeries and stagnant water courses, covering also the yards at the rear of butchers shops, fishmongers, cafes and other similar food premises. There were one hundred and seventeen premises treated and many areas of open land, and it is felt that the application of a residual insecticide in areas where insects congregate or breed has had a controlling effect. There must, however, be a large number of breeding sites such as dustbins and decaying organic and vegetable matter in back gardens of houses which are not treated. The co-operation of every citizen must be obtained to eradicate these sources of infestation if insect pests are to be completely overcome. Section G - MISCELLANEOUS Supply of Dustbins The number of premises where dustbins are supplied and maintained by the Corporation in accordance with Section 75(3) of the Public Health Act 1936 was at the end of the year, 6,353. The number of dustbins supplied by the Corporation under this arrangement during the year was 349. In accordance with a hire scheme complementary to the above-mentioned 134 properties were supplied with dustbins. In each of these cases the dustbin will be paid for by eight annual payments of five shillings. The total number of properties in the instalment scheme for the provision of dustbins is 1,134. Therefore the total number of privately owned premises in the Borough now supplied with standard type of dustbins has reached 7,487. Refuse Disposal Borough Engineer and Surveyor has supplied me with the following mation. The quantity of domestic refuse collected and disposed of at the Renwick Road controlled tip throughout the year was 85,727 cubic yards, the average weight 4,47 cwt, per cubic yard and the total weight, 19,027 tons. PRIVATE TIP - RIPPLESIDE Essex County Council Act 1933 - Section 146. Legal action was taken regarding fires which had occurred on a private refuse tip in Ripple Road. Page 55 Action was taken on four summonses and the operator was fined £25 on each summons and £3.3s.Od. costs. Offensive Trades Throughout the year there have been forty two visits to the offensive trades premises in the Borough. Type of Trade Number Oil Boilers 5 Gut Scrapers and Fat Melters 37 THE DISEASES OF ANIMALS (WASTE FOODS) ORDER 1957 Five licences authorising the operation of plant and equipment for the boiling of waste foods are held by pig breeders in the district. Frequent inspections are made to ensure the safe handling and storiliration of raw swill which is essential for the prevention of such diseases as foot and mouth disease, swine fever and fowl pest. PET ANIMALS ACT 1951 During the year twenty inspections were made of the eight licensed premises in the Borough. All the licensees are mindful of their responsibilities concerning the wellbeing of the animals on their premises and no case of cruelty or lack of provision for the animals has occurred. SWIMMING BATHS AND SWIMMING POOL I am indebted to the Borough Engineer who has supplied me with the following figures:- 1958 1959 1960 1961 East Street Baths Total bathers 86,567 87,152 113,277 146,121 Park Swimming Pool Total bathers 73,008 174,217 114,895 101,429 Slipper Baths Total bathers 36,623 35,678 32,466 32,282 Samples of swimming bath water were taken during the year as follows:- East Street Bath Park Swimming Pool South East Essex Technical College 11 Page 56 All samples were found to be of a high standard of bacterial purity. WATER SUPPLY Domestic Water Each month samples from the main supplies were obtained for bacteriological examination and twice during the year for chemical analysis. All were reported to be satisfactory. Industrial Water There have been twelve samples of water obtained from the wells in use at factories submitted to bacteriological examination. Samples of water from both main and deep wells supply were found to be of a high standard of bacteriological purity. RAINFALL Rain fell during the year on 237 days and measured 21.68 inches compared with 24.90 inches for the previous year. Daily records show that 0.01 inches or more rain fell on 139 days and 0.04 inches or more rain was recorded on 98 days. OVERSEAS VISITOR The British Council requested the Corporation to allow Mr. O.E. Edet, Senior Health Superintendent from Onitsha, Nigeria, to visit the Borough for four days. During his stay, Mr. Edet had an opportunity of studying the methods of administration used in connection with the work of the Public Health Inspector. He also accompanied the Public Health Inspectors on their routine visits and so had practical experience of the work done. From discussions it would appear that Mr. Edet's public health problems in Nigeria differ basically from those encountered in this country. Page 57
