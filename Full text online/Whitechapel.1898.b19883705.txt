WHI 43 THE ANNUAL REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, WITH VITAL AND OTHER STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1898 (CONSISTING OF 52 WEEKS) being the FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT, by JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH; DIPLOMATE IN PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE FELLOW OF THE INCORPORATED SOCIETY OF MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH; ASSOCIATE OF THE COLLEGE OF STATE MEDICINE; MEMBER OF THE SANITARY INSTITUTE; PUBLIC VACCINATOR TO THE WHITECHAPEL UNION; EXAMINER IN, AND INSTRUCTOR OF, VACCINATION, BY ORDER OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD; &c. 1899: LEVY & Co., Printers and Stationers, 23, Whitechapel Road, London, E, (Registered at London Society of Compositors.) Offices of the Board of Works for the Whitechapel District. Public Health Department: No. 15, Great Ale Street, London, E., To the Board of Works, January 10th, 1899. Gentlemen, In arranging the various tables and statistics which I have included in this Report, it has been my care with regard to them all, that they shall be capable not only of explaining themselves, so far as the year under consideration is concerned, but that they shall be available for comparison with any and all of the previous fourteen years which have passed since I became your Medical Officer of Health. Before commencing my observations on the matters which have occupied attention during the year 1898, it were well perhaps to notice what, according to the Memorandum of the Local Government Board, a Medical Officer's Report should contain. This may best be done by short extracts from the Memorandum itself. "This report is to be for the year ending 31st "December; the report is to be made to the Sanitary Authority as soon as "practicable after the expiration of the year to which it relates, and should be "in the hands both of the Sanitary Authority and of the Local Government "Board, within, at most, five months from the end of the year." "The report should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting "health in the district, and with the means of improving these conditions. "It should consider these subjects with reference to the past and future, as "well as to the particular year; and the account of the sanitary state of the "district generally should, while marking the point that has been reached in "the sanitary state and administration of the district, indicate directions for "further consideration and action." "The sanitary history of the year under review, should include a record alike "of the proceedings of the Medical Officer himself and of the proceedings taken "under his direction or advice. The Medical Officer of Health, in reporting "his proceedings and advice, should take special care to report fully and "explicitly on the influences affecting or threatening to affect injuriously the "public health within the district; and the causes, origin, and distribution of "disease within the district may usefully be the subjects of annual record. "An account should also be given, both of the actual circumstances of the "district up to the end of the past year, and of any improvement or deteriora"tion that has occurred during the year in conditions conducive to health or "to disease. For example, a vigilant health officer has in his Annual Report "an opportunity for pointing out any facts as to water supplies and house "construction, conditions of storage, and of removal of refuse customary in the "district; together with any facts as to the adequacy or inadequacy of means "of isolation and of disinfection, and the like. And such a Health Officer, "reporting on the diseases and their causes within the district, will generally "have some instructive details to give, either of conditions newly productive "of disease, or of matters that have been remedied with advantage to the "public health." "In making systematic inspections, as in much of his other action, the "Medical Officer of Health will usually have required the assistance of the 4 "Inspectors of Nuisances; and it will be for the Medical Officer to include in "his report an account of the action which, at his instance, the inspectors "may have taken for the removal of nuisances injurious to health." "What has been said above with regard to the information which an annual report should contain must be understood, not as suggesting that the 'report should be limited to these subjects, or that more detailed or differently "arranged tabular statements may not be added, but as indicating the sort of "information required by the Board's Order. Many Medical Officers of Health "will doubtless, with great advantage to the administration of their districts, "furnish much more detailed information respecting particular questions to "which they have been led by the circumstances of the foregoing years, to "devote attention, or in the investigation of which they may have arrived at "valuable conclusions." In explanation of the means which enable me to offer my Report for your consideration within a fortnight of the termination of the year to which it refers, I need only say that not only the Tables which I personally keep, but most of those for which the Inspectors are responsible, are kept up to date throughout the year. We are thus enabled week by week, and in the most important matters, day by day to see immediately what is the condition of the District. Is any part of the District unduly attacked by any zymotic disease? We have the information ready to lead to a rigorous examination of the cause. These various sheets are always in view, so that at any time should a visitor desire to know whether a child could safely be sent to a country home, it is at once seen whether any case of infectious disease was recently notified from the house where the child lives. When the year expires, nearly all the Tables contained in my Annual Report, are ready to be presented for your perusal, and copious notes of the leading subjects are available to further assist me in the early compilation of the Report. In considering the various items of information which I have tabulated in the "Appendix,"attention must be drawn to the fact that since I commenced to issue Annual Reports, the Sub-Registration districts have been twice decreased in number. Originally there were five, viz. :—Spitalfields, Mile End New Town, Whitechapel Church, Goodman's Fields, and Aldgate. The retirement of the late Mr. Sparks was made the occasion of the union of Goodman's Fields with Aldgate, and now the death of Mr. John Hall has induced the Registrar-General to make another change : Part of Whitechapel Church will be added to the amalgamated Goodman's Fields and Aldgate Sub-Districts,—and the larger part (including the London Hospital) will be absorbed into the Mile End New Town Sub-District. This new arrangement of districts will of course interfere in the future with my custom of contrasting the conditions for the current year with previous years, so far as these altered sub-districts are concerned, but on the other hand there are good reasons for the change. On the 1st January, 1899, the registration work of the three new sub-districts commenced under the three registrars already in occupation of the appointments. The great question which has occupied the attention of the East End Boards and Vestries during the summer months, has been how the inability on the part of the East London Water Company to maintain a constant service of water could be dealt with. The history, so far as our district is concerned, may be stated chronologically thus:—On Monday, the 22nd of August, the East London Water Company discontinued the constant Service and the Water was 'turned on in the District for three hours in the morning and three hours in the evening. On Monday, the 29th of August, a special Board Meeting was convened, and 5 approval was given to the arrangements which the officers had made to avert, as far as practicable, the difficulty arising from the limitation of water supply. On Saturday, the 3rd September, a further diminution in supply took place, and from that date water was only turned on for two hours twice daily. Stand pipes for the supply of water were erected in prominent places. Street watering and gulley flushing ceased to take place with East London Water—but water from the New River, as well as from the well in the Destructor Yard was freely used for these purposes. The East London Waterworks Company arranged to supply the Board with as many stone jars as should be required for distribution among the poorer inhabitants who were unable to store water for drinking purposes. Notices were printed and distributed throughout the District informing the inhabitants of the hours when the Company had arranged to turn on the water, and also stating that application could be made at the Offices of the Board by persons who required jars. The reason for the latter notice was to enable the Inspectors to visit the homes of applicants, to get information at once of any nuisance which might arise through the limitation of the Water Supply. It soon became apparent that the pans of water closets in the homes of the poor were liable to become choked, and that the house drains became foul where they were used by many people. With the co-operation of the Surveyor, after a consultation with that gentleman and with the Clerks, it was arranged that water vans should be employed to take water to those houses which required it, and that regular daily flushing of water closets of such houses should be carried out. From this time until the Company renewed the constant water supply, nine men were constantly employed with three water vans in carrying on this useful work Each closet which was discovered to be choked, was cleared by means of a plunger, then pails of water were dashed down, and disinfectants were also freely used. Constant service was resumed on the 12th of December, a nine hours supply having taken place on November 23rd. In addition to the above measures, disinfection was regularly performed with per-chloride solution by an additional man. The water closets connected with nearly 300 of the houses occupied by the poorest people were thus daily treated. Whether these precautions limited the number of Infectious cases it is of course impossible to say, but it is interesting to note that the fees paid during the third quarter, for the notification of such diseases, were the lowest since any record has been kept. The number of cases of Infectious disease will be found in Table " O " of the Appendix. During the year, the Fees paid for notification of Infectious diseases amounted to the sum of ,£68 11s., and for the three previous years the Fees were respectively ,£109 11s. ; £131 6s.; and £110 5s. It is not within my province to discuss the great water question—but I do say that means should be taken to prevent any limitation of pure water in the future. Although connected with the Surveyor's Department, I may be permitted to state that so soon as the necessary arrangements have been completed, the dustmen will call at the houses for the dust pails. They will then cease to remain upon the pavements as eyesores and often nuisances, as at present. By direction of the Chairman of the Board, a sample of water from the Destructor Yard was submitted to Professor Attfield. The result of his analysis is given below, 6 REPORT ON A SAMPLE OF WATER TAKEN FROM THE WELL IN THE DESTRUCTOR YARD:— Report on a sample of water received from Dr. Loane, M.O.H., to the Whitechapel District Board of Works, on September 12th, 1898. By Professor John Attfikld, Ph.D., F.R.S.; Professor of Practical Chemistry to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, 1862 to 1896; author of a Manual of Chemistry and a Handbook on Water supplies, etc., London, September 13th, 1898. 111, Temple Chambers, E.C. The appended analytical data show that this water contains a contaminating quantity of organic (animal or vegetable) matter. In addition it contains a large amount of dissolved solids and is a decidedly hard water. I11 my opinion it is not a suitable water for drinking and general domestic use. Signed, John Attfield. ANALYTICAL DATA. One gallon contains the following number of grains and decimal parts of a grain of the respective substances :— Total suspended solid matter, dried at 250F.

Oxygen absorbed in three hours Signed, John Attfield. Apropos of Analysis.—I wish to call attention to some analyses of Ice Creams at the end of this report. The samples were submitted at a time when much excitement on this subject was present in London. Through the Chairman of the Board of the City of London, as also the London and India Joint Dock Company agreed to supply water if required. The former offer was taken advantage of to some extent by the Surveyor. The marriages which took place within the District numbered 512. Last year they amounted to 504 and in the two previous years they were respectively 434 and 409. The total births which were registered in the four Sub-Registration Districts during the 52 weeks of the year 1898, amounted to 3,125 as compared with 3,150 for the year 1897. 7 In the Whitechapel Infirmary 105 births took place, of which number 17 were the children of women who had not previously resided in the District. Distributing the remaining births among the Sub-Registration Districts to which the mothers belonged, the correct apportionment of births was as under:— Spitalfields. Mile End New Town. Whitechapel Church. Goodman's Fields. Total. 1091 676 916 425 3108 So that the number of births as corrected amounted to 3,108, viz. 1,557 boys and 1,551 girls. See Table A* of the Appendix. It is to be noticed that very little variation has occured in the births and deaths during the past two years; from this as well as from other considerations, I assume that probably the population has not increased at the same ratio as was the case during the last inter-censal periods. If therefore, for statistical purposes, we fix the population of the District at 80,000 persons of all ages, it is certain that the estimate will not be an exaggerated one. The Metropolitan birth-rate equalled 29.4 per 1,000. The District birth-rate equalled 38.8 per 1,000. The total deaths which were registered during the year numbered 2,378, viz:—1,401 males, and 977 females. Table Bt of the Appendix, shows the deaths which were registered in the Sub-Registration Districts. A deduction has now to be made of those deaths to the number of 1,005, which occurred among Non-Residents (mostly in the London Hospital); and then to the remaining sum must be added the deaths of those Residents who died in Outlying Public Institutions, and in other places outside the District These deaths numbered 203, against 210 for the previous year. The places where the deaths were registered are tabulated in the Appendix as usual—Table D § Thus the corrected number of District deaths for the year 1898 was 1576, or 5 fewer than was the case in 1897. 912 males died as compared with 664 females. A death-rate for the year of 19.7 per 1,000 is to be recorded, which corresponds with the death-rate for the previous year. The Metropolitan death-rate equalled 18.6 per 1,000. The latter however has not been corrected in the manner which is possible in dealing with the District Rate. I append a Table showing the correct number of District deaths for each Sub-Registration District during the past ten years:— CORRECT DISTRICT MORTALITY TABLE FOR TEN YEARS ENDING 1898.

In the four preceding years it was for each year respectively, 1,548, 1,554, 1,308, and 1,568. The ages at death of the Residents who died during the year are recorded in Table F* of the Appendix. The percentage of deaths for each Age period was as follows: — 28.1 % of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 15.9% „ between the ages of 1 and 5. 4-5 % „ „ 5 and 20. 13.0% „ „ 20 and 40. 19.7 % „ „ 40 and 60. 15.8% „ „ 60 and 80. 2.7 % „ Over the age of 80. Compared with the Metropolitan deaths (including Whitechapel), the Infant deaths were as follows:— The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London, equalled 26.6 per cent. of the total deaths, and 15.2 per cent of the registered births; whilst in the Whitechapel District those Infants who died under the age of one year equalled 28.2 per cent. of the total deaths, and 14.1 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were for London equal to 40.8 per cent. of the total deaths, and 25.8 per cent. of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 44.0 per cent. of the total deaths, and 22.2 per cent. of the registered births. For comparison purposes I have extracted a small table from the RegistrarGeneral's Returns. Once again our District occupies the foremost position in the list. The Tower of London deaths are included in those for the Whitechapel District, although for rating purposes it is extra-parochial.

Our District again suffers when contrasted with the whole of London, so far as diseases of a constitutional class are concerned. It is chiefly in respect of Phthisis and diseases of Tubercular character that the increase is to be *Page 24 t Page 26 9 credited. I have previously stated that in all deaths from Phthisis, where it is possible to do so, disinfection is carried out as though the death were due to a Zymotic disease. 1 am happy to state that now we have the assistance in this direction of the Sanitary Committee of the Jewish Board of Guardians. After an exhaustive enquiry into the subject, the Committee have given instructions that in all cases of Phthisis, when the patient has relations with the Board, their Inspector is to see that complete disinfection shall be effected in every part of the rooms which have been occupied by patients, and I hope that benefit will result from this order. In this, as in all other sanitary work, your officers work in sympathy and harmony with the Inspector appointed by the Jewish Board. In considering the percentage of Deaths to total Deaths from Diseases of the Zymotic Class, it is satisfactory to notice that the Whitechapel District— again records a rate diminishing even faster than is the case for London as a whole. In the whole of London in the year 1897 there were 17 deaths registered from Small-pox: last year only one death was caused by that disease. From the Metropolitan Asylums' Board weekly returns, 1 find that throughout the year over four and a half millions of people were unable to contribute more than 35 cases of the disease. Two of the cases were credited to White chapel ; one was imported from abroad, but the source of infection in the other case I was unable to trace. The year 1898 was remarkable for at least two things—it was the Centenary of the publication by Jenner of his great work upon Vaccination, and it was also the year when the last Vaccination Bill received the Royal assent. The work of Jenner has resulted in practically eliminating Small-pox from our midst we shall see later on what will be the result of the new law. In the meantime, we still have continental countries determined to stand by the discovery which has done so much for their nations, and thus an object lesson will be lacking in the future, should England allow the protective work to diminish. I do not fear for Whitechapel so much—as only 60 persons have taker advantage of the " Conscientious Objection " clause of the Act. OLD AGE DEATHS. Age Distribution of the Deaths.

During the year 1898 a total of 211 bodies (133 males and 78 females) were deposited in the Public Mortuary, either for inquest purposes or for the purpose of awaiting burial. For the latter purpose the institution received 18 bodies, There were 47 post-mortem examinations. Shrouds had to be provided to the number of 53. The fees paid by the Coroner on behalf of the London County Council for the use of the Court amounted to the sum of £30 2s. The London County Council have agreed to pay an annual sum of £75 in lieu of the fee per inquest system, and as this arrangement commenced last summer, an adjustment will be made to give effect to it. Of the total admissions, 79 were infants under the age of 1; 26 were between the ages of 1 and 5; 7 were between the ages of 5 and 20; 27 were between the ages of 20 and 40; 42 were between the ages of 40 and 60; 26 were between the ages of 60 and 80; and 4 were over 80 years of age.

For the census of the apartments, I am indebted mostly to the owners of the buildings. The total population appears to be less by 376 than was the case last year. 12 I have so frequently discussed the hygienic value of these block dwellings, as compared with other residences of the labouriug classes, that at present I have little to add. I think that no building should be erected so high that water on the constant service system cannot reach to the top floor; 1 should like the bye-laws of the Board, which are applicable to houses let in lodgings and occupied by members of more than one family, to be amended so as to apply to such of the model dwellings as may fall below a standard to be agreed upon by the Board. If the population as given be correct, the death-rate in the Model Dwellings for the year was only 16.1 per 1,000, and the Zymotic death-rate equalled 1.4 per 1,000. Apropos of this matter comes the question of overcrowding and of high rents. I am aware that some exaggeration has taken place in considering the former; as regards the latter, it is most probable that therein will be found the kernel of the whole problem. While it is possible for property to fetch a sum at public auction which will allow to the purchaser 5 per cent. on his outlay, and when the cost of structural alterations and repairs are added to the purchase-money, how can the future tenants obtain possession without paying high rents. This explains the reason for people offering large premiums for the keys, and engaging to pay increased rents; this explains why the new tenants have to sub-let to the utmost capacity of the premises. This condition has been continually increasing, and the end of the difficulty has not yet been reached. 1 would suggest that no public money should be advanced to builders of residences for the working classes where the rent per room was not limited to 2/6 or 2/0 ner week.

RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, Inspector Appointed under the said Acts. 35 Board or Works, Whitechapel District, Public Health Department. To Dr. Joseph Loane, Medical Officer of Health Sir, According to the usual custom we hand you herewith a Tabulated Statement, setting out the work carried out by us during the past year. It will be seen that a large amount of work has again been accomplished. The space which it would require, alone prevents us giving details of the work. House to house inspection has been systematically carried out during the year. Many night visits have been made with the view to the discovery of overcrowding. Great care and attention was paid to the question of unwholesome Food. At the foot of the Statement above referred to will be found particulars of the Articles seized and destroyed. Only 18 Summones were issued under the Public Health (London) Act during the year—a decrease of 8 as compared with last year. The Fines and Costs recovered amounted in all to £32 2s. A detailed Statement of these Summonses we also hand you herewith. Last year we reported that 991 cases of Infectious Disease had occurred. We are very pleased this year to report a decrease of 335 cases, making a total of 656. Disinfection was promptly carried out in every instance. We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants, RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, THOMAS P. WRACK, GEORGE HARVEY, ALFRED COOK, HERBERT MILLS, WILLIAM SHEPHERD, Sanitary Inspectors. 31st December, 1898, 36 CHEMICAL AND ANALYTICAL LABORATORIES, 19 and 20, aldgate, London, E.C., 16th July, 1898. Dear Sir, I have completed the analysis of the four samples of ice cream received from you last week, and numbered consecutively 73 to 76, and find that they were all composed of a mixture of milk, sugar, farinacious matter, and a little white of egg. They were tested for the presence of poisonous metals, which were absent in two of the samples; in the others (No. 75 and 76) a faint trace of zinc was detected. The quantity found was, however, too small to be of any importance and insufficient to be injurious to health. Special bacteriological examinations were made of each sample, but no pathological organism was found in either. There was good evidence in the fact that all the starch granules present were burst in each sample, that the cream had been all boiled previous to freezing; therefore the result of the bacteriological and chemical examination being satisfactory. I am of opinion that they were all of a wholesome character. Yours faithfully, W. C. YOUNG. Mr. R. S. Wrack, 15, Great Alie Street, Whitechapel, E. 37 CHEMICAL AND ANALYTICAL LABORATORIES, 19 & 20, Aldgate, London, E.C. 29th July, 1898. Mr. R. S. Wrack, 15, Great Alie Street, Whitechapel, E. Dear Sir, I have completed the analysis of the two samples of lemon ice, marked respectively 83 and 84, received from you on the 25th inst., and find that they were composed of water, sugar, and lemon juice. Both samples contained a minute trace of tin and a trace of zinc. The trace of zinc in sample No. 84 amounted to the equivalent of 1.1 grains of sulphate of zinc in 10 ounces, and the quantity in sample No. 83 was too small to be determined; therefore there was insufficient in either to be injurious to health. Both samples were submitted to bacteriological examination, but I was unable to detect a single pathogenic organism in either. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, W. C. YOUNG. 38 PROCEEDINGS TAKEN UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. Situation of Premises. Nature of Nuisance or Complaint. Date of hearing of Summons. Result. 32, Church Lane Defective drain.
