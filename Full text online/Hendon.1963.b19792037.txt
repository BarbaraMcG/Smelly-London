Young, M.B.E. 4 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the Year 1963 To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Hendon. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Report for the year 1963, and am pleased to report that the statistics relating to health are very satisfactory. The mortality figures show the changes in the trend of lung disease, lung cancer continuing its unwelcome pace with 83 deaths; of these no fewer than 34 were men under 65 years of age. Pulmonary tuberculosis once described as "a captain of the men of death" was given as the cause of only 5 deaths. There was a decline in the number of deaths from Bronchitis, and one hopes that this trend will continue as smoke control advances. Two cases of Diphtheria were notified, both in the same family, and they had a large number of school contacts; fortunately, however, their school mates were well immunised and the disease did not spread. The Housing Act of 1961 gives powers to the Local Authority to require improvement of, or the provision of additional sanitary amenities in houses which are occupied by more than one family, and such houses situated outside the Council's Housing Areas are now being brought up to a more reasonable standard. More progress has been made towards clean food, and the important work of inspection has done much to raise the standards in food preparation rooms. The fate of overspill beer was investigated during the routine inspection of licensed premises, and in one instance it was found that overspill beer was collected for resale. This was stopped, and it can now be claimed that there is no risk of being served with overspill beer in Hendon. During the year there has been a welcome interest in hygiene by members of the public in regard to better food handling and also in a demand for a reduction in the amount of fouling of the environment by pigeons and dogs. During the year much interest has been directed towards the evolution of the new London Borough of Barnet into which Hendon will merge on 1st April, 1965, and I am sure that the new Council of the Borough of Barnet will continue the progress that Hendon has made. I would like to thank the members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement, and also the members of the staff for their loyal and conscientious service during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. L. PATTON. Medical Officer of Health. 5 SECTION A : STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA GENERAL WARDS (9) AREA IN ACRES Edgware 2,327 Burnt Oak 477 Mill Hill 2,695 West Hendon 1,143 Central 1,139 Park 580 Golders Green 748 Garden Suburb 669 Childs Hill 593 Area of the Borough 10,371 Population figures supplied by Registrar General 150,200 Density of population, i.e. number of persons per acre 14.48 Number of inhabited houses at 31st December 1963 (according to Rate Book) 44,872 Average number of persons per house 3.35 Rateable value as at 31st December 1963 £11,067,550 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £44,500 BIRTHS LIVE BIRTHS: Male Female Total Legitimate 1,037 967 2,004 Illegitimate 76 76 152 1,113 1,043 2,156 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population 14.35 Birth Rate corrected for comparison with other areas 13.92 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births 7.0% Comparability factor supplied by Registrar-General 0.97 Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population, England and Wales 18. 2 Corresponding Rate for the Borough of Hendon for the year 1962 13.62 STILLBIRTHS: Male Female Total Legitimate 17 7 24 Illegitimate 1 — 1 18 7 25 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 Total Births 11.59 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 Total Births, England and Wales 17.3 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 Home Population 0.16 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 Home Population, England and Wales 0.32 6 DEATHS Male Female Total 855 829 1,684 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population 11.21 Death Rate corrected for comparison with other areas 11.32 Comparability factor supplied by Registrar-General 1.01 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population, England and Wales 12. 2 Corresponding Rate for the Borough of Hendon for the year 1962 11.34 MATERNAL MORTALITY Number of women dying in consequence of childbirth 0 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 total births 0.0 Comparative figure for England and Wales 0.28 INFANTILE MORTALITY Deaths of infants under 1 year of age:- Male Female Total Legitimate 25 13 38 Illegitimate 1 — 1 26 13 39 Death Rate of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births 18.1 Death Rate of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births—legitimate 18.9 Death Rate of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births—illegitimate 6.6 Death Rate of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births, England and Wales 20.9 Deaths of infants under the age of 4 weeks:- Male Female Total Legitimate 21 9 30 Illegitimate 1 — 1 22 9 31 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births 14.37 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births, England and Wales 14. 2 7 An analysis of the causes of death and the age at the time of death reveals the following figures:— Cause of Death Age at the time of death TOTAL UNDER 1 YEAR Under 1 day 1—7 days 1—2 weeks 2—3 weeks 3 weeks to 1 month TOTAL UNDER 1 MONTH 1—3 months 3—6 months 6—9 months 9—12 months Prematurity 9 3 - - — 12 - - - - 12 Congenital defects 3 1 2 - 1 7 2 1 - 1 11 Pneumonia and Bronchitis 1 — 1 1 1 4 1 2 - - 7 Intracranial haemorrhage 3 1 — - — 4 — — - - 4 Asphyxia — — — - — — — 1 - - 1 Septicaemia — — 1 - — 1 — — - - 1 Atelectasis 2 — — - — 2 — — - - 2 Hepatic Failure — — — 1 — 1 — — - - 1 TOTAL 18 5 4 2 2 31 3 4 — 1 39 TABLE 1 The following table shows the Infantile Mortality Rates over the various years.

This is 1,643 less than the Census figure for 1961. BIRTHS The number of live births recorded during the year increased by 17, 2,156 occurring compared with 2,139 in 1962, giving an increased corrected birth rate of 13.92 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 13.62 last year. The rate is less than that for England and Wales, which is 18.2 per 1,000 Home Population. The number of stillbirths decreased from 30 to 25, giving a stillbirth rate of 11.59 per 1,000 total births compared with 13.78 in 1962. The rate for the Borough of Hendon compares favourably with that of England and Wales, which is 17.3 per 1,000 total births. DEATHS There was an increase of 55 in the number of deaths. This gives a corrected death rate of 11.32 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 11.34 in 1962. The rate for England and Wales is 12.2 per 1,000 Home Population. As in previous years, heart and associated diseases accounted for the largest number of deaths, 642 people dying from these causes. Second in the principal causes was cancer. Deaths from motor vehicle and other accidents increased, 44 people dying from these causes compared with 31 in 1962. Nineteen people committed suicide, a decrease of five on the previous year. INFANTILE MORTALITY Thirty-nine children died in the first year of life compared with 40 in 1962, giving an infantile mortality rate of 18.1 per 1,000 live births. The rate for England and Wales is 20.9 per 1,000 related live births. Of the 39 children, 31 died before reaching the age of 1 month, giving a neo-natal mortality rate of 14.37 per 1,000 live births compared with 14.2 for England and Wales. MATERNAL MORTALITY No maternal deaths occurred during the year. DEATHS FROM CANCER OF THE LUNG AND BRONCHUS During the year in Hendon 34 men and 3 women under 65 years of age died from this cause. 12 Borough of Hendon DEATHS FROM CANCER OP LUNG AND BRONCHUS DEATHS PROM RESPIRATORY TUBERCULOSIS 1951 - 1963 13 ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS The following tables show the road traffic accidents and casualties occurring within the Borough of Hendon during the year 1963 and the comparative figures for the years 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1962. It should be noted that the figures shown refer not only to Hendon residents but also to person living in other areas who were involved in accidents within the Borough. The figures for fatalities shown in these tables may not agree, therefore, with those shown in the list of causes of death supplied by the Registrar-General. The Registrar-General's figures refer to Hendon residents only, and the death may have occurred within the Borough of Hendon or outside the district.

Measles tend to occur in epidemic form every two years. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM One case of Ophthalmia Neonatorum was notified during the year, compared with two in 1962. POLIOMYELITIS No case of Poliomyelitis has occurred during the year. PUERPERAL PYREXIA There was an increase in the number of cases of Puerperal Pyrexia, 72 cases occurring compared with 39 in 1962. Of the 72 cases 34 only were Hendon residents, the remainder being women from other areas who entered the maternity hospital in the Borough for their confinement. SCARLET FEVER There was a decrease in the number of cases notified, 22 cases occurring compared with 53 in 1962. SONNE DYSENTERY There was an increase in the number of cases notified—317 compared with 13 in 1962. An outbreak of this mild disease occurred at Mill Hill School, where there are about 420 boys, of whom the majority are boarders residing in the different houses in the School. As a result of this outbreak 116 boys and 3 masters were notified as cases. The disease was very mild and the common symptoms were abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting. A noticeable feature of the outbreak was the infrequency of diarrhoea as a presenting symptom, and until the Laboratory results were obtained it was not appreciated that the epidemic was due to sonne dysentery. It was difficult to attribute the outbreak to any one set of circumstances, but school closed for the summer vacation a week later and the epidemic ceased. The remainder of the cases occurred chiefly in the Edgware and Mill Hill Districts. TYPHOID FEVER No case of Typhoid Fever has occurred during the year. PARATYPHOID FEVER B. (TYPE TAUNTON) There was one case of Paratyphoid Fever notified in Hendon. It was not possible to trace the source of this infection. Chinese bulked egg products used in the manufacture of cream pastries or cakes was responsible for a number of cases elsewhere about the same time. The introduction of the Liquid Egg (Pasteurisation) Regulations 1963 should prevent further cases from this cause. WHOOPING COUGH There were 134 cases of Whooping Cough notified as compared with 14 in 1962. 19 FOOD POISONING During the year 25 cases of food poisoning were notified compared with 29 in 1962.

The patients, who were brothers, both attended a special school in Finchley. A class-mate of the first case, who had returned from a holiday in Cyprus, was found to be a carrier of the disease, and was probably the source of the infection.

A person requiring a licence or renewal of a licence under this part of the Act must make application to the Local Authority giving certain information, such as age, nationality, technical qualifications and the nature of the establishment and the business conducted thereat. The Council considered and granted the following applications:— New Licences — Renewal of Licences 30 Certificates lodged under Section 363 by members of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy 4 Licences Refused — Section 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 NATIONAL ASSSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 This section deals with securing the necessary care and attention by removal to hospital or other place of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions and (b) are unable to devote to themselves and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. In no instance was it considered necessary to use the powers available under the Act, but nevertheless the Act is valuable in that the knowledge that the statutory power of removal exists often helps towards an effective decision. In dealing with the problem the co-operation of Mr. C. Austwick, the Area Welfare Officer, has been reatly appreciated. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 SECTION 50 — PUBLIC BURIALS Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act 1948, the Borough Council are required to arange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in their area if in such case it appears to the Council that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being made. During the year one burial was carried out. GENERAL HOSPITAL FACILITIES Edgware General Hospital. Colindale Hospital. Hendon District Hospital The needs for mental treatment are served by Napsbury Hospital. 25 INFECTIOUS DISEASES — HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION West Hendon Hospital. Neasden Isolation Hospital, Willesden. Any other Infectious Disease Hospital controlled by the North-Western Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT AND HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION Edgware General Hospital. Colindale Hospital. Admissions are normally made through the Chest Clinic, but in an emergency any chest case may be admitted to Colindale Hospital by the general practitioner phoning the hospital direct. The Chest Clinic at Edgware serves primarily those living in the Borough of Hendon and the Stanmore, Queensbury and Kingsbury districts of Harrow and Wembley. HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL The following services are provided by the Middlesex County Council under Part 111 of the National Health Service Act, 1946:— *Care of mothers and young children (Section 22) *Midwives Service (Section 23) *Health Visiting (Section 24) *Home Nursing (Section 25) *Vaccination and Immunisation (Section 26) *Chiropody Service (Section 28) *Domestic Help (Section 29) School Health Services and Dental Services (Provided under Education Act, 1944, the Borough of Hendon being an Excepted District) *These services are administered on an area basis, Area 4 consisting of the Boroughs of Hendon and Finchley. The Area Health Committee acts as a Sub-Committee of the Health Committee of the County Council and consists of representatives of the two Boroughs, Middlesex County Council, certain professional bodies and other persons with special knowledge of these services. MEDICAL PRACTITIONER SERVICE AND CLASSIFICATION OF AREAS The Middlesex Executive Committee has four classifications viz:- Designated, Open, Intermediate and Restricted Areas. The present classifications of the different wards of the Borough are as follows:— (1) Open Areas—Burnt Oak, Childs Hill, Garden Suburb, Mill Hill and West Hendon. Applications from doctors to enter practice in areas classified as Designated or Open will be granted automatically on the completion of their arrangements. (2) Intermediate Areas—Central. In the Intermediate areas the number of patients on the average general practitioner's list is reasonable. New practices may be established in such areas but the initial practice allowance is not likely to be paid. (3) Restricted Areas - Edgware, Golders Green and Park. Restricted areas are areas in which the number of doctors is adequate. Normally applications by doctors to start new practices are not granted. 26 LABORATORY FACILITIES These are provided at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. Specimens may be sent direct to the Laboratory by medical practitioners or by special collection from the Public Health Department provided they are received not later than 3. 30 p.m. Monday to Friday. STAFF MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year under review 89 new entrants or employees of the Hendon Borough Council were medically examined for superannuation purposes. Of this number 88 were passed as fit, and a decision on one other was deferred for a further six months. The number of examinations in repect of each department of the Council was as follows Town Clerk's 17 Borough Treasurer's 11 Borough Engineer's 35 Borough Librarian's 18 Borough Housing 6 Medical Officer of Health's 2 89 27 SECTION D SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLY The Borough has a dual source of supply. The northern part is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and the central and southern portion by the Metropolitan Water Board. The Colne Valley water is derived from deep wells sunk into the chalk and before distribution to the consumers the water is under constant supervision of a chemical and bacteriological staff which carries out examinations in modern laboratories situated at the works. The water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board is selected Thames water which has been subjected to purification by storage in which time it is freed of the bulk of organisms. It is filtered through rapid and then slow filters, attaining a degree of purity which compares favourably with the general supplies in Great Britain, but as a further safeguard terminal chlorination is applied which ensures a first class water in every respect. Samples of water are examined bacteriologically, chemically and for taste and other special purposes on every day. The supply to all areas was satisfactory in quality and quantity. Number of dwelling houses supplied from public water mains :— (a) Direct to houses 44,872 (b) by means of standpipes Nil Number of population supplied from public water mains :- (a) Direct to houses 150,200. (b) by means of standpipes Nil Natural fluoride content of water supplies:- Colne Valley Water Company: Fluoride content—less than 0.1 parts per million. Metropolitan Water Board: Fluoride content—0.25 parts per million. The water supplied to Hendon is deficient in fluoride and dental decay is more prevalent here than in those areas where the element is present in optimum quantity. HOUSING I am indebted to the Borough Housing Officer for the following observations on the Council's building and development progress during the year and on the housing situation generally:— In the year under review the provision of new housing accommodation centred on the completion of smaller sites found suitable for the location of Elderly Persons' Flatlets. 47 dwellings in five separate developments were completed and used to accommodate elderly single people and Council tenants no longer fully occupying the larger Council houses and flats. Progress was maintained also in assisting cases of housing need by arranging transfers and exchanges, and the re-letting of vacated premises to housing applicants. The Council have continued their policy of acquiring private properties offered to the Council for purchase in cases where elderly owners now find their dwellings too large for their needs. In these instances it has frequently been possible to assist the owners with the smaller accommodation they seek and the properties purchased have provided a useful addition to the Council's pool of family accommodation. At the close of the year the Council had over 4,600 units of permanent living accommodation and the number will be steadily added to as the Council's building schemes progress. The redevelopment of the Housing Areas at Hermitage Lane, Granville Road, and Belle Vue is well advanced and it is anticipated that the first of the new dwellings in these areas will be ready for letting in 1964. Apart from the provision of accommodation to rent, the Council has encouraged purchasers of private dwellings situated in the Borough by advances under the Council's Housing Advances Scheme and currently, some fourteen hundred housing advances have been made. The transfer of families from Hendon to the New and Expanded Towns continues to receive the active support of the Council. During 1963, 50 housing applicants were found employment in satellite towns and subsequently rehoused with their families in those areas. Certain of the longer established New Towns are now nearing completion and the diminution in the export of families to them has, to some extent, been off-set by the growth of expansion in other country towns outside of the Home Counties. 28 Although many of these are located at some distance from the Greater London area they will, in time, attract a large part of its overspill population by re-locating industries and continuing the co-operation which now exists between them, the Ministry of Labour and the Housing Departments of nearly all Greater London Boroughs. Throughout the year 530 new claims for Council tenancies were registered from families of two or more persons and a further 81 applications were recorded from single elderly persons for bedsitting-room lettings. At the 31st December 1963 the housing waiting list numbered 2,141 applications. Families assisted in the course of the year were as follows (a) Rehoused into permanent pre-war dwellings 87 (b) Rehoused into permanent post-war dwellings 110 (c) Transferred so as to resolve cases of overcrowding or underoccupation of Council dwellings. 156 PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTION The following inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors during the year:— Number of Inspections Reinspections.

The institution of legal proceedings only became necessary in the following instances:— Charge t Failure to comply with Abatement Notice served under Section 93 Public Health Act 1936 requiring repairs to house. The Magistrates ordered the Defendant to abate the nuisance within 28 days. They imposed a fine of £5 and awarded the Council £5. 5.0 costs. Failure to comply with Abatement Notice served under Section 93 Public Health Act, 1936 requiring repairs to house. The Magistrates ordered the Defendant to abate the nuisance within 28 days. They imposed a fine of £5 and awarded the Council £5. 5. 0 costs. Failure to comply with Abatement Notice served under Section 93 Public Health Act, 1936 requiring repairs to house. The Magistrates agreed to the withdrawal of the Summons as the nuisance had been abated by the time of the Hearing and awarded the Council £2.2.0 costs. 30 HOUSING Inspection of Dwelling-houses. Inspections of dwelling-houses were carried out during the year as follows:— Number of dwellings inspected at which defects were found requiring action under the Public Health Acts. 502 Number of houses surveyed for action under Housing Acts. 9 Number of houses surveyed in Housing Areas scheduled for redevelopment 76 Number of houses surveyed and reports submitted for use by District Valuer in connection with negotiations for acquisition by the Council 145 Number of houses inspected in connection with Improvement Grants Scheme 82 Total number of inspections and reinspections made 4,435 HOUSING ACT, 1957 Three houses were dealt with under the Act involving the making of two Demolition Orders and one Closing Order. As a result of this action or that taken in previous years, 13 unfit houses were demolished, and nine others were closed after the occupants had been rehoused. One part of a buildingwhich had been used as a dwelling was also closed under Section 18 of the Act. Thirteen families comprising 33 persons vacated unfit properties, the majority being rehoused by the Council. In their Circular 42/62 the Ministry of Housing and Local Government urged local authorities to select streets or areas of properties which were in reasonably good structural condition and might be expected to have a life of 20/30 years at least but which were lacking in essential amenities, i.e. indoor water closet, bath or shower in a bathroom, lavatory basin, hot water system and ventilated food cupboard. Having selected the properties these were to be visited and the owners and tenants urged to make use of the improvement grants scheme under the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959 whereby grants are made available towards the cost of the installation of these amenities. The District Public Health Inspectors were accordingly asked to prepare lists of blocks of properties suitable for dealing with under the Circular and work was commenced on visiting these with the following results— Garden City, Edgware. Cul-de-sac of 27 houses erected about 1910 without bathrooms, lavatory basins and hot water installations and with external waterclcsets. The majority of the houses are now owner/occupied. It was found that at eleven of the houses all amenities had already been installed. At the remaining sixteenoneor more of the amenities was lacking. Of these, three owners eventually made use of the Improvement Grants scheme and had the missing amenities installed. 3—21, First Avenue, N. W. 4. The survey showed that a number of the houses were without ventilated food cupboards which owners stated they did not require. Two were without internal waterclosets but the owners intimated that they were not interested in the scheme at the present time. The houses were owner/occupied. 69—107, Colindale Avenue, N. W. 9. Two blocks of terraced properties erected about 1900 without bathrooms, lavatory basins and hot water installations and with external waterclosets. Survey showed that five of the twenty houses had Iready the standard amenities. Two only of the owners have since applied for grants. IMPROVEMENT OF HOUSES 31 15—31, Birkbeck Road, N. W. 7. Block of 2 storey terraced houses built 1892 the majority being let to two tenants, one on ground floor and one on first floor. Most were without all standard amenities. The various owners were supplied with details of the grants scheme but by the end of the year none had made an application for a grant. 1—28 Creswick Walk, N. W. 11. This road was developed in 1911, the majority of the houses being built with baths in the sculleries, none with lavatory basins, and sixteen with external waterclosets. The survey showed that twenty now had all standard amenities. The tenants of the other eight intimated that they did not wish to participate in the scheme. Surveys are proceeding of properties in other roads in the Borough but the poorresults ofthe Department's efforts makes one wonder whether the time spent is justified. The measure of compulsion available to tenants under the Housing Bill at present before Parliament may, however, render continuance of the work of trying to secure improvement of houses by persuasion of tenants and owners unnecessary. UNFIT HOUSES MADE FIT AND HOUSES IN WHICH DEFECTS WERE REMEDIED The following are the numbers of houses made fit or at which defects were remedied as a result of action taken— After informal action 406 After formal action under the Public Health 90 or Housing Acts. HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION HOUSING ACT, 1961 During the year inspections were carried out of 136 houses (comprising 335 lettings) let in multiple occupation. 123 of these were in the Housing Areas scheduled for redevelopment. Negotiations have been commenced for the acquisition of the majority of these by the Council and it is hoped that similar action will not be long delayed regarding the remainder. Wherever possible the Department refrains from taking action to enforce the provisions of the Housing Act, 1961 to bring these houses up to proper standard of amenities and repair as this would only increase the cost to the Council when the time comes for their ultimate acquisition and demolition to make way for the redevelopment. On the other hand, if they are not purchased in the near future they will deteriorate and tend to become overcrowded and eventually increase the problems of the Housing Officer. Moreover it is unfair that the tenants should be allowed to continue to live in unsatisfactory housing conditions. Of the 13 houses dealt with not in Housing Areas, six ceased to be used for multiple occupation as a result of action taken. In some instances this was in conjunction with that taken by the Town Planning Department. One house has now been properly converted to self contained flats, and appropriate steps are being taken to bring the other six into compliance with the Act. A considerable amount of work remains to be done to enforce the provisions of this Act in Hendon and to improve the lot of those families who are compelled, by reason of the housing shortage, to live in what can only be regarded as sub-standard accommodation despite the provision of additional amenities, proper means of escape from fire and reduced overcrowding. Oddly enough, few complaints are received from the families who are forced to live in these unsatisfactory conditions. Much more vociferous are the complaints of owners of adjoining properties when a house is found to be let off in multiple occupation in one of the more salubrious residential roads. The work of dealing with these houses is at times very difficult and arduous, necessitating frequent visits at night or week-ends to complete inspections, dealing with difficult and sometimes elusive landlords, and placating tenants, who, whilst appreciative of the installation of baths, hot water supplies, additional water closets, proper larders, etc., are nevertheless fearful of eviction to make way for the amenities or of increased rents to help pay for them. The work is, however, of utmost importance and must be speeded up. 32 OVERCROWDING The following statement gives details of the known cases of overcrowding existing or dealt with during the year, the standard of overcrowding being that detailed in the Housing Act, 1957. Dwellings Families Persons Number at 31st December, 1962 10 12 64 Number of new cases during the year 4 4 20 Number of cases relieved during the year 7 9 39 Number at 31st December, 1963 7 7 45 It is very unlikely that the above represents the entire extent of overcrowding in the Borough but were the only cases known to the Department. The present overcro wding standard is the one laid down in the Housing Act 1935 and re-enacted in the present Act. The fact that a husband and wife and baby under 12 months old can still live and sleep in a room 11 ft x 10 ft. without being statutorily overcrowded makes one wonder whether the time has not arrived for a revision of the standard. COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no registered common lodging houses in the Borough. RENT ACT, 1957 The following figures show the number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair and Revocation received and the action taken during the year. Application for Certificates of Disrepair. Number of applications for certificates 4 Number of decisions not to issue certificates — Number of decisions to issue certificates (a) in respect of some but not all defects 2 (b) in respect of all defects 1 Number of applications outstanding at end of year 1 Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 3 Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority — Number of certificates issued — Applications for Cancellation of Certificates Number of applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates 2 Number of objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 1 Number of decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objections — Number of certificates cancelled by Local Authority 1 33 CARAVANS CARAVAN SITES AND CONTROL OF DEVELOPMENT ACT, 1960. There is now only one licensed caravan site in the Borough. This is at a site at Brockley Hill, Stanmore and is for one caravan only. Inspections showed that the conditions attached to the licence were being observed. A site at Brent Park Road. N. W. 9. is used only for winter quarters by members of the Showman's Guild of Great Britain and so is exempt from the provisions of the Act relating to site licences. Action also had to be taken from time to time to deal with the caravans parked on the grass verges of the North Circular Road, N. W. 2. or on land in the vicinity. The owners of the caravans are usually engaged in scrap metal dealing and car breaking and leave accumulations of unwanted rubbish behind. The caravans are also without sanitary accommodation with the result that the surrounding area is often left in a disgusting condition. In all, 42 caravans had to be "moved on" from this area during the year. Six caravans also parked on land or greenswards in the Edgware area and had to be dealt with similarly. Legal proceedings were instituted under Section 345 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944 against the occupier of a caravan for placing it on land at Brockley Grange Farm, Edgware without the previous consent of the Council. The defendant was fined 20/-. The caravan was moved four days before the hearing. The owner of the farm was also cautioned later in the year for allowing land to be used for camping purposes. This was discontinued. Towards the end of the year, 26 caravans moved on to a site at Stonegrove, Edgware. Summonses were issued by the Council under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 and the Middlesex County Council Act 1944 and the owners of the land also issued a writ claiming an injunction. As a result of the latter the site was vacated and the Council's summonses were accordingly not proceeded with. DRAIN TESTS AND DRAINAGE WORK Tests of drainage systems and examination of sanitary fitments were carried out and reports submitted thereon during the year as follows:— For prospective purchasers of properties 13 In connection with applications for advances under the Housing (F.P.) Act, 1958 147 Fees are paid to the Council for this work. As a result of the above sanitary surveys the following works were carried out under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors. Main drains relaid or repaired 44 Branch drains relaid or repaired 128 Manholes reconstructed or repaired 143 Soil ventilating pipes renewed or repaired 79 Fresh air inlets renewed, repaired or removed 41 Sanitary fitments renewed or repaired 50 Gutters or rainwater pipes renewed or repaired 44 Gullies or gully surrounds renewed or repaired 86 Waste-pipes renewed or repaired 26 1589 visits were made to drainage and plumbing works in progress during the year. CLEARANCE OF BLOCKED DRAINS The Council continues to operate its service for the clearing of drains at private premises, where this can be done by rodding or plunging, on request by the owner or occupier. The charges for this work are as follows:— During normal working hours 15. 0d. Evenings — Monday to Friday £1. 10. 0d. At week-ends £3. 0. 0d. 1205 drains were cleared under this arrangement during the year. Of these 1132 were cleared during normal working hours, three in an evening and 70 at week-ends. 34 In addition, 149 choked drains were cleared as follows:- By private contractors after verbal notice to owners or occupiers 79 By private contractors after service of notices under Section 96, Hendon Urban District Council Act, 1929 on owners or occupiers 14 By the Council in default of compliance with notices served as above, the cost being later recovered from the persons on whom the 56 notices were served. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL The Ministry of Health have requested that the Annual Report for the year 1963 should include a section dealing with the sewerage and sewage disposal arrangements for the Borough. W ith the assistance of information supplied by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor I accordingly have to report as follows Soil Drainage The major part of the Borough is sewered by gravity sewers of adequate capacity with the exception of the Hendon Way soil sewer which carries surface water drainage from old development in the Childs Hill area. Redevelopment of these parts is. however, now in progress and separate surface water drainage is being provided for this. This will ameliorate to a great extent the surcharging of the Hendon Way sewer. The main trunk soil sewers discharge into the West Middlesex Trunk sewer with its outfall at Mogden, Middlesex. Parts of Mill Hill, Elstree and Barnet Gate do, however, remain unsewered, 147 properties being served by cesspools or small septic tank sewage disposal installations. Work proceeded during the year on the new soil sewer to serve the Burton Hole Lane, N.W.7. area. This will permit the number of cesspools to be reduced by 32 and should considerably reduce the pollution of the Folly Brook which occurs from time to time. Discussions also took place with officials of Barnet Urban District Council regarding the possibility of extending the sewer recently constructed by that Council with a view to connecting up properties in the Hendon Wood Lane and Barnet Gate areas at present served by cesspools or septic tank installations. During the year 321 requests for the emptying of cesspools or septic tanks were complied with, the work, in most instances, being carried out at the expense of the Council. Surface Water Drainage. The surface water drainage of the Borough is carried by public surface water sewers and open watercourses into the River Brent and the Dollis Brook which discharge into the Brent Reservoir. In 1956, a comprehensive report was submitted by the Borough Engineer & Surveyor to the Council on schemes which were considered necessary to deal with flood relief, and by the end of 1963 the following schemes had been completed or were in course of construction— Un-named stream from Edgwarebury to confluence with Deans Brook— Culverting watercourse Edgware Way to Ranelagh Drive Relief sewer Hale Lane to Penshurst Gardens Relief sewer Purcells Avenue to Edgwarebury Lane Uphill Road Area, N. W. 7.— Relief sewer in Uphill Road to Edgware Way Un-named stream from Uphill Grove to confluence with Silk Stream— Mill Hill Broadway across Bunns Lane to Langley Park to railway line (Edgware-Mill Hill East) Flower Lane relief sewer from Watford Way Copthall Estate, N.W. 7.— Relief sewer Bunns Lane under railway rear of Nos. 51 and 53, Bunns Lane. Mill Hill East, N.W.7.— Surface water sewers from bridge in Bittacy Hill to Holders Hill Circus thence along Dollis Road to discharge into Dollis Brook. Woodside Park Area, N.12.— Relief sewer in Chanctonbury Way. Mutton Brook, N.W.11.— Relief sewer in Chatham Close, Erskine Hill and Addison Way Basing Hill, N.W.11.— Relief sewer in Basing Hill and Wayside 35 As a result of flooding which took place in June 1963 an investigation is being carried out with a view to preparing a scheme for alleviating flooding in the Dollis valley drainage area at Mill Hill East. During the course of their inspections of properties, the Public Health Inspectors are constantly on the look-out for incorrect connections of wastepipes from sinks and lavatory basins to surface water drainage systems which lead to pollution of the watercourses. During the year 23 such connections were found and dealt with either by having fitments removed or by having the waste-pipes diverted to the soil drainage system. LOCAL LAND CHARGES ENQUIRIES During the year, enquiries were received from the Town Clerk in respect of 3814 properties. These related to any action being taken under the Public Health, Housing and Rent Acts, inclusion in Smoke Control Areas and in Housing Areas (areas scheduled for redevelopment). The necessary enquiries or inspections were made and the information supplied. SCAVENGING OF PRIVATE PASSAGES AND ACCOMMODATION ROADS'- During the year it was necessary for 321 visits to be paid by the Public Health Inspectors to private passages running at the rear of houses and to accommodation roads in connection with complaints as to their unscavenged condition. Very few of these passages and roads have been taken over by the Council, paved and made highways maintainable at public expense. The scavenging of the great majority therefore remains the responsibility under the Public Health Act, 1936, of the occupiers of the premises to which the passages etc. afford access. In eleven instances the efforts of the Public Health Inspectors to secure scavenging by verbal and written intimations w ere unsuccessful and it became necessary for the Council to carry out the work in default and to proceed to recover the cost from the occupiers of the premises concerned. I would again draw attention to the difficulty which arises in attempting to deal with obstructions which occur in the usually three feet wide passages between the rear gardens of houses which are used by the refuse collectors for the removal of refuse from the houses. Neglected fences are sometimes allowed to to lean or collapse over the passages, or trees to overhang, so obstructing the refuse collectors in their work, sometimes to an extent that the use of the passage has to be discontinued and refuse collection made from the front of the houses through which the full bins have to be carried by the householders. Much is done informally by the Public Health Inspectors to deal with the owners of the fences and trees but there does not appear to be any satisfactory statutory power under the Public Health Acts to require them to keep the passages unobstructed. I can only re-iterate that, in my opinion, the only satisfactory method of dealing with this problem of private passages and accommodation roads is the making of them up under Part IX of the Highways Act, 1959 and their subsequent maintenance and scavenging by the Council. PEST AND VERMIN CONTROL During the year, 476 inspections and 247 reinspections were made of premises by the District Public Health Inspectors to inspect for or give advice on a wide variety of insect pests. Although many of the insects found have no public health significance the service is one which is greatly appreciated byhouse wives who frequently become alarmed at the presence of the intruders and at a loss to know their significance or how to deal with them. The incidence of vermin (bugs, fleas and lice) is now very low only ten infestations having to be dealt with. Disinfestation is carried out by one of the Council's rodent operatives who has been trained in the work. Wasps nests are also destroyed free of charge, 263 being dealt with during the year. Routine inspections of the effects of new Council tenants are also carried out prior ro their removal into their new accommodation, but it is now only very occasionally that any evidence of vermin is found. In these cases the necessary disinfestation is carried out before removal takes place. 264 inspections were made during the year. As a result of action taken in 1962 to reduce the number of pigeons roosting under railway bridges etc., fewer complaints were received regarding these. One roof turret and one roof were dealt with by requesting the owners of the properties to board them up to prevent the pigeons entering. This was done and the nuisances abated. 36 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 — RODENT CONTROL Rodent control at dwelling houses and business premises is carried out by a foreman, three wholetime and one part-time operatives working under the supervision of the District Public Health Inspectors and in accordance with recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The foreman and operatives attend refresher courses arranged by the Ministry from time to time to ensure that they are properly aware of the latest methods and poisons, etc., in use. Treatment of sewers is carried out by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department. A few instances occurred of rats breaking out from sewers via the rodding arms of intercepting traps and defective fresh air inlet heads on the drainage systems of houses. The necessary repairs to the drains were carried out by the householders and the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department advised so that disinfestation work could be carried out in the sewers. In the case of dwelling houses, treatment is undertaken by the Council free of charge. In the case of business premises, a charge based upon time, cost of materials and overhead expenses, is made. An estimate of the cost is prepared and submitted to the occupier of the business premises and it is open to him either to accept it, engage a private specialist firm or undertake the work himself. Almost invariably the Council's estimate is accepted. Should an occupier elect to do the work himself, the District Public Health Inspector ensures that the treatment is successfully carried out. The Public Health Inspectors also took steps to deal with the following either under the Public Health Act, 1936 or the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. In all cases the necessary clearance or works were carried out after the service of informal or statutory notices. Accumulations of rubbish and discarded materials 151 Overgrown land 6 Rat-proofing of buildings 17 All of the rat infestations were by the Common (brown) rat. Ship(black) rats have not been found in the Borough for several years. Details of the work carried out during the year, in the form required by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, is set out in appendix 11. An infestation is considered to be a "major" when more than 20 bodies are picked upafter treatment. DISINFECTION Disinfection of rooms by the use of formalin spray is carried out after the incidence of certain notifiable infectious diseases and in the case of tubercuiosis, when considered necessary by the Chest Physician. Bedding, clothing and library books are disinfected by arrangement with Finchley Borough Council at that Council's disinfecting station at North Circular Road, N. 3. During the year the following were dealt with:— Rooms 32 Bedding and/or clothing 135 Library books 68 Parcels of clothing to be sent abroad 34 The parcels of clothing being sent abroad are required by the Governments of some countries to be accompanied by a certificate of the local authority that they have been disinfected before dispatch. DOMICILIARY LAUNDRY SERVICE. A problem which arises in the case of aged and sick persons in their own homes, is the cleansing and laundering of soiled linen and clothing. Where such persons have no relative living with them who is able to deal with the articles, assistance is given under Section 84, Public Health Act, 1936 as amended by Section 42, Middlesex County Council Act, 1956. These sections give the Council necessary authority to have the articles collected and cleansed (laundered.) During the year 13,240 articles were collected from the houses of 38 such incontinent persons. The articles are collected twice weekly and returned to them after laundering. The scheme frequently enables these people to remain in their homes instead of having to occupy beds in hospitals which can therefore be put to more urgent and better use. The introduction of the Ministry of Health's scheme in 1964 for the supply of incontinence pads to patients being nursed at home may reduce the need for the laundry service 37 FACTORIES ACT, 1961 At the request of the Ministry of Health the tables showing the work carried out in the administration of the health provisions of the Factories Acts, are given in the prescribed form as an annex to the report. Theoccupiersof factories are required to supply the Local Authcrity twice yearly with lists of the names and addresses of persons employed by them as outworkers, i.e, carrying out work in their own homes. The lists are submitted in February and August. The homes are then inspected by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that conditions there are suitable. Twenty-six lists were received from employers in the Borough giving details of 153 outworkers. Of these 98 did not reside in the Borough and the appropriate details were forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts concerned. In turn, notifications were received from other local authorities of 108 outworkers residing in Hendon but employed in factories elsewhere. The homes of all the outworkers were inspected but in one instance only were conditions unsatis factory, the room in which the work was carried out requiring cleansing and redecoration. Appropriate action was taken. In factories where no mechanical power is used in the process involved, the Local Authority is responsible for seeing that proper cleanliness is maintained, that there is no overcrowding of employees, that ventilation is adequate, that a reasonable temperature is maintained, (one or more thermometers has to be provided in each room), that floors are properly drained if any wet proce s is carried on and that suitable & sufficient sanitary conveniences are maintained. There were sixteen such factories in the Borough at the end of the year. At four of these, matters relating to redecoration, absence of thermometers and failure to display notices were found to require attention. All were satisfactorily dealt with, At factories where mechanical power is used in the processes involved, the Local Authority is only responsible for seeing that suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences are maintained. At 24 of the factories inspected works were found to be necessary. Appropriate notices were served and the defects remedied or in hand at the end of the year. PREMISES LICENSED FOR PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT In accordance with the usual annual procedure, inspections were made at the request of the Middlesex County Council of the sanitary conveniences, kitchens, etc., at hotels, Church halls, cinemas, restaurants, etc., licensed for public entertainment. Forty-five premises were inspected. At thirty-three premises conditions were found to be satisfactorv. At the other twelve the following matters were found requiring attention:— Sanitary Conveniences Repairs 15 Cleansing 4 Redecoration 15 Kitchens Repair or renewal of equipment 3 Cleansing 2 Other Rooms, Passages, etc. Repairs 1 Cleansing 1 Redecoration 1 All these matters were satisfactorily dealt with. 38 HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS 152 visits were paid to hairdressing establishments during the year to ensure that the requirements of the Council's Byelaws were being complied with. As a result of the inspections the following works were carried out:— Saloons redecorated 3 Wash basins renewed 2 General repairs executed 3 Floor or floor coverings repaired or renewed 3 Sanitary conveniences repaired 10 Sanitary conveniences redecorated 10 Drains cleared 6 Yards cleared of rubbish 7 Additional refuse receptacles provided 1 General cleanliness improved 2 Cleansing of equipment improved 1 Copies of Byelaws exhibited 3 RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERALS ACT, 1951 This Act and Regulations made thereunder prescribe standards of cleanliness for each of certain specified filling materials used in the manufacture of furniture, prams, toys, etc. Premises at which the work is carried out are required to be registered with the Local Authority and records have to be kept showing the amounts etc., of the filling materials used. Five premises are registered with the Council. No contravention of the Act or Regulations was noted during the year. SWIMMING BATHS There are two municipal-owned open air swimming pools (one at Mill Hill and one at West Hendon) and an open air teaching swimming pool at Broadfields Junior School. Samples of swimming bath water were taken during the summer months and submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratory for bacteriological examination. The following are the results of the samples— No. taken Results Mill Hill Swimming Bath 12 12 satisfactory West Hendon Swimming Bath 6 6 satisfactory Broadfields Junior School Swimming Pool 3 3 unsatisfactory The pool at Broadfields School was only open for a very short period before the summer vacation and there was not an opportunity to take repeat samples, before it closed. Attendances at the two municipal-owned baths during the opening season were as follows:— Mill Hill Swimming Pool Month Adults Children Season Ticket Holders May 300 3,390 650 June 6,829 21,908 2,332 July 2,803 13,247 1,812 August 4,430 16,701 1,626 September 457 2,258 317 Total 14,819 57,504 6,737 39 West Hendon Swimming Pool Month Adults Children Season Ticket Holders May 53 515 143 June 2,820 5,735 755 July 778 3,799 496 August 1,909 5,442 641 September 120 741 102 Total 5,680 16,232 2,137 School children under instruction Mill Hill Pool 12,496 West Hendon Pool 6,880 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 Eleven applications were received for the renewal of licences to keep pet shops. The "animals" kept included puppies, kittens, hampsters, guinea-pigs, rabbits, birds, mice, fish and reptiles. The premises were inspected for adequacy of means of ventilation, natural and artificial lighting, water supply, state of repair and cleanliness, arrangements for storage of food, hay and straw, disposal of excreta, adequacy of fire fighting equipment, and availability of some person with key to premises to be called in case of emergency when premises closed, and exhibition of suitable notice on door or window giving name and address of such person. At seven of the premises conditions were found to be satisfactory. At the other four matters relating to the resiting of a fire extinguisher, display of notice of person holding key, cleansing, provision of hot water supply and general repairs were found to require attention. These were all satisfactorily dealt with and all applications fcr licences were granted. The opportunity was also taken to check on fresh meat on sale in these shops. Such meat, if from a knacker's yard, must have been sterilised or be stained with an approved green dye. In each case it was found, however, that the fresh meat on sale was either horse flesh fit for human consumption coming from slaughterhouses where the carcases had been properly inspected and passed as fit for human consumption by a Public Health Inspector, or frozen horseflesh imported from abroad and accompanied by a Veterinary Certificate approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1939 The riding establishments are inspected biannually by the Council's Veterinary Officer. On each occasion during 1963 six establishments having some 70 horses and 6 donkeys were inspected. The Veterinary Officer reported adversely on one establishment as a result of which improvements to the stables were carried out. The other premises and all of the animals were found to be in satisfactory condition. AGRICULTURE (SAFETY, HEALTH & WELFARE PROVISIONS) ACT, 1956 Inspections were made during the year of the thirteen farms and other agricultural or horticultural premises in the Borough to ensure that the requirements of the Act relating to the provision and maintenance of suitable sanitary conveniences for the use of the workers, were being complied with. At four premises works of cleansing, redecoration or repair were found to be necessary. The appropriate notices were served and the works executed. At the other nine premises conditions were found to be satisfactory. 40 DISEASE OF ANIMALS ACTS FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE No outbreaks of this disease occurred in the Country during the year — the first time for several years. SWINE FEVER The Swine Fever Order, 1963, which came into operation on the 11th March, 1963, introduced a new policy for dealing with outbreaks of swine fever in an endeavour to eradicate this disease in Britain. Not only all pigs affected with the disease but also all those on the premises which have been in contact are now to be slaughtered and their carcases cremated or buried. Compensation is paid at full value for pigs slaughtered which show no signs of swine fever and at half value for pigs which are diseased at the time of slaughter. New restrictions were also introduced on the movement of animals, foodstuffs, equipment, etc. Infected premises must also remain unstocked for a period of not less than fourteen days after cleansing and disinfection. A suspected outbreak occurred at the piggeries at the Refuse Disposal Works and the Piggeries were placed in quarantine. The affected animals were, however, later diagnosed by the Veterinary Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foods to be suffering from "diamonds" (nettlerash). An outbreak of swine fever occurred in another part of Middlesex as a result of which movement restrictions were imposed throughout the whole of the County from 23rd March to 7th June, 1963. FOWL PEST As from 1st April. 1963 the Fowl Pest (Amendment) Order, 1963 came into operation. This put an end to the policy which hitherto had been practised of slaughtering compulsorily all poultry at premises at which the disease occurred. In future, the premises will be placed under restriction and this restriction may also be extended to neighbouring flocks particularly if the poultry have not been vaccinated against the disease. Vaccine at subsidised prices has been available to poultry keepers from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food since November, 1962 and it is now, more than ever, necessary for them to take full advantage of the scheme. No cases or suspected cases of the disease occurred in the Borough during the year nor was it necessary for any restriction on movement to be imposed. THE MOVEMENT OF ANIMALS (RECORDS) ORDERS, 1960 & 1961 Detailed records have to be kept by stockholders of the movement of bovines, sheep, goats and pigs to and from their premises. These records are necessary so that in the event of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth and other infectious diseases investigations can be made at the premises from which any animals have recently been received. Animals which have left the premises can also be traced and kept under observation. All stockholders were visited during the year to ensure that the proper records were being kept The records showed that the following stock was held in the Borougn:— Pigs Bovines 505 364 One pig club closed down during the year. DISEASES OF ANIMALS (WASTE FOOD) ORDER, 1957 Once again during the year the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food drew attention to the need for the proper handling of waste foods and swill to minimise the risk of spread of animal diseases. Although the country had been free from foot-and-mouth disease for some months the prevalence of swine fever and fowl pest continued to cause serious concern. Numbers of outbreaks of these diseases had been caused by the animals or poultry gaining access either to raw foodstuffs or to the waste which had not been properly boiled. The Diseases of Animals (Waste Food) Order, 1957 prohibits the feeding of unboiled waste food to farm animals and poultry and requires that all such food shall be boiled for at least one hour in plant licensed by the Local Authority. Ten licences were originally issued under the Order but only five plants now remain in use. These are all visited by the Public Health Inspectors from time to time to ensure that the licence conditions are being complied with. 41 IMPORTATION OF DOGS AND CATS ORDER, 1928 There is an establishment at Mill Hill licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and used for the detention and isolation of imported dogs undergoing quarantine. The establishment is run by veterinary surgeons and is licensed for the detention of 35 dogs at any one time. During the year, 108 dogs were received at the premises after being authorised to land in this country. The dogs are kept strictly isolated from all other dogs during the six months period of quarantine. The premises are kept under observation by the Police and the Council's Diseases of Animal Inspector to check on the presence and isolation of the dogs. As a result of careful and strict observance of the Importation Order, no rabies has been confirmed in this country since 1922. RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES The Radioactive Substances Act, 1960 which came into force during the year is designed to secure that the scale on which radioactive materials are used, and the method of use, is properly controlled and that any waste arising from such use is disposed of in such a way as to prevent any hazard to public health. Users of radioactive materials are required to register their premises with the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and no disposal of radioactive waste is permitted except in accordance with conditions embodied in a certificate of authorisation issued by the Minister after inspection by a radiochemical inspector. The limitations and conditions imposed by certificates of registration and authorisation are enforced by the Minister and local authorities have no responsibility in the matter. Copies of certificates are however sent to local authorities concerned for information. There are five registered users of radioactive materials in the Borough, two of whom have been granted certificates of authorisation for disposal of waste. The Minister has power under the Act to arrange for disposal of solid waste through local authority services as necessary. Authorisations have been granted to two London hospitals and a local institute of medical research to dispose of certain radioactive substances by incineration at the Councils' destructor works. Disposal is subject to the exacting conditions specified in the Authorisation and is undertaken by the Radiological Protection Service whose operatives place the waste in the destructor. 42 SECTION E FOOD ADMINISTRATION INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 The following table classifies the various premises in the Borough at which food is manufactured, prepared or sold, and shows the number of inspections and re-inspections made by the Public Health Inspectors. Premises Inspections Reinspections Bakehouses 23 27 41 Bakers and Confectioners 46 44 27 Butchers 99 117 177 Confectioners (Sweets) 155 38 31 Dairies and Milk Distributors 53 15 2 Fishmongers 24 19 31 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 100 102 126 Grocers and Provisions Merchants 168 360 396 Hawkers' Storage Premises 8 30 8 Hotels, Restaurants and Cafes 135 281 350 Ice Cream—Premises registered for manufacture or sale 267 166 126 Licensed premises 47 122 129 Preserved Foods—Premises registered for (a) Preparation of Sausages 12) (b) Brining of Meat 95) 90 51 (c) Frying of Fish 11) School Meals Kitchens and Centres 52 18 8 Works Canteens 49 40 15 WORKS AND IMPROVEMENTS CARRIED OUT During the year the following works, etc. were carried out at the above-mentioned premises in response to notices served or requests made verbally by the Public Health Inspectors. The institution of legal proceedings for failure to comply with the Act or Regulations did not become necessary during the year. Decoration of Shops, Storerooms, etc. 119 General repairs 45 Floor finishes or coverings renewed 31 Ventilation improved 8 Sanitary accommodation Repairs 48 Redecoration 56 Cleansing 11 "Now Wash Your Hands" notices displayed 47 Personal washing facilities improved 72 Refuse bins renewed 27 Drains repaired or cleared 20 Refrigerators repaired or adjusted 28 Equipment renewed 40 Protection provided for food on display 36 First Aid materials renewed 37 Lockers provided for outdoor clothing 15 Accumulations of rubbish removed 30 Vermin infestations dealt with 4 Dirty conditions improved 24 43 NEW PREMISES An arrangement exists whereby all plans deposited with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor for new food premises or for alterations to existing premises are passed to the Chief Public Health Inspector for his observations in connection with the enactments which will apply when the premises become occupied. This co-operation has resulted in many improvements in design, lay-out and equipment being incorporated in the work, so raising the general standard of hygiene at the premises and avoiding the possible necessity of the Public Health Inspector having to ask for additional works or the provision of additional equipment etc. when the premises have come into use and subject to the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations. The arrangement is welcomed by the shop keepers and their Architects, the Public Health Inspectors as a result of their experience in dealing with the different types of food premises, often being in a position to make recommendations which not only improve the standard of hygiene but also give better working conditions at the premises. COMPLAINTS OF FOREIGN MATTER IN FOOD Thirteen complaints were made to the Department during the year and below are details of the action taken Complaint Action taken Selling loaf containing small piece of sponge Investigation showed that a sponge had been used in washing down the walls of the bakehouse and that a small fragment had broken off and entered the bread. In view of the previous good record of the baker a warning letter only was sent. Selling a fish cake containing a fish parasite The parasite inhabits the flesh of round fish and it would have been extremely difficult for the manufacturers to detect its presence. It is harmless to man. In the circumstances the case was dealt with by a warning letter to the manufacturers. Selling milk containing vegetable matter Particles of vegetable debris were found in the cream layer of a bottle of school milk. The bottle was rather loosely capped and the possibility of it having been tampered with at the school could not be excluded. In the circumstances the matter was dealt with by the sending of a warning letter to the Dairy Company. Selling malt loaf containing small stone The stone was of a kind not uncommonly found in consignments of dried fruit. In view of the recent good record of the bakers the matter was dealt with by the sending of a warning letter. Selling sweets which were shop soiled Half a pound of wrapped sweets were sold but one or two had become detached from their wrappings and one of these was soiled. No previous complaints had been received regarding the retailer and as he undertook a more rigid inspection of the sweets on sale the matter was dealt with by the issue of a warning letter. Selling bottle of milk containing spots of machine oil and /or grease Legal proceedings were instituted against the distributors of the milk who were fined £10 and the Council awarded £5. 5. 0 costs. Selling loaf of bread containing discoloured dough The fragment of dough, which was small, was reported by the Analyst to contain vegetable oil. Although aesthetically unpleasant the dough was harmless. As the bakers had a previous good record the matter was dealt with by the sending of a warning letter. 44 Selling tin of strawberries containing moth. The strawberries were produced and packed in Holland. The importers were advised and sent a director to Holland to investigate who reported that more vigilant control and supervision were to be exercised at the factory. As the importers and the retailer could not possibly have known of the presence of the moth in the tin the matter was dealt with by the issue of warning letters. Selling puff pastry containing mould spots As the pastry was not brought to the Department until three days after purchase if was difficult to assess its condition at the time of sale. A warning letter was sent to the retailers. Selling a sausage containing a large bristle Legal proceedings were taken against the manufacturers who were fined £10 and the Council awarded £5. 5. 0. costs. Selling a half pound packet of butter containing a flying insect The butter was produced and packed in Denmark. It would have been impossible to detect the presence of the insect as the butter was wrapped in aluminium foil and greaseproof paper. As proceedings against the Danish producers were impossible, a warning letter was sent to the importers. Selling sliced and wrapped loaf containing hard dough. This was found to be due to cottonseed oil which would not have been harmful. The matter was accordingly dealt with by the issue of a warning letter to the manufacturers. Selling frozen chicken fritters containing mould growth The fritters were not seen by the Public Health Inspector until 23 hours after purchase and had been kept after sale in conditions favourable to the growth of mould. In the circumstances the matter was dealt with by the issue of a warning letter to the retailers. Selling sausages as part of a meal the sausages being sour and fermenting The sausages were said to have been served to three members of the staff of a Company at the Company's canteen. The Council decided to take legal proceedings against the Company under Section 8 of the Act but as none of the complainants would even come forward later to make a statement, no further action could be taken. Selling a doughnut containing a piece of metal The manufacturers denied that the metal was in the doughnut when sold and the possibility of the contaminant entering the doughnut after sale could not be discounted. The Town Clerk was not satisfied as to the evidence and no further action was taken. CONDEMNED FOODS A list of the foodstuffs condemned by the Public Health Inspectors during the year as unfit for human consumption is given below. It is rarely nowadays that an inspector finds unsound food displayed or intended for sale. All of the food detailed below was condemned as a result of requests received from retailers to inspect the food which had become unfit from such causes as breakdown of refrigerators at week-ends or delay or damage in transit. Condemned foods are destroyed by incineration at the Council's Refuse Disposal Works. 45 LIST OF FOODSTUFFS CONDEMNED DURING 1963 Meat 1415 lbs. (Beef, Chicken, Cooked Ham, Ducks, Lamb, Offal, Pork, Turkey and Veal) Tinned Foods Fish 81 Fruit 738 Fruit Juice 43 Ham 17 (112 lbs. 12 ozs.)

Ice cream 85 packs MILK AND DAIRIES (GENERAL) REGULATIONS The large milk bottling establishment at Claremont Road, N.W.2. was frequently inspected during the year and 110 bottles were taken at random from the bottle-washing machines after having been subjected to the washing and sterilising processes. The bottles were subjected to bacteriological examination with the following results:— Satisfactory 100 Unsatisfactory 10 46 The unsatisfactory samples were investigated and found to be apparently due to the necessary high temperatures not being maintained in one washing machine. Baffles were designed and fitted to overcome this with the result that subsequent samples were very satisfactory. During the year three complaints of bottles not having been "in a proper state of thorough cleanliness" before being filled with milk were dealt with. One complaint referred to dark staining on the inside of the bottle delivered to a customer in Hendon but bottled outside the Borough. The complaint was referred to the local authority in whose area the bottling estblishment was situated who decided to take no action in the matter. A second complaint referred to some very small traces of mortar on the inside of a bottle. The matter was considered by the Public Health Committee and it was decided to send a warning letter to the Dairy Company concerned. The third related to a bottle of school milk which contained hardened cement on the bottom. It was considered that the cement should have been seen by the scrutineer on the milk bottling machine and legal proceedings were taken against the Dairy Company. A fine of £10 was imposed and the Council awarded £6.6.0. costs. Taking into account the vast number of bottles of milk delivered in the Borough in the course of a year the number of complaints received was extremely small. During the year six new registrations were made of distributors of milk from retail premises and two were removed from the register, the sale of milk having been discontinued. The total number of registered premises at the end of the year was accordingly 53, eleven being depots from which milk is distributed by roundsmen and 42 being retail shops. No matters of importance were found requiring attention at these during the year. Routine sampling of milk is now carried out by Middlesex County Council. ICE CREAM At the end of the year there were 267 premises registered for the sale or manufacture of ice cream. Twenty seven new registrations were made during the year, five registrations were transferred to new occupiers and five registrations were revoked, the sale of ice cream having been discontinued. Ice cream is also sold at several hotels, restaurants and cinemas. These premises are not subject to registration. 126 samples of ice cream were taken and submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratory Service for bacteriological examination and grading according to the Ministry of Health's Provisional Grading Scheme, with the following results:— Grades 1 and 2 are satisfactory. Grade 3 calls for investigation of the methods of production and/or handling. Grade 4 is unsatisfactorv. Number of Samples taken Results Prepacked 45 Grade 1 5 Grade 2 1 Grade 3 Ice Lollies 3 Grade 1 Loose 34 Grade 1 12 Grade 2 7 Grade 3 7 Grade 4 Soft Ice 6 Grade 1 1 Grade 2 2 Grade 3 3 Grade 4 As in previous years, it was found that the bacteriological standard of prepacked ice cream and of ice lollies is usually very high but that constant vigilance is required to maintain loose ice cream at a proper standard Whenever unsatisfactory sample results are received thorough investigation is necessary at all stages from manufacturer to consumer to check where contamination or unsatisfactory storage is taking place and to remedy it. Repeat samples are taken until a satisfactory standard is obtained and maintained. Soft ice is made at a few retail premises in the Borough but the bulk of the ice cream sold in the area is manufactured elsewhere. 47 FRESH CREAM CAKES Forty samples of fresh cream cakes or of whipping cream to be used in the preparation of these cakes were taken for bacteriological examination. Of these an unexpectedly high proportion (24 samples), was found to have undesirably high bacterial content. In some cases the cream, which was checked on delivery to the premises, was found to have this high bacterial count on arrival. The matter was taken up with the suppliers. In others, lack of proper care and attention in the use and sterilising of the cream dispensers was found to be the cause. Instruction in this was given by the Public Health Inspectors and supervision maintained until satisfactory results were obtained. PREMISES REGISTERED FOR PREPARATION OR MANUFACTURE OF SAUSAGES OR POTTED, PRESSED, PICKLED OR PRESERVED FOOD INTENDED FOR SALE At the end of the year 127 premises were registered for the following purposes Brining of meat 95 Boiling of Hams 13 Cooking and/or pressing of Meat 6 Preparation of Sausages 12 Preparation of "Hot Dogs" 1 Roasting of Chickens 11 Preparation of Meat Pies 1 Frying of Fish 4 Curing of Fish 4 (Some premises are registered for more than one purpose) Thirty-one new registrations were made during the year. 141 visits were paid to these premises when only minor matters were found requiring attention. HAWKERS Hawkers of food and their storage premises are required to be registered with the Council under Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950. Before an application for registration of a hawker is granted the van is inspected for suitability and confirmation obtained from the local authority in whose area the storage premises are situated that they are satisfactory. The hawker's name and address must also be legibly painted or inscribed on the vehicle. Storage premises must comply with the provisions of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960 before they are registered. At the close of the year there were 41 hawkers on the register, being registered for the sale of:— Greengrocery and Fruit 25 Fish 4 Frankfurters in Split Rolls 1 Ice Cream 6 Eggs 1 Shellfish 1 Confectionery 1 Meat 1 Tea and Cakes 1 During the year five new registrations were made and eight nan es were removed from the register it having been ascertained that the hawkers were no longer tradirg in the Borough. There were eight registered storage premises in the Borough at the end of the year. One new registration was made and ten were removed from the register, their use as such having been discontinued. 48 LICENSED PREMISES Inspections were carried out of the 52 licensed hotels, restaurants and public houses in the Borough and reports submitted to the Licensing Justices on the conditions found. These reports are considered by the Justices at the Brewster Sessions when applications for renewal of existing, or for new licences, are dealt with. This is an annual procedure. Twenty-six of the premises were found to be satisfactory. At the others, works which included repairs to or redecoration of bars or dining rooms, food stores, cellars, cloakrooms, kitchens and sanitary conveniences, repairs or replacement of equipment or refrigerators, and proper maintenance of washing facilities were found to be necessary. Appropriate action was taken to deal with these. During the course of these inspections the District Public Health Inspectors checked on the method of dealing with overspill beer. In only one instance was it found that this beer was being returned from the counter drip trays to a barrel, passed through a filter and then resold to customers. The attention of the brewers was drawn to this undesirable practice with its attendant danger of the possible spread of infection, and the practice was discontinued. At a number of other premises the spillage beer is collected in a barrel and returned to the brewery—it is understood that this is to enable a financial adjustment to be made. At the majority, however, the beer is allowed to run to waste. This problem of loss from spilled beer is, however, likely to disappear with the introduction of closed-circuit draught beer installations. These consist of glass or plastic lined air-tight beer tanks or barrels containing five to ten gallons of beer under pressure. They deliver a measured pint or half-pint of beer at a dispenser and being under pressure could not be interfered with to allow the introduction of waste beer. CATERING PREMISES Apart from licensed premises which have been reported on above, thorough inspections were carried out of the 118 restaurants, cafes and canteens in the Borough. Food supplies were examined and the premises and equipment inspected to ensure that the requirements of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960 were being complied with. At 15 establishments only were conditions found to be entirely satisfactory. At the other 103 establishments the following matters were found to require attention:— Redecoration of dining rooms 23 Redecoration of kitchens 65 Redecoration of preparation rooms, storerooms, etc. 32 General repair of premises 18 Improvement of means of ventilation 20 Improvement of means of lighting 15 Renewal or repair of floors or floor coverings 41 Unsatisfactory surfaces of working tops, tables etc., not capable of being maintained in a clean condition 16 Inadequate or unsuitable food storage accommodation 14 Worn sinks requiring renewal 11 Unserviceable equipment in use 14 Inadequate personal washing facilities 32 Inadequate cupboard or locker accommodation provided for employees' outdoor clothing 11 Inadequate first-aid equipment provided (waterproof dressings etc.) 50 Sanitary Accommodation Repairs required 24 Redecoration required 23 Cleansing required 7 "Now wash Your Hands" notices not prominently displayed 55 49 Drainage not maintained properly 15 Yard surfaces requiring repaying or repairs 16 Refuse receptacles dilapidated or insufficient 30 Food inadequately protected against contamination 17 Accumulations of rubbish requiring removal 15 Interior of cupboards, shelves etc. dirty 15 Fixtures or fittings not kept clean 26 Floors dirty 15 Appropriate action was taken to bring these contraventions to the notice of the proprietors and to have them remedied. No legal proceedings had to be instituted during the year, although in a few cases where matters were still outstanding at the end of the year this was under consideration. It was noted that at 76 of the premises no sanitary accommodation was provided for the use of customers. Under the Public Health Acts 1936—1961 the local authority is given power to, by notice, require the owner or occupier of any building in which food or drink is sold to andconsumedby the public, to provide and maintain in a suitable position a reasonable number of sanitary conveniences for the use of persons frequenting the premises. In many of these premises, however, owing to restricted accommodation it would be physically impossible for toilets to be installed. In the larger establishments proprietors are being requested to provide facilities where they are missing and in all newly established businesses the matter is taken up with the architects, shop fitters etc., before the premises come into use. As the provision of adequate cloakrooms with waterclosets. urinals where appropriate, and washing facilities, separate for the sexes, frequently means sacrificing restaurant seating accommodation, the installation of these amenities is not always looked upon with favour, but with the apparently growing habit of dining out, when meals are taken unhurriedly, adequate toilet accommodation in restaurants in particular, should now be regarded as essential. LICENSING ACT, 1961 REGISTRATION OF CLUBS. Twenty-seven clubs were inspected during the year in connection with applications made to the Magistrates' Court for the renewal of registration certificates entitling the proprietors to sell intoxicating liquors at the premises. Conditions at nineteen of the premises were found to be satisfactory. At the other only eight minor matters were found to require attention all of the clubs having been thoroughly inspected and brought up to a proper standard after the coming into operation of the Act in March 1962. FOOD AND DRUGS SAMPLING Mr John O'Keefe, O.B.E. Chief Officer Public Control Department, Middlesex County Council, has informed me that he is at present unable to supply details of the work carried out by his Department in the Borough of Hendon for the year ending 31st December, 1963, owing to pressure of administrative work in connection with the Weights and Measures Act, 1963 and the transfer of functions under the London Government Act, 1963. A full report of the work of the department will, however, appear later in the year in his annual report to the Middlesex County Council. 50 SECTION F ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Work proceeded steadily throughout the year in connection with the formation of smoke control areas under the Clean Air Act, 1956. The position at the end of the year is shown in the following table: Area No. Part of District Acreage Number of dwellings Number of other premises Date of coming into operation of Order 1 Elstree and part of Edgware. 721 640 19 1st.

This was subsequently withdrawn after the objector had been interviewed and the grants scheme explained to him in detail. The Council continued its policy of making one hundred percent grant, where applied for, of the cost of adaptation of fireplaces in the premises of Charitable and Religious Organisations, and to persons in receipt of retirement pensions or livingon small fixed incomes, subject to the applications being approved by the Borough Treasurer. During the year the mobile exhibition unit of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation visited the new smoke control areas. It was sited at various positions in these areas over a period of a week and demonstrated various types of solid smokeless fuel burning appliances in use. Technical specialists were in attendance to give advice on any problems relating to the use of these fuels. Numerous householders attended the exhibition and showed keen interest in the various types of appliances and fuels. A noticeable preference is now being shown for the much more efficient "room heater" (closed or openable stove) than for the open fire. These heaters are now being produced in much more attractive designs and burn hard coke of which there are plentiful supplies available in the Country. Now that grants are available towards the cost of installing these appliances (Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular No. 69/63) in dwellings in smoke control areas it is anticipated that their popularity will increase. 51 INDUSTRIAL PREMISES 355 observations were made by the Public Health Inspectors of the chimneys of industrial or commercial premises during the year. The number of emissions of smoke noted which contravened the provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956 was relatively small and all were satisfactorily dealt with without recourse to statutory action. BONFIRES Numerous enquiries were received from householders regarding the burning of garden rubbish in Smoke Control Areas. The position is that smoke from bonfires, if a nuisance to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, is, by virtue of Section 16 of the Clean Air Act, 1956 a statutory nuisance liable to be dealt with under the Public Health Act, 1936, irrespective of whether the bonfire is in a Smoke Control Area or not. It follows, therefore, that bonfires should never be lighted on calm or foggy days but only when there is a fairly strong wind blowing which will quickly disperse the smoke without blowing it into adjoining properties so as to be a nuisance to the occupants. Materials should also be dried before burning so that the bonfire burns briskly and is not allowed to smoulder for prolonged periods. It is better to have small bonfires at more frequent intervals which are burned out quickly than large bonfires which might have a tendency to smoulder. Wherever possible, of course, disposal should be by composting. Several complaints were received regarding bonfires during the year. In all cases the offenders were interviewed by the Public Health Inspector of the district concerned and in no case was any recurrence noted which warranted statutory action. MEASUREMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Measurements of the Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide contents of the atmosphere are taken by most local authorities in "black" areas at various sites in their areas in conjunction with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Readings of the instruments are taken daily and the report submitted monthly to the Department. Published lists of the readings are then issued. By this means, not only can a local authority note the progress it is making in its efforts to produce a cleaner atmosphere but it can also make comparisons with local authorities of all types throughout the country. The relationship between air pollution and the incidence of respiratory and other diseases in an area can also be considered. The dust and grit which is sometimes emitted from industrial chimneys, whilst it may be a serious nuisance to the occupiers of premises on which it falls, is of no great significance to public health as the particles are too coarse to reach the human lung. The smoke, however, which is extracted from the atmosphere and measured in the smoke-measuring apparatus consists of very small particles, small enough to remain airborne indefinitely and capable of passing the natural defence mechanisms of the nose and throat and reaching the lungs. These particles come principally from the smoke of domestic chimneys burning bituminous fuel. For a period of 24 hours, air containing any smoke present is drawn through a filter in the measuring apparatus upon which the particles are collected. The darkness of the stain on the filter pad is then measured in a reflectometer and from this reading is calculated the concentration of smoke in the air. Sulphur Dioxide, which is derived from the sulphur present in solid fuels and in fuel oils, is an important gaseous pollutant and its measurement is recorded as, combined with smoke particles, it can seriously injure buildings and fabrics. There is, as yet, no known economical method available of removing sulphur from fuel or from flue gasses.
