GEUNDY, M.D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health BOROUGH OF WEMBLEY ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the Year 1953 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1953. This Report has been compiled in the following five chapters, four with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services.

Statistical Appendix D, Pages 36—48. „ V ADMINISTRATION OF THE MENT AND STAFF, Page 49. 3 CHAPTER I. VITAL STATISTICS. 1. The population of the Borough in mid-1953 was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 129,600 and whilst this is considerably below 131,384 the census figure for 1951 it probably represents the most accurate figure attainable. It is an interesting observation that the population of Wembley and Kingsbury recorded in the census of 1931 was some 65,799, an inter-census increase of 99.7%. Wembley remains the fifth largest County District in Middlesex, those greater, according to population, being Harrow, Ealing, Willesden and Hendon. 2. In 1953 there were recorded 1,490 live births, giving a birth rate of 11.5 per thousand of the estimated population. The number of deaths was 1,127 giving a crude death rate of 8.70 per thousand. When the comparability factor (1.10) is applied the standardised death rate becomes 9.57, a decrease on last year's figure and below the national rate of 11.4 per thousand of the population. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 20.13 showed a slight drop compared with the figure of 1952 and is below the national rate for England and Wales yet it demands some attention. Prematurity of birth and congenital malformation are the main causes of death in very young infants and an emergency unit is maintained at the Edgware General Hospital which can be called to the house when a premature birth occurs to give immediate and skilled attention prior to removal if necessary to hospital. 4. During the year there was one death from maternal causes. 4 STATISTICAL APPENDIX A. CERTAIN VITAL STATISTICS, 1953 from figures supplied by Registrar-General.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital and the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital are situated in the Borough and these hospitals are under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross Hospital. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the Hendon Isolation Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley Hospital. Arrangements are made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included:— Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10.. (Elgar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (Edgware 8181.) Wembley Hospital, Fairview Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex. (Wembley 3136.) Kingsbury Maternity Hospital, Honeypot Lane, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (Colindale 6309.) Neasden Hospital, Brentfield Road, Neasden, N.W.IO. (Willesden 2117.) Hendon Isolation Hospital, Goldsmith Avenue, Hendon, N.W.9. (Colindale 8182.)

Edgware Chest Clinic, Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (Edgware 4467/8.) 12 2. AMBULANCE SERVICE. A service of ambulances and sitting case cars is maintained by the Middlesex County Council as Local Health Authority at:— No. 4 Depot. (Elgar 5506.) The accident service is obtained by dialling 999. The authority of a medical practitioner is required for service to be given, except in emergency and accident cases. 3. HEALTH SERVICES. Health Services under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 19-16, are provided by the County Council and relevant details in so far as they apply to the borough are included below:— County Medical Officer: A.

Only 1 case, an adult, was referred to Kensington Medicinal Baths for treatment more intensive than could be given at the Clinics or in the homes. The generalisation remains true that infestation is scarcely a Public Health problem in Wembley. The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 14 5. MORTUARY. The public mortuary which was built a good many years ago at a time when the population was under 20,000, has continued to meet the needs of the district. That this has been possible is partly due to the provision in recent years of a refrigerated chamber which has proved of inestimable benefit. Neverthless, the time cannot be too far off when a new mortuary planned on present-day standards of lay-out and equipment will have to be provided. 100 bodies were deposited in the mortuary during the year, the majority of which were on orders from the Coroner so that post-mortem examinations could be made. 15 STATISTICAL APPENDIX B.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 1. SERVICES PROVIDED, Notification, investigation, pamphlets issued on the various infectious diseases, exclusion from school of patients and contacts, advice re milk handlers— Disinfection—Hospitalisation generally at Hendon Isolation Hospital or Neasden Hospital, re puerperal pyrexia and ophthalmia neonatorum, Emergency Bed Service, re poliomyelitis at Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, re smallpox as arranged by the Regional Hospital Board—Notification of tuberculosis—Weekly and quarterly returns to the Registrar-General and County Medical Officer—Authentication of travellers' inoculation state—Food poisoning notification and investigation—Scabies, arrangements with Royal Borough of Kensington—Complete bacteriological service available at Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, outfits distributed from Public Health Department. 2. There is little to note in this Section for the year, as the absence of any unusual infectious disease and the lack of any major outbreak of notifiable disease have not occasioned serious concern during the year. The incidence of common infections of infancy varies slightly from time to time and the figures in the statistical appendix indicate that the experience in 1953 was not unusual or in any way adverse. It will be seen from figures later in the chapter that there was one outbreak of food poisoning of which the Department was aware, involving 80 cases, although all of these were mild and transient. There is no doubt that a number of mild cases and of mild food poisoning outbreaks occur where the symptoms are so transient that medical attention is not called and the cases, therefore, are not notified. It would be a help in tracing the source of contamination if such cases could be brought to the notice of the Department at a very early stage when remains of the food eaten may well be available for bacteriological investigation. The result of these investigations would enable advice to be given to the kitchen staff where the outbreak had originated and would enlarge our knowledge of sources of infection and enable us to give more detailed advice to the community generally. 3. The supervision of contacts landing from ship or aeroplane called for routine surveillance of 4 persons regarding smallpox and Nil persons regarding typhoid fever. Constant vigilance must be exercised on persons arriving from infected foreign areas and this supervision must be given with discretion and understanding. 17 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

CENSUS—1951. The report of the Registrar General on the Census figures of 1951 relating to the County of Middlesex is now published. It contains a mass of very interesting statistical data relating not only to Middlesex as a whole but also in relation to each County District in Middlesex. Appropriate extracts from this report have been made. 25 Population. Middlesex.

A new departure in the information required on the Census forms filled in by the heads of households was whether the household was provided with piped water, cooking stove, kitchen sink, water closet and fixed bath, and whether these facilities were shared with other households. The report points out, however, that preliminary examination of the answers recorded reveals that there has been some inconsistency among heads of households in interpreting what constitutes "sharing" of a household arrangement, in addition to an appreciable but not unexpected element of uncertainty among heads of households as to the precise meaning to be attached to the somewhat complicated definitions of the arrangements. Therefore, it is suggested that the records should only be used to obtain a broad picture of the availability of household arrangements, more particularly in illustrating relative conditions in different types of household and in different parts of the country. Piped Water Supply. For the purposes of the Census a "piped water supply" meant the existence of a tap connected to the mains or to a storage tank, which could be reached by a household without leaving the shelter of a building containing the rooms occupied by it or of an attached covered structure. The report indicates that out of a total of 41,282 households in Wembley, 7,692 share piped water supply and 16 are said to be entirely without. These two figures together expressed as a percentage equal 19% and compare quite favourably with other districts in the County; only three other districts have a lower figure for households being entirely without a piped water supply, The percentage figure for the County as i whole is 21% whilst that for London is 31%. Cooking Stove. A Cooking Stove or Range means any cooking stove, kitchen range or other fixed grate using gas, electricity or any other fuel, provided there is an oven. One or more gas rings, hot plates or portable electric ovens are not by themselves enough to be called a cooking stove or range. The statistics show that 2,534 households in Wembley share cooking facilities and 215 are without, giving a combined percentage figure of 7%. The comparable figure for Middlesex is 7%; for London 8%. Kitchen Sink means a sink inside the building, whether in a kitchen or not, with a drain pipe leading outside the building and normally used for washing up, etc. It does not include a wash basin designed for personal toilet. 30 In Wembley 2,975 households share a kitchen sink, 1,177 are without the amenity, giving a combined percentage figure of 10%. Comparable percentages are Middlesex 11%, London 16%. As would be expected the large majority of households sharing or without kitchen sinks were found to be those sharing dwellings. Water Closet means a water closet flushed by water, either from a cistern or by hand, and emptying into a main sewer, septic tank or cesspool. It does not include a chemical closet or earth closet. 7,783 households in the Borough share a water closet, whilst 10 households are said to be without, giving a combined percentage of 19%. For Middlesex the comparable percentage is 18%, which is only half as high as that for London. The figure of 10 households reported as being entirely without a water closet, even though it is the lowest in Middlesex apart from one district which is very much smaller, causes some surprise. None of these cases (if in fact they do exist) is known to the Public Health Department for it has been the policy of the Council for some years to secure the conversion of closets on the conservancy system to the water carriage system as soon as a sewer became available. This figure, low as it is, and bearing in mind the knowledge possessed by the Public Health Department, would appear to corroborate the views expressed in the Census report that some of the information collated might not be altogether correct. Fixed Bath. Fixed Bath means a bath permanently installed and connected with a waste pipe leading outside the building. It does not matter for this purpose whether there is water piped to it, or whether the room where it is installed is used only as a bathroom or not. 8,3'02 households in the Borough share a fixed bath whilst 683 are entirely without, giving a combined percentage of 22%. The comparable figure for Middlesex is 35%; for England and Wales 45% ; for London 62%. Summary. Of the 41,282 households in Wembley, 31,424 or 76% have the exclusive use of all five of the previously mentioned arrangements (Middlesex 62%); 37,075 or 90% have exclusive use of a kitchen stove and sink (Middlesex 89%); 677 or 2% are without exclusive use of a fixed bath but have the exclusive use of the other four arrangements (Middlesex 12%); 4,005 or 10% are without the exclusive use of a sink and a water closet (Middlesex 10%). Marital Condition. Of a total of 61,987 males living in Wembley at the time of the Census 23,681 were single, 36,392 were married, 1,605 were 31 widowers and 309 divorced. Of a total of 69,397 females 25,637 were single, 36,901 were married, 6,305 were widowed and 554 were divorced. The Census report states "The most significant feature of the distributions by marital condition is the increase since 1931 in proportions married, particularly in the younger age groups. It is due in part to the tendency of people to marry earlier than formerly. At age 20-24 in Middlesex there are now 210 males married per thousand as compared with only 139 in 1931 and 431 females per thousand compared with 247 in 1931. For females there are increases at every age." 3. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough, which is provided by the Colne Valley Water Co., except for a small area in the southern end of the district supplied by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Co., remained satisfactory in quality and quantity. The supply is pumped from deep wells in the chalk outside the Borough boundaries. All of the samples taken from piped supplies were reported as satisfactory. No tendency to plumbo solvent action has been detected. All dwelling houses in the Borough are provided with a mains water supply. There is a number of private wells in the Borough all in connection with industrial undertakings, but in no instance is the water from these sources used for drinking. The Council have continued to express their concern at the hardness of the public water supplies which expressed a total hardness range from 180—240 parts per million. Whilst there would not appear to be evidence of prejudicial effects to health from such hard water i.ts detrimental effects on boilers and hot water systems are well-known. 4. SWIMMING POOLS. The two outdoor Swimming Pools have continued to be a source of enjoyment and healthy recreation. "Breakpoint" chlorination or superchlorination which was installed just prior to the 1951 season has made it possible to maintain a sparkling clear water, together with a minimum risk of infection. Attendances at the Pools during the year were:— Kingsbury 121,652 Vale Farm, Wembley 100,117 5. RIVERS AND STREAMS. This subject was dealt with in considerable detail in the report for 1952, including a description of the various water courses and sources of pollution. Considerable efforts were continued during 1953 to trace sources of 32 pollution and it is known that a substantial number of wrong connections was found and remedied which should assist in improving the quality of the water flowing in the various water courses. The County Council have continued the systematic sampling of river water at monthly intervals from two selected points, one near where the River Brent enters and the other near where it leaves the Borough, and the results of chemical examination by the County Chemist have been generally satisfactory. 6. FOOD HYGIENE. The number of food premises in the area, by type of business, the number of premises registered and the number of inspections are set out in the statistical appendix on page 37. Condemned food is disposed of at the Council's Refuse Disposal Plant at Alperton Lane either by incineration in the furnaces or, if suitable, in the Waste Food Plant. The Wembley Clean Food Association has continued its activities in the Borough and by way of an innovation inaugurated a Clean Food Conference which was held in the Town Hall early in 1954 and attended by some 120 delegates representing Clean Food Guilds and Associations, together with Members of Parliament, Councillors and Officers of Local Authorities and representatives from the various Ministries including, of course, the Ministry of Food. These delegates came from London and the south generally, but a number came from the Midlands. His Worship the Mayor, Alderman C. H. Smith, O.B.E., J.p., welcomed the delegates on behalf of the Borough of Wembley, and Mr. Councillor M. J. Curley of Wembley was elected Chairman of the Conference. An instructive address was given by Dr. Betty C. Hobbs of the Public Health Laboratory Service. The real object of the Conference was to discuss the modus operandi of Clean Food Guilds, their future, the further improvement of food handling and the formation of a National Clean Food Association. The Conference agreed in principle to the formation of such an Association and set up a Committee to take the necessary procedural steps with a view to the formation of an Association. 7. FOOD AND DRUGS (MILK, DAIRIES AND ARTIFICIAL CREAM) ACT, 1950; THE MILK AND DAIRIES REGULATIONS, 1949; THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (RAW MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949 and 1950; THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (PASTEURISED AND STERILISED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949 and 1950; THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (SPECIFIED AREAS) ORDER, 1951. 33 This legislation was fully operative in the Borough for the whole of 1953 with the result that all milk sold in the area was designated milk, the bulk of it being pasteurised or sterilised. No action was found to be necessary under Regulation 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations (relating to disease communicable to man by consumption of milk). During 1953, 149 licences to sell designated milk were issued by the Council. 8. SLAUGHTERHOUSES. In the early part of 1954 the Ministry of Food intimated to local authorities that meat rationing would end in July of this year and that centralised slaughtering of food animals under direct Ministry control would then cease with the result that the trade would be expected to make their own arrangements. Local authorities were asked to review slaughtering arrangements in their areas to ensure that sufficient facilities would be available. The position in this Borough will presumably remain as it was before the War. One small slaughterhouse used in connection with a family business was licensed prior to 1939 and an annual licence has been renewed since the War, although up to the moment the premises have not been used. Most of the meat supplies for the Borough have come from the London Meat Markets. No horse slaughtering on licensed premises has been carried on in Wembley. 9. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Fortunately during 1953 there was no recurrence of the persistent and deadly fog which occurred in December, 1952, but, nevertheless, on occasions fog was experienced. Although much has been said and written about the fog of 1952 (at Conferences and other places), no one has yet been able to say with certainty what constituent of the fog produced such lethal effects. Conjectures have been made, including one concerning the possible synergistic properties of certain constituents of fog. Although there are records of the quantities of sulphur dioxide and smoke present in the atmosphere there are none concerning the presence of carbon monoxide which might have risen to an unprecedented level. Perhaps the Beaver Committee appointed by the Government to enquire into the matter will in their final report be able to produce more definite information. There is still much to be done towards the attainment of a cleaner atmosphere but a word of caution is necessary. Even if the elimination of all of the visible smoke and particles in the 34 atmosphere could be achieved in the near future there would still be relatively large quantities of sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide for these dangerous gases are still produced with smokeless combustion of such fuels as high and low temperature cokes and fuel oils. Up to the moment science has not been able to produce really economic methods of preventing these gases being discharged to atmosphere. 10. RODENT CONTROL. The Rodent Control Service which is confined to dealing with infestations by rats and mice has continued to operate during the year under review. A staff of three "Ministry trained" assistants has performed the necessary work. No charge is made to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. 905 premises were found to be infested and 864 premises were satisfactorily treated. The following details of sewer treatment have been provided by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor. In March, 1953, a 10% test bait of sewer manholes was carried out. 393 manholes were baited and there were 6 complete "takes" and 68 partial "takes". In the treatment which followed 172 manholes were baited when there were 6 complete "takes" and 107 partial "takes." The corresponding figures for the 15th Maintenance Treatment carried out in October, 1953, were—manholes baited 330, complete "takes" 14, partial "takes" 114. No new developments in poisoning technique were introduced during the year but Warfarin which was used very extensively during 1952/53 has continued to produce good results. 35 STATISTICAL APPENDIX D.

During the year your medical officers have acted professionally for the Council, performing 39 clinical medical examinations of actual or potential staff and have provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council. This activity helps in the provision of a medically sound personnel for all activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual case of sickness, thereby maintaining a standard of efficiency impossible without such a service. I am proud to record the loyalty and diligence displayed in the routine work of the office, and I take this opportunity of thanking the whole staff for another year of conscientious effort. I would conclude by an expression of appreciation to all members of the Council, especially those who serve on the Health Committee and particularly the Chairman, for the admirable way in which they have directed the policy of the Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health. 49 Hendon Printing Works Ltd. 42/44, Victoria Road, N.W.4 Phone: HEN 1004 RH/7H. jipiip i;FK;v
