The Sixth Annual Report of the Vestry of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark, is prepared and published in pursuance of the provisions of the enactment entitled "The Metropolis Management Act, 1855." As in former Years, the particulars relating to the Sanitary condition of the Parish will be found detailed in the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health, which commences on page 11. The Vestry Accounts, vouched by the Allowance of the Auditors, (see page 10) together with other Statements herein contained, shew the General Proceedings of the Vestry during the Year Till the present Year, the Precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works (see Account in Abstract—Sewers' Rate—page 7) has been paid by the Vestry in moieties. The Metropolitan Board of Works has, however, determined to insist that the whole amount of the Precept for the ordinary expenses of the Board shall be paid in the month of June. This will oblige the Vestry to direct that the whole amount of the Precept for 1863 shall be included in the Bate to be made for the first half of that Year; and will Cause, much to the regret of the Vestry, the making on that occasion of a larger Sewers Bate than has usually been required. The Accounts of the Churchwardens for the Year, all which have been Audited by the Auditors of the Parish, are appended as of late years has been usual. (See pp. 26 to36.) This Year are added the Accounts in Abstract of the Overseers and of the Guardians in relation to the Poor Rate; and also a Statement, furnished by the Chairman of the Board of Guardians, of the Poor Belief afforded during the Year. On application to the undersigned at the Vestry Hall, any Parishioner will be furnished with a Copy of this Report. DANIEL BIRT, Vestry Clerk.

STATEMENT OF ALLOWANCE OF THE AUDITORS. (18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120, s. 196.) WE, Stephen Knight, Joseph Webster, and William Gilpin, the Auditors for the Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark, having in this present Month of May, in the Year One Thousand Eight Hundred and Sixty Two, attended at the Office of the Vestry of the said Parish, and there Audited the Accounts thereof for the Year ending the 25th day of March last, Do hereby state our allowance of the said Accounts, as the same are in the proper Books signed by us, in accordance with the foregoing Account in Abstract, shewing under the before mentioned several distinct heads, the Receipt and Expenditure of the Vestry under the Metropolis Local Management Act. Dated this Sixth Day of May, 1862. STEPHEN KNIGHT, JOSEPH WEBSTER, WILLIAM GILPIN. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 11 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY.DAY, 1862. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, The Census of England has been taken since I had the honour of presenting you with my last report: I am consequently enabled to place before you with accuracy, the death rate of this district—the standard by which its sanatory condition must be measured. I find that the death rate I gave you in the report for 1860.1 was less than the actual fact, the increase of the population not having reached the proportion usually allowed. This in a great degree may be accounted for by our position. Our district very much resembles a walled town, only instead of being girdled by walls, it is hemmed in by the surrounding parishes; hence we cannot extend our borders ; but if we increase in numbers, we must grow in height, or become still more overcrowded. Altogether it is highly unfavourable to the preservation and renewal of health, being situated upon an alluvial soil, with a line of hills on the one hand, and a river on the other : precisely the circumstances which give rise to a variety of fevers; besides aiding the developement and propagation of every kind of epidemic disease. We cannot alter our position; but we may make strenuous, and in the end successful endeavours to improve it. One great hindrance to the fulfilment of this object is the defects of the present Building.act. A house may be built anywhere, and almost anyhow, provided "all the rooms can be lighted and ventilated from a street or alley adjoining." The object of the Builder is to save as much ground, materials, and expense, as possible. The result is not difficult to foresee. Our forefathers, whose recklessness as regarded cleanliness and the means of securing health was astounding, nevertheless gained a glimpse into the evils arising from the crowding of buildings together, and took means to prevent it; but of so extreme a kind, as to hinder the law from being put in force. In the year 1656, an act was passed, in which certain, fines and penalties were directed to be levied on all new houses which had not four acres of land with them and Commissioners were appointed to see this statute carried out. The reason given for the making of this law was the excessive number of houses erected together, which were "found to be very mischievous and inconvenient; and a great annoyance and inconvenience to the commonwealth." If this proposal was a step of an extreme kind, yet correct in a good direction, we have taken similar steps in another and worse direction. There are many gradations between a yard of four acres, and no yard at all. The examination of the dwellings in which our labouring classes are compelled to live, is very discouraging; and the more so when we witness, as we still do, the erection of new ones which will carry into the future, the evils we are now striving to put an end to. Thus is hope cut off; and poverty, sickness, and misery, have free course to drag on, unchecked, their retributive punishment. 12 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. TABLE No. 1.

Upon examining this Table, we shall find that the mortality is largest in the Borough.road sub. district, altheugh it contains the fewest number of persons and families. One reason which may be given for this result is, that there is a less number of houses for the 16,667 (a) The statistics from which this Table is formed were kindly furnished me by G. Wyatt, Esq., Chief Clerk of Census Office* Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 13 inhabitants to dwell in, than in either of the other two sub.districts. Thus the London. road sub.district, which follows next in rate of mortality, has 2441 houses, occupied by 19,189 persons; the Kent.road sub.district 4,699, by 19,653; whilst the Borough.road has 4,050 for its population. Kent.road sub.district is the most privileged for the 'number of houses, and there the death rate is decidedly the smallest. But the main reason, for the larger mortality in the Borough.road sub.district is, that it contains the "Workhouse; this of course adds greatly to the death rate; whilst at the same time it lessens that of the other two, the sick and dying poor being removed from them to it. 2,034 children have been born alive during the year ending March 29th, 1862; giving an increase of 172 over the preceding year. Of these, there wore registered 1051 Boys, and 983 Girls : leaving a majority of 68 Boys. 1429 deaths were registered during the same time; 190 more than in the year ending March, 1861. The deaths of the Males were 741, and these of the Females 688 ; giving a preponderance of 53 Males over the Females.

On examining the annexed Table you will find that zymotic diseases have been upon the increase. This increase is chiefly owing to the greater prevalence of Diptheria, Scarlatina, Hooping Cough, Diarrhoea, and Typhus. Respectively, the increase has been 14, 21, 20, 34, and 23. The two largest majorities are from diarrhcea and typhus. There have been 12 deaths from Cholera, in place of 1. The deaths from Typhus have been nearly doubled. This disease, it is stated, is entirely within our control; as it takes its origin from fermenting excreta, whether contained in cess.pools, dungheaps, or imperfect drains, which indeed are but extended cess.pools, The poison enters into the system, either by the way of the stomach or lungs : by the former in the water used as a beverage; and by the latter, through the medium of the atmosphere. This fever, so allowed to spring up and spread, carried off in the year 1859, 15,877 persons, 14 Parish of St. George th Martyr, Southwark. and in the year 1857, 19,016; a terrible mortality, when we reflect that there need not have happened one single death. At the close of the last year, we well remember it struck down the "foremost man in all the land," to the great alarm of the nation; and for awhile excited and received special attention. A notable individual, or numbers of obscure individuals, must perish before an evil will be remedied. To reach any blessing we must pass through woe and suffering ; nay, the only pathway to health, happiness, and liberty leads over the dead bodies of our brethren, slain in the strife. Thus it has ever been; and apparently will ever remain. In 1858, Windsor suffered from a virulent attack of this fever. At this period, as a necessary premise, that royal town was in a most neglected and disgraceful condition; arising from imperfect drainage, numerous pig.sties, and heaps of dung and garbage. Besides this, the people were drinking water into which was constantly filtering the contents of cess.pools ; and so received the poison both by stomach and lungs. The evidences of its origin were plain and palpable ; not to be gainsaid. It happened also, as if on purpose to demonstrate the truth of this, that the Castle which was theroughly drained, directly into the Thames, having no connexion whatever with the Town drainage was exempt: whilst at the same time there were certain dependencies of the Castle which did not share in this privilege. What was the consequence ? In these dependencies the fever raged with great severity, thirty cases having occurred; whilst the Castle entirely escaped, not one case being met with there. A man may have his own house in a good sanatory state, and so also may be the neighbourhood in which he dwells; but if other localities, brooding over their foul cess.pools and bad drains, he runs the risk of a long sickness, and perchance of death, from fever. Let this disease once arise, and no place is secure, no habitation is safe from its visit: it cannot be confined within definite limits, do what we may. It is, however, being driven away from its old haunts—from the narrow alley, the crowded court, and squalid street, where it has so long committed its ravages ; and appears now to be migrating towards the better class of houses, which have not obtained the sanatory supervision bestowed upon the former. Doubtless there exists many a lordly mansion, noble square, and magnificent street, in which Typhus.poison is constantly generated, and where it lingers or creeps stealthily in and out; and if not of sufficient power to reproduce itself, yet sufficient to give rise to the discomfort, apathy, and wretchedness of all these abiding within its influence. Architects, thus far, have not deemed the state of the soil, nor the means of ventilation, worthy their attention. TABLE No. 5. Small Pox Measles Scarlatina Hooping Cough Diarrhcea and Cholera.

There have, however, been 12 deaths less from Pneumonia. The deaths under five years of age have increased by 104. Premature birth and debility are marked as the cause of 32 deaths, a diminution of 12. An increase of 12 has taken place from violence and privation. The most important of these I will particularize. Nine Infants have died from suffocation, varying in age from five days to nine months. One out of the number died from a fit of coughing, brought on by taking a dose of medicine. A 16 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southward. boy, four years old, was suffocated in a room which was on fire. A male child, aged 20 months, died from the effects of drinking hot water out of the spout of a kettle. Three Males and one Female, aged 50, 59, 62, and 45 years, fell down dead; and two Males, aged 59 and 73, were found dead on the floor of their rooms. A drover, aged 42, died from Erysipelas, produced from inoculation of matter from a diseased sheep which he was dressing. A Male, aged 27, died from a fall on the back of his head: a "Woman, aged 84, from injuries received by falling down stairs. A Man, aged 51, was drowned by falling head first into a water butt, whilst in the act of drawing water out. Two Malos and two Females hung themselves, aged 50, 52, 55 and 56. Five persons have died from privation of food. Two out of these were needlewomen, unmarried; examples of the sad effects of an unfair day's wage for a fair day's work. I present you, as usual, with the analysis of the water of the Lambeth and Southwark Companies, made by Dr. R. D. Thomson, and published in the weekly returns of the Registrar General. TABLE No. 8.

The mean temperature of the first Quarter of the year at Greenwich was 39.9°, which was 1.8° above the average for 90 years. The cold in the first half of January was very severe, more so than in any similar period since 1820; that is, in 41 years: the average daily deficiency from the 2nd to the 23rd was 3.7°; after this, the weather became milder, and continued so until the end of the Quarter, with an average daily excess of 3.3°. The coldest January of which we have record happened in 1795, the temperature being 23.9°; the next in order of severity were as follows—1814, 26.9°; 1776, 27.0°; 1780, 28.6°; 1838, 28.9°. Tho fall of rain during this period was 4.5 inches, 0.5 inch below the average. On Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 17 February 21st there occurred a strong gale of wind, which uprooted trees, and caused a great destruction of proporty. On that day, from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., the wind passed with a velocity of fully 70 miles, and with a pressure varying from 13 lbs to 25 lbs on the square foot. Snow fell 15 days each in January and March, and 8 in February. Fogs prevailed throughout the country. The moan temperature of the air for the spring quarter was 51.8°, 0 4° below the average for 90 years. The weather in May was variable : keeping cold until the middle, when there occurred a few warm days, followed again by cold days. On the 23rd of this month, the temperaturo reached 80: on the same day, in the year 1860, the highest temperature was met with, but it was 76.5° only. The month of June was also hotter than the same month in the preceding year. The total fall of rain was 4'5 inches, being 1.3 below the average of 46 years. Hail and snow fell in April and May. The summer months were hotter by 4.20° than these of 1860 ; the mean temperature being 60.4°. Tho temperature was below the average until the commencement of August, when the weather set in warm, and continued so until the 11th of September; and also again September 28th, and remained until the close of the Quarter. On August 12th, it was as high as 72.9°, being nearly 12° in excess of the average. On the last day of September it rose to 74°, the mean for the day being 61.5°: since 1814, this is the only instance of the temperature of that day rising so high as 60°. There fell during the Quarter 4½ inches of rain, 3½ inches below the averago of the preceding 41 years. Hail fell in various places in July and September. The month of October was remarkable for its high temperature, 54.9°. There has been no such warm October since 1831. The temperature in November was, with the exception of a few days, below the average. In December, as far as the 25th, it was high, when the cold set in, and continued until the end of the year. The mean temperature of the Quarter was 45.5°, 2.0° above the average of 90 years. The total fall of rain was 7'4 inches, about a ¼ inch above the average. With the exception of 1853, this is the greatest rain fall for 45 years. I may here with propriety compare, in their results upon the health of the people, the two last summers; the one having been fine, delightful, and hot; the other wet, gloomy, and cold. The former, that of 1861, has been attended with a considerable amount of Diarrhoea, and also many cases of Cholera; whilst the latter, that of 1860, gave the lowest number of deaths from these causes, especially Diarrhoea, ever known. This was owing to the wetness of the season, and the lowness of the temperature, which only reached 56.2°, 3.3° less than in any corresponding Quarter for 89 years; whilst the rain fall in the driest month had an excess of 2.1 inch. In some of our provincial towns there is a great deficiency in the water supply ; and in these places especially, the abundance of rain greatly diminished the death rate. Thus Nature made for us an experiment upon a large scale, and showed clearly the efficacy of water as a sanatory agent. A statement made by the Registrar General may be thus written: Given a town, where the ordinary water supply is deficient, the mortality will be considerably diminished by heavy rains. The continued gloom and wetness of that miserable summer has shewn openly a great truth, which we shall do well to lay to heart. In Rome, more than twenty centuries ago, no house was considered fit for habitation, unless fully supplied with water. It is said that at one time 18 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. "the imperial city contained 1,300 reservoirs, into which the mighty aqueducts that spanned the road campagna poured a daily supply of 15 millions of cubic feet, or 325 millions of gallons of water." In this year of grace, 1862, and in this metropolis, there are numbers which do not receive one drop from month to month; whilst to all (with the fewest exceptions) it is only given for a limited time daily. Water, of which there is such an abundance in this country, (or it is sadly belied) and of which there is such an urgent need, is thus miserably doled out to us. Wo have had occasion, for various purposes, to take out summonses; and these have brought about the designs intended. There was one, which I will more especially notice, as it may form a precedent; and that was for the removal of a Piggery in Falstaff's Yard. It was somewhat notable, from the number of times it had boon brought before the Vestry, or rather the Sewers' Committee, both by my predecessor and myself. A desire having been manifested not to have it removed unless really necessary, many suggestions for mprovements were made, and as readily carried out by the proprietor. Nevertheless complaints were still repeated by these dwelling near, and with great roason. In a small space were collected together as many as 60 Pigs. It was quite impossible so largo a number could bo kept in such a locality, witheut creating a nuisance, and one of an intolerable kind. I feel bound to say that the owner did all ho could to prevent complaint except—remove them. The condition of Pigs thus kept is most unnatural; huddled together, with scarce room to stretch their legs, much less to take exercise, an object very necessary for the keeping them in health, and fit for food. It has been urged in favour of keeping pigs in towns, that they eat up the offensive offal and refuso, and in fact, act as scavengers. I would ask, What manner of food must pigs so fed make? Who, of choice and knowledge, would eat these scavengers ? Pigs cannot be too carofully fed, nor their health too closely tended, as their sole ond is to bo eaten. During the reign of Georgo III. many important sanatory measures were brought beforo Parliament; but the only one which, succeeded in becoming law, was that for the prevention of keeping pigs in towns: a fact which led Goldsmith to observe, that all ended in a squeak! Every thing connected with the health and strength of the young, who are to carry forward the destinies of this great nation, when these who are now labouring under the heat and burden of the day shall have lain them down to rest, must needs bo a matter of the first importance. One of the purposes for which this Vestry was appointed was, to carry out these measures that had for their aim the prevention of sickness and untimely death; and in no wise can this be more fitly done, than by looking after the interests of the young. And who cannot but pity their case in this vast city ? Where are their fields and play.grounds, in which they may give full swing to their physical instincts, and developo their bone and muscle, upon the basis of which a strong and sound mind can alone be formed? Nowhere ! For them exists only the street, or may be a small back yard, which a hop and skip would compass; but even this privilege is not common; and a street was I not made for a play.ground. Indeed, its use for such a purpose is far from being unattended with danger. Some games are perilous to organ and limb. Accidents from this cause wo must all have seen or heard of; besides, property is endangered. The chief actors in the scene often also suffer for the doing of that which Providence intended, else is their instinct utterly perverted. How often are they emphatically sworn at, cuffed on the ears, or Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 19 dragged off to the Police station. I do not think the conversion of an open free space into an iron fenced, carefully guarded park, a boon to boys, whatever it may be to others. Of course, I am not speaking against the formation of parks; let us have as many as possible; and play.grounds also. Public and open spaces are good, oven as reservoirs of fresh air, and as media for diluting the poison constantly manufactured in a crowded community. " Here in this mighty Babylon, 2½ millions of human beings are living, huddled together in one compact mass, like boos in their cells. And not we alone, but to us are linked crowds of dogs, cats, birds, and horses; along with chickens in areas, cows in yards, pigs in cellars, and a host of rabbits and vermin of all kind. And what is all this crowd of compressed mortality doing, but loading the earth and atmosphere with emanations the most foul." Yet in spite of all this, our gardens and open spaces are daily diminishing: however time honoured they are, or useful they might bo, they disappear before the ruthless hand of the builder, who upon them runs up monotonous rows of brick houses. Trees are being felled, and shrubs grubbed up ; and these, should repentance ever overtake us, cannot be replaced in a day. Why should not our metropolis bo as famed for its health and beauty, as it is for its wealth and magnitude ? I have often wished that our rich benefactors, who leave large legacies for the euro of sickness, would commence at the other end, and leave them for the prevention of sickness. And now at last, and with a liberality which throws all former gifts into the shade, has this been done, and by a stranger. All thanks to the giver for this gift; and I sincerely hope that end desired by this benevolent act, may be brought to a successful issue. The subject under discussion will claim a far more serious attention than has yet been bestowed upon it. The Census has shewn us that the population of towns is upon the increase. During the last ten years, this increase has reached over 12 per cont; whilst during the same time, many of the small towns and boroughs have steadily decreased. Men are more and more aggregating together; and whilst we gladly road the benefits resulting from such a social state, we must be careful to provent the evils which otherwise will assuredly follow, as the shadow the substance. The Registrar General has warningly said, "The question of the health of towns is therefore a question of the health of England." As bearing upon the above, I must mention the desire there has been shewn in certain quarters, of appropriating our disused cemeteries for building purposes; and otherwise turning them to pecuniary account. Attempts of such a nature should be earnestly resisted; not only for the reason of the injury that must follow to the health of the people from destroying these "lesser lungs," but also from the desecration to the dead involved. An application is to bo made to Parliament, I believe, for the purpose of inducing it to concede a Cemetery in St. Giles's.in.the.Fields, for the benefit of the Rector and his successors. This demand, if granted, will soon bo followed by others of a like kind. When news came over, that the graves of these who so nobly fell before the ramparts of Sebastopol had been disturbed by the treasure seeking inhabitants of the Crimea, indignation stirred up the hearts of the people at the wanton outrage. And shall we permit a similar deed to be perpetrated even at our own doors, and arising from the same motive—gain ? Lot the dead quietly rest in the graves to which they were committed by their sorrowing relatives; and there, by the decay and change through which they must pass in the course of time, kindle into beauty tree and flower, for the benefit and delight of the living. 20 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.

And the old tale is repeated, that where there is overcrowding, deficiency of light, want of air, and other sanatory necessaries, there the death rate is highest. Much has lately been said and written concerning the imperfect sanatory condition of many parts of this Parish: " that if we are not positively going back, we are standing still; that epidemic diseases and poverty here find their seat and home, carrying off victims, who had they resided elsewhere, might still have been alive; that, in fact, there hangs thickly and heavily over us the cloud of decay and neglect." Complaints of this kind, indeed of any kind, are easily made, yet often most untruthfully, inasmuch as they are only part of a truth. Suppose, in describing the character of a man, you only speak of his follies and his weaknesses, he would make but a sorry figure; but the likeness would not be correct, it would not represent the whole man; would not be a nature's photograph. There is scarcely a parish in London, of which the like might not be said, as was said of ours. This Parish is neither better nor worse than its neighbours. I find that there were twenty-one applicants for Sayer's and Shaw's Charity, whose average age was 73 years. Now these applicants are these who have necessarily passed through much want and suffering,. and who have lived long in the Parish; most of them, probably, all their lives. There was one aged eighty.two years, three eighty.one, one seventy.nine, two seventy.eight, one seventy.seven, 22 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health. two seventy-five, one seventy-three, two seventy-two, one seventy, two sixty-eight, four sixty-six, and one sixty-four. We have with us a great number of poor: and poverty carries along with it many and sore inconveniences, from which there is no escape. One of these inconveniences is the little choice the poor man possesses in the selection of a habitation. Ho must needs take that, the rent of which will suit his wages; and should ho have a family, then is the choice still more narrowed. This accounts for the wretched places in which numerous families are compelled to live. Far wiser and more beneficial than making complaints, would be building, or aiding in building, proper dwellings. Those at present standing in our parish we cannot pull down; neither can we ever put them in a sanatory condition. Houses will yet have to be built, not for the sake of profit and income, but for the good of the poor; and it is only when this shall be brought to pass, that one of the chief difficulties of the sanatory reformer will be removed. It, however, only remains, that we go onward in our way, "unhasting, yet unresting"; neither creating mistrust nor hatred on the one hand by rash and inconsiderate proceeding; nor on the other, giving reason for complaint by apathy and lukewarrmnoss. And thus shall one of the designs for which this Vestry was formed be most successfully carried out. HENRY BATESON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. April 22nd, 1862.
