Camberwell 1895. Medical Officer's Annual Report. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, During the year 1895, which for statistical purposes is assumed to consist of 52 weeks, the births in London numbered 133,715, and the deaths 86,937. The population for the middle of 1895 is calculated to be 4,392,346, and this number is used in the determination of the marriage-rate, birth-rate and death-rate for London. The birth-rate was 30.5 per thousand, which is the lowest that has ever been recorded for London, with the exception of that of 1894, which was 30.1 per thousand. The marriage-rate for 1895 was 17.1 per thousand, as contrasted with 17.0 and 17.2 for 1894 and 1893 respectively. The death-rate was 19.8 per thousand, which was 2.0 more than that recorded for 1894; if the deaths of persons known to be strangers occurring in metropolitan institutions be excluded the death rate is reduced to 19.4; the average rate per annum, however, for the last ten years has been 20.1 per thousand for London. Table I. shows the birth-rates and death-rates, together with the total number of births and deaths recorded for London and its five groups of sub-districts, together with those deaths belonging to London and yet occurring outside the Metropolis.

This is an uncertain means of calculation, but in default of an annual census it is the best at our disposal; at the present time the population of the Parish is probably over-estimated, and when the census is taken we shall find that the number is less than that above stated.

There is an increase of 8 in Camberwell, 75 in Peckham, and 66 in St. George's; the only district showing a decrease is Dulwich, where the births numbered 2 less than they did in 1894. The total number registered in the Parish in 1893 was 7,471. Table III.—Births in Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's.

In 1893 the birth-rate for the Parish was 30.1. Table IV.—Birth-Rates of Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Parish. Dulwich. St. George's. Camberwell.

The total number of deaths therefore due to the Parish, and from which the death-rate is calculated, amounts to 4,727. But when it comes to calculating the death-rates for the registration sub-districts, it is necessary to make certain corrections. There are, as Dr. Bristowe has pointed out in previous reports, a number of deaths which took place in the Infirmary and Workhouses, which are situated in the Camberwell sub-district, and these deaths are therefore included in its total; but only a certain proportion of these are of persons who had previously lived in the Camberwell division, while the remainder will be drawn from other parts of the Parish. I have consequently, following the example of my predecessor, re-distributed the deaths in those institutions, which amounted to 582, 364 being credited to the Infirmary, 120 to the Workhouses, and 98 to the Lunatic Asylums. The steps of this operation are shown on next page in tabular form. I have of course excluded altogether from my calculations those deaths which occurred in the St. Saviour's Infirmary, which practically is part of another Parish although it stands in Camberwell, and by its presence there causes a slight falsification of the death rate, since the inmates are reckoned as o forming part of the population of Camberwell in the census returns. The error, however, is too slight to call for any detailed notice. Table V. —Re-distribution of Deaths among Sub-Districts of Camberwell. Deaths in W. H. and L. A. subtracted. Deaths in W. H.and L.

It will be seen that the rate for the whole Parish is 1.87 per thousand more than 1894, but 1.36 less than in 1893. The death-rate for the whole of London is 2.0 per thousand more than in 1894, so that the increase is less marked in Camberwell than in the Metropolis generally. The figures for each of the districts are higher than in 1894, but those of Dulwich, Camberwell and St. George's are each less than those of 1893, only Peckham remaining about the same. The fact that last year showed a rise is by no means so disappointing as it appears, for if Tables VII. and VIII. are examined it will be seen that it is in the first quarter that the great increase took place. The memory of that severe weather is still fresh in the minds of all, and it is not necessary to further emphasize the prejudicial effect that this had on the public health. Again we had a very hot summer, which also showed its effects on the number of deaths in the third quarter, but the class of disease then fatal was not connected with the respiratory system, but consisted largely of the summer diarrhœa of children, which, according to Dr. Ballard, is always more prevalent when the temperature of the earth is high. Table VI.—Death-Rates in Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. St. George's. Parish. Dulwich. Peckham.

In accordance with the order of the Local Government Board I have inserted two tables drawn up on the form suggested by them for the period I have been your Medical Officer. Accidental or other violence caused 149 deaths as compared with 140 in 1894. Deaths returned as due to premature birth or defective vitality, and to convulsions of infancy, severally numbered 449 and 142, against 374 and 122 which were the respective figures for 1894. Twenty-seven deaths were attributed to the immediate or remote effects of child-birth, of this number 9 were certified as having occurred from puerperal fever or puerperal septicæmia. Twenty-five deaths were returned as due to erysipelas, pyæmia or allied diseases, and of this number 11 occurred in Institutions outside the Parish. Tubercular diseases, in which are included pulmonary consumption and the disease commonly called consumption of the bowels, caused 635 deaths, against 579 in 1894 and 680 in 1893; cancerous disease was credited with 194 deaths, against 181 in 1894 and 193 in 1893. Inflammatory affections of the lungs caused 945 deaths, against 716 in 1894 and 940 in 1893. Diarrhœal affections caused 254 deaths, against 115 in 1894 and 213 in 1893. It will be noted that there is a large increase in these two diseases, an increase amounting to 369, which goes far towards accounting for the augmented death-rate. The weather must be held largely responsible in this respect, for, as I have mentioned above, the coldness of the winter and the heat of the summer had a most favourable effect on the prevalence and increased mortality of lung troubles in the first case and of diarrhoea in the second. Tables X. and XI. give the annual mortality of the socalled zymotic diseases from the year 1856. The figures for the last six years being shown quarter by quarter. In Table XI. A. is given the mortality from these diseases for the whole of London, from this it will be seen that they all, with the exception of Influenza, show a decrease. It is, however, necessary to study them in detail in Camberwell. Hooping cough caused 61 deaths, as compared with 126 in 1894 and 104 in 1893. Thirteen of these deaths occurred in the first quarter, 22 in the second, 7 in the third, and 19 in the fourth; the figures for 1894 being respectively 29, 47, 41 and 9. The deaths from this disease amounted to 1 in Dulwich, 7 in Camberwell, 19 in Peckham and 34 in St. George's. Measles caused 100 deaths, against 164 in 1894 and 78 in 1893. In Dulwich there were no fatal cases, 27 occurred in Camberwell, 18 in Peckham and 55 in St. George's. They were distributed among the quarters of the year as follows: —3 occurred in the first, 3 in the second, 23 in the third and 71 in the fourth. Scarlatina caused 47 deaths, against 45 in 1894 and 80 in 1893, the majority of these took place in the last quarter of the year, when there were 20 deaths registered, as compared with 10 fatal cases in the third quarter, 9 in the second and 8 in the first. Fevers, chiefly typhoid or enteric, caused 30 deaths, against 21 in 1894 and 30 in 1893. Nine of these occurred in the first quarter, 3 in the second, 12 in the third and 6 in the last. Thirteen deaths belonged to Camberwell, 7 to Peckham and 10 to St. George's. In all, 7 deaths occurred from small pox, to which I shall refer specially. Diarrhœa and allied diseases caused 254 deaths, 231 of these occurring in children under the age of 5 years. In 1894 there were but 115 deaths, of which 98 were of children under 5. We have to look at the figures for the warm summer of 1893 for figures resembling those of the present year; in this year the deaths amounted to 214, of which 171 were children. More than two-thirds of the fatal cases took place in the third quarter of the year 1895, the season in which diarrhoea is almost invariably more prevalent than at any other time. There was but one fatal case in Dulwich, while the figures for Camberwell, Peckham and St. George's were 77, 82 and 93 respectively. The question naturally suggests itself as to whether the higher mortality in these districts in any way is due to the existence in greater proportion of sanitary defects. I should unhesitatingly state that in my opinion it is not, but that it is in great measure due to the far greater number of children of tender years in the three latter sub-districts. If we examine the numbers born in the several divisions of the Parish it will be seen that, roughly speaking, there were to each birth in Dulwich, 29 in each of the other districts. Now we have abundant proof that children in the first years of life are far more susceptible to fatal cases of diarrhoea, hence, granting a greater number of children, so surely shall we have a larger total of fatal cases of this disease. Again, it is impossible that children can have the same individual care when there is only the mother to nurse them, see to her other children and attend to her household duties. The only circumstance connected with the construction of the house that might play some part in the greater prevalence in these districts would be the fact that in the greater number of the poorer houses the best means for keeping food in a proper condition during hot weather are not present, and if they were possibly might not be used. Milk, which is the staple article of food of most of these cases, especially requires a place free from all possibility of contamination. If mothers and those in charge of children were to make a constant practice of boiling the milk I believe there would be a considerable diminution in the number of deaths ascribed to this disease. In connection with this I might point out the fact that some years ago an inquiry was made by the Medical Officer of Health of Liverpool into the incidence of the summer diarrhoea of children, and he found that nearly all the fatal cases were of children who were not fed from the breast. Those who were so fed usually escaped, although apparently they may have lived under far more insanitary conditions. Influenza caused 133 deaths in the year, of which 97 occurred in the first quarter, when the natural tendency of this disease towards the development of lung complications was much increased by the coldness of the weather. Six deaths occurred in Camberwell, 38 in Peckham and 24 in St. George's. I am glad to be able to note that there is no increase, and in many cases a decrease, in the mortality from nearly all infectious diseases, even compared with 1894. Dr. Bristowe in his report for that year states that these diseases, with the exception of hooping cough, measles and diphtheria, show a marked decrease, but this year there is only an appreciable increase in the figures for 1894 in the case of influenza, small pox and typhoid fever. Diphtheria is about the same, measles and hooping cough both show a decided diminution. Table XIII. shows the number of notifications received, which amounted to 2,494, as against 2,185 in 1894, 3,166 in 1893,2,307 in 1892 and 1,212 in 1891. The different diseases were represented by the following numbers: —86 of small pox, as against 16 in 1894; scarlet fever 885, against 946 in the previous year; 925 of diphtheria, against 745 in the previous year and 526 in 1893; 245 of typhoid fever, against 138 in 1894; 17 of puerperal fever, against 15 in the previous year; 332 of erysipelas, against 336 in 1894. In addition to the above, two notifications of English cholera were received, and an identical number of certificates of cases of continued fever. I have inserted a table giving the notifications of enteric fever, diphtheria and scarlet fever as they occurred in the different streets of the Parish. It will be marked that there was a considerable increase both in the notifications of and the deaths from typhoid fever; as is usual with this disease it was more prevalent in the latter half of the year, Altogether 113 out of the total of 245 notifications were received between the 3rd of August and the 26th of October; indeed at one time the number seemed so large that I instituted special inquiries with a view of discovering some common cause, but none was apparent. One fact did, however, show itself, and that was that a certain number of the cases were contracted outside Camberwell, usually at the seaside or in the country, where those attacked had gone for a change of air. In all 861 cases of infectious disease were removed to hospital, including 69 of small pox, 71 of typhoid fever, 357 of scarlet fever and 364 of diphtheria. Table XII. shows the work done by your Inspectors, who now number but 12 owing to the unhappy death of Inspector Dewey last year. The house-to-house inspections numbered 6,904, against 12,843 in 1894, while the inspections arising from complaints numbered 2,883, against 1,965 in 1894. There is a considerable falling off in the figures for 1894 for the house-to house inspections, but against this we have an increased number of inspections arising from complaints that have reached us. Some of these complaints of course are of a very trifling character and require but little done to remove their cause, others on the contrary, and these form not the least portion, lead to a whole block of houses being put into proper order. All this of course takes up much of your Inspectors' time. Again, we had 14 Inspectors for the whole of 1894, except in November and December, when we had 13, a number we retained until July, 1895, when your staff was reduced to 12. The frost, too, was a great hindrance to sanitary work, for not only was it impossible to properly make joints or do any paving or other work requiring the use of cement, but water was not available for testing purposes. Under these circumstances it appears that just as much work has been done, especially when we look at the total number of primary inspections, which is almost identical with that of 1894, when allowance has been made for the lesser number of Inspectors. I should particularly point out that a considerable portion of time was necessarily occupied in dealing with the question of the absence of water supply, and the furnishing of evidence for the Local Government Board inquiry, indeed some of the Inspectors visited as many as 500 houses on this matter. It appears that there were 50,017 re-inspections of works in progress, this number including houses in which notifiable diseases had been or were prevailing; and 965 inspections and re-inspections of new buildings, a part of our duty which takes up a considerable amount of time which the numbers in this report do not accurately represent. In connection with the above inspections it was found necessary to serve 5,090 intimations under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and 877 notices under this Act and the Metropolis Local Management Acts; but in only 125 cases was it found necessary to follow up these proceedings by the issue of a summons. During the year the drains of 1,249 houses were partially or totally reconstructed, the work being carried out in accordance with the Vestry's regulations. The numbers credited to each inspector are shown in Table B. Table C shows the various kinds of sanitary work carried out, and Table D the numbers of samples that your Inspectors have submitted to the Analyst and the number of summonses taken out in connection with the Food and Drugs Act. The returns bear witness to the large amount of clerical work which has been done by the two clerks. 2,494 cases of infectious disease were notified to the Asylums Board, and 2,104 certificates sent to the various schools stating that children from houses where infectious disease existed were attending their school. 1,257 intimations to schools of disinfection having been carried out and 4,205 notices of infectious diseases were served on the occupiers of infected houses, forming a total of 10,060 notices concerning notifiable diseases. In all 545 inspections of bakehouses were made by your Inspectors, and in addition to this I have personally inspected 167 of them during the past year. Owing to the attention which has always been given to them in this Parish, their condition taken as a whole is by no means so bad as we read of as existing in other portions of the Metropolis, and the faults that we have had to find have chiefly been the want of cleanliness as exhibited in allowing accumulation underneath the troughs, and very occasionally the dirty state of the walls and ceiling. 9,662 letters were received and 12,639 sent out. In accordance with your instructions the cow-houses and slaughter-houses were inspected last September with a view of opposing the renewal of the licenses of all those that did not comply with the Vestry's regulations. In the case of 16 slaughter-houses and 13 cow-houses I did not consider it necessary to serve any notices. As regards the remainder, the works necessary chieflyconsisted of the provision of proper manure pits and the proper paving of the yards in connection with the buildings, and intimations were accordingly sent to the respective owners. In 9 cases the work had not been completed to our satisfaction on the day appointed for our giving notice to the County Council of the Vestry's intention to oppose the license. By the day of hearing the applications the work had been done satisfactorily in all but three instances; these were adjourned for three weeks by Licensing Committee, and at the end of that time we were able to withdraw all opposition. In connection with cases of infectious disease I have to report that 1,709 houses and 2,190 lots of bedding were disinfected during the year, and it is with pleasure that I have to state that notwithstanding the difficulties of their duties, not a single complaint has been made against your disinfecting staff. I must commend to the approval of the Vestry the work done by the Inspectors during the past year; their task is always difficult and often unpleasant. I have to express my thanks to them for much assistance, inspections and other work, and also to the two clerks, to whom I am largely indebted for the figures of this report, and of whose careful attention to the clerical work I can only speak with admiration. This report would not be fittingly ended were I to omit to pay a tribute of respect and admiration to the memory of my distinguished predecessor. Dr. Bristowe enjoyed a world-wide reputation as a physician and as a writer, and he would equally be regarded as an authority on Public Health, if it were only realised how much he did for the sanitary state of Camberwell. He came at a time when there were no stringent sanitary laws to enforce his opinion and no public opinion in sanitary matters to assist him, and he was opposed by strong interests. The first he lived to see passed, while he was instrumental in promoting the second, and by his geniality of manner, no less than by the force and cogency of his arguments he succeeded in breaking down much of the opposition with which he was at first confronted. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FRANCIS STEVENS. 202 TABLE X. ANNUAL MORTALITY RETURN OF ZYMOTIC DISEASES, FROM 1856 (inclusive). Diarrhœa. Small Pox. Hooping Cough. Measles.
