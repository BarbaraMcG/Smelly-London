A REPORT Of the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., for the year ending Ladyday, 1871. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. N.B.—The Medical Officer's and Sanitary Reports will he issued separately REPORT OF THE YESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, In presenting my Annual Report of the proceedings of the Vestry for the year ending- Lady-day last, I will first direct your attention to the past and present financial condition of the parish, and furnish some data from which we may deduce some idea of its future prospects. FINANCIAL REVIEW. The Income derived from the Poor Rate, for the year ending Ladyday, 1870, amounted to £73,099 7s. 9d.; the Expenditure during the same period was £73,169 10s. 2d., £10,913 of which was to discharge a balance due to the Treasurer at Lady-day, 1869. For the year ending Lady-day last, the receipts from the Poor Rate, including sale of Engine house, were £68,589 2s. 11d.; the expenditure £69,440 17s. 1d. The particulars will be found in a table given in the Accountant's report. The receipts from the Vestry Rates, for the year ending 1870, were £39,363, and from all other sources, including balances, £59,908 2s. 3d. the expenditure for all purposes, was £52,426 15s. 8d., or about £13,000 more than was raised by rates; this excess of expenditure was owing to about £11,300 raised by loan and expended on new paving, and £9,300 to the Metropolitan Board, by which the cash balances were reduced in round numbers from £17,000 to £7,500. During the past year the receipts from the Vestry rates and other sources, have been, exclusive of balances, £47,660 5s. 1d., and the expenditure £50,132 2s. 3d., by which the balances have been reduced to £2472. 6 Lady-day last terminates a period in the financial administration of Shoreditch, which seems to be a fitting time to take a brief review of the past, and to glance at the increase of local taxation and its causes. The peculiarity of this particular period, is that it terminates a system of local assessment which has been in operation from time immemorial, and was almost peculiar to this parish, and commences a new system established by Act of Parliament, and uniform throughout the metropolis. It was formerly the practice to make a deduction of one-third from the supposed rental of premises, to arrive at the rateable value upon which the local rates were levied. It is obvious that the weight of taxation is not to be altogether calculated by the mere proportion to the pound which a rate bears, but the number of pounds must be also considered. A rate of 1s. in the pound on £15, is just the same as a rate of 9d. on £20. In order, therefore, to determine the weight of taxation, we must consider upon what basis it is levied. In Shoredtich a £30 house was formerly rated at £20, and a shilling rate was 20s.; now under the new Assessment Act, a £30 house is to be rated at £24, and if all assessments were raised in that proportion, a rate of 10d., on the larger assessment, should suffice to raise the same amount as required by a rate of 1s. on the larger. The increase in the rateable value of the parish by the operation of the new Act is £59,821; and, in point of fact, a ten-penny rate should now produce under this assessment £80 more than a shilling rate did under that which was in force prior to Lady-day last. In an annual report, speculations as to the future would be out of place, but the following table will show in what manner the increase in the amount, or in the value of property, has progressed, as well as the increase in the rate of local taxation. It will be seen that the expenditure for works, etc., by the Yestry has remained nearly stationary, or has been augmented only in due proportion to the increasing exigences of a populous town, and to meet the obligations which recent enactments have thrown upon it. But that an enormous increase has taken place in the poor rate, and that mainly in that portion of it which is devoted to the maintenance of pauperism. The facts only are given here, speculations as to the causes are left for the ratepayers to pursue. ST. LEONARD, SHOREDITCH.

In the last 1½ years there is included in the gross amount levied the allowance of 30 per cent, to landlords. The details will be found in the Accountant's Statement. 8 THE NEW ASSESSMENT. I have explained above the origin and general principles of the new assessment; the results of the same are as follows:— County Rate Assessment, Prior Parochial Assessment, Prior to Lady-day last £446,420 to Lady-day last £389,840* Subsequent to ditto £440,089 Subsequent to ditto £440,689 Decrease £5,751 Increase £50,849 * In this is included the London and North Western Railway, which reduces the figure £9,500, and adds the same amount to the increase. Now, inasmuch as the County Hates, Police, Lunatics, Main Drainage, Fire Brigade, &c. charges, were levied m the County assessment, which was a figure fixed by the County bench, and had some £ relation to the property tax, but very little to the parochical assessment, but which will now be levied upon the hatter basis, it will be seen that the standard of charge has been reduced by the new assessment; and when it is stated that the former total of the County assessment was £18,683,288, and the present is £19,812,057, or an increase of £1,128,769, and that a penny rate on the increased assessment of the metropolis will produce £4,703, it must be obvious that the position of Shoreditch, in relation to metropolitan taxation, has improved. "With regard to the considerable increase in the rateable value of the parish, nearly £60,000, if it could be accepted as a fair and equal increase, over the entire parish; or, better still, a more carefully adjusted and equitable assessment of the property, the mere fact of the increase would not be worthy of a moment's consideration, inasmuch, as the whole of the money raised upon that increase will be devoted to internal parochial uses, and it is just the question of a shilling on £20, or a tenpenny rate on £24. I have, however, grave reason to fear that the present parochial assessment is not fair or equitable between a large number of parishioners. From returns furnished by the ratepayers, the Surveyor of Government Taxes made an alteration of about 4,000 assessments, nearly all of which were raised; and although in all such cases forms for notice of appeal were sent to the parties, many neglected to do so until the rates were demanded, on the increase, and the time for 9 appeal had passed. Under these circumstances the Assessment Committee could but deal with the materials before them, the opportunity to obtain more reliable materials, which Would have cost some money, was not embraced, and the staff in preparing the new assessment, could but work out those materials to their legitimate results; and to this cause, as well as to the ratepayers' own neglect must be attributed much of the dissatisfaction which certainly prevails with regard to the new assessment. The entire revision of the Assessment was carried out, and without appeal with one exception, by the Assessment Committee, the exception was the Regent Canal Company's property, which had formerly been assessed at £90, was raised by the Assessment Committee to £2400, and settled by the Assessment Sessions at £738. The question in dispute was not in regard to estimates of value, but as to the basis of calculation, and involved an interpretation of an Act of Parliament. The Law being ascertained, the parties agreed, and each paid their own costs. A long and harassing appeal, which had been pending for two and a half vt;ars, was decided in April last: the London and North Western Railway v. the Parish, as to the assessment of the Company's Station in Broad Street. The Parish Surveyors fixed the rateable value at £15,000, proceeding upon the basis of value of land and cost of works. The Company stood upon the letting value, and brought evidence to prove that the station earned no money as profit, and consequently had little or no value to a hypothetical tenant, and the Court of Quarter Sessions, presided over by Sir W. Bodkin, taking, apparently, and acting upon a similar view, reduced the rateable value to £5500, each party paying costs. The parochial authorities are dissatisfied with this result, and it is not improbable that the question may again be raised. LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. Not many legislative changes affecting parochial management have come into operation during last year, nor are many likely to be effected this year, though several have been proposed. The Assessment Act has been fully explained, the Elementary Education Act has passed, and the School Board has been elected, and is in operation. The 10 Parochial Officers were not required by the Act to take any part in the election of the Members of that Board, except to furnish the Rate Books and the attendance of the Collectors, but being requested to assist the Returning Officer of Hackney in the election as regards Shoreditch, I and a portion of the vestry's staff readily did so, and we had the satisfaction of knowing that the election in Shoreditch was conducted to the satisfaction of all the candidates, and with far less complaints, as to arrangements, than were made respecting many other districts in the Metropolis. The Yestry has received a precept requiring it to pay £882 13s. 2d. to the School Board, towards its general expenses. This is a charge upon the Yestry Rate. A new Jury Act came into operation this year, but subsequently to the preparation of the Jury List for the year. Hence, so far as the preparation of the List, it has not in this Parish been acted upon. The next List must be prepared in accordance with it, the chief features of it are, first, that the assessment to the Inhabited House duty again becomes a qualification, and this and the increase in the Poor Rate assessment will, perhaps, swell the List by some hundreds of names. The other feature is, that the Overseers are to indicate those entitled to serve on Special Juries, which was a duty formerly performed in the Sheriffs' department. Some other proposals have been made in Parliament, regarding Registration of Yoters, the Ballot, Election Expenses, Local Government, etc., but if they have any result, it will be more in place to notice them in the next year's report. PRIVATE BILL LEGISLATION. The only Railway Bill, affecting the Parish of Shoreditch, introduced during the Sessions 1870—71, was the North London Railway Additional Powers Bill, but which so slightly concerned it, that it was not considered necessary to oppose it. The matter of Tramways appears now to command the greatest attention from the speculative world, and have been brought prominently before the Legislature. Considerable powers have already been granted 11 by Parliament to Metropolitan Companies, and many additional schemes were submitted during this Session. Four schemes were promoted affecting the Parish of Shoreditch:— 1st.—The Commercial Road East scheme, which proposed to run from the Shoreditch end of Commercial Street to Poplar. It but very slightly affected Shoreditch, having but about 150 yards of projected tram within the Parish. 2nd.—The North Metropolitan Tramway scheme. This Company had already obtained running powers from Stratford to Aldgate, and from Holloway via City Road to the City, and some smaller and feeding lines. The promoters now sought powers to construct a line from Threadneedle Street, via Shoreditch, thence to Stamford Hill by two lines, one through Hackney Road, Hackney and Clapton; and one by the direct road, via Kingsland, Newington, etc.: also a line from the City Road, via East Road, New North Road, Bridport Place, Southgate Road, to Mildmay Park; and some cross lines which need not be specified. 3rd.—The North Eastern Metropolitan scheme, which adopted a large portion of the North Metropolitan scheme, and extended it to Tottenham and Alexandra Park. 4th.—The North-East of London and the Columbia Market Approaches scheme, which proposed a line of trams somewhat resembling the North Metropolitan scheme, and some additional works and improvements and tramways in connection with Columbia Market. Before the proposals were submitted to Parliament, the NorthEastern and the North-East of London and Columbia Market Approaches scheme were amalgamated. The Yestry opposed the Commercial Road and the North-Eastern schemes, as not affording to the locality its proper requirements, and gave a qualified assent to the North Metropolitan and to the NorthEastern and Columbia Market scheme. The Committee of the House of Commons rejected all the Bills 12 except the North Metropolitan, and so much of the Columbia Market scheme, as proposed certain widenings and a connecting line of tramway with the Groat Eastern Railway, not within the Parish of Shoreditch. The North Metropolitan scheme, as passed by the House of Commons, authorised lines from Threadneedlo Street, through Shoreditch, Hackney Road and Kingsland Road, to Clapton and Stamford Hill; from Shoreditch Church to Goswell Street, through Old Street Road; and from the City Road, to the Green Lanes, via East Road, New North Road and Bridport Place, and several other lines in other Parishes. Through a misapprehension as regards standing orders, the Vestry did not appear in the House of Commons against these Bills, but the Improvement Committee and the officers were in constant negotiation with the promoters. Terms as to compensation for use of pavement were made by other parishes and the promoters, which the Parish of Shoreditch, with certain modifications, also demanded. It was, however, found necessary to appear against tho Bill in the House of Lords, the result of whioh was that terms were then arranged ; they are, That the Company shall pay to tho Yestry tho sum of 9/- per yard, superficial, for tho pavement to be occupied by the Tramway, to bo taken as seventeen feet wide for doublo line, and eight feet for single line, to pave the macadam roads to a certain width, and to pay tho cost of asphalting a portion of Old Street Road, for tho stipulated width, if tho same is so pavod by the Vestry. I estimate that tho money payments to be made by the Company to the Vestry, will bo £7500, and the value of New Paving nearly £3000. I should observe, that the Lords' Committee rejected that part of tho schemo, which proposed to carry the line from Shoreditch Church to Threadneedlo Street. Tho Bill, as amended, has received tho Royal aasent. LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS. During tho year two improvements in the Parish have been effected ; one, the Shepherdess Walk improvement, by the Metropolitan Board, and the other, tho Huntingdon Street, by the Vestry, aided by a contribution from tho Metropolitan Board. 13 The Shepherdess Walk Improvement. This Improvement was undertaken at the request of the Vestries of Shoreditch and St. Luke's, and of the inhabitants of those Parishes and Islington. It consisted in the purchase of a strip of land occupied by St. Luke's Workhouse, and the setting back of the wall and buildings thereon to the extent of some 15-feet, thus giving a roadway of 40-feet in width. The amount paid by the Metropolitan Board to the St. Luke's Guardians, and other parties having an interest therein, was about £14,000. The improvement also involves the removal of the fore-courts of Lady Lumley's Almshouses, on the East side of Shepherdess Walk, and the Board is now in negociation with the Parishes of Bishopsgate Street and Aldgate, to which the Almshouses belong, for the purchase and removal of those fore-courts. The Metropolitan Board undertook to kerb and pave the footways, and to macadamise the roadway of the widened portion of the road, and the engineer's estimate of the cost of such work was £2500. The Vestry's Representatives, Messrs. Hows and Dodd, considered that such estimate was excessive for macadam, and that the carriage way might be paved with granite cubes for about the same amount, and they brought the matter under the consideration of the Vestry, the Vestry's contractor having made an offer to perform the whole of the work for £2500, The Vestry made a similar offer to the Metropolitan Board, which was accepted, and the paving of the foot and carriage way was entrusted to the Vestry, the Metropolitan Board agreeing to pay the Vestry the stipulated price of £2500, when the work should be completed to the satisfaction of the Board's engineer. The whole of the work has been executed except the removal of the fore-courts of the almshouses, and the paving of the site of the same. The Metropolitan Board has paid the Vestry the sum of £2400 on account, which has been paid to the contractor. Huntingdon Street Improvement. The leases of the greater portion of the estate of Sir John Tyssen Tyrell, Bart., situate between Hoxton Street and Kingsland Road, having nearly expired, the freeholder obtained possession of the property, removed the greater portion of the dwellings then standing, which were 14 of a very small and ill-conditioned character, and re-let the ground for re-building. Huntingdon Street and Great Essex Street were two thoroughfares on this estate, of a width of about 24-feet, both of which are in course of re-building. The Vestry entered into negociations with the agents of the owner, and concluded an arrangement for the purchase of so much ground on the North side of Huntingdon Street, as would suffice to widen that street to about 40-feet, exclusive of the areas, which give an additional width of 10 or 12-feet from house to house. This street is situate opposite Thomas Street at one end, and nearly opposite to Myrtle Street at the other, and in the event of the former being eventually opened for vehicular traffic, will form part of an important lino of communication leading from Hoxton to Hackney Road. The Vestry agreed to pay the freeholder for the widening of this street £4415 10s., being principally for property which had to be removed or re-built, to bo paid in three instalments, two of which have been paid, and the third will be payable at Christmas, 1872, or sooner if the whole of the land included in the deed of purchase can be rendered available. The Metropolitan Board agreed to contribute one half of the cost of this improvement (£2207 15s.), and have paid the sum of £1000 on account. The legal and surveyor's charges were £126 6s. 1d., and the works in connection therewith are estimated at about £800; the whole amount paid by the Vestry was drawn from the current rates and not raised by loan. Several other local improvements have been under the consideration of the Improvement Committee, such as the widening of the Rosemary Branch and Cat-and-Mutton Bridges, over the Regent's Canal; the widening of the Hackney end of Goldsmith's Row, and of Red Lion Passage in Hoxton. No practical step has been taken to advance any of the former, but the latter has been virtually resolved upon, to be effected by giving up a portion of the ground belonging to the Parish, used as a Stone Yard; the Passage will be widened from 3-feet to 8-feet. METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS, SHOREDITCH. Metropolitan Improvements are distinguished from Local Improvements by their being of a larger extent, more general in their character, 15 and effected by the Metropolitan Board, at the cost of the Metropolis at large. Local improvements being effected by the Local Authorities, aided by a contribution from the Central Board. In this latter sense the Shepherdess Walk was a Metropolitan Improvement; with this exception, Metropolitan Improvements in Shoreditch are, as yet, only projected. The necessity of widening the narrow end of High Street, Shoreditch, into which the Hackney and Kingsland Roads and Old Street Road discharge their principal traffic, and also of continuing the communication from the East of London, partly provided by Commercial Street, through, in the direction of Willow Walk to Old Street Road or City Road, whence it would be continued by Old Street, and possibly, through Wilderness Row to Bloomsbury, has long been felt and acknowledged, and has been made the subject of discussion in Committees of the House of Commons, by the Commissioners of Works, and by the Metropolitan Board. During the past year, the Vestry of Shoreditch took vigorous action in the matter of both proposals, brought them under the consideration of the Metropolitan Board, by memorials and deputations, and prepared and submitted detailed plans and estimates necessary for placing the proposals before Parliament. During the consideration of these proposals by the Metropolitan Board, the Vestry judged that it would be inadvisable to press both schemes to an issue that year, but to waive, for the present, one, in favor of an immediate accomplishment of the other. The proposal adopted for instant action, was the widening of the High Street, as being the most urgent and useful. The Vestry was so far successful, as to induce the Metropolitan Board to decide by a very large majority to adopt the proposal as a Metropolitan Improvement, and to introduce a Bill into Parliament to authorise the same, and the necessary capital to be raised. In their efforts the Vestry of Shoreditch was handsomely assisted by the Board of Works and Vestry of Hackney, the Vestries of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, and St. Lukes, the Holborn Board of Works, and by Miss (now the Baroness) Burdett Coutts, and the Committee of Columbia Market, all of whom memorialized the Board of Works, or petitioned Parliament in its favor. It was not anticipated that so urgent an improvement, especially located at the East of London, which district 16 has contributed much towards the West, and has received but little in return, would meet with any opposition in Parliament, and the Vestry was astonished to find that an antagonistic movement was fostered in the House itself, ostensibly led by Mr. Groldney, Member for Chippenham, and Mr. Locke, Member for Southwark, who succeeded in obtaining the appointment of a large Committee, and treating the Bill as of a hybrid character, and the first-named Member being appointed Chairman, those two gentlemen persistently led the opposition throughout. The Vestry of St. Mary, Islington and the Board of Works of Plumstead, opposed the Bill, and appeared by Counsel against it. Had the Bill have been dealt with as an ordinary private Bill, and referred to a Select Committee in the usual way, neither of those opposing parties would have had any locus standi, and it is not considered that under any circumstances their opposition would have had any weight with a purely unbiassed Committee. But the course they took served to enable Mr. Goldney and Mr. Locke to suggest reasons for rejecting the Bill, which they did. Two Members voting for the passing, viz., Mr. Headlam and Dr. Brewer, and six against it, viz., Mr. Groldney, Mr. Cowper Temple, Mr. Locke, Lord Elcho, Mr. Fellows, and Mr Morrison. Two others were absent when the decision was given. The following is the Resolution of the Committee, by which the Bill was rejected:— "That the widening of High Street, Shoreditch, although in " itself an important improvement of an arterial communication, " does not appear to have been considered as part of a general plan " for the improvement of the thoroughfares of the Metropolis, or to " have been compared in point of urgency with other similar im" provements, and being proposed on a different footing from other " improvements of a similar nature, which have been paid for partly " by contributions from the districts and partly from the general " rates, it is expedient that, before granting to the Metropolitan " Board of Works the powers sought for by the 'Metropolitan " Board of Works (Shoreditoh Improvement) Bill,' a general plan " for the improvement of the main communications of the Metro" polis, and the mode in which the cost of such improvements " should be apportioned between the whole Metropolis and tho 17 " districts more immediately and locally benefited, should be pre- " pared by the Board and submitted to Parliament." Efforts were made, but unsuccessfully, to obtain the recommittal of the Bill. Mr. John Holms, the Member for Hackney, however, moved and obtained an order for the printing of the evidence, and any person desirous of judging whether the Bill was fairly considered and rejected on its merits, or by reason of a foregone conclusion, and for ulterior purposes, is referred to that document, which may be obtained at the Parliamentary printers, at nine-pence per copy. Of course, it would be wrong and ill-advised to endeavour to limit the right or discretion of the House of Commons to enquire fully into the character and scope of every project submitted to it, which involves the raising and expenditure of public money, whether it be derived from local or national taxation; but it does seem hard, if not unjust to the Parish of Shoreditch and other districts such as Hackney and Bethnal Green, who are interested in the improvement of this arterial thoroughfare, that the application to Parliament for a Bill, authorizing this very urgent work, at a cost of about £275,000, to be spread over the entire Metropolis, and over a period of sixty years, should have been made the occasion and pretence for a searching and antagonistic enquiry into the whole policy of the Metropolitan Board in respect to public improvements, when it is considered that the East End has contributed heavily, both by direct and indirect taxation, to the revenue of the Metropolitan Board, which funds have been expended in the construction of the Thames Embankment, the improvement of Kensington and Park Lane, of Covent Garden, Southwark Street, and Holborn, and the formation of Southwark and Finsbury Parks. The only East End exception being a comparatively cheap New Road from Limehouse to Mile End, and the opening of the Commercial Road into Whitechapel, and the small affair of Shepherdess Walk, which latter trifle is all that the Parishes of Shoreditch, Hackney, Bethnal Green, and St. Lukes have collectively obtained in the shape of Metropolitan Improvement. It is evident from the course taken by the Metropolitan Board in respect to the Shoreditch Improvement, that that Authority is desirous of rendering an instalment of justice to the North-East of London, and 18 whether it will act upon the suggestion given in the Committee's report, and bring forward a more general and extensive plan, or will only propose isolated improvements, there is very little doubt that the widening of the High Street of this Parish will bo again submitted to Parliament in the Session of 1872. The New Street from Shoreditch to Old Street Road or City Road will, very probably, also bo brought under the notice of the Metropolitan Board this year, and if the Bloomsbury Communication is considered as part of a general scheme, it would bo necessary to include this short length as part of that general line which would bo otherwise left incomplete. THE TOWN HALL. Between Lady-day, 1870, and the same period this year, the Public Hall has been lot 217 times, and the Council Chamber 20. There have been Vestry Meetings, besides many Meetings of the Vestry Committees, and others of a private or non-parochial character. The receipts for letting the Hall for the year were £906 5s. It must be remembered that a considerable amount of the cost of heating, lighting, cleansing, repairing, and attending the Hall, is incidental to the business of the Parish, and would be incurred if the establishment was used for none but parochial purposes. I suggested in my last report that some course might bo taken to encourage the more profitable letting of the Hall, but I cannot say that as yet any stop has been taken in that direction. PROPOSED MORTUARY. The Medical Officer has long urged the provision of a Public Mortuary, as a great sanitary necessity, and the Vestry has endeavoured to provide one, but the difficulty of securing a site has hitherto prevented that object from being realised. Negociations for the erection of one in the Church-yard of St. Leonard, failed from various causes. The Vicar and Churchwardens of St. John's, Hoxton, very liberally gave their consent for the erection of an ornamental building in the Burial-ground of that Church, provided that the inhabitants of that district parish, 19 would consent. But upon the proposal being submitted to a meeting, it was rejected by a large majority, and as far as St. John's was concerned, there was an end of the project. Negociations with the North London Railway for a site of ground in rear of the Town Hall, have not yet assumed a definite shape, and for the present the subject stands in abeyance. SMALL POX TEMPORARY HOSPITAL. Towards the end of 1870 the Metropolis was visited with a severe attack of Small Pox, and Shoreditch was one of the earliest and then most severely afflicted districts. The Medical Officer will, no doubt, treat of this exceptional event fully in his report. I propose here only to allude to the means taken to meet the attack, and the expenses attending them. The accommodation provided by tho Metropolitan Asylum Board for the reception of Small Pox patients, was by no means adequate to the demand, and it became necessary for the Local Authorities to supplement that accommodation by other temporary hospitals. The Medical Officer pressed upon the Vestry the extreme urgency of such a provision in Shoreditch, and after an attempt to acquire several places in or near to the Parish, which failed, it was decided by agreement with the Charity Trustees, to erect a wooden building on the site of the old Burial-ground in the Hackney Road, using the present almshouses for the accommodation of the Medical attendant and the Nursing staff, temporary provision being made for the inmates of the almshouses elsewhere. Possession was taken of the ground on the 20th of January, and the building was opened for the reception of patients in ten days. The Medical Officer will, no doubt, furnish details as to the hygenic results. I may, however, observe, that it was originally intended for the accommodation of persons who were not paupers, but who were unprovided with proper accommodation, and were, consequently, a source of public danger. It was found that the distinction between the pauper and the non-pauper class could not be rigidly maintained, and considerable aid was afforded to the Board of Guardians by means of this hospital. The building was prepared for forty beds, at a cost, including fitting of the house, etc., of £663 10s. 6d.; the total cost of the hospital from the commencement, including building, 20 medical attendance, nurses, provisions, etc., to its closing on the 26th May, was £1406 15s. 8d. 169 patients were admitted, several of whom paid for admission a fee, varifying from £1 to £5 5s. The total amount of fees was £61 19s. 6. The nursing superintendence was kindly and gratuitously undertaken by tho ladies of St. Saviour's Priory, naggerstone, who diligently attended to the duties and gave every satisfaction ; for which the Yestry passed a cordial vote of thanks. The cost of watching the building and providing for the lodging of the inmates of the almshouses, is 23/- per week. The Vestry is under an agreement to properly restore the almshouses, against the cost of which may bo set the amount which the old material will realise. It is not yet determined what shall bo done with the building, and there are apprehensions that it may, unfortunately, bo required for a Cholera Hospital. DISORDERLY HOUSES. In August last, the inhabitants of High Street, Shoreditch, and other places, made representations to the Yestry, in reference to the great scandal, annoyance, and injury created by the existence of disorderly houses, and the inmates openly flaunting themselves and plying their immoral vocation in the open streets, and the Yestry instructed me to take measures to make an example of some of the most notorious offenders. Accordingly I obtained warrants and effected the summary arrest of eight persons, four from New Norfolk Street, Shoreditch, one from Holywell Lane, one from Britannia Street, and two from Westmoreland Place. The whole were committed for trial at the Middlesex Sessions, and pleaded guilty. They were required to find bail for their appearance in a month to receive judgment. Several were unable to procure it and so remained in custody. On their re-appearance it was admitted that the whole of the accused had closed their houses, and many others had taken the warning which it was the object of the prosecution to give, and no further penalty was asked for. The officers of the Cir and N Divisions of Police rendered considerable assistance, in promptly arresting these parties and furnishing evidence against them, 21 and the Vestry voted a gratuity of £5 to the officers employed in each Division. The cost of these prosecutions was £63. Since the close of the year to which this report relates, I felt it again necessary, in compliance with the request of many respectable inhabitants, to exercise the discretion with which the Yestry entrusted me, and caused the arrest of six other notorious offenders. Two from the East road, who had kept several houses, and who were defended by counsel, were found guilty and sentenced to twelve months' hard labor each and a fine of fifty pounds. Three taken from the Yinegar Ground pleaded guilty, and were sentenced each to four months' hard labor; and one from Nancy Street, a woman, pleaded guilty, and was ordered to find bail to come up for judgment when called upon. The result of these prosecutions has been, to suppress some of the vilest homes of vice in the metropolis. Many others have also taken the alarm and disappeared. I have, however, received complaints from respectable inhabitants of the existence of others, the keepers of which seem inclined to risk the consequences, and upon whom, probably, in due time, the hand of the law will fall heavily. As the preliminaries to these movements cannot be discussed in the Vestry without defeating their object, I have to express my sense of the confidence which the Vestry has manifested in me, by leaving in my hands the discretion of putting into execution a law of such summary and serious character. CONTRACTS. Appended hereto, will be found a list of the contracts entered into by the Vestry for the year. Except the watering and the scavenging, they were taken from Lady-day to Lady-day. The contractor for scavenging and dusting performed his duties so unsatisfactorily, that the Vestry, in the middle of the Lady-day quarter of his year, was compelled to employ other persons to do the work, and at Lady-day to terminate the contract entirely, the contractor having in the mean time become bankrupt. New contracts were then taken by Mr. Crane, for the West Division for £2655, and Messrs. Stroud, for the East Division for £3000. The Vestry paid for the work occasioned by the default of the contractor £909 5s. 3d., or £34 5s. 3d. more than the amount payable to 22 the contractor for the quarter; but as the work was evidently taken at a less amount than it could be properly executed for, it was not considered necessary to incur the cost and trouble in claiming the difference against the bankrupt's estate. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, E. WALKER, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Clerk's Offices— Town Hall, St. Leonard, Shoreditch. June 30th, 1871. 23 REPORT OF THE ACCOUNTANT. To the Vestry of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, Gentlemen, I beg, herewith, to submit, or the information of the Vestry, the annual tabular statements, classified under distinct headings, shewing the gross receipts from all sources to the Vestry exchequer, likewise the disbursements under their orders, during the financial year of the business of the Vestry, ending the 25th day of March last. In the first place, the amount raised by rates alone shews £110,572 4s. 4d., and from other sources, including contributions from the Metropolitan Board of Works, £3,400 towards public improvements in the Parish. The amount paid by various persons for hire of the Town Hall was £916 5s. as against £637 1s. 2d. during the previous year, being an increase of £279 3s. 10d. The total receipts are £116,249 8s. The chief items in the expenditure may be briefly ennumerated, as follows: Payments to the Guardians under contribution orders £49,000, to the Treasurer for the County of Middlesex, County Rate, £5,580 5s.; Police Rate, £12,651 8s. 9d; Collectors' poundage and salaries, £1,822 16s. 9d.; repayments of Loans and Interest, £8,623 15s.; the Metropolitan Board of Works, £9,167 17s. 11d., in which sum is now included Main Drainage precepts. The improvements in Shepherdess Walk, Huntingdon and Essex Streets, likewise that contemplated in the High Street. Shoreditch, cost £4467 17s. 5d., with other payments, not here specially mentioned, brings the gross disbursements under 24 Vestry orders from the Poor Rate, £69,370 14s. 8d., Vestry Rates, £48,748 9s. 1d., or a gross total of £118,119 3s. 9d. The amounts standing as uncollected on the Rates at Lady-day last were, Vestry Rates £9,280 8s. 9d., Poor Rate £27,600 11s. 10d., making together £36,881 0s. 7d., as against £51,044 19s. at March 1870, shewing a decrease of £14,163 18s. 5d., which is doubtless attributable to the system which has from time to time been pointed out by the Vestry Clerk, and is now being carried out, whereby a more speedy mode of collection, and the issue of the collecting books and receipts several weeks earlier in the quarter than hitherto, and which is hoped will prove beneficial to the resident Ratepayers of the Parish. The intention being to have the Rate collected during the quarter for which it is made, and to enforce payment on those who would decamp after a lapse of several months occupation, without payment of their just quota. By reference to one of the appended Tables it will be seen, that a no less sum than £5373 11s. 6d. is accounted for as losses by removals and empties on one year's assessment, which by a closer system of collection, such heavy deficiencies cannot otherwise than be materially reduced, and the local taxation more equitably distributed.

JAMES PETTET GEORGE FREDERICK DEFRIEZ w. e. cole, Accountant to the Vestry. 29 SURVEYOR'S REPORT. Surveyor's Department. Gentlemen, Herewith I append a summary of the work carried out under the superintendence of this department for the year ending 25th March, 1871:— Watering the Roads, Streets, &c. The whole of the Parish was thoroughly and efficiently watered from the 1st March to the 31st of October, 1870, by Mr. Henry Crane, of George Street, London Fields, (under a contract,) for the sum of £950. During the whole season, as above, there were only seven complaints made of insufficient watering, and those were promptly attended to. There are seventeen hydrants in the Parish belonging to the Vestry, twelve supplied by the New River Company, and five by the East London Water Company, and the cost of keeping them in repair was £26 0s. 7d. for the season. 11,427,000 gallons of water was spread on the roads, streets, &c. 8,326,000 supplied by the New River Company, at a cost of £416 10s. 6d. and 3,101,000 by the East London Water Company, at a cost of £126 15s. 9d., making total cost of water £543 6s. 3d. Total amount paid for watering was £1519 6s. 10d. 30 Dusting and Scavenging, &c. The first quarter of the year the work of cleansing the whole Parish, removing the dust, and cleansing the gullies was carried out by Mr. William Winn, of Gloucester Street, Curtain Road, (under a contract), for the sum of £875 for the quarter. The Vestry then entered into a contract for dusting and scavenging &c. the whole Parish with Mr. William Clilverd, of Acorn Wharf, Great Cambridge Street, for one year, from the 24th June, 1870, to the 24th June, 1871, for the sum of £3,500. The first three months under this contract the work was performed exceedingly well, in the second three months there was a slight falling off, but altogether the work for this period was very fairly done, but in the winter months the greater portion of the work was entirely neglected, and on the 3rd of January, 1871, the Yestry were compelled to fine Mr. Clilverd £50 for neglect of duty, and then gave orders that horses, carts and men should be employed to more properly cleanse the streets, &c. in the Parish, which order was carried out; and for the four weeks, ending 25th March, 1871, Mr. Clilverd ceased to act, and the Yestry were compelled to perform the whole of the dusting and scavenging, charging the cost thereof to the contractor. The following are the amounts paid for labor and cartage, &c., in consequence of the non-fulfilment of the contract by Mr. Clilverd:— Mr. Henry Dodd—labor and cartage £422 0 0 Mr. Charles T. Parsons ditto 227 0 0 Mr. William Winn ditto 33 12 0 Mr. Henry Crane—cartage 152 0 0 Labor employed by Vestry 72 11 3 Brooms 220 £909 5 3 The amount expended by the Yestry in cleansing and dusting the Parish through the neglect of the contractor, being greater than the amount of the contract for the quarter (£875), nothing was paid to Mr. 31 Clilverd for that quarter, and on the 25th March, 1871, the Vestry, in consequence of the neglect, decided to cancel the contract then existing between itself and Mr. Clilverd. The total cost for dusting and scavenging for the twelve months, including all amounts paid by the Vestry, and deducting the fine with which Mr. Clilverd was inflicted, amounted to £3484 5s. 3d. Maintenance of Roads, Streets, &c. The cost and quantity of materials used in the repair of the macadam and ballast roads during the year, is as follows:— 1222 yards cube broken granite at 12/6 per yard £763 15s.

East Division 984 West Division 1093 A very considerable improvement has been partly carried out, in the widening of Huntingdon Street, which, when completed, the width of the Street will be 40 feet instead of 24 feet as formerly. As regards the general condition of the Parish, I beg to state, that the carriageway paving is in very good order, as the greater portion of 35 it is composed of new work; there are a few places which must before long be repaved, such as— High Street, Shoreditch (from Bateman's Row to the Boundary). Old Street Road (from Kingsland Road to Hoxton Street). Bitfield Street (the whole of). And Hoxton Street (portions of). The footways are mostly in an unsatisfactory and dilapidated condition, and the repairs during the year having been very slight, I fear that unless some of the worst places are repaved, and that very shortly, they will become dangerous. The course I would recommend would bo, to repave those footways in the thoroughfares of larger traffic with new stone, using such of the old material as is fit for places of less traffic. The condition of the sewerage is very satisfactory, the sewers being comparatively free from deposit, and there are but few places without that most necessary of sanitary requirements. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. C. PERRETT, Surveyor.
