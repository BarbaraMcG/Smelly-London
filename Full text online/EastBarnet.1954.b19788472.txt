Chief Sanitary Inspector East Barnet Urban Urban Council EIGHTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1954 BY C. M. SCOTT, M.R.C.S. (Eng.), L.R.C.P. (Lond.) Medical Officer of Health to the Council TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF W. K. PICKUP, M R San. I. Chief Sanitary Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1954. To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present my report for the year 1954. Full details of the work of the Public Health Department can be studied in the ensuing pages of the Report and in particular attention is drawn to the Analysis of Vital Statistics. As mentioned on previous occasions Vital Statistics in a population of the number in East Barnet are apt to be misleading unless due provision is made for the somewhat startling results produced by a small variation in the number of any particular disease or cause of death. This may well be the explanation of what would appear to be the very satisfactory fall in the number of deaths of infants under one year. Nevertheless credit must be given to health propaganda and the work of the Health Visitors A personal opinion on this point is, however, that health propaganda is most satisfactorily pressed by the person actually responsible for the treatment being carried out, e.g. the Medical Practitioner and the District Nurse. Attention must be drawn to the very small number of notifications of Measles received during the year and this leads to the point that there can, unfortunately, be no doubt that notifications 3 of diseases are not being made as statutorily required. Apart from the fact that this invalidates important statistics, some considerable embarrassment is at times caused to the Public Health Department by lack of full information particularly as to the prevalence of infectious diseases. An appeal is made to all on whom the duty of notification devolves to be more meticulous in the carrying out of this duty. Food and Drugs inspections have revealed a high standard of purity generally but also emphasize the necessity of inspections and analyses being performed. The outbreak of food poisoning due to contaminated cheese is worthy of special note. No apology is made for once again referring to the problem of housing to which more detailed attention is likely to be attached next year when the Housing Survey will be completed. Special cases have been brought to the attention of the Committee from time to time and have been sympathetically dealt with within the available resources—which are still pitifully inadequate. Lastly—Rodent Control. This appears to be just about keeping infestation in check but no conviction is felt that any appreciable diminution of the present state of the problem is now being made. In conclusion, my sincere thanks to all members of my staff for their work during a fairly heavy year—and to the Chief Officers and staff of other departments of the Council for their help and co-operation. C. M. SCOTT, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area and Rateable Value Area (in acres) 2,644 Registrar General's estimate of population (1954) 40,730 Number of inhabited houses (rated) 11,908 Number of persons per house 3.4 Rateable value (at 31st December, 1954) £418,283 Product of penny rate Number of business premises £1,690 715 Number of industrial premises 36 Vital Statistics Male Female Total Live births— Legitimate 249 236 485 Illegitimate 8 9 17 Total 257 245 502 Still births— Legitimate 4 3 7 Illegitimate — 2 2 Total 4 5 9 Deaths of infants under 1 year of age- Legitimate 2 3 5 Illegitimate Total 2 3 5 Deaths of infants under 4 weeks of age— Legitimate 1 3 4 Illegitimate Total 1 3 4 Total number of deaths of all ages 187 202 389 5 Births 1953 1954 Live births (rates per 1,000 population 12.9 12.7 Still births (rates per 1,000 population) 0.23 0.23 Still births (rates per 1,000 total; live and still births) 18.5 18.7 Deaths Infants under 1 year of age (rate per 1,000 live births) 10.5 23.1 Total all ages (rate per 1,000 population) 10.1 9.1 The Registrar General's Comparability Factors for Births and Deaths have been taken into account when calculating the above rates.

Totals 17 10 1 2 4 2 — — 8 ANALYSIS OF VITAL STATISTICS 1. The estimated population for 1954 is 40,730 which shows a slight increase of 60 on 1953 figures. The increase brings the population to approximately the same as it was in 1952. 2. The number of live births during the year shows a slight increase on 1953. The birth rate is 12.9 which is 0.2 higher than the previous year again reflecting the increase in the number of births. 3. The infantile mortality rate is 10.5 which is approximately half that of 1953. This figure is apparently very low but on comparing with previous years it is noted that these low figures occur from time to time and probably have no real significance. The death rate for illegitimate infants for the year is zero and whilst last year it was an exceptionally high figure of 111.1 this is again a case in which the very small numbers of illegitimate infants produce false statistics. 4. The death rate for 1954 is 10.1 which is an increase of 1.0 over 1953. The number of deaths was 389 as compared with 351 in the previous year. 5. The number of deaths from Cancer during the year was 76. This is approximately the same as the previous year. The increase in the number of deaths is evenly spread out over the various causes. 6. There were 30 new cases of Tuberculosis during the year as against 43 in 1943. The number of deaths from Tuberculosis were 6 which is a slight decrease on 1953. 7. There were only 508 cases notified of infectious diseases during the year as compared with 1.528 cases in 1953. In 1952 there were 558 cases which is apparently a more normal figure. Of the cases of infectious diseases notified during 1954 414 were either Chicken Pox or Whooping Cough and the prevalence of these diseases is clearly shown in Table 1 as being between 2 and 10 years; over 10 years the incidence of infection becomes rapidly less. The figure of 15 cases of Measles during the year is obviously incorrect but the table only shows the number of cases which have been notified. Obviously by no means can all the cases of measles have been notified. The Sanitary Inspectors visit all cases of Scarlet Fever. Food Poisoning and Dysentery and details of case history are obtained. In the cases of Food Poisoning and Dysentery any samples of food stuffs or specimens which are necessary for the tracing of the outbreak are obtained at the same time as the visit made by the Sanitary Inspector. 9 Water The water which is obtained from deep wells sunk into the chalk is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company. The Company have an up-to-date chemical and bacteriological laboratory in charge of which is a qualified chemist. During the year 1,470 examinations of water representative of supply were made, 99.6 per cent. being B. coli free in 100 ml. Eight samples were also taken by us and submitted for examination to the Public Health laboratory. The reports were in every case satisfactory. 10 East Barnet Urban District Council ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR 1954 To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present my third report to the Council. The total number of visits made during the year show a considerable increase which is mainly due to the additional staff employed on the Housing Survey. This work is proceeding satisfactorily and is well up to the Schedule necessary to allow a report to be made to the Council in time for the return to be made to the Minister. A start has already been made on the housing problem, admittedly in a small way, two areas are under consideration for action and in the following year the report on this matter will undoubtedly be of considerably increased size. The Council became both a Food and Drugs authority and Shops Act authority in June of this year. This has caused considerable increase in the work of the Public Health department. This work has been tackled vigorously by the members of the staff and such additional work has been necessary outside normal hours has been carried out willingly. The Sanitary Inspectors upon whom the burden of the extra work has fallen have shown a keen interest in their additional duties and have made a considerable effort to carry out these new duties efficiently, at the same time maintaining the previous standard in respect of all the other duties. In conclusion I wish to tender my thanks to other officers of the Council and members of the staff for their assistance and co-operation throughout the year. W. K.

This is apparently considerably less than the previous year which was 6.146 but it is mainly due to the re-allocation of certain sub-headings such as Shops Act which are now in a separate main heading, and to additional work being carried out under other categories. Nuisances and Sanitary Defects There have been 4.753 visits made under this heading which is approximately the same as the previous year. These visits are the results of complaints and inspections made relating to those complaints, they also include re-inspections made after the service of notices, etc. The majority of complaints received have dealt with living accommodation and are of such a nature as could be dealt with under the Public Health Acts. It will be seen from Table II that the notices served this year are slightly less than the previous year while the amount of improvements carried out as shown in Table III are approximately the same. Infectious Diseases and Food Poisoning The visits made on infectious diseases have been less this year than last year owing to the decrease in the amount of infectious diseases. 15 The number of visits made to infectious diseases and food poisoning cases is slightly higher per case than previous years. This is mainly due to the increased attention to cases of suspected food poisoning. During September 1954 we received a report from one of the large factories in the district that there had been several cases of apparent food poisoning at the factory on the previous day. On making a visit to the factory it was found that some 35 employees had been or were ill with symptoms of food poisoning. All the persons who had been ill had eaten a meal at the factory canteen and the only common food in each case was cheese. Subsequently samples of cheese as served from the canteen and off the whole cheese were taken and delivered to the Central Public Health Laboratories at Colindale. The reports of the examination of the cheese from the laboratories showed that both of these samples were infected with staphylococci (150 million per gram) and bacillus coliform (present in 0.01 gram) of a faecal origin. On making further enquiries it was found that four whole cheeses had been purchased by the company and that this was the first of these cheeses to be used. All the remaining cheese and the other three whole cheeses were taken to the laboratory where samples were taken from them. The results of the analysis of these samples showed that the used cheese and two of the other three cheeses were heavily contaminated with staphylococci and bacillus coliform. The remaining cheese being free from contamination. The reports from the pathologist made it clear that the cheese had been contaminated during the course of manufacture and not through handling or storing. The history of these cheeses was explored and the importers were contacted and subsequently a visit was received from the Agent concerned. The matter was taken up by the Ministry of Food and the Agent of the country of origin. In all probability the cause of this contamination was due to a defective "starter" during the course of manufacture and was not likely to recur in normal conditions. HOUSING During the year to which this report refers six demolition orders under Section 11 of the Housing Act. 1936, were served and one closing order under Section 10 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1954. The demolition orders were served on:— 42 and 44, Cat Hill, East Barnet. 17 and 19, Henry Road. New Barnet. 2 and 4, Hadley Road, New Barnet. The closing order was served on:— 9, Warwick Cottages. At the beginning of the year there were seven demolition orders outstanding; one closing order and one case in which an 16 taking had been given under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936. In the case of the outstanding demolition orders on:— 54, Edward Road, New Barnet. 14, Warwick Cottages, New Barnet. 107, Leicester Road, New Barnet. no further action has been taken. 113, 115, 117 and 119, Lancaster Road, New Barnet in which demolition orders were served on the 5th October, 1953, are in the process of being vacated and upon completion, action will be taken to ensure their demolition. The outstanding closing order on 8, Lyonsdown Road is still in force and the premises are still vacant. The undertaking on 10, Warwick Cottages, New Barnet, which was given on the 10th December, 1953. with six months in which to complete, has now been carried out and all the work as laid down by the Council's specification satisfactorily completed. 42 and 44, CAT HILL, EAST BARNET. These premises consist of a pair of semi-detached cottages of considerable age. They are damp and dilapidated and are also of very poor arrangement. As they were not repairable at a reasonable expense the matter was reported to the Council and following the usual procedure a demolition order was served upon them on the 15th February, 1954. Since that date both premises have been vacated although they have not yet been demolished. 17 and 19, HENRY ROAD. NEW BARNET. Consisted of one building which was turned into two separate flats and was affected by dilapidations and considerable fractures and subsidence of the flank walls. The flank wall was also leaning outwards to such an extent that the main roof fillets had fractured and in spite of constant repair allowed the rain to enter the premises. The matter was reported to the Council and a demolition order was served on the 21st June, 1954, and the houses were vacated and had been demolished by the 10th October. 1954. 2 and 4, HADLEY ROAD, NEW BARNET These premises consisted of a pair of old cottages in which the main defect was severe fractures of the brickwork and considerable subsidence and movement of the walls. Their condition was such that they were completely unrepairable and in consequence were reported to the Council, who after consideration, served a demolition order on both premises on the 21st June, 1954. These premises have now been vacated but they have not yet been demolished. 9, WARWICK COTTAGES, NEW BARNET This is one of a terrace of fourteen cottages and was in a very bad state of dilapidation and showed excessive damp. Owing to 17 its situation advantage was taken of Section 10 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1954, and a closing order was served on the premises. It had not been vacated by the end of the year to which the report refers. General During the year 2,218 visits have been made under this heading which is very considerably higher than those made during the previous year. This is, of course, due to the Housing Survey which is at present in the course of being carried out. Under the Housing (Rent and Repairs) Act, 1954, a full report will be submitted to the Council in 1955 with the necessary information to enable the Council to consider the completion of the form required by that Act for submission to the Minister. FOOD HYGIENE Routine inspection of various food premises has continued throughout the year and 2,115 visits have been made, which is approximately the same as last year. The standard of cleanliness throughout the district has continued to be high and although the number of notices served for cleanliness and other defects has been low. these visits undoubtedly help to maintain this high standard and also maintain, which in my opinion is highly essential, the personal contact between this department and the proprietors and managers of the premises handling food. A friendly co-operation has been maintained in all cases. A copy of the report of each sample was supplied to the retailer or dairy proprietor. In the last 5 years no sample of milk has been found unsatisfactory. The continued satisfactory reports of the milk sampling are evidence that the care with which milk is handled is being maintained. All samples are obtained from roundsmen who have no previous knowledge that samples will be taken from them and in consequence the milk sampled is the same as that supplied to the public. Milk Supply The following licences were granted to dealers to sell under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1936-1949:— Tuberculin Tested 5 Pasteurised 10 Sterilised 11 The following Supplementary licences under principal licences granted by other authorities to sell milk from premises outside this area were also granted:— Tuberculin Tested 13 Pasteurised 13 Sterilised 10 Ninety-seven samples of milk were purchased and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Ministry of Health's Emergency 18 Public Health Laboratory, at Hertford:— Test applied:— No. of Samples Submitted (a) Methylene blue.

These premises being satisfactory all four applications were granted. 103 Samples were obtained and submitted for bacteriological examination, with the following results: — Provisional grade 1 81 „ 2 8 „ 3 4 „ 4 10 103 During the year as may be seen from the above table there were ten grade 4 samples and four grade 3. Of the grade 4 samples eight were from one wholesaler and two were from one other. Of the grade 3 samples 3 were from the wholesaler who had two grade 4's and one from one of the large manufacturers. In the case of the large manufacturer no further unsatisfactory samples were received, and consequently the cause of low grading is not known but was probably due to accidental contamination either during transit or in the retailing premises. In the case of the other two manufacturers considerable correspondence took place between this department and the manufacturers also the Public Health Departments of the areas in which they were situated. The matter was closed as far as we were concerned by the retailers changing their source of ice cream supply and obtaining their new supplies from one of the large manufactures. At the present moment there are no retailers in this district selling ice cream manufactured by the wholesaler who had eight grade 4 samples. The only person registered in this district to manufacture ice cream has not during the year produced any ice cream. This manufacturer produces ice cream only very occasionally and then only in small quantities. All the other retailers purchase their supplies from large manufacturers. 19 Samples were taken during the year of iced lollies which were found to be quite satisfactory from bacteriological standards. As far as is known only one person makes iced lollies on their premises which have been carefully inspected. A high standard is maintained and great care is paid to the cleanliness of the equipment. In addition to the visits made for the purpose of sampling, regular inspections are made of all ice-cream retailers, especially during the summer months. Refrigerators and serving utensils where loose ice cream is sold are carefully inspected for cleanliness. Meat and Other Food Inspections The requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, have been carried out as regards all premises on which meat is sold for human consumption. The inspection of food (other than meat) is carried out as necessary. As may be seen from the Table of foods during the year, a total amount of 15 cwts. of food of various types was condemned as unfit for human consumption. Co-operation between this office and the retailers of food continues to be extremely good and no difficulties have been experienced in this connection. FACTORIES During the year 370 visits have been made to, factories and outworkers in the district for the purpose of the Factories Acts, 1937. It was found necessary to serve only one Notice in connection with these premises, which has been complied with. The general condition of the factories as far as the Section which the local authority are responsible for under the Factories Act is reasonable and, as may be seen from the small number of Notices which have been served, the number of contraventions which are found is extremely low. INFESTATIONS Rodent Control During the year 300 complaints of rats and mice have been received. All of these premises were visited and in addition premises on which the infestations may have arose or which may have been affected were also visited, in consequence some 636 properties received visits during the year and it was found that 338 of these were infested with rats or mice. All the infestations were dealt with by the Rodent Operator. The number of complaints received are approximately the same as last year and in general the infestations treated have been of a minor character. Certain infestations recur from year to year but in each case there is some contributing factor which is outside our control. 20 In a few cases difficulty has been experienced and during the year it became necessary to serve a Notice under The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, to rat proof a chicken run. Very few of these notices are served as in most cases it is possible due to the co-operation of owners to carry out the necessary works. During the year a single sewer treatment was carried out in June. 1954. being the annual 10% Test of Sewer Manholes followed by the treatment based on the results. 168 Manholes were baited with damp sausage rusk and on an inspection made two days later in 19 cases the bait was completely taken and in one case partially taken. In the treatment which followed this test 49 manholes were pre-baited consisting of those in which the bait was partially or completely taken and those in the immediate vicinity. In 23 of these manholes was the pre-bait taken and on those being poison baited there were 22 "takes." There were no complete takes of poison. The sewers in the district are not heavily infested but the amount of infestation seems to remain constant from year to year. Insect Control The number of complaints that are being received regarding infestations by various types of insects, not necessarily fleas and bugs, is increasing. In these cases assistance and advice are given and where necessary insecticides are supplied free of charge. The number of verminous premises which have been treated during the year is extremely low, and the existence of fleas and bugs in houses in this area is now rare. FOOD AND DRUGS In June of the year the Council became the Food and Drugs Authority and as may be seen from the tables 52 samples were taken and forwarded to the Public Analyst and a further 28 were examined in the Public Health Department. Of these samples 6 examined by the Public Analyst were found to be adulterated and one of those examined by the Public Health Department. The six samples examined by the Public Analyst which were found to be unsatisfactory were:— Cheese and Macaroni Orange Juice Vinegar Ham Cheese Spread Whisky Hot Milk. Cheese and Macaroni This unsatisfactory sample was described as "Cheese and Macaroni" and was found to consist of two portions—one of macaroni and the other of cheese powder. The portion of macaroni was five times greater by weight than that of cheese powder. This was a contravention of the Labelling of Food Order which requires 21 that the ingredient in the greatest proportion should be specified first whereas in this case the macaroni was in a far greater proportion. The description of the preparation was, therefore, misleading. On receiving the Analyst's report the manufacturers of the preparation were communicated with and they replied to the effect that they had reprinted the packets in which the preparation was retailed in such a manner as would comply with the Labelling of Food Order. The contravention was reported to the Committee together with the letters which had been received from the manufacturers and the Committee decided that as the matter was being remedied no further action should be taken. Orange Juice This was a sample consisting of diluted and sweetened orange juice in accordance with the requirements of the Food Standards, Soft Drinks, Order for Citrus Fruit Drink to be consumed without dilution. The Analyst was of the opinion on the information which he had at the moment of receiving the sample that the description " orange juice " means the natural juice free from dilution. On discussing the matter further with him and forwarding samples of the cap which covered the bottle it was decided that the description on the cap was worded as to bring the contents within the meaning of the Soft Drinks Order. Consequently no further action was taken. Vinegar A sample of vinegar was forwarded to the Analyst who reported that it was not in fact vinegar but consisted of a solution of acetic acid coloured with caramel and, therefore, had the composition of a non-brewed condiment. Vinegar is a liquid which is obtained by a process of fermentation and the sample was a product not so obtained. In addition fhe sample contained only 3.70% of acetic acid and the minimum quantity of acetic acid allowable is 4%. This was reported to the Committee who after consideration decided that a warning letter should be sent. Hot Milk A sample of Hot Milk purchased in a cafe was sent for analysis and was found to contain 20% of added water. This high proportion of added water being confirmed by the freezing point of the sample. A report on the sample was made to the Committee who sent a warning letter. Ham Cheese Spread This sample was unsatisfactory in regard to the labelling as on examination it was found to consist of approximately 5% of finely chopped ham. Under the Labelling of Food Order, as previously mentioned, the ingredient in the greatest proportion by weight should be 22 specified first in the description whereas in this sample the ingredient by far in the smallest proportion was named first. The Analyst considered that the label was consequently misleading. The matter was taken up with the manufacturers and they replied that they had already dealt with the matter and that in future the preparation would be called " Cheese Spread with Ham," which complies with the Labelling of Food Order. This was reported to the Committee who decided that no further action should be taken in this matter. Whisky Several samples of spirits were taken during the period in which this Authority was the Food and Drugs Authority and one sample of Whisky was found to contain 64.5% of proof spirit which is below the legal standard which is 65%. The deficiency represented a little under 1% of water being added to the whisky of minimum legal strength. On reporting the matter to the Committee they decided that as the contravention was so slight a warning letter be sent. One sample of the number which were examined by the Public Health Department was found to be unsatisfactory, this being a sample of Ham Cheese Spread in which the ham was in a far less proportion by weight than the cheese. A letter was written to the manufacturers and they informed us that the description of the product to be applied when reprinting labels would be "Cheese Spread with Ham" which complies with the Labelling of Food Order. During the six months in which the Council has been a Food and Drugs Authority considerable work has been carried out in this connection and much experience has been gained. No Food and Drugs Authority can take but a very small proportion of samples compared with the total amount of food consumed. Consequently it is of great importance that the samples to be taken should be selected with great care and many factors must be taken into consideration. It is obvious that the pre-packed foods are as a whole less liable to adulteration than loose foods but a small proportion of samples of such foods must be taken. An endeavour is made not to sample foods which it is known other authorities have already found to be satisfactory. A constant watch is kept for new types of foods, packings and manufacturers and if there is suspicion that the article is not properly described or not of the substance or quality demanded, samples are taken. As this is the first report to this Council on Food and Drugs and is for a comparatively short period of six months, I feel that considerable progress has been made and every endeavour will in the future be made to set a high standard and to maintain such standard. 23 SHOPS ACTS The Council became the authority under the above Acts in June, 1954. A general survey was made of the shops in the area and attention was paid to the closing hours and early closing days of various premises. These visits necessitated considerable work outside normal hours. Several variations in closing days and Sunday openings were noticed and some of them have been dealt with. In addition several warnings have been given to various shop keepers for selling goods after closing hours. When the duties of the Shops Acts were taken over from the County copies of the Early Day Closing Orders were obtained and it was noted that the district had been divided into two areas for the purpose of early closing days, being Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. The orders were made under the Shops Act, 1912, on the 11th November, 1912. One order is cited as: "Order of the Hertfordshire County Council under Section 4 (2) of "The Shops Act, 1912." fixing the day of the Weekly Half-Holiday for non-exempted shops within the East Barnet and New Barnet Polling Districts of the East Barnet County Council Electoral Division within the East Barnet Valley Urban District; and the Barnet Vale County Council Electoral Division within the East Barnet Valley Urban District." and the other as : " Order of the Hertfordshire County Council under Section 4 of" The Shops Act, 1912," fixing the day of the Weekly HalfHoliday for non-exempted shops within the Brunswick Park Polling District of the East Barnet County Council Electoral Division within the East Barnet Valley Urban District." On making enquiries into the Brunswick Park Polling district it was found that it extended over a much larger area than is at present closing on the early closing day stated by that order. This anomaly has existed for a considerable number of years and there are consequently many cases in which there is a contravention of these closing orders. The reason that this variation arose was the extensive building in the '30's in the Hampden Square area which previously had been open country. These areas took the closing day of New Barnet while they should have in fact taken the Brunswick Park closing day. Consequently it is impracticable to enforce the early closing day as a large number of premises are already closing on the wrong day. There are in the orders exceptions to early closing days which vary with each district. This further confuses matters in this regard consequently it is proposed during the following year to place a full report before the Council dealing with this matter with a view to getting the position regularised. 24
