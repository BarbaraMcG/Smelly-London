Total Number of New Buildings. 55 202 5 13 5 225 A pipe sewer 15 inches and 12 inches in diameter has been laid and completed in Abheyfield Road, and the cost thereof apportioned for payment amongst the owners of property in the said street. 15 inch pipe sewers have also been laid in the following new streets, viz.—Tissington Street and Warndon Street, the cost of which will be borne by the owners of property in the said streets. The Metropolitan Board of Works having, upon an appeal of Messrs. Smith and Gale, decided that the drainage of a new street, called Carline Crescent, should be taken into the sewer in Jamaica Level belonging to the Vestry of Bermondsey, a 12 inch pipe sewer has been laid accordingly in Carline Crescent and Clarehall Place, and connected with the before-mentioned sewer in Jamaica Level. The owners having prcviouslv paid to this Vestry the estimated amount of the cost thereof. 10G feet of 12 inch pipe sewer has been laid in Church Street, opposite the "Europa," in lieu of an old brick sewer which had been damaged by a gas main belonging to the Surrey Consumers' Gas Company having been laid through the same; the cost of reinstating the said sewer has been charged to the Gas Company. 204 feet of 12 in. pipe drain has been laid in Derrick Street and Elgar Street, for the drainage of the Licensed Victuallers' Dock, and the cost thereof paid by the owners of the Dock premises. The Medical Officer of Health having in October, 1875, reported to the Vestrv upon the offensive state of the open portion of the Karl Sewer at the southern boundarv of this parish, the Vestry caused a communication to be sent to the Metropolitan Board of Works on the subject, to which a reply was received to the effect that with the view of abating the nuisance complained of, the Board had given instructions for a length of about 200 feet of 15 inch pipe to be laid down forthwith, for the purpose of intercepting the house drainage passing into such open sewer, as it was found that the principal cause of the nuisance proceeded from offensive drainage from Mr. Beardsell's Size and Engine Oil Works being discharged into the sewer through an open channel under the control of this Vestry. A notice was served upon Mr. Beardsell requiring him to discontinue draining his premises into such open channel, and he has since laid a 12 inch pipe drain from his works to the sewer in the llotherhithc New Road; the drainage into the open channel has been cut off and the channel filled up. 15 Mr. F. C. Smith was summoned by the direction of the Vestry, for having, without their consent, erected a building over a portoin of the sewer, Forsyth Street, running through his premises there. The Magistrate visited the premises and afterwards dismissed the summons, on the ground that it had not been proved to his satisfaction, that the defendant had knowingly built over the sewer. The Vestry having called the attention of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to complaints made of the nuisance arising from the effluvia emitted from the ventilating shafts in the main sewers in this parish, a reply to the Vestry's letter on the subject was received from the Engineer to the Hoard in November, 1875, to the effect, that the Hoard could not close or otherwise dispense with the ventilators referred to without endangering the safety of the men working in the sewers, and, perhaps, even the stability of the latter in the event of an explosion; but that care is and will at all times be taken to keep the sewers clean and free from offensive deposit, and thus, as far as possible, prevent any nuisance emanating from them; also, stating the subject of improving the present system of ventilating the sewers, is receiving the attention of the committee specially appointed by the Board for the purpose. Paving Works. The following materials have been used in repairing the roads during the year ended 25th March, 1876, viz.: — Broken Guernsey Granite 364 cubic yards • • Ditto Bombay Stone 60 „ Ditto Common Stone 24 „ Gravel and Hoggin 122 „ Slop and Snow carted 9486 loads Water for watering roads 12500 „ The carriageway and footwa\s of Tissington Street have been made up and paved under contract with Mr. Edward Davidson, for the sum of £199. which has been apportioned for payment amongst the owners of the property in and abutting upon such street. The Vestry resolved to pare the carriageway at Broadway, Paradise Street, also the carriageway Church Street, from Paradise Street to the entrance to Elephant Lane, and with the consent of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the sum of £2,200 was borrowed of the Atlas Assurance Company to defray the cost of the work, upon mortgage of the Paving and General Purposes Hates of the Parish, such sum to be repaid by 20 equal annual instalments of £110, with interest at the rate of £4, 5s. 0d. per cent. per annum.

Charity Estates, &c. The accounts of Messrs. William Archer and Robert Foottit, Churchwardens, for the year 1875-76. have been audited, and the following is a copy of the Charities Account:— £ s. d.

Miscellaneous. Under orders made by the Metropolitan Board of Works, the following Roads and Streets in the Parish have been renumbered, viz.:—I)eptford Lower-road, Jamaica Level and Glebe-road; and the following Streets renamed, viz.:— Cross-street, Swan Lane, to be “Seth-street." Cross-street, King-street, to be “ Honey-street." Cross-street, Dept ford-road, to be “Cope-street." John'-pi ace, to be “Nolan-place." Welliagton-street, Albion-street, to be “Hadland-street." Hanover-street, to be “Neston-street." Ann s-place, Albion-street, to be “Gooch-place" The water of the River Thames having on the 15th November, 1875, overflowed banks in several places in this parish, the Vestry at a Special Meeting held on the 19th November, 1875. to consider the matter, passed the following resolution and forwarded a copy thereof to the Metropolitan Hoard of Works:— Ursolrrd.—That this Vestry having seen with deep regret the effects of the recent overflow of the Thames, occasioning as it has a great amount of suffering amongst the poor in this parish and a large destruction of property, and it appearing from the opinion of the Solicitor to the Metropolitan Board, given to the St. Saviour's District Board of By Cash paid for Bread:— £ s. d. £ a. d.

A letter from the Clerk to the Metropolitan Board of Works was subsequently received, acknowledging receipt of the foregoing resolution, and stating it had been laid before the Board and referred to a Committee, but the Vestry heard nothing further from the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Vestry, however, caused notices to be given to the owners and occupiers of River-side property, requiring them forthwith to raise their River walls, wharves and premises, in order to prevent a recurrence of innundation in the event of another high tide. In January, 1876, the Vestry appointed Messrs. Thomas William Clarke and Francis John Bisley as delegates, to represent it at a conference of delegates of the saveral Vestries and District Boards affected, by a proposal of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to apply to Parliament to enable that Board to compel Vestries and District Boards to construct such works, for the prevention of Floods from the Thames, as may appear to the Metropolitan Board necessary, and in case of default, to execute and make themselves and charge the Vestries and District Boards with the cost thereof. The Delegates have had several meetings at the office of St. Saviour's District Board of Works, Southwark, and the subject is still under consideration. The Vestry having had under consideration the increase in the expenditure of the School Board for London, in April, 1S75, the following resolution was passed and copies thereof were forwarded to the School Board for London, and the Rcvarends R. Marshall Martin and J. Sinclair, and Messrs. Alfred Lafone and Jas. Wallace, the Members representing the Southwark Division, viz.:— Resolved. "That a letter be written to the School Board for London and the members representing the Southwark Division, to the effect, ' That while this Vestry quite agree with the provisions of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, being efficiently carried out, they desired the Board would use economy and keep the expenditure strictly within the limits of the said Act.'" The following replies were received by the Vestry:— 21 School Board for London, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 22nd April, 1875. Dear Sirs, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th inst., which be laid before the Board at their meeting next week. I am, Dear Sirs, Your obedient Servant, Messrs. Hawks & Stokes, (Signed) G. II. CROAD, Vestry Offices, 82 Paradise-street, S.E. Clerk to the Board. Denmark Mill, S.E., 23rd April, 187"). Dear Sirs, I am favoured by yours of the 21st, informing me of the purport of a discussion by your Vestry on the subject of the School Board expenditure, and beg vou will tender the members my best thanks for the moderate and practical tone of their resolution. I speak in the name of all my colleagues, when I say, we are most anxious on the subject of expenditure, and will never cease our efforts to control it within reasonable limits, at the same time securing thorough efficiency. We have had uphill work and need all the support we can get from the ratepayers as a body, but we can point with just pride to the Schools that have been built and filled in our division, and the efficient teaching carried on within their walls, and if the members of the Vestry would only visit some of them, I am sure they would be satisfied. I am, Dear Sirs, Yours faithfully, Messer. Hawks & Stokes, (Signed) ALFRED LAFONE. Vestn of St. Marv, Rotherhithe. • • * 160, Long Lane, S.E., 23rd April, 1875. Dear Sirs, 1 beg to acknowledge your letter of the 21st from the Vestry of St. Mary, Rotherhithe, upou the subject of the expenditure of the London School Board, and I assure the Vestry that 1 am entirely with them in using my utmost endeavours to prevent any undue and unnecessary expense in carrying out the work of the Board. I am, Dear Sirs, Yours faithfullv, Messrs. Hawks & Stokes, (Signed) J. WALLACE. Vestrv Clerks, 82 Paradise-street, S.E. 9 The Vestry also appointed Messrs. Robert Allen and Thomas William Clarke as delegates, to attend a conference of representatives from the various Metropolitan Authorities, upon the subject of the policy and increased expenditure of the School Board for London. 22 The Delegates attended several meetings at the office of the Board of Works for the Westminster District, with reference thereto, and ultimately the conference of delegates drew up some observations upon the subject and submitted the same to the Duke of Richmond and Lord Sandon. In April, 1875, the Vestry appointed Messrs. Henry Hayward, William Durrant and Robert Allen to represent the Vestry on a committee of delegates from the several Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis, to watch the legislation affecting Local Self-Government, with the view of preventing any interference therewith ; and several meetings relating thereto were attended by the delegates, at the Vestry-hall, St. Luke's, Middlesex. Metropolitan Member. At a Joint Meeting of the Vestries of St. John, St. Thomas and St. Olavc, Southwark, and the Vestry of this Parish, held on the 18th November, 1875, at St. Olave's Vestry Hall, John Tolhurst, Esq. was duly elected a Member of the Metropolitan Board of Works, in the place of Thomas Turner, Esq. resigned. The Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. Under the provisions of this Act, a new valuation of the properties in this Parish was made in the year 1875, whereby the Assessment of the Parish was increased as follows:— Gross Value. Rateable Value. From £199,061 10s. 0d. £155,288 0s. 0d. TO £214,077 0s. 0d. £172,963 0s. 0d. APPENDIX No. 1. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health. From the 1st April, 1875, to 31st March, 1876. The Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen, The course of legislation, in perfecting our sanitary laws, has made some progress by adding to the number "The Artizans' Dwellings Act, an Act of Parliament which, in some districts of the Metropolis, seems well adapted to assist the efforts we are making to improve the habitations of the poor. Hitherto it has not been considered advisable to employ its operation in this Parish, nevertheless, in this department of sanitary labour a considerable amount of work has been done; many houses apparently unfit for human habitation have been repaired and cleansed and thereby converted into suitable dwellings, and the old and decayed houses in Hanover Street, which had long been considered unfit for human beings to dwell in and occasioned many a strife between the Vestry and the lessee, have at length been demolished and several convenient houses erected on the old site. Diseases of the Zymotic class invariably contribnte largely to the total number of deaths, and nearly all the fatal cases occur under five years of age; the annual average number during the last ten years is about one hundred and ten, but one hundred and forty-three deaths have been occasioned by some of the most important diseases of this class during the year ending March 31st, 1876. In the present state of our knowledge, it is not possible to determine the cause of the fluctuations we observe in the occurrence and varying intensity of epidemic diseases, and on this occasion I can only account for the increase in the number of deaths from these causes, partly to the increasing population of the Parish, but chiefly to the unusual prevalence of Scarlatina, which destroyed the live of fifty-eight children. 24 It may be ascertained by looking over the table referring to epidemic diseases, that during the last ten years Scarlatina has been more destructive to infantile life than any other disease of its class; it is also very difficult to arrest the progress of this and kindred diseases, even in the houses of those who can obtain the aid of every known preventive measure, but when they assail the homes of the poor, the present power we possess of checking the extension and diminishing the fatality of these diseases is very limited; in these circumstances the want of space renders isolation impracticable, usually the healthy children of the family and the infected patients live in the same room, and the intercourse of the parents and children with other persons living near them is so free as to quickly desseminate the poison, and in this manner the particular epidemic disease is likely to spread rapidly, and for want of better accommodation and more judicious management, the effects of the disease are more fatal. It frequently happens that the Medical Officer of Health has no information of the existence of epidemic disease until death reveals it, and this want of knowledge is considered a great hinderance to him in the fulfilment of his duties. It seems desirable that some power should be created to render isolation of the patients more effectual, and also to require some person to give immediate information to the sanitorv authorities whenever a case of epidemic disease occurs. This is rather a difficult subject to deal with, but it is hoped that some arrangement may be made to accomplish the object without asking for the assistance of the legislature to enforce it. As epidemic diseases are always more or less prevalent, it is obvious that we should be at all times well prepared to cope with them, and I would beg to remind you that in some former severe and fatal visitations of this class of diseases, we had the help of a disinfecting chamber, which was taken down when the Vestry was deprived of the use of the Stone-yard contiguous to the Workhouse. I believe it was a useful instrument and calculated to stem the progress of disease and assist in preserving human life, and I would earnestly advise the Vestry to take into consideration the necessity of having it at once reconstructed in a convenient place. Zymotic Diseases.—I have enumerated below and made a few remarks on some of the most important of this kind of disease. A table is also added which extends over the last ten years, and explains the relative number of deaths that have annually taken place during that period. Fever.—Four cases were registered, three typhoid and one typhus. Annual average during ten years, ten deaths. Small Pox.—No death has been recorded, and it is worthy of attention, that only one has occurred during the last three vears. Annual average for ten vears, nine deaths. Scarlatina.—The unusual prevalence of this disease has caused forty-eight deaths. Annual average for ten years, 26 50 deaths. In the first quarter, seven cases were registered ; in the second, eighteen ; in the third, twenty-nine, and in the fourth, four. easles.—By this disease fourteen lives were destroyed. Annual average for ten years, eleven deaths. 25 Whooping Cough.—This disease was fatal in thirty-three eases. Annual average for ten years, twenty-one deaths. Diarrhœa.—The number of deaths are below the average and amounted to twentyfour—twenty-three having occurred under two years of age. Diptheria.—A considerable diminuation in the number of deaths from this cause is observable, ten having been registered compared with twenty-six in the former year. Table of deaths occasioned by some of the most important Zymotic diseases during the last ten years.

But this slight check to increase of population need not occasion surprise, hut should rather be considered a degree of compensation for the large increase of 1875 over 1874, which amounted to one hundred and forty, or about an eighth of the whole number. Deaths.—Six hundred and seventy two deaths were registered during the year, and as seven hundred and five were recorded in the previous year, the number in reduced by thirty-three; and by comparing the 1192 births with the 672 deaths, the excess of births over deaths amounts to 520. Births registered during the year in quarterly divisions:— Males. Females. Total. From April 1, 1875, to June 30, 1875 128 123 151 „ July 1, 1875, to September 30, 1875 142 170 312 „ October 1, 1875, to December 31, 1875 173 130 302 „ January 1, 1876, to March 31, 1876 185 142 327 627 565 1192 26 Although the deaths registered amount to six hundred and seventy-two, we must subtract twenty-seven from that number, which will reduce it to six hundred and forty- five; this deduction is accounted for by twenty-two coroner's inquests having been held on the bodies of persons who had not resided in the parish, and the death of five patients in the Infirmary attached to the Union, who had been sent from the parish of Bermondsey. In the Infirmary nineteen deaths occurred in the year, fourteen of parishioners of Rotherhithe and five of Bermondsey. Deaths registered during the vear in quarterlv divisions: — Males. Females.

The Birth-rate reaches nearly forty per thousand, and the rate of mortality rather over twenty-one per thousand. In order that you may compare the number of deaths according to age, I have stated in three columns, which includes the returns for the last three years, the relative number of deaths according to age:— 1874 1875. 1876 Under 2 years of age 229 263 272 Between 2 and 5 years of age 33 57 78 „ 5 and 10 „ 15 25 32 „ 10 and 20 „ 19 32 27 „ 20 and 30 „ 31 42 35 „ 30 and 40 „ 40 50 44 „ 40 and 50 „ 54 60 50 „ 50 and 60 „ 49 60 39 „ 60 and 70 „ 48 55 46 „ 70 and 80 „ 47 39 36 „ 80 and 90 „ 14 22 12 „ 90 and 100 „ 0 0 1 101 „ 1 1 0 0 580 705 672 27 Two hundred and twenty-five notices were served during the year, to abate various forms of nuisances. The nuisances complained of chiefly consisted of defective drainage, dirty and dilapidated houses, and the annoyancc caused by the manufacture of artificial manure in railway arches; the latter kind of nuisance occasioned much trouble and would be difficult to suppress, if the Railway Company did not co-operate in the matter; this has been done to a great extent, and I trust, in my next annual report, to be able to inform you that this offensive manufacture has ceased in this parish. Thirty-two summonses were issued, which is the greatest number this Vestry ever required to enforce its notices since I have been officially connected with it. This resistance to the law is not creditable to those who break it, and entails much trouble on those engaged in upholding it; the result in every case, however, was so far satisfactory, that the magistrate decided in favour of the sanitary authorities. The Slaughter-houses were inspected from time to time and no fault could bo found with their condition. The applications for licenses were not in any case recommended to be opposed. The Cow-houses were examined at the same period as the Slaughter-houses, and it was not considered advisable to offer opposition to the applications for licenses An improvement is observable in the condition of the Cowhouse, which I expect to be further advanced when I present my next annual statement. The condition of the Bake-houses, when they were inspected, was on the whole satisfactory. Yours respectfully, SAMUEL TILLEY. Rotherhithe, 1876. 28 TABLE OF THE MORTALITY IN ROTHERHITHE.
