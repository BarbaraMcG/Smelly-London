There were no changes of staff during the year. Population. The Registrar General's estimate of the population in 1959 was 42,330 which is the same as his estimate for the previous year. Births. During the year 552 births were recorded (280 males and 272 females) compared with 591 in 1958. There were 24 premature live births and of these, 22 survived. The two infants who failed to survive weighed less than 4lbs. 6ozs. at birth and so would be extremely difficult to rear. Of the 10 infant deaths under the age of 1 year, 2 were due to prematurity. Deaths. The total number of deaths occurring amongst residents was 601 (291 males and 310 females) compared with 589 in 1958. The death rate, when corrected to allow for the high proportion of elderly residents is 9.7 per thousand population which compares favourably with other towns in the country. 6 SECTION B.— GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA. These are mainly provided by the Surrey County Council, the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, and the Executive Council for the County. In order to make the report complete these are briefly described below. (a) Services Provided by the Surrey County Council. These are organized on a Divisional basis, the Northern Division comprising the Boroughs of Richmond and Barnes. The Medical Officer of Health for Richmond is also the Divisional Medical Officer and this arrangement assists co-ordination of the personal health services and environmental health. Administrative, Infant Welfare, and School Medical functions are carried out from the following Centres:— Divisional Health Offices and Welfare Centre, Kings Road, Richmond. Welfare Centre, Windham Road, Richmond. Welfare Centre, Back Lane, Ham. Health Visitors are employed and, according to the District in which they work they are based on one or other of the above centres. District Nurses and Midwives are provided and they work under the direct supervision of the general practitioners. Moral Welfare or the care of unmarried mothers and illegitimate children is undertaken by an officer based at the Divisional Health Office. A Home Help Service provides for domestic help in the home in cases of home confinement or illness. The service is under the management of the Home Help Supervisor who is based at the Divisional Health Office. An Ambulance Service is provided from the station in Kings Road, Richmond which operates under the control station in Maiden The service is supported by the ambulance of the local division of the St. John Ambulance Brigade. A Day Nursery for the care of children up to the age of five years is located in Parkshot, Richmond. 7 (b) Services Provided by the Regional Hospital Board. Hospitals. The Royal Hospital and Kingston Hospital provide general treatment both for in-patients and out-patients. In addition, hospitals in London and Middlesex are frequently used by Richmond residents. Patients suffering from infectious diseases are admitted to the South Middlesex Hospital, Mogden Lane, except in the few instances when no beds are available. In these cases, patients are admitted to Tol worth Isolation Hospital or to a hospital in the London area. Psychiatric Services. The Medical Staff of Banstead Hospital hold Out-patient Clinics on Tuesday and Friday afternoons at the Royal Hospital for patients living in Richmond and Barnes. Laboratory Facilities. The laboratory of the Royal Hospital is available for the examination of specimens sent in by general practitioners. The Ministry of Health, Public Health Laboratory, Epsom, is available for the examination of samples of milk, ice-cream, and water and of any pathological specimens. In addition, the staff is always available to assist the Medical Officer of Health in field investigations in the case of epidemics or outbreaks of food poisoning. The Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, N.W.9, is available for advice, special immunising agents and special investigations. The Counties Public Health Laboratories, Victoria Street, S.W.1 are used for the examination of water samples and for advice in the control of purity of the water supply. Mortuary. This is provided and maintained by Richmond Borough Council on a site close to the Petty Sessions Court. It is well equipped with two post-mortem examination tables. All such examinations required within the boroughs of Richmond and Barnes are carried out here and Barnes Borough Council make an annual payment for this service. 8 Nursing Homes. The following private Nursing Home is registered by the Surrey County Council:— Tyneham House Nursing Home, 108, Church Road. (c) Services Provided by the Surrey Executive Council. Under Part IV of the National Health Service Act 1946, the Surrey Executive Council has the responsibility of providing General Medical and Dental Services, Pharmaceutical Services, and Supplementary Ophthalmic Services. More than Twenty doctors living within the Borough have undertaken to provide General Medical Services. Many of these have also undertaken to provide Maternity Medical Services. A list of doctors taking part is available at the Main Post Office, Public Library and Public Health Department. The offices of the Council are situated at 187, Ewell Road, Surbiton (d) Services provided by Richmond Borough Council. These are dealt with generally in the body of this report. The undermentioned service is used in close association with the domiciliary services provided by other authorities, and so it is mentioned under this section. Laundry Service for Incontinent Patients. During 1959, twenty-nine new patients availed themselves of the service. Of these, 13 have since died, 6 have been removed to hospital, and 7 discontinued the service. At the end of the year, three cases only were continuing the service. During the year, 1,138 sheets were washed. Care of the Aged and the Chronic Sick. The local scheme for the care of the aged and the chronic sick is largely unchanged. The general Health Visitors continue to supervise those who are frail or in need of assistance while the geriatric Health Visitor supervises those who are on the Waiting List for admission to hospital. Other than in times of epidemic the waiting period for admission to a hospital or a home is not unduly long, and a desperate case is 9 invariably admitted without delay. In quieter times, Dr. Finn is able to admit elderly chronic sick patients to hospital for periods of two or three weeks in order to give exhausted relatives a short rest. At the same time the patient is carefully assessed and is given any form of treatment thought to be beneficial. The Home Helps and District Nurses continue to play an important part in the case of elderly patients in their homes and the voluntary services do most valuable work by such services as "Meals on Wheels'", Old Peoples’ Clubs, etc. A laundry service for incontinent patients is provided which considerably reduces the burden on relatives and makes it possible for them to nurse at home a patient who would otherwise have to be admitted to hospital. The service is confined exclusively to incontinent patients and articles laundered are limited to sheets and draw sheets. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 — SECTION 47. In many cases old people create their own difficulties by refusing to leave their homes when they can only be properly cared for in hospital or other suitable accommodation. A satisfactory solution is generally arrived at without resort to compulsion but in one case the Council took action under the above Act. This was the case of an elderly woman who had occupied one room in a house for many years. The tenants were not related to, or responsible for her in any way, and they complained bitterly of her state of health. She was more or less bedridden, incontinent at times, and was inclined to behave and speak irrationally. She refused to consider entering a Home and was not prepared to accept the domicilliary services such as District Nurse, Home Help, or Laundry Service. Her condition began to deteriorate and, since she was not receiving the care and attention she required, application was made to the Court for an Order for her Compulsory removal to a suitable accommodation. The Order was granted and she was removed to an Old Peoples' Home where she settled quite well. The Order was later extended or a further period of three months, and during this time, she finally ecided to remain permanently. 10 SECTIONS C, D, &. E.— SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES. The report of the Chief Public Health Inspector is included in Sections C, D, and E, of the Appendix, and reference to these indicates the large volume and varied nature of the work carried out by the Staff of the Health Department. SECTION F.— PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. (Civilians only). NOTIFIABLE DISEASES. The table in Section F sets out the number of cases of infectious diseases notified during 1959. Measles. The expected epidemic of measles occurred in the Spring and 555 cases were notified. Generally they were not severe, but 6 were considered to require hospital treatment. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough. Only 30 cases were notified and, of these, 2 were severe enough to require admission to hospital. Poliomyelitis. There was not a single case of poliomyelitis in the district during the year. The incidence throughout the country was low. Vaccination of a high proportion of children against the disease may have played an important part in the satisfactory state of affairs. Dysentery. Sixteen cases were notified and all except one were due to the organism Shigella sonnei. There was a small outbreak at a general hospital which involved six children and a nurse, otherwise the cases were confined to individual households. In one case a young woman was notified suffering from dysentery but the causal organism was not isolated. 11 Food Poisoning. Only three cases of food poisoning were notified and they were quite unrelated to one another. Two were caused by Salmonella typhimurium and in the third case the causal organism was not isolated. Scarlet Fever. Forty-nine cases were notified compared with 24 during the previous year. The cases were generally mild but in 10 instances admission to hospital was thought advisable. Pneumonia. Twenty-five cases were notified which is a considerable increase on previous years. Twenty-three of these occurred in the first quarter of the year, and eleven of them were children under the age of ten years. Eleven were treated in hospital. IMMUNIZATION. Schemes for giving protective inoculations against various diseases are administered from the Divisional Health Office, and are carried out at the Surrey County Council Clinics. Diphtheria and Whooping Cough. The majority of infants are inoculated against these diseases. Efforts are made to complete the course of injections before the end of the first year, but the policy of using single antigens during the warmer months makes this very difficult. The last recorded case of diphtheria was in 1944 and the incidence and severity of Whooping Cough have been considerably reduced in recent years. Tetanus. Protection against tetanus is being requested by an increasing number of parents. It is given combined with other antigens in the winter quarters and singly or combined with diphtheria formol Toxoid in summertime. 12 Smallpox. 60.9% of babies were vaccinated during the year. This is still nut high enough, but is a better figure than in many parts of the country. Poliomyelitis. Supplies of vaccine were adequate throughout the year. A close survey of the schools showed that nearly 30% of the children had not been registered for vaccination. With the helpful Co-operation of Head Teachers, arrangements were made for inoculation sessions to be held in the schools and the response was excellent. Well before the end of the year nearly every child in our schools had received the full course of three injections. As far as could be ascertained the only exceptions were a few objectors. In the Spring there was a sudden large demand from young people aged 15 to 25 years. Special sessions were arranged at convenient times and sessions were held in factories, the Technical Institute, Kew Gardens, and similar places where there were significant numbers of people in the appropriate age group. In addition to all this, an unknown number of our young people were inoculated at their place of work in London or elsewhere. Late in the year, the age limit was raised to forty— but the immediate response was slow. Tuberculosis. As in previous years all children aged 13 years were offered B.C.G. vaccination. The object is to provide artificial immunity to the disease during the adolescent period when children are susceptible and can be seriously affected.

Richmond has two separate sources of drinking water:— (a) From local wells. (b) From the Metropolitan Water Board. The origin and method of treatment of these supplies have been fully reported in previous years and remain unchanged. Both supplies are treated by chlorination: and very close observation of the purity of the water is maintained by frequent examinations of the water samples. During the year the following samples were taken for examination:— (a) Richmond Water Supply. Untreated water 156 samples Treated water 333 samples For chemical analysis 24 samples Every sample of treated water passing into public supply was of the highest standard of bacterial purity. Chemical analysis of samples showed that the organic quality of the water maintained a high and satisfactory standard. (b) Metropolitan Water Board Supply. Samples examined bacteriologically 976 Samples examined chemically (full analysis) 52 Samples of water are collected at all stages of the purification process at least five times each week and analysed at the laboratories of the Metropolitan Water Board. The results of these examinations indicated that a very high standard of chemical and bacteriological purity was maintained throughout the year. In addition to these two supplies of drinking water there is a supply of raw river water which is delivered to Kew Gardens, allotments and to the gardens of a proportion of the residences in Richmond. The water is chlorinated as a precautionary measure but is not fit for drinking. Sixty-six samples of river water were bacteriologically examined during the year. 23 The following figures show the daily average consumption from the three sources:— 1958 1959 All Richmond Wells 836,038 galls. 759,071 galls. Metropolitan Water Board 879,030 galls. 992,151 galls. Raw River Water 209,548 galls. 369,742 galls. The drinking water supplies in the district are not plumbosolvent. Water fit for human consumption is made available by piped supply to every dwelling house in the Borough. PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTIONS. For the following particulars I am indebted to the Chief Public Health Inspector, who submitted his Report in accordance with the Sanitary Officers (Outside London) Regulations, 1935. Inspections during 1959. Houses inspected and particulars recorded (Housing Act) 58 Houses inspected (Public Health Acts) 369 Revisits to houses and other premises 898 Houses visited for Certificates of Disrepair 57 Visits paid in connection with:— Permitted number for dwellings 94 Vermin 87 Enquiries into Infectious Diseases and Disinfection 281 Routine inspections in connection with:— Factories (mechanical) 35 Factories (non-mechanical) 2 Outworkers 10 Bakehouses 17 Butchers' Shops 44 Confectioners (Flour) 12 Confectioners (Sugar) 16 Dairies and Milk Shops 26 Fishmongers and Poulterers 11 Fried Fish Shops 10 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 44 Grocers 87 Ice-cream premises 130 24 Public Houses 44 Restaurants and Tea Shops 174 Food and Drugs Act Sampling 166 Milk Sampling (Designated Milk) 79 Ice-cream Sampling 58 Unsound Food 76 Clean Air Act—Inspection and Observations 688 Diseases of Animals Act 2 Drainage 367 Interviews 663 Heating Appliances (Fireguard) Act 13 Merchandise Marks Act 32 Pet Animals Act, 1951 8 Petroleum Act, 1928 167 Piggeries 3 Rag Flock Act Rats and Mice (Visits to Properties) 4317 Rats and Mice (Visits re sewer treatments) 827 Schools—Elementary and Secondary Shops Act, 1950 51 Water Supply 299 Miscellaneous Visits 1872 12,196 PUBLIC HEALTH CONTRAVENTIONS AND DEFECTS.

In the second case, a Nuisance Order was made for works of repair to be carried out in one month. COMPLAINTS. The number of complaints received was 716, which is a decrease of 2 compared with 1958. The complaints received have been classified as follows:— Disrepair of premises:— Dampness 25 Drainage 83 General Defects 170 Nuisance from Animals 6 Nuisance from Refuse 27 Nuisance from Smoke, fumes 40 Nuisance from Vermin 47 Rodent infestations 262 Unsound food 20 Miscellaneous Nuisances 36 716 Prompt investigation was made and suitable action taken to remedy the complaints. 27 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION OF PREMISES.

Evidence of bed-bug infestation in dwellinghouses continues to diminish ; spraying with a 5% D.D.T. solution in Kerosene remains the most economic and effective treatment, and no instance has been recorded in Richmond of Cimex Lectularius being resistant to D.D.T. An alternative treatment employing a 5% B.H.C. spray is also available in cases where D.D.T. is considered undesirable. The policy of spraying School Kitchens, operating under the School Meals Service, has been continued and involves one treatment annually of 5% D.D.T. solution which leaves a residual film of insecticide on the walls. The quantity of clothing fumigated before being sent abroad has increased in recent years; this service is carried out on behalf of members of the public to satisfy Post Office regulations, and a small charge is made for the treatment. 28 Factories Acts 1937 to 1959. At the end of the year there were 158 factories on the register (138 mechanical and 20 non-mechanical) and in addition, 8 premises were recorded for the purpose of Section 7 of the Act (suitability of sanitary accommodation) being Institutions or sites of building operations. The following information is given in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 1/60 dated the 8th January, 1960. PART 1 OF THE ACT. 1.

Richmond (Surrey) No. 1 Smoke Control Order, 1959. In accordance with the Council's decision that the whole of the Borough should be covered by successive Smoke Control Orders made under the Clean Air Act, 1956 within a ten-year programme, a survey was carried out during the year, of the first area. The area selected was in the south-west corner of Ham, some 85 acres in extent and comprising : 268 Council dwellings. 70 private dwellings. 3 other premises. To enable smokeless fuels to be used in this area, it was estimated that 447 firegrates would need to be renewed or adapted, together with the provision of 63 additional gas points, at a total cost of £2,286. The Exchequer contribution towards this sum would amount to £914, while the Rate Fund and the householders would each bear £686 of the cost. Preliminary approval for the scheme was given by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and by the end of the year the Order had been made and submitted for the Minister's confirmation. It is anticipated that the Order will come into operation on the 1st October, 1960. The Health Committee also considered Clean Air publicity during the year, and organisations in the Borough were reminded by letter of the Council's willingness to provide a speaker at meetings to discuss all aspects of the Clean Air campaign. It is pleasing to record that another member of the staff has been able to attend a course on the use of smokeless fuel appliances held at the Coal Utilisation Council Centre. Complaints of Smoke Emission. During 1959 forty complaints were received concerning smoke and fume emission. The growing number of complaints of bonfires in private gardens suggests that members of the public are becoming more conscious of the sources of unnecessary smoke and more aggrieved at the thoughtlessness of their neighbour. The redevelopment of building sites in Richmond produced other complaints of the nuisance caused by demolition contractors who are unwilling to 32 transport waste wood from the site and who persist in lighting large bonfires to burn unwanted materials. In all these cases improvements were secured on verbal warnings given by the Health Inspectors. Complaints of smoke emission from industrial chimneys continued to receive thorough investigation, and most problems were solved by ensuring proper maintenance of the plant concerned. In one instance, however, advice was sought by the owners from the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service as to alterations required to an underfeed stoker burning coal, and the adaptations made substantially reduced smoke emission from the plant. One other complaint of interest during the year arose from the staining of household laundry. A shirt, which had been dried in the garden of a house close to an industrial boilerhouse, was found to be covered with brown marks, and analysis showed the staining to be due to deposits of iron and sulphur compounds. The boilerhouse was served by a steel chimney in which extensive corrosion had occurred due to the acid formed from the sulphur content of the coal fuel. The acid had produced a sulphate of iron and under conditions of extreme condensation when, for example, the stack was cooling, there formed an extensive film of liquid charged with sulphate of iron which was emitted from the chimney as tiny droplets. On completion of the investigation, the owners of the plant agreed to erect a new enamelled metal chimney stack. Vehicle Smoke Emission. The Health Committee have discussed the growing problem of smoke emission from diesel engines in road vehicles. Undoubtedly this form of air pollution causes great irritation to road users and pedestrians alike, and yet it is the kind most easily avoidable, as the problem arises only because of the failure to provide regular engine maintenance. Excessive vehicle smoke emission is an offence under the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations administered by the police, but any substantial reduction of this source of pollution would require additional public spending for the creation of special police squads qualified to give the technical evidence necessary to secure convictions. On occasions it has been possible to record particulars of vehicles emitting excessive smoke in the Borough, and a letter to the company owning the vehicle has usually produced a promise to have the offending engine overhauled. 33 New Furnaces and Chimneys. The Clean Air Act provides that new furnace installations (exceeding 55,000 B.T.LTs. per hour) must be capable of operating without emitting smoke, and in accordance with Section 3 of the Act, the Council received notification of 29 proposals to install new furnaces. In addition, the Council approved plans of 2 new industrial chimneys under Section 10 of the Act, being satisfied that the height of the chimneys would ensure the proper dispersal of all flue gases so as not to cause any nuisance. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949. The rodent control section of the staff have done much useful work during the year in eradicating rats and mice from premises and foul sewers. A total of 4,317 visits was made to dwellings and business premises throughout the year. Complaints of infestation by rats or mice numbered 262 and inspection and investigation revealed rat infestation at 172 premises and mice infestation at 73 premises. By the end of the year infestation had been cleared at 221 of these premises. Treatment of the foul sewers was carried out on two occasions, a total of 827 visits being made for this purpose in connection with inspection, baiting, poisoning and checking results. The anti'Coagulant, Warfarin, was used for both sewer treatments and the work was concentrated upon specific areas in the Borough known to have been persistently infested with rats. The results of the two treatments are shown in the following table:— Treatment in May. Treatment in November. Manholes test baited (situated on perimeter of area selected for poison baiting) 36 50 Manholes found to be infested on test baiting Nil 5 Manholes poison baited (including any found to be infested on test baiting) 71 50 Manholes infested in treated area 27 26 There has been a marked and continued improvement in the work of sewer treatments, largely due to the diligence of the Rodent 34 Control staff, and the reduction in sewer infestations is clearly shown in the following figures: — 1950 (November treatment) 114 infested manholes. 1953 ( „ „ ) 77 „ „ 1956 ( „ ) 85 „ „ 1959 ( „ „ ) 26 „ „ During the year contracts were renewed with the Surrey County Council for regular visits to be made to schools and institutions, and other contracts were renewed with business premises in the Borough. These agreements are of value in that periodical visits by trained staff ensure that any evidence of rodent infestation is quickly noted and treatment applied. Such prompt action prevents an infestation becoming extensive, and indirectly lessens the risk of damage to goods and stock carried in the premises. SHOPS ACT, 1950. There are 793 shops on the Department's Register and 51 inspections were made during the year. In addition, however, the requirements of the Act were checked during visits to premises for other purposes, as for example, in the course of inspections of food premises. Advice was given from time to time on the employment of young persons, hours of closing, and other welfare provisions of the Act, and in one instance it was necessary to resort to legal proceedings to enforce these statutory requirements. This case was taken under Sections 31 and 32, Shops Act, 1950, and related to the illegal employment of a young person in a cafe after 10 p.m., and the failure of the propietor of the business to keep records of employment of young persons. Fines amounting to £3 were imposed. The Shops Act is not an easy statute to understand or to administer and the arrival at a correct interpretation of many of its sections often constitutes a journey of some difficulty to both traders and Council s officers. This is particularly so in the case of "mixed" trades, and one may example the proprietor of one business in the Borough who elected to sell gramophone records at the front of his shop and to conduct a coffee-bar at the rear. In order to comply with the Shops Act, the unfortunate proprietor on every Wednesday afternoon and Sunday had to cover up his entire stock of records and exhibit a noticc to the effect that the shop was open only for the sale of refreshments. 35 RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. This Act came into force on the 1st November, 1951 and briefly its provisions call for the registration of all premises in which Rag Flock or other filling materials, as defined in Section 33 of the Act (i.e.: Kapok; Woollen felt; Cotton flock, etc.) are used, in the manufacture of bedding, toys, babycarriages and other articles of upholstery. The Act also calls for the licensing of premises where Rag Flock is (a) Manufactured; (b) Stored for distribution to registered premises but no premises coming within this definition are situated within the Borough. Only one factory in the Borough has been registered, and no infringement of the provisions of the Act was observed. PET ANIMALS ACT 1951. This Act came into force on the 1st April, 1952 and is designed to secure for Pet Animals kept in shops, for sale to the Public, suitable accommodation as regards size, temperature, lighting, ventilation and cleanliness; adequate supplies of food and drinking water; prevention of sale at too early an age; precautions to prevent the spread of infectious diseases amongst the animals and precautions to be trken in case of fire or other emergency. No person may now keep a pet shop unless he obtains a licence from the Local Authority, and it is an offence to sell animals as pets in any part of a street or public place, except at a stall or barrow in a market, or to sell pets to children under 12 years of age. In the Act, "animals" is defined as including any description of vertebrate and as such includes goldfish and cage birds, which are the principal sales in the shops licensed in the Borough. Five premises hold licences from the Richmond Borough Council to carry on this business. Regular inspection of the premises is carried out, and a close liaison maintained with the Local representative of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Licences are renewable annually and an inspection is made before renewals are brought before the Council. 36 DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACT 1950. The number of outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease reported throughout England and Wales was not unduly serious in 1959. Richmond was not directly involved in any outbreak and was not affected by Infected Area Restrictions on any occasion. These restrictions control the movement of animals except for special purposes and for this purpose no licences were issued or countersigned. By contrast, the incidence of Fowl Pest was very heavy during the year, and in the last two weeks of November 398 outbreaks of the disease were reported throughout the country. One case was notified in Petersham among domestic chickens and the necessary control measures were brought into effect. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food appealed to local authorities to assist in a publicity drive to ensure that suspected cases of Fowl Pest were promptly dealth with. In Richmond, arrangements were made for the distribution through the schools of a pamphlet describing the symptoms of the disease and the action to be taken in notifying suspected cases, and the local Press gave a useful measure of co-operation in drawing the attention of the public to this problem. PETROLEUM (CONSOLIDATION) ACT 1928 AND REGULATIONS MADE THEREUNDER. Fifty-three premises within the Borough are licensed to store a total of 82,420 gallons of Petrol, Petroleum Mixtures and Cellulose solutions. They have received regular inspection to ensure that the various regulations have been observed. In all a total of 167 visits was made to the various installations and only minor infringements of the Regulations were found. The total licence fees amounted to £41 0s. 0d. The conditions of the licence to store petroleum spirit require that tanks shall be tested in the 20th, 25th and 30th year after installation and thereafter in every second year. During 1959, 26 tanks were tested and found to be satisfactory, and in addition, 9 new tanks were tested and found satisfactory in the construction of new installations or in the extension of existing installations. 37 The licence conditions also bring into force, on the 1st January, 1960, flameproofing regulations affecting electrical service pumps and their associated electrical fittings. In anticipation of these changes, 17 new flameproof pumps were fitted during the year at 5 petrol' filling stations. 38 SECTION D—HOUSING. Housing Statistics for the Year 1959. 1.

Nil 3. Housing Act, 1957: Unfit Houses. The representation of Grove Terrace and Motes Cottages was made early in the year; a public inquiry was held by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in June and confirmation of the Clearance Order was received late in September. By the end of the year progress was being made in the rehousing of the families in this area. Clearance Orders were also made by the Council in respect of Orchard Cottages and Orchard Road and in respect of Nos. 1-15, Garden Road. These Orders had not been confirmed by the end of the year and a further public inquiry was anticipated early in 1960. Representations were made to the Council on two individual unfit houses (310, Kew Road and 2, Water Lane) and meetings were arranged for the owners to submit proposals as to the future user of these properties; final decisions had not been reached by the end of 1959. The condition of three basement properties (82, Church Road, 81a and 81b, Mount Ararat Road) were reported during the year as 41 being unfit for human habitation; an undertaking to carry out repairs was made by the owner of one property (82, Church Road) and accepted by the Council. Undertakings in respect of the other two properties were anticipated early in 1960. During the year one Closing Order was determined (11, Park Road) and one undertaking cancelled (11, Mount Ararat Road) as in each case the owner had carried out works of repair which rendered the basements fit for human habitation. 4. Overcrowding. Overcrowding is still considerable throughout the Borough. The points scheme of House allocation usually covers the worst of these cases and their overcrowded conditions are relieved as and when houses are available. 5. Council Houses. Total number of houses erected post-war to 31st December, 1959 Temporary bungalows 179 Permanent houses 485 847 Permanent flats 362 1026 During 1957 and 1958, 55 Temporary Bungalows in Peldon Avenue and Ham Close were demolished and one taken over for use as a dental clinic by the Surrey County Council 56 970 Total number included in above, erected in 1959 Permanent houses Nil Permanent flats 114 Total number of families rehoused in 1959 108 Total number of families still on Waiting List at December 31st, 1959 393 Applications from aged persons as at 31st December, 1959. (List under review January, 1960) 333 Current Building Programme. By the end of March 1960, 64 1-bedroomed flats on the Lower Mortlake Road site (Finucane Court) will be ready for occupation 42 and will be used to rehouse Corporation tenants so that their underoccupied houses may be used more economically. A further 42 bedsitting room flats on the North Road site (McDougall Court) are due to be completed by May 1960 and will provide, for the first time, accommodation for the Older Persons from the Council's Waiting List. Housing of Older Persons. "Kingsbury", 10, King's Road, Richmond. The above converted property became available for letting in February 1960 and, in conjunction with the British Red Cross Society, 22 older persons were provided with accommodation together with the Resident Warden and Caretaker. Slum Clearance. Alternative accommodation has been provided for a number of families who were resident in unfit premises under the Slum Clearance Programme and it is hoped to complete the Grove Terrace and Mote's Cottages Clearance Order by June 1960. Future Building Programme. Town Planning approval has been obtained for the erection of 13 single-storey Old Persons' dwellings in terraces on the land at the rear of Popham Gardens. In February 1960 the redevelopment of the Ham Close site was deferred for six months. Requisitioned Premises. All requisitioned houses were released by November 1959. 6. Rent Act, 1957. The Rent Act, 1957, came into operation on the 6th July, 195, and repealed the Housing Repairs and Rent Act, 1954. The 1957 Act permits the rents of controlled houses to be in creased within specified limits, and lays down a proceedure to enable the tenant and landlord to reach agreement on works of repair which should be carried out to the property. Should agreement not be possible, the tenant may apply to the local authority for a Certificate of Disrepair which, if granted, stops 43 the rent increase. The landlord has the opportunity, however, of giving an undertaking to carry out the repairs within 6 months, and if such an undertaking is accepted by the local authority, the rent increase continues to be payable. The following tables show the action taken since the Act came into force: — PART 1. — Applications for Certificates of Disrepair. 1957 1958 1959 Number of applications 59 37 15 Number of decisions not to issue certificates Nil 4 1 Number of decisions to issue certificates:— (a) in respect of some but not all defects 37 29 7 (b) in respect of all defects 20 6 7 Number of undertakings given by landlords 47 24 9 Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority Nil 1 Nil Number of certificates issued 10 12 5 PART 2.— Applications for Cancellation of Certificates. Applications by landlords to local Authority for cancellation of certificates 4 8 3 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 1 2 1 Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objection 1 1 1 Certificates cancelled by Local Authority 4 7 3 44 SECTION E.—INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. Food Inspection. The following foodstuffs, found to be unfit for human consumption, were surrendered by the owners. Articles Tons Cwts. Qrs. lbs. Fish - - 1 12 Fruit and Vegetables — 7 3 4 Meat and Meat Products — - 3 23 Milk and Milk Products - 1 - — Tinned Goods (all classes) — 7 1 14 — 17 1 25 Whenever possible condemned food is salvaged to be used for animal feeding, but in all other cases, the food is destroyed by burning at the Refuse destructor. Twenty complaints alleging that food had been sold in a condition unfit for human consumption were received during the year and received full investigation. In general the complaints showed that the high standards of food equipment in shops and factories do not invariably safeguard food from human carelessness. The exceptionally hot summer of 1959 also produced an added need for proper food storage which was not appreciated, until too late, by some food traders — fortunately, relatively few in number. Eight complaints referred to mould in food, and in every case investigation showed that the turnover of stock had not been properly effected, although the intended arrangements for the storage and distribution of the products could not be faulted. Some carelessness was evident in two instances in which a milk bottle from a first class bottle-washing plant was delivered to the consumer without being in a thorough state of cleanliness. The most human error was revealed in the complaint of a cake having a soapy taste. It proved that the baker had made a chocolate fondant covering, and in order to avoid waste, had mixed in some left-over lemon fondant. An enzyme in the lemon oil produced a fatty-acid in the chocolate fondant with its characteristic soapy taste. Although no legal proceedings were taken during the year, the Council authorised one prosecution under the Food and Drugs Act, 45 1955 in respect of a complaint alleging that a loaf of bread had contained a cigarette end, and the hearing of this case was expected early in 1960. Food and Drugs Act, 1955. (Sampling of Food and Drugs). The following table shows the results of examinations made of samples procured for analysis during the year. Articles. Number Analysed Adulterated or Irregular Formal Informal Total Formal Informal Total Acetic Acid - 1 1 — — — Aspirin — 2 2 — — — Beans — 2 2 — — — Cakes — 9 9 — — — Cereals — 3 3 — — — Cheese and Cheese Spread — 4 4 — 3 3 Coconut, Shredded — 1 1 — — 1 Cordials - 8 8 — 1 Cream — 2 2 — — — Cress - 1 1 — 1 1 Cough Mixtures and Tonics — 9 9 — 1 — Eggs, Scotch — 1 1 — 1 1 Friars Balsam — 3 3 — 1 — Fish and Fish Products — 5 5 — 1 1 Fruit — 2 2 — — — Glycerine — 1 1 — — — Jams and Marmalade - 8 8 — 4 4 Ice-Cream - 3 3 — 1 1 Margarine — 1 1 — — — Mayonnaise, Lemon — 1 1 — — — Meat and Meat Products. - 20 20 — 1 — Milk 5 1 6 — — — Mushroom Soup — 1 1 — — — Parsley Powder — 1 1 — — — Salad Oil — 3 3 — — — Sandwich Filling — 2 2 — — — Sauces - 2 2 — — — Sweets - 20 20 — 2 2 Syrups — 3 3 — — — Tea - 3 3 — 1 1 Whiskey 1 1 2 — — — Totals 6 124 130 — 18 18 It is interesting to note that whereas in the County of Surrey (excluding Richmond) the percentage of adulterated or irregular samples for 1959 was 4½%, the corresponding figure for Richmond was 14%, and this high standard in sampling reflects the interest and enthusiasm of the sampling officers in this branch of the Department's work. 46 The annual report on food sampling would not be complete without reference to the help and advice given by the Public Analyst (D. D. Moir, Esq., MSc., F.R.I.C.). The correspondence with manufacturers, importers and wholesalers, which inevitably follows upon an adulterated or irregular sample has been brought to a successful conclusion on many occasions because of the close co-operation and assistance given by Mr. Moir, and it is pleasing to record the helpful relationship which has grown up since Richmond undertook sampling duties in 1954. Sample No. 499 : Bombay Duck. Added salt not disclosed on label: agreement with importers to amend labelling to comply with Labelling of Food Order, 1953. Sample No. 500 : Cheese and Ham Spread. Reported to be deficient in butterfat and not to be correctly labelled : agreement reached with the manufacturers and importers that butterfat content would be increased and the product labelled to comply with the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. Sample No. 516 : Lean Mince Beef. Contained 23 per cent of fat: butcher undertook to keep a reasonable proportion of fat (not more than 15 per cent) in any mince described as "lean". Samples Nos. 544 & 545 : Marmalade and Raspberry Jam. Both jams were home-made and deficient in soluble solids: stocks withdrawn from sale and advice given on use of jam-making thermometer. Sample No. 551 : Butter Nougat. Imported from Germany and found not to resemble nougat as known in this country: agreement reached with importers on new description for this product. Sample No. 555 : Tea. A newspaper advertisement described the tea as "tiny little leaves" whereas analysis showed the sample to be tea obtained by comminuting leaves of normal size to tiny fragments. The company undertook not to use this description in future in their advertising. 47 Sample No. 556: Rum Chocolate. A chocolate block filled with a puree of raisins flavoured with rum: the manufacturers agreed to amend the description so as to avoid any risk misleading a purchaser as to the nature of the product. Sample No. 559: Frig-Ice. The label did not identify the vegetable stabiliser used as an ingredient: the manufacturers undertook to produce a new carton label to comply with the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. Sample No. 563: Parmesan Cheese. The label claimed that the cheese contained 32% fat whereas analysis showed the sample to contain only 27% fat. The manufacturers agreed to re-label the product without reference to any claim as to the fat content. Sample No. 588: Orange Squash. The label did not disclose the name and address of the manufacturers : subsequently the label was amended to comply with the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. Sample No. 591: Scotch Eggs. The sausage meat covering contained only 37 per cent of meat: the manufacturers undertook that in future the product would have sausage meat containing not less than 50 per cent of meat. Samples Nos. 595 & 596: Strawberry Jam and Damson Jam. These samples were home-made jams found to be deficient in soluble solids: advice was given in each case on the use of a jammaking thermometer. Sample No. 597: Cold and Influenza Mixture. Sample showed deficiency in one ingredient: retailer agreed to dispense only small quantities of the mixture so as to avoid risk of the deterioration of an unstable ingredient. Sample No. 598: Friars Balsam. Deficient in total solids to the extent of 7.5 per cent: the manufacturing company undertook to ensure full analytical control testing of all future batches of this product. 48 Sample No. 612: Cheese Spread. The ingredients were not declared on the label, and the importing company undertook to stop supplying the trade with this product until the necessary labelling amendment had been effected. Sample No. 617: Cress. The sample was found to be rape and not cress: the retailers agreed not to use the description "cress" for this product. Merchandise Marks Act, 1926. Orders in Council have been made under Section 2 of the Act which require certain imported foods to bear an indication of their origin when exposed for retail sale. Thirty-two visits were made during the year for the purpose of advising retailers on these Orders, particularly in regard to the sale of imported apples, tomatoes and meat. Attention was also drawn, in one instance, to the need to indicate the origin of prepacked mixed nuts and fruit, and in two cases, fishmongers were requested to use descriptions of fish from the names recommended by the White Fish Authority. Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. The Act requires that any article sold by retail which includes a substance recommended as a medicine, must be labelled so as to disclose the name and quantity of each active ingredient. During the year the requirements of the Act were drawn to the attention of the manufacturers of a Cough Candy and the company undertook to market the sweets in future without any recommendation as a medicine. In another instance, the Department examined a skin preparation for the treatment of blackheads, acne, etc., which failed to identify the ingredients used. With the co-operation of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain agreement was reached with the company concerned and approval given to a form of declaration as to the active ingredients of this product. 49 CLASSIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES. The following table classifies food premises in the Borough according to the principal business carried on, and sets out the visits made to each class of trade:— BUSINESS No. of Premises No. of Visits Bakehouses 8 17 Butchers (includes 33 premises registered for the manufacture of preserved food) 34 44 Confectioners (Flour) 15 12 Confectioners (Sugar) 41 16 Dairies (premises registered under Milk and Dairies Regulations) 5 26 Fishmongers 15 11 Greengrocers 35 44 Grocers 73 87 Ice-Cream Premises (Registered for Manufacture) 2 130 Ice-Cream Premises (Registered for Sale and Storage) 115 Licensed Premises 78 44 Restaurants, Cafes, etc 78 174 499 605 IMPROVEMENTS IN FOOD PREMISES. The standard of hygiene required in food premises is set out in the Food Hygiene Regulations 1955. Throughout the post-war years, considerable attention has been focused, in Richmond, on attaining higher standards in food premises, and successive annual reports give evidence of the ready co-operation extended by proprietors and managements in achieving this end. It is therefore pleasing to record that during the year the work of implementing the Regulations was effected with the same degree of harmony and without recourse to statutory action. 50 As the result of the inspections made the following improvements have been carried out:— 1. Food rooms reconstructed 22 premises 2. Food rooms repaired, cleansed or redecorated 133 „ 3. Food storage improved 15 „ 4. Food preparation equipment renewed 86 „ 5. Ventilation and lighting of food rooms improved 3 „ 6. Staff washing facilities improved 27 „ 7. Staff clothing accommodation provided 30 „ 8. First aid boxes provided 24 „ 9. Constant hot water supply installed 22 „ 10. New sinks provided 16 „ 11. Existing sanitary accommodation improved 3 „ 12. Drainage improved, repaired or altered 36 13. Refuse accumulations removed 19 „ 14. Refuse receptacles provided 13 „ 15. Other improvements or repairs carried out 259 „ Codes of Practice. The need for higher standards of hygiene in food shops has been recognised for many years, and although some premises are exemplary in matters of reconstruction, equipment and food handling techniques, the majority of shops do not enjoy these standards. The Ministers of Health and of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food jointly issued, during the year, codes of practice for the Retail Meat Trade and for the Transport of Meat, and it is intended that codes of practice for other food trades shall eventually follow. The standards set out in each code have no legal significance, but the code can provide a challenge and encouragement to traders to attain better food handling standards. For this reason, the Council agreed that a copy of the code for the Retail Meat Trade should be sent, free of charge, to each meat retailer in the Borough. Slaughterhouses Act, 1958. This Act placed upon the Council the responsibility of submitting to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food a report on the existing and probably future requirements of the district for slaughter house facilities together with the slaughtering facilities which arc available to meet those requirements. 51 After consultation with such organisations and persons as appeared to represent the interests concerned, the Council submitted to the Minister a report that the existing slaughterhouse facilities outside the Borough were adequate, and that there was no evidence to suggest that these facilities would be inadequate for Richmond in the future. Ice-Cream. Premises manufacturing, storing or selling Ice-Cream have been regularly supervised, a total of 130 visits being made. Two premises are registered for the manufacture of ice-cream, and 115 premises are registered for sale and storage ; both manufacturers carry out the heat-treatment of ice-cream by raising the product to a temperature of not less than 160°F. for 10 minutes, and the high-temperature-shorttime method of heating to 175°F. for 15 seconds, permitted by the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations, 1952, is not in use. Sixty-six samples were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination, of which 59 were satisfactory (Grades I and II) and 7 were unsatisfactory (Grade III). The policy in sampling is to concentrate upon premises which have produced unsatisfactory samples in the past, and to sample only occasionally those dealers who produce good results. The standard of ice-cream production, storage and sale is generally high and complies with the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations, 1947/52. Milk—Licencing and Sampling.

During the year 51 children were given courses of inoculations against Tetanus at the parents' request. 55 TUBERCULOSIS. Vaccination Against Tuberculosis. Each year children who have reached their 13th year are offered vaccination against tuberculosis with B.C.G. (Bacille Calmette- Guerin). The inoculation is preceded by a Mantoux skin test which indicates whether or not the child has already been infected with tuberculosis. Those who have already been infected are not given the inoculation but they are investigated by X-Rays and by enquiries regarding home contacts. The object of the scheme is to provide resistance to tuberculosis during the adolescent period when children are most susceptible to the infection. During 1959 a total of 525 boys and girls were inoculated with B.C.G. in the Northern Division (Richmond and Barnes). NOTIFICATIONS: Respiratory Tuberculosis. Twenty-nine cases of respiratory tuberculosis were notified during the year, viz:—18 males and 11 females. The corresponding figure for 1958 was 29. Non-Respiratory Tuberculosis. Four new cases of non-respiratory tuberculosis were notified during the year and there were no deaths from this cause. Three such cases were notified during 1958. TUBERCULOSIS REGISTER.
