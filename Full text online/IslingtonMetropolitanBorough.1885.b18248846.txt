ISL 53 REPORT on THE SANITARY CONDITION of the Parish of St. Mary, Islington DURING THE YEAR 1885.

In 1875 it was 244,680; in 18G5 about 170,000. In other words, the population of Islington has nearly doubled in twenty years. The death rate of 1885 in Islington was 16.7. It is the smallest death-rate on record. Very pregnant facts these. I pray you, consider them for a moment. Startling enough on a small scale, such details become matters for anxiety when we consider them, not as Islingtonians, but as Englishmen. Put the population of England (England and Wales) at 24,000,000, and the acreage of cultivated land at 30,000,000. This gives one person to 125 acres—about one-fourth the quantity of land per head of the population in the whole of Europe. But the population is increasing. Statistics show that every 10,000 people at the commencement of a year become 10,150 at its close. About twenty generations have passed since the Norman Conquest. What will be the result when twenty more generations of Englishmen are numbered amongst the dead and gone ? Why, a population of 27,220,000,000, requiring a place of abode, which, to be no more populous than we are at the present moment, would need twenty earths for their habitation. What when only seven generations, say 294 years ? A population of English people greater in number than the world contains at the present time. But, you say, why trouble about what will be the result when twenty, or even when seven generations have passed ? The increase of the population has been startling in its suddenness. In the reign of Henry VIII. the population of England, kept in check by wars and pestilence, numbered not more than 5,000,000, whilst in the early part of the reign of George III. it was about 7,500,000. Commercial supremacy, our minerals and our manufactures, made us rich. With richness came numbers. The population of England reached 10 or 11 millions 6 about the termination of the Napoleonic wars, and 10,000,000 at the period of the repeal of the Corn Laws. Now we have to tell of 24,000,000 human beings to be fed and housed. Are these startling facts (they are facts) matters for congratulation or the reverse ? We must not shirk the fact, that, whilst an increase of population may be a sign of prosperity, it is a subject for deep anxiety. Bodies need elbow room, mouths need food;—and the more bodies and the more mouths, the more room and the more food required. Our exports are things that cannot be eaten; our imports consist largely of eatables. Of the food required for this 24,000,000 of mouths, nearly 50 per cent, comes from abroad. I doubt the healthy condition of a nation that cannot maintain itself. Working men, I fear, too often forget that they are each others customers. Increased wages mean loss as well as gain, for more pay does not mean increased purchasing power. An increasing population and a declining trade—these are serious facts for the sanitarian and sociologist. It is customary for Health Officers to point with pride to their low death rate as evidence of the value of their sanitary work. It is, no doubt, a pleasant message I have to convey, that our death rate for 1885 is the lowest on record. But I must also tell you (and before me. as I write, are carefully prepared statistics proving this to be the case) that the mortality of forty years ago was no greater, no less, than the mortality of to-day. I honestly do not believe you will ever absolutely reduce the death rate, even supposing it was desirable to do so; and it is the genius of the practical sanitarian to grasp the impossible as well as the possible, lest he lose time over that which profiteth not. The practical sanitarian sees the value of sanitary efforts in the general improvement of the people. He sees the finger of power pointing him to the necessity for better homes for our poor, the improved habits of the people being the means, if not of lengthening life, at any rate of rendering that life happy, useful and contented. I submit herewith the detailed statistics of births, deaths and marriages for the year 1885 (which for the purposes of 7 tration consisted of 52 weeks, ending the 2nd January, 1886), and also the details of our sanitary work (in accordance with the requirements of the Act of Parliament) for the year ending March 25th, 1886.

The death-rate of Islington during the past year has been 16.7 per 1,000 of the population. There has been a total of 5,323 deaths recorded in the Parish, of which 2,589 were males, and 2.734 females. I have continued to adopt for statistical purposes the four Registration Districts into which the Parish was recently divided, and both the births and deaths have been tabulated in accordance with the new arrangement. Of the 5,323 total deaths registered in Islington, 1,745 occurred in Upper Holloway, 1,714 in Islington South West, 1,014 in Islington South East, and 850 in Highbury. The actual number of deaths this year is rather more than the total number of the previous year, but taking the increase of the population into account, the death-rate of 16 7 per 1,000 is the lowest to be found upon our Islington records. It is noteworthy that this abnormally low death-rate again occurs in conjunction with an abnormally low birth-rate. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. In the following table I have arranged according to age the deaths that have taken place in Islington from the year 1881 to 1885, in elusive:— 1881. 1882. 1883. 1884. 1885.

The deaths from Diphtheria also rose from 114 to 138. The number of deaths attributable to Diseases of the Respiratory Organs was largely in excess of the previous year, whilst the deaths from Diarrhoea and from Tubercular and some other specific Diseases were considerably below those of last year. SMALL-POX. Small-pox was again severely epidemic, especially during the first six months of the year. It gradually subsided in July and August, and may be said to have ceased as an epidemic by the end of September, having been prevalent amongst us at Islington, and in London generally, for about one year and eight months. A further brief reference to this epidemic, with Tables relating to the same, will be found on a subsequent page. Measles was the most fatal epidemic of the year, the deaths reaching 289, the highest number ever recorded in Islington, as against 125, 165, 153, 161, 48, and 219 in the six preceding years. The greatest fatality which attended the disease chiefly occurred during the six months extending from March to August, both months inclusive. Diphtheria was again epidemic during the year, the deaths, which were nearly equally distributed over the twelve months, having risen to 138, as against 114, 70, 54, and 42, in the four previous years. The area over which the disease ranged was rather more extended than in the preceding year, but the Eastern portion of Upper Holloway continued to be the district principally affected by the disease. I am glad, however, to be now able to state that during the first six months of the present year (1886) the epidemic has been apparently subsiding, the number of deaths having been only 26, as against 64 in the corresponding six months of the year under review. 12 Scarlatina caused only 29 deaths, the smallest number ever recorded in Islington since 1855 as attributable to this disease. The next lowest number was 43 in 1873, whilst the highest number recorded was 465 in 1870. The smallness of the number of deaths from this disease is not the only fact worthy of note, for it was again observable that the districts chiefly affected by Diphtheria were those which suffered the least from Scarlatina. The deaths from Scarlatina in the previous ten years were 57, 95, 142, 116, 198, 135, 173, 200, 125 and 222. Whooping Cough continued to be severely epidemic. Although apparently declining during the last five months of 1884, it broke out again in January 1885, with renewed intensity, the deaths during the year reaching 200, as against 268, 119, 299, and 172 in the four previous years. Diarrhcea caused 191 deaths, as against 266, 162, 149, 216. and 295 in the five previous years. The largest number of deaths occurred, as usual, in the months of July and August. To Fever generally only 55 deaths were referred, as against 83, 86, 77, and 79 in the four previous years. THE SMALL-POX EPIDEMIC, 1884 & 1885. The epidemic of Small-Pox, to which I must now again refer, may be said to have extended over a period of nearly two years. This will be seen from the following table of 1,267 cases of sickness and 222 deaths, chiefly recorded between February, 1884, and September, 1885. The numbers, which rapidly increased after February, 1884, reached their maximum in January and February, 1885, with 170 cases and 28 deaths, and 133 cases and 27 deaths, in those two months respectively. From March, however, the numbers, with some variation, gradually decreased, until in September, 1885, there were only 9 cases recorded, with four deaths. In the following month no case was recorded, and in November and December there was an average number of six cases only in each month. 13 Table of 1,267 cases of Small-pox recorded monthly and 222 Deaths as occurring in Islington from the 1st January, 1884, to the 31st December, 1885.

Of 1,099 persons said to have been vaccinated, 150 died, or 137 per cent. 971 patients were removed to Hospital. Of these 159 died, or 16.4 per cent. 296 patients were treated at their own homes. Of these 63 died, or 21.3 per cent. 14 Of the 971 cases removed 918 were admitted to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan District Asylum Board. Of these 148, or 161 per cent, died. 53 patients were received at the Highgate Hospital. Of these 11 died, or 20.8 per cent.

During the twelve months ending December, 1885, I examined 112 samples of food, all of which were submitted by your Inspectors, no samples having been submitted to me by the Public. This makes in all 1,463 samples of food examined for Islington since my appointment. The 112 samples submitted by your Inspectors consisted of:— 4 Milk 4 Chicory 4 Port Wine 4 Black Tea 5 Gin 4 Green Tea 4 Brandy 4 Moist Susfar 4 Rum 4 Mustard 3 Whisky 2 AVhite Pepper 4 Fourpenny Ale 4 Cayenne Pepper 4 Porter 4 Lard 4 Bread 4 Flour 8 Butter 4 Oatmeal 4 Cheese 4 Pickles 4 Arrowroot 4 Mixed Sweets 4 Cocoa 4 Lime Juice 4 Coffee 2 Black Pepper Of the 112 samples submitted for examination I found none adulterated or containing injurious admixture. I have further, in an Appendix attached hereto, published in extenso, for the information of the Vestry, my four Quarterly Reports as Analyst, together with their accompanying Schedules, and for further details I refer the reader to these reports. THE MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT, 1885. From the 1st January to the 31st December, 1885, 584 bodies were received at the Mortuary, the daily average being 16. 342 inquests have been held during the same period, the sum of 18 £52 2s. 6d. having been paid to the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. The proportion of inquests to deaths was about 6.4 per cent, for the whole year. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR, 1885-86. Table No. VI. This table of our Sanitary work has been prepared in the usual manner, showing in the upper portion the number and variety of the Inspections, re-inspections, and calls made by the District Inspectors during the year, and in the lower portion the amendments effected. In addition, the District Inspectors have also reported the premises from which they have found removal of dust to be necessary. By the authority of the Sanitary Committee, Carbolic Acid was again used during the summer months in watering some of the streets. Disinfecting Powder was also used in the hottest and driest part of the season in the courts, and in connection with the Sunday morning cleansing of the channels of the Essex, Caledonian, and Holloway roads, where these thoroughfares are used as market-places until late on Saturday night. It will be seen from this table that a much larger number of inspections were made and corresponding improvements effected than usual, notwithstanding the continuance of the epidemics of Small-p ox and Diphtheria, the excess being chiefly due to the fact that one extra Inspector was employed in the work during the whole of the year, and that three other Inspectors were also employed during the last nine months of the year. THE SLAUGHTER AND COW-HOUSES IN ISLINGTON, 1885-86. At the Annual Licensing of 1885 there were 78 applications for renewal of licenses to Slaughter-houses, and the whole of them were granted. For the renewal of licenses to Cow-houses, 39 applications were 19 made and 38 were granted, one being refused upon the ground that no Cows had been kept for several years. 78 Slaughter-houses and 38 Cow-houses were therefore licensed. My annual inspection of these places, prior to the licensing, proved them to be in a satisfactory condition. SUMMONSES. During the year ending 25th March, 1886, seven summonses were i ssued by direction of the Sanitary Committee. One was for the recovery of the cost of disinfection incurred by the Vestry in default of the Owner complying with the usual notice, and an order being made by the Magistrate, the amount (17s. Gd.) was paid, with costs. Two summonses were issued against persons for keeping animals so as to be a nuisance, and the Magistrate made an order for abatement in each case. One of these two defendants was also summoned for obstructing the Inspector in the performance of his duty, and he was bound over to keep the peace for six months. Two other summonses were taken out on account of defective drainage, and in one case the work was carried out whilst the summons stood adjourned. In the second case the summons was heard, and an order made by the Magistrate for the necessary works to be carried out within seven days, and for the payment of 10s. costs. The Defendant, however, having failed to complete the work satisfactorily, he was again summoned for non-compliance, when having promised to finish the work, the Magistrate allowed the summons to stand adjourned for a fortnight, before the expiration of which the works were properly completed and the costs paid. The appeal of the Saint Pancras builder against a conviction which imposed upon him penalties amounting to £0, and £2 2s. costs for disobedience to a Magistrate's order, made during the previous year, to abate a nuisance arising from the overflow of sewage in the Brecknock Road (the history of which was given fully in my last 20 Annual Report), was only finally determined at the October Quarter Sessions of 1885. The judgment on that occasion was delivered by the Assistant Judge, Mr. Edlin, and the Appellant was relieved from the payment of the penalties and costs referred to, the conviction against him being quashed in consideration of his having kept the promise he made to the Judge at the first hearing of the appeal of paying the £30 contribution to the Constructors of the Islington Sewer in Southcotc Road, and of carrying out the works necessary for connecting the two sewers and thus abating the nuisance. Both the Vestry and the Appellant were directed to pay their own costs. Of course such decisions may be an easy method of solving difficulties, but they are not in any sense calculated to encourage Local Authorities in the exercise of the powers conferred upon them by the Sanitary Acts, which it is their duty to administer and enforce. THE DWELLINGS OF THE POOR. Referring to the 14 different properties described in my last year's Report, page 25, and consisting of 76 houses, I may now further report that the houses in Mildmay Avenue (7) have been thoroughly renovated and are being re-occupied. Some of these houses have, in fact, been almost rebuilt. The houses in Broad Yard (7) are at the present time also undergoing extensive alterations and improvements. The houses in Elliott's Place (7) and in Providence Place (7), all of which still remain closed, are the only properties which at the present moment are undealt with. THE VESTRY'S SANITARY STAFF. The record of our Sanitary work would not, however, be complete without some special reference to the addition which has been made by the Yestry to their Sanitary Staff, and, as the best mode of doing this, I therefore incorporate herewith the Report of the Sanitary 21 Committee as to the Re-organisation of the Staff, which the Vestry practically adopted, except in regard to the higher salaries therein recommended. Two reports containing many details upon this important subject, which were made to the Sanitary Committee by Mr. Collingwood and myself, will also be found in an appendix attached to the Report of the Committee. 22 TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON, Gentlemen, Your Sanitary Committee Report:— That for a considerable time past they have had under their anxious consideration the necessity of re-organising and materially increasing the sanitary staff' of this large and important parish. That the amount of the work devolving upon the present comparatively small sanitary staff' has for many years been gradually increasing is clearly apparent to your Committee, as they think it must be to the Vestry at large. One of the more immediate causes of this, as it is eertainly the most striking, is no doubt the enormous growth of the district, as shown by the great and rapid increase of the population. To illustrate this it may be stated that upon the formation of the Vestry in 1856, when two Inspectors were appointed, the population was 125,000, and in 1866, when two additional Inspectors were appointed, the population was 183,695, the increase being about 58,700; whilst in 1885 the estimated population was 310,000, showing an addition in the 19 years of 126,000. This vast increase in the population has, therefore, of itself, added very much to the work of the Sanitary Department, not only in respect to the proportionate increase in the number of deaths arising from infectious and other diseases, and in the number of complaints received from the inhabitants, but more particularly in the extension of those unsanitary conditions resulting from the greater density of population. Legislation has also added largely to the work to be performed, the Sanitary Act of 1866, and other subsequent Sanitary Acts, the Bakehouse Regulation Act, recently re-enacted by the Factory and Workshops' Amendment Act, the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Acts, the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, being some of the enactments which have tended in this direction. 23 The more recent adoption by the Vestry of the provision made in the Sanitary Act of 1866, &c., for the Registration and Regulation of Houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than ono family, has also entailed additional labour, both in the office and in the supervision of the 200 houses already registered under these Regulations, and this extra labour must still further be increased as more houses are placed upon the Register. It is, moreover, apparent to your Committee from the Report of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Poor, the exigencies of public opinion, and the freer exercise of the right of complaint by the inhabitants, that a large extension in the way of the sanitary inspection of houses has become a necessity, and your Committee are, therefore, of opinion that a material increase of the sanitary staff is indispensable, and they trust that the Vestry of Saint Mary, Islington, will set an example to the Metropolis by providing for such increased sanitary activity. Your Committee have further had before them two Reports upon the subject prepared by their direction by the Medical Officer of Health and the Sanitary Superintendent, which they submit herewith, and which they have taken generally as the bases of their deliberations.* The detailed statistics contained therein have been duly taken into account in calculating the extent to which the staff ought, in the opinion of the Committee, to be increased. These Reports have been printed, and will be in the hands of the Vestry before this Report is presented. The Vestry are aware, from your Committee's report of the 12th July, 1885, that in consequence of the necessity which they had felt for increased assistance there were at that time four temporary Inspectors employed in the sanitary work of the parish, and the services of these Inspectors have since been retained pending the further decision ot the Vestry. From the experience thus gained, your Committee are convinced both of the wisdom of this step and of its moderation, and they are * The Reports referred to are for convenience printed as an Appendix. 24 therefore of opinion that the four temporary Inspectors should now ho permanently appointed to the sanitary staff. This permanent alteration must of necessity considerably increase the clerical work of the department, which would he provided for by the appointment of two clerks. The temporarily increased clerical work has been met since July 1885, by the two clerks and messenger working overtime, for which overtime they have, of course, been paid, and which rendered unnecessary the employment of the temporary clerk at 30s. per week authorised by the Vestry. Should the four temporary Inspectors be permanently appointed the staff for out-door work would consist of eight Inspectors, including the Inspector of Dust, whose duties the Committee now propose shall be shared by all. It is proposed to divide the parish into eight districts, each comprising on an average 40,000 inhabitants, and about 5,000 houses. To each separate district an Inspector would be appointed who should undertake the supervision of the dusting and all other sanitary matters in connection with the division assigned to him from time to time. Your Committee have also had under consideration tho question of the salaries now paid to the four permanent Inspectors, and having regard to their long, faithful and thoroughly efficient services, and to the salaries paid to Sanitary Inspectors elsewhere, they feel that they cannot do less than recommend them a moderate addition to their present salary, which is only 40s. per week. In pursuance, therefore, of your Committee's opinions, as expressed in this Report, they submit the following recommendations:— 1. That the four temporary Inspectors now in the employment of the Vestry, viz., Messrs. Arthur Perry, Tom Anderson, William Rolfe, and George Morgan, be appointed Inspectors of Nuisances and Sanitary Inspectors, at a commencing salary of 34s. per week each from 1st January, 1886, with an annual increase of 4s. per week to a maximum of 50s. 25 2. That the junior Clerk, George H. King, be appointed second clerk in the office of the department at a commencing salary of £50 per annum, with an annual increase of £5 to a maximum of £100, the first increase to take place from the 1st January, 1886. 3. That the Messenger, Frederick William Saffrey, be appointed third clerk in the office of the department at a commencing salary of £40 per annum, with an annual increase of £5 to a maximum of £80, the first increase to take place from the 1st January, 1886. 4. That the Committee be authorised to appoint a junior clerk, at 10s. per week, with an annual increase of 2s. to a maximum of £1 per week; and also a messenger in the place of Frederick William Saffrey upon the usual terms of 8s. per week and uniform, with an annual increase of Is., to a maximum of 12s. per week. 5. That the salaries of the permanent inspectors, Messrs. James Burney Pain, George West, James Jarvis Jordan, and Charles Turle Wilson, be increased from 40s. by an annual increase of 5s. per week to a maximum of 50s., the first increase to take effect from 1st January, 1886. 6. That the salary of the clerk, Mr. Alfred Canter, be increased from 20s. to 25s. per week from the 1st January, 1886. Your Committee have felt that their report would be incomplete unless they dealt with the salary of your Sanitary Superintendent, Mr. Collingwood, who has been receiving, since 1880, £4 per week. Having regard to the large increase in the work of the Sanitary Department of late years, which has involved Mr. Collingwood either staying after office hours or taking work home with him, without receiving extra remuneration, and to the additional work and responsibility that must of necessity result from the suggested reorganisation of the department, your Committee have unanimously resolved to recommend the Vestry:— 7. That the salary of the Sanitary Superintendent (Mr. Colling- 2G wood) bo raised from £4 to £5 per week as from the 1st January, 1886, and they recommend the same accordingly. In submitting this last recommendation to the Vestry, and as an additional reason for asking its acceptance, they cannot resist expressing the high value they entertain of Mr. Collingwood's services, for his untiring devotion to the work of the Vestry, in their capacity as a Sanitary Authority, and for his faithful and impartial management, for a period of 19 years, of the sanitary staff. All which is submitted. HENRY QUILTER, Chairman Sanitary Committee. Vestry Offices, Upper Street, N., 11th January, 1886. 27 APPENDIX. FIRST REPORT, THE VESTRY OF ST, MARY, ISLINGTON, TO THE SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, In reporting upon the Sanitary Staff and their duties we deem it desirable to point out, in the first place, that upon the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the constituting of the Vestry as the Local Authority, and also as the Nuisance Authority under the Nuisance Removal Act for England, 1855, the Vestry appointed a Medical Officer of Health and two Inspectors of Nuisances, tho clerical work necessary in connection with these officers being carried out by the clerks employed in the Vestry Clerk's offices. At that time (1856) the Parish contained about 125,000 inhabitants, with 16,660 houses. Ten years later (May, 1866) two additional Inspectors were appointed, the population being then 183,695, in 23,273 houses. In April of the following year (1867), one of the additional Inspectors having resigned, a Superintendent Inspector was appointed and a separate Sanitary Department created, with a staff of three Inspectors engaged in District inspection work, and the Superintendent, who received and gave directions, kept the sanitary records, and conducted the business and correspondence of the office. The passing of the Sanitary Act, 1866, which made the inspection of the district for the purpose of ascertaining the existence of nuisances 28 and the necessity for disinfection after infectious diseases, and also the inspection of bakehouses under the Bakehouse Regulation Act, 1864, essential parts of the Sanitary work, greatly extended the Inspectors' duties, and these being still further increased by the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Between 1856 and 1867 additional Inspectors were employed on several occasions, e.g., during the Cattle Plague of 1865. From 1867 to 1884, however, no additional assistance was received in the work of inspection, either temporary or otherwise. In 1871, when the population was 213,000, and the number of inhabited houses was 27,000, the work of the Department was again farther increased by the transfer of the control of the Dusting of the Parish from the Vestry Clerk's office and his immediate supervision to the Sanitary Department. The Inspector of Dust, who was then also an Inspector of Lamps, having resigned, a special Inspector of Dust was appointed in connection with your Department, where complaints have ever since been inquired into, recorded, and tabulated, a junior clerk being also appointed to assist in the office. The Resolution of the Vestry was as follows:— "Resolved,—That the Dust Inspector and the Superintendence of the Dust contract be transferred from the Vestry Clerk's Department to that of the Sanitary." Gamed unanimously. (3rd February, 1871.) Except in the purchasing of samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and, in cases of emergency, the time of the Inspector of Dust has been fully occupied with his special work in the Dusting of the Parish, and invisiting and re-visiting the houses in the poorer localities of the District. Upon the question of the Staff, it is right to remind the Committee that for many years messengers were sent daily to the Vestry by the Trustees and Guardians of the Poor, the Sanitary Department usually having three or more at their disposal. Upon their withdrawal, under an Order from the Local Government Board, the appointment of a lad messenger was authorised by the Vestry in December, 29 1874, and a Sanitary Labourer, with occasional assistance, has also been engaged in taking the charge of and issuing disinfectants. A second junior clerk has been employed since July, 1881. The permanent Sanitary Staff, therefore, at the present time (exclusive of the Labourer) consists of:— A Superintendent. 3 District Inspectors. An Inspector of Dust. 2 Clerks (paid as juniors). 1 Messenger. The duties of the Superintendent are chiefly those of direction and general supervision, both as regards the Inspectors, the correspondence, legal proceedings, the keeping of all books and records, &c., and in acting as clerk to the Committee. The clerks assist in all office work as far as possible, and the messenger, when not actually engaged as such, also assists in the copying of notices, &c. The Inspector of Dust has always been profitably employed in his own more special work, as already stated. The duties of the three District Inspectors have now to be referred to. The duties will be found in detail in the printed Regulations attached hereto. The most exigent of these duties, such as attending to all complaints received from the inhabitants, and the inspections necessary on account of deaths or sickness from infectious disease, have, of course' the first claim. The complaints have increased from 204 in 1859, and 712 in 1866 (the cholera year), to 2,335 in 1884, and the other inquiries on account of illness, &c., have also been increasing owing to the enormous growth of the population, which, at the lowest estimate, is now 310,000, inhabiting about 40,000 houses, instead of 125,000, with 16,000 houses, as in 1856. The inspection of Cowhouses, Slaughter-houses, and Bakehouses, has also, as a general rule, received prior consideration. So that it is only after these matters have received the attention of the Inspectors 30 that they are able to carry out the duty contained in paragraph 3 of the Regulations, viz., the systematic inspection of houses in the poorer districts of the Parish, and this has, therefore, only been carried out as there was time left from other more urgent work, It is only fair to add that in seasons of extra pressure in other directions, and more particularly in times of epidemic, these inspections have been comparatively few, and in this matter there has been room for considerably increased activity. As regards the extent to which it may be advisable that house to house inspection should be carried out, it does not appear at present to be obligatory upon the Vestry to have every house inspected. It is true that a Bill was not long since introduced into Parliament with a view to making local authorities responsible for the annual inspection of every house in their districts, but the Bill was subsequently dropped. Had this duty been imposed upon the Vestry its efficient performance in Islington would have proved most costly. By the 20th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, however, it is declared (so as to clear up any doubt upon the subject which might have previously existed) that "it shall be the duty of the Nuisance Authority to make from time to time, either by itself or its officers, inspection of the district, with a view to ascertain what nuisances exist, calling for abatement under the powers of the Nuisances Removal Acts, and to enforce the provisions of the said Acts in order to cause the abatement thereof." A discretion as to the extent to which these duties shall be carried out is no doubt left with the Nuisance Authority, and, as a matter of opinion, we believe that it would be in accordance with a fair construction of this statutory obligation, and the necessities of the Parish, if the Vestry now provided for the systematic inspection, annually of about 12,000 houses, irrespective of those visited upon complaint, or in consequence of infectious disease. Of course many out of this number would, owing to Registration, and from other causes, require more frequent visitation. This should not be lost sight of in calculating the work which would have to be done. 31 Upon this basis, which would allow of additional registration, we consider that eight District Inspectors should he employed, each of whom would then, upon an average, have charge of a district containing in round numbers 40,000 inhabitants, and about 5,000 inhabited houses of which, at least 1,500 would require either annual or more frequent inspection. According to our experience, the systematic inspection of 1,500 houses would represent three visits in addition to the primary inspection, so that the annual visits to these 1,500 houses would number 6,000 for each Inspector. But in addition to these 1,500 houses there may bo taken to be 300 complaints, and 200 primary inspections on account of disease from the remaining 3,500 houses in each district. This would together (500 by 4) represent 2,000, additional visits, and the bakehouses, cowhouses, and slaughter-houses, &c., would increase the number by 250 visits for each Inspector per year. The total inspections, therefore, assigned to each Inspector would be 8,250, or an average of 27½ visits per day. The average daily number of inspections now made varies from 20 to 25 visits daily. In this calculation we have not taken into account the extra visits necessary in the case of registered houses, which at present number only 200, nor the time occupied in connection with proceedings at the police-court, nor the purchase of samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, nor the inspection of food exposed for sale, &c. In the Report of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Poor, it is stated that Islington has an Inspector to every 56,000 inhabitants, but the Commission, in making that calculation upon the census population of 1881 (280,000) have obviously included the Superintendent, and also the Inspector of Dust, because each of the three District Inspectors had at the time charge of areas containing an average number of 94,000 inhabitants. As a matter of fact, the average number of inhabitants to each of the three districts has varied from year to year, commencing with 63,000 in 1867, and reaching 100,000 in 1884, the work having been carried 32 out without the employment of extra assistance in the interval between these years. The suggestion, however, which we now make is that the average number of inhabitants in each district in future should not exceed 40,000, and we would add that in times of pressure extra help should be freely accorded. The mode in which it may be deemed desirable to re-arrange and adjust the districts and duties of the Inspectors is a matter for afterconsideration ; but the permanent increase in the present staff of throe District Inspectors to eight would, in our opinion, necessitate the employment of one thoroughly efficient clerk and two additional juniors. We are, Gentlemen, Your obedient servants, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, Medical Officer of Health. HENRY I. COLLINGWOOD, Superintendent. Sanitary Department, 16th November, 18S5. 33 VESTRY OF ST.

Sanitary Department, Revised 31st March, 1885. 35 SECOND REPORT, THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. TO THE SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, In accordance with your further directions on the 16th November, 1885, we beg to report as follows :— 1st. As regards the salaries of the Inspectors. In each case an Inspector's salary commences with the minimum of 30s. per week, and rises by annual increments of 2s. per week to a maximum of 40s. This salary is in accordance with a scale fixed by the Vestry twenty-one years ago (March, 1864), when two inspectors only were employed in sanitary work. The following statement shows the dates of the appointments of the four permanent Inspectors of Nuisances, and also the dates when they attained the maximum salaries of 40s they attained the maximum salaries of 40s. The Junior Inspector (Mr. Wilson) has, it will be seen, served the parish ten years, and the Senior Inspector (Mr. Pain) fourteen and a half years. Dite of Appointment. Attained Maximum. Mr. James B. Pain 30th May, 1871 40s., 1877 Mr. George West 6th February, 1874 ... 40s., 1879 Mr. Jas. J. Jordan 4th January, 1875 40s., 1880 Mr. Chas. T. Wilson 26th November, 1875 40s., 1881 Taking into consideration the salaries paid elsewhere, and the more recent appointments in adjoining parishes, we arc of opinion that no new Inspectors should be appointed at a salary less than £2 per week, rising by five or ten annual instalments to a maximum of £3 per week. If this suggestion be adopted, an addition of 10s. per week should, it appears to us, be made in the salary of each of the four permanent Inspectors, and another 10s. in two annual instalments of 5s. per week, unless it shall be thought more equitable that these Inspectors, being 36 thoroughly efficient from their long experience, should immediately receive the maximum of £3 per week. The two clerks and messenger described below were also appointed at salaries in accordance with scales fixed for Junior Clerks in 1864> and for Messengers in December, 1874. The particulars given show the dates of their appointments and the past and present position of each in respect to salary, and we are of opinion that some improvement might fairly be made in their position by increasing their salaries or by promoting them as occasion may arise.

The salary of the Superintendent is not regulated by scale, and since June, 1880, he has been receiving £4 per week. He has also an additional £50 a year for acting as Clerk to the Dusting and Slopping Committee. 2nd. We have also carefully and fully considered, in every detail, the advantages and disadvantages, in connection with the alternative schemes, of dividing the Parish into eight Districts, with an Inspector to each, or into four districts, with one Inspector and an Assistant Inspector to each District; and we are of opinion that the larger number of Districts with smaller areas and undivided responsibility is by far the more desirable plan for your adoption. We are, Gentlemen, Your obedient servants, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, Medical Officer of Health. HENRY I. COLLING WOOD, Superintendent. Sanitary Department, 1st December, 1885. 37 Tho first recommendation contained in the Committee's Report, as to the appointment of four additional Inspectors, was adopted, except that the old scale of salary was adhered to. The other recommendations having been referred back to tho Committee, No. 7 was withdrawn and Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and G were modified and re-submitted to tho Yestry in the following terms, and as a matter of fact they wore all carried, except that No. 5 was declared to be lost upon the ground of its not being supported by a majority of two-thirds of the 42 members present, whereas by the 57th Section of the Act 18 and 19 Vic., Cap. 120, a mere majority only was required, the number of members then present (42) being greater by one-fifth than the number present (34) on the 14th March, 1864, when the scale of salaries was fixed. The Vestry have not since, however, arrived at any decision upon the point thus raised, although they will no doubt do so as soon as the matter is brought fully before them. 2. That the junior Clerk, George H. King, be appointed clerk in the office of the department at a commencing salary of £50 per annum, with an annual increase according to scale. 3. That the Messenger, Frederick William S a fiery, be appointed clerk in the office of the department at a commencing salary of £40 per annum, with an annual increase according to scale. 4. That the Committee be authorised to appoint a junior clerk, at 10s. per week, with an annual increase according to scale; and also a messenger upon the usual terms of 8s. per week and uniform, with an annual increase according to scale. 5. That the salaries of the four permanent inspectors, Messrs. James Burney Pain, George West, James Jarvis Jordan, and Charles Turle Wilson, be increased in consideration of their long service, from 40s. to 45s. per week. G. That the salary of the clerk, Mr. Alfred Canter, be increased from 20s. to 25s. per week. 7, (Withdrawn.) 38 THE DUSTING OF THE PARISH, 1885—86. I have appended, as usual, a tabulated Statement (Table No. VII.) of the applications for the removal of Dust during the year ending Lady-Day, 1886, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the Parish. Of the total number of 11,194 applications received from residents during the year 7,776 were by letter or postal card, and 3,418 were made personally, or by messengers sent to the Vestry Offices. The 11,194 applications received from inhabitants were at the rate of 27'9 per cent, of the 40,038 assessments in the Parish. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C.
