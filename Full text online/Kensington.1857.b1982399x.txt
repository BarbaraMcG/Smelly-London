KEN 84 SECOND ANIMAL REPORT OP THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH (EXTRACT FROM THE VESTRY REPORT FOR MARCH, 1857 - MARCH, 1858 ) 1 17 work is scarce and provisions are high, become a burthen upon our rates and swell our Bills of Mortality. To remedy some of these evils, Kensington has nobly taken the initiative in endeavouring to procure an equal assessment and rating of all the parishes comprising the metropolitan area, under Sir Benjamin Hall's Local Management Act. This will at once put an end to the measures taken by parishes to eject forcibly from his work and home every poor man who may require, perhaps, only temporary relief, and will enable the labourer to select his own residence, irrespective of which is and which is not his parish. It will also obviate the argument frequently used, that by improving your poor man's dwelling in Kensington, you hold out an inducement to others to make this place their home, and thus, eventually, to become chargeable to the parish. One of the most deplorable spots, not only in Kensington, but in the whole metropolis, is the Potteries, at Notting Dale, a locality which is from its position, difficult to drain. It occupies eight or nine acres of ground, and contains about 1,000 inhabitants, the majority of whom obtain a living by rearing and fattening pigs, upon the house refuse obtained from club houses and hotels, and upon offal, entrails, liver, and blood, from slaughter houses. This offensive food, often in a high state of decomposition when brought to the place, is boiled down in coppers, and the fat separated for sale. The number of pigs varies from 1 to 2,000 (as many as 3,000 have been kept) in filthy and badly paved styes, close to the houses. The drainage, in nearly all cases very defective, permits the liquid manure to run over the yards, saturating the ground to a great depth, contaminating all the wells with putrid matter, and polluting the atmosphere for a considerable distance around. There were, till lately, several immense accumulations of stagnant water into which this pig matter found its way. One immense piece called '' the Ocean,'' formerly occupied nearly an acre of ground—it was covered with filthy slime, and bubbling with poisonous gases, caused by the drainage of pig-styes and privies flowing into it. Till lately the want of water was most severely felt by the inhabitants ; and even now many of the yards in which the pigs are kept, are entirely destitute of it. Many of the houses are in a most dilapidated state. Old railway carriages and worn out travelling vans may be seen taken off their wheels and converted into dwellings. The people in general look sallow and aged, the children pale and flabby, their eyes glistening as if stimulated by ammonia. Small pox 18 is ten times more fatal in this spot than in any of the surrounding districts. The General Death-rate varies from 40 to 60 per 1000, per annum ; of these deaths the very large proportion of 87.5 per cent., are under five years of age, and nearly all the deaths, I again observe, occur from Zymotic diseases: the most appalling fact, however, connected with this subject and one most likely to make a deep sensation in the public mind, is that for a period of three years, the average age at death is under twelve years. Surely with such a melancholy fact as this before us, no one will say that anything short of the entire removal of the animals will cure the gigantic evil. DRAINAGE. The question of Drainage is of vast importance to the health of the community, and we may congratulate ourselves on the excellent sewerage we possess in the parish. Very few of our localities are without sewers, and the natural elevation of different parts of our district, combined with the good inclination there is to the river, must give us a great advantage over many other metropolitan parishes. The object of good and efficient sewerage is, first to remove decomposing matter held in suspension, and secondly to carry off surplus water :—ibut it must be borne in mind that unless this be properly carried out, the evil intended to be abated may be increased by extending the evaporating surface of decomposing matter, and by shifting, it from one place to another, saturating our atmosphere with organic poison. It thus becomes the duty of your medical officer to draw your attention to this subject. The effect of gases in a concentrated form (as when pent up in sewers), we all know, is to produce instant death to any one subject to their influence: and without doubt, as surely, but more slowly, do such emanations however diluted, tend to swell the Bills of Mortality: and it is a well ascertained fact that Fevers, Cholera, and Diarrhæa, decimate those neighbourhoods which are most imperfectly drained. Although, since my appointment, large numbers of cesspools have been filled, blocks of houses been efficiently drained, and good closets erected in place of most offensive open privies, much still requires to be done; as it is no easy matter to discover those houses which have cesspools attached to them, unless complaint be first made. 19 I trust to see, ere long, every cesspool in this parish abolished, as otherwise from the nature of the subsoil our wells are certain to become contaminated by their contents; and I would especially urge that all drains should be constructed of the most impermeable material. Your surveyor informs me that he intends to present to your Board a Report on the sewerage of the Parish; I forbear therefore from entering more fully into the subject, only strongly recommending that all places at present imperfectly, or not at all provided therewith, should be immediately furnished with that great requisite of health—Drainage. WATER SUPPLY. There is scarcely any circumstance possessing more influence on the health of a locality, than the quality of the "Water Supply; and from a conviction, of this, the subject has engaged a large amount of my attention. "Water in a state of absolute purity, can only be procured by melting Wenham Lake or some such ice, or by freezing ordinary water, with certain precautions, to prevent any mechanical retention of impurities contained in it previous to congelation; for it is a remarkable fact that during freezing, water has the property of getting rid of every substance, poisonous or otherwise, foreign to it. The ordinary constituents of chalk waters, of which the Thames must be taken as our example, are lime, magnesia, soda, potash, silicia, iron, alumina, sulphuric acid, and chlorine. The ordinary proportion of chlorine in these waters, previous to contamination, is less than a grain in the gallon, and of magnesia less than half-a-grain; but sewage matter and manure contain a considerable quantity of chlorine and magnesian compounds, consequently an increase in quantity of these substances over the proportions just mentioned would serve as an index to the amount of such dangerous introductions. Again, in pure chalk waters, the amount of sulphuric acid is seldom great, while nitric and ammonia are absent. "When sewage and other matters undergoing putrefaction find their way into a river otherwise pure, chemical changes commence, which have a teadency to destroy those poisonous bodies; thus we find, the offensive compoimds of sulphur with hydrogen,—as sulphuretted hydrogen, decomposed by the oxygen in the water, and in the air in contact with it, producing sulphuric acid and water, whilst the ammonia undergoes a somewhat similar change, leading to the formation of nitric acid. 20 It will therefore be understood, that under favorable circumstances, it is possible to have putrifying contaminations so destroyed by their conversion into these acids, as to become almost harmless; but then it must be remembered that during the seasons of the year when putrefaction advances most rapidly, this purifying change is frequently entirely stopped ; for the process of purification is one of oxydation, and we could no more expect a fire in the grate to bum, with the sun shining full upon it, than the destruction of these dangerous compounds by oxydation, in full daylight. After these observations I need scarcely observe, that in order to ascertain the fitness of any water used in any particular district, a complete analysis is necessary. The mere estimation of the amount of the solid contents with the organic matter, does not give the information required; it does not show whether that organic matter is of animal or vegetable origin, neither does it show whether the water sewage and drainage matters are injurious to health; but when, by a complete analysis, we find an increase of sulphuric acid, of chlorine, of magnesia, of phosphate, and nitric acid, it shews that such a water, does receive dangerous contamination; and if from any meteorological condition of the atmosphere, the purifying oxydation is put a stop to, such waters may at some time or other become active in the production of disease. I would also observe, that by this complete mode of investigation, the nature of the organic matter, that is, whether of animal or vegetable origin, can be correctly ascertained—for if we have organic matter without increase of magnesia, and chlorine joined with the absence of nitric acid, we are justified in the conclusion that such organic matter is of vegetable origin; while, with nitric acid and an increased quantity of chlorine and magnesia, the conclusion that it is of animal origin is equally justifiable. From these considerations, notwithstanding the labour of such investigations, I have subjected nine of the waters constituting the great sources of supply (and obtained from distant parts of the parish) to a minute and careful analysis. The waters analysed are from The Chelsea water works, specimen taken from stand pipe, Pelham Crescent. The Grand Junction water works, specimen taken from stand pipe, in the "Oxbridge Road. The "West Middlesex water works, specimen taken from stand pipe, near Kensington Turnpike. The Public Pump, in High-street, Notting Hill. 21 The Parish Pump, near Kensington Church. The Deep Well, Chelsea Grove, Brompton. The Superficial Well, Chelsea Grove, Brompton. The Artesian Well, Kensington Workhouse. The Public Pump, in the Potteries. The first table represents the ingredients of these waters, as actually determined in the progress of the analyses, and in the second as they are believed to exist, combined in the waters. A careful perusal of the analyses of the Thames' waters will shew, that although the river receives the sewage from towns containing about half-a-million of inhabitants above the source of supply; such is the enormous bulk of water flowing, that while we may regret that our great supply of water is drawn from a source at all subject to such contaminations, it must be admitted, that (with the excellent arrangements adopted by the several water companies), the effect is almost inappreciable. The amount of organic matter is about the same as is found naturally in the Thames, above tidal influence; and although somewhat greater than that given in the recent report to the General Board of Health, it is, in all probability, neither injurious in quantity nor in character. Experience has shewn that all superficial wells in populated neighbourhoods, are generally unfit for potable purposes, in consequence of the amount of contamination through which the water percolates. The pump at Chelsea Grove may be instanced as an example,—here we have the immense amount of 103.45 grains of solid matter in a single gallon, of which 16.59 is either organic matter capable of entering into an active state of decomposition, or the result of previous change. We have also so large an amount of magnesia and lime salts as would alone render it, not only unfit for drinking, but useless for every other purpose, except flushing. The deep well in the same locality must be regarded as a boon to the inhabitants. The water is one well adapted for washing and cleansing, being but of a few degrees of hardness, and similar in character to that drawn from the artesian well at the workhouse. The water from the pump in the Potteries is of the same kind ; but unfortunately, contaminated by some drainage, so as to render it in its present condition, unsuitable for drinking purposes. The water of the pump, at Notting Hill, differs from the others in this respect, that it is extremely hard before boiling, but afterwards, becomes soft. 22 I must here congratulate the parish upon the possession of so admirable a water as that drawn from the artesian well: it must be considered as a perfect uncontamiuated sample of soft water, possessing all those excellent qualities so much required where cleanliness is of paramount value for the preservation of health among so large a number of persons as is necessarily collected together in a workhouse. It is a water that not only diminishes labour in washing, but requires, comparatively, so small an amount of soap as must necessarily occasion an annual saving in the cost of that material. That quality of water which is designated hardness, is principally dependent on the presence of lime and magnesia salts, which may be considered as of two kinds; those which are deposited during ebullition, and those which cannot be separated by any amount of boiling. The waters of the Thames are hard previous to boiling, but lose the quarter amount, after ebullition. The waters of the artesian well and Chelsea Grove deep well, are previous to boiling, of about the same hardness as Thames water when boiled; but this is almost entirely lost after boiling. The waters of the superficial wells are extremely hard, both before and after boiling. Before leaving this part of my subject, I consider it my duty to urge most strenuously, upon all parishioners, the great necessity of care being exercised in the preservation of the water used for drinking purposes. All wooden buts and tubs should be removed, on account of the great liability to decomposition, and well covered slate or stone cisterns should be substituted. These should be examined and thoroughly cleaned out several times in the year. Special attention should however be paid to the mode of cleaning leaden cisterns, lest by removing the crust from the sides, the bright surface, of the metal should be exposed, thus rendering the water liable to be contaminated with salts of lead. A want of due precaution in this respect has been known to produce diseases, which eventually, have been found to have resulted from the presence of carbonate of lead in the drinking water. I have examined, during the past year, immense numbers of water receptacles, in the houses of the rich as well as the poor, and find them alike, neglected and dirty. A microscopic examination of the waters from these sources, after being allowed to stand for a short time, shews the presence of trifusorial animalcules, and numerous low forms of vegetable growth, belonging to the orders, diatomacese and confervæ. 23 Those butts which are uncovered, are liable to subsoil noxious gases from the atmosphere, and to have their water contaminated by both vegetable and animal substances, which may have fallen or been thrown in. Cats, rats, and birds, in a state of decomposition, have sometimes been found. I cannot conclude my Report, gentlemen, without offering you my best thanks, for the cordial manner in which you have supported me in the execution of my duties; many of them of an invidious character; and others involving considerable outlay to the owners of property. My thanks are also due to all the Officers of your Parish, for the valuable assistance they have at all times been willing to accord me; and especially to Mr Cornell, for his gratuitously permitting an examination of the mortality returns at any time. I have endeavoured to lay before you a correct statement cif the Sanitary condition of your Parish, rather than a detailed account of the operations of the past year, which may be reserved for another opportunity. The Statistics have been collected with much care and trouble; they have not been over coloured, but represent the actual state of our Public Health. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, F. GODRICH, Medical Officer of Health. 1 Meteorological Table, for Kensington and South Western Suburbs, calculated from 100,000 Observations, Mean Temperature for 20 years for the above District January Feb.

TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF ST. MARY ABBOTT'S, KENSINGTON, IN THE COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX. Gentlemen, But few preliminary remarks are required in presenting to yon my Second Annual Report. The 109th clause of the Metropolis Local Management Act, requires that the reports presented during the year by the Medical Officer of Health, should be printed and circulated with the General Statement relating to the Vestry, and I have received instructions from the Sewers and Sanitary Committee to lay before you an abstract of the mortality of the past year, with an account of the proceedings taken for the removal or abatement of Nuisances, and for the improvement of the Sanitary condition of the Parish generally. I shall pursue this year the plan I adopted in my first Annual Report, of closing the mortality accounts on the 31st December, as this will prevent any inconvenience arising from a want of relation between my own tables and those of the Registrar General. By adopting this plan I am also following the example of other Health Officers. It is a matter for sincere congratulation that we have completed the year without being visited by any serious epidemic, and also that the rate of mortality has been absolutely lower than in any of the four preceding years. The past may therefore well be termed a healthy year, as far as our own Parish is concerned. According to my calculations, based on the known decenial increase of our population, I estimate the total number of persons living in the Parish to be 56.000. Another proof that this estimate is pretty correct may be formed from our rate books, which show that there are 9000 inhabited houses ; and as we know that in our Parish seven persons inhabit each house, as an average, the number above stated is sufficiently accurate for all purposes of comparison. The total number of deaths registered, during the year, was 1197; of this number 114 occurred in the Consumption Hospital, all except 5 were strangers availing themselves of the benefit of the charity; 5 deaths were registered from the Cancer Hospital—all nonparishioners. By substracting therefore the large number of 114, the mortility of our parish will be at the rate of 19.3 per 1000 per annum. The rate of mortality in the whole Metropolis, for the same 28 period, was 22.5 per 1000; and as the Registrar General gives it his opinion that a death rate of 17 per 1000 may be attained in any moderately healthy locality, it follows that 131 persons died who might, but for some local influences, as overcrowding, filth, &c. have been saved. The following table will shew the number of deaths from the various Epidemic or Zymotic diseases, arranged in the various quarters, and compared with the deaths from the same diseases in 1856. Diseased Inspiratory Organs. Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. H. Cough Diar. Fever. Total. 134 1857 1qr. 0 11 10 22 4 4 51 97 ... 2 qr. 0 4 5 10. 3 0 21 75 ... 3 qr. 0 0 6 1 71 8 86 136 ... 4 qr. 0 0 6 4 6 5 22 412 Total 0 15 26 37 83 20 180 447 Total 1856 13 30 20 19 62 15 159 You will notice that the mortality from Small Pox has been reduced, from 13 to 0—from Measles from 30 to 15—whereas the death-rate from Hooping Cough has been nearly doubled, and from Diarrhæa much increased:* * This extra mortality from Diarrhæa, is I believe, mainly owing to the peculiar meteorological phenomena of the year, which are, "The high temperature and the slowness of the winds movements. The temperature was 2° above the average of the preceeding 17 years, the wind, instead of moving at the average rate of 110 miles a day, passed over London at the rate of 81 miles."—Report of Registrar General. The per centage of deaths from this class to those from all causes is 15-04, and from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, the per centage 36-9, excluding the mortality of non parishioners in the Consumption Hospital, the percentage becomes 27.4, whereas the average of all 29 London is but 18.1. The large excess of deaths I believe, is owing to the migration of a great number of persons suffering from these diseases, who resort to this neighbourhood on account of its known salubrity. Of deaths at different periods of life, under 1 year of age, 244 died—between 1 and 2, 85—2 and 5, 109. 438 children therefore perished under 5 years of age; that is to say, 36-5 per cent of the total number of deaths. This number, though apparently excessively high, is about 10 per cent. lower than the mortality in the whole Metropolis. Although so many infants have perished, a great increase to the population has taken place, by the birth of 1828 children, which will give to the parish a gain of 745 over the total number of deaths. . I have introduced a table shewing the mortality which has taken place according to the various occupations; this will prove I think of much value, as shewing the effects of certain occupations upon the health of persons so employed, but I regret that at present I am unable to furnish you with the total number of persons carrying on the various trades and professions in our Parish, as when the census was last taken, our District was united with Paddington and Fulham. Although the general mortality for the past year has been at the ratio of about 19 per 100, we shall find that this ratio differs materially in difierent localities. No. of Ihabits.

The average mortality per 1000 for the previous year was 36-5, whereas for the past year it is only 27-5. 30 The mortality in the Potteries is likewise reduced from an average of Upwards of 40 per 100, to 31-8. Mr. Lovett, the Inspector, has furnished me with an account of all nuisances which have been dealt with during the year, dust removal not being included. I much regret that it has not been considered practicable to provide certain localities with proper Sewerage, especially the District of Earls' Court and Devonshire Terrace; places from which numerous complaints are being received. Insuperable objections have also sprung up against erecting public conveniences in some of our thoroughfares, on account of the nuisance they might prove to those living near. The food supplied has appeared to me to have been of a superior quality than that sold a year or two ago. The Slaughter Houses have been from time to time examined by the Inspector and myself. Forty-seven Applications were received for the License of SlaughterHouses; certain alterations, particularly with regard to ventilation were ordered to be carried out, and only in two cases was the license opposed, as no properly constructed Slaughter-House existed on the premises. The Cow-Sheds have likewise been from time to time visited principally to cause the more frequent removal of manure and refuse from the premises' during the hot weather. We must also regret, that up to the present time, our efforts to improve the health of the Inhabitants of the Potteries, have proved abortive. The occupation of Pig Feeding and Boiling is still carried on with impunity—Scientific Evidence adduced in our Courts of Law, clearly shew the amount of the evil, and the steps necessary to be taken to abate it, but from an alleged imformality in the order made by the presiding Magistrate at the Police Court, and from a protective clause in the "Nuisance Removal Act," we have not been able satisfactorily to carry out any Sanitary measures. The subject however has not been lost sight of, and it will again be brought under the notice of the Sewers and Sanitary Committee. Numbers of houses during the past year have been placed in a much better Sanitary condition. The following is the list of works reported upon to the Committee, and carried out under the superintendence of myself and the Inspector. 31 PROCEEDINGS UNDER NUISANCE REMOVAL ACT.

Inspector. In addition to these, some hundreds of manure heaps and other nuisances have been removed, and many rooms and houses have been cleansed and whitewashed without the necessity of issuing any notice, as the necessary works were performed after representing the matter to the owner, either personally or by letter; they were consequently not entered in the report book, as no legal measures were required to be taken. Of the 51 cases in which Summonses were obliged to be taken out at the Police Court, 3 were withdrawn, as the ownership of the premises was doubtful. In one case a man was imprisoned for 3 weeks for selling food unfit for human consumption; in another, was fined £5 for slaughtering without license. In ten cases the works were performed after the Summonses had been taken out, but before hearing; and in all the rest, the necessary works have been satisfactorily carried out. The total number of houses examined has been over 2,000, and many of these had to be visited several times. 32 You will notice, that but little has been done to improve the ventilation of dwellings, but it is without doubt all important, that persons occupying in hundreds of instances but one room both for living and sleeping, should have every facility afforded them for proper ventilation. Thorough ventilation cannot in many cases be possible, on account of houses abutting on each other, and on account of the property immediately adjoining belonging to different owners, still we may effect numerous improvements by causing the top sashes to be made to open, by introducing valves, or perforated zinc plates, &c., for ventilation has reference more particularly to the facilities of changing the renewing air, as often as it becomes charged with unwholesome and poisonous matter. In Workhouses, Barracks, &c., about 500 cubic feet of air is calculated for each individual, whereas in many of our Courts the amount varies from 160 to 200 c. f. I forbear at present dwelling upon the great necessity there exists of improving the moral and social condition of the poor, and of providing Baths and Wash-houses; though I believe that the cause of various Epidemic Diseases spontaneously appearing in the dwellings of the better classes, may at times be traced to the fact, that the Laundress resides in some locality in which these diseases are rife, when we can easily understand that the washing may become impregnated with the material of the disease, especially when dried, &., in their own close confined rooms. From our proximity to the Serpentine, many of our poor bathe during the season, in what we may term that vast cesspool; the necessity of this would be somewhat remedied, by establishing Public Baths, supposing the price of admission could be sufficiently reduced. I am not in a position to speak of the pernicious influence of these emanations from the Thames, but I think efficient measures should be adopted for the proper ventilation of the Main Sewers; so long as openings exist in our roads, so surely must certain offensive effluvia arise from decomposing refuse matter passing along, be diffused in the atmosphere, and tend to produce disease in any habitations situated near them, and as these openings must to a certain extent always exist, until some better plan be devised, so long must the public health suffer. The difficulty does not appear to me to be very great, if high shafts were erected, or tall chimneys taken advantage of, the offensive gases might easily be made to pass through them, when by the well-known law of diffusion of gases, the emanations would be so diluted, that little or no injury would take place. A better plan than this would be, to first pass these gases through the furnace, when no injury to health could occur.
