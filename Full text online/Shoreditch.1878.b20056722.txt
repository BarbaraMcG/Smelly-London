VESTRY OF THE Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, MIDDLESEX. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT, 1855. TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT, FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH 25th, 1879. PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 18 & 19 VIC., CAP. 120. LONDON: A. T. Roberts, Son & Co., Steam Printers, 5, Hackney Road. 1879. A REPORT On the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., and of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year ending Lady-day, 1879. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Management Acts." REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1879, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £61,242 5s. 2d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four quarters was 2s. 6d., being for the quarter to Midsummer, 8d.; to Michaelmas, 8d.; to Christmas, 7d.; and to Lady-day, 7d. During the previous year the Poor Rate was 2s. 8d. The amount of the Guardians' Calls for the year ending Lady-day, 1878, was £51,000; and for the last year £50,000; and for the half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1879, is £20,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1878, was nil, and the same satisfactory result was attained at the end of the last year. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rate will be found in the Balance Sheet given with the Accountant's Report. 6 SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The Accountant's statement hereto appended will give the details of the receipts and expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the ratee levied for the last two years were— 1878. 1879. General in the £ 1/9 2/- Sewers ditto 6d. 6d. 2/3 2/6 The total amount collected on the Vestry rates for the year was £60,569 9s. 10d., an increase from the previous year of £10,830. Of these large sums collected by the Vestry—£61,242 on Poor rate, and £60,569 Vestry rates, large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposes over which the Vestry has no control. Thus, in addition to the £50,000 paid to the Guardians, out of which the County Rates and Metropolitan Asylum Board's charges are paid, there is the sum of £10,365 paid to the Commissioners of Police, equal to an actual rate on the parish of 5d. in the £; also £212 to the Returning Officer for Borough Registration expenses. From the Sewers rate is paid the Metropolitan Board's Consolidated rate of £9,783, or equal to a rate of nearly 5d. From the General rate is paid the School Board rate of £10,680, or equal to 5¼d. in the pound. All these charges are based upon the rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses or for the allowance to owners. It will therefore be seen that where from local circumstances a considerable portion of property is unoccupied the burden of taxation falls unequally upon the remaining portion, but possibly a remedy for this unequality is not to be easily devised. 7 ASSESSMENTS. The Valuation List for the previous year amounted to £624,370 Gross value, £503,715 Rateable value. For the present year the amount is fixed at Gross value, £641,204; Rateable value, £517,897; being an increase of £16,834 and £14,182 respectively. Only one appeal from the decision of the Assessment Committee was taken to the General Assessment Sessions. It was by the London and North Western Railway Company, against Messrs. Castle and Sons' valuation of the new warehouse in Eldon Street, which was fixed at £7,590 rateable value. The appeal was dismissed with costs against the Company. COLLECTION OF RATES. The improved collection of the Rates still continues. It will be seen by the Accountant's tables that on the whole year's rates, the last being made in December, 1878, there was on the 25th of March onty £112 17s. 1d. supposed to be recoverable, but unrecovered, and of this sum some portion has since been obtained. The amount of excused and loss from empties is a trifle higher this year than last, but this is easily to be accounted for by the prevailing commercial depression, and by the large number of premises but newly built, or from other causes, unoccupied, and mainly so from the extensive Metropolitan Improvements. Upon the whole this phase of the Vestry's financial condition may be regarded as satisfactory. PERMANENT DEBT. The last of the Debenture Bonds, given for money borrowed for paving purposes by the old Paving Board, were redeemed this year. They were given in 1827 for £500 each. The Vestry has now no permanent debt but such as it has itself incurred since 1856 for Paving, Sewerage, Town Hall, and Improvement purposes, full particulars of which are given iu subsequent table. 8 RAILWAYS, TRAMWAYS, &c. The only proposal of this character made to Parliament last Session affecting this parish was a Bill by the Great Eastern Railway Company, for (inter alia) powers to widen the low level station at Bishopsgate. It presented no features to which the Vestry had any objection. The Tramway Extensions authorised, by the Act of 1877, the New North Road line to Canonbury, and the High Street, Shoreditch, have been constructed. The Vestry received for the use of the paving already provided in these streets the sum of £2,400. Of this amount £1,000 was expended in redeeming the bonds as before mentioned, and the remaining amount has been decided to be applied to the repaying of Hoxton Street. P.S.—It may be observed that the Act authorising the Shoreditch extension required the consent of the Metropolitan Board to the line passing south of Bethnal Green Road. In the month of July the Company applied for and obtained the necessary consent with the approval of the Yestry, and the line is now in course of construction. A further sum of about £800 will be recoverable for the use of the pavement of this section. NEW STREET: SUN STREET TO WORSHIP STREET, This street has now been completed and opened. The Vestry has contributed the sum of £55,000 towards the cost of this improvement, which sum was advanced by the Metropolitan Board, repayable by annual instalments over a period of fifty years, at £3 15s. per cent., a further call for £15,000 was made, but this being objected to by the Vestry, as excessive, has been reduced to £10,000; the necessary preliminaries for its advance and re-payment are not yet completed. The total cost of the work has not yet been ascertained, and a very small amount has been as yet received by 9 way of recoupment. The times are not favorable for letting, and some time may elapse before any reduction of the charges on the Vestry from that source is obtained. PUBLIC MEASURES. Several Bills were introduced into Parliament more or less affecting Local Government. The Valuation Bill which was ultimately withdrawn; the District Auditors' Act imposing a stamp duty upon the District Auditors' Certificate towards the payment of his salary; the Sale of Food Act Amendment Bill to remove certain doubts and simplify proceedings; an Act to remove a legal difficulty respecting the qualification of holders of small tenements for the Parliamentary franchise; the Artizans and Laborers Dwellings Act, 1868 extension to give greater powers to the Local Authorities, the former Act being practically a dead letter, and an Act to give greater scope to the Metropolitan Board in disposing of sites cleared under the Artizans Dwellings Act, 1875, are among the most important affecting local government. HARWAR STREET IMPROVEMENT. The arrangements between the Vestry, the Drapers' Company, and the Charity Commissioners, for the removal of Harwar's Almshouses, in Kingsland Road, and the completing the thoroughfare through Harwar Street, late Thomas Street, have progressed somewhat slowly owing to some difference between the Company and the Commissioners. These have now been settled and the order will shortly be issued.* The scheme to be sanctioned will be the conversion of the benefits of the Almshouses into twelve pensions,—six men, married or single, and six women, single or widows, of £30 per year each. The present inmates will receive £35 15s. per year. One half of the *Sealed and issued on the 12th of August. 10 pensions will be appointed on the recommendation of the Charity Trustees of this parish, the other half will be appointed by the Drapers' Company. So much of the present site as is not required for improvement purposes will be let by the Company on building lease, and the rent obtainable will be applied to the Pension Fund. To make up the Pension Fund to £240 per year the Vestry is to pay into Consols such a sum as will afford dividends which, when added to the rent obtainable, will provide that sum of £240; but at first the sum of £3,000 is to be invested to await the final adjustment after the property has been let. It is estimated that the total cost of widening and paving the widened portions of the thoroughfares will be £3,000, but that will depend upon the amount of rent that will be obtained. The Metropolitan Board has agreed to contribute one-half, such contribution not to exceed £2,000. NEW WORKS. The Vestry applied for and obtained a loan of £12,000 from the Metropolitan Board for carriageway paving purposes, and towards effecting the Harwar Street Improvement. It was taken up for fifteen years, in two instalments of £6,000 each, on the 1st of April, and the 1st of July, at £3 15s. It was based upon the following estimate— St. John's Road, Carriageway (new) 4470 0 0 Provost Street 2105 5 6 Harwar Street (exclusive of Improvement) 2300 0 0 Scrutton Street 900 0 0 Relay of Old Stone 865 0 0 £10,646 5 6 The stale of the Vestry's indebtedness in respect to loans will be seen on reference to the table in this report. 11 METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS. The last of the Improvements effected by the Metropolitan Board under the Act of 1872, in this neighbourhood—the Bethnal Green Road was completed and opened early in the present year. A portion of this is situate in the Parish of Shoreditch. The works were much delayed by the bad weather. The carrying out of this work necessitated the removal of a large public convenience situated in Sclater Street. The Vestry asked the Board to replace it by another on a convenient spot, and ultimately consented to the erection of such a place in the High Street, near the end of Great Eastern Street. A large double structure of Jennings' patent is now being erected by the Metropolitan Board at a cost of about £500. REFUGES, CROSSINGS, &c. The Secretary of State appears to have had his attention called to the number of street accidents occurring in London, many of which would be preventable by more care on the part of both drivers and pedestrians, and he has applied for information as to the number of refuges in the parish, and suggested that one should be placed at the end of Bethnal Green Road. This suggestion had been anticipated and the order given. The following information was furnished, and the parts indicated on the parish plan. Ordinary refuges 8 Urinal refuges in streets 3 Refuges in course of construction 2 The number does not seem large but it must be remembered that it is only in wide openings that they can be placed, and in the parish of Shoreditch these are comparatively few. A lamentable accident occurred during the winter in the New North Road, by which two children were killed by being run over by a tramcar. Although it does not appear that the sharp corner 12 of Mintern Street, which the tramcars have to pass, had any direct bearing on the accident, yet it was considered that the spot was dangerous, and negociations were set on foot to effect the rounding and setting back of the chapel fence. These steps seem likely to be attended with some result.* RED LION STONE YARD. Since the year 1851 the Vestry had used a plot of ground in Hoxton Street, as a stone yard. It was a piece of ground enclosed by the Vestry, and in respect of which no claim was seriously made for a period of 27 years. At length claimants came forward in the form of Trustees under a marriage settlement, and it being found that the claim if not absolutely sound, was based upon an honest case, and that time had not run against the claimants, a verdict in their favor was consented to, their paying all costs, the Vestry has agreed to rent this land for three years at £60 per year. OPEN SPACE, OLD STREET. The Improvement Committee has had under consideration the provision of a suitable column and drinking fountain upon the open space between Great Eastern Street and Old Street, but they have not yet presented a final report. PUBLIC LIGHTING. A special report upon the subject of Public Lighting, under the Average Meter System, for the first year of its adoption in this parish, is appended to this report, in which full informtion upon the subject will be found. GAS WORKS NUISANCE. Complaints were made in the month of June of a renewal of the nuisance caused by the removal of the foul lime from the *The terms have now been agreed upon. The cost of the Improvement will be about £150; the Tramway Company will contribute £50. 13 purifiers at the Gas Works, in Great Cambridge Street, and after investigation the following report was presented to the Vestry. No definite action was taken by the Vestry, but some further precautions were taken by the Company's Officers and the complaints have not since been seriously renewed. Vestry of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch. THE GAS NUISANCE IN HAGGERSTON. Gentlemen, The complaint of the inhabitants made recently to the Vestry as to the nuisance caused at the Haggerston Works, having been referred to myself and the Medical Officer, I have to report as follows. The Medical Officer and myself reported upon this matter in October, 1876, and stated the cause and nature of the nuisance at that time. Since then we know that the Company's officers, have made every effort to avoid it, and from the fact that no serious complaints had reached us until the one made to the Vestry a few days ago, we had hoped they had succeeded; but if it be true as alleged that the nuisance frequently occurs, it would seem that other and more stringent steps than remonstrance for its suppression must be adopted. The cause of the nuisance is the removal from the Works of the foul lime used in purifying the gas. The use of this lime is rendered necessary from the fact, that the Gas Referees have prescribed a degree of purity from sulphur which cannot be obtained by any other known process; and also, that if this purity is not kept up, the Company must be mulct in heavy penalties which there is no power to mitigate. The Company admitted their inability to make gas with a maximum of 25 grains of sulphur per 100 cubic feet without using lime, and that its use and removal would always constitute more or less a nuisance. They alleged this to the Gas Referees and to Parliament. They asked the Referees to relax this rule, and failing to obtain relief, applied to Parliament for a Bill with the same object. The Referees replied that the complaints were exaggerated, and that by care and improved process the nuisance could be largely abated, but some smell must always be expected from Gas Works. The Corporation of London and the Metropolitan Board opposed the Bill in the Committee of the House of Commons, allegingthat the 14 extra 10 or 15 grains which the Company asked to be allowed as the standard of purity would be injurious to the health and property of the consumers. The Bill was thrown out, and the Company has been left to contend with the difficulty since then, and to bring such means to their assistance as they could devise. I have visited the Works, and find that the improved means, though perhaps all that the Company are able to adopt, are very slight. They consist in a more efficient ventilation of the lime before removal, the prevention of the fumes passing into the air during the process by tarpauling covers, &c., and by doing the work early in the morning. I have no doubt that these measures have been to an extent effectual; but it does seem, upon undisputed evidence, that occasionally and possibly under particular atmospheric conditions, the stench is very great and unbearable, and that sometimes it is felt most near to the Works, and at other times passes over the immediate vicinity and makes itself felt at a greater distance. I may observe that the manufacture of gas is very much reduced at these Works, and that it is not necessary to open a purifier more than about once in three weeks or a month; but this small scale can only exist during the summer months, unless the Beckton and other factories, as well as the mains which supply the Metropolis from these Works are enlarged at a large expense. How far that can be done I cannot presume to say. If gas is made to any large extent in the Metropolis without risk of occasionally creating this nuisance, the use of lime must be almost, if not entirely, discontinued, and more sulphur, perhaps equal to 50 per cent. of the present quantity, sent out with the gas and distributed in sulphurous vapours from the burners. But probably (although there are many eminent men who declare this to be a theoretical and inappreciable evil) the authorities would not permit it. The only other remedy is to drive the manufacture out of London altogether. I consulted an eminent equity barrister some time ago upon the legal means at the Vestry's command to protect the inhabitants, and he was of opinion that if the nuisance could be proved to the satisfaction of the Court, the Company might be restrained. A Bill would have to be filed against the Company, at the instance of the Parish, in the name of the Attorney General, and propablyan Order might be obtained restraining the Company, not from making gas, which they have statutory powers to do, but from causing a nuisance by using lime. The probable consequence 15 would be a relaxation of the Referees' standard of purity, which they cannot insist upon if it necessarily involves a nuisance. The terms of the Act are "The Gas Referees shall from time to time ascertain with what degree of purity the Company can reasonably be required to make and supply gas continuously without occasioning a nuisance to the neighbourhood in which the works are situate, and shall thereupon prescribe and certify the maximum amount of impurity, &c." If so, by a legal process the Company might be able to get rid of one nuisance, by creating as alleged, another, which process the Committee of the House of Commons refused to sanction. The action of the Vestry in a legal direction would necessarily involve considerable expense, and of course such proceedings are always uncertain. The Medical Officer and myself make no recommendation, we simply set forth the facts of the case, and must leave it to the Vestry to determine whether the proof of the nuisance is sufficient, and whether any, and if so what steps should be taken. I am, yours obediently E. WALKER, Town Hall, Vestry Clerk. July 5th, 1879. DISORDERLY HOUSES. Although I have issued warnings to several persons complained of for keeping improper houses, which for the most part have had effect, I have not found it necessary during the past year to take proceedings against any persons for keeping brothels. THE MORTUARY. The provision of this place has proved to be of considerable advantage to the Parish, and the bodies of persons from Betlinal Green have also been admitted, under pressing circumstances, pending the provision of a similar institution for that Parish. The number of bodies admitted during the year was 152. No complaints as to any annoyance or nuisance have been made. 16 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. Appended are the Reports of Dr. Stevenson, Analyst. Prosecutions were instituted and convictions obtained in several cases, the penalties varying from £5 to the costs of the summons. The Act has practically put an end to food adulteration. Milk and butter are now almost the only articles in respect to which it is practised. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 153 times; the Council Chamber 13 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by Local Societies, mostly free of charge. The receipts for letting were £1,213 8s. 4d. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The number of Vestry and Committee Meetings held during the year ended April 30th, 1879, is as follows:— Number of Vestry Meetings 30 Finance Committee (including Meetings of Audit Committee) 27 Sewers, Sue., Committee 27 Lighting Committee 7 Sanitary Committee (including Meetings of Sub-Committee) 9 Valuation Committee 9 Town Hall Committee 21 Parliamentary and Improvement Committee 7 Appended is a list of Contracts taken by the Vestry for the year, with other requisite information. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, E. WALKER, Town Hall, Old Street, Vestry Clerk. July, 1879. 17 REPORT OF THE ACCOUNTANT. To the Vestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch.

To the Vestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. Gentlemen, 5068 births—2594 males and 2474 females—and 3232 deaths were registered in the twelve months ending 25th March, 1879. The mortality was 23.84 per 1000 living; above the average of the last five years, which was 22.4 per 1000. The largest number of deaths was registered in Haggerstone West District, in which is situated Shoreditch Infirmary. Population. Deaths. Average per 1000. Hoxton New Town 27835 784 28.16 Hoxton Old Town 26933 600 22.27 Haggerstone West 24162 796 32.94 Haggerstone, East 19259 437 22.68 St. Leonard 16545 366 22.12 Holywell 12430 249 20.0 32 552 deaths occurred in public institutions of the parish ; 320 in Shoreditch Infirmary; 200 in Holborn Infirmary, situated in Hoxton New Town; 17 in the North Eastern Hospital, and 15 in Hoxton House. Tracing the causes of death it is evident that the unusually severe and protracted cold and damp of the winter and spring promoted, if not mainly produced the excess in the death-rate. Diseases acknowledged to be caused by cold and damp were very destructive. There were 531 deaths from bronchitis, 316 from phthisis, and 201 from pneumonia. All lung affections are much influenced by cold and wet, and the mortality, therefore, from that class of disease was much in excess; 1227 deaths were registered under the head of pulmonary diseases, whilst in the previous year there were only 790. Severe cold and damp is very destructive to dawning and declining life—in infancy and old age—therefore an unusually large number of deaths was registered under one year, 963, against 708 the year before, and under five years of age, 1481 against 1240 in the previous year; 576 deaths occurred in persons at and over 65 years of age; 184 persons died from 75 to 85; 53 from 85 to 95, and 6 deaths were registered at 95 and upwards; whilst in the year previous, with much milder weather, 425 died at 65 and upwards; 63 from 75 to 85; 33 from 85 to 95, and 5 above 95. In infancy the largest number of deaths was caused by lung disease, 267, comprising—104 from bronchitis; 61 from pneumonia, and 78 from other pulmonary affections. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were atrophy and debility, 119 deaths; diarrhoea, 93; whooping cough, 83; convulsions, 80; premature birth, 57. In old age, 183 deaths were produced by lung disease, including—153 from bronchitis; 69 deaths by brain disease; but the largest number, 215, was registered under the term of "old age" 33 During the winter and spring months (December, January, February and March) of the year ending 25th March, 1879, there were 1168 deaths registered, whilst in the corresponding months of the previous year, when the cold was less severe, there were 1083 deaths. ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 538 deaths,—170 due to whooping cough; 129 to diarrhœa; 79 to scarlet fever, and 35 to measles. 83 of the 170 deaths from whooping cough occurred in infants under 1 year of age; 93 of the 129 deaths from diarrhoea occurred under 1 year. The influence of age is much more manifest, for 151 of the 170 deaths from whooping cough were in infants under 2 years, and 105 of the 129 deaths from diarrhoea occurred under 2 years of age. There were 10 deaths from smallpox, and the reports made to the Sanitary Department shew that the disease lingers in the parish, but the cases are mostly of a very mild kind. PROCEEDINGS TAKEN under the Nuisance Removal and Diseases Prevention Act. A great many sanitary improvements have been effected in the year, and in all parts of the parish; particulars of which are set forth in detail in Inspector Alexander's report appended. 1015 premises were inspected, and sanitary notices were served requiring the removal of dangerous conditions from 813 of those dwellings, 5463 separate conditions injurious to health were abolished. Their removal necessitated a great amount of careful sanitary supervision. Referring to these conditions the report shows that in 281 dwellings, where the old brick drains were defective, new pipe drains were laid; defectively constructed pipe 34 drains were repaired or relaid in 185 dwellings; new drains, where none existed before, were constructed in 23 premises; 54 cesspools were abolished. A great many of the old and much decayed small dwellings of the parish have been removed during the last few years, to make way for improvements of various kinds, but many still remain and necessitate much sanitary inspection. The progressive decay and crumbling down of the walls, floors, and roofs render it exceedingly difficult, and even impossible to repair and cleanse them in an enduring manner; and in not a few instances it is obviously a waste of money to attempt it. Some owners during the past year have wisely recognised it was wasteful, and have therefore pulled down the old structures and re-built houses of a superior kind well provided with sanitary conveniences, for instance in Foundry Place and elsewhere. In the year, more than 500 of the old dilapidated dwellings have been much improved, and provided with sanitary appliances requisite for health,—in other words made fit for human habitation. To shew the nature of the improvements it is enough to mention that the walls and ceilings were cleansed and repaired throughout in 414 houses, partly in 215 houses; roofs repaired in 150; floors repaired in 73. Dangerously dilapidated stairs repaired in 42; ventilation provided under floors in 44; waste pipes of sinks situated within the house, from which sewer gases escaped into the dwellings, were detached from the drain and made to terminate in the open air, and over the yard sinks, or the pipes were securely trapped in 185 premises. 548 closets were cleansed and repaved, and 521 of them provided with water supply. 97 sculleries were properly paved; 523 yards and areas were limewhited; 486 yards paved with impervious material, viz.: 35 with stone or cement concrete, to keep the ground under, and adjoining the houses as dry as possible; the pavement of 148 other houses was repaired, and 258 dust-bins were erected. HOUSE DEAINAGE.—Year by year adds to the large experience already acquired, shewing that the drains in a very large number of the dwellings of the parish have been for many years in a dangerous condition; many of the drains removed during the year were old decayed leaking brick structures, saturating the ground under and around the houses with decomposing organic matters—aiding the outbreak and advance of disease. Other drains were so badly laid, without proper fall, that their channel had become narrowed and filled up with solidifying sewage deposit, and sewer gases were forced up into the dwellings. In one instance the drains of the seventeen houses of Hutley Place, throughout their course, were blocked with sewage matters; the drain, the Inspector reports, appeared to have been laid in the most thoughtless and improvident manner; straight pipes were placed where curved ones should have been used; brick receivers were found which tended largely to check the flow of sewage, and no attempt seemed to have been made to seal the joints of the pipes, indeed some of the pipes had open spaces between them, and the leakage from them had softened the foundations to such an extent that the front and back walls of the houses Nos. 3 and 4, and the outhouses of Nos. 12 and 13 had settled down and bulged so dangerously that the Metropolitan Board ordered them to be taken down and rebuilt. The Sanitary Inspector's time has, to a great extent, been occupied in examining' into the conditions of drains, and in seeing that the new drains ordered were properly con- .36 structed. In the latter duty much energy and judgment were called for. ARTIZANS DWELLINGS IMPROVEMENT ACT, (Torrens'). —The dwelling's known as Moira Place have been reported under the powers of this Act, by the Medical Officer of Health, to be in a condition dangerous to health, and unfit for human habitation; further proceedings are now pending. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT.—The Sanitary Authorities during the past year have been obliged, in several instances, to direct men in their employ to enter premises, remove dangerous drains and construct new ones. Neglect on the part of owners of dwellings has necessitated these proceedings. This peremptory action is only adopted in cases where sewage has dangerously accumulated: for example, under the floors of inhabited houses or flooding the yards; and where repeated applications for the removal of the dangerous nuisance have been disregarded; or where the work has been so badly done and protracted; it. was beyond question that the dangerous conditions were not removed, and that the Owner would not carry out the orders of the Local Authority. CONSTANT WATER SUPPLY.—The constant service has now been in operation throughout the parish for more than twelve months. No complaint has been lodged against it, excepting of bursting of supply pipes; during the last six months these complaints have been few. The supply is evidently abundant. Cisterns and butts, which are usually found dirty and dilapidated, are still retained in many premises; but they are being removed by degrees, by order of the Sanitary Authority. SMALL POX.—68 cases of small pox were reported to the Sanitary Department; some of the infected persons were 37 isolated in their own houses, but 52 of them were removed to the small pox hospital. Inspector Fletcher reports that 309 infected dwellings were disinfected by sulphur fumigation and by free exposure to the open air, washing with carbolic acid, &c. 156 infected beds, 110 mattresses, a large number of pillows, making with other articles a total of 1336, were disinfected at the disinfecting oven. COW HOUSES.—There are 37 cow houses in the parish containing 411 cows; in the previous year there were 408 cows. Inspector Fletcher reports that he inspected these premises four times during the year, and found them on the whole fairly clean, paved and ventilated, according to the Vestry's regulations. The space allowed each cow averaged 860 cubic feet. Two old cow houses were abolished; no new ones were established in the year. REMOVAL OF DUST.—17,000 to 18,000 loads of dust were removed during the year; the dusting generally has been better done than in previous years, especially in the Western Division. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, HENRY G. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health. 39 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. St. Leonard, Shoreditch, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present the following report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendence during the year ending March 25th, 1879, shewing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement. House to house visitation; and special inspections with reference to complaints made in 1015 premises Notices served requiring the abatement of nuisances injurious to health in 813 premises 40 WORKS DONE TO SECURE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES. Glazed pipe drains provided in lien of dilapidated brick ones in 281 premises Defectively constructed pipe drains repaired or relaid in 185 „ Drains provided where there were none before in 23 „ Drains (untrapped) traps provided in 350 „ Cesspools emptied and filled up in 54 „ Stack pipes (having their heads dangerously close to bedroom windows, permitting sewer gas to pass into the dwellings) disconnected from drains in 259 „ Stack pipes provided in 29 ,, Eaves gutters provided in 29 „ Waste pipes, of sinks within doors (untrapped and permitting sewer gas to impregnate the dwellings) have been securely trapped, or otherwise disconnected from drains, and have now their ends in the open air, and immediately over yard sinks in 185 „ Roofs repaired in 150 „ Flooring repaired in 73 „ Stairs repaired in 42 „ Sashes reqaired in 15 ,, Walls and ceilings cleansed, whitened and repaired throughout in 414 „ Ditto ditto in part in 215 „ Ventilation provided under ground floor in 44 ,, Water-closets limewhited in 371 „ Water-closets (foul and dilapidated) cleansed and repaired in 548 „ Water restored or newly laid on to water-closets in 521 „ Obstructions in water-closets removed in 84 „ Yards and areas limewhited in 523 ,, Dust bins provided in 258 „ Dust bins repaired in 49 „ 41 Yards paved imperviously with stones or cement concrete in 486 premises Yard paving repaired, and rendered impervious in 148 „ Areas paved imperviously with stones or cement concrete in 30 „ Sculleries ditto ditto in 97 „ Sashes provided to give ventilation in 2 „ Making a total of 5,465 separate nuisances dangerous to health abated. To ensure the work done being as far as possible of a durable character, many re-inspections had to be made, and 282 letters were written, which took up much time, resulting, however, in the Owners having their work generally well done. A few instances are mentioned in detail, to show the manner of procedure, and the nature of the work accomplished. Nos. 1 to 10, ALMA STREET, 10 houses.—The 9 inch pipe drain extending from No. 1, through, and being the common drain of the premises Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, and passing under the house No. 9 was found in its course under No. 9 to have no fall, to be partly constructed of brickwork, and partly of pipes, causing by its defects the premises, No. 9 and 10 adjoining, to be flooded with sewage. The owner of No. 9 re-constructed (with moderate fall) the common drain, in its old course through his premises; it then became necessary to call on the owner of No. 8 to raise his part which was done, and so in succession through all the premises till No. 1 was reached. This completed satisfactorily a long and tedious proceeding, which will be easily understood when it is stated most of the houses belong to different owners, who each employed their own men to re-construct their portion of the common drain. 42 24, MONEYER STREET.—Close under the floor of the passage was found an old brick trench drain having little or no fall, covered with pieces of stone, tiles, wood, &c., choked full of, and overflowing excreta which flooded the space under the floor. It was ascertained the owner had frequently forced a passage through and temporarily cleared this drain, but only to become as bad as ever in the course of a short time. Repeated notices to abate the nuisance were entirely disregarded by the owner, which being reported to the Vestry, it was ordered that the premises be entered and the works done by the Vestry's builder. This was carried out and costs recovered at Worship Street Police Court. The foul drain and earth around it was removed, as also the contents of a cesspool found under the watercloset, and a proper drain provided. Nos. 7 and 8, BATEMAN'S ROW, 2 houses.—Generally dirty and dilapidated. In the underground room or cellar of No. 27 measuring 525 cubicfeet, were found living a man, his wife and 4 children. The atmosphere was filthy in the extreme. In one corner of this place stood a sink, having no cover or trap to its waste pipe, which went direct into the drain under the floor; in the other corner (placed against the door. of what had been a coal cellar) stood a bedstead; on this bedstead being removed large qualities of human soil were found accumulated on the dilapidated floor, which oozed from the cellar door. On this door being opened it was found soil had accumulated over the whole area of the cellar to a height of 18, occasioned by the trap and pan of the water-closet placed immediately over the said coal cellar being* broken. The family were speedily removed, and the place thoroughly purified, repaired and altered. HU'TLEY PLACE, 17 houses.—The interiors were generally dirty and dilapidated; the yards were unpaved; waterclosets foul and dilapidated with no water laid on; water for drinking purposes was stored in small foul butts and 43 cisterns. There were no dust bins save such as were so dilapidated as to be useless. The back and front walls of the houses Nos. 3 and 4, and the outbuildings of Nos. 12 and 13 were so dangerously dilapidated (resulting from defective drains) that the Metropolitan Board compelled the owners to take them down and re-build them. The yards were flooded with sewage caused by the drains which were found in the following condition. The drains of the houses Nos. 1 to 7 were connected with a main drain passing to the sewer under the passage of the house No. 3, laid close to the party wall of No. 4. This drain which throughout its course was solidly blocked, appeared to have been laid in the most thoughtless manner. Straight pipes were found where curved ones should have been used to secure an easement. Brick receivers were formed which tended largely to check the flow of sewage, and no attempt appeared to have been made to seal the joints of the pipes; indeed some of the pipes had open spaces between, the leakage from which caused the subsidence of the party wall of Nos. 3 and 4, and consequently the dangerous condition of the back and front walls referred to. The outhouses, under which the branch drains were necessarily laid, have all suffered much from the same cause, especially those of Nos. 12 and 13, which as before stated it has been neccessary to take down and re-build. A good system of drains has been laid down ; waterclosets thoroughly cleansed and repaired; water laid on and concrete floors provided; yards have been paved with concrete; improved dust bins provided; water supplied direct from the main, and the houses cleansed and repaired. It may be useful to state that these houses have only been built about 20 years, and to point out again, that their ruinous condition involving the owners in very heavy expenses, for re-construction was a sure and natural result 44 of the gross carelessness which caused or permitted the drains to be laid in the manner described. Attention is particularly drawn to this, as even at the present time a very large proportion of the new drains ordered by the Vestry would be laid in a similar manner were it not for close supervision. A HOUSE IN BRIDPORT PLACE.—Scullery sink directly connected with drain and untrapped. Yard sink untrapped. Water stored in an uncovered cistern placed over the dustbin, and exposed to contamination. Drain defectively constructed, and causing recurring stoppages. Three children, the entire family of tenant, having died of scarlet fever within a fortnight, led to an inspection of the premises, and to the discovery of the evil conditions mentioned, which were speedily removed. KING'S NORTH PLACE, 8 HOUSES.—These houses were generally dirty and dilapidated. Water for drinking purposes was stored in foul dilapidated cisterns. The water closets were very foul and dilapidated, and without water. The yards were defectively paved with broken stones and bricks which laid loosely imbedded in liquid filth. The dust-bins in these small yards were also foul and dilapidated. The drains were very defectively constructed of small pipes laid very shallow, and with little or no fall which had frequently caused the yards to be flooded with sewage. It being represented to the Vestry that these houses could not be properly drained owing to the shallow and defective condition of the sewer in Pimlico Walk. The Vestry thereon directed a, new 12" pipe sewer to be laid from Hoxton Street. The owner thereupon laid in good drains, cleansed and repaired the water closets, laid on water, and paved the floors with cement concrete. Paved the yards, removed all the foul old dust- bins, and provided one large substantial public receptacle 45 of improved construction, and provided a constant supply of water to the inhabitants by a draw-off tap, in each yard, direct from the main. BROWN'S BUILDINGS, CLIFTON STREET, 8 houses.—The open court surrounded by these houses was unpaved, defectively drained., and consequently very foul. The back yards were very defectively paved and drained. The broken stones, bricks, &c., forming the so-called pavement, laid embedded in black liquid filth. These small foul yards contained the dust accumulations (there were no dust-bins, public or private), and the water closets, which had no water laid on, were filthy and dilapidated in the extreme. The houses were generally dirty and dilapidated, and the drains a conglomeration of bricks and pipes laid in the most random manner, added to which it was found that under the eight water closets, there were four very large cesspools full of fœcal matter. The whole of these evil conditions have been removed, the cesspools were emptied and filled up with lime rubbish, new glazed pipe drains laid down. The yards decently paved with cement concrete, and fitted with receptacles for slops. The water closets thoroughly cleansed and repaired, cement floors provided, and water laid on; the houses cleansed and repaired. The public court paved all over in a proper manner, and one public dust-bin of improved construction provided. The atmosphere of these dwellings has been much improved by these works. HOUSES UNFIT FOR HABITATION.—Nos. 9, 10 and 11, Moira Place. These houses being dirty, dilapidated, damp, and unfit for habitation. Notice was served by order of the Committee requiring the houses to be closed, which was done. Nos. 3 to 11, Wright's Buildings.—Sanitary notice was served requiring the owner to close these houses, 46 which from their dirty and dilapidated condition were unfit for habitation. The owner thereon made application to the Sanitary Committee, which was acceeded to, to defer proceedings for twelve months, he undertaking to temporarily cleanse and repair the premises, and at the expiration of the said twelve months to demolish the houses, and build on their site a superior property, which has been done. 4, Soawfell Street.—This place being extremely dirty and dilapidated was closed in compliance with the Vestry's order. Nos. 234 and 236, Hoxton Street.—These houses, which are old wooden buildings, very dirty and dilapidated, have been closed by the owner, and let on a building lease, rather than make any attempt to deal with the old houses. No Police Court summonses, for the abatement of nuisances have been taken out during the year. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, H. ALEXANDER, Sanitary Inspector. 47 INSPECTOR FLETCHER'S REPORT. St. Leonard, Shoreditch, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report to you that during the year ending March 25th, 1879, the conditions named below have caused nuisances dangerous to health, and were inspected and remedied under my supervision. Accumulations of dung &c., removed from 9 premises Dung pits provided in 9 „ Obstructed closet drains, repaired and cleansed in 2 ,, Rooms overcrowded in 2 dwellings Water supply re-instated in 27 premises Smoke nuisances abated in 3 „ Corpses decomposing, removed from 11 „ Minor nuisances not referred to Inspector Alexander; little alteration needed in 9 „ 48 NUISANCES DANGEROUS TO HEALTH CONSEQUENT ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES.—The following details shew the sanitary measures adopted where cases of contagious diseases occurred. No. of houses inspected and disinfected 302 Notices served requiring occupiers to disinfect articles liable to retain infection in 302 premises 68 cases of small pox were reported to the Sanitary Authorities. Much care was taken to prevent the spread of this disease by isolating the sick and disinfecting the houses, drains, &c. 52 of the above cases were removed to the Small Pox Hospital, 16 were not removed. No. of infected beds disinfected at the Vestry's disinfecting oven 156 ,, Pillows ditto ditto 186 ,, Mattrasses ditto ditto 110 „ Bolsters ditto ditto 138 „ Other articles ditto ditto 746 Making a total of 1,336 articles disinfected. The inspection of infected premises has occupied much time and attention; especially in securing the isolation of infected persons by their removal to Hospitals, &c. Sanitary notices were subsequently served on the owners and occupiers requiring them to cleanse and disinfect the houses; also to strip paper from walls where necessary, and the rooms disinfected by sulphur fumigation and aeration, and the bedding and clothing removed to the disinfecting oven at the rear of the Town Hall. COW HOUSES.—There are 37 cow houses in the parish—19 in the Eastern Division, and 18 in the Western Division. 49 In the cow-houses of the Eastern Division there were (at the time of my inspection) 177 cows; and in the Western, 234, making a total of 411, as against 408 of the previous year. The average cubic space for each cow in the sheds throughout the parish was 860 feet (measured) as against 893 of the previous year. I inspected every cow-house at least four times during the year, and on the whole I found them fairly clean. The cow-sheds at No. 15, Hearn Street, Curtain Road, have been discontinued in consequence of alteration of premises. No fresh applications have been received for licenses for cow-houses. REMOVAL OF DUST.—During the year ending 25th March, 1879, the dust on the whole has been fairly removed from the parish, and there has been a less number of applications for the removal of dust from private dwellings than in previous years, more particularly in the Western Division of the parish. The number of applications during the past year compared with the number of applications during the previous three years is shewn below. Eastern Division. Western Division. 1st. 2nd. 3rd. 1st. 2nd. 3rd. 1878-79 1083 2 0 1192 7 0 In the three previous years the average number was 1489 14 0 2691 32 0 50 The plan of exposing the letter D in the front window when an inhabitant requires the dust removed has answered satisfactorily; but the dustmen have not attended regularly in the respective streets on the days named in the contract. The removal of dust is bettor attended to than in years past, but there are always large accumulations, speaking generally, and this to a great extent is due to the neglect of the inhabitants themselves in not sufficiently recognising the necessity for its removal. To shew how enormous is the quantity of dust and the accumulations of decomposing matter it is enough to mention that from 17 to l8,000 loads of dust were removed during the year. SCAVENGING. The system adopted by the Vestry last year of accepting the proposals of two contractors, viz: one for the Eastern and one for the Western Divisions, has been found to be a great improvement, and has been the means of getting the work done in a way satisfactory to the Vestry and the Public generally. Despite the long and severe winter, the complaints were very few. WATERING THE ROADS. The watering was carried out under my superintendence. Some difficulty was, during the first portion of the Season, experienced in consequence of the contractor for the provision of horses and men not fully complying with his engagement with the Vestry, but the Vestry on the recommendation of its Paving Committee having resolved to employ other carts &c., at the Contractor's expense, was the means of at once producing the desired effect, and no further trouble was experienced. The complaints during the season were very few. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. R. FLETCHER, Sanitary Inspector. APPENDIX A. SITUATION OF THE URINALS IN THE PARISH. 1.

Your Committee are now able to present their first Annual Report in respect to Public Lighting by the Average Meter System. It will be in the recollection of the Vestry that after the amalagmation of the Independent Gas Company with the Gas Light and Coke Company, the Vestry required the latter company to enter into a proper contract, under seal, to contain penalty clauses in case of failure to light, or other default. This the Company persistently declined to do. and on being pressed, gave notice to the Vestry to take the gas by meter, which they had power to do. The Vestry having before them favorable reports from other important Parishes accepeed the position, and resolved to adopt the Meter System. After much consideration by the Lighting Committee (a Sub-Committee of the Paving and Lighting Committee of last year), they recommended the acceptance of the tender of Mr. W. Sugg, of Westminster, for Meters, Governors, &c., and the new system came into operation on the 1st of April, 1878. Previous to that time the Gas Company charged at the rate of 4,300 hours per lamp per year, at an estimated consumption of 5-ft. per hours* and since Januart, 1877, at 3s. 6d. per 1,000 feet. This would be for gas per lamp per year, £3 15s. 3d. At the same time the Company raised the charge for lighting, cleansing and repairs from 15s. to 18s. per year, making a total charge per lamp per annum of £4 13s. 3d. The average number of lamps which have been maintained during the past year is 1,309½, *There were 60 lumps in the Old Chartered District (south of Worship Street) fitted with 4-ft. burners, and charged according to the rate adopted by the Chartered Company. which was in excess of that of the Independent company. II. and the total charde under the old system would have been £6,384 12s. 2vd. The actual anount paid during the year 1877-8 was £5,743 0s. 4d., but the average number of lamps was 1,24S, being 121½ less than during the past year, and the consumption of 60,* as above stated, was 4-ft. per hour. For a short time 50 lamps in Great Eastern Street were charged at a somewhat higher rate. In estimating the cost of the past year's lighting, wre have taken, 1st—The actual cost of gas (Table VI., b. d. f. h.) ; 2nd—The cost of repairs by contract, lamplighters' wages, and sundry small repairs (Table III.); 3rd—Contractor's annual charge for maintenance of meters, governors, Inspector's salary and petty expenses (Table TV.); 4th—One-tenth of the cost of providing meters, governors and other requisites, set out in Table I.; but Table IF. is not included, as the Vestry must have borne the cost of providing new lamps, columns, &c., if ordered, whichever might have been the system in operation. These figures will give a saving of £705 5s. 6^d., or about lis. 2d. per lamp. There is a further receipt of £89 7s. Od. for lamps to be paid for by railways and theatres ; but these can hardly be brought into account in favor of the Meter System, as it might have been obtained under the former. In estimating the actual economy of the Meter System, we are bound to have a fair regard to the number of hours of lighting and to the rate of consumption. It was always questioned whether the burners supplied by the Company did consume during the entire night the full estimated quantity, and whether the full number of hours of lighting was strictly observed. But assuming that the requirements in both cases were correct, then the consumption per lamp has been 526 hours per year less ; and 5-ft. per hour for those 52C hours, and 4/10tlis per foot per lamp for 3,774 hours, gives a reduced consumption per lamp of 4,140-ft. per lamp per year (actual shown on table, 4,241-ft.), or about, in money, 14s. lOd. per lamp. We may therefore assume, that by reduced hours and *See foot note on previous page. III. smaller burners, we have, lamp for lamp, 14s. l0d. worth less gas. There is, however, a real saving of nearly 1s. l0d. per lamp in lighting, cleansing and maintenance, which would give a total of 10s. 5d. per lamp; but against this has to be set the proportion of the cost of providing meters, &c., 1.10th of original cost, and the cost of repairs to ditto, and Inspector's salary^-about 5s. 4d. per lamp, and we get the actual reduced cost per lamp at lis. 4d. About 151^ lamps have been added at the commencement of the New System. The lesser number under the old system would have cost the Parish £5,678 18s. 6d. per year. The total cost of the whole number, including the 151½ new ones, for the past year is £5,619 6s. 8d., as against £5743 0s. 4d. actually paid for the previous year, being £123 13s. 8d. in favor of last year. We find, therefore, that we have added 151½ lamps, and supplied, maintained and lighted them at a less cost of £59 lis. lOd. than the smaller number would have cost, and we have also the satisfaction of having the work done under our own supervision, and thus a means of ensuring greater care and efficiency, which we have no hesitation in saying will result in a saving and advantage to the ratepayers. All of which is respectfully submitted. (Signed) D. KING, April, 1879. Chairman. Saint Leonard Shoreditch, TO THE LIGHTING COMMITTEE OF THE VESTRY OF ST. LEONARD, SHOREDITCH. April, 1879.
