AC 4421 (3) East Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1957 BY C. M. SCOTT, M.R.C.S. (Eng.), L.R.C.P. (Lond.) Medical Officer of Health to the Council TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF W. K. PICKUP, M.R.S.H. Chief Public Health Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1957 BY C. M. SCOTT, M.R.C.S. (Eng.), L.R.C.P. (Load.) Medical Officer of Health to the Council TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF W. K. PICKUP, M.R.S.H. Chief Public Health Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1957. To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present my report for the year 1957. Vital Statistics show remarkably little variation from last year's figures and the population of the district has apparently nearly reached its peak. There are only two items worthy of comments in the statistics, (1) 1957 was a "Measles Year" and it seems that the total of notifications received was a reasonably accurate figure of the number of cases in the district—a comment which could not be made as regards notifications of other infectious diseases. Once again attention is drawn to the necessity for prompt notification—necessary in all cases of notifiable diseases, but absolutely essential in cases of suspected food poisoning if subsequent investigation is to be of any real use. (2) The large increase in deaths due to cancer of the lung. This is in line with the national figure and is a matter causing considerable concern. So far no completely adequate answer has been produced for the increase—though there can be no reasonable doubt that smoking to excess is one of the important factors in the causation of the disease. Protection against poliomyelitis is now generally acceptable but it does not seem that supplies of vaccine will be sufficient to cope 3 with the number of applicants for several months—but there is no reason to believe that the situation is any more difficult in Hertfordshire than in the rest of the country. Housing problems continue to remain our greatest headache and are detailed in the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. Headway is being made but there are still many unfit houses and overcrowding cases to be dealt with. The Department has been active in Food Hygiene and the work involved has paid dividends. There are few aspects of Public Health more rewarding than the insistence on pure clean food, properly handled. Once again I would like to thank the Chief Officers and staff's of other departments for their help and co-operation on many occasions. C. M.

Totals 13 7 4 3 2 - - - 9 ANALYSIS OF VITAL STATISTICS 1. The Registrar General's mid-year estimate of population for 1957 is 40,950. This is an increase of 290 on the previous year. The two previous years showed a decrease of 70. The number of persons per house remains the same in 1957 as in 1956 as the number of inhabited houses has increased in the same ratio as the population. 2. The number of live births has decreased from 534 to 529. The two previous years showed slight increases on the number of live births. There has been a corresponding decrease in the birth rate from 13.9 to 13.2. The rate is still .2 higher than it was in 1955. The number of illegitimate births has fallen considerably in relation to the previous year's figures, it is, however, slightly higher than the average over the last 10 years. As stated in the last year's report there is a wide fluctuation year by year in these figures and it is only possible to draw definite conclusions when the trend over several years is considered. 3. The infantile mortality rate is 22.2 as against 13.5 in 1956. Last year, however, was an exceptionally low rate as the average of the last five years is 18. This year's figure is in fact higher than any other in that period. However, the total number of deaths this year is 11 as against 7 last year, the rate is changed considerably by one or two additional deaths. The death rate of illegitimate infants is 0. As stated before these figures have little or no significance as the numbers involved are so small. 4. The number of deaths from Cancer, 87, is a rise of 9 over 1956. Of this figure 28 deaths were due to Cancer of the Lung. This shows an increase of 16 on 1956. 5. In Table IV there are 27 new cases of Tuberculosis, a decrease of one on 1956. There are two deaths from this disease which is the same as 1956. The low figures on this table are in keeping with the general trend. 6. Infectious diseases show a very considerable increase during the year mainly due to the 804 cases of measles notified. There was an epidemic of measles during the year and probably the majority of cases were notified. There were only four cases of food poisoning notified. These cases were all isolated cases or cases occuring in the same family. No outbreaks of food poisoning occurred in the year. Water The water which is obtained from deep wells sunk into the chalk is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company. The Company maintains an up-to-date laboratory under the direction of a fully 10 qualified Chemist and Bacteriologist. During the year 1957, examinations were made on 255 chemical and 1,918 bacteriological samples of water, of which number 1,394 were bacteriological examinations of water samples representative of supply. Every one of the latter samples, i.e., 100 per cent., were found free from B. Coli I in 100 ml. In addition, the Water Company submitted 35 chemical and 65 bacteriological samples of water for independent analysis during the year, which included 59 bacteriological samples of water representative of supply also reported as being 100 per cent, free from B. Coli / in 100 ml. Ten samples were also taken by us and submitted for examination to the Public Health Laboratory. The reports were in every case satisfactory. 11 East Barnet Urban District Council ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR 1957 To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present my sixth annual report to the Council. The major new legislation during the year as regards Public Health has been the Rent Act, 1957, Clean Air Act, 1956, and the Housing Act, 1957. The Rent Act, 1957, has caused a considerable amount of additional work not only with regard to Certificates of Disrepair, Undertakings from Landlords, etc., but numerous visits from both the public and agents and owners of property. The number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair is tending to increase. The Clean Air Act, 1956, has not as yet caused any great additional work to the Department but undoubtedly will do so should the Council decide to consider the formation of a Smoke Control Area in the district. The Housing Act, 1957, does not make any alteration to the law and as stated in the paragraph on Housing is a consolidation Act. A considerable amount of work has been carried out in the field of Housing, although it does not show on Table II. The reason being that action on several premises is in the course of consideration by the Council. During the year there have been several cases in which owners have carried out works on receiving information that the Council is considering the serving of notices under the Housing Acts on their premises. 12 Generally the amount of work which the Department has dealt with throughout the year has shown an increase, although this is not apparent in the Tables. The Public Health Inspectors and the staff of the Department have continued to show a high standard of efficiency and have a good working knowledge of the new legislation. The Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. S. C. Smith, has given me great help during the year and has carried out his duties with keenness and enthusiasm. In conclusion I wish to tender my thanks to the staff of the Public Health Department and to other Officers of the Council for their assistance and co-operation during the year. W. K. PICKUP, Chief Public Health Inspector. 13 TABLE I Table of Visits and Inspections made during the Year Public Health 1956 1957 Nuisances and Sanitary Defects 4,236 4,105 Infectious Diseases 235 161 Schools 79 83 Smoke Observations 47 68 Caravan Sites 5 3 Brooks and Streams 31 41 Verminous Premises 7 4 Hairdressers and Barbers 21 —4,661 28 —4,493 Housing Housing Act, 1936, Part 2 1,613 1,875 Permitted Numbers and Overcrowding 21 138 Applicants for Housing (Special Cases) 38—1,672 51—2,064 Food Hygiene Restaurants and Snack Bars 352 342 Fish Shops 208 193 Butchers' Shops 325 319 Bakehouses 93 61 Ice Cream Premises 356 204 Other Food Shops and Premises 831 693 Food Inspections 185 191 Milk (Special Designations) Registrations 112—2,462 107 —2,110 Factories Factories 194 173 Outworkers 81— 275 114— 287 Infestations Rat and Mouse 2,473 2,382 Insects 276—2,749 194—2,576 Food and Drugs Sampling and in connection therewith 536— 536 483— 483 Shops Acts Visits made 702— 702 685— 685 13,057 12,698 14 15 TABLE II Housing Act, 1936 and 1957 Demolition Orders 1 Closing Orders 1 Houses demolished as a result of Orders 3 Houses on which work was carried out in pursuance of an undertaking under Section 11 Clearance Areas declared under Section 25— (Clearance Area) 10 Number of Notices Served during the Year 1956 1957 Informal Notices 173 84 Statutory Notices 25 19 Result of the service of these Notices as follows:— Preliminary Notices Statutory Notices 1956 1957 1956 1957 Complied with 152 79 26 22 Work in progress or in hand at end of year 1 4 1 Not complied with 20 22 5 3 TABLE III Improvements effected as a result of Notices served Exterior No. of Houses Roofs repaired and made weathertight 26 Rainwater pipes and rainwater gutters cleaned, repaired or renewed 14 Chimney pots and flues repaired 2 Brickwork repaired or repointed 8 Rendering repaired or renewed 3 Damp walls remedied 27 Choked drains cleared 20 Soil and vents repaired or renewed 3 Drains repaired or relaid 18 Exterior paving relaid or repaired 1 Dustbins renewed 19 Accumulations of refuse removed 3 Interior Wallplaster repaired or re-plastered 6 Ceilings repaired or re-plastered 8 Sinks renewed 4 16 Wastepipes repaired or renewed 3 W.C.'s and fittings repaired or renewed 7 Insufficient water supplies remedied 4 Stairs and staircases repaired or renewed 1 Floors and skirtings repaired or renewed 6 Doors and frames repaired or renewed 3 Window frames and sills repaired or renewed 5 Sash cords renewed 7 TABLE IV Factory Inspections FACTORIES ACT, 1937 Inspections for the purposes of provisions as to Health Premises.

The figures for 1956 are given for purposes of comparison. It will be noted that the amount of visits made are considerably less than on the previous year. In previous reports it has been pointed out that the number of visits have little relation to the actual amount of work. However, the number of complaints of various types received from residents has this year been less. It should be borne in mind that a number of defects which would normally have been recorded under this heading have been dealt with under the Rent Act, 1957, by the issue of Certificates of Disrepair or by the acceptance of Undertakings from landlords. Nuisances and Sanitary Defects The number of visits made under this heading are just over a hundred less than in 1956. These visits relate in the majority of cases to either complaints from residents or to subsequent visits referring to those complaints. The number of preliminary notices served during the year as may be seen in Table II is very considerably less than in 1956. As previously stated in the paragraph headed "General" the number of complaints received were less and it is normal that the preliminary notices are reduced. Table III shows a list of repairs carried out as a result of notices served on owners and is also reduced. Why there have been less complaints received is not known and can only be regarded as an improvement in general conditions affecting this heading. Over a period of years the nature of complaints has altered very considerably. The matters complained about in recent years would have been, in a large number of cases, regarded as trivial 20 years ago. However, all complaints relating to buildings, nuisances or hygienic conditions receive close attention and are dealt with when possible. The standards of Public Health have still room for considerable improvement but it is gratifying to see the advance that has been made over the past two decades. Infectious Disease and Food Poisoning The number of visits made in relation to this heading are considerably below those in 1956. These are directly related to the number of cases of infectious disease visited by the Public Health Inspectors. The diseases visited are Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever, Poliomyelitis, Food Poisoning and Dysentry. Other types of disease may receive a visit if the Medical Officer of Health so directs. Food Poisoning cases, of which only four were notified during the year, always receive close attention and every endeavour is made to trace the vehicle of infection. Schools The conveniences and canteens of schools are visited regularly. The school canteens in the main comply with the Food Hygiene 18 Regulations. In the event of any defect or of any contravention the County Council are informed. Visits are occasionally made at the invitation of the Canteen Supervisors to inspect food of which they are doubtful. Smoke Observations The usual observations have been taken on industrial chimneys in the district. With the coming of the Clean Air Act, a more comprehensive control will be organised over smoke not only from industrial but other chimneys. The Council will be considering the advisability of a Smoke Control Area within the district during the next year. Brooks, Streams, Verminous Premises, Hairdressers and Barbers Very little change occurs in the number of visits made in regard to these headings. The majority are of a routine nature. As far as verminous premises are concerned these get less year by year and no serious infestations exist in the district. FACTORIES During 1957 the routine visits to factories and outworkers for the purposes of the Factories Acts have continued and in the year in question 173 visits were made and 1 contravention was found. Notices were served on the occupiers of the factories and the necessary work was carried out. The condition of the factories generally in this area is reasonable as far as the Sections for which the local authority are responsible. Considering that there are 100 factories in the district the number of notices served is small. SHOPS ACTS Inspections made under these Acts show a slight decrease. The majority of the shops in the district close two hours or more before the permitted closing time and this practice now seems common in suburban areas. No serious contraventions were observed during the year. Although preliminary work was done in an endeavour to remove anomalies arising from different early closing days in parts of the district it has not yet been possible to frame new Early Closing Day Orders. HOUSING On the first September, 1957, the Housing Act, 1957, came into force. This Act consolidates the enactments relating to housing with the exception of certain provisions relating to financial matters. While the Act still contains the various sections, the numbers of the sections in many cases have been altered which at the moment is causing a certain amount of confusion. However, it is a great advantage to have the greater majority of the law as it relates to Housing contained in one Act instead of spread over five or six. In the year to which this report relates the amount of work in connection with housing has increased considerably. This increase is 19 reflected in the number of visits shown on Table I. Table II does not show an increase owing to the comparatively large number of premises which were under consideration by the Council at the end of the year and which consequently are not shown as premises on which action has been taken. In fact during the year reports on nine houses classed as unfit for human habitation have been made to the Housing Committee and the Medical Officer of Health has represented two areas as Clearance Areas. The Clearance Areas represented were both small, one consisting of four houses and the other six houses. At the beginning of 1957 there were seven houses on which Demolition Orders have been served, the Orders being operative but the houses not yet demolished and two Closing Orders. The premises on which Demolition Orders were outstanding being: 54 Edward Road, New Barnet 14 Warwick Cottages, New Barnet 8 Lyonsdown Road, New Barnet 10 Lyonsdown Road, New Barnet 19 Cat Hill, East Barnet 13 Victoria Road, New Barnet 15 Victoria Road, New Barnet. The premises on which Closing Orders exist being: 107 Leicester Road, New Barnet 9 Warwick Cottages, New Barnet. Of the houses subject to Demolition Orders three of these were demolished during the year, the three premises being 8 and 10 Lyonsdown Road and 19 Cat Hill, leaving four Demolition Orders outstanding. In addition to the above Demolition and Closing Orders outstanding the two Clearance Areas Albert Road and Margaret Road have not yet been cleared. The Compulsory Purchase Order on Margaret Road was confirmed during the year and some of the occupants have been rehoused. There are still several houses occupied in the Albert Road Clearance Area. These houses are deteriorating rapidly and the occupants should be rehoused as soon as possible. During 1957 the Medical Officer of Health represented two areas as Clearance Areas, one in Bulwer Road consisting of six houses which was formerly represented to the Housing Committee at the May meeting and one in Leicester Road of four houses at the June meeting of the Committee. The Bulwer Road Area consists of three pairs of semi-detached houses. The main reasons for the representation being dampness and general dilapidations. The Council have subsequently made a Compulsory Purchase Order on this Area and as there were several objections the Minister held a Public Enquiry at the Town Hall, New Barnet, on the 5th December. The Minister's decision was not received before the end of the year. 20 In the case of the other Clearance Area at Leicester Road the reasons for the representation being dampness, dilapidations and structural defects. The Council has made a Compulsory Purchase Order on this area and the Minister has arranged for a Public Enquiry to be held at the Town Hall on the 7th January, 1958. Reports have been made to the Housing Committee regarding nine other buildings which were unfit for human habitation, further details with regard to these premises follow. 149 Brunswick Park Road—A single house situated in a terrace of nine houses. The main defects being general dilapidations and both rising and penetrating dampness. After considering a report on this house the Council decided to make a Closing Order on the premises. Being a terrace house it was not practical to demolish the building without undue risk to the attached houses. In September the owner, through his agent, indicated that he wished to carry out works of repair and renovation in order to render the premises fit for habitiation. After consultation with the builder a specification was agreed on which would render the premises fit. The repairs as detailed in the specification were in progress at the end of the year. 2-2a Albert Road—This property is a detached house which is separated from the Clearance Area by other buildings. Consequently it could not be included and had to be dealt with as an individual unfit. It is comprised of two self-contained flats each having three rooms and a kitchen. It was reported to the June Housing Committee as an unfit premises the main defects being settlement to the structure, dampness and dilapidations. The Council at the July meeting after consideration accepted an undertaking from the owner not to use the premises for human habitation. 36 Clifford Road—This property is a detached house comprising eight rooms and a scullery. It was reported to the Housing Committee at the January meeting as unfit for human habitation the main defect being severe settlement of the structure. The Council at their April meeting made a Demolition Order on the premises. 53 Lyonsdown Road—A report was made to the Housing Committee at their July meeting stating that these premises were unfit for human habitation. The premises are a semi-detached house and the main defects were dampness and general dilapidations. After due consideration the Council at their October meeting accepted an undertaking from the owner to carry out the necessary works to render the premises fit. 55 Lyonsdown Road—A report on this property was made to the Housing Committee at their July meeting. The report intimated that the premises were unfit for human habitation by reason of their general condition, dampness, etc. At the meeting of the Committee considering these premises a specification was placed before the 21 Committee. After due consideration the Committee decided that they could not accept the specification unless certain additional works were carricd out. At the end of the year to which this report relates no agreement had been reached in regard to the matter and the Council has served notice of Time and Place for consideration of condition of house liable to be made subject to Demolition or Closing Order. The date for such consideration being sixth January, 1958. 158 Oakleigh Road South—This property was reported to the Housing Committee at the October meeting as unfit for habitation. It consists of a large semi-detached house of 13 rooms and bathroom. The main defects were general dilapidations and dampness. The Committee considered the report at the December meeting when the agent acting on behalf of the owner submitted a specification of works which they were prepared to carry out. The Council accepted the specification and an undertaking to carry out the works detailed in the specification was signed by the owner. 9 Richmond Road—A report on this property was made to the November Housing Committee stating that the property was unfit for habitation. The Committee served notices on the owners and other interested parties indicating that the making of a Demolition Order would be considered by the Housing Committee at their January meeting. 46a and 58a East Barnet Road—Reports on these properties were submitted to the December meeting of the Housing Committee who authorised the service of notices on the owners and other interested parties indicating that the making of Closing Orders on these properties would be considered by the February meeting of the Committee. RENT ACT, 1957 With the coming in force of the Rent Act, 1957, on the 6th July, 1957, a large number of enquiries have been received regarding the working of this Act and in particular the application of the Schedules dealing with the disrepair provisions. Up to the end of the year 15 applications for Certificates of Disrepair had been received from tenants. This is a relatively small number, much less than expected. However, instead of decreasing the number of applications shows a tendency to increase. The majority of the Forms G, that is the form compiled by the occupier of the house listing defects, contain items which are not objects of repair within the meaning of the Act. Consequently, the list of repairs served by the Council on the landlord giving him the prescribed notice that a Certificate of Disrepair will be issued if these works are not carried out, or alternatively the landlord gives an undertaking to carry them out within six months, differ in varying degrees with the occupier's list, Up to the end of the year seven Certificates 22 of Disrepair have been issued; in five cases the landlords have submitted undertakings and the other three cases are in the course of consideration, etc. FOOD HYGIENE In the year to which this report relates 2,110 visits were made to the various food premises in the East Barnet district. These visits show a decrease of 352 visits in comparison with 1956. In 1956 the Food Hygiene Regulations came into force and a considerable number of extra visits were made as a result. The figure for the visits made during 1957 is approximately the same as during 1955 which was a normal year. The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, have now been in force for two years. On the whole the Regulations have been observed though some verbal and written warnings have been given regarding smoking offences. At the end of the year a butcher who persistently disregarded these warnings was fined £5 at the Barnet Magistrates' Court for smoking in his shop whilst handling poultry. Some shop keepers have expressed concern that whilst they and their assistants are not permitted to smoke, customers often enter the shops smoking and scatter cigarette ash over the counters. The proprietor of a baker's shop in the district has displayed a notice requesting customers to refrain from smoking whilst in the shop and this is something which one would like to see more frequently in food premises. Whilst good equipment and planning aid greatly the selling or serving of food under hygienic conditions the key to the problem is the enthusiasm of the food handler him or herself in the matter and one careless worker can spoil the results of pounds spent on equipment or hours of planning. Whilst the majority of the premises in this district have now complied with the Food Hygiene Regulations there are a few still outstanding. Most of the premises are endeavouring to overcome difficulties in order that they may comply with the Regulations. On the whole very little difficulty has been experienced and cooperation between the Department and the Traders is very satisfactory. Milk Supply The following licences were granted to dealers to sell under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations 1936-1949: Tuberculin Tested 7 Pasteurised 11 Sterilised 15 The following supplementary licences under Principal licences granted by other authorities to sell milk from premises outside this area was also granted: Tuberculin Tested 12 Pasteurised 12 Sterilised 10 23 24 96 samples of milk were purchased and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Ministry of Health Public Health Laboratory at Coppetts Wood. No. of Samples Submitted Test applied:— (a) Methylene blue (b) Turbidity (c) Phosphatase. Result of Examination:— Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Void T.T. Pasteurised 20 (a) and (c) 20 — - T.T. Farm Bottled 11 (a) 11 - - Pasteurised 43 (a) and (c) 43 - - Homogenised Past Sterilised 17 5 (a) and (c) (b) 17 5 - This has been a year in which no sample of milk analysed tor cleanliness has been found to be unsatisfactory consequently the report on this heading is very short. It is hoped, however, that this very satisfactory position can be maintained. Ice Cream Eight applications were received for the registration of premises for the sale of ice cream. The premises and equipment being satisfactory the applications were granted. Ninety-six samples of ice cream were obtained and submitted for bacteriological examination with the following results: Provisional grade 1 90 „ „ 2 3 3 „ „ 1 „ „ 4 2 96 The six samples in grades 2, 3 and 4 were all loose ice cream. Again it has been necessary to make frequent visits to shops selling loose ice cream to ensure that the servers receive regular cleaning. There can be no doubt the cause for bad grading was improperly sterilised servers as subsequent samples taken after the servers had been sterilised under supervision all proved satisfactory. There are no premises manufacturing ice cream for sale in the District. The ice cream retailers obtain their supplies from large wholesale firms. This ice cream is manufactured to a very high standard and the quality remains constant. Meat and Other Food Inspections The requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, have been carried out as regards all premises on which meat is sold for human consumption. The inspection of food (other than meat) is carried out as necessary. As may be seen from the Table of foods surrendered as unfit during the year a total amount of approximately 8 cwts. of food was condemned. This was disposed of by burying, all meat and meat products being stained first. 25 FOOD AND DRUGS The following Table shows the various types of Food and Drugs sampled during the year and the results of analyses: Samples Analysed Samples Unsatisfactory Ball Gum 1 Black Pepper 1 Butter 3 Cocoa l Coffee, Essence Concentrated l Concentrated Chicken Broth 1 Condensed Milk, Full Cream 1 Condensed Milk, Machine Skimmed Crab Paste l Creamed Cottage Cheese 1 Cream, Clotted 1 Cream, Double 1 Curry Powder l Dressed Crab 3 Dried Milk 1 Drinking Chocolate 1 Evaporated Milk, Unsweetened 1 Fish Cakes 2 Flour, Self-Raising l Ground Almonds 1 Ground Cinnamon 1 Ice Cream 3 Jam l Lard 1 Lemon Juice 2 Lime Essence 1 Lollies, Cream 1 Lollies, Fruit 2 Margarine 3 Minced Chicken 1 Mincemeat 1 Milk 65 Milk, Channel Islands or South Devon 43 1 Mixed Sweet Herbs 1 Red Salmon 1 Rice 1 Salad Cream 1 Sausages, Pork 3 Soup, Asparagus 1 Soup, Chicken Noodle 1 1 Soup, Cream of Chicken 1 Soup, Cream of Tomato 2 Table Jelly 1 Tapioca 1 Tomato Ketchup 1 Vitadex Tablets 1 I Wheat Flakes 1 l 169 4 26 Included in the above Table are 97 informal samples which were examined at the office. The number of unsatisfactory samples was only one quarter of the number so reported in 1956. I would like to comment briefly on them. Milk A formal sample of South Devon Milk was found to contain only 3.85 per cent. of milk fat instead of the minimum quantity of 4 per cent. prescribed by the Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations, 1956. A summons, in respect of this offence, was heard at the Barnet Magistrates' Court on 1st May, 1957, when the defendants were granted an absolute discharge on the payment of £4 18s. Od. costs. Vitadex Tablets These tablets, manufactured by a local chemist, were advertised as being "The new health drink in tablet form containing Vitamins B and C plus energising glucose." Examination showed the tablets to be of an effervescing preparation and to contain Vitamins B and C in accordance with the advertisement. However, no declaration of the ingredients was given on the label of the container in which they were sold as is required by the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. In addition the tablets having been stated to contain Vitamins B and C, no declaration of the proportions of these vitamins per ounce was given on the label or in the advertisement as is required by the above mentioned Order. A letter was sent to the chemist concerned and the advertisement was immediately withdrawn and labels provided for the bottles in accordance with the Labelling of Food Order. Chicken Noodle Soup I commented in my last Annual Report on the unsatisfactory result obtained on the examination of a dry Soup Mix. A sample of the above soup examined showed that when prepared in accordance with the instructions the powder was diluted approximately fifteen times and the resulting soup, whilst palatable, contained between 0.5 and 0.6 per cent. of chicken meat. The label stated "Taste the chicken" but it was doubtful from the composition of the powder whether there was sufficient chicken present to impart a real chicken flavour and the main flavour was possibly due to the presence of a flavouring agent. It is understood that the question of the meat content of soups is now under review by Public Analysts and it is hoped that in view of the fact that these soup powders are now sold in very large quantities the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will give consideration to the question of laying down standards for the composition of such articles. The question of dried soup and soup mixes is being kept under observation. Wheat Flakes Following a complaint that a packet of breakfast cereal purchased locally was infested with bread beetles a visit was made to the shop and a further three packets obtained, all of which were similarly affected. Inquiries showed that the packets had been in stock for two years. Two summonses were issued under Sections 2(1) and 8(1) respectively of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and at Barnet Magistrates' Court on 18th September, 1957, the defendants were fined a total of £20 with £5 5s. Od. costs. OTHER INSPECTIONS Pet Shops Four persons are licensed to keep pet shops in the district. Visits are made periodically to the premises and in each case the business has been found to be carried on satisfactorily. There has been need once again to stress the importance of a supply of water and sand being readily available. A dropped cigarette end or match always constitutes a danger in premises where a considerable amount of straw and hay is used for animal bedding. INFESTATIONS Rodent Control During the year 368 complaints of rats and mice have been received. All complaints have been visited and in addition premises neighbouring the houses from which the original complaints were received have been visited where necessary. In consequence 485 properties have been inspected for rat and mice infestations during the year. Of these properties 392 were found to be infested and were treated for infestations. The number of complaints received show a very considerable increase on the previous year. The infestations have all been of a minor character and treatments have in general been successful. Where difficulty has been experienced re-treatment with variations of poisons and bait has produced satisfactory results. In accordance with the requirements of the Rodent Control Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food two treatments of the sewers were made. The first was made in June following the test baiting of 10 per cent, of the sewer manholes in the district. A maintenance treatment was carried out in November when 21 manholes were baited. Only seven "takes" were recorded and for this treatment Warfarin with para nitrophenol as a mould 27 28 inhibitor was used for the first time in the sewers. Inspections were made on the fourth, eighth and eleventh days after baiting, the amount of bait being doubled each time a "take" was recorded. No "takes" were recorded at the last inspection. Insect Control The numbers of complaints received regarding infestation by insects showed a very considerable decrease during the year. The numbers of complaints received in any period are unpredictable. All the complaints were visited and advice given and where necessary insecticides supplied free of cost. Wasps nests are destroyed by the Council on payment of a small charge to cover cost of materials and time. During the summer 71 nests were dealt with which is approximately 75 per cent more than the previous year.
