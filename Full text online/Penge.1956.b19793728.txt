To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1956, which has been compiled in accordance with Circulars 19/56 and 2/57, of the Ministry of Health. The Vital Statistics for the year once again show little change and compare favourably with those of other parts of the country. The birth rate still remains rather above the national average and, while the death rate shows a rise compared with that of the previous year, it is still slightly below that for the whole country. It is also notable that the proportion of deaths in people between 65 and 75 years of age is very much lower and those over 75 years slightly less. Once again there has been very little infectious disease in the district, the majority of the cases notified being whooping cough, which was in the main a mild type. Further posters were displayed advising on hygiene during the year and again there has been no outbreak of Sonne dysentery. For the ninth successive year no case of diphtheria has been notified, a proof of the success of immunisation, the need for which, however, does not lessen. Under the auspices of the Kent County Council a considerable number of children were immunised with the new poliomyelitis vaccine during the year. No ill-effects were reported as a result of it and one can only hope that as more vaccine becomes available the number of children treated will increase and that this disease will become as uncommon as diphtheria is today. The voluntary bodies have again continued their excellent work on behalf of the old people of the district whose conditions of life have been much improved as a result of their efforts. A few cases of food poisoning were all unconnected and it was not possible to identify the cause in any case. Further progress was made during the year with housing projects and during the latter part of the year as a result of official representation by myself two areas were declared clearance areas under the Housing Act, 1936. The year brought a major change in the staff of the Public Health Department when Mr. R. T. Pearce retired from the post of Chief Public Health Inspector as a result of ill-health after many years' service with the Council. His knowledge of his work and his willingness to help anyone will be much missed, not only by his colleagues, but by the district as a whole. For myself, I shall always be grateful for his help and friendship during the years we have worked together. To his successor, Mr. E. G. Thomas, previously his deputy, I can only say I am glad to have him as chief inspector. As a result of these changes the department has been one inspector short and in consequence some of the work has had to be left over until we have a full staff to cope with it. In a district such as this, with a considerable proportion of the properties consisting of multi-storey old Victorian houses let in flats, the amount of inspection required is more than average and entails a lot of work for the inspector. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 770 Population (Census 1931) 27,771 Population (Census 1951) 25,012 Home Population, Mid-year 1956 (estimated by Registrar General) 25,540 Rateable Value, 1st October, 1956 £351,579 Sum represented by Id. rate £1,380 The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey, is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level, and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33, this being by far the highest in the County of Kent. This results in there being very few open spaces in the district, the largest one being the grounds of the old Crystal Palace, the majority of which are in this area. This density of building has caused a shortage of space for school playing fields for the schools of the district and pupils mainly have to go outside the area for games. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that there were approximately 103 men and 55 women in the Penge area registered as unemployed at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS Crude Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home Population 19.38 Adjusted Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home Population 17.44 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home Population 0.39 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still births) 20.2 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home Population 11.6 Adjusted Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home Population 11.368 Death Rates of Infants under One Year of Age All infants per 1,000 live births 18.18 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 16.2 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births 2.02 Births The live births registered during the year numbered 495 compared with 520 in 1955. This gives a crude live birth rate of 19.38 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 20.41 for 1955. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar General for the purpose of securing comparability between local birth rates is 0.90. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 17.44 compared with 18.37 in 1955. 5 Stillbirths The number of stillbirths registered was 10, equal to a rate of 20.2 of 1,000 total births, compared with 17.00 for 1955. Deaths The deaths registered totalled 297, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 11.6 per 1,000 Home Population, compared with 10.24 in 1955. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local death rates is 0.98. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 11.368 compared with 9.64 for the years 1954 and 1955. The Death Rate for England and Wales was 11.7 and was the same as that recorded for 1955. Deaths among the inmates of an Institution for elderly men numbered 13. A large proportion of deaths were of elderly people, and of the total deaths 158 or 53.2% were of persons 65 years of age and over, compared with 68.2% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 43.1% of the total deaths, compared with 45.6% in 1955. Cancer Deaths from cancer numbered 48, giving a death rate for 1,000 Home population of 1.61% compared with 1.90 in 1955. The rate for England and Wales was 2.075%. Tuberculosis The death rate per 1,000 Home population was 0.202 against 0.039 for 1955. The rate for England and Wales was 0.121. Maternal Mortality There was one maternal death during the year, making the rate 0.33 per 1,000 (live and still) births, compared with no maternal deaths for 1955. The rate for England and Wales was 0.56 compared with 0.54 in 1955. Infantile Mortality The number of deaths under one year was 9, corresponding to a rate of 18.2 per 1,000 births, compared with a rate of 26.92 for 1955. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 23.8. Eight of the 9 infants died under the age of four weeks, one of whom died from congenital malformations. Comparative Vital Statistics The following table shows the comparative figures for 1956:— per 1,000Home Population Rate per 1,000 total births Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live Births[/##] Live Births Still Births Penge Urban District 17.4 20.2 11.368 18.18 England and Wales 15.7 23.0 11.7 23.8 6 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, all the houses in the area being provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Two storage cisterns were renewed, cleansed or covered. Drainage and Sewerage All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewerage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. Additional manholes were constructed in the Council's sewers during the year. Rivers and Streams There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham, the whole of which is culverted. Closet Accommodation The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. Public Cleansing House refuse was collected throughout the district once every week by the Council's refuse collection service using modern vehicles, and the refuse taken for disposal to the Beckenham destructor. Trade refuse is also dealt with. There are no cesspools in the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The subject is dealt with under the heading of Housing and in the Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. HOUSING The erection of 32 flats and 14 maisonettes by the local authority was completed during the year. Private builders erected 8 dwellinghouses, 27 flats and 2 maisonettes, and provided 11 flats by converting existing houses. 1.

PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Diphtheria For the ninth year in succession no cases of diphtheria occurred in the district. Scarlet Fever There were seven cases of scarlet fever notified (as against 17 in 1955) and two cases were removed to hospital. The disease generally was of a mild type and there were no " return " cases. No deaths were recorded. Paratyphoid Fever One case was notified during the year. Typhoid Fever One case was notified during the year. Poliomyelitis No case was notified during the year. Sonne Dysentery There was only one case of Sonne Dysentery during 1956.

During the year three bodies were dealt with by the Council under these provisions. FOOD The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, came into operation during the year. As a result the handling and storage of food should now be more hygienically carried out. The education of all food handlers whether in factory, shop or home in personal hygiene cannot be too strongly stressed. Freedom from food poisoning and diseases such as dysentery and enteric fever, is in a great measure associated with the simple precautions of handling food with clean (washed) hands. During the year posters stressing this were exhibited throughout the district. The classification of the various food businesses by type is as follows:— I. (a) Retail food shops (excluding cafes and restaurants and licensed premises) 149 (b) Cafes and restaurants 21 (c) Licensed premises 25 (d) Food manufactories 20 (e) Bakehouses 7 (f) Food stalls 11 II. Number of food premises registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, used for:— (a) Sale or manufacture for purpose of sale of ice-cream, or the storage of ice-cream intended for sale 86 (b) The preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale 39 III. Dairies registered under the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949 4 IV. Number of inspections of registered food premises 371 There are no ice-cream manufacturers in the district. No animals were slaughtered in the district. Food Poisoning Eight isolated cases, all of unknown origin, were reported, but it was not possible to obtain specimens of food eaten to identify the cause. Special posters illustrating the causes of, and advice on how to prevent, food poisoning were exhibited in a prominent position in the Public Library, and the School and Maternity and Child Welfare Clinics. The posters were also displayed on notice boards and other sites in the district and at school canteens. 12 MORTUARY During the year 23 bodies were brought to the Mortuary where post-mortem examinations were conducted by a Home Office Pathologist. A refrigerating chamber is installed in the Mortuary. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordial support during the year, and also to the staff of the Public Health Department for their ready co-operation at all times, particularly in view of the extra work entailed by the absence of members of the staff through illness, I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, B.

To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, In presenting the Annual Report of the work of the Public Health Inspectors for the year ended 31st December, 1956, I desire at the outset to refer to the retirement on health grounds on the 30th September of Mr. R. T. Pearce, who has guided the department in the capacity of Chief Inspector since 1928. Mr. Pearce's retirement severed a most happy official relationship between him and the writer since the year 1930, and I feel that not only the department, but I also owe a debt to him for his wise administration and guidance. The year has been a particularly difficult one for the department. Mr. Pearce was absent during the greater part of the year prior to his retirement, and in addition Mr. C. W. Briggs was admitted to hospital and the department was without his services for over four months. The vacancy in the department caused by Mr. Bell's promotion to Deputy Chief Inspector was not filled during the year. I am indebted to Mr. Bell and Mrs. A. L. Sheppard for their co-operation by which it was made possible to overcome in a large measure the difficulties arising from shortage of staff. The shortage of staff is reflected in the reduction of visits compared with those carried out during 1955. During the year 785 complaints (excluding those in connection with rodent infestation) were received, the great majority being concerned with housing defects and nuisances. All complaints were investigated and appropriate action taken when necessary. Applications for certificates of disrepair were received and granted in respect of four premises, and two applications for revocation certificates were received and granted. In addition to verbal intimation of defects in premises 536 written informal notices and 67 statutory notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1936. Five hundred and ninety-two intimation notices and 37 statutory notices were complied with. The Local Authority, in default of the owners, had carried out works required by 9 statutory notices under Sections 39 and 453 Public Health Act 1936, two notices served under Section 75 and two notices served under Section 94. The Council also did the work required by 8 notices served under Section 24, Public Health Act, 1936, respecting defective public sewers (previously known as combined drains) at 9 premises. The amount of work done following action taken by your Inspectors will be seen on reference to the summary of work executed. Every endeavour is made informally to have notices complied with before statutory action is taken. 16 It was found necessary to institute legal proceedings against the owners or agents of 5 properties in order to abate nuisances caused by housing defects, with the following results:— case no. result 1 and 2 Summons adjourned sine die as a contractor was instructed to carry out the work between the taking out of the summons and the date fixed for hearing. 3 Nuisance order made to do work within 3 months. 4 Summons adjourned sine die as the Solicitors for the defendant had been authorised to give instructions for the work to be carried out. 5 Summons for non-compliance with Court Order to abate a statutory nuisance. Fined £3. Closing Orders were made under Section 12, Housing Act, 1936, respecting six basement flats and two basement rooms, which did not comply with the regulations as to underground rooms and could not be made fit for human habitation at reasonable cost. The drainage systems of 17 premises were relaid or partially relaid and 76 cleared of obstruction. Disinfestation of 60 rooms found to be verminous was carried out. Five licences to deal in game were issued during the year.

FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS, 1955 The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, came into operation on 1st January, 1956. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure the hygienic handling and storage of food, with the object of protecting food from the risk of contamination. In an endeavour to achieve this object the regulations lay down provisions inter alia relating to personal cleanliness of food handlers, compulsory notification of certain diseases amongst food handlers, the provision of facilities for washing food and equipment, besides general requirements concerned with hygienic storage and food handling. The regulations necessitated a routine inspection of food premises and stalls, and as a result of such inspection it was necessary in a number of cases to require the provision of such fitments as sinks, wash-hand basins and hot and cold water supply to be made. A summary of such requirements found necessary during the year is as follows:— Provision of wash-hand basin with hot and cold water laid over 40 Provision of tables with tops of impervious material 8 Provision of sinks with hot and cold water laid over 16 Provision of first-aid equipment 6 Provision of refrigerators 2 Provision of ventilated lobby between store and W.C. 2 Provision of cupboards for personal clothing 3 The co-operation and help received from the occupiers of food premises in securing the requirements of the regulations, particularly since in many cases it involved them in no little expense, should be placed on record. Your public health inspectors continued to give advice to occupiers of food premises on matters relating to food and general hygiene.

All other factories in the district burn smokeless solid fuel. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Complaints numbering 257 regarding rats and mice were received from all parts of the district and investigated. In several cases it was found that defective drains and sewers were associated with rat infestations and the keeping of animals contributed to the number of infestations. When considered necessary the drainage systems of premises were tested with smoke and colour and any defects found made good. As in previous years, the foulwater sewers were treated on two occasions, prebait and poisoned bait being laid in the manholes and side entrances. In June 322 manholes and side entrances were baited and prebait takes recorded in 118. The figures for the December treatment were 212 manholes baited and prebait takes recorded in 162.
