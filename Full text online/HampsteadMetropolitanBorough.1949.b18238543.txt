There were 576 Pulmonary and 92 Non-Pulmonary cases of tuberculosis known to the Department at the end of the year 1949. Mass Miniature Radiography In February, 1949, arrangements were made for the Mass Radiography Unit to operate from Messrs. B. B. Evans & Co., Ltd., 142, Kilburn High Road, N.W.6. Twenty-nine local firms were circularised and 14 took advantage of the offer. Members of the Borough Council and the Day Nurseries staffs were X-rayed and altogether arrangements were made by this Department for 904 persons to attend. Bacteriological Examinations The following examinations were carried out:-Diphtheria, 67; Scarlet Fever (for Haem. Strep), 60; Vincents Angina, 12; Dysentery, 57; Food Poisoning, 11; Paratyphosus B, 7; Miscellaneous, 2. These services were carried out by the Laboratories of Pathology and Public Health, 6, Harley Street, W.1. The basis of payment is a comprehensive fee of £2 10s. per 1,000 inhabitants of the Borough per annum. Food Poisoning Eleven isolated cases of food poisoning were notified under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. These were investigated and where necessary samples of the suspected food were examined and appropriate action taken. The Agent causing the illness was identified in 2 cases, but was unknown in 9 cases. 7 Disinfection and Disinfestation The following is a record of the work carried out by the Disinfecting Staff during 1949:- Number of houses or parts of houses and contents disinfected 703 Number of verminous rooms disinfested 346 Cleansing and Disinfection of Verminous Persons and their Belongings The following cleansings and medicinal baths were carried out at the Borough Council Cleansing Centre, during the year, where 37 adults and 18 children received treatment:- Verminous conditions:- Adults. 18 Children under 5 8 Children over 5 8 Scabies:- Adults 44 Children under 5 3 Children over 5 20 During the year, 346 verminous rooms in 162 houses were cleansed and freed from vermin. 24 cases of scabies were notified during the year. These were investigated by the Health Visitors and, where necessary, treatment arranged at the Public Health Station. During the year, the following treatments were carried out at the Centre by staff of the London County Council:- Verminous conditions:- No. of school children treated 160 No. of treatments given 209 No. of pre-school children treated - No. of treatments given - Scabies:- No. of school children treated 6 No. of treatments given 18 No. of pre-school children treated - No. of treatments given - The decrease in the number of cases of scabies notified since the war continues, i.e.:- 1945 196 1946 197 1947 88 1948 36 1949 24 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 50 During the year 18 funerals were carried out under the National Assistance Act, 1948. In July the Council entered into an agreement with a firm of undertakers for the carrying out of all funerals or cremations in the Borough in those cases where no suitable private arrangements were being made. This agreement replaced the previous temporary arrangements with two firms of undertakers. 8 As from the 1st March, Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors were authorised to arrange the burial of persons dying in hospital, with the exception of certain cases in which the recovery of funeral expenses from a liable relative was involved. This considerably reduced the number of cases for which the Borough Council was responsible. The total cost of the funerals carried out during 1949 amounted to £118 17s. 6d., but an amount of £64 18s. 8d. was recovered during the year from liable relatives and the estates of deceased persons. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 47 Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention. Although it was not found necessary to operate the legal powers of removal and detention under the above-mentioned Act, many cases of acute distress amongst aged and infirm persons living alone have been reported as the result of visits by your Sanitary Inspectors. Owing to the severe shortage of accommodation some delay has been experienced in arranging for the voluntary reception of such cases into hospitals or homes. In the meantime everything possible is done to improve their circumstances. My thanks are due to all the local voluntary organisations who assisted with their services, including the provision of meals, etc. The services of the L.C.C. Home Helps are also enlisted and the L.C.C. gives every possible assistance with removals, despite difficulties caused by the above-mentioned shortage of accommodation. Outworkers In accordance with the Factories Act, 1937, 26 Hampstead firms sent in lists of persons employed as home workers. Of the 348 persons so employed, 65 resided in the Hampstead area. Information concerning 75 outworkers resident in Hampstead but employed by firms outside the Borough was received from other authorities. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 During the year 109 applications for the renewal of poisons licences were granted. In eight instances new licences were issued and five firms ceased to sell poisons. Inspection and Supervision of Food Hygiene of food and food premises. The undoubted growth of the feeling of public responsibility for the cleanliness of the food supply, ably sustained throughout the year by the Press, has naturally focussed attention upon this most important aspect of the work of the Department. Towards the end of the year the Ministry of Food issued Model Byelaws intended to secure the observance of sanitary and cleanlyconditions in the handling, wrapping and delivery of food and sale of food in the open air. The present L.C.C. Byelaws for the protection of food are undergoing revision in the light of the new Model Byelaws. The revised Byelaws, when issued, should materially assist in improving the standard of the cleanliness of food. Your Council, through their Public Health Committee, was among the prime movers in demonstrating to food handlers the potential dangers of food contamination and the paramount necessity for the observance of cleanliness in food production, handling and storage. As far back as January, 1948, a series of lectures and practical demonstrations on 9 food and drink infections was held and was attended by members of the food trades. This education in food hygiene has gradually extended, and during the year your Sanitary Inspectors have given talks and demonstrations, not only to food handlers but also to public bodies such as the Hampstead Chamber of Commerce, Hampstead Youth Council, and the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Stress has been laid in many quarters on the need for the establishment of a Food Guild in the Borough. Such Guilds have been established up and down the country with apparent success. Although entirely in favour of any organisation which will by friendly co-operative methods help to achieve the end desired by all parties-the production, sale and storage of clean food, I am of the opinion that our present system of sampling, inspections, talks and demonstrations by the Sanitary Inspectors "in the kitchen" and "on the spot" constitute a really serious and successful effort to protect the food supply. Any system of "certification" of food premises or the issuing of "hygiene badges" to food Guild members might conceivably give the public a false sense of security which would be rudely shattered in the event of food poisoning occurring at, presumably, "Grade A" premises. Number of Food Premises inspected. During the year visits were paid to food premises as follows:- Bakehouses 197 Butchers 330 Confectioners 120 Dairies and Milk Shops 168 Fishmongers 210 Fried Fish Shops 116 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 210 Grocers and Provision Shops 250 Hotels and Licensed Premises 180 Ice Cream Premises 306 Restaurants and Canteens 510 Other Food Premises 141 Other Inspections (Stalls, etc.) 206 Total 2,944 In addition, control has been maintained over 120 food stalls on Hampstead Heath on each of the four Bank Holidays, as a result of which recommendations have been made to the L.C.C. with a view to the re-siting of the food stalls and the provision of suitably placed water points on the Heath. Improved arrangements for the storage and collection of swill and waste have also been made following our recommendations. Summary of Improvements Achieved. As a result of the above-mentioned inspections, the following works have been carried out by the owners or occupiers of food premises:— Washing and Toilet, etc., Accommodation. (a) Lavatory basins with hot and cold water installed 101 (b) Soap and clean towels provided 106 (c) Extra sinks installed for food preparing purposes 99 (d) Additional W.C. accommodation provided 26 (e) Defective W.C. accommodation remedied 60 10 Cleaning and Repair. (a) Walls, ceilings, floors, windows and doors cleansed and/or repainted 231 Ventilation. (a) Ventilation provided or improved 40 Refuse. (a) Accumulations removed 60 (b) Proper storage provided 42 Contamination of Food. (a) Improvements to prevent risk of contamination effected 136 Public Health Nuisances. (a) Nuisances prejudicial to health abated 110 Licensing of Catering Establishments and Other Food Premises. Co-operation continues to exist between the Food Executive Committee and the Council. All new applications for licences or transfers of existing licences are referred to me so that any necessary improvements in the general hygienic conditions or the sanitary accommodation of the premises may be dealt with by the Sanitary Inspectors before such licences are granted. Sampling of Food Stuffs. (a) Chemical. Five hundred samples were taken for submission to your Public Analyst, Dr. H. E. Cox. Adulterated and Unsatisfactory Samples. The percentage of adulterated samples was again very small, 19 or 3.8 per cent. as compared with 4.6 per cent. in 1948 and 3.6 per cent. in 1947. Several of these were more or less venial offences. Particulars of the number classed as "adulterated" are as follows:— Case No. Name of Article. Offence. How dealt with. 31 Smoked Fish Roe Tin blown due to the action of the acid on the metal producing hydrogen. The contents are not decomposed or putrid but contain 3.2 grains per pound of tin. This exceeds the accepted limit of 2 grains per pound Stock surrendered and destroyed. Ministry of Food notified. 32 Cods Roe Spread Tin blown by reason of hydrogen. The amount of tin present is 1.8 grains per pound Small stock surrendered and destroyed. Ministry of Food notified. 89 Junket Rennet Contains trace of prohibited preservative—boric acid Retailer and manufacturer cautioned. 96 Tomato Puree Contains 50 parts per million of copper equal to 160 parts on the dry solids Retailer and manufacturer cautioned. 172 "Fulovit" This is a mixture of nuts and flour. There does not seem to be any evidence of vitamins Ministry of Food notified. 203 Home made Toffee This does not contain any fat. It consists only of heated sugar Vendor and manufacturer cautioned. 11 Case No. Name of Article. Offence. How dealt with. 207 Concentrated nonbrewed Vinegar This is a solution containing 57.8 per cent. acetic acid. It is improperly described as non-brewed vinegar Manufacturer cautioned. 266 Pears The sample of pears (informal) is substantially contaminated with arsenic. The amount present is about 15 parts per million on the skin All fruiterers instructed. 289 Ice Cream Fat content 1.08 per cent. Ministry of Food notified. 290 Ice Cream Fat content 1.73 per cent. Ministry of Food notified. 294 Pears The sample contains a quantity of copper arsenic on the skin but the amount on the sample as a whole is approximately 1 part per million Vendor cautioned. 329 Fruit Crisp Biscuits These biscuits contain no fruit nor any perceptible amount of fruit essence Manufacturer cautioned. 345 Beef Sausages Contains 220 parts per million sulphur dioxide. Preservative not declared Summons issued. Marylebone Police Court. Dismissed £3 3s. costs. 357 Sausages Total meat content 38 per cent. (Should contain at least 50 per cent. of meat.) Referred to Ministry of Food. 376 Tomato Paste, tinned The sample shows a concentration of 30.9 per cent. and the copper content is 140 p.p.m. on the dry basis. The amount of copper is rather too high Stock surrendered and destroyed. 400 Butter Scotch Contains only 0.8 per cent. butter fat Manufacturer cautioned. Ministry of Food notified. 433 Self-raising Flour The available carbon dioxide in this sample is 0.31 per cent. which is somewhat below the standard (0.45 per cent.) Vendor cautioned and remainder of stock withdrawn from sale. 445 Packet Gelatine Contains 2 parts per million arsenic (permitted limit 1.4 p.p.m.) Manufacturer and vendor cautioned. Stock withdrawn from sale. 480 Nut Cake Decorations This preparation consists wholly of dyed bread crumbs and contains no nut Manufacturer and vendor cautioned. (b) Bacteriological Examination of Foodstuffs. One hundred and forty-four samples were submitted to the Laboratories of Pathology and Public Health, 6, Harley Street, W.1. Of these 49 were in respect of Ice Cream which were graded under the Methylene Blue Test as follows:— Grade 1 31 Grade 2 5 Grade 3 8 Grade 4 5 Eight of the above ice cream samples were purchased on Hampstead Heath on Bank Holidays. Of these one was Grade 1, two Grade 2, two Grade 3 and three Grade 4. 12 It is hoped that when the hygienic improvements to the food stalls on the Heath, previously mentioned, are completed, there will be a substantial improvement on the above figures, although it must be borne in mind that in some cases contamination may have occurred on the makers' premises. Where Grade 3 and 4 ice creams are made outside the Borough, the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough concerned is notified. Fourteen samples of Pasteurised Milk satisfied both the Methylene Blue and Phosphatase Tests prescribed by the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations and the Heat Treated (Prescribed Tests) Order, 1944. Twenty-one samples were obtained for the purpose of assisting decisions of the Sanitary Inspectors with regard to suspected canned food stuffs. Thirteen samples were taken in an endeavour to trace the origin of suspected food poisoning cases, but all were found to be negative. Meat. No slaughtering is carried on in the Borough. Unsound Food.

Christmas Puddings 17 Sanitary Administration Much of the routine work of your Sanitary Inspectors, more or less totally interrupted by the war and subsequently slowed down by its aftermath of controls, licences and, in particular, housing problems, has, in some respects, reverted to more normal conditions. For example, the Council have always taken the keenest interest in the subject of Food Hygiene and this year it has been possible to commence a systematic inspection of the food premises throughout the Borough. This has resulted in substantial hygienic improvements being effected, generally speaking, with the utmost co-operation from the food traders themselves. With regard to Housing conditions, for the first time since 1937, a modified form of house-to-house survey has been made. Despite present difficulties, particularly the very high cost of building repairs in relation to controlled rents and the many aged, lease-expired premises in the Borough, the repairs section of the Housing Act, Section 9, has been utilised to an increasing extent. Much of the delay in complying with Sanitary Notices is due to the prolonged negotiations between property owners and the War Damage Commission regarding war damage claims. Owners are naturally reluctant to commence works without the authorisation of the Commission and although, strictly speaking, these claims have nothing whatever to do with the Council, we have successfully communicated with the Commission in many urgent instances, thus expediting the completion of the necessary works. The following important public health functions are the responsibility of the Local Authority and receive the close attention of your SanitaryInspectors :— General. Disinfestation. Drainage. 14 General. Factories. Houses let in Lodgings. Nuisances. Offensive Trades. Pharmacy and Poisons Registration. Rag Flock Regulations. Rats and Mice Destruction. Shops Act Inspection. Smoke Abatement. Food and Drugs. Bakehouses. Butter and Margarine Premises. Chemical Analysis and Bacteriological Examination of Food. Food Adulteration and Labelling. Fried Fish Vendors and Fish Curers. Hygiene of Food and Food Premises. Horseflesh Premises. Ice Cream Makers and Vendors. Inspection and Condemnation of Unsound Food. Meat Regulations. Preserved Food Manufacturers. Restaurants. Housing. Inspection of Individual Properties. Overcrowding. Surveys of Areas. Underground Rooms. Staff. Mr. Reginald Staples, Sanitary Inspector, resigned on the 23rd April, 1949, having secured an appointment in Northern Ireland. Mr. Kenneth F. Overy was appointed a temporary Sanitary Inspector and commenced duties on 1st February. He was subsequently appointed to the permanent staff on the 13th June, 1949. Mr. Maurice H. Parry commenced duty as a temporary Sanitary Inspector on the 27th June and resigned on the 31st December, 1949. Sanitary Circumstances of the Borough Sanitary Inspection.

Intimation Notices served 2,135 Statutory Notices served 701 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Nuisances under Public Health (London) Act, 1936. In 76 instances it was found necessary to refer outstanding Statutory Notices to the Town Clerk for the institution of legal proceedings. In the majority of these cases a warning letter from the Town Clerk had a salutary effect, the necessary works being executed and the notices complied with. In 15 instances, however, police court proceedings had to be instituted; of these 9 were subsequently withdrawn or adjourned sine die, the works having been completed; in 4 cases Abatement Orders were obtained and, in the remaining 2 cases, further proceeding swere taken for noncompliance with Court Abatement Orders. A total of £5 lines was imposed by the Magistrates and £11 11s. costs awarded to the Council. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938 One summons was issued respecting the sale of beef sausages contrary to Article 4, Public Health (Preservatives, etc., in Food) Regulations and the Food and Drugs Act. The Defendant was discharged absolutely and ordered to pay £3 3s. costs. As a result of alleged contraventions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, the Public Health Committee authorised the issue of nine summonses against the proprietors and manager of a food shop in the Borough in respect of the condicion of the shop premises and of food and apparatus thereat. The summonses were dismissed by the Magsitrate sitting at the Marylebone Magistrates Court and costs were awarded against the Council. The decision of the Court disposed of the matter, but in view of the award of costs, the General Purposes Committee reviewed in detail the circumstances in which these proceedings were started and the course which they took, and reported to the Council that they were satisfied that they were reasonably and properly brought and that the action of the Council and its officers was in no way open to criticism. 16 Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts No certificate was issued during the year. Housing (1) Total number of dwelling-houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 2,311 (2) Number of dwelling-houses (included in (1) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 and 1932 69 (3) Number of dwelling-houses found to be in a state so gerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 8 (4) Number of dwelling-houses found not to be in all respects fit for human habitation 1,807 Action under statutory powers during the year. (a) Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1936:- (i) Dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs 6 (ii) Dwelling-houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices 2 (In one case the work was executed by the Council, in default of the owner, at a cost of £340.) (b) Proceedings under Public Health Acts:— (i) Dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 1,807 (ii) Dwelling-houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices:— (a) By owners 1,760 (b) By local authority in default of owners Nil (c) Proceedings under Sections 11 and 13 of the Housing Act, 1936:— (i) Dwelling-houses in respect of which demolition orders were made Nil (ii) Dwelling-houses demolished in pursuance of tion orders Nil (d) Proceedings under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936:— (i) Separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which closing orders were made 7 (ii) Separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which closing orders were determined the tenements or rooms having been rendered fit Nil I must reiterate the position as regards the large number of dwellinghouses in the Borough which are not up to a reasonable standard of fitness. I have previously reported that "the cumulative effect of war damage, the lack of elementary maintenance work during and after the war years, the difficulties of obtaining building labour and materials, and high costs generally, had resulted in a large amount of deterioration and dilapidations in dwelling houses in the Borough." I stressed also the additional complication, particularly in the Adelaide and Priory Wards, of large numbers of dilapidated premises where the leases had either expired or had only very few years to run. 17 The urgent need of new homes obviously overshadows the problem of the many unfit, lease-expired, basement dwellings in the Borough; nevertheless, the condition of such premises is a cause of increasing concern from the health point of view. The Provision of Housing Accommodation. During the year no less than 577 housing applications were referred to my department for a Sanitary Inspector's report as to the urgency of the case. These reports were supplied not only to our own Housing Estates Department but also to the London County Council and other Local Authorities, from whom enquiries were received. A large number of housing applicants base their claims primarily on insanitary conditions, and appropriate action is taken by the service of sanitary notices where the complaints are well founded. The Housing Estates Manager of the Council has supplied me with the following information:— (a) Total number of families rehoused by the Council from 1st January, 1941, to 31st December, 1949 2,452 (b) Total number of families housed during 1949 291 (c) Number of prefabricated dwellings 80 (d) Hutted camps. I am glad to be able to report that all the hutments at Primrose Hill have been demolished. (e) Requisitioned properties. The Council hold 501 properties, comprising 1,574 dwellings under requisition. Four properties comprising 21 dwellings are in the process of conversion. During 1949, 48 extra dwellings were provided in requisitioned properties. (f) New Housing Estates. During 1949, progress was made in the provision of new housing schemes as follows:— Parkhill Road. By the end of 1948, 19 flats were completed and the remaining 73 flats were completed and occupied during the early part of 1949. The dwellings are arranged in two terraces, each of 46 flats, on the Parkbill Road and Upper Park Road frontages, with a garden between. The terraces have been named Wood Field and Barn Field respectively, thus reviving the names of fields originally in this locality. The new estate was officially opened by Councillor the Hon. John Fremantle, L.C.C., Chairman of the Housing Committee, on 23rd April, 1949. Well Walk. At the end of the year, this scheme was nearing completion, 49 of the flats being completed and let, and the remaining 15 requiring only the finishing touches. This attractive scheme was approved by the Fine Arts Commission. Burgh House, a building of architectural merit, has been preserved on the site and will be used for cultural and communal purposes. The estimated cost of the land and buildings is £171,000. The new flats have been named The Wells House, to preserve the old associations of the site. King Henry's Road and Kilburn Priory. Building work continued throughout 1949 on the 102 flats at King Henry's Road and 60 flats at Kilburn Priory. Construction is now well 18 advanced in both Schemes and although the contract dates of completion are November and December, 1950, some of the flats will be ready in advance of these dates. The estimated cost of the land and buildings at King Henry's Road is £237,000, and at Kilburn Priory, £144,000. West End Lane. By the end of the year all preparatory work in connection with this Scheme (80 flats) was completed, and building work was about to commence. The estimated cost of the land and buildings is £181,000. Additional schemes in various preparatory stages are:— Broadhurst Gardens 168 flats. Shoot-up Hill 112 flats. Lawn Road 25 flats. Agamemnon Road 8 houses. Primrose Hill Road 116 flats. Total 429 dwellings. Other housing sites have received preliminary consideration. FLOODING BY STORM WATER Since the completion of the sewer relief works early in the year, it is gratifying to report that no complaints have been received of flooded basements, particularly in those areas such as Sumatra Road and Netherwood Street formerly subject to severe inundation. During the year we have not experienced a rainstorm of comparable intensity to those causing the worst of the previous floodings, and although the relief works have been designed to secure a more equable distribution of storm water throughout the sewers of the Borough which will reduce the risk of flooding in the present danger areas, it is again emphasised by the Borough Engineer that these works cannot be regarded as a remedy for all flooding.

Water. The Borough's water supply is provided entirely by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. No complaint of contamination was received. All the dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied from public water mains direct to the houses. There are no wells or stand pipes. Bath Waters. Samples of water were regularly taken from the Hampstead Swimming Baths. These proved to be satisfactory. Rodent Control. Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1919. Rats and Mice Infestation Order, 1943. B. Matthews, foreman rat-catcher, perhaps better known as Hampstead's "Pearly King," retired on superannuation after a lifetime of service with the Borough Council. He was transferred to the Public Health Department from the Highways Department on the inception of the Infestation Order, 1943. Matthews was a very experienced " Pied Piper " and well known to all old Hampstead residents. There are now two full-time rat catchers employed by the Borough. The number of complaints of rodents received during the year was 597, of which 290 related to rats and 307 to mice. Complaints relating to mice are increasing. As part of a campaign embracing the whole country, the sewers were treated on two occasions in January and June, a total of 1,236 manholes being prebaited and poison baited. 20 Records for each treatment were tabulated as follows:— January. June. (1) Bait and poison used—2½ per cent. zinc phosphide, 4 ozs. sausage rusk. (2) Number of manholes baited 602 634 (3) Number of manholes showing prebait take 463 454 (4) Number of manholes showing complete prebait take (on one or both days) 189 132 (5) Estimated kill (vide Ministry of Agriculture formula) 2,175 1,955 This work is carried out by the Borough Engineer's staff assisted by the two rat-catchers. The total number of visits paid to premises by the rat-catchers was 2,360. In addition, visits are paid by the Sanitary Inspectors to those premises where infestation may be due to faulty drains and the necessary tests are made. The Sanitary Inspectors are also responsible for serving notices in respect of any necessary rat-proofing of premises, chicken houses, etc., and giving advice to residents on these matters.
