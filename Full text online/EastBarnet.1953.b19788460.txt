Medical Officer of Health to the Council TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF W. K. PICKUP, M.R.San.I. Chief Sanitary Inspector Cast Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTIETH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1953. To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1953. The opportunity has been taken to redraft the form of the report in the belief that it will give a more complete picture of the Health and Sanitary conditions of the area. Special attention is drawn to the work done under the general heading of Food Hygiene and all cases of illness possibly due to infected food have been thoroughly investigated. It can be said that Food Hygiene is carefully observed throughout the area. In the coming year a further drive is contemplated on this subject. Housing still remains our greatest problem and the utmost endeavour is being made to obtain rehousing for those families living under insanitary conditions. At the same time, other houses are being continuously repaired to ensure that they do not deteriorate more than is inevitable in the course of time. It is worthy of note that, with the willing co-operation of the Housing Committee, five families from the special tuberculosis list have been rehoused, but 3 I am still not satisfied that medical reasons are given sufficient extra points on the rehousing list, and this belief is being constantly pressed. There is a steadily increasing number of personal callers at the department asking for advice on various health and sanitary problems, as well as the usual number calling to register complaints. These callers have, I believe, in the majority been satisfied with the help and advice they have received and the public relations activities have become an increasing part of the department's duties. My most sincere thanks to all members of my staff for their usual untiring patience and perseverance throughout the year, and to the Chief Officers and staff of other departments of the Council for their help and co-operation in all problems put to them by the Public Health Department.

Totals 22 16 1 4 3 ' 3 1 — 8 ANALYSIS OF VITAL STATISTICS 1. The estimated population for 1953 is 40,670, which shows a slight decrease of 110 on 1952 figures. 2. The number of live births during the year is practically the same as in 1952, being 494 as compared with 492. The birth rate is 12.7, this being 0.6 higher than 1952. This increase is due to the slight decrease in population offset against a small increase in birth, together with a variation in the Comparability Rates. The rate is considerably below that for England and Wales and for towns of a similar size. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 23.1 is lower than that for the rest of England and Wales by 3.7 and for similar areas of population by 1.2. It is considerably higher than 1952, which was 14.6. That year, however, was exceptionally low, the previous year being 20.3. The death rate of illegitimate infants under 1 year per 1,000 illegitimate births give an exceptionally high figure of 111.1. This, however, is a case in which small figures produce false conclusions and arises from the fact that out of 9 illegitimate births there was 1 death. 4. The death rate shows a slight decrease on 1952, being 91 as compared with 9.3. The number of actual deaths were 351, which is 20 less than the previous year. 5. The number of deaths from cancer was 73, which is the same as the previous year. The deaths from tuberculosis were 7 against 8 in 1952. 6. There were 43 new cases of tuberculosis during the year as compared with 40 cases in 1952. During the year the Mass Radiography unit visited the district and 4,090 persons were X-rayed. Of this number 1.3 per centre, we found to require further investigation. This work is extremely important in the detection of T.B. and will considerably assist in the control of this disease by early diagnosis. 7. There were 1,528 cases of infectious diseases in the district as compared with 558 cases in 1952. The greater majority of these were chicken pox, whooping cough and measles. The table clearly shows that the age groups up to 10 years are by far the most susceptible and emphasises the prevalence of measles and whooping cough. All cases of scarlet fever, dysentery and food poisoning were visited by the Sanitary Inspectors and details of the case history obtained. In the cases of food poisoning and dysentery, samples of food stuff and specimens were obtained for laboratory examination as necessary. 9 Water The water which is obtained from deep wells sunk into the chalk is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company. The Company have an up-to-date clinical and bacteriological laboratory in charge of which is a qualified chemist. During the year 1,293 examinations were made, 98.0 per cent, being B. coli free in 100 ml. Twelve samples were also taken by us and submitted for examination to the Public Health laboratory. The reports were in every case satisfactory. 10 Cast Barnet Urban District Council ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR 1953 To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present my second report to the Council. Redrafting of the form of the report has been carried out as mentioned by the Medical Officer of Health and I hope will meet with approval. The total number of visits and the amount of work carried out varies very little year by year, but the distribution of these visits over the various headings alters slightly owing to the nature of the complaints received. An effort is made to ensure that whatever variations may take place in other subjects that the visits to the food premises are maintained at a high level. This year twelve houses have been represented to the Council under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, as unfit houses, incapable of being rendered fit at a reasonable expense. This does not represent an active start on the housing problem, but consists of those dwellings which normal routine brought to light and where action was unavoidable. The Housing (Repairs and Rents) Bill states that a survey of the housing conditions of the district shall be made and a report of those conditions together with suggested action submitted to the Minister within one year of the passing of the bill. The carrying out of the details of the provision will ensure that the problem of sub-standard houses is vigorously tackled during the following year. During 1954 the Council will become a Food and Drugs and Shops Act authority which will cause considerable additional work for the Public Health department. This, combined with the extra duties under the Housing (Repairs and Rents) Bill when it becomes law, will probably require an increase in the staff of the department, if standards in other fields are to be maintained. In conclusion I wish to tender my thanks to other officers of the Council and members of the staff for assistance and co-operation throughout the year. W. K.

This number compares with previous years, there being approximately a similar amount of visits paid under this class, although the distribution is slightly different. Nuisances and Sanitary Defects The visits paid under this heading being 4,860 are those mainly resulting from complaints and inspections made relating to those complaints, including re-inspections of Notices which have been served. The majority of these complaints deal with defects in living accommodation which were of such a nature that they could be dealt with under the Public Health Act, 1936. It will be seen from the Table listing the Notices served that the total number served during the year is less than the previous year, although the number which have been complied with compares favourably, as do amounts of improvements effected to various dwellings, as may be seen from the list dealing with this matter. Infectious Diseases and Food Poisoning The number of visits made under this heading is considerably higher than last year, although the amount of notified infectious disease visited by the Sanitary Inspectors is less. The cause of this increase is undoubtedly due to more frequent re-inspections made in the case of notified infectious diseases and in particular visits being paid to suspected cases of food poisoning which have been reported. 15 During November a report was received that several cases of illness with symptoms of food poisoning had occurred at a business premises. On enquiries being made, it was found that 22 employees were ill or had been ill. Apparently all the employees who were ill had eaten at the works canteen on the previous day. Samples of food, specimens, etc., were taken and sent to the pathologists for examination. Arrangements were made for visits to be made to all persons away from the normal work. The illnesses were of short duration and recovery was at a maximum of 48 hours. The majority of the reports from the pathologists showed negative, but in one case a food poisoning organism (Clostridium Welchii) was isolated. The clinical symptoms of the illness showed a marked similarity to the symptoms this organism would have caused. Every effort was made to trace the cause of the illness, no definite conclusions were reached. The cause of the outbreak was probably a pre-cooked meat dish which had been re-heated. Especially as the dish had been stored in a cupboard all night, no refrigeration being available. Advice was given on the storage of food and the lack of adequate facilities for the keeping of cooked food was stressed. Subsequently a refrigerator was installed. Up to the present time no further reports of cases have been received from these premises. Smoke Observations It will be noticed that considerably more visits were made in connection with observation of smoke from factory chimneys than previously. The cause of this being several complaints that were received from ratepayers regarding smoke and grit. The matter was very thoroughly investigated and has since been kept under observation. While no statutory nuisance was found, co-operation was received from the owners of the factory; considerable alterations and repair work were carried out in an attempt to obviate the cause. Regarding the rest of the visits made under this main heading, they are normal routine inspections which follow the pattern of other years. HOUSING At the beginning of the year to which this report refers there were three outstanding Demolition Orders, these being:— 54, Edward Road, New Barnet—Order served February, 1952. 107, Leicester Road, New Barnet—Order served November, 1949. 16 14, Warwick Cottages, New Barnet—Order served November, 1949. No. 54, Edward Road, was vacant prior to 1953, and both 107, Leicester Road, and 14, Warwick Cottages, became vacant during the year, but none of these premises has yet been demolished. In the period under review, twelve properties were reported to the Council as being unfit for human habitation and incapable of being rendered fit at reasonable expense. In 5 of these cases either Demolition or Closing Orders were served upon the owners. In one case an undertaking to carry out works to place the premises in a reasonably fit state for habitation was accepted by the Council, and in the other 6 cases the matters have not yet been decided. The six cases in which action was taken are as follows:— 8, Lyonsdown Road, New Barnet (basement flat)—Closing Order. 113, Lancaster Road, New Barnet—Demolition Order. 115, Lancaster Road, New Barnet—Demolition Order. 117, Lancaster Road, New Barnet—Demolition Order. 119, Lancaster Road, New Barnet—Demolition Order. 10, Warwick Cottages, New Barnet—Undertaking received and accepted. 8, LYONSDOWN ROAD, NEW BARNET This flat was severely affected by damp and considerable works were required to render it habitable. The Closing Order came into effect 4th May, 1953, and since that date the occupiers have been re-housed. 113, 115, 117 and 119, LANCASTER ROAD, NEW BARNET These premises are a block of four houses, brick built with slate roofs. They are generally dilapidated and damp and have slight subsidence. The Demolition Orders were served in October, 1953, and it has not yet been possible for the occupants to find alternative accommodation, consequently further action is not yet practicable. 10, WARWICK COTTAGES The owner of these premises submitted to the Council an undertaking to carry out works to place the premises in a reasonably fit state of habitation, which the Council have accepted. A period of six months was allowed for the work to be carried out. The property was vacant at the date at which it was reported to the Committee and consequently the question of re-housing the tenants did not arise. The period in which the work is to be carried out does not expire until June, 1954. The matter, therefore, is in abeyance until this date or until the work is carried out. 17 FOOD HYGIENE The work of carrying out routine inspection to various food premises was continued throughout this year and 2,154 visits were made to food premises for this purpose. The standard of cleanliness in the premises throughout the district has continued to be high. Although the number of actual Notices served for the redecoration, cleansing or other defects has been low, it is essential that these visits shall be continued in order to maintain the personal contact with the proprietors and managers of premises dealing in food. In all cases it has been found that the persons in charge of these establishments are willing to co-operate and show keen interest in hygiene. More modern equipment both for refrigeration and cold display cabinets have been installed. The feature during the last year has been the number of premises which are now selling frozen foods. Milk Supply The following licences were granted to dealers to sell under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1936-1949:— Tuberculin Tested 6 Pasteurised 8 Sterilised 12 The following Supplementary licences under principal licences granted by other authorities to sell milk from premises outside this area were also granted:— Tuberculin Tested 12 Pasteurised 13 Sterilised 10 Ninety-three samples of milk were purchased and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Ministry of Health's Emergency Public Health Laboratory, at Hertford. The following is a summary of the results of the examinations:— No. of Samples Submitted Test applied:— Result of Examination. Satisfactory (a) Methylene blue. (b) Turbidity (c) Phosphatase. T.T. Pasteurised 15 (a) and (c) T.T. Farm Bottled 18 (a) „ Pasteurised 30 (a) and (c) „ Homogenised Past. 10 (a) and (c) „ Sterilised 20 (b) „ 18 A copy of the report of each sample was supplied to the retailer or dairy proprietor. For the last four years no sample of milk has been found to be unsatisfactory. The continued satisfactory reports of the milk supply are evidence that the milk has continued to be handled with care. The samples are taken from roundsmen who have no previous knowledge of the time of sampling, and in consequence are genuine samples of the milk being supplied to the public. In the last Annual Report the Medical Officer stressed that the greatest danger as far as milk is concerned is after the retailer has delivered the milk to the consumer, who frequently leaves the full bottles in direct rays of the sun for long periods. It has been noticed that this practice is still very common and is undoubtedly the cause of complaints of souring. Probably the entire blame cannot be laid against the housewife who, in these days when a large percentage of wives are working away from home, the milk is delivered at the front door by the roundsman and left by him in an exposed position. Ice Cream Six applications were received for the registration of premises for the sale of ice cream. The premises being satisfactory, all six applications were granted. Ninety-six samples were obtained and submitted for bacteriological examination, with the following results:— Provisional grade 1 84 2 9 ,, ,, 3 1 ,, „ 4 2 96 Although during the year one sample was graded 3 and two were graded 4, the high standard of handling has generally been maintained. In the case of the sample grade 3 and one of the samples graded 4, no reason for the lapse could be found even after careful inspection of the premises in which the ice cream was stored. The manufacturers concerned were communicated with and they checked the supplies which were apparently satisfactory. Subsequent samples from the same retailers gave satisfactory results. The second grade 4 sample was traced to a refrigerator failure at the manufacturer's factory. During the failure the ice cream in the refrigerator became un-frozen and was subsequently re-frozen and issued to retailers. This action was the cause of the bad result on sampling. Other authorities besides ourselves were affected in this case and the matter was taken up by the authority in which the 19 manufacturer's premises were situated. No further trouble has been experienced. The only person registered in this district to manufacture ice cream has not during the year produced any ice cream. This manufacturer produces ice cream only very occasionally and then only in small quantities. All the other retailers purchase their supplies from large manufacturers. Samples were taken during the year of iced lollies which were found to be quite satisfactory from bacteriological standards. As far as is known only one person makes iced lollies on their premises which have been carefully inspected. A high standard is maintained and great care is paid to the cleanliness of the equipment. In addition to the visits made for the purpose of sampling, regular inspections are made of all ice-cream retailers, especially during the summer months. Refrigerators and serving utensils where loose ice cream is sold are carefully inspected for cleanliness. Meat and Other Food Inspections The requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, have been carried out as regards all premises on which meat is sold for human consumption. The inspection of food (other than meat) is carried out as necessary. As may be seen from the Table of foods during the year, a total amount of over 40 cwts. of food of various types was condemned as unfit for human consumption. Co-operation between this office and the retailers of food continues to be extremely good and no difficulties have been experienced in this connection. FACTORIES During the year 499 visits have been made to factories and outworkers in the district for the purpose of the Factories Acts, 1937. It was found necessary to serve nine Notices in connection with these premises, all of which have been complied with. The general condition of the factories as far as the Section which the local authority are responsible for under the Factories Act is reasonable and, as may be seen from the small number of Notices which have been served, the number of contraventions which are found is extremely low. INFESTATIONS Rodent Control Two hundred and seventy-four complaints of rat and mouse infestations were received during the year. In order that these 20 complaints could be efficiently dealt with, a total of 685 properties were visited, and 305 of these were found to be infested with rats or mice. All the infested properties were treated by the Rodent Operator. The majority of the infestations treated during the year have been of a minor character and treatments have in general been successful. In a few cases difficulty has been experienced, but by re-treatment and variations of both poisoning and bait satisfactory results have been obtained. The usual poisons, zinc phosphide, arsenic and red squill have been employed in the majority of cases. Continued use of warfarin has shown that it is very effective in certain cases and has advantages over other poisons where pre-baiting is not possible. In accordance with the requirements of the Rodent Control Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture, two treatments of the sewers were made. The first in January being a maintenance treatment and the second in July being the annual 10 per cent, test of the sewer manholes, followed by a treatment based on the results of the test. The maintenance treatment of the sewers which was carried out in January consisted of prebaiting 42 manholes with sausage rusk. These manholes being those which showed "takes" at previous treatments, with the addition of manholes in the immediate vicinity. Of the manholes prebaited 12 showed "takes," these were subsequently poison-baited with sausage rusk and zinc phosphide. Two days after laying the poison it was found that in 10 cases the bait had been partially consumed. During the annual 10 per cent, test of the sewer manholes in July, 160 manholes were baited with damp sausage rusk, and on an inspection being made two days later in 9 cases the bait had been completely taken and in 5 cases partially taken. This test was followed by a treatment in which 53 manholes were prebaited, consisting of those in which bait was partially or completely taken and those in the immediate vicinity. Twenty-four of these manholes showed "takes," these being poison baited when 15 partial "takes" were found. There were no complete "takes" of poison bait. From the above result it is indicated that the sewers of the area are not seriously rat infested. Insect Control The number of complaints that are being received regarding infestations by various types of insects, not necessarily fleas and bugs, is increasing. In these cases assistance and advice are given and where necessary insecticides are supplied free of charge. The number of verminous premises which have been treated during the year is extremely low, and the existence of fleas and bugs in houses in this area is now rare. 21
