ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1951 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Chingford Corporation. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Report for the year 1951 upon the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough. The population of the Borough was 48,330, the figure recorded at the time of the census in April, 1951, The following points in regard to vital statistics are of interest; the birth rate showed a further decline to 12,2 per thousand, the lowest figure ever recorded for the district. The death rate at 8,7 per thousand was slightly higher than the previous year. The infant mortality rate, i.e. the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per thousand live births, rose sharply to 23.7. I pointed out in my report for 1950 that the figure for that year, viz: 11,6 was a record low figure for the district. In any one year there has always been a hard-core of infant deaths due to such causes as prematurity, congenital deformities and failure to survive the stresses and strains of birth; the number of. such deaths will vary from year to year and will naturally cause considerable fluctuation in the infant mortality rate. The table on page 37 illustrates this point. In the matter of infectious diseases, the year saw a great increase in the incidence of measles and whooping cough in the Borough. This rise in incidence was also general throughout the whole country. I am very pleased to be able to report that there were no cases of diphtheria nor poliomyelitis. An outbreak of dysentery occurred in the early part of the year, in which one of the Day Nurseries was involved in addition to cases occurring among the general public: the administrative measures which suppressed the outbreak in the Nursery and allowed it to remain open are described in the text. The problem of the care of the aged continues to cause considerable anxiety. Several persons who were aged, infirm and unable to take care of themselves were referred to me by general practitioners and others during the year. I dislike having to take action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, in such cases: this section empowers me to obtain a court order to have them compulsorily removed to hospital or other place where they will receive care and 3. attention: so far, I have not had to invoke these powers as I was able to persuade the more urgent cases to enter hospital voluntarily. In the other instances the provision of a Home Help met the situation as a temporary measure. During the year several lectures and film shows dealing with Clean Food were given to organised associations. I am much indebted to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and co-operation during the year and to the Area Medical Officer for the statistical information in regard to those services provided by the Essex County Council. To the Chief Sanitary Inspector, Mr. J.F. Rogers, and the Staff of the Health Department I tender my sincere thanks for their hard work and assistance during the year, I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J.H. CROSBY, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1952. 4. SECTION A.

SECTION C SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supplies A hard, pure and constant piped water supply is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board; the supply has been satisfactory in both quality and quantity. No samples of drinking water were submitted for bacterial examination during the year. Rivers and Streams Fifteen visits were paid during the year in connection with the pollution of water courses, and six visits were largely in reference to minor pollutions of the Council's surface water sewers due to incorrect connections of sanitary fittings. In all instances the necessary adjustments were made and pollutions prevented. Public Cleansing A weekly collection of refuse and salvage was maintained and the total weight of refuse disposed of at the Works was 11,584 tons. This was a slight decrease over the amount collected in the previous year, namely 11,849 tons. The fifteenth census of the population of England and Wales was taken on the 8th April, 1951 and the results which were published in June of that year showed that the population of the Borough was 48,330. This figure was somewhat below the Registrar General's estimated figure for the previous year, namely 48,770. The year under review was a remarkable one in relation to the collection and disposal of salvage. Income was at such a high level that not only were disposal costs, including loan charges, completely covered but there remained a credit balance on the refuse disposal service account of Â£865. In the history of the Borough this has only occurred once beforefor the year ended March, 1943 when there was a credit balance of Â£276. Whilst it is only right to report that economic conditions favoured the relatively easy disposal of salvage at high prices, much credit is due to the staff, both in the refuse collection and disposal services, for the zeal and enthusiasm displayed during this year. The net cost per ton for the collection of refuse was 23s.10d as against 19s.5d for the year ended March 1951 and 18s.4d for the year ended March 1950. Although unit costs are higher in respect to this service this is due to certain wage awards and a considerably higher amount of commission paid, but it should be appreciated that the income from the sale of salvaged articles is credited to the disposal service and the beneficial results of the high salvage returns are reflected in the net expenditure for the whole service. No additional staff were employed in the collection of house refuse and salvage. 12. Net expenditure for the collection and disposal of refuse and salvage, including loan charges, was Â£12,963 or 22s.5d per ten as against Â£16,511 or 27s,10d per ton for the previous year. The total income from all sources was Â£14,144 as compared with Â£7,009 for the previous year. Once again the largest income was received for the sale of newsprint and mixed waste papers and in the light of conditions prevailing in the year 1952 it is doubtful whether the high prices paid by the Mills for this class of material during the year under review were really justified. One innovation which proved highly successful was the sorting out and the sale of woollens; just over 3 tons of woollens were sold at Â£300 per ton and the experiment was fully justified. The following extract from a report by the Borough Treasurer shows the percentage increases in weight and'value in the year 1951/52 over 1950/51 in the main sources of salvage:- Weight Value Paper 2% 124% Ferrous Metals 14% 292% Non-Ferrous Metals 31% 61% Bottles and Jars 155% 172% Cullet 17% 17% Textiles 36% 216% The fleet of refuse collection freighters was maintained in good condition throughout the year; two new Harrier vehicles were acquired and the two Fordson freighters became redundant. The fleet comprises six Karrier 10 cubic yard side-loading vehicles and one 10 cubic yard Shelvoke and Drewry freighter. Street cleansing was maintained under difficulties during the year. The efficiency of the Lewin Road Sweeper was impaired during the year not only by reason of staff changes and absences through sickness but also by reason of the fact that the machine itself had to undergo a.major overhaul. It is now reasonably clear that any form of mechanical sweeper can only be an adjunct to the normal manual service provided by street orderlies. Further, any scheme is prone to disturbance which has to rely on only one machine being maintained in a constant state of efficiency. Nevertheless, in spite of the difficulties mentioned, the general condition of the streets was satisfactory. Road gullies were cleansed by contract as in previous years, those gullies in main roads being cleansed four times per year and those in district roads twice per year. The public sanitary conveniences were maintained in good condition throughout the year. The Council had under consideration during the year the provision of a new convenience near the Royal Forest Hotel in order to adequately cater for the influx of visitors at holiday times, and also an additional sanitary convenience at Chingford Hatch to serve the London County Council Estate. 13.

During the year under review a considerable amount of time and energy was expended by officers of the Department in relation to the emission of effluvia from a factory in the Borough. The emissions were such as to be considered by the Public Health Committee a nuisance to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood and formal notice was served on the Company to abate the nuisance under Section 93 of the Public Health Act, 1936. The factory premises from which the effluvia emanated were used for the manufacture of a patent constructional unit, either in steel or in alloy, and in the case of the former material protection by painting became necessary in order to prevent oxidization. This protection was achieved by submitting the material to three initial processes following which the slotted angle or shelving was dipped in paint which contained a high proportion of driers. The subsequent processes involved the drying and stoving of the finished product. The proprietors of the factory unsuccessfully made many efforts to abate the nuisance and in addition they stated that new factory premises outside the area of the Borough had been acquired and that ultimately the offending processes would be removed entirely. At the end of the year 1951 the Council was satisfied that the nuisance still continued and authority was given to institute proceedings. At this stage the Council called in the services of a Consultant Chemist and after investigation of the processes and analysis of the jaint he reported that this had a methyl-methacrylate thermoplastic base. When heated this paint base would give off a considerable amount of acrolein which has a most penetrating and disagreeable odour. In addition there was also the possible discharge into the atmosphere of xylene, trichlorethylene and other substances. The case came before the local Magistrates in January, 1952 when Defending Counsel informed the Bench they had called in the services of a firm of noted Chemical Engineers and that they were at that time experimenting with one of three processes which had been recommended. By agreement between the two parties and with the approval of the Magistrates the hearing was adjourned for three months. Before the case came up for hearing again, however, the firm had removed the painting processes to a factory outside the Borough boundary, the painting tanks were dismantled and the nuisance thereby abated in the best possible way to the Council and to those residents who had found cause to complain. 20. Shops Act, 1950 The inspection of all shops was completed during the year under review. A total of 545 visits was paid and generally conditions were found to be satisfactory. Smoke Abatement Nine observations were taken of a chimney stack, particularly with regard to grit emission, and subsequently a water-trap type grit arrestor was installed. Swimming Pool Summaries of the total chlorine and alkalinity readings are forwarded weekly to the Health Department by the Pool Superintendent. The Pool was opened on the 19th May and closed on the 9th September, 1951. Once again vagaries of the weather detracted from the full use of this very delightful open-air Swimming Pool. The total attendance throughout the season numbered 112,559, the highest attendance being on the 22nd July when 4,901 persons were present. Samples of water were taken from the Pool during the months of May, June, July and August, five samples in all, and the results in each case were to the effect that the water was of a high standard of bacterial purity, suitable for bathing purposes. Schools The general condition and supply of water to Schools has been satisfactory during the year. Co-operation was continued with the School Medical Officer and reports were forwarded to that Officer following quarterly visits paid to the canteens attached to all Schools. During the year the rate of progress of the execution of necessary works and improvements was expedited. Offensive Trades Within the meaning of the Public Health Act there are no offensive trade premises in the district, but there are 10 fish fryers. Bakehouses Forty visits were paid to the eight bakehouses in the district and generally they were maintained in a satisfactory condition. In another section of this report, dealing with action taken under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, six cases involved food which had been prepared in bakehouses, but only in one instance were the premises situated within the Borough. Factories Act, 1937 One hundred and eighty-six visits were paid to Factories, and in 8 instances action was taken to secure improvements in cleanliness and ventilation of sanitary accommodation. 21.

INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Milk Supply The milk supply is from several large firms with dairy premises outside the Borough boundaries, and is mainly pasteurised. Seven samples of milk were analysed during the year and all were certified to be genuine. Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949 Graded Milks. The following table shows the licences granted during the year for the sale of milk under the special designations, as provided by the above Regulations: 3 dealers' licences to sell milk as Pasteurised. 5 dealers' licences to sell milk as Sterilised. 3 supplementary licences to sell milk as Sterilised. 2 supplementary licences to sell milk as Pasteurised. 3 dealers' licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested. 1 supplementary licence to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested, Food and Drugs Act, 1938 Food and Drugs Authority The Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the district and during the year samples approximating in number to two per thousand of the population were taken and submitted to the joint Public Analysts, Public Analyst 25- Mr. George Taylor F.R.I.C., 20, Eastcheap, London, E.C.3. and. Dr. J.H. Hamence, F.R.I.C., 20, Eastcheap, London, E.C.J, continued as joint Public Analysts for the area. Samples Subnitted for Analysis One hundred and nineteen samples of foods and drugs were submitted for analysis, twenty-seven formal and ninety-two informal and it will be seen by the following table that a reasonably wide field was covered The Public Analysts were consulted from time to time as to interpretation of analytical results and generally with regard to the type of samples submitted. The table shows that in seven instances samples were adversely reported upon and in one case proceedings were instituted as to the mouldy condition of meat patties. Of the seventeen samples of sausages analysed one informal sample was certified to be 4.6 deficient in meat content. A follow-up formal sample was taken which proved to be genuine. One.informal sample of dried mixed herbs was certified to contain sand highly in excess of that ordinarily found in that product, indicating that the herbs had been insufficiently cleaned. A formal sample from the same source gave a genuine result. One sample of medicated mint tablets was analysed following a complaint made to the office. The Public Analyst reported that the tablets had a calcium carbonate base and as the mints were described as "medicated" the use of this base was justified, but this active constituent was not stated on the label. The matter was taken up with the manufacturers who expressed surpise that these mints were still being sold as it was more than two years since the manufacture was discontinued. One local trader sought advice of the Department with regard to a small stock of red cherries in sugar syrup and on the sample being submitted for analysis the Analyst certified that the sulphur dioxide preparation in the cherries was breaking down yielding sulphur compounds, thu3 producing discolouration of the cherries and tin. In view of this objectionable condition the Analyst recommended that the cherries should not be used for human consumption and the trader was notified accordingly. One informal sample of malt extract with cod-liver oil, which was unused owing to the presence of what appeared to be a compacted mould growth, was procured from an Essex County Council Clinic. Microscopic examination by the Public Analyst, however, showed that the top layer consisted not of mould growth but of a crystallised mass produced by drying out of the preparation. The oil in the sample was not rancid but having regard to the obvious effect of storage of the contents the Analyst reported that it was no longer suitable for this particular purpose. The stocks were subsequently withdrawn. 26. 26. Pood and Drugs Act, 1938 Samples Taken for Analysis During the Year, 1951 Article .

Legal Proceedings Eight cases were taken before the Magistrates under Section 9 of the Act, six in relation to extraneous matters found in foodstuffs and two cases in connection with the mouldy condition of meat patties and cream buns Two cases were dismissed, one ..relating to a small piece of wire in a boiled sweet and in this instance-the Magistrates felt that every care had been taken by the defendant to secure a wholesome product. In the case of the mouldy condition of the meat patties the Magistrates were not satisfied with certain conflicting evidence as to the actual purchase. Offence Result. Cigarette-end in loaf of bread.

SECTION F. PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Diphtheria No cases of diphtheria occurred in the Borough during 1951. The facilities for immunisation against diphtheria are detailed on pages 9 &10. In addition, arrangements are made for school children to be immunised at school. The numbers of children immunised during the year were;- Primary immunisations - under 5 years 515 " " 5 to 15 years 55 Total 570 Number of children receiving secondary or reinforcing injections 224 Scarlet Fever. There was an increase of 19 in the notifications received during the year as compared with 1950* The numbers of cases and the percentages removed to hospital during the previous five years are as follows: 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 Cases notified 69 78 105 62 81 Percentage removed to hospital 61 52 46 65 48 Measles Measles was the most prevalent of the infectious diseases during 1951. The number of cases, 940, was the highest recorded since it become notifiable. Only 13 cases needed hospital care. As in previous years, measles serum was available to general practitioners on application to the Public Health Laboratory at Colindale for the treatment of cases and the protection of contacts. Whooping Cough As in the case of measles, the number of cases of whooping cough notified to the Health Department, viz: 463 as the highest since this disease became notifiable. Of this figure only 9 cases required hospital treatment. 33 Acute Poliomyelitis It is a pleasure to record that there were no confirmed cases of poliomyelitis notified in Chingford during 1951. Tuberculosis The number of fresh cases of Tuberculosis, pulmonary and nonpulmonary, notified during 1951 was 50. In addition, 11 persons previously suffering from tuberculosis, moved into this district. Dysentery. An outbreak of dysentery (Sonn6 type) occurred in the borough in the spring of 1951. Of the 39 persons involved, 11 cases were among children and staff of one of the Day Nurseries. I was anxious that, if at all possible, the Nursery should remain open and consulted with the Area Medical Officer, Forest Division Essex County Council, as the Nursery was under the control of the latter It was decided that the following administrative procedure should be adopted for thewith: specimens were taken from all staff and children. All positive cases were excluded and referred to their own doctor for treatment. All remaining staff and children were given prophylactic treatment with Succinylsulphathiazole which, I am pleased to report, aborted this local outbreak and thus permitted the Nursery to remain open. This was a great boon to many anxious mothers. All 39 cases made a rapid recovery from their illness. Food Poisoning. Only 5 persons were notified to the Health Department as suffering from food poisoning during 1951. The source of infection was not traced. All made a rapid recovery from their illness. Food Hygiene. Several, lectures, supported by films, dealing with cleanliness in the preparation and handling of food, were given to Associations in the Borough during the year. They were very much appreciated by the housewives who attended. Smallpox Contacts Several persons who had arrived in Chingford from abroad, from areas where smallpox was prevalent, were kept under surveillance -until the danger period was passed. Vaccination Number of primary vaccinations during the year - 326 Number of re-vaccinations during the year - 99 34. Scabies â No persons wore in need of treatment during the year at the Scabies Treatment Centre. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47 No statutory action was required under Section 47 of this Act during the year. Several aged and infirm persons who came to the notice of the department accepted voluntary admission to hospital or were provided with a Home Help to assist them. (b) Section 50 The Chingford Council took action under this section in one instance during the year. The whole of the cost of burial of the person concerned was recovered by the Council. Medical Examinations. During the year 20 examinations were carried out by me in respect of the Superannuation and Sick Pay Scheme of the Chingford Corporation. In addition, 48 medical examinations were carried out in respect of Essex County Council staff. 35.
