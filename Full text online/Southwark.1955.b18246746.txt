The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report for the year 1955. The population figure as calculated by the Registrar General again decreased to 93,820. An increase of 200 in the number of deaths, together with the lower population, resulted in a higher crude death rate of 13.8 per 1,000 of the population. Infant mortality increased from 21 to 28 per 1,000 births, owing chiefly to a large increase of deaths amongst the illegitimate infants. The year was marked by the unprecedented outbreaks of infectious diseases. I refer particularly to Measles, Poliomyelitis and Dysentery. The Measles epidemic was greater than ever before recorded and persisted for several months, in fact, until the early summer. Fortunately only four infants lost their lives from this disease, an indication of the greater adequacy of the newer weapons we now possess to prevent the killing complications of these types of infections. No sooner had we finished with Measles than the Borough was struck with what turned out to be the worst outbreak of Poliomyelitis that we had ever experienced. Many cases were notified but actually 64 were confirmed, of which 41 were paralytic cases. Those chiefly affected with paralysis were under 5 years of age—namely 27, of whom 21 were boys. The remainder ranged between the ages of 5 to 25. Of the non-paralytic cases—23 altogether—11 were among the under 5-year age groups and the remainder chiefly fell between 5-15 years. The epidemic commenced at the beginning of July in the north of the Borough in three of the "block" buildings in this area, and slowly became disseminated throughout the Borough, reaching its peak in mid August. From this point it slowly declined until it finally subsided in the early part of December. Extensive investigations were made into each case and families were visited and closely questioned—some on several occasions— but in spite of all our efforts we were unable to say from where the disease had come or how it was spread. Many points of interest, however, were found and many insanitary conditions were brought to light and remedied. ii Watching children at play, it was quite obvious that they preferred to play in the insanitary "bombed sites," where they could dig holes, build bricks and drag around pieces of old iron, rather than avail themselves of the sanitary, tidy playgrounds provided by the Borough Council. Moreover, in spite of our warnings to avoid crowded places, as the weather was very hot, one found large crowds of children playing in and around the ponds in the parks and gardens. A point of interest, particularly to me, was the fact that in the surrounding districts immediately over the boundaries of the Borough there were no cases of Polio, and I was forced to the conclusion, by this and other facts which I had found, that fairly close contact with a case or carrier was necessary for the spread of the disease. A point perhaps worth noting is the fact that two or three weeks before the onset of the epidemic there had been several cases of a febrile condition which had been termed "Flu" amongst the adults living in some of the buildings where the first cases of Polio were notified; the symptoms of this illness were a general malaise with headache, sore throat and feverishness, severe enough in some cases to lay up the patient. A similar type of illness was found in a few of the families both before and after a case of Polio had occurred in the family. In mid December, following in the wake of Polio, Dysentery broke out in epidemic form. This epidemic also eventually turned out to be the heaviest yet experienced here. Last year in my report I wrote at length on the cause of this disease, and preventive measures and I therefore do not intend to take up further space now. The problems for the care of the older citizens of the Borough are ever increasing. In the autumn the Council asked the Town Clerk and Medical Officer to discuss these problems to ascertain how far they were being met and to make further suggestions for enlarging and bettering the services already in existence. This report, duly presented by the Town Clerk, was given very careful and serious consideration by the Members of the Council, and already decisions have been taken which, when put into operation—I hope next year—will prove of the greatest value and help to the old people. A report on the work of the Old People's Welfare Committee will be found in the body of the report. I would like to record in this report that in September, with the full concurrence of the Council, I took over the additional duties as Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth upon the retirement from that post of Dr. A. G. Thompson, until such time as a new Medical Officer of Health was appointed. My best thanks are due to the various members of the Council and Chief Officers for the consideration they always give to me, and to the staff of the Public Health Department for their ever willing help and co-operation in the exceptionally heavy work throughout the year. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, W. STOTT. Medical Officer of Health. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (As at 31st December, 1955). Mayor—C. W. WILLIAMSON, J.P. Chairman—J. J. SHEEN.

In 1954 and again this year, the decrease widened to 1,500 less than each previous year. There was a slight decline in the birth rate after the small increase in 1954. The death rate, after decreases in the two previous years, rose sharply in 1955, the increases being chiefly in vascular lesions of the nervous system, circulatory diseases and pneumonia. The infant death rate showed a considerable rise after last year's decline, and the death rate of illegitimate infants—following its dramatic decline in 1954 to the lowest recorded for many years— increased in 1955 to nearly 80 per cent, of the abnormally high peak in 1953. The still birth rate showed a substantial decrease after rising for the two previous years.

Scarlet Fever notifications were twice as many as in 1954, but Food Poisoning remained at the same level and Whooping Cough continued to decrease. There were four deaths from Measles and one, an infant, from Salmonella Typhi-murium. IMMUNISATION Although "booster" injections were more than twice the 1954 figure, other injections were fewer due to the precautionary suspension of immunisation during the Polio outbreak. Immunisation Under 5 years of age Over 5 Diphtheria 116 37 Whooping Cough 14 — Combined 922 14 " Booster " injections 564 — 1,616 51 Total 1,667 PATHOLOGICAL SPECIMENS 951 faeces specimens were taken by the Department for pathological examination in connection with Food Poisoning and Dysentery cases. 222 were from notified home cases of which 117 proved positive, and 283 from contacts of which 72 were positive. 127 of the remaining 446 " follow-up " specimens were also positive. FOOD POISONING 18 of the 26 confirmed cases (including those for Southwark residents notified to other Boroughs from hospitals in their areas) were individual cases, as follows :— Salmonella Typhi-murium 14 Salmonella Schwarzengrund 1 Unknown 3 The remaining 8 cases were in 4 "outbreaks" (more than one case in a family) all due to Salmonella organisms. Four sudden, fortunately mild, outbreaks occurred in canteens. In only one case was the suspected food available, and the meat revealed that the causative organism, C. Welchii, had apparently developed in large numbers between the time of cooking and consumption. The meat was cooked when received, allowed to cool at atmospheric temperature, then reheated and served the next day. 6 CANCER OF LUNG AND BRONCHUS Deaths From: Neoplasm of Lung and Bronchus Respiratory T uberculosis All Causes 1952 51 45 1377 1953 62 21 1209 1954 65 22 1098 1955 57 23 1300 The highest mortality rate from neoplasm of the lung and bronchus occurred in the 45-74 age groups ; that of tuberculosis between the ages of 45 to 64.

Lloyd) The overall figures of treatments for body vermin carried out at the Centre during the year, show a slight decrease on last year's figures; but the number of male persons requiring treatment has increased by 12 per cent. The majority of these men are inmates of Lodging Houses and Hostels and are sent to the Centre for treatment, by the keepers of these establishments. It would appear that a greater insistence on a reasonable standard of personal cleanliness is now demanded from their "Lodgers", by those in charge of lodging houses and hostels. Co-operation in this commendable attitude is given by this Department and arrangements are made for our transport to collect from the lodging house or hostel for disinfestation, all bedding and effects of each person on the day they attend for treatment. A number of aged and infirm people, of both sexes, are regularly conveyed to the Centre from their homes in our transport, treated and returned home. There has been a further considerable drop during the year in the number of dwelling houses requiring disinfestation for the more usual types of domestic insects, i.e. bed bugs and fleas ; but there has been an increase in other types of insect infestation. Some considerable infestations of wood-boring beetles (" Wharf borers "— Nacerda melanura) and wood-boring weevils (Euophryum confine) have been dealt with. The continued warm weather in the summer months, resulted in some large scale invasions of houses and flats by garden ants and Clover mites (Bryobia praetiosa). In one such infestation, it was found necessary to have parts of the main wall of a building opened-up to reach the ant nests. Assistance was given by the Department to various commercial undertakings in the Borough in dealing with infestations of Moths, cockroaches and beetles. Because of the greatly increased number of notifications of suspected cases of infectious disease—in particular, Poliomyelitis— the disinfection of both premises and articles carried out, was considerably more than in recent years. In one School, the Nursery Class was closed for a period and the class rooms and contents were disinfected. Infectious Disease Cases : Enquiries and Visits.

Six intimation notices were served, all of which have been complied with. OFFENSIVE TRADES There are now three premises engaged in offensive trades in the Borough as follows :—Skin Dressers 2, Manure Manufacturer 1. During 1955, 51 inspections were made. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 Fifteen applications were received during the year for registration under the Act, all of which were satisfactory. 238 Inspections were made during the year. WATER SUPPLY The domestic water supply of the Borough is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. During the year, two complaints were received regarding the taste of water. These were due to dirty storage tanks. The Metropolitan Water Board was informed and samples analysed, which were found satisfactory. Public Health (London) Act, 1936—Section 98 During the year 40 notifications of the withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board. 14 Public Health (London) Act, 1936—Section 95 Certificates have been issued in respect of the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water at 288 new dwellings as follows:— Rowland Hill House, Nelson Square 105 flats Sayer Street, 8-10 1 flat Bazeley House, Lancaster Street 32 flats Portland Street (reconstruction) 20 „ Saltwood Grove 6 ,, Surrey Grove, 1 1 flat Great Dover Street, 60 1 house Chelsfield House, Alfreton Street 25 flats Southwark Bridge Road (reconstruction) 16 „ Borough Road, Bridge House Tavern 1 house Sutherland Square, 61 2 flats Merrow Street, Queen Elizabeth P.H. 1 house Lytham Street 45 cottages Phelp Street 9 Sondes Street 22 Westmoreland Road, Hour Glass P.H. 1 house OUTWORKERS Two hundred and twenty-four inspections of homes of outworkers were made during the year.

The results were not as spectacular as in 1954, but confirmed that the treatments in that year had been most effective. There was a continued decrease in the number of manholes infested, and out of 1,015, 642 were free from infestation. The use of quarterly treatments appears to have better results than half-yearly, and costs compared favourably as pre-baiting expenses were avoided. Complete "Takes" Fairly Heavy Slight akes" Infestations 1st Qtr. (12 oz.

In addition, extensive work has been carried out in connection with disused drainage on sites cleared after war damage and at properties demolished in connection with slum clearance. VENTILATION OF SEWERS The Council agreed to co-operate in an all-London experiment in connection with the ventilation of sewers by using existing soil pipes after removal of the stoppers from interceptor traps between sewers and private drainage systems. It was recommended that wire guards be fitted in lieu of the stoppers to prevent the risk of rats gaining access. REQUISITIONED HOUSES AND HOUSING (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1955 This Act, which came into operation on the 6th June, 1955, enables local authorities to wind up the use of requisitioning for housing purposes by 31st March, 1960, and provides new measures and Exchequer assistance to make this possible without causing hardship to the families living in the houses, including provisions for payments to owners who are willing to accept licensees as statutory tenants and grants to local authorities leasing or purchasing requisitioned houses or houses in substitution therefor. The Minister of Housing and Local Government has directed local authorities to invite the owners of requisitioned houses to accept the licensees as their statutory tenants, and special compensation (in 17 addition to payments under the Compensation (Defence) Act, 1939 in respect of damage to property whilst requisitioned) will be paid to owners who agree to do so. A tenancy created by an owner accepting the release of a requisitioned dwelling with the present occupants will be protected by the Rents Acts and a new standard rent will be calculated. The tenant will not, however, be required to pay more than he paid under the licence except so far as the local authority may from time to time determine, and until the 1st April, 1965, or until the former licensee or his statutory successor leaves, any difference between the reduced rent and the full rent will be payable by the local authority to the landlord. After the 1st April, 1965, the tenant will pay the full standard rent. HOUSING REPAIRS & RENTS ACT, 1954 125 certificates of disrepair and 109 revocation certificates were issued during the year under the above Act. WATERCLOSETS The Public Health Committee agreed to a proposal made by the London County Council to repeal the bye-law relating to waterclosets, it being considered that Section 11 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, now gives local authorities adequate powers in this respect. RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 During the year four samples were taken and submitted to the prescribed Analyst Mr. G. Ginger, F.C.S., Chiltern Research Laboratories, Ltd., Marlow. All these samples complied with the requirements of the Regulations. Ten premises are registered for the use of filling materials, and one licensed for manufacture or storage of Rag Flock. WELL WATER The three private wells in the Borough are still in use for industrial purposes. The supply in each case is satisfactory. LITTER The Council supported a suggestion from the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee that the scope of the L.C.C. Bye-law relating to litter deposited on the highway should be extended. Whilst the bye-law provides penalties for persons depositing refuse from a house, shop or street stall, or other refuse likely to cause injury, it does not cover litter otherwise deposited, or the position where it is likely to become a danger or a nuisance. 18 LIGHTING OF STAIRCASES As a result of representations to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee the London County Council inserted a clause in their General Powers (No. 2) Bill regarding the hghting of staircases in houses in multiple occupation. CEILING HEIGHTS The Committee had previously agreed to support a proposal that representations should be made to the Minister of Housing and Local Government against his requirement, in approving housing schemes, that the top floors of maisonettes, houses and flats should have a ceiling height of not more than 7 ft. 6 in. In view of the division of opinion from constituent councils, however, the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee decided not to make the representations proposed. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS The Council fixed 1st September, 1955 as the date on which the provisions of Section 18 of the L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, 1954, relating to hairdressers and barbers' establishments should come into effect in this Borough. Fifty-one such premises were registered at the end of the year. CLEAN AIR BILL This Bill, which had its second reading in the Commons in November, has four main purposes:— (i) To prohibit the emission of dark smoke from chimneys, railway engines, etc., subject to certain qualifications. (ii) To prohibit the installation of new industrial furnaces unless they are capable, so far as practicable, of being operated without emitting smoke. (iii) To require that the emission of grit and dust from existing industrial furnaces shall be minimised, and that new industrial furnaces burning pulverised fuel or large quantities of other solid fuel shall be provided with grit-arresting equipment. (iv) To empower local authorities by order, subject to confirmation by the Minister concerned, to declare "smoke-control areas," in which the emission of smoke from chimneys will constitute an offence. The Bill provides for the payment of grants by the Exchequer and by Local Authorities towards the cost of converting appliances where necessary in private dwellings in smoke-control areas; for amending and extending the operation of the Alkali, etc., Works Regulation Act, 1906; for the application of the Act to Crown premises and naval vessels. Certain amendments to the Bill were, however, being drafted by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee. 19 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION (Smoke Abatement Officer—Mr. G. Stubbs.) The figures of deposited matter in the Bankside area, which is an industrialised district, showed a decided improvement over the figures of the previous year. Probably this result was largely due to the restricted use of the old Bankside Generating Station. It is noteworthy that the figures of deposits recorded at Walworth Road, which is mainly a residential area, have shown little variation during the past few years. As in previous years, several complaints were received of smoke emission from works' incinerators burning waste straw, wood chips and rubbish. Visits by the Inspector and instructions on the proper methods of operating the plants produced good results. Most of the complaints of smoke from factory chimneys were found on investigation to be due to excessive demands on the boilers or to mechanical faults. It is pleasing to record that in all cases the managements concerned readily co-operated and took action to abate the nuisances. Two firms have converted their furnaces from coal-burning to oil-burning and the results have proved satisfactory. Several other firms have stated their intention to consider a change to oil-burning. The first visit by members of the newly formed South-East Division of the National Smoke Abatement Society was to the new Bankside Power Station where the flue-gas washing plant was seen in operation. The party was welcomed to Southwark by the Mayor. The Borough Council has in use two Standard Deposit Gauges, three Lead-Peroxide Instruments and one Smoke and Volumetric Sulphur-Dioxide Apparatus. The figures of the deposited matter as recorded on the sites at Bankside and Walworth Road are as follows:— 1955 Bankside rth Road January 65.9 29.7 tons per square mile February 36.5 23.2 do. March 30.1 21.3 do. April 20.4 14.6 do. May 29.2 21.5 do. June 25.1 22.8 do. July 14.0 9.9 do. August 17.0 13.7 do. September 27.2 21.9 do. October 24.6 22.6 do. November 15.8 14.5 do. December 40.2 19.9 do. During the year sixteen complaints were received regarding smoke emissions: 163 observations and inspections were made by the Inspector, and 9 Intimation Notices issued. 20 FACTORIES ACTS Five hundred and thirty-four inspections of Factories were made during the year, and 28 notices were served. There are now 1,024 factories of all types on the register, comprising 251 factories without mechanical power, 746 with mechanical power, and in addition 27 building sites, for which a further 91 inspections were made, but no notices served.

REHOUSING There was little change in the total number of applicants seeking the assistance of the Public Health Department for rehousing. New cases of overcrowding again decreased slightly but considerably fewer were rehoused, and the total of these cases remaining on the register at the end of 1955 was more than at the end of the previous year. There were slightly fewer cases needing medical recommendation.

There are no major modifications of the Plan as it affects this Borough, but the Minister re-zoned for residential purposes two areas in Southwark which had been zoned for commercial and light industrial purposes. The Minister approved a density of population of 136 persons to the acre for this borough. SLUM CLEARANCE PROGRAMME, 1956-60 In consultation with the London County Council, joint proposals for dealing with slum clearance in this Borough during the next five years have been submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government in accordance with Section 1 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. The proposals provide for this Council to deal with 257 unfit houses during the period 1956-60 and the County Council will deal with areas comprising 341 houses, making a total of 598 houses. It has been agreed that the balance of the list of 903 unfit houses submitted to the County Council are not in such a condition that they should be dealt with immediately, but further consideration will be given to their clearance before the end of the five-year programme. 26 FOOD THE INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD During the year, 377,200 tons of imported food were inspected under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937 and 1948, and the Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations, 1925 to 1953. The consignments imported were as follows:— Description Tonnage Meat 47,981 Canned Meat 34,797 Offal 4,190 Poultry 5,254 Casein 1,363 Bacon 2,126 Butter 31,729 Margarine 7,640 Lard 9,907 Canned Milk and Milk Powder 2,226 Eggs and Egg Albumen 4,198 Cheese 27,169 Fruit 66,518 Canned Fruit 44,317 Vegetables 23,946 Cereals 12,022 Nuts 6,603 Canned Fish 9,673 Canned Soup 416 Des.

Bottled Prawns. A consignment comprising 100 cases (48X2½ ozs.) bottled Prawns was detained at St. Mary Overy's Wharf for further examination. 24 cases and 16 jars were released on condition that they be reexported to Norway. The remainder of the consignment was found fit for human consumption and accordingly released. Corned Beef. A consignment of Australian Corned Beef with Cereal was detained at New Hibernia Wharf for a 100 per cent. examination. 209 cases (9x5 lbs.) and 5 tins were found unfit and released for processing into animal feeding stuff. The remaining 288 cases (9x5 lbs.) were sound and accordingly released for human consumption. Cheddar Cheese. A consignment comprising 20 crates of imported New Zealand Cheddar Cheese was detained at New Hibernia Wharf. These crates were splashed by ship's soil pipe during unloading. After cleaning and trimming, this consignment was released for processing. Gammon and Shoulder Hams. A consignment comprising 61 cases (6X8 lbs.) and 12 tins of Gammon Hams and 151 cases (6X8 lbs.) and 18 tins of Shoulder Hams was permitted to be returned to the overseas suppliers, in Lisbon. This arrangement was agreed to as the result of an unsatisfactory report received from the Bacteriologist. Indonesian Groundnut Kernels. Three consignments comprising 559 bags, (approximately 50 tons) of Indonesian Groundnut Kernals were detained because of infestation. They were ultimately released for oil extraction. 28 UNSOUND FOOD During the year 166 tons 5 cwts. 3 lbs. of food examined at wharves, warehouses and shops were found unfit for human consumption and disposed of as follows:— Food condemned at wharves and warehouses :— Destroyed: Tons Cwts.

Most of the dealers sold only pre-packed ice-cream, obtained from the large manufacturers. During the year 37 samples of ice-cream were taken with the following results:— 20 samples, Grade I. 6 samples, Grade II. 5 samples, Grade III. 6 samples, Grade IV. In addition: 28 samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition of ice-cream. Four of these samples did not contain the requisite amount of fat and the vendors were cautioned. Samples subsequently taken at the premises were satisfactory. Periodical inspections were made to all premises. A "Code of Standards" was sent to each new dealer and inspections were carried out before the registration of any new premises to ensure that they were satisfactory and all requirements fully understood. Copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. In the case of Grade III 30 and IV samples, special investigations were made at the premises in an effort to detect some fault which may have caused the unsatisfactory gradings. DESIGNATED MILK During the year the following Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949. 120 Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 162 Dealers' Licences for Sterilised Milk. 96 Dealers' Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Supplementary Licences 17 Supplementary Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 17 Supplementary Licences for Sterilised Milk. 15 Supplementary Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Forty-seven samples of Designated Milks were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. All these satisfied the prescribed tests. Twenty-nine samples of Pasteurised Milk supplied to local schools were also examined by the Public Analyst, and the London County Council informed of the results. MILK SELLERS At the close of the year there were 147 registered milk distributors in the Borough, whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the Borough from registered premises elsewhere was 17. 305 inspections of Milkshops and Dairies were made during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS Nine samples of condensed milk were purchased for analysis under the above regulations. They were all certified by the Public Analyst to comply with the said regulations. BAKEHOUSES At the end of the year there were 22 Bakehouses in use in Southwark, of which 4 were Basement Bakehouses. Ninety-eight inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors. Basement Bakehouses at 325, Walworth Road, 167, Manor Place, 168 Borough High Street were closed by the occupiers. 31 COFFEE In October an informal sample described as "Coffee" was found on analysis to consist of a dry coffee extract. The manufacturers were averse to calling their product a coffee extract, and claimed it was soluble coffee and that accordingly there was no contravention of the Labelling of Food Order. Discussions were held with the Food Manufacturers' Federation, and mutual agreement was reached on the re-wording of the label. FOOD STANDARDS (TABLE JELLIES) AMENDMENT ORDER, 1955 This order provides for the use of low setting gelatine and allows a content of not less than 2½ ounces sugar per pint of prepared table jelly sweet, as an alternative to the former standard of 84 per cent. sugar content in jelly crystals. TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS (MINISTRY OF FOOD) ORDER, 1955 This Order dissolved the Ministry of Food and transferred most of its functions to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. MYXOMATOSIS In March, the Ministry of Food issued a circular that all carcases of rabbits and hares infected with myxomatosis should be regarded as unfit for human consumption. This followed a prosecution of a trader who claimed that the virus of this disease is not communicable to man. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 This Act will repeal the Food and Drugs Act, 1954, and consolidates it together with the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950 and certain sections of the Slaughterhouses Act, 1954 and of the Slaughter of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1954. The new Act will come into effect on 1st January, 1956. Some of the more important changes in the law are as follows : Provides that the probable cumulative effects of consuming food injurious to health should be taken into consideration; gives power for a Court to disqualify a caterer convicted of a serious offence against the Regulations; contains new provisions as to description of cream substitutes; certain important changes in the procedure for sampling and analysis; gives powers to enter ships, aircraft, vehicles, etc.; the time limit within which a prosecution must be 32 made where a sample has been procured is increased for foods other than milk; changes in the conditions for the acceptance of a warranty as a defence. MINERAL OIL IN FOOD (AMENDMENT REGULATIONS) 1955 Chewing compounds such as chewing gum, are now included in the definition of food under the 1955 Food and Drugs Act, and the above Regulations were made to provide for the presence of 12.5 per cent. micro-crystalline wax in such compounds, used to increase their plasticity. LABELLING OF FOOD (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 1955 These Regulations re-enact, with certain modifications, the provisions of sections 32 and 33 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, which the new Food and Drugs Act repealed, and cover the labelling, marking and advertising of margarine and margarine cheese. FOOD STANDARDS (BUTTER AND MARGARINE) REGULATIONS, 1955 These Regulations, coming into operation on 1st January, 1956, prescribe standards for butter and margarine similar to those previously contained under section 32 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS, 1955 These Regulations give extensive provisions for the prevention of contamination of food, not only during its sale but also in its preparation, storage, transport and all stages of handling. They come into effect on 1st January, 1956 (excepting certain provisions involving alterations to premises, which are deferred until 1st July, 1956) and replace section 13 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, which is repealed by the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, and Regulations 19, 20 and 21 of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924. FOOD HYGIENE During the year the Chief Sanitary Inspector gave several talks to food traders on food hygiene and methods for preventing food contamination. These talks evoked keen interest and co-operation from the traders. SLAUGHTERHOUSES There are now no licensed slaughterhouses in the Borough. 33 CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 433 catering establishments in the Borough. These include riverside snack bars, cafes, coffee stalls, mobile snack bars, public house restaurants, and industrial canteens. All have received systematic inspection and close supervision during the year, and a satisfactory standard has been maintained. REGISTRATION OF FOOD PREMISES (Food and Drugs Act, 1938) There are now 91 premises (an increase of 3) registered for the purpose of the Preparation or Manufacture of Sausages or Potted, Pressed, Pickled or Preserved Food intended for Sale. Two premises (an increase of 1) are registered for the purpose of Wholesale Dealing in Margarine and one for Butter Blending and Packeting.

Morris, The Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee, reports a further expansion in every Branch of the Committee's work during the year. Nearly 50,000 meals were provided during the year. 19,591 meals were served in the Gate House Restaurant, and 4,061 in the Nelson Square Luncheon Club. A new Luncheon Club was opened in the Church of the Lady Margaret Hall, and served 653 meals. The Old People's Welfare Committee added a third van to the two already in service. The three vans supplied 13,298 meals and the two W.V.S. vans supplied 12,150 meals. The total of 25,448 Meals-on-Wheels was an increase of over 5,000 on the previous year. 37 The organised holiday to Southsea included 150 old people. This was an increase of 50 on the previous year, as on that occasion 50 almspeople from Norwood joined in the holiday. There were again day outings to seaside, country and theatre for the able-bodied; and the Rotary Club of Southwark once more arranged private car outings and parties for the frail, infirm and housebound. Twice weekly Club Meetings at the Gate House provided music, games, lectures, debates and entertainments, some of which were given also in the evenings. The number of individual cases referred to the Old People's Welfare Committee by hospitals, doctors and others rose to 1,351, and covered th usual great variety of problems. The home visiting of these peoD.e was carried out by the Organising Secretary and a small band of voluntary visitors. There were two new ventures. A Travelling Library was started by the Old People's Welfare Committee, with the help of Rotary Club cars, and was later taken over by the Public Library. The International Voluntary Service for Peace decided to devote their weekends to cleaning and decorating old people's flats, and an average of three flats were dealt with weekly throughout the year. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT Compulsory Removals. Three persons were removed to an Old People's Home under Section 47, and the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, which provide for the compulsory removal of persons in need of care and attention. Burial of the Dead. During the year the Council arranged for eighteen burials under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, at a total cost of £171 5s. 6d.
