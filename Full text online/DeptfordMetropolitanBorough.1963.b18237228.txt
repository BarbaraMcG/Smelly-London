To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am privileged to present this Report on the health and environmental circumstances of Deptford for 1963. The estimated population for mid year 1963 was 68,450, a reduction of 530 on last year which is in line with the local population trend during the last decade. There was however, a gain of births over deaths of 816. The number of deaths declined and the death rate was reduced from 11.69 to 11.18. The infant mortality rate however increased sharply from the low figure of 17.63 to 24.65 and the peri-natal mortality rate, which is perhaps the most reliable index of the general well-being of local newlyborn infants, was again higher than last year. These rates fluctuate from year to year and accurate conclusions can only be made over a period when a general trend can be perceived. Analysing infant deaths it is surprising how many die in hospital and from infections particularly of the chest. The greater proportion of deaths however, were associated with congenital malformations and prematurity, the causes of which are as yet obscure and not readily amenable to preventive action. Turning to infectious diseases, one notes the substantial number of measles cases and sonne dysentery showed a considerable increase, 429 cases being notified, necessitating careful investigation and laborious testing, not only of the patients but also of the families and close contacts involved. No other infectious disease requires comment except to express thanks to Dr. Rigby for his contribution which is always lively, interesting and at times controversial. I could not, for instance, accept unreservedly his oblique statements about the "sooty terraces of Deptford." Being an industrial Borough, Deptford receives its due measure of atmospheric pollutants, but reference to the grit and smoke analyses over the last 6-7 years indicates a very substantial improvement in the atmosphere. This reference does less than justice to the exertions of the staff in connection with the Clean Air Act and, in this respect, Deptford can bear favourable comparison with any other Borough of like social and industrial pattern. This year saw a great expansion of services for the elderly. A separate Welfare Committee was constituted and an account of the early work of the Committee is included in the main report. The laundry and home bathing service showed a substantial increase as did the number of visits paid to the homes of the frail elderly. Meals on Wheels and luncheon clubs are now a direct Council service; there are three vehicles in service and two lunch clubs. Plans are already advanced for four more luncheon clubs and two more vehicles for meals on wheels and a target of about 150,000 meals per annum to old people will be reached next year. Holidays for nearly 300 elderly, arranged by the Deptford Old People's Welfare Association, were honoured by the Council and transport and other 2 arrangements were provided. Next year it is hoped that 500 will be sent on holiday directly by the Council and provision is being made for a substantial number of home bound and handicapped to be included in the holiday programme. This year saw the retirement of Mr. G. F. Wilton, the Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector. His high professional competence and his ever genial presence already has been missed. He had a profound knowledge of housing matters and notwithstanding his approach to retirement age, he set an example to his colleagues in energy and enthusiasm. The student public health inspectors will remember and be grateful for his kindly interest in their progress and well-being. It gives me much pleasure to conclude this preface by thanking the Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of the Public Health and Welfare Committees and the members for the continuous encouragement the Department has had in expanding very rapidly services which are giving great help to vulnerable members of the community. None of these endeavours would have been possible however, without the support and companionship of the Staff to whom I express my gratitude. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STAFF Medical Officer of Health J. Kerr Brown, b.sc., m.b., ch.b., d.p.h. Public Analyst (part-time) H.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar-General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0.93 and for deaths 1.08 and the birth rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated decrease in the population is 530, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 816. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table. I The deaths are classified under 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948. Area of Borough 1,564 acres.

This increase is accounted for mainly by the number of Measles cases notified viz: 778 as against 121 in 1962. The other significant increase was in Sonne Dysentery, 429 cases being notified as against 72 in the previous year. There was also an increase in the number of cases of Whooping Cough, 72 as against 13 in the previous year. Sonne Dysentery The outbreak of Sonne Dysentery was concerned mainly with 4 schools in the Borough and our officers were responsible for the collection of faeces specimens which were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory (Public Health Laboratory Service) for examination. By arrangement with the School Health Authority, no child is re-admitted to school until certified free of infection by me. The following table shows the extent to which the Department was involved:— Patients and Contacts examined 1,725 Specimens taken 2,358 Patients positive 376 Specimens positive 661 Number of visits by Inspector 2,535 Eleven of the patients were found to have food poisoning or B. Coli serotypes. Thirty food handlers were kept off work and four hundred and eighty three school children were excluded from school until certified free from infection. 0-1 years 1-2 years 2-5 years 5-15 years 15-25 years 25-45 years 15-65 rears Over 65 years Total Deaths m f m F m f m f m f m F m f m f Scarlet Fever 2 1 1 3 7 8 4 1 27 Erysipelas 1 2 3 Dysentery 7 5 8 8 37 30 53 58 21 48 62 54 16 22 429 Acute Pneumonia 1 1 3 2 1 6 5 2 6 6 33 Measles 26 22 55 77 152 176 121 140 1 2 4 2 778 Whooping Cough 6 7 7 7 17 11 11 6 72 Puerperal Pyrexia 2 3 5 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 2 2 Scabies 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 1 10 Zymotic Enteritis 5 6 11 Food Poisoning 1 1 1 3 TOTALS 45 35 76 99 211 224 193 212 27 56 67 65 23 27 6 7 1373 9 Tuberculosis There was a significant decrease in the number of deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis viz: 7 as compared with 45 in the previous year. The number of notifications showed a slight increase in the number of cases notified for the first time, viz: 84 as against 81. It is interesting to note that fifty years ago the number of notifications in respect of this disease was 442 and the number of deaths 148. Seventeen of the primary notifications related to men living in Carrington House, a common lodging house in the Borough, approximately one quarter of the total male notifcations.

P. V. Rigby, for the following report concerning the Chest Clinic at Harton Street. Dr. Rigby's report is, as usual, full of interest. Cases on Chest Clinic Register at 31.12.63:— Definite 1,122 Observation 33 Number of new contacts examined 344 Total attendance at the Chest Clinic 6,257 TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE Interviews by Secretary 614 Cases assisted by Care Committee 22 Sums raised by Christmas Seal Sale, 1962 £40 8s. 7d. "The total number of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis remains roughly constant in the Deptford area. Cases are removed from the list when they are considered to be recovered from the disease. The standards of cure are necessarily high. It is better to go on seeing patients, even at long intervals, than to lose touch with them and risk a relapse. It must not be imagined, however, that follow up of cases is easy. This mainly involves visits of trained nursing staff to homes, and often the patient is out. I have on my Tuberculosis Register at any one time a few patients who avoid follow up of their condition despite strenuous efforts by myself 10 and my staff. A few patients still discharge themselves prematurely from tuberculosis hospitals and even manage to get back to work, and if they abandon the treatment by anti-tuberculous drugs, may loose their germs on an unsuspecting world. As the tubercle bacillus lives for such a long time in body tissues, even longer than these germs persist in filth and dirt outside the body, the treatment has to be prolonged and may last one or even two or more years after discharge from hospital A great potential danger is the patient with partly treated tuberculosis, who, though he attends the chest clinic regularly and acccepts prescriptions, fails to take the drugs prescribed. Well protected with its wax envelope, the tubercle bacillus rapidly becomes able to resist even strong anti-tuberculous medicines if these are not taken in the full amounts prescribed. Twenty patients whose names were on the Tuberculosis Register died in 1963, all except one from diseases quite other than tuberculosis. The pulmonary tuberculosis element had been treated. At one time the diagnosis of tuberculosis meant that one would die of it sooner or later. In general, work at the Deptford Chest Clinic has actually increased, and there were over 700 more attendances. Coincident with this my medical assistant had his sessions reduced from four to three weekly. A large number of chest x-rays were done on patients sent to me by local general medical practitioners, an increase of 350 on 1962. The total number of these newly referred cases, including 344 new contacts of tuberculosis, was 1,583. Of these new arrivals at the clinic, 127 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were diagnosed during 1963. Well over half of these cases (71) were of moderate severity. I have recently seen for myself that newly diagnosed cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in Southern and Central Africa are very much more advanced in severity. In Deptford the number of advanced cases of pulmonary tuberculosis has decreased over the last few years. Of the 127 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, 25 were shown to be coughing up tubercle bacilli at the time of diagnosis. Counting old and new patients together, no less than 46 Deptford persons were known to be coughing up tubercle germs during 1963, and some of the bacilli were found to be resistant to the tuberculosis drugs. I have noted down the names of 50 patients from Carrington House who attended this clinic for the first time during 1963. Of these, no less than 31 were found to have pulmonary tuberculosis past or present, and usually the disease was active. The great majority had already had some severe chest disease as well, frequently chronic bronchitis. Most of the names of these men are already unfamiliar to me, as most of them have already moved to other areas, frequently without a trace, and some in the middle of a course of anti-tuberculous treatment. It is this mobile population of tuberculous cases in lodging houses that keeps tuberculosis a potential menace in London and possibly elsewhere. Carrington House evidently needs an intensive case finding drive at frequent intervals and also, in my view, needs an organisation fairly close at hand to deal quickly with any abnormalities found in the inmates. I understand that almost 1,000 men sleep there every night, rarely the same thousand. During the latter part of 1963 an investigation was started on the smoking habits of school children and other young people in Deptford 11 attending this clinic for various reasons. So far, a group of 212 people between the ages of 13 and 25 years has been studied. Of these, approximately half the males under 21 years were found to smoke, usually in the region of 5 to 10 cigarettes daily. 80% of the girls under the age of 21 years did not smoke. Between 21 and 25 years of age about 50% of both sexes smoked. One young man smoked 80 cigarettes daily when under conditions of stress. There were signs that stress played a part in the increase of smoking as age increased and responsibilities began to accumulate. Some formidable heavy smokers were found in middle life. This study is to continue. Preventive measures against tuberculosis continued apace. In addition to 340 new contact examinations, many persons in previous contact with tuberculosis were being checked as this is the group of persons at greatest risk. No less than 186 persons were inoculated with B.C.G. vaccine against tuberculosis during the year. In addition to the finding of pulmonary tuberculosis, the clinic has seen 40 new cases of lung cancer out of several hundred sent for intensive investigations. Some of these 40 cases have been successfully subjected to chest operations." As might be expected from dwellers in the sooty terraces of Deptford, there were many cases of chronic bronchitis and a clinic for bronchitic sufferers is being held. It may seem a pity if these useful local facilities of diagnosis and treatment are moved out of Deptford where there is clearly so much work still to be done." 12 Mass Miniature Radiography Analysis of Results of Survey carried out at Deptford during the Year 1963 (including general public, factories and colleges) General Analysis Men Women Total Part I (a) Total X-rayed 3,327 1,688 5,015 (b) Total previously mass X-rayed within five years 2,092 878 2,970 (c) Total reviewed (considered possibly abnormal at first reading) 259 62 321 (d) Considered abnormal after review 183 36 219 (e) Failed to attend for large film 2 — 2 Part II (Analysis of Abnormal Films) (1) Cases considered tuberculous and referred for further investigation : (a) No further action required — — — (b) Occasional supervision 10 1 11 (c) Requiring close supervision or treatment 24 1 25 (d) Still under investigation — — — (e) Refused further investigation 1 1 2 (2) Previously known tuberculous cases 14 3 17 (3) Non-tuberculosis cases: (a) Investigated 38 8 46 (b) Still under investigation — — — (4) Cardio vascular lesions 11 7 18 (5) Abnormalities requiring no action 85 15 100 Cases requiring close supervision or treatment Incidence per 1,000 examined = 5.0 (males 7.2 per 1,000) Incidence per 1,000 examined (Carrington House) = 83.0 Section "C" SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES ETC., AND FACTORIES ACT 14 SANITARY INSPECTION General During the year two Public Health Inspectors left the Borough, one on retirement and one resignation. We were able to recruit three young Inspectors following the July examination (one of whom was a student who had been trained in Deptford). With this increase in staff the total number of primary inspections carried out rose from 4,366 in 1962 to 5,279. There was an increase in the number of complaints received, the respective figures being 1107 to 1406. A preliminary survey was carried out in connection with the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963, which comes into operation in 1964 and much useful information obtained. During the year a slum clearance survey was carried out and an effort made to deal with the many houses in multiple occupation in the Borough. A full report of these activities is given in the Housing Section of this report. Defects found were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the London County Council (General Powers) Acts and the London County Council Bye-laws. Rodent Control Two rodent operators were employed throughout the year under the general direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector, and the following tables summarise the work carried out:— 15 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1963 Type of Property Non-Agricultural (1) Local Authority (2) Dwelling Houses (including Council Houses) (3) All other (including business premises) (4) Total of Cols.

Any other points of interest:— Primary visits by Public Health Inspectors 124 Re-visits by Public Health Inspectors 212 A high proportion of business premises in the Borough have their own contracts with private service companies for the control and destruction of rats and mice. This largely accounts for the smallness of the figure relating to business premises. 18 Disinfection and Cleansing The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing:— Disinfestations. Premises 211 Rooms 201 Articles 13,017 Disinfections. Premises 146 Rooms 84 Articles 10,033 Library Books 10 There was a small amount of disinfection carried out for a local firm who required bags to be steam disinfected before export and an amount of £20 0s. 0d. was received in respect of this service. Bathing Station Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 107 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies and impetigo 27 (108 Baths) Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 560 Baths (Old People) Home 1,014 Bathing Station 399 Laundry The laundry service is for aged infirm people in the Borough, who are incontinent and who have difficulty in obtaining someone to wash and cleanse their bedclothes and personal underclothing, etc. The equipment consists of a Washing Machine, Hydro-extractor and Ironing Machine, and the work is carried out by the Bathing Station and Disinfecting staff. Number of patients 95 Number of collections and deliveries 6,143 Number of articles cleansed 54,055 These figures show an increase in the number of collections and deliveries of 2,077 and in the number of articles cleansed 10,662. The laundry and bathing service is working to the utmost capacity and mention must be made of the excellent work which is being done by Mr. Wellbelove, the Station Superintendent and his staff. Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. 19 The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and sufficient water supply were issued in respect of 186 new premises. All dwelling houses in the Borough have water supply direct to the house and none are supplied from standpipes. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 On the 1st October, 1963, further Smoke Control Areas in the Borough came into operation. These areas contain 126 acres and include 1,951 dwellings, 7 industrial premises, 63 commercial undertakings and 7 others. During the early part of the year the Clean Air staff were also engaged in the inspection of houses in the proposed Nos. 5 and 5A Smoke Control Areas which were confirmed by the Minister early in 1964. Area No. 5 covers 119 acres and includes 934 houses, (1680 dwellings), 118 Shops, 3 Churches, 17 factories, 6 public houses, 3 schools, 3 lockup garages 1 dairy, 3 warehouses, 1 office, 4 builders yards, 1 Public Library, 2 railway stations and 6 miscellaneous premises. Area No. 5A covers 54 acres (mainly the L.C.C. Silwood Estate area in this Borough) and includes 595 houses or flats (620 dwellings), 1 church, 5 shops, 3 warehouses, 13 factories, 3 public houses and 1 Public Baths. The Clean Air Officer's inspections and visits during 1963 are summarised as follows:— Smoke Control Order inspections 1,820 Smoke Observations 338 Factory Visits 598 Miscellaneous 276 A station for measuring atmospheric pollution is set up in the Public Health Department building and results and details are sent to the Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. 20 Attached is a summary of readings during the year:— Daily Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide (microgrammes per cubic metre) MONTH SMOKE SULPHUR DIOXIDE Average Maximum Average Maximum January 387 1,061 568 1,408 February 349 476 429 713 March 103 261 129 357 April 129 306 226 661 May 76 211 104 244 June — 178 — 612 July 48 94 83 231 August 59 132 83 293 September 97 208 144 295 October 96 239 127 258 November 151 540 136 641 December 310 513 378 657 SEWAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL Sewage disposal throughout the Borough is by means of Borough Council and London County Council Sewers and is perfectly adequate. 21 Factories Act, 1937 1.

Section "E" HOUSING 28 HOUSING At the end of 1963 the Council had 1,738 permanent houses, maisonettes and flats, and 122 temporary houses of various types. Included in the total of 1,860 are 221 properties which have been acquired by the Council and which house 291 family units. During the year, 48 flats and maisonettes were completed for the Council. Also, 1,856 improvements were carried out in 640 houses, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 126. Apart from the flats completed by the Council, 129 flats were completed by the London County Council, and 7 houses by private builders. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1963:— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 1,473 Number of Statutory Notices served 349 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 649 HOUSING ACT, 1957 Section 17—Closing Orders Four houses were closed during the year. Five closing orders were determined. Sections 42-67—Clearance and Re-development (i) A slum clearance programme was put in hand. 203 premises were surveyed, involving 263 families. (ii) Consideration was given to a slum clearance proposal in another area and 395 properties were surveyed, involving 582 families (iii) A detailed survey was made of three blocks of dwellings in consideration of possible improvement. 150 dwellings were surveyed. (ix) An external inspection of properties on an Estate in the Borough in connection with the proposed purchase by the Council. Section 90—Overcrowding and Rooms unfit for sleeping Seven cases of overcrowding and 12 rooms reported as unfit were referred to the Public Health Committee. 29 HOUSING ACT, 1961 Section 12—Management Code for Houses in Multiple Occupation After all other measures had failed, six premises were reported to the Public Health Committee for Management Orders. Section 14—Power to require work to be done to make good neglect of proper standards of Management Order under Section 12 has been served One house was reported to the Public Health Committee. The neglect was subsequently made good by the owner. Section 15—Power to require the execution of works of other descriptions, having regard to the number of persons or households, or both, accommodated for the time being on the premises In practice it was often deemed necessary to consider Section 15 action with Section 16 (below). 28 premises were reported to the Public Health Committee for action and the position at the end of the year was as follows:— Works Completed 2 Works in hand 4 Taken out of multiple occupation 3 To be taken out of multiple occupation 1 Persons or households reduced 3 Re-developed into self-contained units 1 Vacated 1 In default (and being followed up) 5 Service of notices not completed 8 Section 16—Provision of Means of Escape from Fire Twenty-four premises were reported to the Public Health Committee and subsequently referred to the London County Council for consideration. Section 19—Power for the Local Authority to give directions to prevent or reduce overcrowding in houses in multiple occupation 172 premises, involving 373 separate lettings were reported to the Public Health Committee and directions were made to prevent overcrowding in 289 lettings and reduce overcrowding in 84. Constant re-visiting following these directions revealed six contraventions. In 5 of these cases, the overcrowding was remedied and in the other case the house was acquired by the Council. A full report on the housing activities of the Department was contained in a special report to the Council in January, 1964 and the above details comprise a brief summary of that report. 30 RENT ACT, 1957.

Section "G" SERVICES FOR OLD PEOPLE (HEALTH AND WELFARE) 34 OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE In April, 1963, the Council assumed responsibility for many of the functions which were organised formerly by the Deptford Old People's Welfare Association and decided to augment the Meals on Wheels and Luncheon Club Services which were being organised by the Women's Voluntary Services. By agreement with the Old People's Welfare Association, the Council took over their arrangements for old people's holidays, i.e. hotel bookings, fees, transport etc. and continued to fill places which had been booked in advance by the Association for May and September holidays as well as arrangements for special holidays for handicapped. During the summer 239 people went away on "group" holidays and holidays were arranged for 54 handicapped old people. In April, 1963, there existed one luncheon club for old people, organised by the W.V.S. at a Hall in Deptford Church Street. One further club was opened during the year and four further clubs are proposed for 1964. The Meals on Wheels service expanded to such an extent that the three vehicles which were in use during the year were insufficient for the demand and two further vehicles are proposed for 1964. To organise the development of these meals services, a part time paid organiser was engaged and her enthusiasm and energy has contributed largely to the success of the scheme. During the summer, two parties, of about 20 each were taken by Council transport for a drive into Kent, which included a stop for tea. In addition to the two outings organised by the Council, other outings were arranged by the Deptford Old People's Welfare Association and the Women's Voluntary Services. For home visiting, the Council has had for some years, two lady public health officers who have dealt mainly with the elderly infirm and sick as a public health measure. This service was augmented slightly by a lady member of the Old People's Welfare section of the Public Health Department who visited old people in connection with holidays etc. It has been felt necessary that a whole time visitor should be appointed for social purposes and this appointment will commence in April, 1964. A Laundry Service is provided for the elderly incontinent and although this is strictly a public health measure I feel that it should be mentioned as over 54,000 articles were laundered during the year, an increase of 12,000 when compared with 1963. A bathing service, also a public health matter, is provided both at the Bathing Station and in the old peoples own homes and this again is an expanding service. Finally, by arrangement with the British Red Cross Society, a chiropody service is to be set up for homebound old people in urgent need of treatment. A detailed summary of the services for old people is shown in Table VIII in the Appendix to this Report. Section "H" MISCELLANEOUS 36 MISCELLANEOUS Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single men throughout the district. Laboratory Service Food samples are usually sent to the Medical Research Laboratory at County Hall, but clinical items, e.g., faeces specimens, continue to be sent to the Park Hospital Laboratories. The facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, are very occasionally used by general practitioners for the examination of swabs and other specimens. Mortuary The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, greatly increased. The total number of bodies received during 1963 was 650, of which 287 were received from Greenwich, and 274 from Woolwich. A fee of £2 2s. Od. per body is paid by the Greenwich and Woolwich Borough Councils in respect of these admissions. One resident Mortuary Keeper is engaged full time and he is assisted from time to time by a member of the staff of the Borough Engineer. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions, etc. Section 47 of this Act provides for procuring the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an Order of the Court. Several cases were removed to hospital during the year, after persuasion and it was not necessary to invoke Section 47 during the year. (b) Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. 37 Ten persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1963. Pharmacy and Poisons Act Applications were received from 33 persons for the retention of their names for a further period of twelve months in the Council's list of persons entitled to sell poisons included in part 2 of the Poisons List. Shops Act, 1950 In the course of their routine inspection the Public Health Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of " break-point" chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At iiderton Road Baths, 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act Five applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council after visits by the Public Health Inspectors. Medical Examinations During the year 80 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme. Thirty-six examinations of sick employees were also made during the year and reports submitted thereon. Registration of Hairdressers' Premises Sixty-two premises are registered under Section 18(1) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. Inspections are made to ensure that the bye-laws are observed. 38 Vaccination Certificates Six hundred and thirty five certificates by Medical Practitioners in in respect of people travelling abroad were authenticated. Conferences The Council was represented at Conferences during the year as follows: Royal Society for the Promotion of Health—Eastbourne Councillor J. F. W. Waldon, Public Health Committee. National Society for Clean Air—Scarborough Councillor J. F. W. Waldon, Public Health Committee, and Mr. J. E. Waring, Clean Air Officer.
