REPORT ON THE Sanitary Condition OF THE PARISH OF BERMONDSEY, for the year 1894, BY JOHN DIXON, M.D. Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, Licentiate in Midwifery, etc. Fellow of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE PARISH. LONDON: Printed by Bean, Webley & Co., Long Lane, S.E. 1895. ANNUAL REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE VESTRY OF BERMONDSEY. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, My Nineteenth Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the Parish of Bermondsey embraces the period of 52 weeks that ended on the 29th day of December, 1894. The year compares favourably with that which preceded it, as there were 270 fewer deaths. Of this gain the largest proportion was due to a considerable diminution in the number of deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs. This, no doubt, was due to the milder temperature which prevailed during the first and last quarters of the year. There were also fewer deaths from tubercular diseases, diseases of the brain and nervous system, and infantile diseases generally. Measles and whooping cough were both prevalent during the first half of the year. Diphtheria and diarrhœa were less fatal than in the previous year. Eight cases of smallpox were notified, and one death from this disease occurred in hospital. Influenza appeared at the beginning and end of the year and caused 9 deaths. The ordinary method of estimating the population by supposing that the increase or decrease which had been found to exist at the end of one period of ten years will be steadily maintained, year by year, for the ten succeeding years, is not infallible. When applied to the entire country, or to London, it affords a very close approximation to the truth, because a great rise in the population of some districts is counterbalanced by a corresponding decline in that of others, and thus an average result is obtained. When applied to a single parish of moderate extent, it is less exact, as the normal growth of the population may be interfered with by local circumstances, such as the clearance of unsanitary areas, the erection of large blocks of artisans' dwellings, and the state of trade in the place. Our natural increase of population, or excess of births over deaths, was 1361, but for statistical purposes we are not justified in assuming a greater population than was ascertained at the 4 last census. On the 1st September the Leather Market and St. Mary Magdalen Districts were amalgamated. The number of inhabitants in that portion of the parish is estimated at 30,600. In St. James' District there are probably 54,000 persons, making a total for Bermondsey of 84,600. BIRTHS. The total number of births registered in the parish was 3,095, being 94 less than in the previous year. In the Leather Market District there were 1,191 births and in St. James' 1,904. The number of children born in the first quarter of the year was 188; in the second quarter 730; in the third quarter 713 ; and in the last quarter 834. The annual birth rate per thousand of the estimated population in the Leather Market District was 38.9; in St. James' District 35.2; and for the whole Parish 36.5. The birth rate in London was 30.1, being the lowest on record. DEATHS. The deaths from all causes recorded in Bermondsey numbered 1,305, and of parishioners in outlying institutions 429, making a total of 1,734. In the previous year the total deaths were 2,004, of which 1,596 took place in Bermondsey, and 408 in hospitals. The deaths recorded in the Leather Market District were 508, and in St. James' 797. In each quarter of the year the deaths were below the average of the corresponding quarters in the three previous years. The death rate, calculated on the deaths which took place in the parish, was 15.4; the death rate for deaths in hospitals, asylums, infirmaries, &c, was 5.0; the rate for the total deaths was 20.4. The death rate in London was 17.8 per thousand of the population. This rate was lower by 2.6 than the average rate in the previous ten years. The number of deaths of children under 1 year of age in Bermondsey was 420, and in public institutions 31, making a total of 451 These deaths are equal to a rate of 146 per thousand children born. The like rate in London was 143, the average of 10 years being 154. CAUSES OF DEATH. The chief diseases of the zymotic class caused 189 deaths in the parish, and 90 in outlying institutions, making a total of 279. Including the hospital cases, there were 79 deaths from measles, 66 from diphtheria, 51 from whooping cough, 42 from diarrhœa, and 16 from enteric fever. There was 1 death from smallpox, and 1 from typhus, both of these took place in hospitals. The zymotic death rate in Bermondsey was 3.29. The same rate in London was 2.66. 90 per cent, of these deaths in the parish were of children under 5 years of age. Our proportion of children at that period of life exceeds that of London. In the class of septic diseases there were 15 deaths, including 6 of infants from congenital syphilis, and 6 deaths from erysipelas, 3 of which occurred in children under 1 year of age. Rheumatism and rheumatic fever caused 6 deaths and gout 1. There were 27 deaths from cancer in the parish, and 15 in hospitals. There Were 11 fewer deaths from cancer than in the previous year. In the tubercular order of diseases there were 181 deaths, against 236 in 1893. They included 103 deaths from phthisis, 46 from meningitis, and 11 from tabes mesenterica. In addition to these, there were 88 deaths in outlying institutions, of which 69 were from phthisis. Premature birth was assigned as the cause of 47 deaths of infants, being 19 less than that of the previous year. Four children died from congenital malformations, and 77 persons from old age, 22 of the latter dying in infirmaries outside the parish. Disease of the brain and nervous system caused 78 deaths in the parish and 41 in the hospitals. There were 48 deaths from apoplexy and 17 from paralysis. From convulsions there were 32 deaths against 66 in the previous year. From diseases of the heart and circulatory organs there were 70 deaths in the parish and 32 outside. Disease of the respiratory system contribute very largely to the general mortality. They caused 414 deaths in the parish and 54 in the hospitals. No less than 256 were referred to pneumonia and 176 to bronchitis. There were 14 deaths from laryngitis or croup. Diseases of the digestive organs caused 48 deaths, those of the liver 19, and kidney diseases 20. There were 3 deaths from diabetes. Five women died from childbirth. In the large class of general diseases which are principally due to debility from birth and the improper feeding of young children, there were 75 deaths against 97 in the previous year. The deaths referred to violence numbered 30 in the parish and 20 in hospitals. They included 16 cases of suffocation of infants and 10 cases of suicide. Of the latter 3 died in hospitals. Seventynine inquests were held. Twenty-eight persons died in the workhouse, and 38 deaths were uncertified. Most of the latter were cases of infants who died within a few hours after birth. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. During the year 817 certificates were received, being 265 fewer than in the previous year. In the first quarter there were 148; in the second quarter 205; in the third quarter 258; and in the last quarter 206. The various forms of infectious disease were classed as follows: smallpox 8, scarlet fever 390, diphtheria 259, membranous croup 11, enteric fever 26, typhoid fever 28, continued fever 1, typhus 2, puerperal fever 1, erysipelas 91. The total deaths from these diseases, including hospital cases, were, smallpox 1, scarlet fever 23, diphtheria and membranous croup 66, enteric or typhoid fever 16, typhus 1, and erysipelas 6. It is very doubtful whether many of the cases certified as erysipelas should be included in the class of infectious diseases. SANITARY WORK. From the reports of the Chief Sanitary Inspector it is evident that the activity displayed in recent years has been fully maintained. Especial attention has been given to the reconstruction of drains, and testing their perfect condition in the most efficient manner. The number of houses and other premises inspected during the year ending Lady-day, 1895 was 8,698; 7,135 notices were issued for the execution of works which were deemed necessary to place them in a satisfactory sanitary condition. A very large number of houses found in a dirty and dilapidated condition were cleansed and repaired. The repairs in many instances are only of a temporary character, and no long time elapses before the attention of the Sanitary Officers has again to be directed to the same dwelling. Six hundred and thirty-four houses where infectious disease had prevailed were disinfected by the officials of the Vestry, and 56 under the direction of private medical practitioners. Seventy-one cases of overcrowding were abated and 110 houses were closed as unfit for human habitation. Many of the latter had not been occupied for a long time; 1.309 closets were repanned and trapped, and 234 were supplied with water. The number of defective drains which were reconstructed was 1,867, and of stopped drains cleared 171. Twenty cesspools were filled up. The reconstructed drains which were tested with water numbered 2,577. Eighty-five offensive accumulations were removed. The bakehouses, numbering 81, were all inspected. I found those which were reported to me as being the worst in the parish were in a clean and fairly satisfactory condition. Four hundred and forty-three roofs and 211 rain shoots were put in order; 1,055 houses had the underground floors ventilated by the insertion of air-bricks. In 1,267 instances the water used for flushing water closets was separated from that in use for other domestic purposes. Five hundred and twelve lots of bedding and 6,583 articles were disinfected under the superintendence of your officials. Seven hundred and fifty-nine copies of notification of infectious diseases were sent to schools where children attended from the houses in which the occurrence of infectious disease had been reported. A large number of articles of food, including beef, pork, fish, fowls and fruit, were seized by the Sanitary Inspector and destroyed. Eighty-two post-mortem examinations were made at the Vestry's mortuary. Factories and workshops were inspected, and many improvements in their sanitary condition carried out. Thanking the Vestry and my colleagues for the kind and valuable assistance which I have received, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN DIXON, M.D., L.R.C.P. Lond., M.R.C.S., &c., Medical Officer of Health. 133, Jamaica Road, Bermondsey. TABLE I. CAUSES OF DEATH. Registered in Bermondsey during the 52 weeks ending December 31st, 1894.

REPORT OF INSPECTOR OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting for your consideration my Annual Statement in regard to Houses Let in Lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, this being the Ninth Annual Report I have been privileged to bring under your notice on the subject. During the year 19 houses were recommended for registration, and 16 were by resolution of the Board placed under the Bye-laws; the owners of the other three took the necessary steps to comply with the requirements. The 19 houses, recommended for registration contained 150 rooms, and were occupied by 75 families, consisting of 389 persons; 34 rooms were overcrowded and deficient in the prescribed air space to the extent of 15159 cubic feet, showing an average deficiency of air space of 445 cubic feet each. Some of the houses were not overcrowded, but the floors were in such a dirty condition, and the proper cleansing of the houses so neglected, that the Board decided to place them under the Bye-laws, thus rendering the landlords and lodgers liable to penalties if they failed to keep their houses in a cleanly and wholesome condition. During the year notices have been served for the abatement of overcrowding, and 245 for the cleansing of passages, floors, wash-houses, waterclosets, and the remedying of other sanitary defects. The whole of these houses have a good supply of water direct from the main without the intervention of a cistern. The yards are well paved. The total number of houses now on the Register is 308. During the year 20 registered houses have been pulled down as unfit for human habitation. The Registered Houses are in the following Streets:- Alexis Street 1 Abbey Street 9 Arnold's Place 1 Albion Place 2 Alice Street 2 Aberdour Street 5 Ambrose Street 3 Anchor Street 1 Bell Court 12 Bermondsey New Road 1 Bermondsey Square 1 Bermondsey Wall 2 Brandon Street 1 Camperdown Place 4 Castles Buildings 1 Canal Row 1 Catlin Street 1 Chapel Place 2 Cherry Garden Street 3 Crosby Row 4 Crucifix Lane 1 Druid Street 3 Decima Street 2 East Lane 2 Elim Street 15 Fendall Street 1 Ferrand Street 4 Flockton Street 1 Foxlow Street 15 George's Court 1 The Grange 3 Grange Road 3 Grange Walk 6 Gedling Street 4 George Row 1 Green Walk 1 St James' Road 1 Javen's Buildings, Leroy Street, 3 blocks, 20 suites of rooms 3 Wood's Place 8 King's Arms Place 1 Leroy Street 13 Lamb Alley 3 Larnaca Street 3 Long Lane 5 Long Walk 1 Lucey Road 1 London Street 10 Lockyer Street 2 Lynton Road 1 Marigold Court 5 Marigold Place 1 Marigold Street 4 Marshalls Place 4 Matilda Place 2 Medley's Place 2 Mellick's Place 7 Millstream Road 1 Minto Street 4 Napoleon Passage 2 Neckinger Street 2 Nelson Street 4 Osborne Buildings 1 Page's Walk 2 Parker's Buildings 6 Pleasant Place 1 Porlock Place 5 Paulin Street 1 Riley Street 1 Rolls Road 1 Rouel Road 1 Russell Place 1 Salisbury Street 19 Salisbury Place 10 Ship and Mermaid Row 2 Snowsfields 3 Spa Road 3 Staple Street 4 Stephenson's Court 2 Tanner Street 2 Turner's Retreat 1 Vauban Street 2 Victoria Place 1 West Lane 5 West Grove 2 Weston Street 5 Wilderness Street 2 Williams Square 1 Wolseley's Buildings (8 } 8 Blocks) } 8 Wells Street 2 Woolf Street 2 Wylds Rents 1 West Street i HENRY THOMAS, Assoc.

A letter has been received from the Clerk to the School Board for London stating that the teachers in Galleywall Road School are very much inconvenienced by offensive smells which emanate from a glue factory adjoining the school building, and requesting that the Vestry will take steps to prevent the continuance of the nuisance complained of. The size factory of Johnson, Cole, Brier and Cordrey, is situate about 80 yards from the school, being separated by the intervening playground, a strip of garden ground, the office buildings, and a roadway. At the present time there are several tons of dry bones, hoofs, and limed glue pieces on the premises, but no accumulation of an offensive character. In the building where size is boiled there is a faint smell of size, but this is not perceptible outside I am informed that the vapour from the boilers is passed through the furnace. I have not found anything on which I can advise the Yestry to take legal proceedings, but a nuisance is liable to arise from time to time according to the manner in which the business is conducted, and as this is one of the offensive trades which are under the supervision of the London County Council the complaint should be brought under their notice. Complaint has been made of a nuisance on the premises of Alfred Bowes, spelter manufacturer, Wild's Rents. There is a low building with defective roof and sides; from each end and the roof issue clouds of white vapour, which can be smelt at some distance. Messrs. Shaw & Co., curriers and Japanners, believe that the smoke and dust are injurious to their business. If the matter cannot be dealt with as a smoke nuisance, I should advise that steps be taken to have the building properly enclosed, and that a suitable chimney be erected to consume the vapour. From the analysis by Mr. Bodraer of the well water at Messrs. Feaver, Long Walk, I am of opinion that the water is so organically polluted as to be injurious or dangerous to health, and that the well should be permanently closed. May 7th, 1894.

After a post-mortem examination, his death was attributed to "apoplexy supervening on acute indigestion." I have visited the premises and am satisfied that their condition had nothing whatever to do with the man's death. I have also inspected several bakehouses which were reported to me as being the worst in the parish, and I found all of them in a clean, fairly well ventilated, and proper sanitary state.

As this is the last meeting of the Vestry with which I have been associated as a member or an officer for a period of 27 years, I hope it will not be out of place for me as the senior officer, to thank the Board for the courteous attention which the suggestions of the Sanitary Staff have at all times received, and at the same time to express my conviction that, whatever party may have been in power, the Sanitary Laws have been invariably administered with the strictest justice and impartiality.
