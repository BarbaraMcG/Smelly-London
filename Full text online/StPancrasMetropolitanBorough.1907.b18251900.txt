FIFTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being the Report for the Year 1907. To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors,— 1.—IN TRODUCTION. I have the honour to present to you the Fifty-Second Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Although the Registration District of St. Pancras has remained practically the same area since 1856, except for a few adjustments of boundary described in the Report for the year 1900, the changes in the areas of the Registration Sub-Districts since the last mentioned date have been great. Changes were made in 1900, at the Census of 1901, and again in 1906, when the two southern Sub-Districts were amalgamated. So that now the four Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras, except for slight deviations of the outer boundary, coincide with the four Parliamentary Divisions. METEOROLOGICAL RECORDS. Here follow the Meteorological Records for the year as deduced from observations made at Greenwich and at Camden Square. METEOROLOGICAL TABLE FOR SAINT PANCRAS, 1907.

The Registrar-General reports in his Annual Summary for the year 1906, London, p. x?ii., that " The number of births registered in the year 1906 in the seven principal lying-in institutions situated within thy Metropolis were as follows:—Borough of St. Marylebone, Queen Char otte's Lying-in Hospital, 1646; Hackney, Salvation Army Maternity Hospital, 234; Holborn, British Lying-in Hospital, 506; Finsbury, City of London Lying-in Hospital, 622: Stepney, East End Mother's Home, 414; Lambeth, General Lying-in Hospital, 602; and Clapham Maternity Hospital, 421." These births were distributed with approximate accuracy to the several Boroughs in which the mothers resided previous to admission, and this course is now followed in each Annual Summary. The effect upon St. Pancras in 1907 was to increase the birth-rate from 23.1 per 1000 of population to 24.7. “An Act to provide for the early Notification of Births" received the Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1907. On the 2nd October, 1907,1 recommended in a Report that the Act should be adopted in St. Pancras. The Act was considered on the 2nd October and again on the 23rd October, when it was resolved to recommend to the Borough Council that instructions be given for the necessary procedure for the adoption of the Act in the Borough to be forthwith taken, and this resolution was adopted by the Borough Council on the 30th October. Pursuant to Statute, a month's notice was given, and the resolutions necessary for the adoption of the Act came before the Borough Council on the 18th December, 1907, when their consideration was adjourned. Accordingly, another month's notice was given, and the resolutions necessary for the adoption of the Act came before the Borough Council again on the 5th February, 1908, when they were adopted, together with a report dated Tuesday, 28th January, 1908, in which I set out in detail the reasons for its adoption. 23 Under the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1874, section I., it is the duty of the father and mother, and in their default of the occupier of the house, and of each person present at the birth or in charge of the child, to give information of the birth within forty-two days, but no penalty is incurred by any person other than the parents if it be not given within three months. the case of a death the time is limited to five days, and no stillborn child is permitted to be buried without the written certificate of a registered medical practitioner, or a prescribed form of declaration, or an inquest. (Section 18.) Under the Notification of Births Act, 1907, it is the duty of the father, if residing in the house, and of any person in Attendance upon the mother within six hours after the birth, to give notice of the birth within thirty-six hours after the birth. This practically means giving notice within two days. Thus it will be seen that the effect of the adoption of the Act of 1907 is simply to reduce the delay in the notification of l irths from weeks and months to days, as practically the same persons are required to give notice as under the Act of 1874. The organisation for helping those that most require and desire help is already in existence in St. Pancras, which is in this matter some years ahead of most other Boroughs. This organisation, under the guidance of the Medical Officer of Health, consists of a Woman Inspector assisted by a number of ladies acting as Voluntary Visitors, part consisting of professional women and part of women philanthropists. Since the autumn of 1905 there have been some 21 Women Philanthropists intermittently working for various periods, and 14 Professional Women working more regularly and for longer periods, about half of whom have since obtained public appointments. The procedure is to send to every mother an advice card and only to visit the poorest mothers in the poorest houses of the poorest streets. I have been personally thanked even by well-to-do fathers for the advice cards, and the Voluntary Visitors have always been made welcome by the poor mothers to whom they have tendered personal advice and assistance, or to whom they have directed the attention of charitable associations and institutions for assistance. In illegitimate cases the kindly assistance of sympathetic women has been much appreciated, and I have never known any infringement of confidence, any resentment of advice, or any refusal of offers of assistance. But the number of illegitimate cases is infinitesimally small as compared to the legitimate. Inspector Gardner, the Woman Inspector, who closely supervises the work of the Voluntary Visitors, reports most encouragingly of their cheerful reception and of the friendly exchange of confidences with mothers, and the death returns tell their own story of the steady diminution of the infantile mortality. In addition to this, in the spring of last year an Institution was started to supplement the work of the Borough Council—the St. Pancras Mothers' and Infants' Society, supported by Voluntary Contributions and Voluntary Workers, with a paid Woman Superintendent at its School for Mothers, 6 and 7, Chalton Street, Somers Town. The number of ladies who do voluntary work in connection with this institution is growing, and experienced philanthropists are giving both money and service to a scheme which they do not 24 hesitate to characterise as the best of its kind. This institution costs the Borough Council nothing; it educates expectant mothers, guides nursing mothers, assists both mothers and infants, and prevents them from falling now or later into illhealth, pauperism, and upon the poor-rate. All this work is essentially work for women and not for men. The Local Government Board approved of the adoption of the Notification of Births Act, and ordered it to come into operation on and after the 9th March, 1908. Action taken during the Year 1907. During the year the action taken with regard to the prevention of the mortality of suckling infants is summarised as follows:— W. S. E. N. Total. Total Births registered (majority within 2 months) 1435 963 1626 1460 5484 Births on Midwives Lists (within 2 weeks) 294 175 177 429 1075 Of the total births registered, the illegitimate numbered 247, about 4.5 per cent.

In comparing the two Congresses it will be observed that in the proceedings of the later Congress there was no resolution in reference either to expectant or to suckling mothers. REPORT OF THE WOMAN INSPECTOR. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. April 6th, 1908. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, During the year 1907, the work done in connection with the efforts to lessen the Infant Mortality of St. Pancras has continued on the same lines as shown at some length in my reports to you for the years 1905 and 1906. All the various measures employed with the object of inducing and prolonging natural feeding (e.g Distribution of Advice Cards; personal visits to Mothers; the referring of Mothers and Infants to Doctors, Hospitals, &c.) have been carried on this year as hitherto. In addition, the St. Pancras " School for Mothers," and " Babies' Welcome " (formally opened in July at the Town Hall Meeting, presided over by Lord Robert Cecil) has supplied a distinct want in the district, and has usefully supplemented the Infant-work carried on municipally; in that it is a place to which Babies (seen in the homes by myself or by the voluntary visitors) can be referred for weighing; and the Mothers for extra advice and teaching, and additional nourishment, when the Doctor orders this for the Nursing-mother; and the Fathers for a friendly talk and lecture, once a week, by a medical man. [Full details of the working of the "Welcome" are given in the small descriptive book entitled " A School for Mothers," published by Horace Marshall & Son]. 27 Voluntary Visitors.—During this year, as previously, a number of "Voluntary Visitors have usefully supplemented the work of the Public Health Department as regards Infant-visiting and the clerical work, consequent upon it. For part of the year Miss Neville and Miss Stewart again kindly arranged for some of their workers to pay Infant-visits for us, each week; and in addition, other ladies, fully qualified to be Sanitary Inspectors, or with nursing and midwifery qualifications, (viz.: Miss Anderson, Mrs. Brand, Miss Broderick, Miss Herskind, Miss Hartland, Miss Johnson, Miss McCleverty, Miss Moor, Miss Newcomb, Miss Ryan, Miss Stevens, and Miss Wetherell), have attended during the different parts of the year at the Town Hall, one or more days each week, and after the requisite instruction and supervision have done the visiting and clerical work allotted to them in a very satisfactory manner. Some who applied to come, but who were not sufficiently qualified, or, who for other reasons did not seem suitable, were not accepted. Though there are certain distinct advantages in getting the additional help of these qualified voluntary workers, varying in their experience, age and qualifications, yet much of my own time and energy has necessarily to be devoted to the securing, instructing and supervising of these helpers, who, after having been trained in St. Pancras methods, are generally successful in getting salaried posts, when new voluntary workers requiring fresh training take their place. Mode of Visiting.—As before, I would like again to urge strongly that it has always been my object to ensure that the visits to the Mothers and Infants should not be hurried ones, and merely involving a long series of questions, but that they should be made in a leisurely, tactful and sympathetic manner, so that subsequent visits shall be welcomed. It is well to specially emphasize this point, lest one may be tempted to aim at paying too large a number of visits perfunctorily, having in view quantity, rather than quality, as unfortunately there is an inclination sometimes to judge the work done by high numbers rather than by good results. Number of Births, Visits, Advice Cards, &c. Total Births registered (majority within 2 months) 5484 Births on Midwives' List (majority within 2-4 weeks) 1034 Advice Cards sent after, and previous to, Births 6000 Number of Visits paid:— 2934 Actual number of Infants visited 1855 Additional visits to Infants*1079 *of these Infants " not known '' at address given 100 Infants " removed " from address given 105 Extra visits made by myself to Hospitals, Doctors, Midwives, Nurses, Creches, Maternity Missions, Almoners, Relieving Officers, Workhouse, Infirmary, Employment Exchange, Office of Distress Committee, " School for Mothers," Charity Organization Society, Dairy-shops, Chemists, &c., &c. *249 * This number would have been considerably higher, if it could have included all the " visits " which had perforce, for press of time, to be replaced by letters and appointments here at the Town Hall. 28 Tables as to Modes of Feeding.—The attached tables A1 and A2, B1 and B2 show— (1) The mode of feeding of Infants visited, at the particular month of age stated, during the year 1907.

Complete and current indexes of these have been made throughout the year. Further, an index has been kept of all the births attended by Midwives (as seen in the returns from the London County Council), as a comparison of these with the Registrar's returns has been necessary each week, so as to avoid duplication, both in sending out Advice Cards and in paying visits. A full index has also been made each quarter of all the visits paid ; by reference to which I have been able to tell at once, on what date, and by which visitor, any particular baby in St. Pancras has been seen, and to find the completely filled-in Inquiry Form relating to that case. Quarterly reports have also been submitted to you as to the number of Births, Visits, Inquiries, &c. As St. Pancras methods are more and more widely known, the daily correspondence dealing with Infant mortality prevention, and the organization of voluntary visitors has become increasingly large. It is thus easy to be seen that the clerical work in connection with the Infant inquiry is now much greater in amount and more complicated in character than it was in the beginning. Voluntary Notification of Births.—The voluntary notification of Births within 2 days, which was in force for 4 months of the year 1906, did not extend to the year 1907 ; though the practical experience gained in that short time has since been of valuable assistance in making arrangements for putting into effect the 1907 Notification of Births' Act, which came into force in St. Pancras, March 9th, 1908. However, though early voluntary notification had ceased elsewhere, the St. Pancras Workhouse kindly continued to notify the births in their Lyingin-ward to the Public Health Department within 2 days, and in each instance an Advice Card was at once sent in an envelope, directed to the mother; and this attention was appreciated by her. It is a matter of regret that in the Workhouse (illegitimate) cases, the Father of the child cannot be compelled to undertake the responsibility of so maintaining the Mother that she need not be separated from her Infant during the suckling period; and also that, where the Mother is mentally defective, she cannot be detained, instead of being dismissed at the end of a few weeks, only to return for her next confinement. Infant Mortality in St. Pancras.—St. Pancras, like other Boroughs, has reaped the benefits in the year 1907 of a favourable summer, and so, owing to that and other reasons, is again able to shew a diminished Infant death-rate. For judging on the same basis of births and Infant deaths, the Infant mortality in 1904, 1905, 1906, and 1907 has been 152, 136, 131 and 114, respectively. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, Blanche Gardinef, Sanitary Inspector. 32 HI-INFECTIOUS DISEASES. § 1.—DISCOVERY AND DIAGNOSIS. It is well to know that unrecognised cases largely spread infectious diseases. Discovery.—Mild cases of indisposition or disease excite no particular attention, or are attributed to other than the real cause by parents, guardians, or friends, and are not submitted to medical examination. In the autumn there are generally several instances of parents and guardians failing to recognise as infectious cases of slight disturbances of health in children until other children become infected and develop typical symptoms. When cases of suspected infectious diseases occur there is sometimes considerable difficulty and delay in making an exact medical diagnosis in certain types of the diseases. Here bacteriological and additional clinical examination are brought to bear upon doubtful types, and to check or confirm the diagnosis. Bactcriological Tests.—The number of specimens of secretion, blood and sputum submitted to bacteriological tests during the year in suspected cases of Diphtheria, Typhoid or Enteric Fever, and Tuberculosis, and the results of examination were as follows:— Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Diphtheria (Secretion) 27 .. 44 71 Reaction obtained. Doubtful. Reaction not obtained. Total. Typhoid (Blood) 10 .. 18 28 Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Tuberculosis (Sputum) 9 .. 24 33 Infectious Diseases fall into four categories— (a) Permanent compulsorily notifiable diseases, (b) Permanent voluntarily notifiable diseases, (c) Temporary compulsorily notifiable diseases, and (d) Non-notitiable diseases. 33 § 2—NOTIFICATION AND DISEASES.

This matter was considered by the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health in 1906, and it was decided that it was undesirable to take any steps to remove erysipelas from the list of notifiable diseases. 38 CEREBROSPINAL FEVER. Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis or Cerebro-Spinal Fever was made a compulsorily notifiable disease in London under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, by a resolution of the County Council on the 26th February, 1907, which came into effect on the 12th March. This rendered it unnecessary to proceed any further with the resolution of the Borough Council of the 6th February to the same effect. Extracts from Memorandum on Cerebro-Spinal Fever, issued by the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board in July, 1905, were quoted in the Annual Report for 1906. The number of cases of the disease notified in St. Pancras during the year was five. In at least three of the cases there was a vague history of injury to the head. CONSUMPTION (PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS). Deaths from Consumption. The number of deaths in St. Pancras from the pulmonary form of Tuberculosis during each of the last five years, at several ages, has been as follows:— Tuberculous Phthisis, Pulmonary Phthisis, and Phthisis.

A Conference of representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils, convened by the Paddiugton Borough Council, " on the question of taking measures to limit the spread of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) " was held at the Town Hall, Paddington, on the 6th June. Twenty-six City and Borough Councils, out of 29, were represented by 61 delegates ; the Mayor of Paddington presided. The following resolutions were passed:— " That it is desirable that the notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) should be compulsory. " That application be made to the Local Government Board for an Order to be made— (i) To include Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) among the diseases to be notified under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 ; and (ii) To extend the provisions of the following Sections of the above Act to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption)— Section 60—Cleansing and disinfecting of premises, &c. „ 61—Disinfection of bedding, &c. ,, 62 — Infectious rubbish thrown into ash-pits, &c., to be disinfected. „ 63—Penalty on letting houses in which infected persons have been lodging. „ 64—Penalty on persons letting houses making false statements, as to infectious disease. ,, 65—Penalty on ceasing to occupy house without disinfection, or notice to owner, or making false answer. " That it is desirable, in order to limit the spread of Tuberculosis, that provision should be made for public inspection and control, at its several sources, of the milk supply of England, and to ask the Local Government Board to take steps to secure the efficient administration of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885, and Orders amending the same." " That application be made to the Local Government Board for an Order to be made to extend the provisions of Section 69 of the Public Health (London) Act to Pulmonary Tuberculosis, in so far as it relates to the milkinsr of cows and to the sale and distribution of milk." " That the provision conferred by Section 7 (1) of the Factory and "Workshop Act, 1901, namely, that in every room in any factory or workshop sufficient means of ventilation shall be provided and sufficient ventilation maintained, be rigidly enforced, and a similar provision extended to all places where people are assembled together for any lengthened period, with a view to restricting the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis." 41 " (a) That a Sanatorium is needed for the open-air treatment of poor persons suffering from Pulmonary Consumption, in the early stages of the disease, and should be provided by a Central Authority acting for the Metropolis as a whole. " (6) That the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, by reason of their practical experience in the management of hospitals for infectious disease, being eminently qualified for the position of such authority, the Local Government Board be requested to confer on, or if necessary, to obtain for, the said Managers power to act in that capacity. " (c) That the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should also be empowered to use, for sanatorium purposes, the 'Southern Hospital,' recently erected by them at Carshalton, in the County of Surrey." That the Government be urged to provide " a sum of money annually for the erection and maintenance of suitable Sanatoria for the treatment of early cases of consumption." It was also resolved " That the President of the Local Government Board be asked to receive a deputation from the Conference in support of the above resolutions, and that he be urged to take such steps as may be necessary to give effect to them," and a deputation was appointed. SANATORIUM ACCOMMODATION. In October, 1907, Mr. Joseph Thornley, J.P., a representative of the St. Pancras Board of Guardians on the Metropolitan Asylums Board, moved at a meeting of the latter— " That the Board's resolution of the 27th April, 1907, deferring for twelve months further consideration of the question of the purpose to which the Southern Hospital should be applied, be and is hereby rescinded. "That, subject to the sanction of the Local Government Board, the Southern Hospital be opened for the accommodation and treatment of consumptive cases in the early stages, chargeable to the Metropolitan Boards of Guardians." These proposals were not adopted, and in November the St. Pancras Board of Guardians requested the Local Government Board to favourably consider a suggestion for the Metropolitan Asylums Board to be authorised, as a temporary arrangement, to admit into one of their Hospitals patients suffering from phthisis. The Guardians stated that there were 134 at one of their Infirmaries, that both Infirmaries were occupied beyond the certified limit. On the 8th January, 1908, the Local Government Board replied that it was inexpedient to sanction the proposal at the present time, even as a temporary measure, as the proposal involves many questions that will have to be dealt with by the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws, which is now sitting. 42 WOMAN INSPECTOR'S REPORT. Re Inquiry into Cases of Consumption voluntarily notified during the year 1907. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I submit a report on the work done during the year 1907 in connection with the voluntary notification of Consumption. By far the greatest number of notifications came from the various officers of the Guardians. Although little can be done for the actual patients so notified, these notifications are very valuable. The families of such patients are often much in need of such information as can be given by this Authority. The dwellings from which the patients have been removed are often those in which disinfection or special cleansing is most required, and the cases are interesting from the investigation point of view, combining, as they often do, the medical, economic, social and moral factors in the consumption problem. Many of these cases are by no means of the pauper class; they are driven to the Infirmary because no other institution is open to them. No difficulties have arisen in connection with the work, and the visits have been well received. Great care is, however, necessary in dealing with persons in these distressing circumstances. In no case is the investigation so pressed as to be painful to the patient or annoying to the famity. Disinfection after the removal or death of a patient has always been advised, but no attempt has been made to excite great alarm as to the dangers of infection. To do so while the means of dealing with cases are utterly inadequate seems a useless type of cruelty. Where disinfection has been refused it has usually been possible to press for thorough cleansing and aeration of the rooms. In some blocks of dwellings the rooms are said to be fumigated after the removal of every tenant whether ill or well. In cases where the patient had previously been in Infirmary, Hospital or Sanatoriums the necessity for precaution was well understood. I have given careful attention to the following points:— (a) The beginning of the disease in the patient notified. (b) Cases of contacts apparently in danger of contracting the disease. (c) Means of helping affected individuals and families. (a) In a considerable number of cases the patient contracted consumption after recovery from some other disease. It seems desirable that convalescents should be advised to consult their doctor before, or soon after, returning to active work, even though their recovery appears to be fairly complete. The number of cases of " underfed " is noteworthy, and, coupled with the number of cases reported from Rowton Houses and common lodging houses, shows how close is the connection of this problem with social and economic questions. I have noted carefully the conditions of employment of the patients where this information could be obtained. A list of the occupations, classified mainly 43 according to the features said by the patients to have affected them injuriously, is attached. With regard to housing, the most important point is the usual absence of separate sleeping rooms for the patients. In the table attached 63 persons are returned as sleeping in a room alone : but in many cases, probably two-thirds of the number, this room was, during the day, the living room of the whole family, the families occupying not more than two or three rooms and the consumptive's room generally being warmed by the only fire. (b) The opportunity of gaining access to the susceptible members of the family of a consumptive is one of the main advantages of the notification. Enquiry as to the health of the other members of the family is always made and the advisability of seeking medical advice without delay is impressed. The poor are referred to suitable agencies for help where necessary, and young persons are advised to join social clubs where, it is hoped, the responsible persons will feel some interest in their health. The care of the other members of a patient's family is among the portions of the work well worth development. It is not possible to prove this by statistics for this year's work for various reasons ; but in one part of the year in which more careful enquiry into this point was possible nearly one-third of the enquiries gave cases of contacts likely to become consumptives. (c) The further provisions required may be briefly stated:— (1) More special hospital accommodation for advanced cases, especially by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. (2) Home treatment for certain cases, including separate bedrooms for patients and in some cases also additional fat foods or cod liver oil. (3) After-care for patients returning from hospital or sanatorium or for patients treated at home, including attention to home conditions and to the provision of open air work or open workrooms. (4) Preventive treatment for the susceptible members of families known to be affected, and for convalescents generally, such as periodical medical examination, personal health measures, and timely recuperation at country convalescent homes. (5) Kitchens at which invalid food could be obtained. Many persons able to pay for such food are unable to obtain it or to cook it. (6) For children affected or in danger, special schools or special classes in existing schools. I have to acknowledge very gratefully help received from various individuals and organisations in the district for the individual cases referred to them, and I believe that if these various agencies could be brought into co-operation for the further dealing with the difficulties of this disease much valuable work might be done. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, M. E. Bibby, Sanitary Inspector. 44 Residence notified:— Rowton House, Arlington Road 13 Rowton House, King's Cross Road 16 Common Lodging Houses 8 Workhouse 3 Private houses 268 308 Ages of patients notified :— Under 5 1 5—10 8 10—15 7 15—20 12 20-30 57 Earliest noted impairment of health : Poverty, under-feeding . . 11 Continued exposure to bad weather 8 Unhealthy Workshop conditions 9 Continued exposure to tuberculous inspection 33 Delicate from infancy 7 Pleurisy, pneumonia, bronchitis 10 Whooping cough 1 Gout (lead) 1 Scarlet fever 1 Previous cases in family:— Known 66 Not known 110 No information 132 Patient at time of visit resident at:— Address notified 115 Removed to Workhouse Infirmary 148 Removed to Hospitals, &c 8 Removed to the country 3 Dead at Public Institutions 4 Dead at Private Addresses 18 Not known 12 308 30—40 67 40—50 77 50—60 44 60-70 20 Not stated 15 Accident 5 Peritonitis 1 Defectives 2 Mental shock or distress 3 Influenza 2 Drink 4 Abscesses 1 Rheumatic fever 1 No inquiry 113 No information. 93 Probable susceptible persons in family— Known 39 No information 269 Sleeping Arrangements of Patients.

On the 23rd August, 1907, the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries made a new Order known as " The Glanders or Farcy Order of 1907," and on the 12th September made a further Order, known as the " London (Notification of Glanders) Order of 1907," of which Article 2 (Notice of Disease) is substituted for Article 3 (Notice of Disease) of the Glanders or Farcy Order of 1907 in the application of that Order to the Administrative County of London and to the City of London. On the 29th November, 1907, under the " Diseases of Animals Act" and the Glanders or Farcy Order of 1907, the London Connty Council made Regulations as to Glanders or Farcy," and appended to the Regulations a Memorandum of the " Symptoms of, and precautions as to, Glanders." This Memorandum contains a series of paragraphs relating to human glanders, to the following effect:— Human Glanders. All persons who have anything to do with glandered or farcied animals should bear in mind the following facts:— The disease can be communicated to man by discharge from the nostrils or other parts of a diseased animal or carcase. The disease in man is almost always fatal. It is specially dangerous for persons with scratches or sores on the hands or face to handle diseased horses or carcases. By care and strict attention to cleanliness the danger of inoculation is avoidable. These Orders and Regulations came into force on the 1st January, 1908. Bv Article 2 (5) of the London Order an Inspector of the Local Authority (the London County Council) who receives information of the existence or suspected existence of disease must forthwith report the fact to the Local Authority, and also to the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary District in which the animal died or was slaughtered, or in which the carcase was at the time of the notice. 46 § 3.—ISOLATION AND EXCLUSION.

EXCLUSION OF DIPHTHERIA CONVALESCENTS FROM SCHOOL. In April, 1906, the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health considered the mode of the spread of Diphtheria in Schools, and decided " that it is desirable that in the event of the prevalence of diphtheria in any district, any child excluded from school for sore-throat should not be admitted to school without a certificate of freedom from infection based on bacteriological examination." In July the Education Committee passed the following resolution, which was adopted by the County Council—" That the Education Committee be authorised to refuse, during the presence of diphtheria in any district,, re-admission to school of children excluded on account of diphtheria or sorethroat until such children shall have obtained a medical certificate of freedom from infection based on a bacteriological examination." CLOSURE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OR EXCLUSION OF PARTICULAR CHILDREN. In January, 1908, the Local Government Board issued a revised " Memorandum on the circumstances under which the Closing of Public Elementary Schools or the Exclusion therefrom of particular Children may be required in order to prevent the Spread of Disease." This Memorandum relates both to Notifiable and Non-Notifiable Diseases. SAINT PANCRAS, LONDON. WEEKLY NUMBER OF CASES OF "THE DANGEROUS INFECTIOUS DISEASES" REMOVED FOR ISOLATION DURING 1907.

The Midwives Act, 1902 (2 Edw. 7, c. 17), section 3, provides for the formation of a Central Midwives Board, of which "The duties and powers of the Board shall be as follows 1. To frame rules. (e) regulating, supervising, and restricting within due limits the practice of midwives; The Rules framed by the Central Midwives Board in accordance with section 3, sub-section 1 of the Midwives Act, 1902, and approved by the Privy Council on the 12th August, 1903, for a period of three years, provide under the heading (e) regulating, supervising, and restricting within due limits the practice of midwives, and the sub-heading, Directions to Midwives, paragraph 5, "whenever a midwife has been in attendance upon a patient suffering from puerperal fever, or from any other illness supposed to be infectious, she must disinfect herself and all her instruments and other appliances, to the satisfaction of the local sanitary authority, and must have her clothing thoroughly disinfected before going to another labour. Unless otherwise directed by the local supervising authority, all washable clothing should be boiled, and other clothing should be sent to be stoved (by the local authority), and then exposed freely to the open air for several days." The Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, in order to define "the satisfaction of the local authority," in July, 1906, suggested Regulations for guidance (see Public Health, August, 1906, p. 636). Suggested Regulations for the Disinfection of Midwives after attendance upon patients suffering from Puerperal Fever. Personal Disinfection. The midwife, after attending a septic case, should take a complete hot bath, including the thorough washing of the hair.' Disinfection of Hands:—The careful disinfection of the hands requires strict attention. The nails should be trimmed. The hands shoidd be washed with soap and water, rinsed in clean water, soaked in methylated spirit, and finally soaked in a solution of Corrosive Sublimate (1 in 1000) or other equally efficient disinfectant for about ten minutes. Disinfection of Clothing. All articles of clothing worn while attending a septic case should be changed for entirely fresh ones, the used clothing being handed over to the Sanitary Authority for disinfection. Disinfection of Apparatus. The bag and apparatus used by the midwife should be handed over to the Sanitary Authority for disinfection. 49 It is considered advisable that gum elastic catheters and syringes should be destroyed and replaced by the Sanitary Authority. Metal and other articles which will not be injured by the process should be boiled. The lining of the bag should be removed and destroyed, while the bag itself should be washed with corrosive sublimate (1 in 1000) or other equally efficient disinfectant. Suggested Form of Certificate. I Hereby Certify that who has recently been in attendance upon a patient suffering from "Puerperal Fever" has undergone personal cleansing and disinfection, and that her clothing, instruments, and other apparatus have been disinfected by the Sanitary Authority to my satisfaction. (Signed) Medical Officer of Health. The Central Midwives Board have made new rules for "E—regulating, supervising, and restricting within due limits the practice of Midwives," which bear no date, except the printer's date, 8/07, and paragraph 5 runs— "Whenever a Midwife has been in attendance upon a patient suffering from puerperal fever, or from any other illness supposed to be infectious, she must disinfect herself and all her instruments and other appliances, to the satisfaction of the Local Supervising Authority, and must have her clothing thoroughly disinfected before going to another labour. Unless otherwise directed by the Local Supervising Authority, all washable clothing should be boiled, and other clothing should be sent to be disinfected by the Local Sanitary Authority." The form of certificate adopted in St. Pancras in 1903 was set out in the Annual Report for 1904, page 44, under the heading of Contact with dangerous infectious disease. In the printed "Notice to persons in contact with dangerous infectious diseases," circulated in St. Pancras in connection with the Contact Shelter the paragraph relating to midwives was as follows:— A midwife, after attending upon a patient suffering from puerperal fever or from any other illness supposed to be infectious, by the rules of the Central Midwives Board, must disinfect herself and all her instruments and other appliances to the satisfaction of the local Sanitary Authority, and must have her clothing thoroughly disinfected before going to another labour. For this purpose the baths and disinfecting chamber at the Contact Shelter are available, and after cleansing and disinfection a midwife is given a certificate to the effect that she has undergone personal cleansing (including hair and nails) in a warm bath, that her personal clothing has undergone disinfection or destruction, that her hands have been specially disinfected by soaking in methylated spirit and in solution of perchloride of mercury (1 in 1,000), and that the instruments brought with her have been sterilised or destroyed, namely, the gum elastic instruments and parts destroyed, metal and other articles steamed, the lining of the bag destroyed and the rest of the bag washed with corrosive sublimate solution. 50 CLEANSING STATION.

In reference to this subject the following Report of the General Purposes Committee of the County Council was made to the County Council on the 4th February, 1908:— 27th January, 1908. Cleansing of verminous persons—References to committees. 1.—Part V. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907,* provides for the cleansing by the Council of verminous persons in common lodging-houses, and of verminous children, and for arrangements to be made with the several sanitary authorities with regard to the use, for carrying out such cleansing, of the premises and appliances belonging to or used by such authorities. The provisions of the Act which relate to the cleansing of inmates of common lodging-houses should be administered by the Public Health Committee, who exercise the powers of the Council relating to such houses, while the Education Committee should deal with the cleansing of verminous children. It is, however, desirable that the arrangements with sanitary authorities should be made by the Council through one committee, and. it has been agreed that the Public Heath Committee shall make the necessary arrangements. We recommend— (a) That the order of reference to the Public Health Committee be amended by the insertion of the following after item (2) in paragraph 2— The Committee shall exercise the powers of the Council under— Part V. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, with respect to verminous inmates of common lodging-houses, * In Part VI. (Legislation) of this Annual Report Part V. of the London County Council (General Towers) Act, 1907, is set out. 52 and the Committee shall have authority to enter into agreements or arrangements with sanitary authorities respecting the cleansing of verminous persons: provided that all regulations under the said part of the Act with regard to verminous inmates of common lodginghouses shall be made by the Council on the recommendation of the Committee. (b) That an addition as follows be made to the order of reference to the Education Committee— Subject to the provisions of the order of reference to the Public Health Committee, the Education Committee shall exercise the powers of the Council under Part V. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, with respect to verminous children attending school: provided that members of the Committee who are not for the time being members of the Council shall not act or vote in respect of any question arising under the said part of the Act, and that regulations under the said part of the Act and exclusively affecting such children shall be made by the Council on the recommendation of the Committee. Subsequently the following letter was received:— County Hall, Spring Gardens, 12th February, 1908. Sir, Cleansing of verminous Persons. Cleansing of Children. I am directed to call attention to sections 36 and 37 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, with reference to the cleansing of verminous persons. It will be observed that section 36 gives statutory power to the County Medical Officer or any other person authorised by him (a) to examine the person and clothing of any child attending any school provided or maintained by the Council to ascertain whether the person or clothing of such child is infested with vermin or is in a foul or filthy condition: (b) to require the parent or other person responsible for such child to effect the cleansing of the person and clothing of the child within 24 hours of the notice to that effect, and (c) on default of such parent or other responsible person, to remove the child from the school and to cause the person and the clothing of such child to be properly cleansed in suitable premises and with suitable appliances and to detain there such child until such cleansing has been effected: and that section 37 enables the Medical Officer, or any other person authorised by him, (a) to enter any lodging house and examine the person and clothing of any person whom he has reason to suspect of being infested with vermin or in a foul or dirty condition, (b) to require such person to submit his person and clothing to be cleansed at specific suitable premises within 24 hours of notice of such requirement, and (c) on default of such person, to remove him to suitable premises for the purpose of effecting the cleansing, and to detain him there until it has been effected. The Council believes that the St. Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council will agree that it is absolutely necessary that any arrangements made for carrying the Act into effect shall provide for dealing separately not only with men and women but also with boys and girls. The Council recognises that children in 53 most cases belong to an entirely different class from that to which the adult person requiring cleansing belongs, and separate days or hours should be appointed for their reception, or particular rooms allocated to them, in order to avoid the risk of the children coming into contact with obviously undesireable adults. These are the most important points arising in connection with the new powers conferred upon the Council. Before making any definate arrangements to put the Act into force, it is necessary that the Council should obtain the fullest possible information as to the extent of the provision already existing, the method of disinfection of verminous clothing and of dealing with a verminous condition of the hair ; the arrangements in regard to the supervision by the cleansing staff; and the facilities which the Metropolitan Borough Council would be prepared to afford the Council in the matter. I am therefore to say that the Council will be obliged if the St. Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council will at the earliest possible moment favour the Council with information on the points just referred to, and will indicate also what facilities can be afforded to the Council in its administration of the sections of the Act in question. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, G. L. Gomme, Clerk of the Council. The Education Committee of the County Council in a Report dated 26th February, 1908, reported to the County Council on the 3rd March, 1908, as follows:— Cleansing of Children. 41.—Part V. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, provides for the cleansing by the Council of verminous persons in common lodging-houses, and of verminous children attending school. The General Purposes Committee, in reporting on this part of the Act, stated that the provisions which relate to the cleansing of inmates of common lodging-houses should be administered by the Public Health Committee, whilst those that deal with the cleansing of verminous children should be administered by us. The General Purposes Committee, however, stated that they considered it desirable that the arrangements with sanitary authorities should be made by (he Council through one Committee, namely, the Public Health Committee. The Council subsequently amended the orders of reference to the Public Health and Education Committees in this sense. In these circumstances, we desire to draw attention to the urgent necessity for such arrangements being made in regard to the cleansing of children as will prevent the possibility of their coming into contact with adults. School children who need cleansing in most cases belong to an entirely different class from that to which the adult persons requiring cleansing belong. The verminous child is the victim of circumstances beyond the child's control, and, notwithstanding its condition, may not have lost its sense of self-respect, whilst the verminous vagrant has probably male his own circumstances and probably lost all sense of self- 54 respect and of the decencies of life. In order, therefore, to avoid the risk of children coming into contact with obviously undesirable adults, it is essential that the children who would necessarily be cleansed in the day time should be provided for at an establishment removed from the neighbourhood of that at which adults are cleansed. In the draft letter to various local sanitary authorities which we recently forwarded to the Public Health Committee, we emphasised this fact; but we regret to find that in the letter sent to the sanitary authorities the statement that it was essential that children should be cleansed at an establishment removed from that for adults was omitted. The letter, as altered, was sent out without our being consulted, and we only knew of the omission after the letter had already gone. The danger of sending children to common cleansing stations arises from the fact that most of these stations are in lonely situations, or in places difficult of access, and that there is a likelihood of tramps loitering about the roads leading to them. There are, moreover, several cleansing stations where shelters are provided at which persons are temporarily accommodated whilst their houses are being cleaned. It should also be borne in mind that there is reasonable excuse for parents refusing to allow their children to go to these isolated stations alone when as often happens to parents in poor circumstances they have not time themselves to take the children. We have in mind one cleansing station, situated in a lonely road, which provides for a densely-populated district. At this station during the present year 500 tramps have attended. There is no separate station provided in this district, nor as far as we are aware, with a single exception,* in any other district for the adequate cleansing of children. We desire to take this opportunity of stating, with the full sense of the Council's responsibility for the safeguarding of the children, that we cannot view without misgiving the serious risks which little children would run in attending, especially during the dark days of winter, the cleansing stations resorted to by tramps and other undesirable persons, nor can we regard with equanimity the position which would be occupied by the Council if any harm were to arise to children from such persons in connection with the children's visits under the Council's orders to the cleansing stations. For these reasons we desire that the Council should be informed that in our opinion it is undesirable that school children should be sent to cleansing stations attended by verminous adults. ADDITIONAL PLANS FOR THE CLEANSING STATION. In consequence of the increased number of baskets of clothing requiring to be stoved at frequent intervals during the day, and the excessive wear and tear in using the large steam chambers for such small parcels, it became desirable to consider the installation of a small steam chamber to relieve the larger chambers. Also, in consequence of the large number of baths taken and the greater amount of steam and hot water used, it was considered desirable to substitute for the two fires and the gas geyser a single boiler to produce * This single exception is the Borough of St. Pancras. 55 more economically all the steam and hot water requisite for the Disinfecting Station, Contact Shelter, Personal Cleansing House, and Children's Baths. DISINFECTANTS—STANDARDISATION. In June, 1907, H.M. Office of Works decided that Contractors would not be invited to tender for proprietory Disinfectants unless the undermentioned conditions were complied with: — "The disinfectant will be examined chemically and bacteriologically. The chemical examination will be made at the Government Laboratory free of charge. For the bacteriological examination the fee must be borne by the proprietor of the disinfectant submitted, and be deposited with the application for approval." "A scheme for the bacteriological examination of disinfectants has been drawn up, and the examination of all disinfectants submitted for test will be conducted strictly in accordance with such scheme. Disinfectants will be tested against B. typhosus with Phenol as a standard." "On the completion of the chemical and bacteriological examination, the applicant will be informed whether or not the disinfectant has been approved, but in no case will details of the results of the examination be furnished." In tendering for disinfectants the Corporation of the City of London require compliance with the following specification:— "Any disinfectant fluid may be tendered for, provided that its guaranteed bacteriological efficiency is expressed in terms of absolute Phenol (100 per cent.), as determined by the Ridcal-Walker method, when working with vigorous cultures of bacillus typhosus, and that it is homogeneous, mixible with water in all proportions, does not separate out on standing, and runs freely from the cask at all times." 56 § 5.

On the Clerical Staff, Mr. H. E. Read was transferred to the Works Department, Mr. Samuel May promoted to his place, and Mr. R. W. Harmer appointed to the place caused by the promotion. On the Inspectorial Staff, on the 7th March, 1906, the Borough Council had resolved that the Special Inspector cease to inspect disinfected rooms, and that the District Inspectors undertake this duty. That the Special Inspector continue to superintend the Disinfecting Station, Contact Shelter, and Cleansing Station, and that he be given a District (the Town Hall District) formed of part of Wards 3 and 6 in which to carry out the duties of District Inspector and Food Inspector, and that it be also his duty to accompany other Inspectors where confirmation of a drain test is necessary. On the 17th July, 1907, the Borough Council resolved to relieve the Special Inspector of the supervision of the Disinfecting Station and created the Senior Disinfector Foreman of the Disinfecting and Cleansing Station. On the 18th December, 1907, the Special Inspectors' District was extended to include the whole of the College and Oakley Square Sub-Divisions (E 3, and 4) in which to carry out duties as Food Inspector and District Inspector. On the 31st July, 1907, the Borough Council resolved to dismiss a District Inspector for neglect of duty, &c., and on the 18th September, 1907, the Borough Council resolved not to appoint a Sanitary Inspector to fill the vacancy created. 65 The following is a tabular statement as to the Staff of the Public Health Department presented to the Borough Council on the 9th October, 1907 (p. 523):— "Staff of the Public Health Department.

(1) 1901.—Two permanent (January, 1901) and four temporary (October. 1901) Tenement House Inspectors and one Clerk (September, 1901) appointed. (2) 1903.—Two of the temporary Tenement House Inspectors were made permanent in November 1902, so that in 1903 there were four permanent Tenement House Inspectors, the appointment of the other temporary Inspectors lapsing. (3) 1905.—The temporary Woman Inspector appointed in September, 1904. was made permanent in November, 1905, and the temporary Clerk appointed in September, 1901, was made permanent in November, 1905." The foregoing summary requires to be supplemented in order to obtain a full and complete knowledge of the numerous changes that have taken place in the Inspectorial Staff, and it is necessary to go back two years more in order to commence at the beginning of the story. In 1898 there were ten Sanitary Inspectors, namely, eight District Inspectors (one to each Ward), and two Workshop Inspectors (one of whom was a woman). In 1898 and 1899 there was a long Inquiry and prolonged controversy with the London County Council and the Local Government Board as to the sufficiency of the staff, the London County Council recommending the start tobe increased by at least seven Inspectors together with additional clerical assistance. 66 On the 10th May, 1899 (p. 804), the Vestry resolved to appoint permanently two additional Sanitary Inspectors to inspect Foods and Food Places and to sample Foods and Drugs, the one in the North and East Divisions, and the other in the West and South Divisions. On the 19th July, 1899 (p. 79), the Vestry resolved to appoint temporarily two Sanitary Inspectors to carry out house to house inspection. These appointments lapsed. On the 19th December, 1900 (p. 224), the Borough Council resolved to appoint permanently two additional Sanitary Inspectors to inspect Tenement Houses. The one was allotted the North and East Divisions, the other the West and South Divisions of the Borough. On the 25th September, 1901 (p. 486), the Borough Council resolved to appoint temporarily four Sanitary Inspectors. The temporary Inspectors were re-appointed from time to time. On the 6th November, 1901 (p. 696), the Borough Council resolved that one of the Inspectors should act temporarily as a Special Inspector to supervise the Disinfectors, the Temporary Inspectors, the Tenement House Inspectors, and the District Inspectors, the Food and Workshops Inspectors not to be included in the arrangement. The Food Inspector for the North and East was made Special Inspector, the District Inspector for Ward 8 was made Food Inspector for the North and East, the Tenement House Inspector for West and South was made District Inspector for Ward 8, and one of the Temporary Inspectors was made Tenement House Inspector for West and South. During 1902 the four Temporary Inspectors were re-appointed from time to time. One was acting as Tenement House Inspector for the West and South Divisions, and the other three were engaged in carrying out duties for the mensuration and registration of tenement houses. Two of these appointments lapsed. On the 26th November, 1902 (p. 691), the Borough Council resolved to appoint permanently two of the Sanitary Inspectors appointed temporarily. During 1903 there were 8 District Inspectors, 1 for each Ward; 1 Special Inspector; 3 Tenement House Inspectors, 1 for the North, 1 for the South, and 1 for the East and West Divisions of the Borough; 2 Workshop Inspectors, 1 man for the workmen of the whole Borough, and 1 woman for the women of the whole Borough; and 2 Food Inspectors, 1 for the North and East Divisions, and 1 for the West and South Divisions of the Borough. On the 27th July, 1904 (p. 159) the Borough Council resolved to appoint temporarily an additional Woman Inspector. The Woman Inspector was re-appointed temporarily from time to time. On the 11th October, 1905 (p. 508), the Borough Council resolved to appoint the temporary Woman Inspector permanently. At the commencement of .1905, the number of Sanitary Inspectors was 17, and in accordance with resolutions of the Borough Council passed on the 2nd November, 1904 (p. 635), the Inspector of Workshops (men), and the 3 Inspectors of Tenement Houses were made District Inspectors, and the 67 inspection of workshops and factories where men are employed, and of registered tenement houses were added to the duties of District Inspectors. This alteration abolished the Man Inspector of Workshops, and the Tenement House Inspectors, and altered both the duties and areas of the District Inspectors. On the 7th March, 1906, (p. 319) the Borough Council resolved that the Special Inspector cease to inspect disinfected rooms, and that the District Inspectors undertake this duty. That the Special Inspector continue to superintend the Disinfecting Station, Contact Shelter, and Cleansing Station, and that he be given a District (the Town Hall District) formed of part of Wards 3 and 6 in which to carry out the duties of District Inspector and Food Inspector, and that it also be his duty to accompany other Inspectors where confirmation of a drain test is necessary. On the 17th July, 1907, (p. 80) the Borough Council resolved to relieve the Special Inspector of the supervision of the Disinfecting Station (presumably also of the Contact Shelter, and of the Cleansing Station) and created the senior Disinfector Foreman of the Disinfecting and Cleansing Station. On the 31st July, 1907, (p. 139) the Borough Council resolved to dismiss a District Inspector for neglect of duty, &c. On the 18th September, 1907, (p. 428) the Borough Council resolved not to appoint a Sanitary Inspector to fill the vacancy created. On the 18th December, 1907, (p. 965) the Special Inspector's District was extended to include the whole of the College and Oakley Square Sub-Divisions in which to carry out his duties as Food Inspector and District Inspector. Female Officers.—The appointment of Women in Public Health Departments is now so general that a classification becomes desirable, as follows:— A. Women Sanitary Inspectors. B. (Women) Health Visitors. I. Paid (Health Visitors). II. Unpaid. (а) Professional Voluntary Visitors. (b) Philanthropic Voluntary Visitors. Professional Voluntary Visitors are women professionally qualified either as Sanitary Inspectors, Midwives, or Nurses, or holding Certificates in Hygiene, etc., and intending to take up the calling professionally. Philanthropic Voluntary Nurses are women in independent circumstances who desire to employ part of their time in beneficial public work. Since the autumn of 1905 to the end of 1907 there have been some 21 women philanthropists intermittently working in St. Pancras for various periods, and 14 professional women working more regularly and for longer periods, about half of whom have since obtained public appointments. 68 § 2. OPEN SPACES AND ATMOSPHERE.

Smoke.—In the Animal Report for 1902 the enactments dealing with smoke were set out in full. There were 234 smoke shafts on the Register; 762 observations of these were taken, and 25 re-inspections were made after notices served. These observations or inspections and re-inspections occupy a considerable amount of time, as the intervals between stoking arc of considerable duration—at least twenty minutes, and often twice as long. The Inspectors are now instructed to limit their observation of a chimney to half- an-hour, and only to prolong it beyond this period so long as a nuisance is actually being committed. (See Minutes of Public Health Committee of 30th January, 1907.) Effluvia.—Of various businesses and places producing effluvia or offen-ive emanations there are 134 on the Registers, and of these 156 inspections and 27 re-inspections were made. (See also under the head of Nuisances § 9.1 § 3.—DWELLINGS. (a) House-to-House Inquiries and Inspections.—(i.) For the purpose of ascertaining the mode of sub-letting, 1787 inquiries and 156 re-visits were made as to the occupation of houses in teneirented streets, (ii.) When the mode of sub-letting appears to be sucli as to necessitate periodical supervision of the sanitary condition of a house a complete enquiry is made into the mode of occupation of each room of the house. (iii.) When it has been decided to register a tenement house each room is measured as to its dimensions and capacity and recorded in the Register. The forms in which the reports as to these matters are made, were quoted in the Annual Report for 1904. (b) Tenement Houses.—During the year, 74 inspections and 0 re-inspections were made for the purpose of measuring tenement or lodging houses which it had been decided to register, and at the end of the year 2316 houses were upon the Register. Of these houses, 2429 periodical half-yearly inspections were made, and 5315 re-inspections after the service of notices. Also of the 166 dwellings entered in the Register of Inscribed dwellings 93 inspections were made, and 89 re-inspections after the service of notices. The following is a record relating to registered tenement houses: — On Register at end of 1906 2309 Registered during 1907 10 Total 2319 Ceased to be registered housss in 1907 3 On Register at end of 1907 2316 72 BY-LAWS AS TO HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS OR TO MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. On the 26th June, 1907, after considering a Report of the Medical Officer of Health, dated 13th March, upon the By-laws for Houses Let in Lodgings, and upon the recommendation of the Public Health Committee the Borough Council resolved to revise the By-laws as requested by the Local Government Board in the following manner— (a) That clause 19 of the model by-laws of the Local Government Board, which is as follows, be added to the Council's by-laws on the subject, viz.:— "Where a duty imposed upon or a prohibition applied to "the landlord of a lodging house is by any by-law expressly "imposed or applied, subject to the provisions of these by-laws, "proceedings shall not be taken against the landlord for an "offence against the by-law unless and until the landlord, after "the service upon him of a notice in writing by the Council, "requiring him within such reasonable time as is specified in the "notice to comply with the by-law within the time so specified." (b) That amendments in definitions and other clauses substituting Metropolitan Borough for Parish, Metropolitan Borough Council for Vestry, Public Health Committee for Health Committee, and Public Health Department for Health Department, and any other consequential amendment (necessary, be made in the Council's by-laws. (c) That the following addition be made to the existing by-law 3 of the Council's by-laws:— Provided that in either of the following cases a tenement house shall be exempt from the operation of these by-laws; that is to say:— (1) Where the landlord resides upon the premises. (2) Where the number of separate dwellings in which the house is sub-let does not exceed one-third of the total number of habitable rooms in the house. Provided furthermore that no tenement house in which it may be found that an underground dwelling is illegally occupied shall be exempted from registration under these by-laws. (d) That the Council's by-laws on the subject, after amendment as recommended above, be submitted to the Local Government Board for approval. Further, with reference, to the removal of houses from the Register, (e) That upon application being made by the owner for the removal of a house from the Register, such house may be removed therefrom, provided the Public Health Committee arc satisfied as to its sanitary condition. 73 Upon receiving the amendments proposed by the Borough Council the Local Government Board suggested a Conference to discuss the proposed amendments. The Conference took place at the Board's Offices in Whitehall on the 27th September. After discussion it was agreed with regard to (c) — (e) That the following addition be made to the existing By-law 3 of the Council's By-laws:— "Provided that in either of the following cases a tenement house shall be exempt from the operation of these Bylaws ; that is to say:— "(1) Where the landlord resides upon the premises and the sub-letting is not to more than one tenant. "(2) Where the number of separate dwellings in which the house is sub-let does not exceed onethird of the total number of habitable rooms in the house and no such dwelling contains less than two habitable rooms." The paragraph dealing with the registration of tenement houses where an underground room was found to be illegally occupied was deleted, the inference being that such a house would not come within the exemption. With regard to the new by-laws (a) and (6) approved by the Council on the 26th June, 1907, these By-laws being derived from the Model By-laws, the Local Government Board further suggested that it was desirable that the Borough Council should adopt the entire draft Model By-laws of the Board, forwarded for consideration on the 20th July, 1907, and embody the foregoing additional By-law C, as amended, in substitution for the present Tenement House By-laws of the Council. This amended addition to By-law 3 as an exemption clause was adopted by the Borough Council on the 9th October, and sent to the Local Government Board for approval. On the 19th February, 1908, I reported to the Public Health Committee as follows:— I have enquired into the subject matter of the letter of the Local Government Board, dated 29th October, 1907 (119, 427 C 1907), enclosing copy of a letter of the County Council, dated 7th October, 1907, relative to the Exemption Clause proposed as one of the amendments of the By-laws with respect to Houses Let in Lodgings, together with a copy of a list of houses showing the effect of the Exemption Clause. The Exemption Clause as adopted by the Borough Council on the 9th October, 1907, is as follows:— Addition to By-law 3:— That, in substitution of the addition to the By-laws agreed to be made by the Council on the 26th June, 1907, the following 74 addition be made to the existing By-law 3 of the Council's By-laws: — "Provided that in either of the following cases a tenement house shall be exempt from the operation of these Bylaws ; that is to say :— "(1) Where the landlord resides upon the premises and the sub-letting is not to more that one tenant. "(2) Where the number of separate dwellings in which the house is sublet does not exceed onethird of the total number of habitable rooms in the house and no such dwelling contains less than two habitable rooms." The effect of Sub-Clause 2 is that if the number of dwellings exceeds onethird of the total number of rooms the house is not exempt; on the other hand if it equals or is less than one-third the house is exempt provided that no dwelling therein has less than two habitable rooms, otherwise the house is not exempt. Consequently, the house will become registerable, if containing 4 or 5 rooms it be subdivided into 2 or more dwellings, if containing 6 to 8 rooms it be subdivided into 3 or more, if 9 to 11 rooms into 4 or more, and if 12 to 14 rooms it be sub-divided into 5 or more dwellings. Houses of 6 or 8 rooms let in 2 dwellings, of 9 to 11 rooms let in 3, and of 12 to 14 let in 4 dwellings will be exempt provided none of the dwellings contain less than 2 rooms. Briefly put, the proviso in practice will exempt house3 let in dwellings of 3 or more rooms. In 3 or more rooms there is very little likelihood of overcrowding, as such a dwelling could accommodate quite a large family. In trying to frame a limitation it is desirable to have in mind the objects of the By-laws. They are mainly to prevent overcrowding of rooms and domestic and sanitary conveniences and to secure cleansing, and for these purposes, amongst others, to make periodical inspections. Experience shows that the more sublet a house becomes, and in proportion as the number of separata dwellings in an ordinary house increases, so the amount of inspection necessary to prevent overcrowding and secure cleansing also increases. Thus, generally speaking, a house sublet in one-room dwellings will be proportionately more liable to be overcrowded, and, on account of greater and more continuous use, become sooner and more unclean than a house sublet in tworoom dwellings, and so on with regard to three and four and more room dwellings. The model By-laws suggest a rental limit for houses to be exempted. Whatever may be the case elsewhere enquiry has elicited the fact that in St. Pancras the rental paid for a similar room in the same situation on the same floor, and occupied by the same number of persons, will be, in the southern part of the Borough, about double that paid in the northern part, so that the higher rental limit would exclude houses requiring registration, and the lower 75 rental limit would include houses not requiring registration. The fixing of a rental limit must necessarily act as an incentive to raise the rent of rooms in order to claim exemption from the By-laws. As the number of rooms in a separate dwelling or letting decreases, the rental per room increases, so that fixing a limit at the higher rental of a one-room dwelling must necessarily act as an incentive to increase the number of one-room dwellings and diminish the number of dwellings of more than one room in a house, Rooms on the topmost storey are usually let at the lowest rental and to the poorest tenants; if the lowest standard of the topmost storey be adopted nearly all tenement houses will be exempted, if the highest standard of the ground or first floor be adopted nearly all tenement houses will be registerable. It is obvious that a pecuniary standard presents many difficulties. The essential point that necessitates legislation is the degree of subdivision in subletting to which a house is subjected, and this degree is calculable from (1) the number of dwellings in the house, and (2) the number of rooms in each dwelling. But as a house is not usually sublet all in one-room dwellings, or all in two, three, four, or more room dwellings, an average can be struck and an exemption made where the number of separate dwellings in which the house is sublet does not exceed one-third or one-fourth of the total number of habitable rooms in the house. In the list accompanying the letter of the County Council, dated the 7th October, there are enumerated 69 houses in streets in Highgate New Town. Of these 69 houses it is stated that 48 would be exempt and 21 not exempt from the By-laws. When carefully examined, it is found that the numbers should be 39 exempt and 30 not exempt from the By-laws. When examined closely it is found that those exempt are certain houses in Lulot Street, Rectar Street, and Raydon Street, which are constructed with three rooms on a floor, and are let in floors as completely equipped with sanitary and domestic arrangements on each floor (for they have sculleries as well as three habitable rooms) as average flats of the same size. In order to include this class of dwellings it would be necessary to make the proviso read, "where the number of separate dwellings in which the house "is sublet does not exceed one-fourth of the total number of habitable rooms "in the house, and no such dwelling contains less than three habitable rooms." In fact, the question resolves itself into at what point of sub-division in letting the operation of the By-laws should begin. The St. Fancras Borough Council says that the sub-dividing line should be below the 3-room dwelling. The London County Council says that it should be above the 3-room dwelling If the London County Council object to the method of limitation rather than to the degree then the alternative is a limitation by rental, but this can be shown to have an infinitely greater effect in excluding a larger number of dwellings than the sub-division method of limitation. It is to be presumed that if St. Pancras were to adopt a rental limitation it would be similar to that of Islington where the exemption is for houses let in unfurnished rooms at the rate of not less than 4s. 6d. per week and such room is occupied by not more than two persons, and where the rent of two rooms or more is at the rate of not less than 7s. 6d. per week, the number of persons 70 limited presumably by the amount of cubic space available. The effect of this would be to exclude from registration a large number of rooms in South St. Pancras, where the rental of single rooms is from 4s to 6s., of two rooms 6s. 6d. to 8s. 6d., of three rooms 9s. 6d. to 11s., and these are the rentals quoted from the Report of the Board of Trade upon Working Class Rents, which has just been published, but there are a number of instances, especially in such streetsas Whitfield Street, Tottenham Street, and Windmill Street, where rentals of single rooms range from 6s. to 7s., and of two rooms from 10s. to 14s., and toadopt such rentals as a limitation of exemption would if applied to North St. Pancras include a class of houses the owners and occupiers of which would so resent registration that the By-laws would by popular opinion be reduced to little effect. It is unfortunate that Lulot, Retcar, and Raydon Streets should have been, chosen to demonstrate the effect of the proposed exemption, because the houses in these streets are practically all constructed in three rooms on a floor, and are therefore exceptional, and the streets are unlike those in other parts of the Borough. There is little likelihood of overcrowding in dwellings containing three rooms and a good sized scullery in addition, and if any of these floors are subdivided in letting the houses so subdivided become registerable. There is another reason why this choice of streets is an unfortunate illustration Highgate New Town is a jerry built town requiring constant attention and repair to keep it in reasonable sanitary condition, apart from overcrowding and cleansing. Recently Lulot Street has been inspected and the result of the inspection has necessitated the service of 25 Notices for the abatement of nuisances, 11 notices of remedying breaches of Statute and By-laws other than those for houses let in lodgings, and 16 Notices for non-compliance with the By-laws for houses let in lodgings; all sixteen referring to cleansing and none to overcrowding. It is true that cleansing and the abatement of overcrowding can be more easily enforced (because they are defined), under the By-laws for houses let in lodgings, than under the nuisance sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, where they are undefined. But as there are usually a number of other matters to be remedied in the houses of this Town under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, cleansing can be included amongst them. For the purpose of securing periodical inspection every six months, the entering of the houses in these streets in an Inscribed List for such periodical inspection will generally effect the purpose. The questions to be decided are— (1) Whether the Council will adhere to the exemption from registration—Where the number of separate dwellings in which the house is sub-let does not exceed one-third of the total number of habitable rooms in the house and no such dwelling contains less than two habitable rooms. (2) Whether the Council will limit the exemption by altering the words "one-third" to one-fourth, and the word "two" to three, and (3) Whether the Council will adopt a middle course by altering the words "one-third" to one-fourth, leaving the word "two" unaltered. 77 On the 8th April, 1908, the Public Health Committee reported to the Borough Council as follows:— Your Committee are of opinion that, while the Council should adhere to their resolution of the 9th October last, adopting the Exemption Clause in question, which has since been approved by the Local Government Board, the houses in Lulot, Retcar, and Raydon Streets, to which reference is made in the above report, should be subject to periodical inspection by the Sanitary Officers of this Authority. Your Committee recommend— (a) That the Council do adhere to their resolution of the 9th October, 1907, adopting the Exemption Clause in their By-laws relating to Houses Let in Lodgings, as set out above in the second paragraph of the foregoing report of the Medical Officer of Health. (b) That the houses in Lulot, Retcar, and Raydon Streets be entered on the Inscribed List for periodical inspection by this Authority's Sanitary Officers. (c) That a copy of the Medical Officer of Health's report as above, and the Council's decisions thereon, be forwarded to the Local Government Board and to the London County Council. These recommendations were approved and adopted by the Borough Council. Water Supply to Tenement Houses.—In Part VI. (Legislation) will be found set out lection 78 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, as to water supply in tenement houses. The section empowers the Sanitary Authority to require water to be supplied on the storey or one of the storeys in which the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of each family arc situate in a tenement house. Cooling Accommodation in Tenement Houses.—In the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908, Part III., clause 20, it is proposed to empower Sanitary Authorities to require sufficient and suitable accommodation for the cooking of food to be provided for each family occupying a tenement house. (c) Underground Dwellings.—At the end of the year there were on the Register 478 underground rooms which had been illegally occupied as dwellings, and had been ordered to be closed, and of which 38 inspections had been made, and 10 re-inspections after notices served. Time is allowed to the occupants of these rooms to find rooms elsewhere, and during the time allowed the illegally occupied rooms are kept under observation, and the number vacated or otherwise occupied ascertained and reported. The houses in which these dwellings are found are added to the register of registered tenement houses. (d) Common Lodging Houses.—There are 19 Registered Common Lodging Houses in St. Pancras, and these are supervised by the London County Council, including the one Salvation Army Shelter in South. St. Pancras. Rowton Houses are not so registered; of these there are in St. Pancras, one at the southern end of King's Cross Road in South St. Pancras, and another at the northern end of Arlington Road in West St. Pancras. 78 (e) Canal Boat Dwellings.— During the year 74 visits of inspection were paid to the 31 wharves on the Regent's Canal. (f) Working-Class Flats.— A list of the principal of these and the accommodation provided will be found in the Appendix to this Report. (g.) —HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS. Part I. Area No. 1.—Somers Town. 1(a).—Churchway Scheme.— In continuation of the previous Annual Reports on the subject of housing, this scheme was completed by the London County Council; the other schemes are moving as described here following. 1(b).—Part of area west of Charton Street and north of Drummond Street line.—The houses in this area were dealt with individually under the Public Health Act years ago. 1(c).—Part of area east of Chalton Street.—In continuation of the history of the Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place Schemes. The schemes of 1898, amended in 1901, relating to those two areas were embodied in one Order by the Local Government Board, and a notice thereof published in the "London Gazette." The Midland Railway Company having acquired the land in 1898, petitioned against the Order in December, 1905, as did also a leaseholder, and the Order of the Local Government Board sanctioning and embodying the schemes became "provisional." On the 17th February, 1906, the Directors of the Midland Railway Company, by letter, suggested that the Borough Council should endeavour to find another site for the erection of the new buildings for rehousing persons proposed to be disturbed under this scheme. The Local Government Board introduced a Bill into the House of Commons entitled "An Act to confirm a Provisional Order of the Local Government Board relating to the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras." This Act was passed on the 4th August, 1906. It is provided in the Act (section 1) that "the Order set out in the schedule hereto shall be and the same is hereby confirmed and all the provisions thereof shall have full validity and force as from a date to be fixed by an Order of the Local Government Board, not being less than twelve months from the passing of this Act." Areas Nos. 2 and 3. Prospect Terrace and Brantome Place Order.—In the Order the number of persons to be displaced from these two areas is 1,165, and the number to be rehoused on the three sites scheduled in the Order is 842 persons. The position with regard to the three sites is as follows:— (a) Great College, Street Site.— On this additional vacant site included in the Order of the Local Government Board for the purpose of housing part of the persons displaced from the Brantome Place and Prospect Terrace areas, Goldington Buildings were erected and opened in 1904, and are fully occupied. These buildings were described under the head of (f) Working Class Flats in the Annual Report for 1905, p. 108, and accommodate 332 persons, or 10 more than required on this site by the Order of the Local Government Board. 79 (b) Brantome Place Area.— In continuation of the course of events recorded in the Report for 1906, in March, 1907, tenders for the buildings designed by Messrs. Joseph and Smithem were advertised for. The tender of Mr. H. L. Holloway for £17,479 for the buildings and £760 for the lodge was accepted by the Borough Council, and also the tenders of Messrs. Lascelles & Co. for artificial stonework for £1,689, and of Messrs. Hawkins & Baxter for ironwork, &c., for £545. The contracts were signed in the beginning of July, and the work proceeded with. On the 7th November, 1907, the Mayor, Alderman Donald McGregor, j.p , laid the Foundation Stone in the presence of the Aldermen, Councillors, and visitors. The Dwellings are being erected with a frontage of about 368 feet to a new street called Brantome Place, in course of construction, between Mabledon Place and Burton Street, and containing a superficial area of about threefifths of an acre. At the rear of the buildings there will be a large open space of an average width of 50 feet, which will afford ample lighting and ventilation to the buildings, and at the same time can be used by the children of the tenants as a playground. The elevations, though of the simplest character, will be most attractive in appearance, as the long front will be divided up by large projecting bays, and the broken sky line will form a pleasing feature in the design. The buildings will be six storeys in height, including the half-basement and attic storeys, and will be faced with red Leicester bricks relieved with dressings of artificial stone of a pale buff tint. The half-basement will be made as attractive as the ground floor, as there will be a long slope planted with evergreens in front of the windows. The buildings will be of fireproof construction throughout, the floors being formed with steel and concrete, and the pavings and landings being finished with granolithic material. The walls of the staircases will be faced with white tiles, thus ensuring an absolutely smooth and clean surface, requiring no annual expenditure for painting or distempering. The floors of the w.c.'s will be laid with mosaic and the walls tiled in the same way as the staircases. The buildings will contain:—48 three-room tenements, and 36 two-room tenements, containing 216 rooms, and will house about 432 persons, based on an average of two persons to a room. All the tenements will be self-containcd, that is to say, each tenement will have a separate scullery and w.c., and every tenement will be entered from a lobby so as to give absolute privacy to the tenants. From this lobby access is obtained to the scullery and w.c., and thus completely cut off from the liv ing rooms. These lobbies will be provided with a shelf and hat and coat hooks. The scullery, which will be used as a kitchen, will be fitted up with a washing trough and an independent copper for washing clothes, a larder, 80 dresser, coal bunk, a small gas cooking range, and also an improved form of the double-faced range as suggested by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. By lifting up a shutter in the middle of this range the fire can be transferred into the living room, which adjoins the scullery, so that the tenants need only light one fire, which will serve for cooking and heating purposes. Every bedroom will be fitted up with a dress cupboard with shelves and pegs for hanging clothes thereon. The buildings will be lighted with incandescent gas. The Superintendent will be situated in a two-storey lodge adjoining the main buildings. The basement of this lodge will be utilised as a drying room to enable the tenants to dry their clothes. A small charge will be made for this. At the rear of the buildings there will be situated a large number of perambulator and bicycle sheds for the use of the tenants, for which a charge of Id. or 2d. per week will be made. The rents proposed to be charged will be:— 10s. per week for a three-room tenement. 7s. per week for a two-room tenement. The living rooms will have an average area of 160 feet. The bedrooms of the two-room tenements will have an average area of 129 feet. The two bedrooms of the three-room tenements will have an average area of 108 feet and 102 feet respectively. The total cost of the buildings, exclusive of the cost of the land, will amount to about £22,000, and the rents have been so adjusted as to make the undertaking self-supporting, involving no charge upon the rates. (c) Prospect Terrace Area.—This area was chared in 1906 as related in the Report for that year. The Borough Council decided to set aside the plan prepared in 1901 as being too expensive and unsatisfactory, on account of the washhouses, sculleries, sinks, and w.c.'s being used in common on each floor, and that it was undesirable to have dwellings of the associated type, and to substitute for them dwellings of the self-contained type. Accordingly, plans of this type of dwelling were prepared by Messrs. Joseph & Smithem. The proposals included the erection of 36 three-room tenements and 34 two-room tenements, and a caretaker'a lodge, comprising 12 baths, a drying room for the use of the tenants, and also 2 two-room tenements for letting. The scheme approved on 5th June, 1907 was to rehouse 352 persons as compared with 140 in the original scheme. The specification was considered and revised. The Architect's estimated cost of the buildings was £16,977, and the rents with the rates at 7s. 1d. in the £ was given by them as 3s. 4d. per room per week for the three-room tenements, and 3s. 6d. per week for the two-room tenements, and the number to be rehoused under the revised proposals 352. 81 HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890, PART II., SINGLE HOUSES.

In the case of individual houses efforts are made to exhaust the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to remedy defects, before resorting to the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, except when it is obvious that no remedy short of demolition and reconstruction is available. § 4-SCHOOLS. At the 42 grant receiving schools 24 inspections were made during the year by the Woman Inspector. The Board of Education decided to relieve Local Authorities from the obligation to provide school places for children under the age of five years, the age at which compulsory school attendance begins; and many Authorities are ceasing to admit school children from 3-5 years of age. On the 2nd October I made the following Report to the Highways, Sewers, and Public Works Committee, and as it is of some interest, I beg to quote it in extenso:— On the 27th ultimo I received a communication from the Chief Clerk informing me that the Works Committee are considering the advisability of laying out a portion of the St. Pancras Gardens to be used as a gymnasium 82 and sand pit for children, and that the Committee desired me to report upon the subject from a sanitary point of view on or before the next meeting of the View Sub-Connnittee on Monday afternoon the 7th October. I presume that the sandpit is intended for children who have passed the suckling age, and have not yet reached the compulsory school age, that is from 1 to 5 years of age, and that the gymnasium is intended for children of school age say from 5 to 15 years. With regard to gymnasium for children of school age, in my opinion every school child should have access to a gymnasium, and if a gymnasium is not provided in the school attended by the child, it should be provided elsewhere. Gymnastic exercises are essential to the health of day-school children. With regard to a sand pit for children before school age unless some person is appointed to continuously supervise the use of a sand pit so as to exclude children suffering from suspicious throats, noses and eyes, coughs, colds, and blights, in a neglected, dirty, or verminous condition, or otherwise undesirable, and to see that the sand is regularly cleansed or changed, the sand pit may do more harm than good. The provision of a supervisor is of much more importance than the mere provision of a pit with sand in it, and the question of success or failure does not lie in the construction or appliance but in the management. § 5.—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. Factories.—The Men Inspectors had 356 and the Woman Inspector 108 factories upon the Registers for periodical inspection as to water service, sanitary conveniences, drainage, and nuisances. During the year 94 and 47 inspections of factories, respectively, were made, and 35 re-inspections after notices served. Workshops.—The Men Inspectors had 673 (apart from bakehouses) and the Woman Inspector 385 workshops (apart from laundries) on the Registers for periodical inspection. During the year 822 and 154 inspections, respectively, of these premises were made, and 244 and 6 re-inspections after notices. Workplaces.—These include restaurant kitchens, cab and omnibus yards, laundries and domestic workshops, and home workplaces. Domestic Workshops and Home Workplaces.—The Woman Inspector has 69 of these on the Register, of which 247 inspections and 1 re-inspection after notice were made. These places vary in number from year to year, and according to the season of the year. Laundries.—On the Register are 74 laundries at which the Woman Inspector made 76 inspections and 1 re-inspection. Restaurant Kitchens.—Of these the Men Inspectors had 107 and the Woman Inspector 158 on the Registers. At the former 158 inspections and 91 re-inspections were made, and at the latter 11 inspections and 2 re-inspections. Bakehouses.—At the commencement of the year there were 173 workshopbakehouses. Of these and of the three factory bakehouses, and the three bakehouses in hotels, 322 inspections and 166 re-inspections were made. 83 Tabular Statement.— The following is a tabular statement of the work of the Men Inspectors in the form desired by the factory Department of the Home Office :— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.

They refer to women only, with the exception of about 120 men working in their own homes. During the year enquiries into the following questions have been made: — The employment of married women in factories and workshops of the district. The living accommodation available for working women. The cleansing of schools. The voluntarily notified cases of consumption, with special reference to industrial conditions affecting the disease. A separate report on consumption appears in that section of your Report dealing with the question. Throughout the year I have given much attention to the connection of the Children's Baths and the Schools. The Baths have done excellent and much appreciated work for the children of the Borough. Every effort is made that the treatment may be as effectual, as educational, and as kindly as possible, and there can be no doubt that much permanent good is done. The improvement effected could be more readily maintained if some system of facilitating access to the ordinary Baths, after the children have been thoroughly cleansed, could be devised; and, with the co-operation of the Children's Care Committees, this ought to be possible. An arrangement of this kind, by preventing the relapse into dirty conditions, which is frequently a result of lack of bathing accommodation in the child's home, would reduce the number of recurring cases requiring treatment at the Cleansing Baths. Registers have been kept for the different classes of premises inspected. Notices and notifications have been sent out as required. I append the statistical statement desired by the Home Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, M. E. Bibby, Sanitary Inspector of Workshops (Women). 86 Woman Inspector's Work ONLY. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, LAUNDRIES, WORKPLACES, AND HOMEWOK. 1.—Inspection.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. †The figures required in columns 2, 3, and 4 are the total number of lists (received from employers who sent them both in February and August as required by the Act) and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. They will therefore, usually be double of the number of such employers and (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. 88 3b.—Home Work.

If the Annual Report is presented otherwise than in print, it is unnecessary to include in the copy sent to the Home Office the portions which do not relate to factories, workshops, laundries, workplaces, or homework. The duties of Local Authorities and the Medical Officer of Health under the Act of 1901 are detailed in the Home Office Memorandum of December, 1904.

The Factory and Workshop Act of 1901, S. 149. applies the Act to any premises in which any manual labour is exercised by way of trade, or for purposes of gain in or incidental to any of the following purposes, namely:— (1) The making of any article or part of any article. (2) The altering, repairing, ornamenting or finishing of any article, or (3) The adapting for sale of any article. These provisions have lately not been applied to Florists' establishments, for one of the stipendary magistrates decided that as flowers were a natural and not a manufactured article, they did not come under the Act; this decision has now been appealed against*, and it has been definitely laid down by the High Court that the preparing of a natural article for sale is included in the definitions of the Factory Acts. • Hoare v.

Number of Notices, as to houses from which water has been cut off:— 1.—Demolition 38 2.—Empty 32 3.—Leakage 22 4.—Non-payment of Rates 4 5.—No statement 4 100 A communication was received dated the 20th July, 1907, from the Clerk of the Metropolitan Water Board saying that the Board would be obliged by the co-operation of the Officers of the Borough Council in directing the attention of the Board to infringements of the Regulations made under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, to the mutual advantage of the Public Health of the Borough and of the Board, and enclosing a copy of the Regulations. For the guidance of the Council and of the Officers the Statutory Provisions, the Regulations, and the By-laws concerning Water Supply and Water service are set out below. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891.

On the 17th April, 1907, the Borough Council resolved to convene a Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils with a view to obtaining legislation to protect Metropolitan Sanitary Authorities from being burdened with the cost of the maintenance of combined drains. The Conference was held at the St. Pancras Town Ilall on the 24th June, and a Committee was then appointed to prepare a Petition or Draft Bill dealing with the law relating to combined drainage. A second meeting of the Conference was held on the 6tb December, 1907, to receive the Report of the Committee which was in the forin of Clauses for a Draft Bill. The Bill in its draft form as drawn by the Committee and which is now hefore Parliament, introduced by Mr. W. H. Dickinson, m.p. for North St. Pancras, is as follows:— 98 [8 Edw. 7.] METROPOLITAN SEWERS AND DRAINS. A Btli, to amend the Metropolis Management Acts with respect to Sewers and Drains. Be it enacted by tbe King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:— 1. In and for the purposes of the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 to 1899, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or any Act or Acts amending the same, the word "drain" shall be deemed to include any sewer or drain, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act, with which two or more houses, buildings, or premises are, at the date of the parsing of this Act, or may at any time thereafter be connected or which is used or capable of being or intended to be used for the conveyance of the drainage of such houses, buildings, or premises directly or indirectly to any sewer which has been approved as such by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, the Metropolitan Board of Works, or the London County Council, but shall not include any sewer so approved as aforesaid. 2. This Act may be cited as the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1908, and shall be construed as one with the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same. The history of Combined Drainage in St. Pancras will be found set out in a Report of the Chief Clerk of the Public Health Department in the Borough Council's Minutes of the 18th September, 1907 (pp. 414-422), and the subsequent proceedings to date will be found in the Report of the Chairman of the Public Health Committee for 1907-8. § 8.—STORAGE AND REMOVAL OF OFFENSIVE MATTERS. CLEANSING AND SCAVENGING. The Removal or Reuse and Stable Refuse.—The life history of flies is being diligently traced by several observers during the warm weather, and as far as observations go up to the present the indication is that in order to prevent the breeding of flies it is necessary to remove stable refuse and soiled litter twice a week, and the same would appear to apply to some forms of house refuse. In any case the storage of domestic refuse in closely-packed houses and especially tenements and flats, except for short intervals, is always regarded as prejudicial to health in'addition to being conducive to the breeding of flies. § 9.—NUISANCES, NOTICES, &c. Regent's Canal Wafer.—Specimens of water, taken from various parts of the Regent's Canal within the Borough, were sent for analysis to Sir Thomas Stevenson. The general tenor of his reports upon these specimens of water was that the water was sewage polluted, but that the contamination was not such as to cause a nuisance. 99 Offensive Businesses.—Revised by-laws framed by the London County Council for regulating the conduct of offensive businesses were approved by the Local Government Board in November last and came into force forthwith. § 10—SUMMONSES. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (except in respect of Food). Situation of Property. Offence.

V.-FOOD. § 1 —FOOD PREMISES. The dairies, cowsheds, and milkshops, the slaughterhouses, the places where raw foods are prepared, and the marketing places have been regularly visited and inspected. The markets and marketing streets have also been regularly visited on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. Bakehouses, restaurant kitchens, and similar workplaces fall under the Factory and Workshop Acts, and have been dealt with under Part IV. The London County Council (General Poirers) Bill, 1908.—Part III. (Sanitary Provisions) of this Bill proposes to give power to Sanitary Authorities to remove from or refuse to enter on the Register the names of dairymen whose 100 premises are unsuitable for the sale of milk, also the power to Sanitary Authorities to require the surrender of offensive trade refuse and unsound food. It also proposes certain definite Sanitary regulations for premises used for the sale, etc., of food for human consumption. It also empowers the London County Council to make by-laws with regard to certain buisnesses, namely, fish-frying, fishcuring, and rag and bone dealing. Diseased Cattle.—In September a communication was received from the Local Government Board suggesting that the Sanitary Officers should be instructed to watch closely cattle markets, slaughterhouses, and knackers' yards, and in this connection the movement of cattle is of importance, coupled with the list of slaughterhouses at the end of this Report in appendix B. Metropolitan Cattle Market Ritchie—Mayor. Notice is hereby given that the Regulations hereunder set out have been made by the Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis.

Nursery Milk.—In October I reported to the Public Health Committee as follows:— On the 25th July, 1906, the Borough Council approved the recommendation of the Public Health Committee that during the hot weather 30 samples of milk intended for hand-fed infants of suckling age be examined bacteriologically. On the 12th September and the 12th December I furnished reports to your Committee as to the result of the sampling and examination of nursery milk, which reports were presented to the Council on the 19th December, 1906, and they were also quoted in my Annual Report for the year 1906. On the 21st November, 1906, the Borouga Council, upon the recommendation of your Committee, confirmed the previous recommendation and resolved that the taking of 30 samples of milk during the hot weather for bacteriological examination be continued. Accordingly, during the warm weather of this summer the same procedure was adopted in taking the samples as was described in my report of the 12th September, 1906. The results of the sampling and examinations arc contained in a tabulated form in the appendices attached hereto. These tables show (a) the price and source of the samples of nursery milk purchased, (b) the results of the bacteriological examination of the samples, (c) the results of the chemical examination, and (d) the results of further sampling and analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of the unsatisfactory samples in table c. Among the 30 samples first taken, and numbered consecutively 1 to 30 in the tables, two numbered 17 (a 47) and 18 (a 48) were found to be tuberculous, and repeat samples were taken of these, numbered respectively 31 (a 55) and 32 (a 56), in which tubercle bacilli were not found microscopically, but the result of inoculation into guinea pigs showed at the end of eight weeks that in the case of 31 (a 55) the spleen was histologically tuberculous in structure although no tubercle bacilli (acidfast) were found, and that in the case of 32 (a 56) the spleen presented numerous small tubercles on the surface and a few tubercle bacilli were detected in preparations of the spleen and other glands. The slaughtered cows showed, in the case of 31 (a 55), corresponding to 17 (a 47), lesions only in the udder of small extent, and in the case of 32 (a 56), corresponding to 18 (a 48), lesions in the udder and several of the glands throughout the carcass. I reported upon these tuberculous milks to your Public Health Committee of July 24th last in a report of the same date which was presented to the Borough Council on July 31st, together with the following recommendations of your Public Health Committee which were approved by the Council. (a) That the action taken by the Medical Officer of Health in the matter be approved. (b That a copy of the report of the Medical Officer of Health be sent to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, and the London County Council, with a representation stating that this 104 Council are strongly of opinion that power should be given to Borough Councils, under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1889, article 2, and of 1885, article 15, to remove and place in temporary quarantine any milch cow suspected to be diseased or tubercular, until the animal is released or condemned by the Veterinary Inspector, under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts, and to pay reasonable compensation to the owner for such quarantine or detention. (c) That a copy of the foregoing report of the Medical Officer of Health, and of the communication to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, and the London County Council on the subject, be sent to each of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, asking them to support the representations made by this Council in the matter. Your Committee instructed me to have samples of milk drawn from all the cows in the cowshed in which the two tuberculous cows were discovered, and the ten samples numbered consecutively from 33 to 42 inclusive represent the samples so drawn. It will be observed that in 8 of the 10 famples the deposit consisted entirely of pus cells, in one of a considerable number of pus cells, and that only one of the samples was free from pus cells. The inference to be drawn from this is that the cows were habitually stripped to such a degree as to produce chronic irritation of the mammary canals and the production of pus. The stripping of cows, that is, the drawing of the very last drop of milk from the udder by pulling on the teats until no more can be drawn, is habitually practiced in order to stimulate the mammary glands to se jrete the maximum amount of milk. This amount can also be increased by milking the cow more often, say three times instead of twice in 24 hours, and also by feeding the cow on more liquid or more liquid food. '1 here is also an impression that feeding the cows on mangolds and brewers' grains (cheaper forms of food than those usually given) tonds to increase the quantity of milk, overlooking the fact that they render the milk injurious to suckling infants and sick persons A lady recently returned from Belgium told me that she was astonisheu at the enormous quantity of milk produced by a herd of cows near where she was staying until she found out that the cows were excessively stripped, milked three times in the twenty-four hours, and fed upon semi-liqui 1 mashes instead of solid food. The dairy-farmer was vastly proud of his success. It is obvious that unless there is control over the management of cows, especially the feeding and milking, in the production of nursery milk, the control over the buildings and the management of subsequent processes during and after the drawing of milk, are of little avail in obtaining a milk of fit quality for sick persons and suckling infants. In this respect " nursery milk" would be better termed nursing milk, in so much as it is intended to be used as the standard food for the maintenance of life in those who are sick and suckling, and therefore require nursing, and is of infinitely more importance than ordinary commercial milk, which is mainly consumed by the healthy, who have many other foods at their disposal, and upon whom the quality and purity of the milk has little or no effect unless extremely bad or infected with specific disease. 105 In milk shops it appears that nursing milk is rarely asked for across the counter ; it is practically always ordered and consumed by the better class of customers. The poor have not learnt that there is or should be any difference between nursery milk and ordinary commercial milk, and so they rarely ask for or buy the former. It follows that the samples of nursery milk purchased and reported upon in this report are specimens of the very best milk supplied in St. Pancras, and it is obvious how much these leave to be desired in the matter of cleanliness and wholesomeness, and even some of these milks have their chemical and bacteriological composition altered either in the feeding of the cow or the handling of the milk. I have come to the conclusion once more that the only satisfactory way of preventing milk which I should call "nursing milk" for the sick and suckling — that is, hand-fed infants and the bed-ridden sick, neither of whom can take any other than milk diet,—is to have a special herd of cows in a special dairy where " commercial" milk is not purveyed, the dairy being situated close to the locality which it supplies, so that it may be under constant control and very frequent supervision, be conducted on the latest up-to-date principles, and deliver the milk for consumption immediately after milking. The Bacteriological Examinations were made by Mr. John Eyre, M.D., and the Chemical Examinations by Sir Thomas Stevenson, M.D. 106 APPENDIX A. NURSERY MILKS. The Price and Source of the Specimens.

Inspector Auger was instructed to repeat these two samples, which were drawn direct from two cows in the same stall in the same cowshed. Upon these two samples Dr. Eyre wrote that one of them (A 48, repeat 56) contained what appeared most probably to be tubercle bacilli, and that the other (A 47, repeat 55) was also suspicious, and that both of them contained large quantities of pus; in fact, in both the first and second samples of A 48 the tilth consisted entirely of pus cells, and in the first sample of A 47 the filth consisted entirely of pus cells and in the seeond of a very large number of pus cells. I had a personal interview with Dr. Eyre, and we came to the conclusion that, apart from the question of tubercle, the danger of supplying so large a quantity of pus cells in nursery milk was so great that its supply should be prohibited. With regard to tubercle, Dr. Eyre requested to be allowed to inoculate the milk in order to be perfectly sure that the acid fast bacilli which he had found in the milks drawn direct from the cow were tubercle bacilli. To this course I assented, and at the same time I asked him to furnish me at once with the certificates of the results of his examinations. In the meantime I proceeded to Messrs. Ricketts, the Council's Solicitors, in order to ascertain the course that should be adopted by the Officers of the Borough Council, and they advised that when the disease was finally found to be tuberculosis of the udder, the consent of the owner should be obtained to the slaughter of the cows, the rest of Mr. Ricketts' letter referring to the method of procedure that it might be possible to adopt under certain circumstances in prosecuting. I was convinced that the cowkeeper was not aware of the condition of things, and I felt that it was imperative that the milk should be stopped from distribution forthwith. In perusing the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order of 1899,1 found that Article 2 includes, in the case of a cow, such disease of the udder as shall be certified by a veterinary surgeon to be tubercular, and that Article 15 of the Order of 1885 provides that if at any time such disease exists amongst the cattle in a cowshed, the milk of a diseased cow therein shall not be mixed with other milk and shall not be sold or used for human food. With the consent of the Chairman of your Committee, I therefore forthwith called upon Prof. MacQueen, of the Royal Veterinary College, and, accompanied by Inspector Auger, we proceeded to the cowshed and Prof. MacQueen examined the cows. He was definitely of opinion that the cow A 48, repeat 56, was affected in the udder, but he was doubtful with regard to the cow A 47, repeat 55, but that as both milks contained a large quantity of pus they were unfit for human consumption. I therefore asked the owner of the cows, in accordance with the Articles of the Orders above-mentioned, not to mix the milk with other milk and not to sell or use the milk for human food. It was then that I realised how impracticable it was to carry out the Orders in this respect. It was not practicable to leave an Inspector in the shed night and day to see that the milk of these cows was not mixed with other milk, and was not sold or used for human food. There was no provision for removing and quarantining the cows, and if the milk were seized oil each 116 occasion of drawing, it would be necessary to have it examined fo prove that it was unsound and unfit for food, which was equally impracticable. The only effective course would be to remove and detain the cows and compensate the owner, for it was not obvious to the eye that the cows were suffering from any disease, and the owner was in no way to blame; 011 the contrary he offered every facility, and was only too anxious that anything wrong should be put right. As the Officers of the Borough Council had exhausted their powers, I communicated with the Inspector under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, Mr. W. G. Barnes, F.R.C.V.S. He promptly came to the Town Hall, and, accompanied by Inspector Auger, we proceeded to the cowshed. He examined the cows and pronounced one decidedly tubercular and the other most probably so. He took possession of the cows and informed the owner that he should assess the compensation, and that someone would come down to fetch them away. Afterwards Mr. Barnes kindly called at the office and told me that the cows had been taken away to the Cattle Market, and I supplied him with all the information I could that might assist him. Milk Supply (Tuberculosis).—As set out in Part VI. (Legislation) of this Report the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, Part IV , empowers the Officers of the County Council to take samples of milk within the County, and under a Magistrate's order outside the County. It also empowers Officers of the County Council to inspect cows, and take samples of milk in cowsheds within the County, and under Magistrate's order outside the County, and empowers the County Council to make an order to prohibit the supply within the County of any milk from any specified cow or dairy. London County Council's Legislative Proposals for 1908 in reference to Milk Suppli,. — The St. Pancras Public Health Committee considered the communication from the London County Council, dated the 24th July, 1907, submitting legislative proposals of their Public Health Committee for securing a pure and wholesome milk supply for London, and asking for the views of this Authority on the subject. The London County Council on the 9th July last resolved—" That in the " opinion of the Council general legislation affecting the whole country and " more effective administration are necessary for the purpose of securing a " purer and more wholesome supply of milk; that representations to that " effect be made to the President of the Local Government Board, and that it " be referred to the Public Health and Parliamentary Committees to give " effect to this proposal; and that it be referred to the Public Health Com" mittee to report in detail as to any legislation which they may consider " necessary for the purpose of securing a pure and wholesome milk supply for " London in particular, pending or in addition to general legislation, after " conferring with or otherwise ascertaining the views of the Metropolitan " Borough Councils and the City of London." The County Council's Public Health Committee in their report on the subject state that they feel that powers for taking samples of milk arriving at railway stations in London and elsewhere would be economically and efficiently administered in conjunction with that proposed with regard to tuberculous milk. 117 Your Committee are of opinion— That if it is desirable to legislate for the purpose of securing a purer and more wholesome supply of milk in England in general and more desirable to legislate for London in particular, it is then most desirable to legislate for the Boroughs in particular with a view to a better administration of local self-government, and to enable local authorities to protect their own ratepayers and traders. That if it is desirable to economically and efficiently administer powers for taking samples of milk for the purpose of bacteriological analysis, the greatest economy and efficiency will be obtained by conferring these powers 011 the Borough Councils, inasmuch as their Inspectors who take samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts for chemical examination could most economically and efficiently also take samples at the same time for bacteriological examination. That it is not possible, economically and efficiently, to separate the administration for taking samples for bacteriological analysis from that of taking samples for chemical analysis of the same article of food, and, if the proposals of the County Council are insisted upon, it will mean a large number of Inspectors being engaged by them to do exactly similar work to that done by the Borough Council's Inspectors of food, and will become unnecessarily irritating to dealers and other traders. That greater economy and efficiency lies in the method of proceeding from the consumer to the producer than the reverse way is shown by the fact that the Borough Council's Inspectors, when complaint has been made or suspicions aroused with regard to milk, sample the retail vendor, and if the retail vendor expresses innocence and states the source of his milk supply, the milk of the dealer supplying the retailer is next in turn sampled in transit at the retail vendor's premises. If the wholesale dealer also expresses innocence, and divulges the source of his supply, which may be the farmer who is actually the producer, then the milk again is sampled in transit at the railway station where received from the farmer. By this means of sampling consecutively, step by step, from the consumer back to the producer, it is possible to fix more closely the responsibility, both for the genuineness and for the wholesomeness, of the milk supplied to the inhabitants of the Borough. Your Committee would also point out that the proposal of the London County Council to commence by taking samples at railway stations and to trace the milk through the various retailers to the consumer is a wrong and costly method of procedure, inasmuch as it has been proved that at the railway stations both in St. Pancras and Islington on more than one occasion by taking samples promiscuously that over 98 per cent, of the milk sent to London by farmers is certified as genuine, and that as under 2 per cent, is found adulterated, the expenditure, time, and energy of discovering this two per cent, by the methods suggested by the County Council will be out of proportion to the results obtained. Your Committee are of opinion that any attempt which should be made by the County Council or any other body to deprive the Borough Council of such 118 powers as may be necessary to economically and efficiently protect both the consumers and traders in the Borough should be opposed as contrary to public welfare. Your Committee express this opinion strongly because the Public Health Committee of the London County Council think fit to express their view that it is obviously undesirable that the Borough Councils should even have concurrent powers with the County Council. The question at issue is not that of visiting farmers in the country, but that of excluding impure and unwholesome milk from the Boroughs and from the l ountry, and your Committee think that it would be more desirable to compel the Borough Councils to forthwith notify to the County Council whenever they exclude impure milk, and that the County Council should be empowered to take action in regard to the whole of London when two or more Boroughs make such notification, and take such proceedings, in or out of London, as may be necessary. The views expressed by St. Pancras in regard to the proposals of the County Council's Public Health Committee in reference to the milk supply were communicated to the London Count}' Council. The clauses of the London Count}' Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908, referring to milk were withdrawn, the President of the Local Government Board having intimated that he proposed to bring in a comprehensive Bill to deal with the milk supply of the whole country. TUBERCULOUS, PURULENT, AND DIRTY MILK, AND OTHER UNWHOLESOME FOODS. For a long time past it has been felt that the powers of local authorities are inadequate to prevent the production and distribution of those unwholesome foods which do not reveal their unfitness for human consumption to the sight or smell of an inspector or medical officer, and of a magistrate, and which consequently cannot be seized under the Public Health Acts, especially tuberculous, purulent, and otherwise unwholesome milk. These foods can be ascertained to be unfit for human consumption by processes employed in bacteriological analysis, but there is 110 general legal procedure provided by which samples of such foods can be procured for this purpose. If such foods could be brought within the compass of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts this powerlessness of local authorities might be overcome. By Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act of 1875, it is provided that "no person shall sell to the prejudice of the purchaser any article of food or any drug which is not of the nature, substance, and quality of the article demanded by such purchaser," if after these words the following words added " or, in the case of food, any food which is diseased, unsound, or unwholesome, or unfit for the food of man," such food would then be brought within the Acts. Bv Section 10 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act of 1875, the City of London, the Metropolitan Boroughs, the County Councils, the County Boroughs, and the Quarter Session Boroughs, must appoint one or more persons possessing competent knowledge, skill, and experience, as analysts of all articles of food and drugs sold within the City, County or Borough, and by Section 3 (5) of the Act of 1899 any further analyst appointed must furnish such proof of competency as may from time to time be required by regulation framed by the Local Government Board. 119 By the regulation as to competency framed by the Local Government Board dated 7th March, 1900, it is provided that every person appointed on or after the first day of January, 1900, to the office of Public Analyst, shall furnish such proof as we may deem sufficient of his competent skill in and knowledge of (a) analytical chemistry (b) therapeutics, and (c) microscopy. Tf this Regulation of the Board were so amended as to read " the office of Public Analyst shall furnish such proof as we may deem sufficient of his competent skill in and knowledge of—in the case of a chemical analyst (a) analytical chemistry (b) therapeutics, and (c) microscopy; and in the case of a bacterialogical analyst (a) analytical bacteriology (b) physiology, and (c) pathology "; then bacteriological as well as chemical analysis would be brought within the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Some of the larger cities have obtained, and others are obtaining, powers for examining such unwholesome foods, and excluding them from distribution and consumption within their areas. The extension of such powers to urban and rural districts by the suggested amendment of the Food and Drugs Acts would enable the smaller authorities not only to better control the milk and meat distributed in their districts, but also to assist and advise dairy farmers and others in improving the wholesomeness of the milk and meat produced within their respective areas.

Unfortunately the second sample is not a sample of the inculpated milk, but it may in some measure be evidence of the bona or male fides of the guarantor. WARRANTIES. It is generally admitted that a considerable proportion of the dairy farmers of this country produce milk which is often found wanting in cleanliness and freedom from tuberculous and other objectionable organisms, and from excess of acidity, but which also is rarely found wanting in a proper proportion of fats and solids other than fats ; in other words, the dairy farmer is rarely fraudulent, though he may be often regarded as ignorant or even negligent. On the other hand, the milk distributed in London is often found wanting in a proper proportion of fats and of solids other than fats, and in the prosecutions that follow the discovery of these adulterations it has become the custom for milk-dealers to plead warranties. This is the procedure: the defendant milk-dealer swears that he sold the milk as he received it, and brings all his staff to confirm this on oath, and 124 produces a label which he or a member of his staff swears was attached to the churn in which the milk came from the dairy farmer, and as this label bears the words "Pure whole milk," or a similar expression, it is regarded by the Courts as a warranty, and the warranty is regarded as proved by those who have sworn to the above statements and have not been contradicted. It can be proved to be the custom of milk-dealers to dispatch directly from railway depots part of the milk for distribution without first taking it to their dairies, and to make use of the milk platforms of railway depots as places for the handling of milk. This "handling" consists of mixing the milks of various churns for the purpose of altering the quantities in the churns to regulate the amount of milk in each churn to be distributed direct or to be taken to the premises of the milk-dealer to whom the milk was consigned by the dairy farmer. The Courts will not accept any evidence of this custom, but require proof of mixing in the case of the particular churn in question before the Court. It can also be proved that the labels or warranties are often removed from the churns on the railway platform, and that the man sent to "handle" milk will put a number of them indiscriminately into his pocket. It is astonishing how confidently the man will swear in the witness-box that a particular warranty label came off a particular churn from a particular dairy farmer. It is impossible without an enormous staff of Inspectors continuously on duty night and day at the milk platforms of the railway companies to watch the adventures of each individual churn in a railway depot. The defence of warranty by a milk-dealer nearly always succeeds; the dairy farmer cannot be prosecuted in regard to the same sample, and has no opportunity of proving his innocence, and therefore the dairy farmer's reputation is being damaged, and is continuing to be more and more damaged the more frequently warranties are set up and established. MILK BELOW THE STANDARD OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. A Sanitary Inspector of Islington took a sample of milk at the premises of Mr. G., and the Public Analyst for Islington certified the sample as adulterated; but no prosecution took place because the deficiency was not considered large enough to lead to conviction. Mr. G., after his milk had been sampled by the Sanitary Inspector of Islington, applied to St. Pancras to have a sample taken of each of four churns delivered at King's Cross Station, Great Northern Railway, on the 14th February, consigned to Mr. G. by Mr. D., a dairy farmer of Staffordshire. The samples were taken and the Public Analyst certified as follows:— C. 44. Genuine. 3.16 Fat, 8.54 Solids. C. 45. The deficiency of milk fat corresponds to the abstraction of 9 percent, of the milk fat. C. 46. The deficiency in milk fat corresponds to the abstraction of 8 percent, of the milk fat. C. 47. Genuine. 3.00 Fat, 8.62 Solids. The Public Health Committee decided to prosecute in the case of the samples C. 45 and C. 46. 125 A letter was received on the 18th February, 1908, from the Secretary of a Farmers' Association that he had tested Mr. D.'s milk taken at the farm, and found it below par, that the cows were giving poor milk, and some days afterwards he advised Mr. D. to alter the feeding to see if that would bring the quality up to standard. On the 9th March the Secretary wrote again, saying that Mr. D. was giving an abnormal ration of concentrated food, with the result that the morning's milk was just over the standard. He pleaded that the Dairy Farmer was innocent of any fraudulent action or intent, and asked for the summons to be withdrawn. The two summonses were heard at the same time at Clerkenwell Police Court on the 25th March. The summonses were for the deficiency of 9 per cent, of milk fat in one case, and of 8 per cent, in the other, and it was explained by the Solicitor that of the two other samples taken of the same consignor's milk, one was found to contain 3 per cent, of fat and the other 3.16 percent, of fat. It was also explained that each of these samples was taken from separate churns on the same day, which must have represented the produce of a large number of cows. Witnesses came forward to swear that the milk was sent to London as it was drawn from the cow. Of course it is impossible to bring controverting evidence in such cases, and the Magistrate dismissed the cases. This case raises some important questions It does not matter so far as the consumer is concerned whether the farmer acted ignorantly or fraudulently. It appears that by altering the feeding, the milk of a certain cow was altered in composition, and it is known that according to the strain and breed cows can be chosen for yielding large quantities of poor milk instead of small quantities of milk of a high standard, so that by economising on the price of the herd and on the quantity and quality of food, either an ignorant or a frudulent dairy farmer can produce milk that is persistently below standard (and the Board of Agriculture's standard itself is low), and can produce witnesses to swear that this is the genuine article. The fundamental point, therefore, that has to be decided is whether the law should require that all milk produced shall be above a given standard, as it is evident that the Sale of Milk Regulations of the Board of Agriculture, dated 5th August, 1901, were useless to control the quality of milk consigned by a dairy farmer in bulk in this case, which was tantamount to an appeal to a herd of cows. THE APPEAL TO THE COW. Ertract from the Annual Report of the. Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, for the Year 1906. p. 59.' "Reference was made in the issue of the Journal for May, 1907 (p. 89), to the importance of testing at certain specified intervals or at certain points in the lactation period for the purpose of ascertaining the average percentage of fat contained in the milk of individual cows, while for the purpose of checking the proportion of butter-fat in the mixed milk of a herd, it is obvious that testing at frequent intervals must be necessary. It is hoped that as the value of the system becomes more recognised, regular and systematic testing will be more generallv adopted, and will take the place of the occasional and sporadic 126 sampling which has been a feature of many districts. A number of reports refer, in fact, to the growing tendency among farmers to send in samples at periodic intervals, and state that the facilities afforded are much appreciated. One analyst observes that the samples are generally sent in by large, wellto-do farmers, but otherwise there is not much to show how far the scheme has been taken advantage of by small cowkeepers. In a number of cases the tests have shown the sample, whether taken from the milk of a single cow or from the mixed milk of a herd, to be below the 3 per cent, limit, or deficient in respect of the solids not fat, provided by the Sale of Milk Regulations. In these cases the information afforded by the analysis should be of great value to the cowkeeper. In the case of the milk from one cow which falls substantially below 3 per cent limit, the first step should be to ascertain whether this sample can be regarded as typical. For this purpose several samples of her morning and evening milk should be taken at intervals and submitted for analysis. If the cow is well fed and in good health, and the results are unsatisfactory, it is desirable that she should be removed from the herd, and her place taken by a cow yielding milk with a higher percentage of fat. In the case of mixed milk of a herd falling below the prescribed limits, the question of the hours of milking should be considered, and a serious effort must be made to milk at hours which will allow a nearly equal interval between each milking. If this is done the mixed milk is very unlikely to fall below the 3 percent, limit. If, however, a change in this respect is impossible, an attempt must be made to improve the herd by eliminating poor cows, and introducing either better animals of the same breed or else Jerseys or Guernseys which can be relied upon to give a high proportion of butter-fat Generally speaking, if the animals are sufficiently fed, no alteration in the food is likely to have any permanent effect. It should be recollected the cows have a tendency to give the lowest proportion of butter-fat in the third month after calving." In another place (p. 8) the Report says :—"It is reported from one district that a milk vendor keeps a cow which gives milk of very low quality, and in the event of a sample of the milk from this dairy being found on analysis to fall below the limit referred to in the Sale of Milk Regulations, reference is always made to this cow." PRESERVATIVES IN FOOD. The present position appears to be that a prosecution cannot be brought successfully in regard to a preserved food unless it" can be proved that the amount of preservative consumed at a meal of the adulterated food is sufficient to produce a measurable ill result. Evidence is not admissible as to the large and increasing number of foods to which chemical preservatives are added, nor as to the probability or possibility of several of such adulterated foods being eaten at a meal, or at a number of consecutive meals, or habitually. 127 Summonses.—Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report on my work in the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Borough for the year ended December 31st, 1907, as inspector of Food and Food-places. Markets.— I made 1908 inspections of the various market places, including butchers', porkbutchers', poulterers', fishmongers', and greengrocers' shops, and stalls, and the following articles have been destroyed, being diseased or unsound and unfit for food. 1 pig's carcass. 2 crates of pears. 14 tubs of strawberries. 3 tubs of raspberries. 6½ cwt. of skate. 2 cwts. of herrings. 1 cwt. of haddocks. 24 boxes of tomatoes. Bullocks' and sheeps' lungs and livers. Food Makers.—I made 405 visits to the premises where sausages, ice cream, tripe, &c., are made, and with few exceptions, found the premises satisfactory and the food sound. Licensed Slaughterhouses.— There are now only 6 private slaughterhouses in my district, one having been removed owing to the licensee not making the usual application for the renewal, preferring to do this instead of having the application opposed by this Authority for an infringement of the By-laws. I made 232 inspections, during which I saw 703 sheep, 96 bullocks, 126 pigs, 47 lambs, and 10 calves, killed and dressed, and such organs as on examination were found to be diseased I had removed, by the written request of the owners, under Sub-section 8 of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Licensed Cow-sheds.—I paid 55 visits to the licensed cow-sheds (3) and on a few occasions I had to call the owner's attention to the By-laws. Milkshops.— I made 517 inspections of milkshops and with few exceptions found the milk vessels generally satisfactory. During these visits I found 34 persons selling milk without being registered in accordance with the Dairies, Cow-sheds, and Milkshops Orders. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.— I obtained 325 samples of articles of food and drugs for analysis by the Public Analyst under these Acts, of which 63 were adulterated. Bacteriological Examination.— I took 14 samples of "Nursery" milk for examination, also 2 samples direct from the cow into sterilized bottles ; for results please see Dr. Eyre's report. During the year I attended before the Magistrates at the Police Courts 82 times in the discharge of my duties. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, Harry R. Child. 129 To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my report for 1907. FOOD INSPECTION. I made 528 visits to the market streets during the year, and procured 100 samples of food under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts; 79 visits were made to premises where food was exposed for sale, or in course of preparation for sale. The milkshops and dairies were visited quarterly ; slaughter houses and ice cream places weekly, and cowsheds fortnightly. The following food was destroyed at the Dust Destructor as being unfit for human consumption. cwt. coal fish 1¾ cwt. skate. 10 stones of dates. 1 trunk fresh haddocks. 3 tubs of raspberries. Bacteriological Examination of Milk.— I took 16 samples of milk for bacteriological examination, the samples being taken in sterilized bottles and packed in ice; where procured at a cowshed they' were drawn direct from the cow into the bottle, when purchased at a shop "nursery milk" was asked for. Periodical Inspections.— I made the usual inspections of Bakehouses, Tenement Houses, Workshops, Factories, &c., and served notices where necessary. I am, Yours obediently, W. G. Auger. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my report for the year ended 31st December, 1907. Markets.— The market streets, costers' barrows, stalls, fish-shops, and curing premises were inspected daily; 2047 inspections were made, and the following articles of food were destroyed as unfit for human food :— 1 carcass of beef (126 stones). 1 cwt. mussels. 200 oysters. 4 rabbits. 12 lbs. of fruit Food Makers.— I made 496 inspections of premises where food-stuffs are made, such as polonies, sausages, pies, etc., and found the meat and other ingredients used sound and wholesome, and the premises generally clean. Slaughter-houses.— There are 12 slaughter-houses in my division which I inspected 283 times and found them kept in accordance with the regulations of the London County Council. I examined a large number of animals slaughtered, and found them free from disease and generally of first-class quality. 130 Cowsheds.— There are five licensed cowsheds registered to keep 102 cows; 113 inspections were made, and the premises found in a cleanly condition generally, and the London County Council by-laws observed. There has not been any disease among the animals. Milkshops.— I made 406 inspections of the registered milkshops and dairies and found the utensils and premises generally' kept in a fairly clean condition. The small general shops selling milk are not so clean as the larger dairy shops which deal only in dairy produce. Food and Drugs Acts.— I submitted 340 samples of food to the Public Analyst for analysis, and four samples of water from the Regent's Canal (for results see report of Sir Thomas Stevenson, Public Analyst). Bacteriological examination.— I submitted 17 samples of milk for examination (for results see Dr. Eyre's reports). Legal Proceedings.— I attended the Police Court 28 times in connection with my duties as prosecuting Food Inspector. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, J. Osborne. Meat and Food Inspector. CANAL BOATS ACT. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, During the year I inspected 57 dwelling boats ; there were no infringements of the Act. There has not been any infectious disease or other illness on any of the boats inspected, and the regulations have been fairly well observed by the boat dwellers. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, J. Osborne. Canal Boats Inspector. VI.— LEGISLATION. § 1— GENERAL ACTS. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907 [7 Edw. 7, ch. 53.] This Act is divided into parts as follows:— (I.) General: (II.)

All persons who have anything to do with glandered or farcied animals should bear in mind the following facts:— The disease can be communicated to man by discharge from the nostrils, or other parts of a diseased animal of carcase. The disease in man is almost always fatal. It is specially dangerous for any person with scratches or sores on the hands or face to handle diseased horses or carcases. By care and strict attention to cleanliness the danger of inoculation is. avoidable. § 6.—LEGAL DECISIONS. SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE. Court of Appeal. 24th, 25th, 30th October, 1st November, 1905. Parker v. Talbot. Common lodging-house—What is—No payment by those housed—Common Lodging-Houses Act, 1851 (14 & 15 Vict. c. 28) —Common LodgingHouses Act, 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c. 41)—London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902 (2 Edw. 7 c. 173), Part IX. Common LodgingHouses Act (Ireland), 1860 (23 Yict. c. 26), ss. 2 and 3. 146 The definition of the term "common lodging-house" in the Common Lodging-Houses Act (Ireland), 1860, as a house in which persons are lodged for hire, applies to the Common Lodging-Houses Act, 1851 and 1853. The fact that the Act of 1860 has been repealed makes no difference in this respect. A house carried on as a charitable institution to which destitute persons of the very poorest class are admitted, and treated and dealt with in a manner similar to the frequenters of common lodging-houses is not a common lodging-house within the Common Lodging-Houses Acts, 1851 and 1853, and the London County Council (General Powers), Act, 1902, Part IX., if no payment of any kind is made by or on behalf of the persons admitted. Gilbert v. Jones (1905), 2 K. B., 691; 69 J. P., 392, overruled. Note.—Common Lodjing-Houses Act (Ireland), 1860 (23 Vict. ch. 26), sections 2 and 3. Section 2.—"This Act and 'The Common Lodging Houses Act, 1851,' and "The Common Lodging-Houses Act, 1853/ shall, for the purpose of the execution thereof in Ireland, be construed as if they were one Act, and the said Acts, as hereby amended, shall be deemed to extend to Ireland." Section 3. — "For the purpose of the execution of the said recited Acts, and of this Act in Ireland, certain words and expressions used in the said Acts are hereby declared and explained to have been intended to bear the following meanings, that is to say: — "The term 'common lodging-house' shall mean a house in which persons are harboured or lodged for hire for a single night, or for less than a week at a time, or any part of which is let for any term less than a week."

Finsbury Borough Council. Metropolis-Public Health- Houses drained by a eombined operationOrder of Vestry-Reception of public drainage into drain-Sewer-NuisanceIntimation notice threatening proceedings-Compliance under protest-Work done voluntarily or under compulsion-Right to recover expenses from local authority-Damages-Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (54 & 55 Vict, c. 76), ss. 3, 4-Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855 (18 & 19 Vict. c. 126), .s. 250. A group of premises drained by a combined operation discharged their drainage through a common pipe or conduit into a public sewer. The said pipe being defective and causing a nuisance, the borough council served " intimation notices" on the several occupiers of the said 147 premises (among whom were the plaintiffs), requiring them to repair the pipe and abate the nuisance, and threatening proceedings if the said notice should not be complied with. The plaintiffs denied liability alleging that the said pipe was a public sewer repairable by the borough council, but did the necessary work under protest. It was found that the said pipe in fact received certain public drainage as well as the drainage of the said group of premises. In an action by the plaintiffs to recover the cost of the work done and damages for injury to their premises caused by the defective condition of the said pipe. Held (1) that the said pipe was a sewer and repairable by the borough council; (2) that although service of an intimation notice does not by itself amount to compulsion, where work is done in compliance with such a notice under protest, or without admitting liability, such work is done under compulsion and not voluntarily, and the expenses of doing such work can be recovered from the local authority which was in fact liable to do it.

Held in Caxton Hall, Westminster, on 24th and 25th March, 1908. Resolutiont. A.—BIRTHS. That this Conference expresses its appreciation of Parliament having passed the Notification of Births Act, 1907, and urges upon all local authorities the importance of adopting the Act and appointing qualified women to carry out its provisions. B.—MOTHERS. No resolution. C.-INFANTS. That the Conference welcomes most gladly the Children's Bill introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. Herbert Samuel, M.P., for the amendment of the Infant Life Protection Act, 1897, and recommends the Executive Committee to ask that the Bill be specially amended to include the case in which one child only is put out to nurse for reward; and that the Bill be further amended to empower local authorities to charge upon the rates the cost of carrying out the existing statutory provisions for the prevention of cruelty to children. That the Conference being convinced of the injury done to infant life and health through infants being taken into public-houses, urges upon Parliament the necessity of providing such legislation as will prevent this. 149 That this Conference urges upon boards of guardians the advisability of making greater use of their existing powers to adopt under the Poor Law Act, 1899, the children of incorrigible parents. D-MILK. That in view of the unsatisfactory conditions under which milk is produced and distributed, the Conference, being of opinion that immediate amendment of the law is desirable, urges upon Parliament the necessity of at once taking such steps as are necessary to effect this. That all preparations offered or sold as foods or drugs for infants should be certified by a Government analyst as non-injurious, and that each packet should contain its analysis. E.-SCHOOLS. That in order to combat the prevalent ignorance resulting in wastage of infant life and injury to the health of many survivors, the Conference urges upon the Board of Education and upon educational authorities generally the importance of securing to all girls in every grade of school a satisfactory training in domestic and personal hygiene and the duties of womanhood. F.-MIDWIVES. That the Conference reaffirm the resolution of the former Conference that the Midwives Act, 1902, be extended to Scotland and Ireland. EXECUTIVE. That the Conference continue as a Committee to give effect to the foregoing Resolutions, with power to remit to an Executive Committee to carry out the same. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, JOHN F. J. SYKES, Medical Officer of Health. 150 VIII-APPENDIX (A) STATISTICAL TABLES. Table 1. ST. PANCRAS SANITARY DISTRICT.
