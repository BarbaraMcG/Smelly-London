MARYLEBONE FOR THE YEAR 1906. METEOROLOGY. March Quarter. January of 1906 was a wet month; there were 19 rainy days, giving a total fall of 3.35 inches. Frosts were seldom. The lowest recorded temperature was 27.5 deg., the highest 52.2 deg., and the mean 427 deg. The prevailing winds were westerly. February was cooler than January, the mean temperature being 39.9 deg., and the lowest and highest 29.2 deg. and 50.1 deg. respectively. The winds were also mainly westerly. There were 12 rainy days, the total rainfall measuring 168 inches. March was a cold month, particularly the last fortnight, when the winds set in the north-east. On 14 days rain fell, to the total amount of 0.88 inch. The minimum temperature was 28.o deg., the maximum 65.0 deg., and the mean 43.2 deg. Considering the weather of the three months as a whole, its chief characteristics were the persistence of westerly winds, with the consequent mild temperature and the absence of fog and snow. The June Quarter. April began with easterly winds and three rainless sunny weeks. The remaining two weeks were more unsettled, and showers yielded 0.54 inch of rain. The mean temperature of the month was high—50.8 deg., the extremes being 30.0 deg, and 71.5 deg. 8 May was also a fine month, the mean temperature being 513 deg. the minimum and maximum 360 deg. and 75.5 deg. respectively. There were only seven rainy days and a rainfall of 0.7S inch. The winds were north-east and south-west. June was a month of summer. The minimum temperature was40.0 deg., the maximum 8o.o deg., with a mean of 61.7 deg. There were only five rainy days, but the rain storms were exceptionally heavy, and the total rainfall for the month was equal to 3.28 inches. The weather of the three months was, therefore, particularly favourable. The temperatures were agreeable and the sunshine abundant. The September Quarter. July was warm, the mean temperature being 66.1 deg., the extremes 43.0 deg. and 85.o deg. The winds were south-east and south-west. Rain fell on seven days, the total rainfall being 1.13 inch. August was tropical in weather. The mean temperature was 69.0 deg., the extremes 50.0 deg. and 92.0 deg. On five days rain fell, the rainfall equalling only 0.28 inch. The winds were variable. The first week of September was the hottest of the year, the temperature attaining 94.0 deg. The remainder of the month was, however, more normal, and the mean temperature was 61.7 deg. There were seven rainy days; the rainfall measured 1.0 inch. The weather of the three months was, on the whole, therefore, dry, sunny, and warm. December Quarter. October was a wet, warm month. On no less than 17 days rain fell, the total rainfall being 3.19 inches. The mean temperature was 68.8 deg., the extremes being 35.5 deg. and 70.0 deg. November was also a month of heavy rainfall, 4.49 inches falling in 14 days. The winds were north-east and south-west. The mean temperature was 47.1 deg., the minimum 30.0 deg., the maximum 6o.o deg. The first three weeks of December were mild. Then followed a week of frost and snow. The lowest temperature was 20.0 deg., the highest 55.0 deg., and the mean 36.9 deg. There were 10 rainy days and three snowy days; the total fall was equal to 1.66 inch of rain. The winds were mostly north-west. The three months were, therefore, as a whole, with the exception of about 10 wintry days, mild and wet. 9 BIRTHS AND DEATHS. During the fifty-two weeks ending December 29th, 1906, there were registered 2,648 births and 1,931 deaths. The distribution and manner of the deaths are tabulated in Tables VI. and VII.—759 of the deaths took place in a number of extra-parochial institutions, as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 468 North-Western Fever Hospital 17 Western Fever Hospital 10 St. Mary's Hospital 57 Children's Hospital, Paddington 18 Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street 10 University College 16 King's College Hospital 2 Guy's Hospital 2 Charing Cross Hospital 5 St. George's Hospital 6 Royal Free Hospital 1 Westminster Hospital 5 German Hospital 5 French Hospital 2 Italian Hospital 1 Great Northern Hospital 1 London Hospital 1 West London Hospital 5 London Temperance Hospital 2 New Hospital for Women 2 Banstead Asylum 4 Hoxton Asylum 6 Darenth Asylum 3 Hanwell Asylum 17 Tooting Bee 2 Cane Hill Asylum 4 Claybury Asylum 4 Camberwell Asylum 2 Bethlem Hospital 2 Colney Hatch Asylum 10 Leavesden Asylum 5 City of London 2 Peckham House Asylum 1 Evelina Hospital 1 Grosvenor Hospital (Vincent Square) X St. Peter's Home, Pembridge Square 2 St. Anne's House, Stoke Newington ..

The average notifications of scarlet fever during the ten years previous to 1896 was equal to 392, the extremes were 789 cases in 1896 and 269 cases in 1898. During the past year the number was 387, a number well below the average. The curve opposite, page 20, traces week by week the distribution of these 387 cases and clearly shows that, speaking generally, the seasonal variations followed precedent, with an irregular slight burst in August, and an excess above the average in the first week of October. The case fatality was singularly low, viz., 3.7 per cent, of those attacked. 12 DIPHTHERIA. The number of cases of diphtheria from a ten years average, which might have been expected, was 213, but only 133 were notified. Of these 12 died, which equals a case mortality of 9 per cent. Diphtheria is always two or three times more dangerous than scarlet fever. The curve opposite, page 20 shows that the seasonal distribution presented nothing unusual and that the disease was constantly below the average. TYPHOID OR ENTERIC FEVER. There were only 45 cases of typhoid fever, two of which were fatal. In all these cases the cause of the malady, so far as could be ascertained, was due to influences without the Borough. Not a few of the cases, indeed, came into the district from elsewhere within the incubation period. PHTHISIS. For the first time in the sanitary history of the Borough an organised attempt is being made in the direction of exercising some control over the spread of phthisis. Early in July the Council, oil the recommendation of the Public Health Committee, resolved to pay the usual notification fee to medical men who voluntarily notified cases of phthisis coming under their observation. The result of this action has been that instead of some two or three practitioners intermittently notifying cases of phthisis, the majority of medical men practising within the district regularly transmit the information. During the six months 260 cases have been notified; although the 260 represent the number for six months actually received, it really nearly coincides with the probable number for the year, half of the cases being the accumulation of the previous six months. The six months' experience shows that the cases notified will average about 300 a year; there may be 300 other cases that are not so notified—that is 600 in all. Even if this guess, for it is only a guess, is correct, the case mortality is very high, for there have been 254 deaths from various forms of tubercular disease during the year, which 011 that assumption, would give a case mortality of 43 per cent. By far the majority of cases were those of adults of both sexes, and in most the malady produced much poverty and distress. The St. Marylebone Health Society, which was formed during the year, has done really good work in practical assisting these cases, by means of its Health Visitors and its connection with various agencies and charitable organisations. 13 In every case where disinfection has been advisable or necessary this has been done free of charge by the local authority. When the malady is purely local and of short standing it appears to be amenable to good hygienic conditions, and especially to the influence of sunlight and abundance of fresh air night and day. On the other hand, when the disease is generalised it is almost uniformly fatal, hence the importance of very early diagnosis and treatment. CLERICAL WORK OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. The clerical work of the Public Health Department has been most efficiently performed by Mr. H. E. Curtis, the Chief Clerk, and Messrs. W. J. Howe and A. H. James. The correspondence, as usual, has been heavy, as the fact that over 7,000 letters were received sufficiently shows. The following tabular statement summarises, as far as practicable, the clerical labours of the Department:— 1906. 1905 Number of Letters received and registered 7,184 Number of Notifications of Infectious Disease, entered in Register, copied and sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board and Schools, receipt acknowledged and filed 822 - 700 Number of Notifications of Phthisis, entered in Register, receipt acknowledged and filed (from 7th July, 1906) 317 Number of Complaints of Nuisances received, acknowledged, entered in Nuisance Register with Reports thereon and filed 1,428 1,282 Number of Letters despatched from the Department 4,041 3,723 Number of Council Orders issued 162 181 Plans Registered and approved by Public Health Committee 371 419 Plans indexed and filed 540 347 Number of Cowkeepers, Dairymen, and Purveyors of Milk Registered 253 343 THE SHELTER AND CLEANSING BATHS. 1 he shelter has only been used some half-dozen times during the past year. This is the usual experience of nonepidemic years. However comfortable a temporary home is made, persons displaced for the time by disinfecting operations 14 The following is a detailed statement of the occupation :— 1906.

The baths have been in full operation and had to be increased in number in the early part of the year. It reflects no small credit on the management that with only 11 baths (three for men, three for women, and five for children) so much cleansing has been effected. Should the proposed compulsory cleansing of filthy persons become law, the appliances at Grove Road will be in this Borough available. The report of the Matron, Miss Kilgallin, gives details as to the shelter and baths as follows:— 27, Grove Road, N.W., January, 1907 To the Medical Officer of Health. SIR, I beg to submit the following report of works for the year ending 1906:— The Shelter. The shelter was used 16 days during the year ending 31st December, 1906, accommodating for various periods 15 Adults and 6 Children. 15 Special Baths for School Children. From January 1st to December 20th, 1906, Boys 1,873, Girls 3,811, Totals 5,184. The New Baths were opened on the 31st of May. I am enabled to have the work more promptly done, having now 3 baths for men, 3 for women, 5 for children. The attendants under my charge, 1 have found most satisfactory in every way. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, Lillie Kilgallin, Matron. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS AND NUISANCES FROM SMOKE, etc. The following reports deal with the special duties allotted to two inspectors. The reports speak for themselves and give a connected summary of work done under the Factory and Workshop Acts, the abatement of smoke, and the general management of the Public Conveniences:— MR. RICHARD PHILLIPS' REPORT. January, 1907. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit the following report of work for the year ending 1906:— Factories and Workshops. There are in the Borough 171 registered workshops which are occupied exclusively by men. The principal trades engaged in are tailoring and outfitting. These workshops have been regularly inspected, and, where necessary, cleansing has been done and insanitary conditions remedied; and all new workrooms have been cubed up and registered in accordance with the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. Bakehouses. There are at present 82 Bakehouses in use; of this number eight are on the ground level and 74 are underground. During the year one Bakehouse underground has been demolished and one Bakehouse on ground level has been turned into use as a laundry. Smoke Nuisances The number of smoke nuisances detected or complained of during the year is 22. All complaints received have been dili- 16 gently investigated and reports made to the Public Health Committee. Intimation Notices have been served, and where the nuisance continued Statutory Notices have followed. Trade Nuisances. Complaints of four trade nuisances have been received, and in every instance they have been abated. Underground Conveniences. I have supervised the work of the Attendants at the four Men's Underground Conveniences at Oxford Circus, Marylebone Road, Portland Road, and Foley Street, and inspected the premises day and night, both on Sundays and all Bank Holidays. All necessary repairs, alterations and painting have been done. I have always found that the Conveniences were clean and well kept, and I am able to report with satisfaction on the work done by the Attendants. Public Urinals. The 22 Public Urinals have been constantly inspected at all times, and I have found them clean and well flushed. All repairs and painting needed have been attended to. The Shelter, and Large Disinfector. I have frequently inspected these premises and supervised any repairs that were needed. Hotels, Coffee Shops, Restaurants and Dining Rooms Of these I have made inspections of 220 premises, special attention being given to the kitchens and all places where food is stored. Appended is a statement of such work as admits of tabulation:— Workshop 634 visits made Bakehouses 401 „ Hotels, Restaurants, etc. 424 „ Smoke complaints 297 „ Home workers'premises 241 ,, Domestic workrooms 113 „ Underground conveniences. Public urinals Daily. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, Richard Phillips, Senior Inspector. 17 MISS BAKER'S REPORT. The Medical Officer of Health. January, 1907. Sir, I beg to present the following report of work for the year 1906:— Factory and Workshop Act. The workrooms of the district have been found to be generally in a very satisfactory condition; where necessary, cleansing has been done, and the ventilation and the means of heating the rooms improved. Number of workrooms on register at end of year 1905 2,404 „ „ „ „ „ „ 1906 2,521 „ businesses represented 2,144 Additional workrooms of the year 1906 332 Removals during the yeay 115 Number of re-inspections 296 The conditions under which outworkers follow their occupations are, as a rule, good; there appears always to be a certain class satisfied with questionable cleanliness amongst outworkers, these persons are generally of foreign extraction. Number of outworkers on register at end of year 1905 804 ,, removals during the year 31 „ added to register 218 Making a total at the end of the year 1906 991 Owing to the increased amount of personal supervision given by the Nurse appointed by the London County Council for the inspection of school children, no returns have been received under the Cleansing of Persons Act. Up to July, 1906,357 cases of births, attended by registered Midwives in connection with Queen Charlotte's and Middlesex Hospitals, were personally visited. With comparatively few exceptions these infants have been breast-fed, and on second visit were generally found to be healthy children. Out of this number 12 deaths have been traced, 5 of them being from premature birth, 3 from debility at birth, 3 from bronchitis, and 1 from summer diarrhcea. This scarcely gives a correct return of infant life in the district, as the cases visited do not include all of the poorest class where the mother has a neighbour without a qualified nurse, and where the need for advice may be greater. The Underground Conveniences. The Women's Conveniences have been inspected at all times; the Attendants' duties have been well performed. Any needed repairs and alterations have been done. I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, Frances A. Baker, Inspector. 18 MISS LIMONT'S REPORT. The report of Miss Limont relates only to a period of about five months. To Miss Limont has been allotted special duties such as the supervision of cases of phthisis and matters relating to infant sickness and mortality. January, 1907. To the Medical Officer oj Health. SIR, I beg to present a report of my work from July 23rd to December 31st, 1906. Voluntary Notification of Phthisis. I have investigated 243 cases, advised as to precautions to prevent spread of infection, and urged removal to a sanatorium or hospital where this appeared desirable. By means of re-visits I have tried to learn of the removal, recovery or death of the sufferer, with a view to disinfection of the home. Seventy-eight premises have been disinfected by this Authority, in three cases only was permission to do so refused. Elementary Schools. All such schools in the Borough have been inspected, and found to be kept in a cleanly state. Day Nurseries. The following nurseries—St. Paul's, East Street, Portland Town, St. Mark's, Violet Hill, and Ogle Mews, have been regularly visited; they are all exceptionally well managed, clean and well ventilated. Births Attended by Registered Midwives. Lists of such births are received weekly, and mother and child at once visited. Of the 304 infants visited only one has died, and this death was due to a diseased condition at time of birth. Re-visits are made as nearly as possible every three months, and if the child is ailing much more frequently. The mothers show a real anxiety to follow the advice given to them, and the standard of health among these infants is exceedingly good. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Sarah W. Limont, Inspector. 19 DISINFECTION. Disinfection of premises shows a decided increase in number over the previous year; this does not indicate the greater prevalence of infectious maladies but is due to the extension of disinfecting operations to cases of phthtisis. In a good many instances, also, rooms have been disinfected after measles.

NUISANCES. No less than 1,428 complaints ot nuisances were received and dealt with by the Inspectorial staff. The majority of these complaints were remedied at once by the person legally liable to abate the same, on his attention being called to the matter by letter. In 162 cases the proper Statutory Notice had to be issued. In the following cases the Notices had to be enforced by legal proceedings:— Owner. Nuisance.

HOUSE DRAINAGE. A considerable number of new premises, many of which are of a most important character, have been constructed during the year. The plans with regard to the drainage of these buildings have been duly considered and approved by the Public Health Committee, and the laying of the drains supervised by Messrs Gorniot & Perry. Mr. Gorniot taking the district south of the Marylebone Road, Mr. Perry the district north of the Marylebone Road. In all 371 plans of new drainage, representing 46,000 feet of pipes have been dealt with. In the following cases it has been considered necessary to proceed against builders for contravention of the law which compels them to give notice of proposed new drainage and to deposit plans and specifications. Mr. G. Pannett, of Tottenham Court Road, was summoned for doing work in Cleveland Street without giving notice, such work not being in accordance with the by-laws. The Magistrate fined the defendant £1, with 2s. costs. Messrs. H. & E. Lea, of Warwick Street, were summoned for not depositing plans with reference to a house in Oxford Street, and fined £2, with £3 3s. costs. Mr. Benjamin, of Mortimer Street, was summoned for not giving notice, and for executing sanitary work in Mortimer Street, not in compliance with the by-laws and fined £2, with 12s. 6d. costs for each offence. CURVE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF CASES NOTIFIED WEEK BY WEEK OF SCARLET FEVER. DIPHTHERIA. AND TYPHOID FEVER DURING 1906. 21 Mr. J. w. west, of Harley Mews, North, was summoned for a similar offence with regard to two houses in Harley Mews, North, and fined £2 and 8s. costs. A good many instances of combined drainage came during the year before the Public Health Committee. It is the general opinion of those conversant with the subject that some alteration of the law is necessary so as more clearly and more sensibly to define the terms "sewer" and "drain." The writer's own opinion is that the best alteration would be to throw upon the Local Authority the burden of constructing and maintaining all connections to sewers underneath the public roads, while all pipes or drains within the curtilage should be considered private drains. At present the owner of a private drain has to maintain and construct such drain from its higher end to the sewer. The portion under the road he cannot meddle with without the sanction of the Authority. In this district he cannot even construct that portion himself, but it is done at his expense by the Local Authority. Should, from causes over which he has no control, such portion get into a bad state, he has to pay for its reconstruction and repair. The principle seems to be sound that pipes under roads and streets should be owned by the Local Authority and not by private individuals; under such a system the maintenance of the sewers would in the long run be less, and problems of so-called "combined drainage" would be easy of solution. REPORT OF THE MORTUARY KEEPER. The Report of the Mortuary Keeper shows that an increased use of Mortuary was made during the year, as compared with 1905. In all cases of death in houses which have no proper accommodation for the storing of a corpse the Sanitary Inspector suggests, and where necessary compels, the removal of the body to the Mortuary. 22 REPORT OF MORTUARY KEEPER FOR THE YEAR 1906.

Six-hundred and thirty-one samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts have been analysed during the year. As usual the greater proportion of the articles analysed consisted of dairy produce. The systematic sampling of milk vendors in the district has been continued, special attention being given to those who have either been convicted or arc suspected of manipulating their wares. In 1905 it was found that of the samples of milk purchased for analysis about 16% were adulterated, in 1906 the percentage of adulteration comes out at 10.3%. So many circumstances affect these figures that it would be unwise to draw the conclusion that adulteration is decreasing. One thing is however certain, that although a large proportion of the London milk is coloured with a minute quantity of Methyl-orange, Boron and most other preservatives are now rarely met with. These preservatives have been conscientiously sought for in all samples of milk during the summer and the last quarter of the year, with almost negative result. In the list of samples detailed in Table II. will be observed 96 samples of canned goods, these were derived from various sources; the majority were, however, from the United States, particularly samples of tinned meats from Chicago. A special report as to the results of the investigation was made to the Public Health Committee, and it may be stated generally that the bulk of the samples submitted were perfectly fit for food, had evidently been made in a cleanly manner, and from healthy material; the use of Boron preservatives was general and not confined to the canned goods from the States. A few of the canned meats were distinctly unfit for food, and made from dirty material—probably enough the sweepings of the factory. To utilise all parts of the pig "save its squeal" may be smart business practice, but it will not suit the English market. The consequences of the close scrutiny which canned goods have been submitted to must have seriously affected the industry. Recently an attempt was made by the Inspectors to buy other samples, but a common reply was that the vendors had so little sale for such things that they had ceased to stock tinned meats. It is also to be noted that the new consignments of the same firms which had formerly sent out inferior goods, are apparently now free from Boron preservatives, and also free from the filth found as already mentioned in a few of the samples. A preservative not common in English sauces is Benzoic Acid: this was found in certain samples of American ketchup. The vendor was in possession of a warranty that the sauces were free from preservatives and was therefore ignorant of the addition. 24 PROSECUTIONS UNDER THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS—1906. Name.

These births and deaths are divided among the sub-districts as set forth in Table IV. Sixty-two of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 39 North-Western Fever Hospital 3 St. Mary's Hospital 2 Children's Hospital, Paddington 3 „ „ Gt. Ormond Street 1 University College Hospital 1 Royal Free Hospital 1 Great Northern Hospital 1 St. George's Hospital 1 Camberwell Asylum 1 Colney Hatch Asylum 1 Leavesden Asylum 1 Hanwell Asylum 1 Clapham Maternity 1 West London Hospital 2 St. Luke's House, Pembridge Square 1 In the Streets 2 Total 6 2 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the five weeks' statistics are as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 16.4; death-rate 7.2. St. Mary, birth-rate 16.9: death-rate 164. Christ Church, birth-rate 27 6; death-rate 14.7. St. John, birth-rate 24 9; death-rate 16.8. The whole district, birth-rate 21.2; death-rate 13.5. The average death-rates for ten years (1895 to 1905) for the corresponding period were as follows:—All Souls, 16.1; St. Mary, 21.7; Christ Church, 38.1; St. John, 29.4: the whole district, 20.3. The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes of disease and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes. 3 TABLE I. SHOWING THE COMPARATIVE MORTALITY DURING THE FIVE WEEKS ENDING FEB. 7th, 1906 FROM CERTAIN CLASSES OF DISEASE AND PROPORTION TO 1,000 DEATHS FROM ALL CAUSES:— Total Deaths. 5 weeks ending Feb. 7th, 1906.

Includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Influenza, Whooping Cough Erysipelas, Croup, Fever, and Diarrhœa. 3. Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. 4 Health of the District. The death rate is lower than it has been for 10 years, the reason being the freedom from fatal chest complaints owing to the singularly mild weather. The average mortality from chest complaints is 3.7 per thousand of the population, or nearly 4 per thousand during January, but during the past five weeks it has only been 2 per thousand. At the same time fatal infectious diseases have been low, the death rate from the zymotic class being nearly 1 per thousand below the average. Prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act. Notices were served on the owners of 8, Charlton Street, to re drain the premises. After considerable delay a summons was issued against the supposed owner, who, however, was able to prove that he was wrongly designated as owner. A new summons was taken out, and on the defendants agreeing to make a new connection to the sewer, to ventilate the drain, and to provide an interceptor, the summons was withdrawn. The works have since been executed. A kitchen at 130, Great Titchfield Street, was found to be illegally occupied, and an order obtained from the Magistrate for the tenants to vacate in three weeks. The time was up on January 24th, and again adjourned to await completion of ejectment proceedings taken by defendant against tenant. Hospital Accommodation for Measles. There is a proposal to provide hospital accommodation for cases of measles. The cases of measles are so numerous in an epidemic, and many of the cases so slight, that it would neither be wise nor very practical to attempt to deal with measles in the same way as with cases of scarlet fever, of which latter cases something like 30 per cent. are treated in the Asylums Board Hospitals. At the same time it must be conceded that there are severe attacks occurring in tenements in which the little patient, owing to unfortunate surroundings, has small chance of recovery. Therefore, there ought to be some moderate provision made for the purpose of taking a few selected cases.

On four days rain fell, the total fall being equal to 0.77 inch. Winds, N. and N.W. Sunshine, 19 hours, which is equal to 28% of the possible. Barometer. 29.8 inches. The week ending February 17th was similar in weather to the former week; minimum temperature, 30.0°; maximum, 48.8°; mean, 39.6°. On four days rain fell, the total fall being 0.7 inch. Wind, variable. Sunshine, 16%. Mean barometer (low), 29.4 inches. The week ending February 24th was finer but cooler; minimum temperature, 28.9° ; maximum, 45.0° ; mean, 40.0°. Winds, N.W. and S.E.

Sunshine, 18.8%. Mean barometer, 29.5 inches. 12 Births and Deaths. During the four weeks ending March 3rd there have been registered 208 births, and 172 deaths. These births and deaths are divided among the sub-districts as set forth in Table IV. Seventy-one of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 47 North-Western Fever Hospital 2 St. Mary's Hospital 4 University College Hospital 3 London Hospital 1 Children's Hospital, Gt., Ormond Street 2 Cancer Hospital, Fulham Road 1 Paddington Workhouse 1 „ Infirmary 1 St. Pancras Infirmary 1 Chelsea Infirmary 1 Westminister Workhouse 1 Han well Asylum 1 Camberwell House Asylum 1 Cane Hill Asylum 1 Sick Asylum, Hendon 1 Friedenheim 1 In the Street 1 Total 71 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the five weeks' statistics are as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 15.8; death-rate 18.0. St. Mary, birth-rate 16.8 ; death-rate 16.1. Christ Church, birth-rate 28.9; death-rate 14.1, St. John, birth-rate 17.8 ; death-rate 20.9. The whole district, birth-rate 203; death-rate 16.8. The average death-rates for ten years (1895 to 1905) for the corresponding period were as follows:—All Souls, 17.4; St. Mary, 22.2; Christ Church, 29.9 ; St. John, 20.1: the whole district, 21.2. The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes or disease and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes. 13 TABLE I.—District Births and Deaths for the four weeks ending MARCH 3RD, 1906.

A Health Society has been formed in the Borough, to cooperate with the Local Authority in ameliorating general sanitary conditions, and especially for the purpose of attempting to do whatever may be practicable in the prevention of consumption and the diminution of infant mortality. With regard to consumption, no age is exempt, the infant at the breast and the octogenarian alike are often infected by the minute parasite; but the special age favouring its development is that of the working period of life, which renders the prevention of the malady so important from every point of view—humanitarian, social, national. The connection of the malady with poverty, for instance, may be illustrated by the following recent case:— F. C. N., male, aged 38, admitted into St. Marylebone Infirmary March 6th suffering from phthisis. He leaves at home a wife and five children, the wife expecting to be confined in three weeks time, the family live in a small two-roomed back cottage, rent 6s. weekly. The wife will receive for thirteen weeks contributions from a slate club, beginning at 10s. and decreasing to 6s.; after the thirteenth week, this source of income ceases. Quite irrespective of the question of clothes and incidental expenses to pay rent and to buy food and firing, the lowest sum which would support this family in the bare necessaries of life would be 16s. per week. The bearing of such sad cases on public health is sufficiently obvious. Given seven persons in two rooms, one of them being consumptive, there is a good chance of the seeds of the malady being implanted in one or more of the remaining six, and it is in such cases that a voluntary organisation 15 like the St. Marylebone Health Society may do much good by keeping the family under sympathetic supervision, and obtaining early treatment should any symptoms of consumption appear. Much good may also be done in the prevention of infant mortality, no small proportion of which is due to improper feeding. The general lowering of the birth-rate renders even more important than formerly the preservation of the children that are born. Scott Ellis Gardens. The fine block of buildings on the Howard de Walden Estate in Grove Road is now complete. The blocks however do not materially assist the housing problem, out of the 388 separate tenements only 216 are of sufficiently low rent to be inhabited by ordinary artisans. The remainder may be described as residental flats, as the following schedule of rents show:— 2 rooms and scullery at 8/- weekly 216 3 „ „ 12/- „ 72 4 ,, „ 16/- ,, 48 4 ,, ,, 14/- ,, 8 3 „ ,, and bath-room from £45 to £70 per annum 44 388 16 TABLE II.—Causes of, and Ages at, Death during the four weeks ending March 3rd, 1906, in the Borough of St. Marylebone.

The curve of notifiable disease week by week, opposite page 30, and the Comparative Table No. 1, with the deathrates, all show that the March quarter of 1906 is quite a record one with regard to low mortality and absence of infectious disease. Measles. The London County Council has adopted the undermentioned regulations for the exclusion from school of children suffering from measles, or coming from houses where measles exists:— "Children suffering from measles must be excluded for at least one month. Children coming from houses where measles exists, but who are not themselves suffering from the disease, should be dealt with as follows:— (i.) A child attending other than an infants' school who has had measles need not be excluded from attendance at school. (ii.) A child attending other than an infants' school who has not had measles must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of 14 days from the occurrence of the first case. (iii.) A child attending an infants' school, whether or not it has had measles, must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of 14 days from the occurrence of the last case." This procedure supersedes the existing regulation— sub-section (v.) of section (c) of Article 111 of the provisional School Management Code. 27 Prosecution under the Public Health (London) Act. One of the few bye-laws made under the above Act, by the London County Council, which meets with unconditional approval is that which provides a penalty for persons who commence sanitary work without giving notice to the Local Authority, and also provides a penalty for certain classes of sanitary work which is not properly executed; the public in this way receive protection. A builder, named G. Pannett, was prosecuted recently under the before-mentioned bye-laws, and fined £1 and costs for not giving notice in the first place, and a similar penalty for executing the work in an unsatisfactory manner. Sale of Food and Drugs Act (Table II). The quarter was mainly devoted to sampling at the various licensed premises. Each licensed house was visited by an inspector or his agent, and samples of gin, brandy, rum, or whisky taken without formality, just in the same way as an ordinary purchaser might do, with the result that out of 175 samples taken 32 or 17.5 per cent. were below the alcoholic strength required by the Act. The houses from which these samples were derived were then again visited and samples taken under the Act with all due formality, but since'each of the premises visited had a more or less conspicuous notice that the spirits sold were diluted, the Solicitor concluded that there was no case for prosecution. The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts may, therefore, be said to be a dead letter in this district so far as spirits are concerned. The question of "What is Whisky ?" was not gone into, pending the appeal in the celebrated Islington case ; it may, however, be said that most of the whiskies were blends of patent and other spirits. It can hardly be considered satisfactory that a general announcement should be a protection against the operation of the Act; obviously the statute requires amendment. 23 TABLE II.—SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS.

The important extension of the baths at the shelter is practically complete. There is now the following accommodation: three baths for men, three for women, and five for children (two being for male and three for female children), total number, eleven. Appointment of Chief Sanitary Inspector. My own opinion with regard to increase of staff did not entirely accord with that of the special committee, nor with that of the Council. I would have preferred to have seen the medical side of the work more developed rather than what may be called the constructional, especially as the appointment of a chief sanitary inspector in other districts does not appear to have been uniformly successful. The Council have, however, adopted the view that it is desirable to have a superior officer, and this being so it is the duty of the department to see that there is 110 friction after his appointment, and that the greatest use of his services be obtained. The duties are not yet defined, but before advertising these will be settled by the Public Health Committee. 41 TABLE II.—TABLE OF POPULATION, BIETH8, AND OF NEW CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, coming to the knowledge, of the Medical Officer of Health, in the Sanitary District of ST.

These births and deaths are divided among the four sub-districts as set forth in Table IV.; 62 of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 33 North-Western Fever Hospital 1 St. Mary's Hospital 4 Children's Hospital, Paddington 2 St. George's Hospital 2 Westminster Hospital 1 Grosvenor Hospital, Vincent Square 1 French Hospital 1 German Hospital 1 St. Peter's Home, Pembridge Square 2 Claybury Asylum 2 Colney Hatch Asylum 2 Hanwell Asylum 2 Hoxton Asylum 1 Leavesden Asylum 1 Peckham House Asylum 1 Brompton Hospital 1 Throat Hospital, Golden Square 1 Brook House 1 Wandsworth Union Infirmary 1 Islington Infirmary 1 Total 62 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the four weeks' statistics are as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 13.6; death-rate 11.0.

Includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Influenza, Whooping Cough Erysipelas, Croup, Fever, and Diarrhoea. 3. Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. Health of the District. The district continues to show excellent health records, with the exception that, as shown by the curve, there is a considerable excess in the notifications of scarlet fever. The hot dry weather has also produced an unusual excess of complaints as to offensive odours from accumulations of manure. The inspectors are directing special attention to this 50 subject, and the various manure notices requiring a removal of manure three times a week have been renewed. Notices have also been served upon various offenders. There may come a time in the future horseless age when this source of annoyance will be abolished. Prosecutions under the Public Health Act. The owner of 165, Great Portland Street was summoned under the Act for defective drains, and absence of a proper water supply. The Magistrate granted a closing order. Messrs. H. and E. Lea, of Warwick Street, were summoned for not depositing plans and necessary notices of drainage of a new building erected at No. 66, Oxford Street, as required by the Bye-laws of the London County Council. The Magistrate fined the defendants £2, with costs. Notification of Erysipelas. The writer has more than once expressed an opinion that it serves no useful purpose to notify erysipelas. Erysipelas is a disease that shows but slight tendency to spread : it may be said to be inoculable rather than contagious. In other words it is rare for erysipelas to spread from person to person, save the seeds of the malady obtain entrance into the system through a wound or some abrasion of the skin; besides which the majority of cases notified are trivial cases. In this district, in a small number, there have been special circumstances rendering disinfection desirable; but for the most part the certificates are simply filed, and this is the routine practice of the majority of the local authorities. Stepney has once again raised the question, and in a circular letter state that they have resolved to urge the Local Government Board to amend the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, by removing erysipelas from the list of notifiable diseases. The Public Health Committee of St. Marylebone have expressed their concurrence in this view. 51 TABLE 11.—TABLE OF POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES OP INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, in the Sanitary District of ST.

Health of the District during the Quarter. The general mortality of the district keeps below the average. The notifications of infectious diseases are also less than usual. The Council have taken an important step in the official recognition of consumption as a preventable disease. During the ensuing twelve months, should medical men notify cases of consumption, such notifications will be paid for at the ordinary rate. This, although as yet imperfectly known, has already borne fruit; a good many notifications have recently come in which it is reasonable to believe would not have been received under any other circumstances. It must not be supposed that the information is merely utilised for statistical purposes; each case is visited, and should the circumstances require it, the case is 61 reported to the St. Marylebone Health Society, which Society has a .staff of workers who give useful advice, and not infrequently valuable assistance, much appreciated by the sufferer. Should the patient be removed to a sanatorium, or the case terminate in recovery or death, the room or rooms are disinfected free of charge. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. 130 samples were analysed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts ; of these 17 were returned as adulterated. The adulterated samples were 14 milks, 2 butters, and 1 coffee. Summonses were taken out in all these cases, save in the case of 2 milks, which were so near the standard as to render a conviction doubtful. Some of the cases are still sub juclice, but the results of those that have been heard are as follows: Mrs. Moore, of 115, Cleveland Street, was convicted for selling milk diluted with 4.8 per cent, water and deficient in milk fat to the extent of 5.34 per cent. The defendant was fined 10s. and 14s. costs. F. S. Brewer, of 00, Cleveland Street, was fined £1 and 14s. costs for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 10 per cent. James Hall, of 104, Marylebone Lane, was fined £3 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling milk diluted with 16 per cent, of water. James Chard, of 22, Nutford Place, was fined £1 and 12s. 0d. costs for selling milk diluted with 146 per cent, water and deficient in milk fat to the extent of 10 per cent. James Tompkins, of 56, Bell Street, was fined £1 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling milk diluted with 13 per cent, of water. Emily Neal, of 6, Salisbury Street, was fined 7s. 6d. and 12s. 6d. costs for selling milk diluted with 7'3 per cent, of water. 62 Ellon Finucane, of 71, Salisbury Street, was fined £1 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling margarine instead of butter. For a. similar offence Arthur Picken, of 458, Edgware Road was fined £l and 12s. 6(1. costs. Elizabeth Smallwood was fined 10s. and 12s. costs for selling coffee mixed with 30 per cent, chicory. Two of the samples of milk had traces of borax. One milk was preserved with formalin. With regard to preservatives in milk a recent circular letter issued by the Local Government Board states that in the opinion of the Board based upon the report of the Departmental Committee on Preservatives and Colouring Matters in Food and also on further evidence, milk traders are able to conduct their business without the use of preservatives and that when a preservative is found in milk the case should in ordinary circumstances be regarded as one for the institution of proceedings. As regards formalin and boron preservatives " the Board are advised the presence in milk of formalin to an amount which is ascertained by examination within three days of collecting the sample to exceed 1 part in 40,000 (1 part in 100,000 of formic aldehyde) raises a strong presumption that the article has been rendered injurious to health and that the purchaser has been prejudiced in the above sense ; and also that similar presumption is raised where boron preservatives are present in milk to an amount exceeding 57 parts of boric acid per 100,000 or 40 grains of boric acid per gallon." A few tinned or canned goods were examined, these were all sterile and of healthy materials ; a tin of shrimps, however, contained borax, a quite unnecessary addition. It is proposed, in view of the statements that have been made as to the preparation of canned meats in Chicago, to examine methodically during the next three months a numof canned meats; the examination has indeed already commenced. 63 TABLE II.—SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS.

A burst of scarlet fever occurred during the first week of August, which rapidly subsided, the cases falling a little below the average. Similarly during August and September diphtheria threatened to become epidemic, but is at the present moment well below the average. Notwithstanding the hot weather there has been less fatal diarrhoea among infants than usual. The average number of deaths during the previous ten years from diarrhoea was 74, the maximum 146 (1899), minimum 47. The deaths from diarrhoea during the past thirteen weeks amount to 67, which is a number well below the average. Prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act. Mr. Benjamin, of Mortimer Street, was summoned for causing work to be executed without giving notice or depositing plans for certain sanitary work, and also for executing the work contrary to the bye laws. The defendant was fined £2, with 12s. 6d. costs, on both counts. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Forty samples of milk were examined during the quarter. In no case were preservatives detected, but two of the samples of milk were adulterated, and the cases are sub judice. A large number of canned and bottled goods were examined, nearly all of them being test samples, and, therefore, not divided according to the Act. A detailed report, giving the results of the examination, has been presented to the Public Health Committee. The goods, according to the labels, were, for the most part, derived from the States, more particularly in the case of corned beef, brawns and meats, generally from the canning establishments of Chicago, a few were from English firms and the Colonies. It may be stated generally that by far the greater portion of these canned goods were of excellent quality and perfectly fit for food, but some of 87 the samples of Chicago brawn were filthy, containing bits of straw, wood-fibre, hair, hogs bristles, and dirt, giving one the idea that in the anxiety to waste nothing even the floor sweepings had been added to the tins. In 56 % of the samples small quantities of boric acid were found, obviously a quite unnecessary addition, for other samples were absolutely free from boric acid or other preservative. The list includes a number of bottled tomato ketchup, in one of these, derived apparently from the United States, benzoic acid to the extent of more than 20 grains to the lb. was detected. In another sample benzoic acid was also detected, but the quantity has not yet been ascertained. Benzoic, salicylic, boric acids are all antiseptics, and there are grounds for believing that their use interferes with healthy digestion. Our intestines are not constructed on a plan which necessitates daily disinfection. The extensive use of small quantities of chemicals, foreign to our natural food and to the body, may well be one of the causes of the numerous cases of indigestion so constantly met with. The trader in canned and bottled goods in buying stock has to depend greatly on the representations of the manufacturer, and his only safety at present lies in some form of guarantee that no antiseptic has been added. The Public Health Committee have expressed their intention of putting the law in force against the vendors of canned and bottled goods, if such goods are found to contain any injurious chemicals for the purpose of preservation. This statement may therefore be taken as a note of warning. Traders in the Borough should examine any old stocks of canned and bottled goods, and should they be ascertained to be doctored in any way it will be wise to destroy the same. The newer consignments from the States and elsewhere appear to be fairly free from adulteration, evidently the revelations as to the method of manufacture has produced in the case of certain firms much needed reformation. 88 TABLE II.—TABLE OF POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, comity to the knowledge, of the Medical Officer of Health, in the Sanitary District of ST.

These births and deaths are divided among the four sub-districts as set forth in Table IV. Seventy of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 46 St. Mary's Hospital 7 North-Western Fever Hospital 7 Western Fever Hospital 1 St. George's Hospital 1 Charing Cross Hospital 1 Guy's Hospital 1 City of London Asylum 1 Banstead Asylum 1 St. Pancras Infirmary 1 St. Joseph's Home 2 In the streets 1 Total 70 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the five weeks' statistics are as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 15.0; death-rate 9.1. St. Mary, birth-rate 16.7; death-rate 14.0. Christ Church, birth-rate 34.2; death-rate 15.2. St. John, birth-rate 18.3; death-rate 18.3. The whole district, birth-rate 21.7; death-rate 13.7.

The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes of disease and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes. 103 TABLE I.

Includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Influenza, Whooping Cough Erysipelas, Croup, Fever, and Diarrhoea. 3. Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. Health of the District. It will be seen by the curve opposite page 106 that in the early part of October, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and even enteric fever, all showed a sudden increase; the number of cases of scarlet fever especially rose far above the average. This sudden burst of zymotic disease, however, rapidly subsided, and the notifications fell a little below a ten years' average. The Collection of Dust. The Council will shortly have to deal with the question of a new contract for the removal of dust from the south division. The writer is of opinion that a more frequent collection than once a week from most of the private houses in the south division is desirable. The large increase of gas 104 fires, especially for cooking purposes, has made the refuse of a more offensive character than formerly. An ordinary cooking range is capable of burning much vegetable and animal debris without offence, but where gas is used such facilities do not exist. It is true that it would be quite easy to arrange in every house a small crematorium heated by gas, but such an appliance, to be of any use in assisting to a solution of dealing with the house refuse, must be adopted generally, and this general adoption is not at all probable. At the present time business houses, flats and public institutions are dealt with specially, but there remain a number of exceptionally large houses from which the dust is only removed once a week, and there is, without doubt, some nuisance, especially in the warmer months, from this cause. 105 TABLE II.—Giving the Causes of Deaths during October, 1906, at the Middlesex Hospital, Queen Charlotte's Lying-in-Hospital, Samaritan Hospital, the Workhouse, the Hospital of St. John and Elizabeth, and the Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill, W.

During the four weeks ending December 1st there have been registered 168 births, and 129 deaths. These births and deaths are divided among the four sub-districts as set forth in Tables V. and VI. Fifty of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows :— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 31 St. Mary's Hospital 5 North-Western Hospital 1 University College Hospital 1 German Hospitai 2 Infant's Hospital, Hampstead 1 Hoxton Asylum 1 Bethlem Asylum 1 St. Luke's Asylum 1 Colney Hatch Asylum 1 Claybury Asylum 1 Banstead Asylum 1 St. Joseph's Home 1 Friedenheim 1 In the Surrey Canal 1 Total 50 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the four weeks' statistics are as follows :— All Souls, birth-rate 16.2; death-rate 11.8. St. Mary, birth-rate 12.3; death-rate 15.8. Christ Church, birth-rate 24.7: death-rate 8.6. St. John, birth-rate 14.6; death-rate 15.9. The whole district, birth-rate 16.4; death-rate 12.6.

The Owner of 317, Regent Street, was summoned for neglecting to obey a notice with regard to a defective drain. A magistrate's order to do the work within 14 days was granted. Mr. J.W. West of Harley Mews North, was summoned for doing Sanitary Work without giving notice and also for not executing the work in accordance with the London County Council bye-laws in respect to Nos. 19 and 20, Harley Mews North. The defendant was fined 10s. with 2s. costs on each of the four summonses. 114 Diphtheria in Schools. It has long been known that when diphtheria is prevalent, what used to be considered ordinary sore throat is likely to be really a diphtheritic sore throat, and such throats when examined bacteriologically are found to contain the particular parasitic organism generally held to be the cause of diphtheria. More than this, it has also been found on the apparently healthy throats of children who have been associated with children suffering from diphtheria. Such children, although not affected themselves, may act as carriers of the malady to other children. There is no more valuable method of arresting the spread in epidemic times of diphtheria in a school than to have a bacteriological examination made of the throat of every child attending the school, healthy or otherwise, and segregating the "infectious carriers." A recent regulation of the Education Department of the London County Council is based upon the above facts. When Diphtheria is present the following letter will in future be sent by the Education Department to the parents or other persons responsible for the child. London County Council. Education Offices, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 190 School. Dear Sir (or Madam), While diphtheria is present in the district I shall be glad if you will exclude any child suffering from sore throat, and forward the name and address to the Medical Officer (Education), the Medical Officer of Health for the District, and the Divisional Superintendent. The child should not be allowed to resume attendance until a certificate (bused upon bacteriological examination) has been furnished stating that it is free from infection. 115 This precaution is necessary to prevent the spread of the disease. If necessary this certificate can be obtained from the local Medical Officer of Health. This rule will apply until further instructions are sent you Yours faithfully. JAMES KERR, M.D., Medical Officer (Education). It will be observed that the regulation only applies to those actually suffering from sore throat, and does not apply to children apparently well who have been in contact with diphtheria cases ; it, therefore, does not go quite far enough but probably as far as can be at present enforced. The London County Council By-laws as to Closets. The Medical Officer of the London County Council has addressed to the writer a circular letter as to difficulties (if any) in working the by-laws and asking for suggestions. In this district, and doubtless in others, much real inconvenience has been experienced in the endeavour to strictly comply with the by-laws as to the construction of new closets in relation to the adjacent areas. The by-laws in question have been made under the powers conferred by Section 39, of the Public Health fLondon) Act and stripped of verbiage have the following effect with regard to adjacent areas:— A person must not erect a watercloset on the ground or other floors above the basement, unless one wall at least is an external wall and abuts immediately "upon the street, or upon a yard or garden or open space of not less than 100 square feet of superficial area, measured horizontally at a point below the level of the floor of such closet" ( it will be observed that as no width is mentioned such space may be a mere gutter 1 foot wide and 100 feet long). With regard to water-closets constructed below the surface of the ground such are to be approached "directly from an area or other open space available for ventilation 116 measuring at least 40 superficial feet in extent and having a distance across of not less than 5 feet, and not covered in otherwise than by a grating or railing" In old buildings many water-closets are in unhealthy and inconvenient positions, and it is desirable that they should be reconstructed in better places, but unless a site for the new construction can be found which satisfies the by-law, such closets cannot be legally moved. The Sanitary Acts require a certain amount of watercloset accommodation in proportion to the persons inhabiting a house or working in a workshop or factory, but, in the central districts, it is often impracticable, without infringing the by-law, to provide the necessary closets. With regard to upstair closets, the writer fails to see the virtue of a hundred square feet; all that should he required is a perfectly sanitary, well constructed, well flushed appliance, and a well ventilated room to receive such appliance. With regard to basement closets; the question of providing sanitary closets at a depth below the surface of the ground has been settled by engineers long ago. Not to mention the numerous Public Underground Conveniences there is a multiplicity of examples in the City, in Hotels, and in the business premises of London generally of underground lavatories which cannot be said to be in any sense of the word, nuisances, but are nevertheless destitute of the 40 square feet of open area. Hard and fast rules with regard to construction of neccessary appliances are not conducive to progress, and the best way would be to repeal the by-laws mentioned giving the Local Authorities power to sanction any construction that is healthy, and to object to any construction that is likely to be unhealthy.
