EACHUS WILKINSON, M.D., &c., Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, According to annual custom, I have the honour of submitting to you my Report of the Sanitary State of the Lewisham District for the year 1879; which year, judging from the rate of mortality, was above the average of healthiness of several previous years. The population estimated to the middle of the year 1879 amounted to 67,084, living in 10,908 houses. In Table I., will be found the estimated population, inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages, which have occurred in the district during the year 1879, and the ten previous years. In Table II., the annual rate of mortality, death rates amongst children, and death rates at the public institutions. In Table III, the deaths registered at several groups of ages from different causes during the year. In Table IV., the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and proportions to population, and to 1,000 deaths in 1879. In Table V., the number of deaths in the 10 years 1869 to 1878 inclusive, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, and the number in 1879. In Table VI., the Inspectors' Report of sanitary work done during the year. In Table VII., the number of inhabited houses, the estimated population, 1879, with the birth and death rate in the Registrar's Sub-districts in Lewisham Parish and the Hamlet of Penge, together comprising "the Lewisham District." 2 In Table VIII, the area, census population in 1861 and 1871, estimated population in 1879, and the mortality in various Metropolitan Districts, and in England and Wales, &c. In Table IX., the population, persons to an acre, births and deaths, annual birth and death rates, mean temperature and rainfall, in the year 1879, in London and twenty-two other large towns of the United Kingdom, and in the Lewisham District. In Table X., the numbers of children between the ages of 3 and 13 years attending public elementary and certified efficient schools in the Parish of Lewisham, and in the Hamlet of Penge during the year 1879. In Table XI., a register of the licensed cow houses in the district, together with a list of the milk sellers in the district who have not licenses. In Table XII., a list of the licensed slaughter houses in the district. Marriages. During the year 1879, 414 marriages took place in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 354 were solemnized in the several Church of England Churches in the Parish, 31 in Noncomformist Chapels, and 29 at the Register Office. One hundred and six marriages took place in the Hamlet of Penge, of which 95 were solemnized in Church of England Churches, 8 in Nonconformist Chapels, and 3 at the Register Office. Births. The registered births in the district in the year 1879 amounted to 2,106; 1,053 males, 1,053 females. The birth rate to population was 31.39 per 1,000. In London 134,096 births were registered, the annual birth rate being 36.5 per 1,000. In England and Wales 882,866 births were registered, the annual birth rate being 35.1 per 1,000. The natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths in the Lewisham District was 1,143. 3 Deaths. The number of deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1879 was 963, or 95 less than the number registered during the year 1878; 472 deaths took place amongst males, and 491 amongst females. The annual rate of mortality per 1,000 was 14.35, a lower death rate than that registered during the previous year, and a lower death rate than the average of England and Wales or the Metropolitan Districts. The annual rate of mortality of England and Wales in 1879 was 21.0; in the Metropolitan and City Police Districts 22.0; in Registration London 23.3; and in the districts outside Registration London 16.3. By reference to Table III., which gives the mortality registered at several groups of ages, it will be seen that of the 963 deaths registered from all causes in 1879, 255 took place under 1 year of age, and 389 under the age of 5 years. 255 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 82 between the ages of 1 and 2 52 „ „ „ 2 „ 5 32 „ „ „ 5 „ 15 30 „ „ „ 15 „ 25 60 „ „ „ 25 „ 35 69 „ „ „ 35 „ 45 61 „ „ „ 45 „ 55 91 „ „ „ 55 „ 05 114 „ „ „ 65 „ 75 70 „ „ „ 75 „ 85 31 „ „ „ 85 „ 95 4 „ „ „ 95 and upwards. Of the diseases which produced the mortality at these ages:— 125 deaths took place from zymotic diseases. 210 „ „ constitutional diseases 427 „ „ local diseases. 167 „ „ developmental diseases. 15 „ „ violent deaths. 13 „ „ not specified or ill defined 4 Preventable Diseases. The seven principal zymotic diseases viz., small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, fever, and diarrhoea, caused 94 deaths, or 1.40 per 1,000 of the population of the district, a number considerably below the average of the past 10 years, and below the number registered in 1878. The proportion of deaths from zymotic diseases to 1,000 deaths from all causes in ten years—1869 to 1878—was in London 186.3, in England and Wales 163.6, and in this District 154.6. Small-Pox—No death occurred from Small-pox daring the year 1879. The annual average of the ten years—1869 to 1878—amounted to 3.3 of the entire population. Measles.—The annual average for the past ten years from measles has been 14.6. This year the mortality from measles has amounted to 32. Scarlet Fever.—Eleven deaths have taken place from scarlet fever. The annual average of ten years—1869 to 1878—being 27.7. Diphtheria.—Four deaths took place from diphtheria. The annual average of ten years being 7.5. Whooping Cough.—Twenty-four deaths occurred from this cause in 1869. The annual average of ten years having been 26.2. Fever. Nine deaths took place from fever. The annual average of ten years having been 18.0. Diarrhœa. Fourteen deaths took place from diarrhœa. The annual average of ten years having been 37.3 of the population. Water Supply. With regard to water supply the important question for the sanitary authority is its sufficient quantity, and its proper filtration before distribution. This district is supplied from two sources, viz.—By the Lambeth Company, who obtain their supply from the River Thames, and the Kent Company, who obtain their supply form deep chalk wells. 5 Quoting from the Reports of Dr. Frankland, the latter water, although not filtered, is always pure and bright. The quality of the Thames water is found to be variable, the variations being not more than about 32 grains of solid matter in the gallon. In the month of February there is usually the highest average, and in the month of August the lowest, much depending upon the amount of rainfall producing floods, &c. Of the river water taken from the Thames, the best average supplies were furnished by the Lambeth and Chelsea Companies, but the river waters were much inferior to the deep-well waters which were uniformly pure and wholesome. Foul Cisterns. The purity of the water supplied by the Companies is of diminished importance, if the cisterns for storing the water are kept in a foul state from the connection between the overflow pipe, and the closet or drain ; or from neglect in placing cisterns in accessible situations, so that they may be easily and frequently cleansed. The Board of Trade regulations, 1872, relative to waste pipes provide that no overflow or waste pipe other than a warning pipe shall be attached to any cistern supplied with water by a company. The great and important remedy for the fouling of water in cisterns, however, will be their entire removal, and the substitution of a constant supply; which the companies should be prepared to give without delay. Sewer Gases. Continued and watchful care is required to prevent the ingress of foul air into dwelling houses from sewers and drains. Houses are constantly found which communicate with drains by waste pipes, overflow pipes, sink pipes, waterclosets, soil pipes within the house, bath pipes, and basin pipes ; and although supposed to be secured by what are called traps, still, from various causes, admit poisonous gases, laden with the germs of infection. A great deal 6 of trouble has been taken to get these dangers remedied in the construction of new houses in this district, but still constant supervision is requisite in old as well as new dwelling houses. No soil pipe should be constructed within a house, and no house should in any way communicate with a sewer, but should have its connection broken between the house and drain traps, so that any foul gases can only get vent into the open air. Cow Houses and Dairies. As milk often constitutes the sole diet of infants and invalids, it becomes of the most serious importance that this nutritious food should be of a pure quality. The surroundings of cow houses and dairies should bo kept scrupulously clean, and in the event of any case of sickness amongst the cows, the animal should be kept separate from others, and the milk from the diseased animal thrown away. The attendance upon cows by those who have recently been the subject of epidemic disease, should be forbidden. The water used for the washing of cans must also be of a pure description, and not drawn from a dirty cistern or well. The requirements for cow-houses are, that—There must be a cubic space of 800 feet for each cow; the sides and floornig of the cow house must be of some solid and impervious material; there must be proper light and ventilation; proper paving and drainage of the cow house and adjoining yard; a good water supply; a properly constructed dung-pit; and a clean, covered, impervious receptacle for grains. The cow houses must be cleansed, and the manure removed therefrom, twice daily; and all refuse removed from the premises at least three times a week before 7 a.m. The Board's Hospital. The Hospital for the reception of patients suffering from epidemic disease is now the freehold property of the Board of 7 Works of the Lewisham District, and preparations arc made for the completion of a new building. It is well situated, being in a locality far away from inhabited houses and at a good elevation, and has a resident nurse ready for the reception of patients. Ambulances are kept at Lewisham and Penge for the conveyance of patients suffering from infectious disease The importance of this establishment cannot be overestimated, for whenever a case of epidemic disease is removed in order to prevent its communication to others, it confers a benefit to the general public. On this ground the payment for maintenance and medical attendance should be as low as possible to the friends of the patient. Disinfection. One Disinfecting apparatus, for the purpose of disinfecting the wearing apparel, bedding, &c., of those who have suffered from epidemic disease, is placed at Lewisham, and another at Penge. Covered iron carts are in readiness to fetch and deliver apparel, &c. Latrines. The establishment of Latrines in the district has been under consideration. Baths and Wash-houses. The establishment of Baths and Wash-houses in the different divisions of the district is also of great importance, but whether this should be taken up by the Board, or by a public company formed for the purpose, is a matter of opinion. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E. WILKINSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the Lewisham District. 8 TABLE I.

I am glad to say that during the year there were no great floods. I was engaged in preparing some modified plans for the Improvement of the Ravensbourne and Quaggy, but there are many difficulties in the way, and negotiations are going on. The Bridge in Eastdown Park that was washed away by the flood in April, 1878, was Re-built at the joint expense of the Metropolitan, Lewisham, and Plumstead Boards. I made the drawings, and earned out the work. The work was done in winter, and there was great difficulty in putting the foundations in. Two 24-inch iron pipes were laid under the abutments of the bridge in order to 9 carry the sewage from Ennersdale and other Roads in the neighbourhood. A great many plans, &c., were prepared during the year, and my correspondence increases very much. I append a list of the New Streets sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works during the year. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Surveyor to the Board. The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. NEW STREETS SANCTIONED. Name of New Street.
