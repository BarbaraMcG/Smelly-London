' ■ INTRODUCTION BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH Telephone No: PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Elinb ridge 6441-8. Ext. 25 2, SHALSTON VILLAS, SURBITON. June 1960. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Annual Report 1959. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the Public Health and Social conditions of the Borough for 1959. The Report is compiled in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. 1/60, dated 8th January, I960, and follows a similar pattern to that for previous years. I am pleased to report on the continued satisfactory state of Public Health in the Borough during the year. Population: The home population as given by the RegistrarGeneral is 63,750, an increase of 200 on the figures for 1958. This is a continuation of the trend manifest throughout the history of the Borough. Housing and office accommodation for the increasing population is a constant requirement calling for increasing attention by the Corporation. Infectious Diseases; The number of infectious disease notifications received in 1959 was 1,337 compared with 450 for 1958. This increase is attributed mainly to the 1,139 cases of Measles, and although there was no large scale outbreak of Dysentery, the number of cases is 95 more than the previous year. I am pleased to record the absence of Diphtheria in the Borough since 1946, and have pleasure also to report that for the second year in succession no case of Poliomyelitis was notified or discovered. Reference is made to the campaign of vaccination against poliomyelitis carried out during 1959 on page 18. Two small outbreaks of food poisoning are noteworthy, not because they were alarming or extensive, but because they were recognised quickly and investigation by the Chief Public Health Inspector was prompt and effective leading to the discovery and proof of the causal organism in each case. This is unusual because our investigations are invariably hampered by the inability to find food left over or specimens to prove the illness. One outbreak was of a factory staff whose management immediately called in the Chief Public Health Inspector. Chicken was the offending food and Cl.welchii the causal organism being subsequently recovered both from the chicken and the faeces of the patients who were ill. The other was a private household whose Christmas dinner caused sudden illness from Staph. aureus. Fortunately in both incidents there was quick recovery. 2. Births: The number of live births for 1959 is 853 and compares with 867 for 1958. The birth rate is 13.38 per 1,000 of the population compared with 13.64 for the previous year. Deaths: The number of deaths recorded in 1959 is 615 compared with 641 for 1958. This gives a death rate of 9.64 per thousand of the population compared with 10.08 for 1958. The number of deaths of infants under one year in 1959 is 15giving an Infant Mortality Rate of 17.58 compared with a rate of 16.14 for 1958. The causes of death of these infants will be seen on page 10. Causes of death: The main causes of death during 1959 were:- Heart 226 Cancer 116 Vascular lesions of Nervous System 82 This follows a similar order to that of the preceding years and each group is slightly larger than it was last year. In view of the attention given to the relationships between smoking and lung cancer the relevant figures for Surbiton residents is given below:- 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 M F M F M F M F M F M F Deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus 19 5 21 2 24 6 19 4 26 3 22 4 TOTAL 24 23 30 23 29 26 _ Housing: As in the two previous years, 1959 has been a year of activity in private building. The preoccupation of the developing companies with programmes of demolition of large family houses and packing into their site as many small flats as can be allowed still continues. These new small units lack space and storage accommodation, and very often have no means for the incineration of waste materials requiring such disposal. Once the existing order of a neighbourhood is destroyed there is opportunity for full scope in planning, for example, new conception of communities in larger blocks of flats going higher, with greater densities to allow for the inclusion of further amenities, should be accepted. This should include adequate space, suitable waste and refuse disposal arrangements, and other family requirements, whilst at the same time saving ground space for. off-street parking, garages and landscape gardening, absolutely necessary to maintain and improve the attractive open nature of the district. This needs the acceptance of more comprehensive changes in buildings and their grouping than is practised at present, because 3. of the pressures of population on the available housing space. Such pressure is likely to become more and more acute as office, business and factory development proceeds unless it incorporates in its own neighbourhood dwelling houses as it grows. It seems necessary to pay regard to concern expressed in the Sixteenth Report of the Royal Pine Arts Commission on these and other points, in particular the tendency to concentrate new office and commercial buildings in small central areas often with the object of cramming in the largest amount of lettable floor space in the most sought after areas. Royal Commission: The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London heard oral evidence from your representatives on the character of work required in the Borough in supplementation of its written evidence, and the report of this Commission is awaited with great interest because it may profoundly influence the future development of services in the Borough. Staff: The details of the staff of the Public Health Department are set out on page 1. There has been no change during the year. I am pleased again to record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement throughout the year and to Mr. Eldridge, the Chief Public Health Inspector and his Inspectors, Mr. Elms and the clerical staff and to Dr. W.H. Kinstrie, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.W. STARKEY Medical Officer of Health. 4. GENERAL STATISTICS Area of Borough (in acres) 4,709 Population (June 1959) 63,750 Resident population (Census 1951) 60,875 Estimated number of separate habitable dwellings (houses and flats) in the Borough at 31st March, 1960. 19,900 Number of new houses, flats and maisonettes erected during the year:- (a) By local authority (12 to replace temporary dwellings) 62 (b) By other local authorities Nil (c) By private enterprise 221 (d) 13 properties were converted by private enterprise to provide 45 flats. 3 single houses were each converted into 2 separate dwellings. Rateable value at 31st December, 1959 £1,198,188 Sum represented by a penny rate (estimated)£4,865 SOCIAL CONDITIONS Surbiton is an attractive well favoured residential town with many recreation grounds and open parks. It flanks the river and is close to Epsom Downs, two Royal Parks and Hampton Court Palace. Its population is healthy and enjoys many physical and social amenities. It is mainly a dormitory town but many of the people are engaged in local industry which comprises a variety of trade in small modern factories. It is a good shopping centre and well supplied with communications by road and rail. It is a thriving rapidly developing community requiring constant adequate and long sighted planning in order to preserve its value and amenities through the next twenty years. 5.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Sickness benefit, contacts or carriers of infectious disease. Under the National Insurance Act, 1946, sickness benefit will, in certain circumstances, be payable to persons who are deemed to be incapable of work through being contacts or carriers, although not actually ill themselves. Only exceptionally is it necessary to require contacts or carriers of infectious disease to stay away from work, and then only in the case of more serious infections. The Medical Officer of Health may issue a certificate where there is a special risk saying such a person should absent himself from his employment for a time; and it is in such circumstances that the right to draw sickness benefit is occasioned. Benefit will only be paid on the production of a certificate by a Medical Officer of Health that the person is under medical observation by reason of being a carrier of infectious disease, or has been in contact with a case of infectious disease (as the case may be) in circumstances which make it advisable to exclude him from work. This Act applies particularly to food handlers, e.g. persons employed in cafes, canteens and restaurants. During the year two such certificates were issued. DIPHTHERIA The Borough has now been free from cases of diphtheria since 1946, and if parents will continue to take advantage of the immunisation service offered, there is no reason why the disease should not be entirely stamped out. The responsibility for providing this service rests with the County Council by virtue of section 26 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and the Medical Officer of Health, who is also the Divisional Medical Officer for the County Council, organises the service within the Borough. Administrative work on immunisation is conducted in the Public Health Department on behalf of the County Council for which 35% of a clerk's salary is reimbursed. Arrangements also exist with general medical practitioners to carry out diphtheria and whooping cough immunisation. A doctor taking part is expected to send records to the Authority of the immunisation carried out in the course of his practice; the Authority provides the record cards and pays a fee to the doctor for each completed card received. Doctors are able to collect prophylactic material from the Public Health Department or from the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale. Diphtheria Immunisation Clinics are held at:- Gosbury Hill Clinic, Friday mornings at 1, Gosbury Hill, Hook. 11 o'clock. Telephone. Elmbridge 5737. South Place Clinic, Monday mornings at Ewell Road, Surbiton. 11 o'clock. Telephone; Elmbridge 4897. (or Diphtheria Immunisation may be carried out by patient's own doctor, as described above). 13. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION The number of immunisations carried out during the year was as follows:- Age Group Primary Immunisations during 1959. Reinforcement doses during 1959 Age under 1 year * 576 — Age 1 year 179 41 Age 2 years Age 3 years Age 4 years Age 5-9 years 104 1,226 Age 10 - 14 years * This figure includes children born in 1958 but still under 1 year when immunised in 1959. The following table sets out the number of children immunised in each of the last six years:- Year Primary Immunisations Reinforcements. 1954 746 284 1955 737 132 1956 741 298 1957 691 1,399 1958 799 1,162 1959 859 1,267 14. The number of immunisations carried out between 1st January, 1945 and 31st December, 1959, is shown below:- Under 1 1959 1-4 1955-1958 5-9 1950-1954 10-14 1945-1949 Under 15 Total A.

This represents an improvement on the figures for 1957 and 1958, and reflects the value of the work done in 1959. Parents must not be 'allowed' to become complacent about immunisation against diphtheria, but all personnel engaged in health services must make continued special efforts to endeavour to raise the total figure of immunised persons up to about 75 or 80% of the total population. SMALLPOX Whilst this disease only appears in this country at rare intervals it is still prevalent in many parts of the world and its introduction here is an ever-present threat. Its seriousness is such that the simple precaution of vaccination ought not to be neglected even though it is no longer compulsory to vaccinate infants. Patients of all ages can be vaccinated by their own doctors, whilst children are also dealt with at the Clinics under the control of the Surrey County Council. Calf-lymph for vaccination is obtainable from the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale. 15. The number of nersons who were vaccinated or re-vaccinated during 1959 was:- Age Groups Under 1 1 2-4 5-14 15 or over. TOTAL Vaccinations 590 38 32 28 72 760 Re-vaccinations — — 5 4 212 221 Calculations show that by the end of 1959 some 69.2% of children born between 1st July, 1958 and 30th June, 1959, have been vaccinated. SONNE DYSENTERY The number of cases reported during the year was 123 against 28 for the previous year. The cases mainly occurred in connection with;- (a) A Day Nursery in Kingston. (b) A Children's Home in Berrylands Road. (c) Grand Avenue School, and (d) St. Andrew's School. Whilst the majority of the cases were children a number of adults became infected,as always seems to happen. The usual control measures were put into operation and the outbreaks subsided. The following table shows the number of cases occurring during the past ten years since first recognition of this disease in Surbiton:- 1950: 1951: 1952: 1953: 1954: 1955: 1956: 1957: 1958: 1959: 140 62 — 10 12 25 289 202 28 123 Personal hygiene is of the utmost importance in prevention of spread, especially the washing of hands after use of water-closets and before eating. W.Cs. should be kept scrupulously clean, seats, chain-pulls and door handles in particular being frequently washed with disinfectant. Schools are naturally associated with the dissemination of the illness, but without doubt it also spreads rapidly through households once introduced. It is therefore regarded as a "family" illness necessitating checking of all contacts. This is readily done in the laboratory by examination of faeces, but the task of l6. controlling an outbreak is a major operation calling for close co-operation between laboratory, medical practitioners, teachers, parents and Public Health Department staff. No person who has been a confirmed case (child or adult) is regarded as reasonably free from liability to spread infection until three consecutive negative specimens have been forthcoming. There is much evidence of reversion after two negatives and even of this occurring more than once with the same patient. Sonne Dysentery is a highly infectious disease which can be fatal in very young children, and because of the rapidity with which it spreads it is necessary to move quickly in applying control measures when a case occurs if a large outbreak is to be prevented. The greatest chance of success comes when no time is lost in recognising the condition and notifying it to the Public Health Department so that preventive action can be initiated without delay. POLIOMYELITIS No case has been reported since 1958, and figures since 1950 are given below:-_ Year: 1950: 1951: 1952: 1953: 1954: 1955: 1956: 1957: 1958: 1959: Cases: 8 1 2 3 2 8 1 6 — — Deaths: 1 — 1 — — — — — — — Arrangements are made whereby doctors may collect antipoliomyelitis vaccine from the Public Health Department, and this facility is very much appreciated and used. At the end of the year good progress has been made towards the protection by vaccination of the priority groups for which vaccine had been issued by the Ministry of Health. These groups were:- (a) Children and young persons born on or after 1st January, 1933, providing that in the case of babies they have reached the age of six months; (b) Expectant mothers. At the time of writing the Poliomyelitis vaccination scheme has been extended to include all persons up to the age of 40 years at the date of registration and also to the following small groups:- (a) Persons going to visit or reside in a country outside Europe, other than Canada or the United States of America. (b) Practising dental surgeons, dental students, dental hygienists, student hygienists, dental surgeons' chairside assistants, and their families. (c) Practising nurses not working in hospitals (those working in hospitals are already eligible) and their families. 17. . (d) Public Health staff who might come into contact with poliomyelitis cases, and their families. Vaccination consists of one simple initial injection given into the arm and followed approximately four weeks later by a second, and after a period of seven months by a third, and maybe at a suitable interval a fourth will be called for. This is known to give a workable level of protection in most subjects for several years. POLIOMYELITIS VACCINATION WEEK. In conjunction with the Divisional Health Office and the three other authorities in the division a campaign was organised with the principal object of encouraging those in the 15 - 26 years age group who had not been vaccinated to come forward and be done. Special "open" clinics were held during the week 22nd to 26th June, there being 20 open sessions held and a mobile van toured the Division. A total of 3,872 vaccinations were given, of which 3,181 were first injections. The mobile van accounted for 606. This was a truly rewarding experience because of the splendid spirit of co-operation and friendliness which grew throughout the week between all concerned. It was a combined operation between Health and Civil Defence Departments, County and County District Staffs and Voluntary helpers of the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross Society, the Women's Voluntary Services, Cinema Managers, the Press, and others. Figures for Surbiton are as follows:- Total No. vaccinated during week 759 At South Place Clinic: New cases 308 Previously registered 112 420 At Hook Clinic: New cases 241 Previously registered 98 339 Arrangements were made for the vaccinated persons to receive their second and third injections, thereby giving full protection. FOOD POISONING There were nine confirmed cases notified by general practitioners, the causative organisms were identified as shown below:- Staph, aureus 3 cases. S. typhi-murium 6 cases The ages of the nine persons were as follows:- Adults 5 15 years 2 14 years 1 7 years 1 18. FOOD POISONING (CONTD.) In accordance with instructions contained in Ministry of Health Memorandum 188/Med. "Reports on individual Food Poisoning Outbreak" were sent to the Ministry concerning two such cases occurring in the Borough during the year under review, viz:- 1. An outbreak of food poisoning on 28th and 29th May, 1959, at a works in the Borough. About 50 members of a staff of 60 reported their illness to the Management who immediately requested the Department' help and investigation. Early enquiries pointed towards C1. welchii being the most likely causative organism and the chicken meal served in the canteen at lunch time on the 27th May was suspect. Fortunately a good range of ingredients of this meal were available for bacteriological examination and samples of this were collected, as were faecal specimens from a number of affected persons, including the kitchen staff, some of whom were affected. The Laboratory reports showed that the broth in which the chicken offal was cooked and the offal itself were infected with CI. welchii (type 4) and the identical organism was recovered from all the faeces submitted. There can be little doubt therefore that the source of infection was one or more of the twelve chickens used. These were pre-cooked (boiled) on the 26th May, and from the enquiries made it appears that a contributory factor in causing the outbreak was the slow cooling of a large mass of stock. In such circumstances a period of ideal conditions for a "build-up" of the organisms is created. The illness may be described as being fairly mild (only 1 affected member of the staff failed to report for duty on the 28th May,) and all reported completely recovered by the 29th May. None found it necessary to consult their doctor therefore no case was officially notified. 2. Details concerning the second occurrence are as follows:- This took place in a private household on the evening of the 25th December, 1959 (Christmas Day), involving three persons. Faeces from the affected persons showed a heavy Staph. aureus infection, but vomit was negative. No specimens were obtained from the third victim. Food samples were taken for laboratory investigation and the results are shown hereunder:- Fat from goose - no pathogens Beef dripping - - do - Gravy - - do - Cooked ham - - do - Remains of goose with stuffing - Moderate growth of Staph. aureus. Stuffing (cultured separately) - Heavy growth of Staph. aureus. Bread sauce - - do - A contributory factor in this incident was undoubtedly leaving prepared food in a warm kitchen for some hours. 19. LABORATORY FACILITIES. Extensive use is made of the facilities provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service (directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health); and opportunity is taken to gratefully acknowledge the co-operation of Doctor D.M. Stone and her staff at the Epsom Laboratory to which our specimens are taken. Apart from samples of water, milk, ice-cream and other food (details of which are given under other headings) the undermentioned specimens were collected by the Inspectors in the course of investigating cases of dysentery, typhoid, food poisoning, etc. and taken to the Laboratory:- Year 1951: 1952: 1953: 1954s 1955: 1956: 1957: 1958: 1959: Faeces 694 183 129 263 306 3,704 2,256 610 1,177 Suspected Food. 2 15 12 8 10 6 24 13 36 EXCLUSION FROM SCHOOL. Two hundred and forty-two certificates were issued during the year excluding and re-admitting school cases and contacts of infectious disease. 20. TUBERCULOSIS. At the end of the year 301 persons were shown to be suffering from tuberculosis and living within the district:- Sex Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Males 173 9 Females 101 18 Age Periods NEW CASES DEATHS Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F M F M F Under 1 - - - - - - - - 1-4 1 - - 1 - - - - 5-14 - 2 - - - - - - 15 - 24 6 4 - - - - - - 25 - 34 14 11 - _ 1 - - - 35 - 44 5 5 - - - - - - 45 - 54 12 - - - 1 1 - - 55 - 64 3 1 - - - - - - 65 and over 3 1 1 1 5 - - - Of the 71 new cases tabulated above 46 were transferred from other districts.

It was not necessary to take any action under these regulations during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936, Section 172 No action was taken under this Section. 22. MASS RADIOGRAPHY No visit was made by the Mass X-ray Unit to the Borough during the year. Persons requiring chest x-ray may attend at the Chest Clinic, 27, Queen's Road, Kingston Hill, Telephone No. Kingston 6251, at the following times:- Mondays at 9.30 a.m. Tuesdays at 9.30 a.m. and 2 p.m. Wednesdays at 2 p.m. Thursdays at 9.30 a.m. and 2 p.m. Fridays at 9.30 a.m. Kingston and District Tuberculosis Care Committee. This is a local voluntary Committee which raises funds and dispenses them to aid tuberculous families. It works with the Surrey County Council official services and is formed from representatives of the four District Councils in the North Central Division together with other interested persons. The Town Council appoints two representatives annually and the present representatives are:- Alderman Mrs. A. Woodgate, J.P. and Councillor J.R. Ashton. During the year 1959 an amount of £1,403 was spent on giving help to 94 families of which 23 were Surbiton families. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year 65 persons were medically examined for the Council in connection with staff entering the Superannuation Fund/Sick Pay Schemes, or about to go on pension, as follows.- Superannuation Fund Sick Pay Scheme Special Examinations. 30 29 6 WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE There is in the Borough much voluntary activity devoted to this cause such as provision of weekly clubs, daily centre, arranging seaside holidays, distribution of Christmas gifts and visiting of house-bound. The work is co-ordinated through the Surbiton Old People's Welfare Committee, a voluntary body representative of most walks of life and presided overy by His Worship the Mayor. The Town Council leases to the Committee a large house which, after extensive works of repair and re-decoration, was opened in September 1958 as a Centre for old people, including clubrooms, recreation rooms, handicraft room, chiropody clinic and canteen. 23. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE (CONTD.) A meals on wheels service is operated by the Surbiton Division of the British Red Cross Society, and the Council makes a generous contribution towards the cost involved. The number of subsidised mid-day meals distributed during the year was 4509. The Borough Council has provided ninety-four special flatlets for aged people, and a further twenty is contemplated. There can be no exaggeration of the importance of this work for the old people, or of its increasing urgency as year succeeds year and more survive to the older age groups. It is now imperative that the contributions in money and services by the Local Authorities i.e. County and Borough be extended and continuous co-ordination be exerted over all the field of work. CO-ORDINATION OF HEALTH AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES. In 1957 a committee of the Council was formed to consider and report upon methods of co-operation between the Town Council and other bodies concerned with the health and other social services within the Borough, to assist if required in the co-ordination of such work, and to examine ways of encouraging recruitment of more voluntary workers. The need for such work was indicated by the consideration of the Housing Committee of the previously published report of the Working Party of the Surrey County Council on the Prevention of Break-up of Families. The Committee, and its Sub-Committees, had several meetings and had discussions with representatives of organisations in the Borough, and concluded that there is a need for a closer link between such organisations and the Council. In an endeavour to bring the various organisations in the Borough into closer touch with one another and to integrate the various forms of social service work, the Mayor convened a meeting of local organisations at the Surbiton Assembly Rooms on 10th December, 1959, to discuss the co-ordination of health and other social services, and a full report made to the Town Council, viz:"Over seventy representatives of local societies had attended. The representatives present agreed that a conference of local organisations should be convened at least twice a year by the Mayor for the time being, to afford an opportunity of meeting together to discuss mutual problems. It was also agreed that organisations should be requested to send to the Citizens' Advice Bureau the names and addresses of their officers, details of activities, meeting places, and any other information as to assistance that might be required which could be afforded by mutual co-operation between the organisations. When this information was received it would be possible to complete a comprehensive record of social service organisations in the Borough and particulars could be made available, on request, to any persons or societies seeking fuller details of local social service activities." 24. NURSING IN THE HOME (District Nursing). The Headquarters of the District Nursing Association is at 21-23, Upper Brighton Road (Telephone No. Elmbridge 3027) where application should be made for the services of a district nurse or midwife. Such applications have to be supported by the family doctor under whose direction all home nursing is given. The District Nursing Services are administered by the Surrey County Council through the Divisional Medical Officer who is also Medical Officer of Health for Surbiton. ANTE-NATAL CLINICS The ante-natal clinic can serve as the focal point of all activities relating to the expectant and nursing mother. The health visitor from the ante-natal clinic follows up the case in its own home for the purpose of advising and helping the expectant mother in all matters relating to pregnancy. Mothers are also encouraged to attend these clinics after their confinement to make sure that full health and normality is restored. This service is additional and designed to supplement that which an expectant mother is entitled to receive from a general practitioner and midwife. HOME HELP SERVICE. Persons desiring to avail themselves of this service should apply, supporting their application with a medical certificate, to the Divisional Medical Officer, The Health Centre, Grange Road, Kingston-on-Thames, who will arrange for the Divisional Home Help Supervisor to visit and investigate the application. WATER SUPPLY. The whole of the water supply for the Borough comes from the Metropolitan Water Board and is satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. All premises have a direct mains supply and there are no wells in use. Monthly reports are supplied by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. This dependable first class water supply is a tremendous factor in maintaining the good health of the people of Surbiton. During the year there was some concern as to possible dangers arising from any discharge of radioactive substances into rivers which might affect water supplies, and following correspondence with the Metropolitan Water Board the Chairman of the Public Health Committee and the Medical Officer of Health had a meeting with their Director of Water Examination. The report of that meeting fully satisfied the Council that all possible precautions were being taken and that there was no cause for anxiety. 25. FLUORIDATION OF PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES. The Town Council gave very earnest consideration to this controversial subject and eventually concurred with the views of the Metropolitan Water Board that fluoridation should be postponed until the results of the investigations now being made are announced, and that if the tests prove favourable no time should be lost in proceeding with the fluoridation of public water supplies. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The Hogsmill River is the Borough boundary for some two miles on the eastern side. Now that sewage effluent from Epsom is no longer discharged into it it has become a sparkling stream again and small fish which have been absent for many years have re-appeared. The River Thames is the northern boundary and whilst there is no bathing a pleasant riverside promenade gives much pleasure to many people and boating and yachting are popular pastimes. SWIMMING BATHS. Publicly owned bath. Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide, with a depth of three to nine feet. There is also a paddling pool for small children. The water is from Metropolitan Water Board mains and is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by breakpoint chlorination and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. The Borough Engineer reports that the exceptionally fine weather brought a record attendance, over 200,000 people using the bath which considerably exceeded the previous highest attendance of 173,565 in 1934 (the year the Lagoon was opened). Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and the plant adjusted as necessary. In addition 31 samples were taken by the Public Health Department for chemical and bacteriological examination all of which proved to be satisfactory. School bath. One private school has a small swimming bath which is used only by scholars and staff. Sterilisation is by hand dosing with chlorine coupled with frequent changes of water. Eight samples were taken by the Department to ensure adequate chlorination and fitness for bathing, all of which proved to be satisfactory. REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. Refuse and salvage collection is under the control of the Borough Engineer. The collection was maintained at seven day intervals except when interfered with by holidays and sickness. The refuse is transported to a central loading depot in the Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames, transferred to large haulage wagons and then moved under contract for disposal into privately owned pits. 26. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 to 1959 The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 277 (244 mechanical, 22 non-mechanical, and 11 works of building construction). Three hundred and eighty three visits were made to these premises and work was carried out to remedy contraventions found as under;- Particulars: No. of cases in which defects found and remedied: Insufficient sanitary conveniences. 1 Defective, dirty or inadequately lighted sanitary conveniences. 14 Other offences, etc. 13 27.

UNDERGROUND ROOMS. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government issued new model regulations revised to bring them into conformity with present day standards and asked local authorities to review their own regulations in the light of this model and to submit revised regulations for approval by the Minister. After careful consideration the Council decided to inform the Minister that as they considered the new model regulations to be less exacting than those now in force they wished to retain their present regulations. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS. The Council continued to operate this scheme in cases (a) where new housing accommodation would be provided by the conversion of an existing building,(b) where additional accommodation was to be provided by adding rooms, and (c) where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. These grants are now known as "Discretionary Grants" and are paid solely at the discretion of the local authority with a maximum of £400. per dwelling. On the 14th June, 1959, The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, came into force and required local authorities to make grants towards the cost of providing "standard amenities" in dwellings; and made certain amendments to the existing provisions relating to improvement grants. The standard amenities are (A) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; (B) a washhand basin; (C) a hot water supply; (D) a water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling; (E) satisfactory facilities for storing food. The amount of the "standard grant" which, subject to certain conditions, can be claimed as of right is one half of the cost of the approved works, subject to a maximum of £155 35. IMPROVEMENTS GRANTS (Cont.). This limit of £155. is reduced as follows in respect of amenities which already exist :- Amenity: Reduction: £ Fixed hath or shower in a bathroom 25 Washhand basin 5 Hot water supply 75 Water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling 40 Satisfactory food store 10 Since the operation of the new Act the Tom Council has received twenty-four applications for standard grants of which twenty were approved, three withdrawn and one not recommended.

RENT ACT, 1957. This Act, together with its accompanying regulations has been in operation since 6th July, 1957. The Council has delegated to the Public Health Committee its powers relating to Certificates of Disrepair, and this materially helps in dealing with applications in an expeditious manner which is so important in common fairness to the parties concerned. The position up to the end of the year is shown in the following summary 6th July to 31 st Dec. 1957 1958. 1959. (1) No. of applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) 61 56 25 (2) No. of decisions not to issue Certificates 3 1 1 (3) No. of decisions to issue Certificates - (a) in respect of some but not all defects listed by tenants. 40 36 16 (b) in respect of all defects listed 1 2 13 8 (4) No. of undertakings to remedy defects given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule (Form K. ) 27 34 19 (5) No. of such undertakings refused by Council Nil Nil Nil (6) No. of notices of proposal to issue a Certificate of Disrepair served (Form J.) 52 57 25 (7) No. of Certificates of Disrepair issued (Form L) 10 32 5 (8) No. of applications by tenants under consideration at the end of the year (Form I) 6 1 Nil (9) Applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates (Form M) Nil 16 9 (10)Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates Nil 9 1 (11)Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objections Nil 2 Nil (12)Certificates cancelled by Local Authority Nil 13 9 (13)Refusals to cancel Certificates of Disrepair Nil 2 Nil (14)Certificates as to remedying of defects specified in landlord's undertaking (Form P) Nil 19 19 Dealing with applications by tenants and landlords has "brought its problems, but despite the complications involved, it can be said that there have been no serious troubles and, so far, no appeals in which the Council has been concerned. There can be no doubt that a great deal of repair and redecoration of houses has taken place as a result of this Act much of it without recourse to the Council. 38. FOOD INSPECTION. Foodstuffs of all descriptions are constantly under inspection to see that they are fit for human consumption. During the year a variety of foods which were not fit were surrendered by the owners and destroyed by burning or salvaged for animal feeding. The total weight of such goods was :- 13 cwts: 2 qrs: 23 lbs: 3 ozs: There is no slaughterhouse in use in the Borough consequently no meat inspection is carried out except in butchers' shops. Thirty-nine samples of various kinds of food were taken for bacteriological examination as a routine measure to check on fitness for food. FOOD HYGIENE. Forty-four premises are registered under section 16 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved foods intended for sale, and ten premises for the preparation of preserved food intended for sale for human consumption (being the preparation of fish by any process of cooking). Nine-hundred and seventeen visits were made to these premises and to shops, canteens, restaurants, public houses, food handling businesses, and vehicles to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food intended for sale. The following -works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Food & Drugs Act, byelaws and other legislation :- Protection of food from contamination 21 Protective clothing provided for assistants 2 Hot water supply provided for washing 13 Sinks and basins provided 8 Waste pipes repaired or renewed 6 Floors repaired, renewed or cleansed 8 Service pipes and cisterns repaired etc. 1 Internal walls and ceilings repaired 6 Food rooms cleansed 45 Food storage improved 1 Renewal or cleansing of equipment 4 W.Cs. cleansed or repaired 8 W.Cs. lighted or ventilated 1 Additional drains provided 1 Dust receptacles provided 6 Disinfestation of premises 1 Nuisance from animals abated 1 Accumulations removed 3 Name and address displayed on vehicle 2 Miscellaneous 3 39.

FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.). The Analyst's report and details of action taken on contravening samples were as follows:- 2097 (informal) Sardines in Tomato Contained 4.2% of salt which was not declared on the label. Importers agreed to arrange with Portugese packers for words "Salt added" to be printed on the tins. 2104 (informal) Chicken - chopped. Deficient in chicken meat. This was a follow-up of sample No.2072 taken in 1958. Packing takes place in Holland and the importers state the basis of the mixture is a 95% meat content. They think they have traced the reason for the inconsistency of mix and believe the trouble has been overcome. This is still to be confirmed, but the manufacturers agreed to bring into use a new label which would more accurately describe the article. 2130 (informal) Dietetic Orange Squash The wording on the label was not correct in several respects. Correspondence took place with the manufacturers who agreed to. bring into use a new label which would more accurately describe the article. FOOD & DRUGS ACT. 1955. Foreign bodies in food. (i) Mould in Sausage Roll. A resident complained about mould found in a sausage roll which had been purchased at a local public house. The Council decided that legal proceedings be instituted under section 2 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955. The licensee was fined £5. and the Council awarded £2.2.0.costs. (ii) Foreign object in bread. A complaint was received from a local hospital that a member of the staff had found embedded in a slice of wrapped bread a small metal object. The matter was investigated and the manufacturers traced the source of the object and were doing everything they could to see that this did not happen again. The Council decided to send a warning letter to the manufacturers. (iii) Glass in Loaf. A resident complained about a piece of glass found in a loaf purchased at a local shop. The observations of the manufacturers were submitted, and the Council decided that a warning letter be sent to them. (iv)Mould in Sausago Roll. A resident complained about mould found in a sausage roll which he had purchased from a shop in the Borough. The observations of the retailer were submitted. The Council decided that in this case a warning letter be sent to the retailer. 42. FOOD & DRUGS ACT,1955 (Cont.) Foreign bodies in food (cont.) (v) Orange Drink. A complaint was made by a local resident concerning the dirty condition of a bottle of orange drink delivered to her house. The Council decided that legal proceedings be instituted against the person concerned under paragraphs 6 and 32 of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. The retailers were fined £50. and the Council awarded £5.5.0. costs. (vi) Fly in Bread. A local resident purchased a wrapped and sliced loaf of bread in which she found a fly which had been baked in the loaf. The observations of the manufacturers were submitted and the Council decided that a warning be sent to them in this case. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACTS. The parts of these Acts for which the Council is responsible relate to false trade descriptions of articles of food and to the marking of certain imported foodstuffs with an indication of the country of origin. There appears to be a tendency for the requirements of these Acts and the Marking Orders made thereunder to be 'overlooked' necessitating constant reminders to traders of their obligation. Fourteen contraventions were observed during the year and a caution given in each case. MILK SUPPLY. (i) At the end of the year there were forty entries on the register as follows:- Distributors of milk with premises in the Borough 24 Distributors of milk with premises outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 7 (ii) Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 - 1 954. Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 - 1953. Dealers' licences to sell designated milk were granted as follows :- Pasteurised milk 23 " " (supplementary) 9 Tuberculin Tested milk 18 " " (supplementary) 8 Sterilised milk 18 " " (supplementary) 8 43. MILK SUPPLY (Cont.) (iii) Eighty-six samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests :- Turbidity Test T.B.Biological Test Methylene Blue Test Phosphatase Test Pasteurised - - 51 51 T.T. Pasteurised - - 17 17 Sterilised 5 - - - Tuberculin Tested - - 1 - T.T.Raw Milk - 12 - - The phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been properly carried out; the methylene blue test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality; the turbidity test is a check on sterilisation and the T.B. test is for the purpose of detecting tubercle bacilli. The samples for T.B. test were taken at farms in the Borough. All samples conformed to the required standard. A complaint was made by a local resident concerning the dirty condition of a milk bottle delivered to his house. The Council resolved that legal proceedings be instituted against the distributors of the dirty milk bottle under paragraph 27 (l) of the Milk & dairies (General)Regulations, 1959. The distributors were fined £100. and the Council awarded £5.5.0. costs. ICE CREAM. (i) Registration; 186 premises are registered by the Corporation under Section, 16, Pood & Drugs Act, 1955, as under :- For manufacture, storage and sale 4 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to be limited to iced lollies 9 For storage and sale but not manufacture 173 44. ICE CREAM. (Cont.) (ii) Sampling; 81 samples were taken, details being as follows:- Ice Cream. Grade 1 77 Grade 2 Nil 100% Grade 3 Nil Grade 4 Nil 77 Iced Lollies Grade 1 4 100% 81 The Public Health Laboratory Service advises that owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results on any single sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that over a six monthly period, 50% of a vendor's samples should fall into Grade 1, 80% into Grades 1 or 2, not more than 20% into Grade 3, and none into Grade 4. The results above show that a very high standard of hygienic quality is being maintained both by manufacturers and retailers. There are now no manufacturers of ice cream within the Borough. During the year three new regulations with regard to the labelling and composition of ice cream came into force. The effect of these is (briefly) (a) to prohibit the labelling, marking or advertising of ice-cream in a manner suggestive of butter, cream, milk or anything connected with the dairy interest unless it contains no other fat than milk fat (with certain exceptions), (b) to prescribe amended standards of composition for ice-cream of various descriptions, and (c) to amend the conditions relating to the heat treatment of ingredients. 45. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956. The Council gave long and earnest consideration to the provisions of this Act and its complementary orders and regulations, particularly the procedure for making smoke control orders. The Borough is said to "be partly in a so-called ""black area11, "but of course it hears no comparison to the type of district which might he expected to he referred to as ""black" and such an occurrence as a "smoke pall" is unknown. It was therefore felt that the need of such orders in this district was not urgent and that it would he wise to let those districts which had a real smoke problem and where much could he achieved make the first moves and have the benefit of such supplies of smokeless fuels as were available. The supply of smokeless fuels in the Borough during the winter of 1958 -59 was quite inadequate for normal requirements, though it was interesting to find that so many householders had found the desirability of using such fuels. It was in fact the case that many who were anxious to burn those fuels were unable to obtain them in sufficient quantities. The first part of the next winter (up to the end of December 1959) was exceptionally mild and there appeared to be no difficulties over fuels of any kind - indeed the demand was so much below normal that the situation could not be fairly assessed. It would probably bo right to say that better supplies of smokeless fuels were available particularly in view of the fact that several new kinds had come on the market. Whether these supplies would have proved adequate had severe weather occurred is doubtful. The following resolutions of the Public Health Committee were confirmed by the Council:- (i) That this Committee are entirely in sympathy with the object of the Clean Air Act, 1956, to abate the pollution of the air; that in present circumstances, particularly the shortage of smokeless fuels, they do not consider that they are justified in recommending formal action to create smoke control areas within the Borough, but that the matter be kept under review, and the burgesses encouraged voluntarily to adopt the use of smokeless fuels and adapt their existing fireplaces where necessary; (ii) That the Ministry of Housing and Local Government be informed of the decision in (i) above, and asked what action it is proposed to take to improve the present unsatisfactory supplies of smokeless fuel; (iii) That this Committee strongly deprecate the action of the Coal Utilisation Council in so far as public advertisements and literature issued by them encouraged the use of coal in domestic fires, and that a protest be lodged with the Ministry of Housing and Local Government accordingly; 46. CLEAN AIR ACT. 1956. (Cont.). (iv) That the Buildings and Town Planning Committee be recommended to take steps forthwith to make a building byelaw as to the provision of smokeless heating and cooking appliances in new buildings; (The Town Council duly made a byelaw as to the provision of smokeless heating and cooking appliances in new buildings and submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation in accordanco with section 250 of the Local Government Act, 1933). (v) That the Borough Engineer, in consultation with the Chief Public Health Inspector,be asked to report as to the possibility of using smokeless fuels in the various offices and public buildings of the Corporation and as to any additional expenditure which would be necessary in that connection. Subsequently discussions took place between Officers of the Council and the Regional Director of the Ministry of Fuel & Power, and after debate the Council decided to take no action further than the above but to review the matter in the Spring of 1960. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. Thirty-nine licences to station and use moveable dwellings (caravans) were granted during the year. The local Sports Club which holds the lease of tho Riverhill Estate was granted permission to increase the number of caravans from 24 to 36, subject to the additional 12 being taken from offending sites in the Borough or elsewhere in Surrey. This condition was imposed by the County Council under Planning powers in furtherance of its policy to reduce the number of permanent caravan dwellers in the County. All standings on the extended site became occupied during the year. Of the 39 licences issued 36 were in respect of the Riverhill site and 3 for caravans stationed on odd sites throughout the Borough. DUSTBINS. Twenty dustbins were provided, one as a result of statutory notice and nineteen by the service of informal notices. The ambiguity of the Public Health Act which provides that the local authority may require either the owner or occupier of any building to provide a dustbin still gives rise to difficulties necessitating a judicial decision by the Council in all disputed cases. Only one such case had to be decided during the year under review. 47 DISINFECTION. (a) (i) During the year disinfection was carried out free of charge at eleven premises in which the following diseases occurred x- Tuberculosis 6 Scarlet Fever 1 Meningococcal infection 1 Miscellaneous 3 (ii) Disinfection was also carried out at fifteen premises where non-infectious illnesses had occurred on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. (iii) In five cases "bedding was destroyed on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost (non-infectious illness). (b) The total number of articles disinfected "by steam at the Tolworth Hospital, or destroyed was:- Disinfected: Destroyed: Bedspread - 1 Feather beds - 2 Blankets 13 1 Bolsters 1 1 Mattresses 2 10 Mattress covers 19 - Pillows 15 4 Pillow cases 2 - Sheets 5 4 Wearing apparel 23 15 Counterpanes 3 1 Rugs 2 - Towels 1 — Miscellaneous 7 89 46 (c) No. of rooms disinfected 22 No. of library books disinfected 1+4 DISINFESTATION. (a) Bed Bugs. etc. Council Houses Other Houses Found to be infested Disinfested Found to be infested. Disinfested Bugs - - 4 4 Fleas - - 2 2 Lice - - 1 1 Method employed for disinfestation:Spraying with insecticide 7 48. DISINFESTATION (Cont.) (b) School Canteens. At the request of the Surrey County Council thirteen school canteens were sprayed with insecticide to prevent flies and other insect pests, the County Council paying the cost of the work. (c) General. Advice is frequently sought from the Department in the identification and measures for eradication of insect pests of various kinds. For the convenience of the public a small stock of insecticides and sprayers is held in the Department, and these articles are sold at cost price when required. This service seems to be very much appreciated. A large number of requests were received for assistance in dealing with wasps nests. The Council has no obligation in this connection, nor indeed any trained workmen available for the purpose, but advice is given in each individual case and a suitable insecticide supplied at a very low cost. It is nearly always possible to destroy wasps with such materials without risk to the operator if the necessary action is taken at sundown. In difficult cases complainants are referred to a local beekeeper who is willing for a small fee to undertake the task. PUBLIC MORTUARY, During the year 90 bodies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT,1948. 1. One cremation was effected in accordance with Section 50 of the Act where it appeared that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body were being made otherwise than by the Council. 2. It was not necessary to make use of the powers of Section 47 for compulsory removal to suitable promises of sick or aged persons in need of care and attention. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS)ACT,1952. This Act which prohibits the sale, or letting, of certain heating appliances without an effective fireguard, together with Regulations made by the Secretary of State, has been operative since 1954. Nineteen visits were made to premises in the Borough and one warning given where such an appliance Y/as not satisfactory. The offending appliance was withdrawn from sale. 49. SHOPS ACT, 1950. One hundred and forty-six visits were made in the administration of this Act, and two infringements corrected. "Shop" for the purpose of this Act is a very comprehensive term ana includes any premises where any retail trade or business is carried on. The number of such premises in the Borough at the end of 1959s was:- Antique dealers and secondhand furniture 11 Bakers 19 Boots and shoes 32 Builders and Decorators supplies 25 Butchers 35 Cafes and Restaurants 37 Chemists 23 Confectioners,Newsagents and Tobacconists 95 Cycles, Radio and Television 22 Dairies 7 Drapers and Ladies' Outfitters 53 Electrical Supplies 13 Fishmongers and fried fish shops 16 General Stores 16 Greengrocers,Fruiterers and Florists 55 Grocers and Provision Merchants 67 Hairdressers 47 Hardware, Ironmongery and Timber 23 Licensed Premises 51 Motor & Cycle Dealers & Engineers 30 Tailors and Outfitters 16 Upholsterers & House Furnishers 14 Watchmakers and Jewellers 9 Miscellaneous 81 TOTAL:- 797 The present unsatisfactory state of the law with regard to shops is to be deplored. The 1950 Act is merely a consolidation of legislation passed between 1912 and 1938 and is to a large degree outmoded. Further, there have been many decisions given by the Courts which have rendered much of the Act virtually incomprehensible and consequently inoperable. It seems most desirable for the sake of traders, public and local authorities, as well as for Inspectors trying to carry out their duties in a state of confusion, that the situation should be straightened out at an early date. THE PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951. This Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals". Five premises were licensed during the year. Twenty-three inspections were made but no infringements of the licence conditions found. 50. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood continued its grant-aid of 50 per cent of the irrecoverable expenditure incurred by the Council in carrying out its functions under the Prevention of Damage by PestsAct, 1949, up to 31st March, 1959, and in Circular No. I. 3003 dated 9th March, 1959, notified local authorities that under authority of section h, of the Local Government Act, 1958, the grants hitherto payable would cease to be made on expenditure on rodent control incurred after 31st March 1959? from which date the financial responsibility would rest with the Town Council. The Act places upon the occupiers or, in certain circumstances the owners, of land (including buildings) the responsibility for the destruction of rats and mice thereon and for keeping the land free from such pests. It is the duty of the Council to carry out inspections to see that this is done, and to secure so far as practicable that their district is kept free from rats and mice. Where necessary they may serve upon owners or occupiers notices requiring them to take steps for this purpose and penalties are laid down for failure to comply with such notices. The policy of the Council is, however, to give such assistance as is possible to the occupiers of private dwelling houses. For that purpose they permit their own small rodent control staff, who are primarily engaged to deal with Corporation property (including sewers) to give advice and practical help where appropriate, without charge, subject to the signing of the "Request for Treatment" form. The Council is Tinder no legal obligation to do this and does not undertake to provide a service for the destruction of vermin, but does allow its staff to help so far as time permits. Many requests are received and are responded to as quickly as possible, and in the order received as far as practicable, but at timesit is as long as a week before complaints can be dealt with. Every effort is made to give householders the best possible service with the staff available. Fifty schools, business or industrial premises, and two agricultural properties were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year. It seems that the rodent population is being kept down to as low a level as is likely to be achieved until new techniques are evolved and perhaps new poisons introduced.
