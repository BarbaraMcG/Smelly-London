TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE POET OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith my Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London. The tonnage of vessels entering the Port of London during 1931 was 27,989,066 tons, being 1,243,848 tons less than during the previous year. Of the 15,187 vessels arriving from foreign ports, 1,835 vessels were boarded and inspected by your Medical Officers. Two hundred and twenty-eight vessels arrived on which there were or had occurred during the voyage a total of 957 cases of infectious sickness. This total included 21 cases of Mumps and 477 cases of Influenza. The remaining 458 were cases of infectious diseases notifiable in the Port Sanitary District. Of these 162 were actually landed in the Port, 22 being removed to your Hospital at Denton, the remainder being sent to other hospitals or being allowed to proceed home. 21 cases of Mumps were also treated in your Hospital and 6 cases were taken in for observation, but proved to be non-infectious. The Training Ships were free from infectious sickness except for three cases of Diphtheria on the "Exmouth" and one on the "Stork" Seven cases of Diphtheria occurred amongst persons resident in the Port Sanitary District and 2 cases of Scarlet Fever on a houseboat in Leigh Creek. No case of Plague arrived and no Plague-infected rats were found on ships or on shore in the Port. One thousand three hundred and forty-four rats from ships and 2,796 rats from shore premises were bactenologically examined, but in no case was there any suspicion of Plague infection. One vessel arrived on which there had occurred a case of Cholera and five vessels arrived from which a total of 14 cases of Small-pox had been landed abroad. The number of notices served in accordance with the Parrots (Prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930, was 106 in respect of 127 parrots, &c., and 145 parrots were admitted under special Ministry of Health permit. Your Sanitary Inspectors made 15,066 inspections of vessels and 5,434 inspections of shore premises. Orders to cleanse crew quarters were made on 1,779 vessels and it was found necessary to call for structural alterations and repairs on 379 vessels. Orders to remedy structural defects were made in respect of 62 premises. Twenty-two Statutory Notices were issued in respect of nuisance from smoke, 18 in respect of vessels and 4 of premises ashore. The number of certificates issued under the Public Health (Deratisation of Ships) Regulations, 1929, was 1,055; 171 Certificates of Deratisation and 884 Certificates of Exemption from Deratisation. The number of vessels fumigated for rat destruction under the supervision of your Inspectors was 165, 101 by Sulphur Dioxide and 64 by Hydrogen Cyanide. By the former method 1,164 rats and by the latter 968 rats were destroyed. In addition 3,072 rats were trapped on ships and 5,783 rats on shore in the Port. All the figures in regard to rat destruction are a little less than last year, but this is probably due to the decrease in the tonnage of ships entering the Port. 10 One infringement of the Bye-laws relating to offensive cargoes was reported. An Intimation Notice was sent to the offender, who took such steps as to render further action unnecessary. The arrangements made with the Port of London Authority whereby the annual re-registration of Water Barges was made conditional upon the satisfactory report from your officers as to fitness of the barges for carrying drinking water, worked smoothly and efficiently during the year. On April 23rd your new Boarding Launch was delivered at Gravesend and the naming ceremony was carried out by Lady Green at Tilbury Landing Stage on April 25th, the vessel being called the "Howard Deighton." New arrangements have been made for the boarding of ships by your Medical Officers at Gravesend. These are described in detail on page 14. The new scheme has worked satisfactorily and the policy of building a special Boarding Launch adopted by your Committee in 1930 has been fully justified, it being now possible for Medical Officers to carry out more thorough inspections without delay to ships or to H.M. Customs and for cases of infectious disease to be removed to your Hospital more promptly and in greater comfort and safety. Improvements at Denton Hospital include the raising of the Causeway so that the new launch can come alongside more easily, the erection of a chain-link fence enclosing a section of the grounds around the Small-pox Ward Block and the renewal of the flooring of the Scarlet Fever Wards. A scheme for the improvement of the hospital garden by raising the general level of the ground was considered, but was postponed on account of the difficulty and expense of getting suitable material tipped on the site. Meanwhile as much of the scheme as possible is being carried out by your own Staff. The inspection of imported foodstuffs is an important part of your work and during the year 1,408 tons of foodstuffs were condemned as unfit for human consumption and were either destroyed or disposed of for industrial purposes. The control of imported mutton on account of Caseous Lymphadenitis was continued throughout the year, but it was found possible to reduce the examination of carcases from Australia and New Zealand from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent. by reason of the improved standard of inspection at the time of slaughter in these two countries. The standard of examination in South America was not so uniformly good and consequently the proportion of carcases examined remained at 10 per cent. Mutton imported as pieces was subjected to 100 per cent. examination regardless of the country of origin. In order that there shall be uniformity in the principal ports, the extent of examination of imported mutton is determined by the Ministry of Health after either a conference of Medical Officers of Health concerned or consideration of returns of the results of examinations over a period of six months. Again an expression of thanks is due to the Medical Officers of Health of the City of London and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Bermondsey, Southwark, Finsbury and Greenwich for undertaking the examination of all imported mutton consigned to cold stores in their districts. Without this assistance it would be impossible for the work of inspection to be carried out without serious congestion in the dock stores and interference with the prompt delivery of supplies. As in former years a percentage of all ox-tongues imported from South America was examined on arrival, the proportion found to be affected with Actinobacillosis being 1.1 per cent. This figure is higher than that for the previous two years, but the proportion of tongues examined was increased in the case of consignments from sources where conditions were unsatisfactory and this led to a marked improvement in the latter part of the year. Legal proceedings were not taken in regard to any foodstuffs as merchants voluntarily surrendered everything found to be unsound or unfit for human consumption, and there was no instance of any deliberate attempt to import food in contravention of any of the Public Health Regulations. 11 The Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations is appended. I have pleasure in reporting that all grades of your Staff carried out their duties in a highly satisfactory manner. Dr. Cadman resigned on December 31st to take up an appointment in the City and Port of Hull. Mr. Garland and Mr. Rolfe, Pood Inspectors, Mr. Jarvis, Master of the "Joseph White," and Mr. Steen, Supervisory Engineer, retired on pension, all, unfortunately, on account of ill-health. The health work of so large a port could not be carried out by a comparatively small Staff without the co-operation of the Officers of His Majesty's Customs, the Port of London Authority, the Pilots and the members of the Staffs of the Shipping Companies and Merchants, and their assistance and courtesy is gratefully acknowledged. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES F. WHITE. 12 1.-AMOUNT OF SHIPPING ENTERING THE PORT DURING THE YEAR 1931. Table A. Number. Tonnage.

Inasmuch as the Port of London from West to East extends for a distance of nearly 69 miles and passes through the following Counties:— On the North Bank, Middlesex, London and Essex, On the South Bank, Surrey, London and Kent, it necessarily follows that there are various sources of water supply. The warehouses and offices in the docks, all of which are within the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, are supplied direct from mains. Shipping in the docks is chiefly supplied with water from the mains ashore. 18 In some cases, however, for instance where vessels are not lying near a dock quay, water is supplied from water barges. Vessels lying in the River obtain their supplies direct from water mains on shore or from water barges. A complaint made on board the s.s. "-" in regard to the fresh water taken in at North Shields was investigated. In appearance the water was discoloured, but a sample sent to your Analyst was favourably reported upon. The tanks were, however, emptied and cleansed and refilled with London water. The Medical Officer for the Tyne Port Sanitary District was notified of the complaint and the source of the water. In view of the fact that several cases of gastro-intestinal disturbances had occurred on board the ss. "-"from Jacksonville, the drinking water, which had been taken on board at New Brunswick, was analysed. The Analyst's report was favourable, but the tanks were, nevertheless, pumped out, cleansed and refilled with London water. Water Barges.—As the majority of vessels obtain their water direct from hydrants on shore, water barges are not numerous in the Port of London. At the beginning of the year there were 16 in commission, and at the end of the year 15 only. These water barges are filled with pure water from the mains. It is, therefore, only necessary to ensure that no contamination of the water takes place during the filling of the tanks or while stored in the barges. This object is best achieved by a thorough inspection of the barges when empty, special attention being paid to the interior of the tanks and to the hoses and equipment. The water barges must be registered annually with the Port of London Authority, and before re-registration they must be inspected as to their fitness for navigation on the River and in the docks. The arrangement made whereby the Port of London Authority agreed to co-operate with the Port Sanitary Authority by informing them when each water barge was due for their annual inspection, and by making re-registration conditional, not only on the fitness of the barge for navigation, but also upon a favourable report from the Port Sanitary Authority as to the fitness of the barge for the carriage of drinking water, has worked smoothly and well. The Port of London Authority cancelled the registration of one barge during the year. IV.—INFECTIOUS DISEASE. For the prevention of the importation of infectious disease it is necessary to arrange for the medical inspection of vessels:— (1) Proceeding up the River Thames. (2) Proceeding up the River Medway. Vessels proceeding up the Thames—The Port Sanitary Authority maintain a hulk, the "Hygeia," moored in the River, off Gravesend, about 26 miles below London Bridge, on which there is a Medical Officer on duty night and day. In the past the Medical Officer has boarded vessels from the steam launch of His Majesty's Customs but, as reported last year, the Port Sanitary Authority decided to build their own Boarding Launch. This vessel was delivered at Gravesend on April 23rd, and on April 25th she was named the "Howard Deighton" the ceremony being performed by Lady Green at Tilbury Landing Stage. The launch is steel built with a length of 75 feet overall, a breadth of 14 feet 6 inches, a moulded depth of 7 feet 6 inches and a maximum draft of 6 feet 6 inches. She has twin screws driven by two Diesel Engines each 96 b.h.p., and a speed of 11 to 12 knots. On deck there is an ambulance room fitted internally like an ordinary motor ambulance, so that four stretcher cases or eight sitting cases can be carried. Forward there is sleeping accommodation for a crew of four; aft there is a cabin for the Medical Officer. 14 As soon as this launch was put in full commission a new scheme of boarding arrangements was introduced, and thanks are due to the Elder Brethren of Trinity House and the Pilots, to His Majesty's Customs, to the Port of London Authority and to the Wireless Department of His Majesty's Post Office for their courtesy and assistance. The present arrangements are as follows:— The Sea Pilots have undertaken that immediately a Pilot boards an inwardbound ship he will hand to the Master a copy of the following form— PORT OP LONDON SANITARY AUTHORITY. Port Sanitary Authorities (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1920. TO THE MASTER OF THE SHIP*. 1. Is there now, or has there been during the voyage, on board your vessel— (a) Any case of Infectious Sickness or of Illness as to the nature of which you are in doubt? Answer:—Yes † No t† (b) Any death from sickness which has not been certified by a doctor to be non-infectious? Answer:—Yes † No † (c) Any sickness or mortality amongst Eats? Answer:—Yes †No † 2. Have you sailed from or during the voyage called at any of the following Ports ?:— Ports in ASIA including JAPAN, the EAST INDIES and CEYLON, AFRICA including MADAGASCAR, the CANARY ISLANDS and CAPE VERDE ISLANDS, TURKEY, GREECE, BLACK SEA, AZORES, SOUTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA, GULF OF MEXICO, WEST INDIES? Answer:—Yes † No † Signature of Master. If the answer to any of the above questions is "Yes" you should— (1) send forthwith a wireless message to Hygeia, Gravesend, giving the name of your vessel and the time she is expected to arrive off Gravesend; § (2) by day, when within the limits of the Port of London, hoist the flag group "LIM," meaning "Port Medical Officer required"; by night, when approaching Gravesend, flash letter "Q" from your Morse lamp; (3) be prepared to muster your crew for inspection by the Port Medical Officer. CHAS. F. WHITE, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. * Insert name of ship. †Strike out whichever does not apply. § Name of ship as one word; time on 24 hour clock. This Form to be kept on board till demanded by an Officer of the Port Sanitary Authority. Pilots do not accept any obligation or responsibility, but have offered their assistance and realise that compliance, on the part of the masters, with the instructions in regard to messages and signals will expedite the clearing of vessels at Gravesend. The wireless messages are received by the North Foreland Radio Station and are transmitted by telephone direct to the "Hygeia." Post Office charges for these messages are paid by the shipowners. 15 The scheme has worked very satisfactorily, but several improvements could be effected in the Form of Declaration of Health. The instructions should be put before the questions, as masters frequently do not read the part of the form below the point where they have to sign it. Question 1 (a) would be better divided into two questions, as it has been taken to mean "have you any cases of infectious sickness as to the nature of which you are in doubt?" with the result that answer " No " has been given when there have been on board cases of the less serious infectious diseases which have been diagnosed with complete confidence by the ship's surgeon or the master. The list of scheduled ports is large, but it is impossible to notify frequent changes in the list to Pilots, and so long as every effort is made to avoid unnecessary delay to healthy ships, no difficulty arises. The instructions should be modified to provide for the repeated flashing of letter "Q" from the Morse lamp at night. The Medical Officers usually go off to those vessels only which report in accordance with the above instructions. The wireless messages give several hours' notice of the time at which a vessel is expected, and the launch is therefore available for the Sanitary Inspector on the LoAver River District to visit vessels lying at Wharves, so long as he returns to "Hygeia" before the notified time of arrival of the next ship requiring to be dealt with by the Medical Officer. When the launch leaves her moorings without the Medical Officer on board, the Preventive Officer of His Majesty's Customs is informed either verbally or by hoisting pennant "C" on the "Hygeia," then, if a vessel requiring medical inspection arrives unexpectedly, the Customs launch takes the Medical Officer off to board her. The Customs Officers hail all incoming ships and if they discover a ship which requires to be cleared by the Medical Officer but which has failed to report, they instruct the Master to hoist the flag signal "LIM" by day, and flash the light signal "Q" at night, and to blow "Q" on the siren. Pratique can only by granted by His Majesty's Customs, therefore, if a Medical Officer clears a ship before the Customs arrive, he leaves with the Master a copy of the following form:— PORT OP LONDON SANITARY AUTHORITY. To the Preventive Officer, His Majesty's Customs. This is to certify that I have examined the and that I find no medical reasons for withholding pratique. Signed Boarding Medical Officer. Date The Preventive Officers are requested to detain ships from the scheduled ports until they have been medically inspected, but in practice the Customs Officers and the Medical Officers are in close touch, and formal detention is rarely necessary. Moreover, if, by reason of the state of the tide, time is important to the ship, she is allowed to proceed slowly up river while the Medical Officer completes his inspection, the launch following ready to take the doctor off as soon as he has finished. The "Howard Deighton" is on duty night and day, there being three crews, each having a watch of 24 hours, followed by 48 hours off duty, but, during holiday periods and in case of illness, reliefs for the men of one crew who are away must be provided by the other two crews. Also when special work is necessary on any of the Port Sanitary Authority's launches, additional men must be supplied by one of the crews off duty. 16 Between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. the boarding launch is regularly engaged in taking either the Medical Officer or the Sanitary Inspector to ships, but during the night she is only required for the medical inspection of incoming vessels. Thus the members of the crew are usually able to get a reasonable amount of rest during their 24 hours watch, and also have time to carry out running repairs and generally keep the launch in good order. The success of this scheme for the medical inspection of vessels entering the Port of London depends on the willing and intelligent co-operation of Masters, Pilots, Customs Officers, Medical Officers and Launch Crews, and it is gratifying to be able to report that remarkably few difficulties have arisen and that, though Medical Officers have had time for a more thorough examination of the vessels they have boarded, no serious delay has been occasioned to any ship. Cases of infectious disease are removed in the Port Sanitary Authority's motor launch to the Authority's Isolation Hospital which is situated on the River bank at Denton, just below Gravesend. This Hospital consists of an administrative block, three ward blocks providing accommodation for 32 cases, a bathing and disinfecting station, laundry, mortuary and post-mortem room, and a porter's cottage. When it is deemed necessary for the prevention of the spread of infection, contacts are removed to hospital for observation, or more commonly for bathing and disinfection of their personal effects. The bathing station consists of an undressing room connected with the infected side of the disinfector, four spray and two slipper baths and a dressing room connected with the clean side of the disinfector. The whole building can be kept thoroughly warm, so that contacts who have been through the baths can wait, without discomfort, to receive their disinfected clothing. A causeway runs from the Hospital down to the Eiver, and during the year this has been raised in order to enable the new launch to go alongside for the landing of patients. When vessels arrive on which dangerous infectious disease has occurred, and the period that has elapsed since the landing of the last case is less than the maximum incubation period of the disease in question, not only are passengers and crew carefully inspected, but their names and addresses are obtained and forwarded with the necessary information to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts to which they are proceeding. The addresses are carefully checked by the Medical Officer by personal interrogation of each passenger and member of the crew, as passenger manifests and crew articles are not sufficiently accurate. Those who are liable to change their addresses within the prescribed period of surveillance are given postcards addressed to the Port Medical Officer of Health, and told that they must notify promptly thereon any change of address. If time permits, infected quarters are put under disinfection by the Sanitary Inspector, who removes the case in the Eiver, otherwise they are sealed and disinfected by the Sanitary Inspector, who visits the vessel when she arrives at her berth. The usual method of disinfection of quarters is spraying with Izal solution, followed by fumigation with Sulphur Dioxide. Infected bedding, clothing, &c., is removed by launch for disinfection at the Isolation Hospital. Vessels proceeding up the Eiver Medway are dealt with by a part-time Medical Officer from Sheerness, whose duty is to visit, as soon as possible, every vessel on which sickness is reported by His Majesty's Customs, and to board within about 12 hours of arrival every other vessel from " foreign " remaining within the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. Cases of infectious disease from such vessels would be removed to the Port Sanitary Authority's Hospital at Denton. The cleansing of persons can now be carried out efficiently and promptly at the bathing and disinfecting station at the Authority's Hospital. 17 The ml. "Howard Deighton" is available for the transport of cases of infectious disease within the Port. The Boarding Medical Officers always make enquiries in regard to the occurrence of Venereal disease on vessels they board, and give advice as to when and where treatment is obtainable. Handbills showing where free treatment can be obtained by seamen suffering from Venereal disease are distributed on vessels. The Port Sanitary Authority do not provide a clinic, but there are clinics at Sheerness, Rochester, Southend, Gravesend, Faversbam, Dartford, Royal Albert and Victoria Dock, Greenwich and London. Bacteriological examination of rats is carried out at the laboratories of the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, under the direction of Professor Hewlett. These laboratories are equipped with every modern appliance, and, if Plague is suspected, rats can be examined at any time of the day. Other bacteriological examinations are now also carried out at the above laboratories. INTERNATIONAL SANITARY CONVENTION, 1926. Ship-borne Infections. When a vessel is found, on arrival in a port in the United Kingdom, to be an "infected" or "suspected" ship, and subsequently proceeds to another United Kingdom port, it is the practice of the Medical Officer of Health of the first port to notify to the Medical Officer of Health of the second port, particulars of the circumstances and of the sanitary measures which have been applied. The Minister of Health, in Circular 1,171, expressed the opinion that such an interchange of information between ports in this country and foreign ports would be in accordance with the spirit of the International Sanitary Convention, and suggested that the Port Sanitary Authority should instruct their Medical Officer of Health that, when the next port of call of a vessel, which is an infected or suspected ship, or has a case of Small-pox or Typhus on board, lies between Brest and the River Elbe, he should communicate directly with the Medical Officer of Health of such port, sending a copy of his message to the Ministry. If the next port of call is beyond the Brest— River Elbe area, the communication should be sent direct to the Ministry, who would take any necessary further action. Messages should be sent in time to arrive at the next port of call before the vessel, and may therefore be sent by letter or telegram, as is necessary. In the Circular were given specimen messages and also the official designations and addresses of the Medical Officers of Health of the principal ports between Brest and the River Elbe. This suggestion was adopted by the Port of London Sanitary Authority, and during the year messages were sent to:— Medical Officer of Health, Dundee, in respect of Small-pox on board ss. " Matheran." Medical Officer of Health, Dundee, in respect of Small-pox on board ss. " Matra." Medical Officer of Health, Rotterdam, in respect of Chicken-pox and Small-pox on board ss. "Clan MacTaggart." Medical Officer of Health, Rotterdam, in respect of Chicken-pox and Small-pox on board ss. "Clan Buchanan." Medical Officer of Health, Dundee, in respect of Small-pox on board ss. "City of Hong Kong." 18 Table C. Cases of Infectious Sickness landed from Vessels. Disease. Number of Cases during 1931. Passengers. Crew. Average Number of Cases for previous 5 years.

The ss. "Malancha" arrived at Gravesend on 11/4/31, having left Calcutta on 6/8/31. On 11/3/31 a native Greaser was taken ill. He was isolated in the ship's hospital, and on 12/3/31 was landed to hospital at Colombo, where the diagnosis of Cholera was confirmed bacteriologically. The vessel was quarantined at Colombo from 12/3/31 to 16/3/31, where the water tanks were emptied, cleansed and refilled and the infected quarters and hospital were disinfected. No other case occurred. Small-pox. ss. "Matheran."—On 30th January the Ministry of Health forwarded a copy of a telegram from the Quarantine Board of Egypt to the effect that the ss. "Matheran" 19 had landed a case of Small-pox at Suez. The vessel arrived off Gravesend at 10.30 p.m., on 8th February, and was boarded by Dr. Cadman, who carried out a very thorough inspection and found no secondary cases. Movements of Vessel.—Calcutta 7/1/81. Colombo 13/1/31. Suez 25/1/31. Port Said 26/1/31. Oran 2/2/31. Number of Persons on Board.—Passengers, nil. Crew: 17 Europeans, 77 natives. (No surgeon on board.) History of Case.—The patient was a Lascar—Jacoob Allee—aged 26. On 22/1/31, i.e., 15 days after leaving Calcutta, this man reported sick with a rash on his face. The Captain reported that the man then had spots on his face and scalp, a few on the left side of the chest, a few on the shoulder blades, none on the abdomen, none on the upper limbs, a few on the front and backs of the thighs and none on the legs. There were no temperature and no predomal symptoms, and the man worked right up to the day of appearance of the rash. The Captain suspected Small-pox and isolated the man forthwith. The vessel reached Suez three days later, where the Medical Officer diagnosed the case as suspected Small-pox and had him removed to hospital ashore. At Suez all members of the crew were vaccinated except those who could show evidence of recent successful vaccination. The crew's quarters were disinfected with Formalin and their bedding and effects taken ashore for steam disinfection. Action on Arrival in London.—The crew were mustered and their names and addresses were taken. They were carefully inspected for any evidence of Small-pox, but nothing suspicious was discovered. Their vaccination marks were inspected and the date of the last successful vaccination recorded, from which it appeared that all should be adequately protected. The vessel proceeded to Tilbury Dock and sailed for Dundee on the 10th January. The crew remained on board except for the Fourth Engineer, who proceeded on leave to Liverpool. The Medical Officer of Health of Liverpool was informed of the name and address of this contact, and the Medical Officer of Health of Dundee was sent a copy of this Report. No further case occurred. ss. "Matra."—The ss. "Matra" arrived off Gravesend at noon on 22/2/31, and was boarded by Dr. Hugh Willoughby, who ascertained that three cases of Small-pox had occurred on board during the homeward voyage. Movements of Vessel.—Calcutta 19/1/31. Coconada 22/1/31. Madras 25/1/31. Colombo 28/1/31. Aden 4/2/31. Suez 9/2/31. Port Said 10/2/31. Number of Persons on Board.—Passengers, two. Crew: 17 Europeans, 74 natives. (No surgeon on board.) History of Cases.—1st Case: A Lascar, aged 21, reported sick on 21/1/31, two days out from Calcutta, with an eruption on the face, chest and back. He was immediately isolated in the ship's hospital. The next day the ship arrived at Coconada, where the case was diagnosed as Small-pox, but was left on board to proceed to Madras. The native crew were all vaccinated, as were also the only two members of the European crew who could not show signs of recent successful vaccination No disinfection was carried out. 20 2nd Case: On 25/1/31 the ship arrived at Madras, where the Port Medical Officer confirmed the diagnosis in the first case and discovered a second case, a native fireman, aged 23, during his inspection of the crew. Both cases were removed to hospital ashore. Seven more Europeans were vaccinated at their own request. The native crew's bedding was removed and fumigated ashore, and their quarters and the hospital were disinfected. Later, the diagnosis of Small-pox was revised and the Master was informed that both were cases of Chicken-pox. 3rd Case: On 29/1/31 another native fireman reported sick with an eruption on his face, arms and legs, and was isolated on board. When the ship arrived at Aden on 4/2/31 this case was diagnosed as Small-pox, and the patient was removed to hospital ashore and the ship's hospital was again disinfected. Action on Arrival in London.— All on board were closely inspected and their condition as to vaccination recorded. No further cases were found and everyone appeared to be protected by vaccination. The hospital and the native quarters were sprayed with Izal solution and fumigated with sulphur. The personal effects of the natives were spread out and exposed to the spray and fumigant. The name and address of a passenger contact was notified to the Medical Officer of Health of his home district. The crew remained on board and the ship sailed for Dundee on 24/2/31, the Medical Officer of that port being informed of the circumstances. These cases were not infected on board, but on shore, before joining. They may have been infected from different sources, and it is therefore possible that the first two cases were Chicken-pox and the third Small-pox, modified by vaccination. The Master of the ss. "Matra" appeared to have handled the situation particularly well throughout the voyage. No further case occurred. ss. "Clan MacTaggart."—On 12th February the Ministry of Health forwarded a copy of a telegram from the Quarantine Board of Egypt to the effect that two cases of Small-pox had been landed at Suez from the ss. "Clan MacTaggart," on 9th February. The ship arrived at Gravesend at 3.30 p.m., on 23/2/31, and was boarded by Dr. Cadman, who ascertained that during the homeward voyage, four cases diagnosed as Chicken-pox and three diagnosed as Small-pox had occurred. Movements of Vessel.— Calcutta 4/1/31. Chittagong 10/1/31. Bimlipatam 12/1/31. Coconada 18/1/31. Madras 23/1/31. Colombo 28/1/31. Tuticorin 28/1/31. Suez 9/2/31. Algiers 16/2/31. Number of Persons on Board.— Passengers, nil. Crew : 14 Europeans, 79 natives. (No surgeon on board.) History of Cases.—1st Case: On 15/1/31, 11 days out from Calcutta and while the vessel was lying at Coconada, a native greaser reported sick with an eruption and was isolated in the ship's hospital. 2nd, 3rd and 4th Cases.— The next day three more natives of the engine room department were found to have a similar eruption and were placed in hospital on board. On 23/1/31 the ship arrived at Madras and the cases were seen by the Port Medical Officer, who diagnosed Chicken-pox and removed them to hospital ashore. He vaccinated the immediate contacts. These four men rejoined the ship at Tuticorin on 28/1/31. 21 5th and 6th Cases.— On 31/1/31, 16 days after the occurrence of the first case, another native fireman and the native donkeyman Avere taken ill and isolated in the ship's hospital. On 9/2/31 these two cases Avere seen by the Port Medical Officer at Suez, who diagnosed Small-pox and removed them to hospital ashore. The Avhole ship's company Avere vaccinated and the creAv's quarters and hospital Avere disinfected. 7th Case.—On 15/2/31, 16 days after the occurrence of the second group of cases, a native trimmer was taken ill and Avas landed to hospital at Algiers as a case of Small-pox. Action on Arrival in London.—All on board were carefully examined and their condition as regards vaccination recorded. The four original cases Avere inspected and the distribution of the scars of the eruption appeared to confirm the diagnosis of Chicken-pox made at Madras. As vaccination had been carried out at Suez and disinfection at Suez and Algiers, no further measures of this nature Avere taken. The creAv remained on board with the exception of tAvo, whose names £ind addresses Avere duly notified to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts to Avhich they proceeded. The rest of the crew were medically inspected daily Avhile the vessel remained in the Port of London, but no further case developed. She sailed for Rotterdam on 2/8/31, and the Medical Officer of Health of that port was advised of all the circumstances by letter. It appears probable that the first four cases were infected before joining the ship, that the fifth and sixth cases Avere infected from the first four, and the seventh from the fifth and sixth. If so, then all the cases Avere of the same nature. The account of the disease given by the Master and the inspection of the men who had rejoined the ship suggest that the cases Avere all Chicken-pox. ss. "Clan Buchanan."— A letter Avas received from the Ministry of Health on 25/2/31, enclosing a copy of a telegram from the Quarantine Board of Egypt, to the effect that the ss. "Clan Buchanan" had landed tAvo cases of Small-pox at Suez on 23/2/31. The vessel arrived off Gravesend at 8.5 p.m., on 10/3/31. Movements of Vessel.—Chittagong 25/1/31. Yizagapatam 31/1/31. Madras 4/2/31. Galle 8/2/31. Colombo 9/2/31. Tuticorin 11/2/31. Suez 23/2/31. Port Said 24/2/31. Algiers 3/3/31. Number of Persons on Board.— Passengers, nil. Crew : 14 Europeans, 57 natives. (No surgeon on board.) History of Cases.—1st Case : On arrival of the vessel at Colombo, on 9/2/31, a Lascar Avas discovered to have a rash. He Avas seen by a doctor, Avho diagnosed Varicella and sent him to hospital ashore. The infected quarters Avere Avashed doAvn Avith a carbolic solution. 2nd and 3rd Cases : On 17/2/31 tAvo more natives, a fireman and the donkeyman, were found to have an eruption on the face and trunk, a few spots being present on the legs, but none on the arms. They had a slight rise of temperature, but no other constitutional symptoms. Both Avere isolated on board until the ship's arrival at Suez, on 23/2/31, when they Avere examined by the Port Medical Officer of Health, who told the Captain that they were probably suffering from Chicken-pox, but Avould be taken to hospital for observation. The infected quarters Avere disinfected by spraying Avith a disinfectant solution. Action on Arrival in London.— All on board Avere closely inspected and their vaccinal state recorded. During this inspection Dr. Cadman discovered a "missed case," a native fireman Avho presented the scars and a few remaining crusts of the eruption of Chicken-pox. It appears that this case belonged to the second group, 22 but having had no rash on his face, he had escaped detection previously. He was removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital, Denton, for bathing and disinfection, and was returned to the ship three days later. The crew were kept under daily observation while the ship was in dock, and on 18/3/81 a Lascar developed typical Chicken-pox. He was removed to Denton Hospital. The crew's quarters were fumigated with Sulphur Dioxide and sprayed with Izal solution. On 14/3/31 the ship sailed for Rotterdam, the Medical Officer of Health of that port being notified of the circumstances by letter. Observations.— The crew joined the ship at Chittagong, having been sent thither from Calcutta. It appears that the first case was infected before joining the ship. It is probable that he had the eruption about a week before he was diagnosed, and that he infected the two cases landed at Suez and the convalescent one discovered on arrival in London. The case which developed while the ship was in Tilbury Dock was infected by the " missed" case. ss. " City of Hong Kong."—A letter was received from the Ministry of Health on 25th March, enclosing a copy of a telegram from the Quarantine Board, Alexandria, to the effect that the ss. " City of Hong Kong " had landed four cases of Small-pox at Suez on 21st March. The vessel arrived off Gravesend on 4th April, 1931, and was boarded by Dr. Cadman. Movements of Vessel.— Arrived.

Crew : 33 European, 115 natives. (Surgeon on board.) History of Cases.— 1st Case: The vessel left Calcutta on 2/3/31, and on 6/3/31 a Lascar, Bussore Ali, was observed, during the daily muster by the Surgeon, to have a "pustular" eruption. The doctor stripped the man in hospital and made a diagnosis of Small-pox. This diagnosis was confirmed by the Health Authorities ashore at Madras, and the patient was removed to hospital. The patient's bunk was washed down with a carbolic solution, but no other disinfection was carried out. The patient's effects were taken ashore with him. 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Cases: The Medical Officer at Colombo, at which port the vessel arrived on 9/3/31, passed the ship, but on 20/3/31, while at sea, the Surgeon detected four fresh cases during his daily routine inspection. These patients, all natives, were immediately isolated in the ship's hospital with their effects, and their bunks were washed down. The Surgeon commenced vaccination of the crew. On arrival at Suez, 21/3/31, the patients, with their effects, were taken to hospital ashore and their quarters disinfected by the Port Health Authorities. Here the vaccination of the crew was completed, and the Surgeon subsequently vaccinated as many passengers as would submit to the operation. 6th Case: On 24/3/31 another Lascar developed the eruption and was at once placed in hospital on board. On 26/3/31 the patient was seen by the Medical Officer at Malta and removed, with his effects, to hospital ashore as a case of Small-pox. Here the crew's quarters were again sprayed with a disinfectant. 23 Action taken in London.-— The vessel arrived off Gravesend at 3.30 a.m. on 4/4/31, and was boarded by Dr. Cadman, who obtained a history of the cases from the ship's Surgeon and then proceeded to a careful inspection of the crew, but did not find any fresh cases nor any "missed" cases. Later, Dr. Cadman was joined by Dr. Warrack, who examined all the passengers. Two Sanitary Inspectors and a rat-searcher boarded the vessel, disinfected the infected quarters and gave general assistance. I also attended personally with two clerks, who proceeded immediately to send off names and addresses of passengers and European crew to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts of destination. All names and addresses were carefully checked with the individual passengers and members of crew, and the vaccinal state of all on board was recorded on the crew and passenger lists. The native sailors were all sent ashore to Denton Hospital, where they were bathed and their clothing and effects disinfected by steam. Meanwhile their quarters were sprayed with Izal and subsequently put under fumigation with S02. The passengers were allowed to land at 10 a.m., and the native crew returned to the ship about 11.30 a.m. The vessel docked in the afternoon, and the Marine Superintendent expressed appreciation of the expedition with which the vessel had been cleared. The names and addresses were all posted to Medical Officers of Health of districts of destination the same afternoon in London, the envelopes being marked " urgent." Subsequent History of Ship.— Dr. Warrack visited the ship daily in dock and inspected the crew. On 6th April he discovered two native seamen who had developed the eruption of Chicken-pox. These were removed to Denton Hospital forthwith, where I saw them and agreed with the diagnosis. On 8th. April Dr. Warrack found two native firemen who had developed the eruption of Chicken-pox on the previous evening. These were also removed to Denton Hospital. One of them had well-marked scars of an old attack of Small-pox. These four cases were seen on 8th April by Dr. W. V. Shaw, of the Ministry of Health, who confirmed the diagnosis of Chicken-pox. The ship sailed for Dundee at 3 p.m., on 8th April, the Port Medical Officer of Health of Dundee being informed by letter of the circumstances. The Shipping Company were advised to put the native crew on a ship lying up until the epidemic had settled down, as more cases might occur and lead to trouble abroad. ss. "Clan MacBrayne."— The above vessel arrived at Gravesend on 7th April, from Bombay. A native fireman reported sick on 16th February, while the vessel was at Cochin. He was seen by a doctor at Cochin, who sent the patient to the Government Isolation Hospital as a case of Small-pox. The whole of the infected quarters and the native's effects were disinfected at Cochin, and the whole of the native crew were re-vaccinated at Allepy on 18th February. On arrival at Gravesend the crew were carefully examined and their vaccinal condition noted. No further case was discovered. Y.—MEASURES AGAINST RODENTS. (1) Steps taken for the detection of rodent Plague:— The Port Sanitary Authority employs six Assistant Rat Officers. Each Assistant Rat Officer has his own district, corresponding to the district of a Sanitary Inspector, under whose guidance he works. An Assistant Rat Officer's first duty is the examination of such ships in his district as are due for inspection under Article 28 of the International Sanitary Convention relative to the granting of Deratisation and Deratisation Exemption Certificates. His second duty is to visit ships arriving in his district from Plague-infected ports, to search for dead rats and, 24 if possible, to obtain specimens of live rats trapped on board. He is required to re-visit such vessels daily during the discharge of cargo, to ascertain whether dead rats have been found in the holds. The existence of rodent Plague on board any vessel in the Port should thus be detected at the earliest possible moment. The Assistant Eat Officer's third duty is the examination of shore premises for signs of rat infestation or rat Plague, paying particular attention to premises adjoining the berths of vessels from Plague-infected ports. The whole of the Dock area is systematically and regularly inspected, and specimens of the shore rat population in all parts of the Port are regularly examined bacteriologically, so that, in the rare event of Plague infection being communicated to the rats on shore, it should be quickly detected and stamped out before it has spread extensively. Moreover, when rat-infestation of premises is reported, the responsible persons are required to take energetic measures of rat-destruction, for rat Plague will spread rapidly in a rat-infested area, whereas where rats are few it may never spread at all. It is of the greatest importance, not only from the public health, but also from the commercial point of view, that the Port of London should be kept free from rat Plague. Bacteriological Examination of Rats.— The bacteriological examination of rats for plague is carried out in the laboratories of the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, where there is a Staff of skilled bacteriologists under the direction of Professor Hewlett. Assistant Rat Officers collect rats from ships and shore premises in their district each day. They tie to one leg of each rat a small label, on which is a letter combination indicating the Dock where the rat was obtained (thus R.A.D. indicates Royal Albert Dock, S.C.D. Surrey Commercial Dock, &c.) and a number. In their daily report sheets the Assistant Rat Officers enter each letter-number combination, with notes opposite showing exactly where and how each rat was obtained. They then place the rats in a linen bag, which they put in a tin box. At the end of the day they deliver the tin boxes at the laboratory of the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, and receive in exchange empty bags and boxes for the next day's rats. Rats are delivered about 5 p.m., and examined next morning. If any rats were found Plague-infected the letters and number on the label attached would be telephoned to your Medical Officer, who, on reference to the Assistant Rat Officer's reports, could at once ascertain exactly where such rats were obtained and institute Plague preventive measures there. If rats are found dead under circumstances suggesting that they have died of Plague, they are taken at once to the laboratory, and an immediate examination and report is requested. The rats from Tilbury Dock are sent by train from Gravesend to Greenwich, where they are collected each morning by one of the Staff and taken to the laboratory on his way to work. It is not found possible to dip the rats on the Docks in a flea-killing solution, but it has been arranged that the bags containing the rats should be dipped in kerosine at the laboratory. The bags returned empty to the Assistant Rat Officers are therefore saturated in kerosine, which is sufficient to destroy the fleas on the subsequent batches of rats placed in the bags. (2) Measures taken to prevent the passage of rats between ships and shore:— The Port of London Authority have made Bye-laws requiring the Master of every ship to cause all ropes and mooring tackle used for securing ships, either to the shore or mooring buoys, to be fitted with guards, approved by the Authority, to prevent rats passing from the ship to the shore, and to cause all empty cases, packages and barrels to be examined before landing, to ensure that no rats are contained therein. The removal of rats (alive or dead) from ships without previous consent in writing of the Superintendent, is prohibited. Bye-laws also prescribe that, when the discharge or loading of cargo or the landing or embarking of passengers is not actually proceeding, one gangway, whitened for a length of 10 feet at the end next the vessel, may be used as a communication between the ship and the shore, and that the Master shall not have or allow any other communication with the shore, unless the same be fitted with guards, approved by the Authority, to prevent the passage of rats. 25 These Bye-laws are enforced by the officers of the Port of London Authority, and the Sanitary Inspectors of the Port Sanitary Authority also call upon Masters to put guards on their mooring ropes. But the well-known difficulties in regard to the proper application and maintenance of position of rat-guards constantly occur, and it cannot be said that the mooring ropes of the majority of ships in the Port of London are at all times so guarded that a rat could not use them as a means of reaching the shore. There is no doubt that rats very seldom voluntarily run along mooring ropes, and the view is held that such rats as get ashore do so usually by some easier means or accidentally in cargo. (3) Methods of deratisation of :— (a) Ships. The methods employed for the deratisation of ships are:— (1) The burning of Sulphur at the rate of 3 lbs. per 1,000 cubic feet of space, the period of exposure of vessels to the Sulphur Dioxide gas thus generated being not less than six hours, and whenever time permits twelve hours or even longer. Roll Sulphur, of good quality, is used, and is burned in large shallow trays standing in larger trays containing water. Owing to the large burning surface thus obtained, considerably more Sulphur can be burned in one container within six hours than is possible when buckets or pots are used. Cylinders of liquid S02 (Sulphume) are employed in small compartments and life-boats. (2) The generation of Hydrocyanic Acid Gas by various methods. For the destruction of rats a concentration of 0.2 per cent, of HON is attempted, and the minimum period of exposure is two hours. If the fumigation is for the destruction of insect life, bed-bugs and cockroaches, two or three times this concentration is employed and the exposure is twelve to twenty-four hours, according to the time available. The methods of generating HCN employed are the spraying of liquid HCN, the scattering of "Zyklon 'B'" or "Discoids" and the pouring of liquid HCN into trays (Galardi process). "Discoids" were introduced during the year. They are thin discs of wood pulp saturated with liquid HCN. Each discoid holds half an ounce of liquid HCN and they are packed in strong containers each holding 32 discs. They provide an easy and effective method of distributing HCN, since they can be "sailed" into 'tween decks or wings of holds, and they are also useful for the accurate dosage of small compartments. Moreover, the spent discoids can easily be collected and removed after the fumigation. But in the hands of a competent Staff of fumigators all the methods mentioned are effective, and can be applied to small cargo vessels or large passenger liners without undue risk. Conversely, if the fumigators are inexperienced or careless or there is imperfect organisation or lack of discipline, any method of Cyanide fumigation may not only be ineffective, but is very likely to result in fatal accidents. In London ships are fumigated only when the holds are empty, or very nearly so, except when there is definite evidence or strong suspicion of the existence of rodent Plague on board. In the latter event a preliminary fumigation with HCN would be undertaken immediately, whether the holds were full or partly discharged, with the object of destroying as many rats and fleas as possible and thus diminishing the risk of the spread of the infection to the shore rats. But, since complete deratisation of a loaded ship cannot be guaranteed, the vessel would be again fumigated throughout when empty. (3) Trapping. All vessels from Plague-infected ports are required to have traps set on board, in order that specimens may, if possible, be obtained for bacteriological examination. All other vessels, on which there is evidence of rats, but not of such a number as to justify a demand for fumigation, are required to have traps set in all spaces where signs of 26 rats are discovered. The trapping may be carried out by professional rat-catchers or, in some cases, by members of the crew, under the supervision of the officers of the Port Sanitary Authority. (b) Premises in the vicinity of Docks and Quays. The Port of London Authority constantly carry out methods of rat-destruction ashore in the Port. Trapping is the method principally employed, but the Authority are always ready to test any new method of rat-destruction that is brought to their notice. The condition of all shore premises is under the constant supervision of the Sanitary Inspectors and Assistant Rat Officers of the Port Sanitary Authority, who draw the attention of the officers of the Port of London Authority to any signs of rat-infestation they may discover. (4) Measures taken for the detection of rat prevalence in ships and on shore:— Examination by Inspectors and Assistant Rat Officers, as already described. (5) Rat-proofing:— The Port of London Authority have, during the year, continued their scheme of rat-proofing in the Docks and Warehouses. No rat Plague has occurred on shore in the Port for 15 years, and the policy of the Port of London Authority in constantly applying methods of rat-destruction and progressively rat-proofing the Docks and Warehouses has been an important factor in keeping the Port of London free from Plague infection. PUBLIC HEALTH (DERATISATION OF SHIPS) REGULATIONS, 1929. One thousand and fifty-five Certificates were issued under the above Regulations during the year, 171 being Deratisation Certificates and 884 being Certificates of Exemption from Deratisation. The total is 184 less than last year, due partly to the depression in trade and partly to the increase in the number of ports abroad in which Certificates under Article 28 of the International Sanitary Convention, 1926, can be obtained. A second year of experience in carrying out the terms of Article 28 of the Convention has confirmed the opinion that it is workable with a Staff of men of ordinary powers of observation and intelligence, provided they are conscientious, that it is satisfactory to Port Health Authorities and that it is fair to the Shipowners. In London a Certificate of Exemption from Deratisation may only be granted to a ship if there is no evidence at all of rats or the fresh evidence is only slight and limited to one or two compartments. If the fresh evidence is slight but generalised throughout the holds or superstructure, exemption is refused and deratisation is required. If there is any evidence at all of rats, however slight, and even if the issue of an Exemption Certificate is contemplated, traps must be set in every compartment where there is evidence, that is to say, however few the rats, an attempt is made to get rid of them. Further, if a vessel is likely to remain in the Port for a considerable time, she is kept under regular observation during the stay and test trapping is carried out. A graphic record is kept of the previous inspections of every ship using the Port, and in border-line cases the previous history of the ship (i.e., the period since the last fumigation, the result of previous fumigations, whether in previous exemptions the vessel has been absolutely clear or there has been slight evidence, the trade route and the nature of the cargo) is considered and influences the decision. In addition to the graphic record of the previous history, a card index is kept with a card for every ship. On this card is recorded, amongst other information, the date of the last Certificate of Deratisation or Exemption. Every morning a clerk goes through the list of ships arriving the previous day, picks out the appropriate cards and notifies each sanitary inspector of the ships in his district which are due for renewal of their certificates. In addition, the sanitary inspectors ask on board each ship for the production of the current Certificate of Deratisation or Exemption. Each sanitary inspector has an assistant rat officer under him. When a vessel is due for examination the assistant rat officer takes a form which is practically a copy of the part 27 of the International Certificate dealing with the evidence of rats and rat harbourage. He visits the ship at once and inspects all accessible compartments, e.g., officers', crews' and passenger accommodation, galleys, pantries, fore and after peaks, and records his findings. He works systematically from forward-aft. Subsequently he revisits daily during the discharge of cargo till holds are empty. In every case every compartment is inspected. Although it is admitted that conclusions as to the condition of the whole ship might be drawn from inspection of those compartments only which are likely to harbour rats, this is not permitted. Each assistant rat officer is equipped with overalls and an electric torch. Estimates are based principally on the amount of fresh excreta found, but runs, feet marks, tail marks, gnawings and nests are also searched for and their significance carefully considered. Runs are carefully followed and the direction of travel of the rats noted. In bunkers and dusty situations feet and tail marks are relied upon, as excreta is difficult to see and estimate. Moveable harbourage is turned over, and rat-proofing is recommended where there is permanent harbourage or there are runs between compartments. After his inspection, the assistant rat officer reports to his sanitary inspector, who may check the findings and also visit ships in regard to which there is any doubt or difficulty. The sanitary inspector reports to the Medical Officer, who in cases of doubt makes the final decision, after consultation with both the inspecting officers. Both sanitary inspectors and assistant rat officers are seen regularly by the Medical Officer, who discusses with them rat-searching in general or in regard to particular ships. The assistant rat officers fully understand that their findings are liable to be checked abroad and that the reputation of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, in this respect, is in their hands. Rigid rules are not favoured. In the first place, it would be difficult to draw up rules which would be applicable to all the varying conditions encountered. Rat-searching is not work for an automaton, but for an intelligent, keen and, above all, conscientious man. If a man is not conscientious, he will not do his work thoroughly whatever rules are made. It is better that he should be given general instructions, that he should be subject to surprise checking of his findings and that he should understand that any criticism received from another port of a certificate issued on his report is likely to involve him in serious trouble and possibly the loss of his employment. In l!T instances vessels which were found to require deratisation were allowed to proceed to other English ports, on an undertaking in writing being given in each case that the ship would leave the Port of London immediately on completion of the discharge of cargo and would be fumigated immediately on arrival in the next port. This concession is granted only when a vessel is paying off the crew in the next port or when it is necessary to enable a time charter to be fulfilled. Having carried out the detailed inspection, the Port Sanitary Authority would prefer to supervise the fumigation, issue the certificate and obtain the fee, but so long as neither this Port nor the next are exposed to any greater risks of rats getting ashore it seems unreasonable to involve the shipowner in heavy additional expense by insisting on the fumigation being carried out here. The Medical Officer of Health of the next port is always informed of the circumstances immediately. It appears probable that gradually, as the results of Article 28 of the International Sanitary Convention become evident, the proportion of ships exempted to those deratised will increase. But the destruction of rats is not the only object of fumigation. A number of shipowners already recognise its value in clearing their ships of cockroaches, bed-bugs and other insects, and have every vessel of their fleets fumigated at regular intervals. This practice will probably become more general when prosperity returns to the shipping industry, and the time is perhaps not far distant when more ships will be fumigated for the destruction of insects than for the destruction of rats. The difference in the efficiency of Sulphur and Oyanide as insecticides is more marked than the difference in their value for deratisation, but the higher concentrations of Cyanide necessary for the former purpose will need correspondingly greater care and skill on the part of the fumigators, and will emphasize the need for some official control of the methods employed and the personnel engaged in the process. In the hands of experienced and responsible fumigators, HCN is the most efficient fumigant available at the present time and it can be used without risk to 28 human life. But in the hands of the inexperienced and irresponsible, Cyanide is most dangerous not only to the fumigators themselves but to others who trust to them for protection. So far, the business has been on a small scale in this country and de minimis non curat lex. But, though a Port Medical Officer of Health must remain responsible for certifying the efficiency of fumigations carried out in his district, he ought not to have to worry as to whether the fumigators can be trusted to handle the fumigant with safety under ship conditions. A fumigating squad should only be permitted to use Cyanide on condition that they are led by a man with a thorough technical knowledge of the material he is using, all its dangers, all the precautions necessary, the action to be taken in any case of poisoning and the methods of testing for the presence of Cyanide and their significance. Every member of the squad should fully appreciate the danger of Cyanide and be thoroughly trained in the use and care of gas masks and oxygen-breathing apparatus. He should have practical training in the rescue of persons overcome in irrespirable atmospheres and their first-aid treatment, and he should know his way about ships of all types, so that in the most complicated passenger accommodation he may always arrange to work towards the exit provided and never fail to find it. Such conditions may seem likely to hamper Cyanide in competition with Sulphur, but Cyanide fumigating squads need, and indeed should, only be small, and if the requirements for safety are neglected fatal accidents will occur. Such accidents are to be deplored not only on account of the loss of valuable lives but because they create in the minds of shipowners a prejudice against the most efficient fumigant at our command.

British 10,193 124 598 2,628 Other Nations 4,873 Hygiene of Crew Accommodation. A period of trade depression is not likely to be marked by the introduction of improved standards of accommodation for seamen on board British ships. But ships built now may well be in commission 20 or even 80 years hence, and they should therefore be designed with a view to providing quarters which will be regarded as at least reasonably satisfactorily, from the point of view of hygiene, for many years to come. The Shipping Federation appointed a Committee more than two years ago to advise on officers' and crews' accommodation in cargo vessels. This Committee has already produced three very valuable reports. Though no new standards as regards cubic space are laid down, it is apparent from the plans in the reports that a much more generous allowance than the minimum requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act is favoured. If the advice contained in these reports is put into practice by shipbuilders, a very great improvement in the living conditions of seamen on board our ships will result. It is understood that the Board of Trade have brought these reports to the notice of their Surveyors, and have instructed them to bring the recommendations to the notice of owners and builders with a view to their adoption in any new ships under construction. No new standards are imposed by the Board of Trade, and compliance on the part of the owners and builders will be entirely 80 voluntary, but it is to be hoped that they will take the long view and act on the recommendations. New systems of heating and ventilation are recommended by the Shipping Federation Committee, and though they appear sound in principle, they have not yet been tried sufficiently widely to enable an opinion to be expressed as to whether they will be found to be efficient in practice under all conditions. The problem of the proper ventilation of small compartments without intolerable draught is sufficiently difficult in premises ashore. It is far more difficult on board ship and is surely worthy of attention from, and experiment by experts in practical ventilation. At the present time it is almost the rule to find the ventilators to crew's quarters plugged up by the men. Port Sanitary Inspectors may order the removal of the obstruction, but they well know that it will be replaced at the earliest possible opportunity, not because the men enjoy a stuffy atmosphere, but because they dislike a cold draught. Firemen, coming from work in the hot stokehold, are naturally very intolerant of a strong current of cold air in their sleeping quarters. It is not uncommon to find ventilators opening directly over bunks, an arrangement which should surely be altered before ever the ship is put in commission. The Shipping Federation Committee have recommended a system of free ventilation of alleyways, the bulkheads separating compartments from the alleyways being incomplete above and below so that fresh air can enter and vitiated air escape. This is undoubtedly a better arrangement than having simple cowl ventilators opening directly into compartments, but even so there are possibilities of cold draughts and consequently the blocking up of the spaces through which fresh air enters. The Shipping Federation report also recommends a system of central heating of crews' quarters by low-pressure hot water, and it would seem desirable to devise some means whereby this hot-water system might be employed to at least take the chill off the incoming fresh air. One of your Sanitary Inspectors, Mr. Clifford, has suggested a scheme by which fresh air would traverse a hot-water radiator as it was admitted to living compartments. The principle is, of course, sound, and is put into practice ashore, but the details of its application to ship conditions would need special consideration. The fact remains that the acute discomfort of a cold draught is painfully obvious to the occupants of a room, whereas the ill-effects of insufficient ventilation are not, and therefore ventilation will continue to be obstructed until a practical solution of the problem is found. It is not a question of designing some complicated and mechanical appliance, the system must be simple, inexpensive and fool-proof, but none the less it calls for expert attention. Mr. Clifford also designed an extraction ventilator which could remain in position under any conditions without there being any danger of water entering the quarters through it. This was brought to the notice of the Board of Trade, the Shipping Federation and the Association of Port Sanitary Authorities. The Board of Trade criticised the ventilator mainly on the grounds that if the ship was stationary and there was no wind the ventilator would not function, but under such conditions it would usually be possible to have side scuttles and doors open. In any case the occasions on which this ventilator Avould fail to act would be few in comparison with the number of times the existing ventilators are found to be completely plugged by the men. If such a system of extraction of foul air could be combined with an arrangement for slightly warming incoming air, even the small crowded compartments provided for seamen afloat might be adequately and comfortably ventilated. Increased cubic space and floor space per man, four-berth sleeping rooms, separate mess rooms and drying rooms, and many more improvements are advocated in the excellent reports of the Shipping Federation Committee, and the practical application of these recommendations will be eagerly awaited by all who are interested in the welfare of seamen. There remains the problem of ships already in commission, and in which the crew accommodation is unsatisfactory. Perhaps nothing can be done in this time of trade depression, but if the improvements suggested are embodied in all new ships, a new standard will be set and proposals for improvements in the old ships will, in consequence, receive more attention than they do at present. 81 VII— FOOD INSPECTION. The facts that the Port of London extends over such a wide area and that Foodstuffs may be landed at almost any point makes it impossible to divide the Staff strictly into Food Inspectors and Sanitary Inspectors. There are certain parts of the Docks where the nature and quantity of the Foodstuffs landed are such that a whole-time Food Inspector is essential, but there are many districts where the food inspection and sanitary inspection must be combined. For this reason every Sanitary Inspector in the Port of London is required to qualify as a Food Inspector, and at the present time every member of the Staff of Inspectors is qualified in both respects. So great are the food imports in London that it is obviously impossible for everything to come under inspection. At the same time, the control is greater than might at first appear possible, for Inspectors have not only the information contained in the Customs Bill of Entry at their disposal, but, from the fact that they are constantly on the Docks, they have many sources of information open to them, and they receive the assistance of Customs Officers and others. From experience also, they know what has proved consistently sound and what needs their careful attention. They recognise what is new, and therefore to be carefully examined. Above all, they receive every assistance from the importers, who do not wish to put food of even doubtful quality on the market. There is, however, another way in which a Port Sanitary Authority may act if, from their own observation or from reports received from other Sanitary Authorities, it appears necessary to exercise complete control over any particular class of imported food. All imports of such foods can be detained within the district of the Authority for examination by their Inspectors. Such action is from time to time taken, but in order to avoid complete dislocation of the trade concerned it is usual to allow consignments to leave the Docks, on the understanding that they will be held for examination by the Medical Officers of Health of the districts of destination, who must have previously expressed their willingness to receive and take responsibility for the inspection of the goods. This was the principle put into practice in regard to imported Mutton and Lamb during the latter part of 1928, and was continued until June, 1929, when the improvement resulting from the institution of examination in the countries of origin was so marked as to make it possible to reduce the routine examination to 10 per cent. Importers realise that it is in their interests to attain a high standard of examination at the source, and, in addition, to have goods so prepared and packed as to facilitate examination here. Thus, Ox Tongues arrive dressed so as to have the lymphatic glands easily accessible. Pig carcases have the submaxillary glands incised and drawn forward in an exposed position, so that no difficulty is experienced in examining the carcases in the frozen state. Imported Offal is packed with a view to rapid inspection, as is also boneless Veal, in which care is taken to expose the serous membranes. As regards Canned Goods, a considerable proportion is submitted for examination by expert examiners, on behalf of the merchants. From experience, the Port Sanitary Authority have complete confidence in this examination, which is of great assistance to their Inspectors. When diseased or unsound food is discovered it is almost invariably voluntarily surrendered, and it is very rare indeed that it is necessary for the Port Sanitary Authority to go through the formal procedure of seizure and condemnation by a Magistrate. The majority of Foodstuffs condemned as unfit for human consumption is not destroyed, but is used for some industrial purpose, such as the manufacture of poultry food, soap, grease, &c. In every case the Port Sanitary Authority obtain guarantees and require to be satisfied that there is no danger that such condemned food, when it leaves their district, will be sold elsewhere for human food. Thus it comes about that, though such vast quantities of food are imported, and the number of Inspectors is few, the amount of food which goes into consumption in an unsatisfactory condition is infinitesimal. 82 (1) Action under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, resulted in 1,408 tons 8 cwts. 1 qr. 17 lbs. of unsound food being destroyed or disposed of for purposes other than human consumption.

Imported Mutton Infected with Caseous Lymphadenitis. The control of imported Mutton on account of Caseous Lymphadenitis was continued throughout the year, in accordance with the decision of the Ministry of Health, as the result of a Conference held in December, 1930. At this Conference it was found that the standard of examination in Australia and New Zealand had improved to such an extent that the routine sampling might be reduced from ten to five per cent, of imports from these two countries. In regard to Mutton imported from South America, it appeared that the standard was not so satisfactory, and that, therefore, the examination of ten per cent, of such carcases on arrival should be continued. It was further decided to continue the 100 per cent, examination of pieces of Mutton whatever the country of origin. In August the Ministry of Health called for a Return showing the results of the examination of all carcases of Mutton during the first six months of the year. As the result of consideration of the Returns received, it was decided that no change in the existing arrangements in regard to inspection should be made. 34 Caseous Lymphadenitis.— Mutton and lamb, weight 43 lbs. and over, from Australia, New Zealand and South America.

For action under these Regulations, reference is directed to the list of foodstuffs submitted for analysis. FERTILISERS AND FEEDING STUFFS ACT, 1926. No samples were taken under this Act during the year. (2) SHELLFISH. PUBLIC HEALTH (SHELLFISH) REGULATIONS, 1915. ORDERS OF NOVEMBER, "1916. The shellfish layings on the North side of the estuary of the Thames continued to be subject to the Order issued by the Port of London Sanitary Authority in November, 1916. As reported last year, it is desirable to modify this Order, but there is no provision in the Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations for such modification, and consequently nothing can be done at present. No cases of illness were reported during the year as having been traced to the consumption of shellfish from the layings in the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. (3) SAMPLES OF FOOD EXAMINED DUPING THE YEAR. Canned Mushrooms prom Russia. A sample was drawn from a consignment of canned mushrooms from Russia, and on opening a tin it was noticed that the contents differed in appearance from the ordinary English mushroom. Specimens were therefore sent to the Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, with a request that he would kindly report as to whether these were all true mushrooms or fungi of an edible type. The Director very kindly had the specimens examined by a member of his Staff, who reported as follows :— "This sample submitted contains very young specimens of a species of Boletus. These are, of course, not true 'mushrooms,' which are Psalliota campestris, but the word 'mushrooms' is often used loosely for any fungi of an edible type, and I am told is usually so used in Russia. It is not possible to give a definite specific determination from such young specimens, but the habit and reticulate stem indicate either a form of Boletus edulis, the well-known ' cep ' of the Continent, or a species closely allied. I have not seen in this country such a bright reddish colour in any of the Boletus edulis group, but a Member of the Imperial Mycological Institute tells me that he is familiar with this form in Russia and that the colour is just as bright in the fresh state. According to him, several species of edible Boleti are preserved in liquid, in either vinegar or salt solution." Cheese Wrapped in Tin Foil. Eleven cases of Petit Gruyere cheese arrived from Antwerp in the St. Katharine Dock on the 24th February, 1928. They remained in store on the Dock. On the 21st January, 1931, your Food Inspector decided to examine the cheese, with a view to ascertaining whether it was still sound after nearly three years' storage. The cheese appeared to be of normal consistency and taste, but the surface showed dark staining and the inner surface of the tin foil was dull and blackened where it was in direct contact with the cheese. A sample was drawn and sent to your Public Analyst, who reported the cheese to contain 0.69 per cent, of tin, equivalent to 4.83 grains of tin per pound of cheese. The consignment was accordingly placed under detention and the owner was requested 38 to give authority for its destruction, but he did not reply and the cheese remained in storage until 15th October, when another sample was drawn and on analysis was found to contain the equivalent of 9.31 grains of tin per pound of cheese. Mr. Solicitor then communicated with the Importer with a view to application being made for a Magistrate's order for the destruction of the cheese. The Importer, however, promptly replied authorising its destruction. It is interesting to note that, between January and October, the amount of tin absorbed from the tin foil wrapping increased from 4.83 to 9.31 grains per pound. Another consignment of Petit Gruyere cheese was destroyed in November, on account of the presence of 2.24 grains of tin per pound. (a) Bacteriologist— Date. Sample. Analyst's Report Action taken. 1931. May 19 Cheese The sample appears clean and has no smell other than might be expected from edible cheese. Film preparations show numerous gram negative and gram positive bacilli and gram positive cocci. Cultures. Consignment released. (1) Dilutions of ^ c.c. downwards show no B. Coli. (2) Cultures of a loopful of a dilution of 1 in 10 sawn into lactose agar are sterile. (3) Anaerobic milk cultures of dilutions of c.c. downwards show no B. Welchii. Animal Experiments. Two mice fed for one week on dry bread soaked in the fluid portion of the cheese and on the solid portion of the cheese are well at the end of the week. The cheese appears to have been rendered sterile by same means, and it does not contain toxic products. From a bacteriological point of view, it appears fit for human consumption. No investigations have been carried out to establish the presence or otherwise of disinfectants.
