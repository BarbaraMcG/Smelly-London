During the past season the whole of the streets, &c., have been constantly watered by the Contractors with water from the East London Water Works. RENAMING STREETS, & RENUMBERING HOUSES THEREIN. The Metropolitan Board of Works made an order for incorporating Durham Row with Church Row, Ratcliff, and for the houses to be renumbered. CONTRACTS. The Contract for Paving Works, &c., having expired at Ladyday, 1878, the same was, after consideration by the Works and Survey Committee, renewed with the Contractor for a further term of two years, upon the same terms as before, with the exception of a small increase on some of the items for trench work. CANAL BOATS ACT. The Board having been made a Registration Authority under the Canal Boats Act, 1877, which came into force on the 1st January, 1879, the necessary arrangements have been made by the Board for the Registration of Canal Boats, and for the supervision thereof, as laid down in the Act. BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. Thames River (Prevention of Floods) Bill.—A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons by the Metropolitan Board of Works intituled, "A Bill to amend the Metropolis Management Act of 1855, and the Acts amending the same, so far as relates to the protection of the Metropolis from floods and inundations, caused by the overflow of the Thames, and for other purposes." As the Bill provided that compensation should be paid to owners in respect of the execution of flood works upon their lands and premises, and as it provided for no power of appeal from any decision of the Metropolitan Board in respect of the nature of the works necessary to prevent flooding, the Board determined that the Bill should be opposed, and accordingly a Petition was prepared and presented to the House of Commons against the Bill, praying to be heard by counsel, &c. LONDON & BLACKWALL RAILWAY. LIMEHOUSE CURVE. Under the London and Blackwall Railway Act, 1877, the pany are bound to submit the plans of the new Works affecting streets in the District to the Board for its approval. The plans for the new Railway which were prepared by the Engineer of the Great Eastern Railway, were accordingly submitted for the approval of the Board, and also, as provided in the Act, for the approval of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Careful consideration was given by me to the same, and I had several interviews with the officers of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Engineer of the Great Eastern Railway, so as to arrange for the works being carried out in the most convenient way for the traffic, and as far as possible to improve the present thoroughfares where the Railway passes over them: the result being that my requisitions and those of the Metropolitan Board of Works were agreed to by the Company, who undertook to carry out the same. The London and Blackwall Railway Company have since given formal notice, as required by the Act of Parliament, of the commencement of the works, and they will be proceeded with forthwith. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. to the BOARD OF WORKS LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. health and sanitary condition of the Limehouse District during the year 1878. Like its immediate predecessor, 1878 will be remembered as having been a year in which Small Pox was prevalent in the Metropolis to such an extent as to constitute an epidemic, yet it was not an unhealthy year, as the following figures will prove:—In the period under consideration there were registered in the District 1,326 deaths—these include 97 deaths of non-residents which occurred in the East London Hospital for Children. Deducting these deaths of non-residents, we get, as a result, 1,229 as representing the number of deaths of residents in your District. To this number we must Add, however, our proportion of deaths in the Public Institutions of London. This year that number is 255, which, added to 1,229, gives a total of 1,484 deaths as the for the Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Keport on the 2 mortality of your District. This number represents a death rate of 24.7 per 1,000 living for the year, and the calculations and Tables in the following pages are based upon it. The Metropolitan death rate for 1878 was 23.5 per 1,000. The death rate of your District, therefore, was 1.2 above that of the Metropolis. Considering that a very large proportion of the population of this District are persons in humble circumstances, exposed to all vicissitudes of temperature, literally gaining their bread by the sweat of their brow, frequently out of employment, and that at the most inclement time of the year, when they, their wives, and little ones must severely feel the sharp pains of hunger, and the biting nip of cold, one would expect to find the death rate of the District rather in excess of that of the Metropolis. Warm clothing, nutritious food, well-built and ventilated houses, are great factors in reducing the death rate of a District. The converse of the proposition is equally true. During the year there were registered 2,240 births, which number indicates a birth rate of 36 per 1,000 of the population; there were also registered 544 marriages. By referring to Table I. you will find that the births and deaths were both above the average of the ten years 1868—77, while the marriages were below the average. Of the total number of deaths 25 per cent. were those of children under 1 year, and 45 per cent. were those of children under 5 years of age. Although these numbers must convey to your minds a feeling of at least regret that the infant mortality should be of 3 such proportions, I must point out to you that it is less in both cases than the average of the 9 years 1869—77, that of the deaths of children under one year having been 27 per cent., and under 5 years nearly 50 per cent. Information on this point may be gained from a perusal of Table II. Zymotic diseases, such as Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea, contributed a large share towards this infant mortality, no less than 231 of the 288 deaths from diseases of a Zymotic character having been those of children under five years of age—Whooping Cough and Diarrhoea having contributed between them 135. Of 205 deaths from Constitutional diseases, 89 were those of children under 5 years of age, of which number 67 were due to Tabes Mesenterica, popularly known as Consumption of the Bowels. Of 526 deaths from local diseases, 234 were those of children under 5 years of age. Local diseases include Diseases of the Brain and Nervous System, of the Organs of Circulation, of the Organs of Eespiration, and the other various organs and members of the body. Of these 234 deaths, 71 were due to Inflammation of the Brain and Convulsions, and 140 to inflammatory affections of the lungs, such as Bronchitis and Pneumonia. Of 130 deaths from diseases incidental to Development, 83 were those of children under 5 years of age. Of these 29 were due to premature Birth, 20 to Teething, and 31 to Debility. We find, therefore, that the principal causes of infant mortality in the District have been Measles, Whooping Cough, Diarrhœa, Tabes Mesenterica, Inflammation of the Brain, Convulsions, 4 chitis, Pneumonia, Premature Birth, Teething, and Atrophy. Of Measles, I will only say that the disease is not generally regarded with that concern which it deserves. It is thought to be an inevitable disease of childhood, and as a rule no efforts are made to isolate the patient from the rest of the family. "Whooping Cough also is not shunned as it should be. Children with the disease play about among others, they are carried in public conveyances, and are allowed to circulate freely among the rest of the community. Diarrhoea among children is a disease usually rife in summer, and it has been noticed that when the temperature of. the Thames water rises above 60°F., the affection appears. There is no doubt that it is due, in a great measure, to decomposition of the milk, which forms a large proportion of the diet of children, together with the employment of improper and indigestible food. Its fatality is increased by the apathy with which its first symptoms are observed, and before medical aid is obtained the poor little sufferer drifts into a condition in which nothing can be done for it. Tabes Mesenterica is also a disease aggravated, if not caused, by the use of improper and indigestible food—the child becomes emaciated, and the mother thinks to cure the emaciation by the administration of plenty of nourishment. All her efforts are directed in the wrong way, her treatment adds fuel to the fire, the child rapidly wastes, its belly enlarges, and when it comes under the doctor's hands very little can be done for it, and it dies literally starved in the midst of plenty. Inflammation of the Brain and Convulsions are frequently caused by defective and improper nutrition, as well as by teething. 5 A frequent cause also is accidental violence—the infant is entrusted to a young girl, who can hardly stagger along under her burthen; the child has an unlucky fall on its head, and in due course symptoms of inflammation appear; the girl strenuously denies all knowledge of an accident, and thus many cases remain involved in obscurity as to their origin. As regards Bronchitis and Pneumonia I am only astonished that the deaths from them are not more frequent; children are taken out suffering from these diseases in the most inclement weather; very few of the houses of the poor are adapted for the successful treatment of these affections; there is either too much ventilation or not enough, and many lives are sacrificed annually from these causes. To sum up the matter, the infant mortality of this District is due, in a great measure, to improper management on the part of persons having the care of children, either from ignorance or carelessness. Until they are taught the laws of health, and consent to practice them, this excessive infant mortality will prevail. General Mortality of the District. Zymotic Diseases.—Notwithstanding the prevalence of Small Pox, the number of deaths registered from diseases of a Zymotic character were considerably less than in the preceding year, the numbers having been for 1877, 331, and for 1878, 288. The deaths from the seven principal diseases of this class were equal to 4.7 per 1,000 of population, and of every 1,000 deaths registered 192 were 6 due to such diseases. Small Pox continued in this year, as in the last, to absorb a considerable share of the attention of your Sanitary staff. I find that of the total number of deaths from this disease 24 occurred in the District, and 39 in the Small Pox Hospitals. Every effort was made to procure the removal of persons suffering from the disease to the Hospital, with what success the above numbers show. Scarlatina, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea were the principal causes of the mortality in this class, Whooping Cough having shown a material advance on the number of deaths due to it in the previous year, Pulmonary Diseases (other than Phthisis) caused the deaths of 295 persons, which is equivalent to a death rate of 4.9 per 1,000 of the population. Of a thousand registered deaths 199 were due to diseases of this class. Pneumonia and Bronchitis contributed between them no less than 272 deaths. Tubercular Diseases, including Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes were fatal to 166 persons, thus representing a mortality from these causes equal to a rate of 2.7 per 1,000. Of 1,000 deaths from all causes, 112 were due to diseases of this class. Wasting Diseases of Infants, such as Marasmus, Atrophy, Want of Breast Milk, and Premature Birth, resulted in the deaths of 131. This number is equivalent to a death rate of 2.1 per 1,000 living, and of 1,000 deaths registered from all causes 88 were due to diseases of this description. The Convulsive Diseases of Infants carried off 108, which 7 number is equivalent to a death rate from such affections of 1.8 per 1,000 living, and of 1,000 deaths registered from all causes 73 were due to diseases of this class. Hospital Accommodation for non-destitute infectious sick. I suppose that in these days there will be found no one willing to deny that the most efficient method of controlling the spread of infectious disease is to isolate the infected. From the most ancient times the system of isolation has been practised. It is enjoined in the Mosaic law with a strictness that we should "consider at the present day irksome if carried into execution. In those days the leper must have had a hard time of it. He was practically dead; he was cut off from all intercourse with his fellow beings, except those in a condition similar to himself. I cannot help thinking that in this matter of isolation of the infected we have retrograded rather than progressed; the liberty of the subject has been considered before the public good. It is true that certain enactments have been made having for their object the isolation of persons suffering from infectious disease, and I would mention especially certain sections of the sanitary Act of 1866. By Section 37 of this Act the Sanitary Authority of a District is empowered to provide Hospital accommodation for persons in their District who are suffering from infectious disease: they may do this either by building Hospitals of their own, or by contracting with existing Hospitals for the required accommodation, and two or more Sanitary Authorities may combine 8 in this action. Now at first sight this looks well enough, but when we come to examine the matter closely we shall find difficulties in the way of the first of these alternatives which would render its adoption well nigh impossible. For each Metropolitan Authority to build Hospitals (and at the least two would be required, one for Small Pox and the other for Fever), would be a task surrounded with great difficulty. I doubt very much whether it would be possible; certainly, if it were, it would be at the outlay of immense sums of money. Where in this District could we find a site for a Hospital? I have no hesitation in saying nowhere. I do not know of a site where such buildings could be put up—the District is not adapted for it. To erect a Hospital for the reception of persons suffering from contagious diseases in the midst of a crowded District like yours would be, to say the least of it, an act of imprudence; and I have no hesitation in affirming the same with regard to most of the other Metropolitan Districts. If you determined to erect your own Hospitals, you must go outside London to procure a site, and so must the rest of the Metropolitan Districts. Now, what would be the result of that? It would be to surround London with a cordon of Hospitals for the treatment of the infectious sick. Such a state of things could not be thought of seriously for one moment, and I do not think was ever contemplated by the Legislature. The next alternative would be to contract with existing Hospitals, but in this there arises the difficulty that only two would be available, viz., the Small Pox Hospital at Highgate, and the London Fever Hospital. Now I need hardly say that the accommodation that could be afforded by these 9 Hospitals would not be sufficient for the infectious sick of nearly four million people during an epidemic. It might be sufficient, and more than sufficient, during ordinary times, but the events of the past few years should teach us that we should not be satisfied with such accommodation, but should be able to grapple with emergencies such as an epidemic of infectious disease. The objections urged against the first and second alternatives apply to the third, viz., the combined action of two or more Local Authorities. Some few years ago, when Sanitary matters began to occupy the attention of our Rulers, and the necessity for the isolation of the infectious sick became apparent, a number of Hospitals for the treatment of such cases were built, and a Board of Management—the Metropolitan Asylums District Board—called into existence. Now many people, I dare say, thought that these Hospitals, which had cost much money, would be available for the infectious sick of all classes; that any person suffering from an infectious disease, and who so wished it, would be entitled to admission, and that he would be able to pay for the accommodation; but no, these Hospitals were for paupers only; to be eligible for admission, one must be a pauper, and forfeit one's civil rights, and undergo all the pains and penalties attaching to such a condition. In other words, the persons who paid for these establishments were not to be admitted to their benefits; the ratepayer, who had the misfortune to be laid down with Small Pox or Fever, must stay at home, and become a centre of infection to his wife, little ones, and neighbours, or consent to become a pauper. It is true that he might be removed to 10 either the Highgate Small Pox Hospital, or the London Fever Hospital, but if the diseases treated at these establishments were epidemic, he might not obtain admission. Now, gentlemen, this was the position of affairs at the beginning of 1878, when we found ourselves iu the midst of an epidemic of Small Pox. Your Board felt how unsatisfactory that position was, and to its lasting credit took steps to remedy the anomalous condition of affairs. Yes, gentlemen, to the Board of Works for the Limehouse District belongs the honour of taking the initiative in the enquiry as to how the non-destitute infectious sick should receive Hospital accommodation, and of conducting that enquiry to a successful issue—to your Board belongs the credit of evolving order from chaos, and of conferring on your fellow citizens a lasting benefaction. At the invitation of your Board, meetings of delegates from the different Metropolitan Local Authorities took place, and considered the matter, the result being that a deputation of delegates waited upon, and was received by, Mr. Sclater Booth, the President of the Local Government Board, to urge upon him the desirability of an alteration in the condition of the law; and the result of that interview was that a short Act has been passed by Parliament giving the Metropolitan Asylums Board power to contract with the different Local Sanitary Authorities for the reception and treatment of their non-destitute infectious sick. Sanitary Work. The first locality that claimed my attention in the year was that 11 situated between Willow Row on the North, Ropemakers' Fields on the South, Nightingale Tavern on the West, and the Barley Mow Brewery on the East. I had frequently to examine this locality on account of the dilapidated condition of the houses contained therein; the Inspector was constantly reporting to me concerning sanitary defects there; and I finally came to the conclusion to make a representation to the Metropolitan Board of Works under the provisions of the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. I am confident that the houses are incapable of further repair; the closets are constantly becoming stopped; the ground floors of many of the houses are below the level of the surface, and the area is distinguished by a death rate much higher than that of the District. The Representation has been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and after some further information which I have to furnish to that body, I hope will be considered in a favourable manner. The site in question, abutting on no valuable frontage, and consisting for the most part of dilapidated houses, would form a valuable investment for the Trustees of the late George Peabody's fund. Small Pox continuing to increase during the early part of the year, the Board, on Jan. 16th, passed a resolution to form a Committee, whose special duty would be to take cognizance of the progress of the disease, and devise means for the prevention of its extension. The Epidemic Committee thus formed met whenever occasion required, sometimes as many as three times a week, and to it my duty was to report the progress of the epidemic, and 12 to advise as to the best means to be adopted under the circumstances. The question of the Hospital accommodation of the non pauper infectious sick occupied the attention of the Committee at nearly every meeting, and it was to its efforts that we are indebted for the elaboration of the scheme which resulted in the meeting of delegates from the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis at Cannon Street Hotel on the 18th June, to consider the question which has lately been so happily solved. Among its other works, I may mention the erection of a second disinfecting apparatus, the one already in existence having proved hardly adequate to the strain of such a severe epidemic. An intelligent and systematic inspection of all houses, especially those in the infected localities, was undertaken by an extra Inspector, and resulted in the collection of most valuable information. Elizabeth Court, Brook Street, Ratcliff, was a place I was always prepared to hear something bad of; the houses are built back to back, with no through ventilation; they are very small, consisting of only two rooms, and there was always something wrong there. Patching up and remedying minor evils only deferred the evil day, and I finally determined to ask your Board to take the steps necessary for closing them until such works had been performed as would render them fairly habitable. To my request you acceded, and the Magistrate made the order for closing the houses. The repairs were executed, and for a few weeks all went well, but the place is getting into its old condition, and it will be my duty 13 to draw your attention to it again on some future occasion. The Dustyards of the District have come under my special notice during the year. Complaints have been made to me regarding the condition of Messrs. Abbott's yard in Dod Street, and Mr. Parsons' yard in Lower Shadwell. At your request I made a report on their condition, and elicited the fact that the Limehouse District is the receptacle for a large portion of the refuse of the neighbouring parishes of St. George, Poplar, Bethnal Green, and Whitechapel. My Report was received by your Board, and ordered to be printed and circulated among the members, but as some of the gentlemen into whose hands this Annual Report will fall were not at that time members of the Board, I subjoin a copy of the Report then made by me. "Report of the Medical Officer, presented to the Works Committee on the 4th day of November, 1878, in reference to the Dust Yards in the District being made a receptacle for the street refuse of adjoining districts. "To the Members of the Works Committee. "Gentlemen, "By the direction of the Board of Works for the Limehouse District, I have made an inspection of the Dust Yards in the District, and beg to report as follows:— "In the Limehouse District there are three Dust Yards. "They are owned or occupied by Messrs. P. & E. Abbott, of 14 Limehouse; Mr. James Rollinson, of Limehouse; and Mr. Charles Townsend Parsons, of Shadwell, respectively. "The yard occupied by Messrs. P. & E. Abbott, is situated in Dod Street, Burdett Road, on the South Bank of the Limehouse Cut. The yard occupied by Mr. James Rollinson, is situated in Copenhagen Place, on the North Bank of the Limehouse Cut. "The yard occupied by Mr. Parsons is in Lower Shadwell, near the River side. "Messrs. P. & E. Abbott, besides having a Contract with the Board of Works for the Limehouse District for the removal of certain refuse, have a Contract of a similar character with the Vestry of St. George in the East. "Mr. James Rollinson has a Contract with the Board of Works for the Limehouse District, and with the Board of Works for the Poplar District. "A portion of the refuse of Bethnal Green is allowed by arrangement to be discharged in this yard." "Mr. C. T. Parsons has a Contract with the Board of Works for the Limehouse District. The Whitechapel refuse, and a portion of the refuse of Bethnal Green is allowed to be discharged in this yard. "The composition of the refuse carted to these yards may be considered as composed of (a) Road Sweepings (b) house refuse, (c) trade refuse. The road sweepings vary considerably in composition and consistence, according to the locality from which they are taken, 15 and the weather prevailing at the time they are collected. From some localities the animal matter in these sweepings is large in quantity, from others small, sometimes it is a slop, and at other times a dry pungent powder. "The house refuse varies also in composition, but it may be considered as consisting primarily of four distinct component parts known in the trade as hard core, soft core, ashes and breeze. The hard core consists of brickbats, stones, etc., and is used for making up roads. The soft core consists of vegetable and animal matter. The breeze is the dust sifted from the ashes. "The trade refuse must necessarily also vary in composition, sometimes ashes form a large portion of it, at other times it will consist to a great extent of animal and vegetable matter. "Of all these substances, those belonging to the animal or vegetable kingdoms are the most likely to prove injurious to health. I cannot condemn too strongly the practise of allowing these substances to accumulate in large quantities and pass into a state of decay. We must not forget also that decomposition has in many cases, I may say in most cases, set in before the house dust-bin has been opened and cleared. Who has not experienced, and having experienced who does not remember, the disgusting odour emitted during the operation of emptying a dust-bin. To carry the offensive matter uncovered and exposed to the mid-day sun along a crowded thoroughfare is bad enough, but to store it in a yard in the neighbourhood of inhabited houses until a convenient opportunity 16 occurs for getting rid of it, and then to turn it over to emit still more disgusting odours is a practise fraught with danger to the public health, and should not be tolerated. "The conclusion, then, that forces itself upon me is that our present system of dusting is radically defective and dangerous. The dust-bin should be done away with, and the house refuse placed in small covered receptacles outside all houses every morning, and emptied into carts before the traffic of the day commences. "These carts should be covered both to prevent effluvium and the blowing about of dust, and they should be emptied, as should also those containing street sweepings and trade refuse, at once into barges, covered and carried away, thus preventing the serious evils arising from sifting the dust in the yards, and from the same being blown about in the locality during stormy weather. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Gr. A. ROGERS, Nov. 4th, 1878, Medical Officer of Health. Your Resolution on this Report was that the matter stand over for further consideration. M any other matters came under my consideration, among which I may mention the complaint of the School Board Officers at the School in High Street, Shadwell, against Mr. Smellie and Mr. Boorman, for causing a nuisance—in the one case by the operations 17 carried on by him in his business of tripe dresser, and in the other by permitting the accumulation of dung on his premises, where he carries on the business of a cow-keeper. Mr. Smellie's premises were carefully inspected by me on several occasions, but nothing to complain of was discovered. Moreover, he had complied with the bye-laws laid down by the Metropolitan Board of Works. Mr. Boorman had his license granted at the sessions, but it was on the understanding that a more frequent removal of dung took place. I have had no further complaint. Again I have to report numerous complaints of the effluvia arising from the sewer ventilators. It appears that the Metropolitan Board of Works have not yet discovered a remedy for the evil. It is impossible to say how much disease is engendered by this constant discharge of offensive vapour into our thoroughfares, but that it is something considerable one cannot doubt. The air cannot be polluted in this wholesale way without the public health suffering. Many a Continental city, which has earned a bad reputation in the way of smells, is a garden of roses compared to the vicinity of these ventilators. A most important Act, the Canal Boats' Act, was brought under your notice during the year. It is not my intention to go through and examine each section, it being sufficient for my purpose to indicate its general object. I take it, that that object is to abate over-crowding on board the boats which ply on our Canals, and to prevent the spread of infectious diseases by the occupants of such 18 boats. There are three Metropolitan Authorities under the Act, viz., the Vestry of Paddington, the Vestry of Rotherhithe, and your Board; and I have the honour to be your Inspector under the Act. As hinted at before, a very large number of houses have been inspected in the District. I find from the returns furnished to me by the Inspectors that this number is 2,073. The orders issued for Sanitary amendments therein amounted to 1,235. The number of houses cleansed, repaired, and whitewashed was 620, and the number of houses disinfected after the occurrence of infectious disease was 450. One hundred and fifty-five house drains were repaired and cleansed, and 161 trapped or ventilated. One hundred and six water closets or privies were repaired and cleansed, and 8 were supplied with water. Two hundred and seventy-four new dustbins were provided, and 190 were repaired. Two hundred and sixty-three cisterns were cleansed, repaired, and covered. In addition to this several hundred articles of clothing and bedding, &c., were disinfected by heat in the Board's disinfecting ovens, and returned to their owners free of charge. In all Sanitary matters I have been ably assisted by the Inspectors, and I beg to record my approval of the manner in which they have performed their arduous, and in many cases unpleasant duties. The Slaughter and Cow Houses in the District were inspected and the defects found therein having been remedied, the renewal of the licenses to these premises was not opposed. For a list of them, and the names of their proprietors, I beg to refer you to Table VIII. 19 Sale of Food and Drugs Act. During the' year eighty-one samples of articles of daily consumption were examined, viz., 16 of Bread, 10 of Flour, 10 of Milk, 9 of Coffee, 6 of Tea, 6 of Isinglass, 3 of Butter, 3 of Arrowroot, 3 of Sweets, 2 of Pickles, 2 of Vinegar, 3 of Mustard, 2 of Pepper, 2 of Gin, 1 of Ale, 1 of Brandy, and 1 of Whiskey, Of the Breads all were unadulterated, except one sample, which was found to contain alum in the proportion of 24 grains to the 41b. loaf. A conviction in this case was obtained, and the offender was fined £10 and costs. All the Milks were genuine but one sample, which was found to have been mixed with 13 per cent. of water. As it had not been sold as pure milk no proceedings were taken. Of the Coffees three were discovered to have been mixed with Chicory to a considerable extent, but as the samples were sold as mixtures, no action was taken. The other samples were free from adulteration, or contained no deleterious admixture. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. A. ROGERS, Medical Officer of Health, and Food Analyst.
