HAMP 2 1 8 9 5. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE Parish of St. John, Hampstead, For the Year 1894. BY EDMUND GWYNN, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. E. Mitcheuer, Printer and Stationer, 26, Eversholt Street, n.w. 1 8 9 5. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE Parish of St. John, Hampstead, For the Year 1894. BY EDMUND GWYNN, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Yestry Hall, Hampstead, N.W., 12th June, 1895. To the Yestry of the Parish of St. John, Hampstead. Gentlemen, I have the honour to lay before you my Annual Report upon the vital statistics of the Parish of Hampstead for the registration year, 1894. The ordinary sanitary statistics will, as before, be compiled for the parochial year, which terminated on the 25th March, 1895. The number of newly inhabited houses during the year was rather less than in former years, so that after making allowance for natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths, I estimate our population up to the middle of the year at 74,926. Marriages.—The number of marriages celebrated was 455, showing a decrease of 21 on the previous year. Births.—The births registered during 1894 were 1,472, or 23 less than in the previous year. The birth-rate was equal to 19"6, or somewhat less than that for the preceding year, which was 20.5. The birth-rate for London was 30.1 per 1,000 of the population. 4 Deaths.—The total number of deaths registered in the Parish was 1,323. Of this total 581 were deaths, within the district, of non-parishioners—chiefly occurring in hospitals— after the deduction of which, and the addition of 56 Hampstead parishioners who died in various Institutions outside the district, we get the corrected total of 798. These 798 deaths are equivalent to a death-rate for the year of 10.6. This remarkably low death-rate has only once been reached during the last twenty years, namely in J 888, when the death-rate was 10.5, but was nearly equalled in 1889, when we recorded an annual death-rate of 10.7. Comparing our death-rate with other London Parishes we find that with the exception of the Parish of Stoke Newington, we have the lowest death rate for the year in the forty-three sanitary areas. The rate for Stoke Newington was 9.8, but it must be remembered that the number of inhabitants of that Parish is barely equal to half that of Hampstead; Wandsworth and Lee registered 12.4; St George's, Hanover Square, 14.5; Islington, 15.9; St. Pancras, 18.3; Marylebone, 19.3; whilst in some districts in the East of London the numbers were as high as 24.7 in Limehouse, and 26.4 in St. George'sin-the-East. The death-rate for the whole of London was 174 per 1,000 of the population, and is stated to be the lowest recorded since the establishment of civil registration, nearly sixty years ago. Judging by the death-rate the year must bo considered to have been a very healthy one; nor are the causes far to seek, when we remember that the various epidemics of influenza in 1890, 1891 and 1892, had carried off many feeble and delicate lives, and that the cold and cheerless summer of 1894 had kept down the mortality from diarrhœa. 5 Mortality at Different Ages.—The deaths of children under one year were 167, or equal to 20 per cent. of total deaths, and 11 per cent. of total births. These figures show a rise on those for the preceding year, the rates for 1893 being 13.9 and 10 per cent. The rise was caused by an increase of mortality under the heads of premature birth, debility, whooping cough, and bronchitis. At 65 years and upwards there were 189 deaths, and of these, 62 died between 75 and 85, and 17 between 85 and 95, the oldest on the list being a builder, aged 91. Deaths in Public Institutions. North-Western Fever Hospital 455 Hampstead Hospital 15 St. Peter's Home 18 North London Hospital for Consumption 37 Friedenheim 76 Workhouse 66 Of these, 573 were non-parishioners; 18 parishioners died in the North Western Hospital; 7 in the Hampstead Hospital; 2 in the North London Hospital for Consumption ; 1 in St. Peter's Home; 1 in Friedenheim, and 65 in the Workhouse. Of the 56 parishioners who died in outlying Institutions, 43 succumbed in hospitals, 8 in asylums, and the remainder in infirmaries and other places. Special Causes of Death.—The deaths of parishioners from the seven principal zymotic diseases, after correction for those of our parishioners who died in hospitals outside our 6 district, are equal to a ratio of 14 per 1,000 living inhabitants, against a ratio of 1.3 for the preceding year; whilst that for London was equivalent to 2.6, aud for the Northern districts 2.3. The following table shows the diminution or excess of deaths in 1894 from the principal zymotic diseases .— Causes of death. 1891. 1893. Diminution in 1894 Excess in 1894. Small-Pox 3 2 — l Scarlet Fever 10 20 10 — Diphtheria 20 36 16 — Measles 31 1 — 30 Whooping Cough 26 6 — 20 Enteric & Typhoid Fever 5 8 3 — Diarrhœa 8 22 14 — Total 103 95 43 51 Thus, whilst under the headings of small-pox, measles, and whooping cough there has been an excess, there has been a diminution in scarlet fever, diphtheria, enteric fever, and diarrhœa. Small Pox.—Although this disease was not so fatal in London as in the previous year, still there were several marked outbreaks, particularly in the neighbouring Parish of Marylebone, which to a limited extent affected this Parish. Altogether we registered 17 cases, attended with 7 three deaths. The first fatal case—that of a clerk from Winchester Road—was removed to Hospital two hours after notification. He had been badly vaccinated in infancy. It Was ascertained that there were two unvaccinated children, aged 4 years and 9 months, in the house who had recently come from the country. They and the lodgers in the house Were vaccinated, and no further case occurred. An unvacciliated domestic servant, aged 26, was removed from Rosslyn Hill to Hospital and died there. Five cases occurred in one house in the Town Ward. The first case was thought by the medical attendant to be chicken-pox, and no precautions were taken ; four more cases became infected, attended by the death of an unvaccinated infant, 4 weeks old. The majority of the 17 cases reported were domestic servants, and in some instances it was established that they had paid Visits to the infected neighbourhood of Portland Town. With the exception of the infant already referred to, the whole of the cases were removed to hospitals. Scarlet Fever.—230 cases of this disease were registered against 512 for the previous year, and of these 144 were removed to hospitals. The fatal cases were 10, showing a diminution of 10 deaths over the preceding year; but the rate of mortality—somewhat above 4 per cent.—was rather higher. No difficulty was experienced in getting the cases received iuto hospitals, although no less than 11,767 scarlet fever cases were admitted into the Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals—equal to a weekly average of 226 throughout the year. Diphtheria was the cause of 20 deaths, showing a diminution of 16 compared with the preceding year. The total number of 8 cases notified in this Parish was 96, against 158 for 1893, the 20 deaths from (his cause being iu the proportion of 0.25 per 1000 living against a corresponding rate of 0 61 for the whole of London. Measles may be described as the principal epidemic of the year, and was very fatal in London, no less than 3293 deaths having been registered from this cause. The 31 deaths from this disease in Hampstead during 1894 stand in contrast with the single death from measles registered in 1893. The complaint was epidemic in the Town and Kilburn Wards, being chiefly spread by the agency of schools. The Workhouse was also attacked, and five children died in that institution from this cause. Whooping Cough caused 26 deaths against six for the preceding year. It was most fatal in the populous districts of the Kilburn Ward. Enteric and Typhoid lever.— 49 cases of fever were registered against 37 for the previous year, but the fatal cases were three less. It was clearly established in some instances that the disease had been imported from outside districts. It is certain that typhoid was epidemic in London during the close of the year, and most of our cases occurred at that time. No satisfactory explanation of the outbreak was arrived at, but there was some reason for thinking that the consumption of oysters that had been fattened in the estuaries of rivers, to the water of which typhoid poison had had access, had been a cause of the infection. Erysipelas.—67 cases of this disease were notified against 75 for the previous year, with fatal results in two cases. We are 9 frequently appealed to to remove cases of erysipelas, but, as a matter of fact, uo provision is made by the Asylums Board for the reception of erysipelas, and general hospitals are naturally very reluctant to receive these cases, the disease being liable to spread with fatal rapidity in surgical wards, so that in the long run they have to remain at home and be cared for as best they may. Five cases of Puerperal Fever were registered, two of which proved fatal. Diarrhœa was decidedly in abeyance in London, the deathrate from this cause being considerably lower than the average rate of the past 10 years. In Hampstead diarrhœa and dysentery combined caused only 8 deaths against 22 for the previous year. In accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board under the Public Health Act, Tables Nos. I. and II., annexed to this report, have been prepared. The first of these sets forth the population, births, and number of new cases of infectious disease which have come to my knowledge during the year 1894, and also the number of cases removed from their homes for treatment in isolation hospitals. No. II. shows the deaths which have been registered in the Parish, including also the deaths of parishioners in hospitals and other institutions outside the sanitary district, classified according to diseases, ages, and localities. The total number of certificates received during 1894 was 464, and the amount paid to medical practitioners for furnishing the certificates was £59 7s. This sum is recouped to the 10 Vestry by the Asylums Board out of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. The total number of cases removed to Fever Hospitals for treatment was 212. Influenza.—The deaths from influenza numbered 21, and these were recorded in every month of the year with the exception of April, July, and October. In December, 1894, and January, 1895, the disease assumed once more an epidemic form attended with considerable mortality. Although the total deaths in London from influenza during 1894 amounted to only 750, after having been 2336 in 1891, 2264 in 1892, and 1526 in 1893, yet there was no week in the year without some deaths from this cause, and it would almost appear as if this pest had taken a permanent place in our list of fatal diseases. Deaths from Influenza registered in Hampstead and in the Metropolitan Sanitary Areas in the five years 1890-1894. 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 London 652 2336 2264 1526 750 Hampstead 8 46 31 53 21 Local Diseases. — Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 112 deaths, of which 67 were due to bronchitis, 37 to pneumonia, and 8 to laryngitis and pleurisy. Diseases of the nervous system caused 57 deaths, including 34 from apoplexy, 6 from inflammation of the brain, 7 from 11 sions, and 3 from epilepsy. Heart diseases proved fatal to 63 and diseases of the digestive organs to 51 persons, which latter class includes 4 from dentition, 9 from enteritis, 8 from peritonitis, and 16 from diseases of the liver, together with those caused by habits of intemperance. Constitutional Diseases caused 166 deaths, including 50 from cancer (an increase of five on the preceding year), 65 from consumption (non-parishioners excluded), 14 from tubercular meningitis, 5 from rheumatism and gout, and 8 from diabetes mellitus. In the class of developmental diseases premature birth was the cause of 35 deaths, debility, atrophy and inanition of 16, whilst the deaths attributed to old age were 34, the deaths of aged people being frequently referred to other causes, such as bronchitis, &c. Inquests.—The number of inquests held was 69, an excess of 19 over last year, the deaths in 46 cases being caused by violence. Among the latter are included 2 cases of infanticide, 15 deaths from fractures, falls, and contusions, 5 from burns and scalds, and 3 from suffocation in bed with mother. Among the remarkable deaths from violence may be noticed the death a child aged 5 months by asphyxia by hanging, caused by the infant becoming suspended by the neck between the side and bottom of its cot; the death of two men, within a few weeks of each other, by breaking the neck, caused in each case by a fall down area steps, and the death of a boy aged 14, by being run over by a truck which he was drawing down Arkwright Road. The deaths by suicide were 14, or twice as many as in the preceding year, the means adopted being by drowning, 7; by gunshot wounds, 4 ; by wounds, 2; and by poison (carbolic acid), 1. 12 Work of the Sanitary Department. —Table III. contains the summary of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors during the year ending March 25th, 1895. Throughout the parish 2,931 houses and premises were inspected, and 5,162 re-inspections were made after order or notice. The number of notices issued for sanitary amendments was 1,159, or 428 less than in 1893. The total number of complaints received was 226, or 44 less than in the previous year, and the applications to examine the drainage of private houses was 195. The number of houses requiring cleansing, whitewashing, and repairs was 340; 356 house drains were repaired, trapped, &c., 226 ventilated, and 193 reconstructed; 154 new water-closets were ordered to be provided, 349 to be repaired, cleanscd, &c., and 55 ventilated. The paving of 105 yards was required to be repaired or new provided, 235 cisterns were cleansed, repaired, and covered, and 13 new provided; 151 orders were made to provide suitable receptacles for manure, and 68 for removal of dung, other refuse, and stagnant water. Overcrowding was abated in 11 instances, and 18 orders made for the removal of animals improperly kept. Houses unfit for habitation.— The premises 25, Elizabeth Mews were in January, 1895, certified to be unfit for human habitation, and subsequently closed by magistrate's order. It was necessary to take legal proceedings in 22 instances (against 17 for the preceding year) to enforce certain sanitary works, and orders were made for giving effect to the notices previously served on the defendants. 13 Cowsheds and Slaughter-houses.—In 1880 the number of cowsheds regularly inspected was 15, and the number of cows licensed between two and three hundred; now there remains but one cowshed, and that is licensed for 50 cows. The licensed slaughter-houses number 7, the same as last year, but in some of these comparatively little slaughtering is now carried on. These premises were visited by the Public Health Committee in October, besides frequent visits from Inspectors during the year. The several premises were mostly found in good order, but slight repairs and amendments were required in some instances, all of which were carried out before licensing day. The relative merits of private and public slaughter-houses was brought under the notice of your Vestry by the circular letters of the Board of Works for St. Giles and by the Maet and Cattle Trade Section of the London Chamber of Commerce. The St. Giles' Board expressed the opinion that slaughter-houses should not be allowed to exist in crowded districts in the metropolis, and suggested the establishment in place thereof of public abattoirs. Among other advantages a careful inspection of animals as to their state of health before slaughtering and the immediate and complete inspection of the carcases after death would be obtained. Exception was taken by the Meat and Cattle Trade Section, on the ground of expense, that the internal parts of animals provide a cheap article of food for the poor, which is only good when freshly slaughtered, that the abolition of private slaughterhouses would result in the whole live cattle trade of London passing into the hands of a few wholesale firms, and that 14 meat slaughtered in small quantities in private slaughterhouses keeps and looks better and is less handled than that slaughtered in public abattoirs. Having regard to the fact that comparatively little slaughtering of cattle takes place in this parish, especially in the neighbourhood of crowded districts, the Public Health Committee of your Yestry declined to support the opinion of the Board of Works for St. Giles. In connection with this subject may be noticed the issue of the Report of the Royal Commission "on the effect, if any, of food derived from tuberculous animals on human health, and if prejudicial, what are the circumstances and conditions with regard to tuberculosis in the animals which produce that effect upon men." Experiments were undertaken on a number of animals by adding either milk or uncooked meat derived from tuberculous animals to their ordinary food. Many of the animals became affected with tubercle, and the Commission draw general conclusions to the effect that there is ample evidence that food derived from tuberculous animals can produce tuberculosis in healthy animals, while there is no reason to suppose that the human race possesses any exception in this respect. The parts of an animal which are the most common test of tubercle are removed by the butcher in the course of preparation for the market; the flesh is seldom affected. It is known that the deposit of "tubercle" is caused by the invasion of a bacillus, first discovered by Koch, in 1882, and in man tubercle is commonly found in the lungs, resulting in consumption, and in the joints, glands and membranes of the brains of children. 15 Thorough and long-continued cooking is the best means of destroying the bacillus, but there is a danger that ordinary roasting and boiling does not raise the temperature of the interior of a large joint sufficiently high for that purpose. The greatest danger appears to be connected with the use of uncooked milk. Cows are liable to tuberculous diseases of the udder, and the milk yielded under these circumstances was found to be very dangerous and produced tuberculosis in all or nearly all of the numerous animals to which it was given. Fortunately for us, boiling the milk, even for a minute, has the effect of destroying the infective material. Bake-houses.—These now number 41 and are regularly inspected. The Factory and Workshop Acts and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, provide for the regulation of these premises as to cleanliness, ventilation, water supply and drainage, &c., but unfortunately the law does not prevent the construction of underground bake-houses. The Yestry of St. George, Southwark, proposed a conference as to the state of the law relating to bake-houses, and this conference took place in October. Certain resolutions were passed by a small majority after great opposition. The London County Council having the subject of the amendment of the law with reference to bake-houses, the framing of bye laws, and the issuing of licenses to use premises as bake-houses, under their consideration, your Yestry was of opinion that the matter might be best left in the hands of the County Council. Disinfection.—The number of houses disinfected after infectious disease was 371 against 602 for the previous year, and the number of miscellaneous articles, beds, &c., fell from 16 10,600 to 7,806. These figures show the decline in the epidemics of scarlet fever and diphtheria during the year. Unsound Food. — Articles of flesh, fish, and fruit, have from time to time been brought to the Vestry Hall and condemned as unfit for food. The inspectors have also visited the streets late on Saturday nights in order to prevent the sale of stale and unwholesome food. Mortuary.—65 bodies were received during the year, the number of post-mortem examinations upon these being 22; 18 bodies were brought in by the police, either the result of accidents or being found dead. The Coroner orders the removal of bodies for the purpose of inquest in many cases; very few bodies were deposited at the request of relatives of the deceased and no infectious bodies were received. Bye-laws as to houses let in loJgirgs or occupied by members of more than one family.—A circular letter was addressed by the Local Government Board to the Sanitary Authorities in 1893, pointing out that the powers conferred by the 94th Section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, differed in some respects from those exercisable under Section 35* of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and Section 47* of the Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874 (under which the regulations then in force in this Parish were made), inasmuch as Section 94 of the new Act "no longer provides that such matters as the enforcement of privy accommodation, the paving of premises, the notices to be given of infectious diseases, the cleansing of cisterns, &c., &c., shall be dealt with by regulations applicable to houses let in lodgings. These matters can be otherwise * Repealed by Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 17 dealt with, in some cases by Bye laws made by the Sanitary Authorities and applicable generally to all houses in the district, whether let in lodgings or not, and in others by Bye-laws made by the London County Council." The Board further enclosed a copy of a model series of Bye-laws which they had prepared for the use of Sanitary Authorities. A Sub-Committee was subsequently appointed by the Public Health Committee to modify our existing regulations on the basis of the model clauses. In January of 1894 a report of the Sub-Committee was brought up by the Chairman, Mr. J. Alexander, that they had considered the model Bye laws forwarded by the Local Government Board, and made various amendments, and suggested that the proposed Bye-laws under Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, should be approved and recommended to the Yestry for adoption, and that the necessary steps should be taken for obtaining confirmation thereof by the Local Government Board. Some objections were made by the Local Government Board, and the proposed Byelaws returned in September. These objections and modifications were further considered and reported on by the Sub-Committee, and the Bye-laws were finally approved and adopted by vour Vestry on November 29th, 1894, and subsequently allowed by the Local Government Board on the 17th of January, 1895. For the purposes of registering any house, fourteen days' notice must be given to the landlord to supply particulars as to (a) the total number of rooms; (6) the total number of rooms let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family; (c) the manner of use of each room; (d) the number, age, and sex of the occupants of each room; and (e) the amount of rent payable by each tenant. Any 18 information from the landlord why the house should not be registered, stated personally or in writing, would be considered by your Vestry. One frequent objection appears to be based on a mistaken supposition that, by registration, the registered house would become a "common lodging house," subject to police inspection, whereas the Regulations are only designed in respect to the sanitary condition of tenement houses. The new Bye laws provide for 300 cubic feet of free air space for each person exceeding ten years of age in each room used exclusively as a sleeping apartment, and 150 feet for each child under ten, and 400 cubic feet for each adult when the sleeping apartment is also the living room. The landlords are also called upon during the months of April or May in every year, or as often as it shall be necessary, to cause every part of the premises to be cleansed, and the ceilings and walls of rooms, staircases, closets, and passages, to be thoroughly lime-washed. Water Supply.—The subject of the inefficiency of the present limit of two-gallon flush for closets was more than once discussed by the Public Health Committee. It was considered that a three to three-and-a-half gallon flush was a desirable minimum, and it was further resolved by your Vestry that the London County Council should be urged to push forward with the steps they were taking for the amendment of Regulation 21 under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, in relation to water-closets, in which it is sought to increase the minimum quantity of water at each flush. 19 The relation of the Water Companies to the public has recently been much discussed, owing to the absence of water in houses during the severe frost of the early months of 1895, caused generally by the freezing of the service pipes, and also in some few instances by the freezing of the main. It would be very desirable that by future legislation the companies should be compelled to lay their mains at such a depth that they would be protected from frost, and that the communication pipes, over which the companies at present have no control, should be controlled by them. In his report on the chemical, physical, and bacteriological examination of water supplied by the Metropo'itan Water Companies during 1894, Professor Frankland states that the raw material drawn from rivers was much less favourable for the operations of the companies than in the previous year. The water derived chiefly from the Lea by the New River Company was almost invariably superior to the Thamesderived water of the West Middlesex Company. The proportional amount of organic elements in each of these waters, the average amount of these elements contained in the Kent Company's water during nine years ending 1876, being taken as unity, was as follows:— Sources. Maximum. Minimum. Average. Deep Well— Kent 0.8 0.5 0.7 River Lea— New River 2.4 1.0 1.6 River Thames— West Middlesex 7.7 2.4 3.9 20 The New River water was found clear and bright on twelve occasions, the West Middlesex clear and bright on ten occasions, and slightly turbid on two occasions. Electric Lighting.—From the hygienic point of view your Vestry is to be congratulated upon furnishing many parts of the parish with the electric light. It is to be wished that the use of the electric light were more generally adopted in our churches, chapels, and public rooms. The reprehensible habit of partially warming the former buildings by the burning of gas in cold weather is not infrequent, and certainly the stifling heat resulting from the free combustion of gas at evening services is often a source of ill health and distress to many people. Unless the Ventilation of a building or apartment in which gas is burnt be perfect, the results of the combustion can hardly fail to be prejudicial to those who breathe them, and in the case of young children may be most injurious; so that one may venture to express the hope that before many years have elapsed the electric light, with its obvious advantages, will have entirely superseded gas in private houses as an illuminating agent. It was considered by the Vestry that it was undesirable that the Parish should be left without the services of a Medical Officer during the vacation, having regard to the various important questions which might arise. I therefore take this opportunity of acknowledging my indebtedness to Dr. C. W. Cunnington for his supervision of the department during my necessary absence. Finally I have again to tender my thanks to the various officers of the Vestry for 21 the necessary information I may have required, and to the Public Health Committee and their Chairman for the assistance and support afforded me on many occasions in superintending the work of the department.
