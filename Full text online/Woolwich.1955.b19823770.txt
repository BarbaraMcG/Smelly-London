Wood 2 PREFACE To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting the Fifty-fifth Annual Report on the health and sanitary conditions of the Borough of Woolwich. The population of the Borough is now 148,500, a reduction of 1,200 compared with the previous year. The birth rate (13.2) has again fallen slightly apart from the year 1933, when the birth rate was 12.7, the 1965 figure is the lowest ever recorded in the Borough. The highest birth rate since the end of the last war was 22.8 in 1947. The adjusted birth rate for Woolwich was 13.06, compared with 15.0 for England and Wales, and 17.3 for London. The adjusted Woolwich death rate was 10.2, compared with 11.7 for England and Wales, and 10-8 for London. The principal causes of death during the year were heart disease 452 ; cancer 311 ; bronchitis 106; pneumonia 98, and accidents (all forms) 48, of which 16 deaths were due to road accidents. Falls among old people resulting in a broken leg are increasing. Three people were involved in accidents with pedal cycles, receiving fatal injuries. Of the total of 311 cancer deaths, 60 concerned men and 17 women with cancer of the lung or bronchus. There were 39 deaths of infants under one year, the same number as last year. Premature birth and associated conditions were responsible for 16 of the deaths, and broncho-pneumonia and bronchitis for 11 others. With regard to infectious diseases, the most prominent experience during the year was the outbreak of poliomyelitis, the worst in the history of the Borough. Altogether 127 eases were confirmed, half of them being paralytic. There were four deaths in this outbreak. There were nine cases where two members of the same family were affected. Whilst the seriousness of the effects of this disease must not be underestimated, only one quarter of the confirmed cases had any serious paralysis, and many of these have now made substantial recovery. I should like to pay tribute to all concerned for their help and co-operation, and particularly to the Brook Hospital, which bore the brunt of the cases, for their ready acceptance of cases and the excellent treatment facilities afforded. Both the Borough Council and the County Council continue to build much new accommodation in the Borough. Altogether during 1955, 157 dwellings, either in clearance areas or as individual unfit houses were represented to the Council as being unfit. After five years' working the Council have substantially completed their slum clearance programme formulated in 1950, and have now agreed to undertake a heavy programme of clearance in the Borough during the next five years. Proposals for the clearance and redevelopment of the Glyndon Road and Kirkham 3 Street areas are included in this programme, as well as the continued clearance of the St. Mary's area where the results of the Council's work during the past three or four years are now very evident. Satisfactory progress was made during 1955 by the Council in increasing the consumption of smokeless fuel in the Borough. The Council's decision to set up its first Smokeless Area means that tenants in Council accommodation in this area shall burn only smokeless fuel. The response has been good, and the results after a year's working are encouraging. The Council's tenants and other occupants of premises have co-operated extremely well. During the greater part of the year supplies of coke have remained good. Despite an increase in price, tenants generally soon become accustomed to burning smokeless fuel instead of coal and appreciate the extra benefits to be derived from this form of heating. Very few complaints have been received. The Council will be reviewing the working of this scheme in the light of experience gained during the last year. The attention of the Council and other statutory and voluntary workers in the Borough has been again directed to giving assistance to old people, of whom many in the Borough live on their own and have no relatives to give them daily help. The range of help given is wide, and this work is still expanding. The importance of getting the old people together and in a spirit of friendship and companionship is recognised. The local Darby and Joan Clubs and the Pensioners' Clubs play a valuable part in helping lonely old people. In addition, entertainment for old people is provided by the Council and by several voluntary bodies. Other voluntary help in the Borough includes the running of two Lunch Clubs ; the holiday scheme, which continues to prove very popular ; free transport on occasions ; bathing facilities ; and the important service of home visitation. The long awaited Food Hygiene Regulations were issued at the end of the year. Most of the Regulations became operative immediately, but the operation of certain provisions involving alterations to food premises or equipment were deferred until 1st July, 1956. The Regulations provide for the more hygienic handling of food, the cleanliness of food premises, stalls, apparatus and equipment. The requirement that food handlers must take reasonable steps to protect food from risk of contamination is a big advance in food hygiene legislation. The improved requirements for water supply should encourage both the cleanly preparation of food and the frequent washing of hands by the food handlers. The requirements of the new Regulations have been publicised in the Borough, and the co-operation of food handlers and food dealers obtained. It is appropriate to stress the value of continued publicity and education in this work, especially in the case of the food handler. Nevertheless, the Regulations are there to be invoked whenever necessary. Regulations can help considerably, but public opinion can do even more. If the public, and particularly the housewife, would always complain at the time and cease to patronise shops where breaches of sound hygienic practice are noticed quicker results would be apparent. In conclusion, it is my pleasing duty to thank members of the Health Committee and the Council generally for their support and kindly consideration throughout the year. I also wish to place on record the efficient manner in which the staff of the Department have carried out their duties at all times during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. STANDRING. 4 HEALTH DEPARTMENT STAFF Medical Officer of Health— t. standring, m.d., b.s.j d.p.h., m.r.c.s., l.r.c.p., f.r.s.h.

The number of live births registered in Woolwich during 1955 was 2,321. After correction for inward and outward transfers, the net number of Woolwieh live births was 1,971, being 64 less than in the previous year. Of the total births, 1,032 were boys and 939 girls. It is known that 1,762 births took place in public institutions in the Borough, of which 916 concerned Woolwich mothers. The birth rate was 13.2, which, when adjusted to allow for the differing age and sex distribution of the population in various parts of the country, gives a birth rate of 13.06 compared with the provisional birth rate for England and Wales of 15.0, and also for London of 17.3. There were 38 stillbirths during the year under review. Natural Increase in Population, (i.e., Excess of Births over Deaths). In 1955 the natural increase in population was 434. In 1954 it was 592, and in 1953 it was 521. Deaths. The number of deaths registered in Woolwich was, 1,397, and after correction for inward and outward transfers the net number was 1,537, giving a death rate of 10.3 for the Borough, compared with 9.6 the previous year. The adjusted death rate for Woolwich was 10.2, compared with the provisional figure of 10.8 for London and of 11.7 for England and Wales. Deaths of Woolwich residents in hospitals in the Borough totalled 449, whilst 428 died in other hospitals outside the Borough. Maternal Deaths. There were two maternal deaths during the year and one during the previous year. Inquests. Seventy-one inquests were held on Woolwich residents during the year, and 219 post-mortems on Woolwich residents were carried out on behalf of the Coroner. Infant Mortality. The infant death rate for the year was 19.7, compared with 18.1 in 1954 ; and 24.9 for England and Wales. Motor Vehicle Accidents. The total number of Woolwich road accidents during the year was 16, being six more than in the previous year. However, there were no road fatalities relating to children under 15 years of age during 1955. Seven of the persons concerned were over 65 years of age. Two of the cases related to persons who were struck by motor vehicles whilst riding pedal cycles ; an elderly woman was also struck by a pedal cycle and received fatal injuries whilst walking in the road, and a young man received fatal injuries when his racing car ran over the bank of a race track. Other Accidents. Deaths due to other accidents totalled 32, including 18 persons over the age of 65 years, mainly due to falls in or near the house, and in most cases resulting in fracture of the femur. There were three cases of drowning ; one of a child occurring at the seaside, and two of adults in the River Thames. There were also fatal injuries sustained by a number of persons whilst at work, including injuries received from a moving crane ; a fall by a steel erector from a Power Station roof ; a fall from a ladder into a ship's hold ; and fatal injuries received to the head when a man was struck by a falling load from a crane. Domestic accidents included electrocution received by an amateur when touching a wireless set, and shock from burns when elderly women's clothing became ignited (two cases). Marriages. There were 1,226 marriages in the Borough during 1955, of which 762 took place in Churches ; the remaining 464 took place at the Woolwich Register Office. Of the number of marriages which took place in churches in the Borough, Registrars of Marriages attended on 88 occasions. 7 Deaths from Cancer.

During 1955 the Sanitary Inspectors carried out 38,431 inspections, including re-inspections, being over 700 more than in the previous year, and nearly 8,000 more than in 1953. The nature of these inspections is shown in Table No. 8. As a result 1,406 intimation notices and 575 statutory notices were served. Complaints. There was again an increase in the number of complaints received during the year—3,460 compared with 3,048 in 1954, and 2,026 in 1953. Any necessary action was taken where complaints were made or nuisances discovered. Table No. 8. Inspections.

Legal Proceedings. During 1955 it was not found necessary to institute legal proceedings in order to obtain compliance with notices served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and other relevant Acts, Regulations and Bye-laws. Water Supply. The Borough is provided with a domestic water supply entirely by the Metropolitan Water Board, and samples of the water are regularly subjected to chemical and bacteriological examination by the Board at its laboratories. The condition of the water supply during the year was satisfactory both in quality and quantity. No complaint was received as to the quality of the water. Local industries are also supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and in addition supplies are taken from wells. Of the eleven wells known to exist in the Borough, seven are at present in use. The water from these wells is used for industrial purposes and fire-fighting. The Council's Baths at Woolwich and Plumstead each draw supplies from a well. Of the remainder, three in North Woolwich have been sealed off and one in Elthain has been replaced by a supply from the Metropolitan Water Board. Samples of the water were taken from the wells in use for bacteriological examination. The results showed the water to be satisfactory. Drainage. A total of 504 drainage defects were discovered during the year, and the Sanitary Inspectors supervised the necessary works of repair and reconstruction. Officers of the Department supervised 43 smoke tests on suspected defective private and combined drains, and 19 of these produced positive results ; 19 of the drains tested proved to be sound, and a further five tests which also produced positive results, were in respect of old disused drains which when exposed were permanently sealed off. A total of 131 combined drains were inspected and of these three were found to be defective. In these three cases, after the service of notices under Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the work of repair and reconstruction was carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department, the cost being apportioned among the responsible owners. Common Lodging Houses. During the last ten years there have been only two licensed Common Lodging Houses in the Borough, and at the end of 1954 the Common Lodging House at 60, Beresford Street, with accommodation for 60 men, was closed as a result of the Council's action in declaring the premises part of the Ropeyard Rails Clearance Area. There is now only one licensed Common Lodging House, that at 102 Woolwich High Street, which has accommodation for 22 men. During the year the Council renewed this licence following the carrying out of extensive works to make the premises fit for use for this purpose. Dustbins. The Sanitary Inspectors, in the course of routine inspections or as a result of complaints received from tenants, ascertained during the year that new dustbins were required at 109 premises. New dustbins were provided by the owners as a result of informal or formal action by the Department under the provisions of Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. No appeal to the local Magistrates' Court against the Council's action was made by an owner during the year. 14 Pet Shops. Twelve applications for the renewal of licences to keep pet shops within the Borough were approved. These premises are visited periodically by the Sanitary Inspectors to ensure that the requirements of the Pet Animals Act and the conditions subject to which licences are issued are being complied with. 76 such inspections were carried out during the year. Rag and Bone Dealers. The Public Health (London) Act, 1936, as amended by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1952, places restrictions, in the interests of public health, on sales by dealers in rags, old clothing and similar articles. During the year the Council instituted legal proceedings in respect of an offence against the Bye-laws made by the London County Council relating to the business of a rag and bone dealer. A police constable saw a man in a road in the Woolwich area offering toys, pocket knives, toy cameras, books, etc., to a number of children, all under the age of 15 years, in exchange for rags. A fine of forty shillings was imposed in this case. Rag Flock. Supervision of the hygiene and cleanliness of rag flock premises is one of the duties of the Sanitary Inspectors. There are three registered premises in the Borough where filling materials which are specified in the Rag Flock Regulations are used. During the year twelve samples of rag flock and other filling materials were obtained for analysis. Each sample was subjected to a number of prescribed tests, and satisfactory reports were received in respect of all the samples analysed. Six of the samples were of rag flock, three of woollen mixture, and one each of hair, millpuff and black curled fibre. During the year the Council renewed one licence for the manufacture of rag flock. Shops Act, 1950. The provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, relating to suitability of ventilation, lighting, washing facilities and sanitary accommodation and maintenance of suitable temperature in shops is the responsibility of the local sanitary authority. Altogether 1,103 visits of inspection were made by the Sanitary Inspectors for this purpose during the year. Hairdressers' and Barbers' Shops. Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, provides for the control by Metropolitan Borough Councils of Hairdressers and Barbers by their registration and the registration of their premises. Metropolitan Borough Councils have the option whether or not to operate these provisions. Having decided to operate these requirements, the Council are given power to make Bye-laws for securing the cleanliness of premises, towels, materials and equipment, and the cleanliness of persons employed at the premises. The Council decided to operate these provisions as from March, 1956, so that all persons carrying on the business of Hairdresser or Barber, and their premises, must now be registered by the Council. The provisions do not apply to a person carrying on a business solely at premises at which he resides where there is no shop or saloon, so long as he is not carrying on a business substantially as a full-time occupation or employing an assistant. Regular inspections of these premises are being made by the Council's Sanitary Inspectors. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. The registration and supervision of sellers of Part II poisons (i.e., other than registered pharmacists) is carried out by the Council under the above Act. The number of persons entered on the Council's list at the end of the year was 158. 15 Rodent Control. There were 908 complaints of rats and 414 of mice received during 1955, and in addition to the investigation of these complaints the systematic inspection under the " block control " system was continued. A total of 16,339 premises were inspected during the year and of these 12,975 were under the " block control " system. The number of properties found to be infested by rats or mice was 2,133 ; this included 171 business and industrial premises. Where the cause of the infestation appears to be due to defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is requested to effect the necessary repairs. In this connection the Department carried out 38 smoke tests on suspected defective drains at rat infested premises, and these tests produced evidence of 21 defective drains. One formal notice, under the provisions of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, was served on an occupier of a house in New Eltham, to remove a quantity of garden rubbish which was harbouring rats. A total of 24 " block control " schemes was carried out during the year. As in previous years the Council continued its practice of arranging free treatment in respect of infestations in private dwellings. A charge is made for treatment carried out by the Council at business and industrial premises. With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer's Department, two sewer treatments and one test baiting were undertaken during 1955, and in this way the number of rats in the sewers has been kept under control. The number of " takes " recorded at the December treatment showed a 14 per cent, fall on the previous treatment. Mosquitoes and Other Pests. During the year a number of complaints were received from various parts of the Borough of infestations of cockroaches, moths, crickets, silver fish, etc. Advice was given in each case, and, where necessary, treatment was carried out. Two infestations of cockroaches were dealt with by the Department during the year for which charges were made. One of these infestations occurred in a Borough Council establishment. At the request of the Director of Housing, infestation of woodworm was treated by the use of Hydrogen Cyanide in the Department's specially equipped pantechnicon. The pantechnicon was also used to carry out the Hydrogen Cyanide treatment to two three-piece suites. Charges totalling £22 4s. lOd. were made upon the responsible persons for the treatments referred to above. During 1955 several complaints of wasps nesting in houses or gardens were received and in seven cases the Department destroyed the nests. Charges totalling £7 10s. 5d. were made upon the occupiers of the premises concerned. Factories Act, 1937. Table No. 10. Details of Inspections carried out during 1955 are as follows Premises.

The last return of outworkers made by employers of labour in the Borough and by other local authorities shows that this type of work has increased considerably. There were 252 outworkers listed in the last return for 1954, compared with 504 this year. This increase is due mainly to the expansion of one firm in the Borough which specialises in providing " work at home." The nature of the outwork is as follows :— Type of Work. Number of Workers. Wearing Apparel 122 Lampshades 349 Stuffed Toys 17 Household Linen 14 Box Making 1 Making of Curtains and Furniture Hangings 1 Over 87 per cent. of these outworkers are employed by local firms, and the remainder by firms throughout the country from such distant places as Yeovil and Bradford. Local industry also employs 128 outworkers who live outside the Borough. The Council's woman sanitary inspector visits the homes of outworkers periodically to ensure that the working conditions are satisfactory, 409 such inspections being carried out during 1955. Old People's Welfare. During the year particular attention was again paid by the Borough Council to the problems of the aged to help mitigate the unsatisfactory conditions in which some of these elderly people are found to be living. The co-operation of voluntary bodies interested in the welfare of old people is an important factor, and in order to co-ordinate this work the Council are in close liaison with the General Practitioners, the County Council, local hospitals and the Woolwich Council of Social Service, and other voluntary bodies. 17 The Council's Old People's Welfare Visitor made a total of 3,475 visits to the homes of aged persons during the year, compared with 2,716 visits in 1954, and 2,520 visits in 1953. In addition to the greatly increased number of visits which were made, it was possible for her to spend more time with each person than hitherto. It was not necessary during the year to invoke the special procedure laid down by the National Assistance Act for the compulsory removal to a suitable home of an elderly person found to be in need of care and attention. However, a number of elderly persons were considered to be in need of special attention and were persuaded to enter an old persons' home or hospital for treatment without recourse to the statutory provisions. Cleanliness of Old People. Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953 in any case where an aged person is found to be verminous or is in need of cleansing in order to prevent injury or danger of injury to health and is so feeble that he is unable to avail himself of any facilities for cleansing himself, the Council may cleanse the person concerned, with his consent, free of charge, at his home or at a Cleansing Station. During the year arrangements were made for the cleansing of 22 such persons in their own homes, in cases where the old people were unable to cleanse themselves, because of their frailty and due to lack of suitable bathing facilities at the home. Holidays. The holiday scheme for old people in the Borough was again very popular, and by means of these arrangements 86 old persons living in the Borough were able to have a holiday during the year. Forty people went away in the month of May, two in June, and 44 in August or September. Holidays for six other persons were arranged through the Women's Holiday Fund. The detailed arrangements of this scheme were again made by the Woolwich Council of Social Service with the help of a grant from official sources. Seventy-seven of the visitors stayed at guest houses at Westgate. Of the total applications for holidays only seven could not have a holiday during the year. Almost all parties travelled by coach to and from the resort. A grant to the holiday scheme to enable some disabled old people to have a special holiday was made during the year. Such a holiday entails extra expense for accommodation with the provision of nursing and other care, and also the cost of ambulance transport through the auspices of the British Red Cross Society. The patients and their families often provided a large part of the cost for such a holiday, but sometimes there was difficulty in finding the whole amount, and the Woolwich Council of Social Service suggested to the Council that the sum of £25 a year might be reserved to help meet the cost of holidays for these paralysed and disabled old people. The Council readily agreed to this suggestion, and as a result seven persons were able to have a holiday during the year at various seaside resorts. Letters of thanks have been received from several old persons who went away during the year. Lunch Clubs. The Plumstead and Eltham Lunch Clubs operated fully throughout the year. Meals for the Plumstead Lunch Club are supplied from the Borough Council's restaurant at the Plumstead Baths. On the 1st January the supply of meals to the Eltham Lunch Club was obtained from a local caterer, instead of from the County Council's Eltham High Street restaurant which closed at the end of 1954. The Borough Council continue to make a substantial grant to the Woolwich Council of Social Service towards the running costs of these two Lunch Clubs. Workrooms for the Elderly. During the year the Council considered the possibility, with the financial assistance of the Employment Fellowship, of establishing in the Borough a scheme for the employment of elderly persons. The Council were interested in such a scheme as it enabled elderly persons, within the limits of their reduoed working capacity and in good conditions, to give some useful service to the community. The scheme would not be self-supporting, but would be valuable in providing congenial occupation for elderly people. 18 It was reported that a similar scheme was operating successfully in two other London Boroughs where the work is provided mainly by local manufacturers as " hand-outs," the operations being adjusted as far as possible to meet the needs of each worker. The Health Committee considered this matter in some detail, and invited the views of the Old People's Welfare Committee, who reported that they were of opinion that such a scheme would be valuable in preserving the health in body and mind of elderly people, although it was recognised that the scheme would not be economical and would be limited in its appeal. They fully supported the establishment of a pilot scheme in the Borough, preferably in the lower Plumstead area. Some apprehension was felt by representatives of the National Federation of Old Age Pensions Association, who thought that old people should not be asked or expected to go on working after retirement age, although it was explained that the scheme was " occupational therapy " rather than " work." Whilst the scheme would undoubtedly be of benefit to the old people from the community point of view, in view of the initial cost and the problematical response which the Woolwich Council of Social Service had ascertained, after careful consideration the Council decided that no further action be taken for the time being. Burial of the Dead. During the year the Council made arrangements for the burial of five deceased persons under the provisions of Section 50.of the National Assistance Act, 1948, where it appeared that no other suitable arrangements were being made for their burial. The total expenses in these cases amounted to £46 15s. 0d., of which £21 5s. 6d. was recovered by the Council from the Estatea of the deceased persons. Public Houses. The supervision of the hygienic conditions in public houses is an important duty of the Health Department. There are 148 licensed premises in the Borough, 36 of which also serve main meals. 177 inspections were made during the year, and as a result 47 defects were found requiring the service of 17 informal notices and two formal notices. All these defects were subsequently remedied. Excellent co-operation continues to exist between the brewery companies and the officers of this Department, which has resulted in the maintenance generally of a good standard of hygiene in both premises and equipment. It was necessary during the year to serve three informal notices and one formal notice in respect of the insanitary conditions which were found in the urinals attached to the public houses. Theatres and Cinemas. The routine inspection of the sanitary accommodation, etc. at all the cinemas in the Borough was continued during the year. The standard of cleanliness remained satisfactory, and it was only necessary in four instances to serve informal notices. Street Cleansing. Each main thoroughfare is cleansed daily, secondary roads twice weekly, and district roads once weekly. There are 86 street sweepers employed on the work and, in addition, a mechanical sweeper and sprinkler is used to sweep the roads in the shopping areas adjacent to Powis Street, Plumstead High Street and Eltham High Street. Over 9,000 street gullies are cleansed periodically by mechanical gully-cleansing machines. Recording and Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution, 1955. During the year monthly readings of the amount of sulphur and deposited matter (grit) collected at the five stations set up by the Council for measuring and recording air pollution were maintained. The Public Analyst conducts the detailed analyses and the results are made available to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The results of the monthly readings during 1955 were as follows :— 19 20 Table No. 11. Measurement and Recording of Atmospheric Pollution. January.December, 1955. Station.

During the year under review, 47,094 tons of refuse were collected by the Council's vehicles and 55,508 tons disposed of at the Council's Refuse Destructor. The difference between the two weights is largely the quantity of refuse delivered to the Refuse Destructor from the Royal Arsenal and Army Barracks. Material salvaged during the year amounted to 1,976 tons at a value of £8,777. Public Conveniences. Sixteen conveniences for men and a similar number for women are maintained throughout the area, hours of opening and closing varying with local requirements. In the town centre, for example, the conveniences are open from 5.30 a.m. Normally, however, this service is available between the hours of 6.30 a.m. and 11 p.m. These conveniences were inspected regularly throughout the year. In all the conveniences water closets are now free. Free Washing Facilities—Public Conveniences. The Council has, for the past four years, provided free washing facilities at main public conveniences. This service continues to be used and appreciated by the public although some people still prefer the paid washing facilities which include the supply of a linen towel. The number of paper towels used during the year was 55,000. The information regarding Street Cleansing, Refuse Disposal, Public Conveniences and Free Washing Facilities has been kindly supplied by the Borough Engineer. Tents, Vans and Sheds—Bye-laws. The administration of Bye-laws made by the Borough Council in respect of tents, vans and sheds is the responsibility of the Department, and a total of 131 inspections of these types of dwellings was carried out. Public Baths and Washhouses. The Council has four bathing establishments in the Borough. A full description of this service, which includes swimming baths, slipper baths, Turkish Baths, public laundry, and the use of the premises for social and sporting activities during the winter months, was included in my Annual Report for the year 1952. During the year improvements were made in the Public Laundry service at Plumstead Baths, and two 25 lbs. capacity washing machines and four modern hydro-extractors were installed. This new facility has been much appreciated by the public, and it has been necessary to extend the hours of opening to meet the demand. The Laundry is now open from 7.30 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. Monday to Friday, and from 7.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. on Saturdays. The charge for the use of a washing machine was fixed at 2s. Od. for half-an-hour, which is sufficient time to wash 25 lbs. dry weight laundry, and the charge for the use of a hydro-extractor was fixed at Id. In view of the demand for this service, it is hoped that two more washing machines of similar type can be installed during 1956. The Indoor Cricket School at Eltham Baths again had a very successful season. The outstanding feature of last season was perhaps the Kent County Cricket Club's Coaching Scheme for schoolboys which was held there for the first time, and which it is proposed to continue next season. Early last year the plant at the Woolwich Baths was converted from coal burning to oil burning, with a consequent reduction in operating costs of more than £1,000 a year. In view of the success of this project the work of converting the plant at the Plumstead Baths has been put in hand, and should be completed by September, 1956. The Chief Administrative Officer of the Baths Department has informed me that during the twelve months ended 31st March, 1955, there was an increase of 3,198 compared with the previous year in the total number of attendances. Attendances during that period were as follows :— Swimming 422,085 Slipper Baths 143,710 Turkish Baths 10,250 Public Laundry 9,650 Free Baths to Old Age Pensioners and Unemployed Persons 4,139 21 Swimming Bath Water. During 1955, 58 samples of swimming bath water were taken from the Council's public baths at Woolwich, Plumstead and Eltham. These samples were submitted to the Park Hospital, Hither Green, for bacteriological examination. All the samples proved satisfactory. The Department carried out simultaneously its own tests for free chlorine and hydrogen-ion concentration (pH value). I set out below details of the samples of water taken. Baths. Number of Samples taken. Number of Bacillus Coli. per 100 ml. Average pH value. Average Free Chlorine. Average Temperature. Woolwich 22 0 7.7 1.53 74.7 Plumstead 20 0 7.3 1.9 74.8 Eltham 16 0 7.83 1.77 74.6 Boating and Paddling Pools. With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer, the regular chlorination of boating and paddling pools was continued throughout the year. Pool attendants add chloride of lime to the pools each evening in quantities prescribed, to give an estimated free chlorine content of 0-15 p.p.m. Sufficient washing soda is also added to maintain a pH reaction of 8-0. In addition, the pools are scrubbed out weekly with chloride of lime paste. The results of these measures has been a consistent improvement in the purity and appearance of the water. Frequent tests made by the Department showed that the water was maintained at a reasonable standard of purity. HOUSING Repairs. At the end of 1955 there were estimated to be 41,956 dwellings in the Borough. The number inspected for housing defects under the Public Health or Housing Acts was 7,452 (compared with 7,365 in 1954) and 1,406 houses were found to be not in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. Some 1,038 houses were rendered fit by informal action by the Sanitary Inspectors. This informal action included the service of intimation notices. In 566 instances it was necessary to serve statutory notices in order to ensure the carrying out of the requisite work. House-to-house inspections under the Housing (Consolidated) Regulations, 1925, were continued, the total number of inspections in 1955 being 2,247. Overcrowding. During the year eight families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions, and reports were made to the London County Council on behalf of these persons. In two cases the County Council provided other accommodation. A further 193 families were visited after complaints of overcrowding or at the request of the London County Council or the Borough Council Housing Departments. Reports were sent to both Housing Departments setting out details of the applicants' present accommodation. Upon application being made by either landlord or occupier, the Council are under an obligation to give in writing a statement of the permitted number of persons in respect of any dwelling house, and measurements of dwellings for this purpose were taken on 111 occasions, compared with 319 in 1954. 22 Individual Unfit Houses. Twenty-five houses (compared with 17 in 1954) were represented by me during the year as being unfit for human habitation and incapable of being made fit at reasonable expense. Formal notices were served on the owners under the provisions of the Housing Acts to secure the demolition or closure of these houses, and the Council subsequently made Closing Orders in respect of the following 18 houses, and Demolition Orders in respect of the remaining seven houses :— Closing Orders : 180, Plumstead High Street 61, Kirkham Street 69, Kirkham Street 16, Gavin Street 127, Abbey Wood Road 21, Morris Walk 22, Morris Walk 57, Prospect Vale 1, Morris Placc 42, Raglan Road 20, Wilmount Street 21, Merchland Road 99, Prospect Vale 25, Glenside Road 21, Church Hill 20, Woolwich Church Street 12, Brookhill Road 128, Ann Street. Demolition Orders : 29, Marshall's Grove 30, do., do. 31, do., do. 83, McLcod Road (hutment) 59, Beresford Street 15, Woolwich High Street 242, Woolwich Church Street. A further seven individual unfit houses had been represented to the Council at the end of the year, for demolition or closure. During the year the Council made Closing Orders in respect of unfit rooms at a further eleven premises. The following are details of the parts of houses closed by the Council during the year :— 75, Eltham Road 29, Majendie Road 26, Reidhaven Road 118, Rectory Place 12, Woolwich Common .. 26a, Passey Place 17, Fennell Street 11, Saunders Road 31, Woolwich Common .. 118, Woodhill 11, Passey Place First floor front, middle and back rooms Basement back room and basement scullery. Basement front and back-addition rooms. Basement rooms. Basement front and back rooms. Basement rooms. Basement rooms. Basement rooms. Basement rooms. Basement rooms. Basement front and back and basement scullerv rooms. During the year the Council determined a Closing Order made in 1937 in respect of the basement rooms at 17, Milward Street, on being satisfied that these rooms had been made fit for habitation. A Closing Order in respect of 40, Samuel Street was also determined on the satisfactory completion of works by the owner to make the house fit. During the year I represented to the Council that the dwelling house 139, Eglinton Road was unfit for human habitation but capable of being made fit at reasonable expense. Notices under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936 were served, and subsequently the Council, in default of the owner, made these premises again fit for habitation. Improvement Grants. The number of inspections under the Housing Act, 1949, relating to applications for Improvement Grants, considerably increased during the year and totalled 222. 23 SLUM CLEARANCE Clearance Areas. The Council's programme of properties in the Borough scheduled to be cleared during the years 1950-55 was substantially completed by the end of the year. The total number of properties involved in this five-year programme was nearly 600. Details of the action taken by the Council during the year are as follows :— Thrift Cottages (Frances Street Area). This area, comprising five dwelling houses (1-5 cons. Thrift Cottages), had been represented by me on the 6th April, 1954 for clearance, and was subsequently declared by the Council to be a Clearance Area. The Council's Clearance Order was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the 31st March, 1955. Eustace Place (No. 1 Area). I represented, in 1954, that this area, comprising 16 houses, should be dealt with for clearance. The Minister of Housing and Local Government held a Public Inquiry in respect of this area on the 19th April, 1955. Objections had been made by the owners of Nos. 17 and 18, Borgard Road, 25-31, 32 and 33-38, Eustace Place. The Minister confirmed this Clearance Order on the 15th June. Eustace Place (No. 2 Area). This Area, comprising ten houses (3-12 cons., Limbrey's Buildings) was represented to be dealt with for clearance in 1954. The Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed the Council's Clearance Order, without modification, on the 15th June, 1955. Greenlaw Place (No. 1 Area). This Area, comprises twelve houses, the number of occupants totalling 35. The Council declared the area to be a clearance Area in November, 1954. In September, 1955, the Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed the Council's Clearance Order without modification. Greenlaw Place (No. 2 Area). This Area comprises the following dwelling houses : 25-47 (odd) Kingsman Street, which I represented to the Council as unfit in October, 1954. The number of occupants was 36, and the Council's Clearance Order was confirmed by the Minister during 1955. Greenlaw Place (No. 3 Area). This Area consists of 97 dwelling houses, and was represented by me during 1954. The Council's Clearance Order was confirmed by the Minister in September, 1955, subject to modifications which involved the exclusion of No. 290, Woolwich Church Street, and Nos. 36 and 38, Church Hill from the Clearance Area ; also 41 properties which the Council had already acquired by agreement had been excluded from the Order. Greenlaw Place (No. 4 Area). There are only two houses in this area, and the Council's Clearance Order was confirmed by the Minister during 1955. Samuel Street (Nos. 1-5 Areas). At the end of the year I represented to the Council that the houses comprised in the following five areas were unfit for human habitation and should be dealt with as Clearance Areas :— No. 1 Order : 71-83 (odd), Samuel Street 87-119 (odd), Samuel Street 129-141 (odd), Samuel Street 71-113 (odd), Frances Street. No. 2 Order : 39-43 (odd), Samuel Street 49-67 (odd), Samuel Street 66-78 (even), Frances Street 117-125 (odd), Frances Street 129-151 (odd), Frances Street 25-31 (cons.), Chapel Hill 24 33, Chapel Hill 2-6 (cons.), Harrington Buildings. No. 3 Order : 15 and 17, Samuel Street. No. 4 Order : 3-9 (odd), Samuel Street. No. 5 Order : 25-35 (odd), Samuel Street. The land affected is all contained in the St. Mary's Comprehensive Redevelopment Area. It is proposed to build on the site some 270 new dwellings, the majority of which will be in the form of blocks of flats. About 138 families will be displaced from the five Clearance Areas. In addition, there are some " added " properties which will be required to be purchased by the Council in order to develop the area adequately. Slum Clearance Programme, 1956-60. During the year the Borough Council, in consultation with the County Council, agreed on a substantial slum clearance programme to be undertaken in the next five years. The total number of properties in the Borough scheduled to be dealt with by the end of 1960 is 1,112, of which 554 will be dealt with by the Borough Council. This figure does not include some 100 individual unfit houses which are solely the responsibility of the Borough Council. Scheduled in the Borough Council's programme for early clearance and redevelopment are 190 properties in the Glyndon Area. Eighty-five of these properties were part of the County Council's 1955 programme before transfer to this Council. Another large area to be cleared and redeveloped by the Borough Council is the Kirkham Street Area, Plumstead, comprising 59 properties. Among the areas to be dealt with by the County Council is the Glenalvon Place Area, Woolwich, comprising approximately 150 properties. Certificates of Disrepair. Under the provisions of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, the landlord of a property may, subject to certain conditions, increase the rent of the property. If the tenant of a house, after receiving notice of an increase of the rent is of the opinion that the house is not in a good condition, he may at any time apply to the local authority for a Certificate of Disrepair. A total of 32 such applications from tenants for the issue of (Certificates of Disrepair, following service of notice by the landlord, were dealt with during 1955. Five of these applications were refused, the conditions at the premises concerned not being sufficiently serious to warrant the issue of a Certificate. In addition, 24 applications were received from owners for the revocation of Certificates of Disrepair. The Health Committee on being satisfied that all the work listed on the Certificates of Disrepair had been satisfactorily carried out, revoked 18 of these Certificates, the remaining six applications being refused as the work had not been completed satisfactorily. During the year the Council also issued eleven Certificates of Disrepair to tenants under the provisions of the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts, the houses in question not being in a reasonable state of repair. A further three applications for such Certificates were refused, the conditions at the premises not being sufficiently serious to warrant the issue of such a Certificate. Housing Progress, 1955. The number of dwellings built in the Borough of Woolwich during the year 1955 may be summarised as follows :— By the Borough Council 213 By the London County Council 79 By the Housing Association 75 By private enterprise 65 Total 432 25 In addition, at the end of the year, a further 254 dwellings were under construction by the Borough Council. Further progress was made in 1955 in the St. Mary's Comprehensive Development Area. Since the scheme commenced, 261 families have been rehoused from the area, and 183 new dwellings erected since building commenced in September, 1953. Further schemes are in hand, and in addition plans have been approved for the first stage of the shopping centre. The redevelopment of the hutment area at Abbey Wood has continued and only 25 of these hutments remained occupied at the end of the year. One scheme for 128 new dwellings has been completed, a second scheme for 76 dwellings is under construction, and a third scheme for 124 dwellings is in preparation. The development of various smaller sites in the Borough has continued, and in addition a start has been made on three further schemes on the Coldharbour Estate, totalling 136 dwellings which, when finished, will complete the development on this Estate. At the 31st December, 1955, there were 8,920 tenancies in property owned or controlled by the Council, of which 702 were in Requisitioned Properties. There were 3,732 applications on the Housing Register at the end of the year, compared with 4,291 at the end of December, 1954. The information regarding the housing progress in the Borough during 1955 has been kindly supplied by the Director of Housing. HEALTH EDUCATION Film Programmes and Informal Talks. During 1955 a full programme was again undertaken by the Council's Health Education Unit which regularly visits local organisations in their own meeting place and presents informal talks and sound films and film strips dealing with health and allied subjects. Altogether, 84 film programmes were presented during the year to audiences totalling 4,800 persons. In addition, nine informal talks, mainly dealing with home safety, were presented, and during a period of six weeks in the months of February and March, at the time of the visit to the Borough of the Smoke Abatement Mobile Exhibition, a number of sessions were arranged dealing with smoke abatement at which films were presented at meetings in various parts of the Borough. The film "Guilty Chimneys" was shown extensively during this campaign. So far as the film programmes were concerned, the largest audiences by far were met with at old people's meetings, where all meetings comprised audiences of over 100 persons, and over 300 persons were present at one of these sessions. As in past years, one film usually of 20-30 minutes' duration dealing with a health subject was presented, this being augmented by shorter films of general interest. All film showings are of approximately one hour's duration, the informal talk preceding the showing of the film. Of the 84 film programmes presented, 12 were given to old people's meetings, 27 to mixed adult audiences, including professional bodies, ten to youth gatherings and 35 were at afternoon meetings held by local women's organisations. Therefore, it will be seen that these programmes are given to a good cross-section of the community, and if in turn audiences pass on to other members of the family something of what they have learnt at these sessions, the value of this service is apparent. Smoke Abatement and Air Pollution Publicity Campaign. During the months of February and early March, the Council, in conjunction with the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, organised a publicity campaign devoted to smoke abatement and the prevention of air pollution. The inaugural meeting was held at the Town Hall on the 31st January, with His Worship the Mayor as Chairman, and with Sir William Steward, Member of Parliament for West Woolwich in support. The first part of the evening was 26 devoted to short speeches by Councillor G. E. Offord, Chairman of the Health Committee ; Dr. White, Medical Officer of Health, Corporation of London, and Mr. Ludgater, Manager of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation. The second part of the evening took the form of "Any Questions" ; there were six members on the panel each representing an aspect of the problem. Mr. Wynford Vaughan Thomas, the B.B.C. commentator, acted as Question Master. Questions which had been submitted in advance by members of the public were asked from the floor of the Hall. The audience, which numbered approximately 250, included many members of the Council, representatives of interested organisations, officers of this and other local authorities, together with residents of the Borough. A fortnight prior to the inaugural meeting at the Town Hall, letters, together with posters and invitation cards provided by the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, were sent to over 250 voluntary organisations throughout the Borough. Questions for submission to the Quiz Panel at the inaugural meeting were invited. This advance publicity was also made available to all local public utilities, Chamber of Commerce, and local fuel merchants. The Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation advertised in the local press the details of the five weeks' campaign ; all departments of the Council co-operated in the display of posters, and the Libraries Department in particular distributed over 4,000 invitation cards. The Sanitary Inspectors called on many local shopkeepers and obtained their co-operation in the display of posters and the distribution of invitation cards. On Friday, the 28th and Saturday, the 29th January, a van equipped with public address equipment was hired and toured the Borough giving public announcements of the inaugural meeting. The Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation mobile exhibition which toured the Borough formed an attractive display of four of the more common approved appliances installed in fireplaces and burning smokeless fuel. Displayed also were samples of all the smokeless fuels, together with literature explaining their use. Demonstrators were in attendance during the time the exhibition was open to give advice to the public. The exhibition was staged at nine different sites in the Borough, commencing on the 31st January, at Beresford Square and subsequently travelling to and opening at Borgard Road, Plumstead Common, Well Hall, Abbey Wood, Eltham High Street, Coldharbour Estate and Eltham Green. Over 6,000 people visited the exhibition and 15,000 booklets on smokeless fuels and appliances were issued by the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation. Coinciding with the opening of the exhibition in various parts of the Borough local public meetings were held in halls adjacent to the sites. Each meeting was given advance publicity in the local press and written invitations were distributed to over 1,000 households in the vicinity of the meeting place. The Chairman of each meeting was a Borough Councillor representing the Ward concerned, and supporting him were the Chief Sanitary Inspector, the Council's Smoke Inspector, and Mr. Ludgater of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation. The meetings opened with the film "Guilty Chimneys," a copy of which had been purchased by the Council. Questions were asked by members of the public and lively discussions on the problem took place. Possibly due to the very cold weather with snow the meetings were not well attended ; however, what they lacked in numbers was made up by the interest of those who did attend. A local firm kindly offered shop premises at the corner of Thomas Street and Wellington Street for use by the Council free of charge, and this offer was gratefully accepted. The Council, in conjunction with the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, converted the ground floor of the shop into an exhibition, and an Information and Advice Centre. An attractive window display was made by the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation consisting of typical tiled fireplaces fitted with modern approved smokeless fuel appliances of all types. Furniture, carpets and models were supplied by a local firm to complete the window display. The interior was set up as an exhibition, which included working models on loan from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Meteorological Office. The models comprised a temperature inversion unit which showed very efficiently the effects of the change of air temperature in the production of smog, and a volumetric deposit gauge, a daily recording instrument and lead peroxide instrument. These are 27 standard instruments used by the Council for the measurement of air pollution Samples of stonework collected locally which had suffered considerable damage from atmospheric pollution were also on display. The Centre was staffed by the Health Department from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday to Saturday, for the period commencing 24th January until Friday, 25th February. During this time 650 members of the public visited the Centre and made enquiries on smokeless fuel and approved appliances. Both the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation and the Council considered that the campaign was well worth-while, even allowing for the fact that at the time of the Exhibition there was some of the worst weather experienced for some years, which affected the size of audiences. Smoke Abatement Exhibition, Autumn, 1955. The Council's Smoke Abatement campaign was continued during the week commencing 26th September with the autumn Smoke Abatement Exhibition at the Town Hall, organised by the Health Department, which was opened by Sir Hugh Beaver, Chairman of the recent Government Committee of Inquiry into Air Pollution. At the opening ceremony, in addition to Sir Hugh, the Mayor had the support of the Chairman of the Health Committee and other members of the Council. Numerous enquiries were received during the week from persons wishing to fit approved domestic appliances and these were dealt with by experts of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, and the Gas Board and the Electricity Board, who supported the Health Department as exhibitors. Questions on particular fuel problems were also dealt with. The Housing Department also gave valuable support, a feature of their stand being scale models of typical Borough Council houses and the types of grates used therein. The National Smoke Abatement Society exhibit also attracted attention. On the Health Department stand a wide range of industrial smoke prevention equipment had been installed, together with the latest measuring instruments in use by the Fuel Research Station. A number of guided parties representing local organisations and schools attended the Exhibition during the week. A feature of the week was a successful poster competition arranged by the Department. Local schools were invited to participate and 48 entries were received. The posters were of a high standard and were judged in their age groups of 12 years, 13 years and 14 years ; the six winners each receiving book tokens to the value of one-and-a-half guineas. The opening of the Exhibition had been preceded by an intensive advertising campaign, some 18,000 leaflets being distributed in the Borough by means of houseto-house delivery, via public offices, local organisations and shop-keepers. Slides were shown at three Eltham Cinemas during the week prior to the Exhibition, and the staff of one of the local cinemas distributed leaflets. An advertising banner was hung in Powis Street, and details of the Exhibition were sent to local organisations and to factory managements. The Exhibitors received numerous enquiries from members of the public interested. In this respect, as the Exhibition had as its aim helping to make Woolwich more Smoke Abatement conscious and increasing the interest of householders, local property owners and factory management in this work, it no doubt achieved its purpose. Leaflets and Literature. During the Council's smoke abatement campaign, thousands of leaflets dealing with the subject were distributed in all parts of the Borough, and on the occasion of the visit of the Mobile Exhibition to various parts of the Borough numerous invitation cards were distributed to houses in the vicinity of each meeting place. Again, during the Smoke Exhibition at the Town Hall, thousands of leaflets and pamphlets calling attention to the benefits to be derived from the use of smokeless fuels and the installation of approved appliances were distributed. 28 As in past years, 500 copies per month of the booklet, " Better Health " were made available to members of the public during the year and were distributed through the Council's Libraries and other public buildings, and at the Health Education sessions. The two large poster sites in Woolwich were used for the display of posters obtained from the Central Council of Health Education. As in past years the Council made a contribution to the funds of the Central Council for Health Education. Home Safety. At the end of the year the Council approved the issue of a second edition (comprising 3,000 copies) of a Home Safety Booklet to be presented by the Health Committee of the Council for local distribution. Three thousand copies of a first edition of this booklet had been distributed during the previous year. The booklet contains a Foreword by His Worship the Mayor, and an introduction drawing attention to the tragic loss of life and the injury and suffering caused by accidents in the home. Much useful information on the prevention of home and industrial accidents is to be found in the booklet. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Premises where Food is Prepared and Offered for Sale. A total of 3,427 inspections of food premises was carried out during the year. Details of the registered food premises at the end of 1954, together with the number of inspections carried out during the year, are as follows:— Table No. 12. Description. Number in Borough on 31st December. Number of Inspections. Dairies 1 16 Distributors of Milk 166 350 Ice Cream Premises 322 944 Premises where Meat is Potted, Pickled, Pressed and Preserved. 111 162 Premises where Sausages are Manufactured 95 173 Premises where Fish is Cured or Prepared for Frying 40 107 Wholesale Dealer in Margarine 1 4 Restaurants, Cafes and Snack Bars 204 643 Industrial & School Meals Service Canteens.. 92 257 Markets 1 Daily Bakehouses 27 50 Itinerant Vendors.. — 24 Non-registered Premises .. .. .. — 378 Greengrocery and Fruit Shops — 142 Public Houses 148 177 Milk Supply. Within the Borough there was at the end of the year one dairy and 138 registered distributors of milk. The Council also approved registration of a further 28 distributors of milk who sell in this Borough from premises outside. 29 226 dealers' licences and 73 supplementary licences were issued under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949, which authorised the use of the special designations " Pasteurised," " Tuberculin Tested " and " Sterilised." Samples of milk were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis during the year. The percentage content of fat was:— During 1955, 169 samples of "Pasteurised" or "Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised" milk were subjected to the Methylene Blue test at the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, to assess the keeping quality of the milk. All the samples were reported to be satisfactory. A further 172 samples of "Pasteurised" or "Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised" milk were submitted for the Phosphatase test to determine the adequacy of pasteurisation. All of the samples were reported to be satisfactory. Eighteen samples of "Sterilised" or "Tuberculin Tested Sterilised" milk were submitted to the Park Hospital for the Turbidity test and satisfactory reports were received in each case. The tests referred to above are those prescribed in the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949. Continuing the practice carried out for many years in this Borough, 97 samples of milk were obtained in the early hours of the morning during deliveries to schools, hospitals and institutions in the Borough. 37 of the samples were submitted for the Phosphatase test, 37 for the Methylene Blue test and 23 for chemical examination. Routine visits to milk distributors were carried out during the year. Defects at twelve milk premises were found, notices being served upon the responsible persons to remedy these defects. Non-Registered Food Premises. The Sanitary Inspectors continued throughout the year to pay periodic visits to all non-registered food premises. The majority of shopkeepers were willing to co-operate in order to maintain a good standard of hygiene. A total of 378 inspections were made and as a result, 177 defects were found which required the service of 20 informal and two formal notices. Review of Milk Regulations. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Ministry of Health are at the present time reviewing the existing Regulations relating to milk premises and distributors of milk, these Regulations having been in operation for the past five years. The Ministries are considering representations which may be made from all interests concerned, in order to frame amendments with the object of making consolidating Regulations. The Council were asked during the year for their observations on the working of the present Milk Regulations, and submitted the following suggestions for consideration by the Ministries:— (a) In view of the number of Dairies which are now producing orange drinks, consideration might be given to an amendment to existing Regulations to permit the bottling of this type of drink within a dairy, with a provision, if necessary, that the section of the plant so utilised is used solely for that purpose ; (b) A large number of small general shops in this Borough are licensed to sell Pasteurised and Sterilised milk. The sale is always of the bottles exactly as received from the producers, and is a small part of the main sales of the general shops. Such licences have to be renewed annually, but the Council suggested that consideration might be given to prescribing a longer period of licensing than at present, say for three years, in respect of such sales. Number of Samples. 4.5 per cent. and over 4 per cent. and under 4.5 per cent. 3.5 per cent. and under 4 per cent. 3 per cent. and under 3.5 per cent. Below 3 per cent. Nil 11 98 78 1 30 Ice Cream. There were 322 registered ice cream premises in the Borough at the end of the year, of which six premises were used for manufacture and seven for the storage of ice cream. The majority of the dealers sell pre-packed ice cream only. Routine visits are made to all the premises, and during the year some 35 defects were found and remedied. Eight informal notices and one formal notice were served. The premises of each new applicant for registration are inspected in order to ensure that they are satisfactory and that the requirements of the Heat Treatment Regulations are fully understood. During the year ten samples of ice cream were submitted to the Laboratory for grading by the Methylene Blue test. The results of the tests indicated that eight of the samples were in Grade I, one in Grade II, and one in Grade III. Meat Inspection. A total of 42,016 carcases were inspected at the Garland Road Abattoir during the year. Slaughtering is carried out daily and the meat is inspected immediately after slaughter by three of the Council's Sanitary Inspectors specially qualified in this work. The slaughter of horses is not carried out at this Abattoir. There was a considerable drop in the number of animals passing through this Abattoir during the year, mainly due to the increased consumption in this country of imported frozen and chilled meat as distinct from home-killed animals, The following table gives details of the types of animals slaughtered and inspected during the vear 1955. Table No. 13. Carcases and Offal Inspected and Condemned in Whole or in Part, 1955. Cattle, excluding Cows. Cows. Calves. Sheep and Lambs. Pigs. Horses.

Of the two licensed slaughterhouses in the Borough one is not being used at the present time. Ten slaughtermen's licences were issued to slaughtermen working at the Plumstead Abattoir, permitting them to slaughter sheep, pigs, calves and cattle only. All the applicants were experienced slaughtermen. Itinerant Vendors. Surveillance of street traders in the Borough continued throughout the year. A good standard of cleanliness was maintained in respect of these vehicles. In two instances it became necessary to serve notices in respect of vehicles which were not displaying the name and address of the trader. Catering Establishments. The improvement of conditions in restaurants, cafes and canteens in the Borough was continued, and more work was done under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspectors to improve standards prevailing, particularly the kitchen accommodation. A total of 643 inspections of restaurants and cafes, and 257 of factory and school canteens were made. The occupiers of the majority of the catering establishments continued to be co-operative and showed willingness to improve the facilities and conditions of their premises. It was, however, necessary in 22 instances to serve informal notices requiring work to be carried out, and in six cases this was followed by a formal notice under the Food and Drugs Act. Some 130 defects were remedied during the year. In no case was it found necessary to institute legal proceedings. Basement Bakehouses. The owners of two basement bakehouses in the Borough, namely, those at 31, Vincent Road and 15, Woolwich New Road, S.E. 18, informed the Council during the year that they had discontinued baking at these premises and did not intend to use the premises as bakehouses again. In these circumstances the Council have now withdrawn the Certificates of Suitability issued under Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937 ; these Certificates having been renewed each succeeding -five years since 1938. Unsound Food : Examination of Food Suspected of Being Unsound. The routine examination of food suspected of being unsound was carried out throughout the year in order to ensure that no food unfit for human consumption was sold or displayed for sale. The co-operation of the food traders is, of course, very important in this matter, and numerous requests are received from traders for an inspection to be carried out of suspected foodstuffs, and a large amount of food is surrendered as unfit for consumption and Condemnation Certificates issued. Altogether, 24,336 articles of food, weighing approximately 62 tons, were condemned as unfit during the year, the majority of these articles, weighing approximately 50 tons, being from the large Abattoir in the Borough. Complaints of Unsound Food. During 1955, 46 complaints regarding food were received. The majority of these referred to foreign bodies in food. There were 12 such complaints which related to bread, seven to milk, four to cakes and pies, two to sweets and chocolates, and three in respect of tinned foods. The alleged foreign bodies complained of included glass, string, metal bolts, pins, stones, wood, flies, worms and maggots. The bakers responsible were in each case warned. The Council decided to send warning letters to the suppliers of the food in eight cases, and in two further cases, concerning glass found in chocolate and metal found in bread, the Council decided to institute legal proceedings. Costs totalling £10 10s. Od. were awarded to the Council in respect of these cases. 32 The presence of oil and oiled dough in bread again caused several complaints to be made. A further 17 complaints were received during the year of food sold in unsound condition, and of food contaminated by rodent excreta. The majority of the articles of food complained of were found to be genuine, for example, alleged unsound saveloys, corned beef, meat pie, lemon squash, and cheese. It was necessary in only six cases for further action to be taken. Where the cause of complaint was justified, the food preparing premises were investigated by the Council's Food Inspectors and the food handlers concerned were advised. Food Sampling, 1955. During the year ended 31st December, 1955, 823 samples (i.e., 608 informal and 215 formal samples) were submitted for analysis to the Public Analyst. Of these, 12 formal and 30 informal samples were reported to be adulterated or otherwise not complying with the statutory requirements, giving a percentage of 5.0 compared with 3.8 in 1954 and 3.2 in 1953. No private samples were examined during the year. The following table gives details of the adulterated samples:— Table No. 14. Sample Article. Formal or Informal. Result of Analysis. Action taken. 666 Scotch Shortbread Mixture (Sugar Sweetened). Informal Contained no fat. Shortbread ordinarily contains a substantial proportion of fat. Formal sample obtained. 719 Scotch Shortbread Mixture. Formal do., do. Manufacturers warned. 640 Luncheon Meat Informal Contained meat 53 per cent. sulphur dioxide 130 parts per million.

Infectious diseases notified to the Department are visited by the Sanitary Inspectors at the earliest opportunity and disinfection is carried out wherever applicable. Where the patient is nursed at home, Sanitary Inspectors visit to see that home isolation is carried out satisfactorily, and at the end of the infectious period the bedding, etc. belonging to the patient is removed for treatment at the Disinfecting Station and the rooms sealed and fumigated. Food Poisoning. During the year there were four small outbreaks of food poisoning in the Borough, of which three were of undiscovered cause. In one small outbreak a box of chocolates was thought to be the cause of the trouble. Three members of the family who had eaten from the box of chocolates on the Sunday evening became ill during the early hours of Monday morning. The source of supply of these chocolates was investigated but no cause found. A local retailer of this particular brand ceased his sale for the time being. In another case where four members of the family were ill it was found that the father had probably introduced the disease as a carrier. Salmonella organisms were isolated in the case of two of the children, aged two years and nine months respectively, who became ill on the 14th of the month, and another child became ill ten days later and was removed to hospital. It was not possible to trace the suspected food. The parents were not ill. Another small outbreak concerned three members of the Armed Forces stationed locally, who were taken ill after dining in the same mess. All three had complained of abdominal pains. The suspected source of infection was pork pies. The remainder of the food in question had been destroyed. The three patients were removed to hospital. Malaria. Four of the six notified cases of Malaria concerned members of the Armed Forces who had recently returned from abroad. One case was later diagnosed as Tonsilitis. Puerperal Pyrexia. Altogether 94 cases were notified during the year, of which 21 concerned mothers whose homes were outside the Woolwich area who had been confined in hospitals in Woolwich. Only three of the notified cases had had home confinements. 37 38 Table No. 15. Notification of Infectious Diseases (excluding Tuberculosis), 1955. Diseases.

The two-year cycle of Measles was again apparent, 2,985 cases occurring in the Borough during the year, compared with 54 in the previous year and 1,051 in 1953. Half of the total cases were in the age group 5-9 years. It was necessary for 108 of the patients to be admitted to hospital because of complications or due to inadequate home nursing. The percentage of patients admitted to hospital was, however, only 3 per cent. of the total cases notified, compared with 45 per cent, in the year previous. Diphtheria. Once again the Borough was entirely free from diphtheria, none of the six notified cases being confirmed. The revised diagnoses was Tonsilitis (3), Pneumonia (2) and Glandular Fever. Poliomyelitis. The epidemic of poliomyelitis in the late autumn and early winter ended just before Christmas. The cases were predominantly from the Plumstead area, although there was some move towards Woolwich as the epidemic progressed. Eltham remained relatively unaffected apart from a slight increase at the end. There was a total of 202 cases notified during September to December, inclusive. Of these a total of 127 were confirmed as poliomyelitis ; 63 paralytic and 64 non-paralytic, the biggest yearly total in the history of the Borough. The age group 5 to 9 years contained the most cases, namely, 68. The next group was 1 to 4 years with 35 cases. Alt-hough for a number of years polioyelitis has belied its old name of infantile paralysis, in previous years there has been a rather greater incidence in adolescents and adults than in this epidemic. Previously more than one case in one family was rare, but a recent trend for such eases to occur has been well illustrated in Woolwich. There were eight families with two cases each. In no instance was there more than two cases in one family. In respect of the County Council Rest Centre, Plumstead High Street, there were six eases occurring during November. Altogether 185 patients were dealt with at the Brook Hospital. During this outbreak there were four deaths from the bulbas form of the disease, but fortunately only 54 of the other paralytic cases were paralysed to any considerable degree; the remainder either recovering fully or having very little remaining paralysis as not to interfere to any material extent with ordinary life. The 64 non-paralytic cases, of course, fully recovered. While poliomyelitis must be regarded as a serious disease and tragedies must occur, the above figures again show that the final outcome is by no means invariably gloomy. Of the total of 127 confirmed cases in the recent epidemic, 92, or 73 per cent. have made full recovery so far as the normal activities of life are concerned. Tuberculosis. The number of primary notifications of tuberculosis (154) was a decrease of 46 on the previous year's total. There were 23 deaths in the Borough attributed to tuberculosis against 21 the previous vear. Table No. 16. The following is an extract from the Tuberculosis Register for 1955:— Pulmonary.

Duties regarding investigation and treatment are carried out by the local Chest Clinics, which are situated at Maxey Road, Plumstead, and at Carnegie Gardens, Eltham, being administered by the Regional Hospital Board. Disinfection and Disinfestation. During 1955 the Department carried out disinfection of 406 rooms after cases of infectious diseases, and of these 33 rooms had been occupied by tuberculous persons. Altogether, 1,375 inspections regarding verminous conditions were made and 450 rooms were disinfested for vermin. 29 van loads of furniture were fumigated during the year. Many requests were again received from residents in the Borough wishing to dispose of bedding and furniture which was often in a dirty and sometimes verminous condition. This bedding and furniture was in the main that formerly used by persons removed to hospitals or institutions, or deceased. The articles were removed to and destroyed at the Plumstead Destructor. There were 91 such cases dealt 40 with during the year and a total of 223 articles were removed and destroyed. Of these articles, 61 were mattresses, 14 bedsteads, 34 sets of bedding, 48 items of furniture and 66 other sundry items. Six requests were received from residents for the disinfection of rooms, bedding or furniture following the occurrence of a non-infectious disease, or the death of a member of the family. Charges totalling £2 15s. Od. were made for this work. A number of countries impose a condition that a Certificate of Disinfection must accompany any parcel of clothing entering the country. During the year several residents having relatives in Eastern Europe requested disinfection of clothing, which was usually new, and five certificates were issued in respect of such clothing, which had been disinfected by the Department. Charges totalling £1 5s. Od. were made for this work. A local firm of clothing exporters asked if the Council would disinfect large quantities of clothing before export to Africa. Four consignments of clothing were disinfected during the year and charges of £17 were made for this work. Personal Cleansing. The personal cleansing stations are situated adjacent to the Turkish Baths, Plumstead High Street, and at Eltham Hill Health Centre, Sherard Road. The number of persons cleansed in 1955 was 774, and the number treated for scabies was 53. Authentication of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. Persons proceeding abroad are required to produce in certain countries evidence of recent successful vaccination or inoculation. The signatures on these certificates are not acceptable by the countries concerned unless authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health as being the bona fide signature of a doctor practising within the area. During the year, 336 certificates were authenticated by me. Of these 305 were in relation to smallpox, 21 to cholera and 10 to typhoid fever. LABORATORY FACILITIES A large part of the Council's pathological and allied work in relation to the diagnosis, prevention and control of infectious diseases is undertaken at the Southern Group Laboratory at the Park Hospital, Lewisham. This service is provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service on behalf of the Medical Research Council. Specimens sent to this laboratory include samples of milk and ice cream, samples of food in suspected food poisoning cases, specimens of meat from the Abattoir and samples of swimming bath water. The following summary relates to the work carried out by the laboratory on behalf of the Council during 1955:— 41 Details of the number of cases dealt with at the two Cleansing Stations are as follows:— Pre-School Children. School Children. Adults. Total. Boys Girls Boys Girls Men Women Treatment op Verminous Persons— Number of Cases 4 33 205 449 18 65 774 Treatment of Scabies— Number of Cases 5 10 6 9 7 16 53 Food (including animal specimens from abattoirs, whole bovine blood and blood plasma) 37 Ice Cream (methylene blue test) 7. Milk (methylene blue, phosphatase and turbidity tests) 362 Milk bottles 6 Faeces 11 Water (from swimming baths, children's paddling pools, boating lakes and from domestic supply) . 81 Total 504 The examination of specimens of human origin (mainly swab examinations) for the general practitioners in the Borough, and also specimens referred to the hospital from local clinics, is undertaken by the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee. The work was formerly carried out at the Memorial Hospital laboratory, but is now being undertaken at the Brook Hospital and at St. Nicholas Hospital. General practitioners referred ten sputum specimens for examination and the hospital carried out 113 other sputum examinations during the year. Twenty-eight nasal and throat swabs were referred to the hospital by general practitioners for examination. Metropolitan Bououob of Moolwtcb T. STANDRING, M.D..
