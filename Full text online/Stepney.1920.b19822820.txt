Sharp, Vice-Chairman. A REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOB, THE YEAR 1920. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting to you my twentieth Annual Report, which deals with the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Borough of Stepney for the year 1920. Population. The population estimated by the Registrar-General is, in my opinion, too low. The population at the Census of 1911 was 279,801. At this period there was a great deal of empty property, but in 1920 very few empty houses existed in the Borough of Stepney, and no habitable house remained unoccupied for any length of time. Allowing that a certain number of houses have been converted into business premises, and some common lodging houses are now utilised for other purposes, 270,000 is in my opinion a fair estimate. This figure is confirmed to a certain extent by the number of ration books issued from the Local Food Office. It is difficult to understand how the population of Stepney has been reduced by nearly 15 per cent., which is the case if the figures of the Registrar-General (242,000) are to be accepted. I have estimated the birth-rate and death-rate on the assumption that the population at the middle of the year was 270,000. Births. The total number of births during the year was 7,347—3,676 males, and 3,671 females, or 1,884 more than in the previous year. The birth-rate was 27.2 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was 26.5 per 1,000. 1,996 of the births belonged to the Limehousc District. 1,176 of the births belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 3,119 of the births belonged to Mile End Old Town. 1,056 of the births belonged to the Whitechapel District. There was an increase in the number of births in each of the four districts 81 illegitimate births and 182 still births were notified during the year. A 2 4 Marriages. The total number of marriages was 2,774. The proportion of persons married was nearly 20.5 per 1,000 of the population. 566 of the marriages were registered in the Limehouse District. 352 of the marriages were registered in St. George-in-the-East. 1,287 of the marriages were registered in Mile End Old Town. 569 of the marriages were registered in the Whitechapel District. Deaths. After deducting the deaths of non-residents who died in the Borough, and adding those of residents who died in Outlying Institutions, the total number was 3,479—1,901 males and 1,578 females, or 148 more than in the previous year. 773 of the deaths belonged to the Limehouse District. 582 of the deaths belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 1,323 of the deaths belonged to Mile End Old Town. 801 of the deaths belonged to the Whitechapel District. The death-rate was 12-8 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was 12-4 per 1,000. Notifiable Diseases. 4,014 notifications were received and 3,421 were removed to various fever hospitals and infirmaries. 946 belonged to the Limehouse District. 716 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 1,620 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 732 belonged to the Whitechapel District. Wrong Diagnosis. 99 cases of Infectious Disease were removed to hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, which were subsequently returned home, in consequence of the patients found not to be suffering from the diseases stated on the certificates, or any other notifiable disease. 56 of the cases were notified by private practitioners, 34 from the London Hospital, and 9 from other Public Institutions.

She is then referred to a Health Visitor who reports as to the home conditions and who assists the woman in making the necessary preparations for her confinement. 2.—Maternal and Infant Welfare Centres.—About ten days after the birth of tne child, the mother is visited and advised to take her baby to the nearest Centre which may be either a voluntary or a municipal one. The baby is weighed and the doctor and Health Visitors in attendance advise the mother as to health, hygiene and feeding. 3.— Health Visiting.—There are twelve Municipal Health Visitors who do the primary visiting for the whole Borough and who refer each case to the Centre serving that particular district. The subsequent visiting is then undertaken by the Centre and thus overlapping is avoided. The Health Visitors also do the subsequent visiting of all children attending the Municipal Centres, and of all children under five years of age. In addition to giving lectures on practical subjects to the mothers at the Centres, the Health Visitors also visit and report upon all cases of still-births and upon Ophthalmia Neonatorum throughout the Borough, 4.— Hospitals and Convalescent Homes.—Cases in urgent need of treatment are sent to hospital, mainly to the London Hospital and to the East LondonHospital, Shadwell. Those needing skilled home nursing are referred to the East London Nursing Society, the Borough Council having an arrangement with the Society for the nursing of such cases. Nursing mothers and their babies, the wives of unemployed ex service men who would benefit by good air and food are sent to the Lady Forster Guest House at Sydenham. Toddlers from two years of age and upwards who are convalescent are sent to the Marjorie Lumley Home, MaidenheadDelicate babies in urgent need of skilled nursing are now referred to the Babies' Nursing Home, 587, Commercial Road. 15 The following is a iist of Centres, Clinics and CrSches in the Borough :— I.—Municipal Centres. 1.

Their employment by Voluntary Associations in the Borough have not proved a success, due to the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of the right sort of persons to undertake the work. The matter was carefully considered, and it was referred to a Sub-Committee to prepare a scheme. The Sub-Committee, after due consideration, submitted two alternative schemes (a) Maternity Helps ; (b) Home Helps on lines laid down by the Ministry of Health. The Maternity Committee carefully considered these two schemes, but the members were divided in their opinion as to the merits of each of the two schemes, but after slightly modifying the former, it was adopted, and approved by the Council. The Ministry of Health, however, were not prepared to approve the scheme submitted, but were prepared to consider a proposal on the part of the Borough Council to organise a service of Home Helps whose duties should be purely domestic as laid down in their Circular, and should not include any work which properly belongs to the sphere of a trained nurse or midwife. Supply of Milk under the Maternity and Infant Welfare Scheme. The Council commenced giving milk to nursing and expectant mothers and to children under five years of age in 1918 by granting £10 to the Stepney School for Mothers. 17 During the first nine months of 1919 the Committee granted milk to 14 applicants only. In October, 1919, the Committee had under consideration, a communication from the Ministry of Health, impressing on local authorities the necessity of making full use of the powers which they had under the orders of the Food Controller, and the Maternity and Child Welfare Act, to secure that mothers and young children were not deprived of the necessary supply through the increase in price of milk, and intimating that the Committee should consider whether any extension of the arrangements were required. The Committee decided to ask the Borough Council to authorise them to incur expenses of a sum of £100 for this purpose. At their meeting in November, 1919, the Committee had again under consideration a communication from the Ministry of Health, and at that meeting it was decided to recommend the Council to increase the sum to £500 a year. At their meeting tne following month the Committee recommended that milk should be given to 78 new applicants and the renewal of 16 cases. At their meeting on 30th December, 1919, the Committee considered the conditions under which milk was given. Where the combined income of a family, after deducting the rent paid, worked out at a rate of 7s. 6d. or under per head per week, milk was given free, after enquiries had been made, and the figures given were verified. The Committee, after consideration, were of the opinion that the amount of income per head should be increased from 7s. 6d. to 15s. It was further resolved to take steps, by means of handbills and posters, to bring to the notice of all concerned the facilities provided by the Council for obtaining free supplies of milk for nursing and expectant mothers and children under 5 years of age. These recommendations were adopted, and 50,000 handbills with 2,000 large posters were distributed throughout the Borough early in February, 1920. It had the immediate effect on the number of applicants as is evident by the table given below. I informed the Committee towards the end of January that £400 of the £500 granted by the Council had been spent, and on 27th January the Committee resolved to raise the amount to £3,000 per annum. The Ministry of Health drew the attention of the Committee to the large and increasing expenditure incurred, and at their suggestion it was resolved to ask the Ministry to receive a Deputation for the purpose of obtaining the Ministry's approval to the arrangements for the supply. As a result of two visits to the Ministry of Health, the following revised scheme was adopted, and is in force at the present time:— B 18 Scale for Distribution of Free Milk. No. in Family. Free. Half-price. After deduction of Rent. s. d. s. d. 1 Expectant mother 16 0 18 0 2 Expectant mother and husband, or mother and child 13 0 14 6 3 Husband, wife and child, or mother and 2 children 10 6 11 6 4 As above 9 6 10 6 5 „ 8 6 9 6 6 „ 8 0 9 0 7 „ 7 6 8 6 8 „ 7 0 8 0 9 „ 6 6 7 6 10 „ 6 0 7 0 11 „ 5 6 6 6 12 „ 5 0 6 0 13 „ 4 6 5 6 That is, milk is supplied free if the income does not exceed 16s. per week after deducting the rent where there is only one in the family, such as an expectant mother. The scale is 13s. after deducting rent if there are two in the family, etc. Milk is not supplied in excess of 3 pints to any one family unless there are special circumstances warranting it. It is not supplied to expectant mothers before the seventh month of pregnancy unless specially recommended. All possible steps are taken to verify incomes by communicating with the employers. We also inquire whether milk is supplied by other bodies, e.g., as the Board of Guardians, Charity Organisation Society, Pensions Committee. We obtain the information through the Registrar of Mutual Assistance and not directly through the abovementioned bodies. The milk is not supplied before investigation is made except in cases of emergency, when it is supplied for a period not exceeding a week. The form is scrutinised and checked by a second clerk before it is signed by the clerk in charge. The approximate quantity of milk distributed together with the cost was:— Jan. 20 gallons a day was given to 125 persons at a cost of £105 a month.

The permit was made out for 28 days and renewed. No period was fixed as to the number of times the permit should be renewed. Steps were taken to ensure that the recipients received the proper amount of milk from the milk vendors, and that it was not adulterated. As far as the measure was concerned, there was no ground for complaint. The genuineness of the milk was not satisfactory and where the milk vendor was a frequent offender under the Food and Drugs Acts, his name was struck off the list of suppliers. Unfortunately there is a growing tendency on the part of the larger milk vendors to rely on the warranty when their milk is found to be adulterated. I presume the smaller tradesmen are not supplied by the wholesale firms with warranties, as it is very seldom produced when such retailers are prosecuted for milk adulteration. The Public Health Committee have on many occasions called the attention of the Borough Council and of the Local Government Board to the fraud perpetrated with impunity by dishonest tradesmen under the cloak of the Warranty Clause. The Warranty defence has been pleaded successfully in this district by milkmen for milk adulteration during the last 7½ years on 100 occasions, while the number dismissed from all other causes has only been 14. For substances other than milk, the Warranty Clause has been successfully pleaded in 3 instances, and the number of cases dismissed for other reasons has been 4 during the same period. With regard to milk, the wholesale firm cannot be successfully prosecuted for having sold adulterated milk to the retailer. It is necessary to take proceedings for " giving a false warranty." The only facts that the wholesale firms have to prove are that they have a warranty from the farmer, and that the milk was not adulterated while in their possession, nor had the firms any reason to believe that it was not genuine milk when received. If proceedings are taken against the farmer, the latter will state that he delivered the milk as the cow gave it, and all his employees who have handled the milk will give evidence that they did not adulterate it. The Magistrate will then have no option but to dismiss the summons. The Warranty does not appear to be a bom fide one as drawn, as it is only given for the purpose of evading the Food and Drugs Acts, and it could not be sued on by the retailer in the Civil Courts for a breach thereof. B2 20 One glaring instance of the abuse of the Warranty Clause is worth repeating. It is that of a milkman residing in our district, who was convicted 17 times— 11 summonses were for adulteration, 5 for refusing to serve the Inspector with milk and 1 summons was for obstructing the Inspector. On the latter occasion, the Inspector actually saw him adding water to the milk, and when he demanded a sample from the mixture, the milkman tried to upset the can. A struggle ensued and most of the milk was spilt, but sufficient remained in the can to be analysed. This was divided into three parts in the ordinary way, and it showed 22 per cent, of added water. He was prosecuted on several occasions after this occurrence, and although convicted several times, the summonses were dismissed on a Warranty on 6 occasions, once when the milk showed 21 per cent, of added water. I am glad to state that this milkman will not defraud the public in our district in a similar way again. He was caught red-handed deliberately adding water to milk. I reported the matter to the Local Food Committee and was instructed to prosecute him under the Milk (Amendment) Order, 1917, No. 1317. He was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, and his brother, who was assisting him in the transaction, to three months, and his name was removed from the register of milk sellers. The reason I remind you of this case is to show how easily a dishonest milkman can evade the Act by pleading the Warranty Clause. His past history is not taken into consideration, nor is the fact that he is continually pleading this defence. In many cases where the milkman has often successfully pleaded the Warranty Clause, the Public Health Committee in the past, in considering the report as to whether proceedings should be instituted or not, decided that no action should be taken, well knowing that it would be waste of time and money to do so. The Warranty Clause is intended to protect the honest tradesman; but it is a pity that no provision is made to protect the general public against the fraudulent trader. The Warranty Clause was inserted in the Act to protect the honest trader. From that point of view it may be useful, but the honest trader if he suffers an injustice, from the unlawful acts of the wholesale dealer and his servants or the farmer, has his remedy, but the defrauded general public has no remedy at all when the Warranty is abused so flagrantly as it is at present. At the present time, with the law as it is, a dishonest milk vendor, after obtaining a Warranty from the wholesale firm, can sell adulterated milk with impunity. An appearance at the Police Court when he is caught is no deterrent, as he is confident of the case being dismissed. The Milk and Dairies Bill, 1915, in my opinion, should be immediately put in force and the Ministry of Health should make such orders under it as it may think advisable to put an end to the scandal that now exists. 21 It seems extraordinary that the defunct Ministry of Food had greater powers in dealing with the sale of milk than the Borough Councils, Ministry of Health or the Board of Agriculture, but that the Ministry of Food did not exercise its powers may be gathered from the following incident.—A dairyman was cautioned twelve times and prosecuted fifteen times for selling adulterated milk, one sample containing 23 per cent, of added water. The summonses were dismissed on four occasions, the warranty defence being successful. In 1919, he was prosecuted on two occasions for selling milk containing 35 and 56 grains respectively of boracic acid per gallon. On the latter occasion he was fined £50 and costs. In June, 1920, he was fined £100 for selling milk containing 35 grains of boracic acid per gallon of milk, although all milks are examined for preservatives, this dairyman's milk was the only milk in which we have found boracic acid since its addition to milk has been made illegal. The amount found in June was exactly the same as on the first occasion in 1919, although the wholesale firm that supplied him was different. The Local Food Committee and the Public Health Committee were unanimous in recommending the Ministry of Food (the only authority that could do so) to remove his name from the list of registered purveyors of milk, but no action was taken beyond acknowledging the receipt of the resolutions. The condition of the milk supply cannot therefore be regarded as satisfactory from the adulteration point of view, but with regard to its purity, the conditions are very much worse. On the suggestion of the Ministry of Health and with the approval of the Committee I arranged for the bacteriological examination of milk for tubercle bacilli. Milk was taken from 14 cowsheds in the borough, 11 milkshops, and 5 general or provision shops. Milk is actually sold in most of the cowsheds in our district, a custom to be deplored, although it is difficult to be done away with, as on certain Jewish festivals milk has to be drawn directly from the cow into the customer's jug. In one sample only—taken from a general shop—were tubercle bacilli found. Dr. Panton reported,— " The samples were labelled 1—30, and were all examined by film preparation for tubercle bacilli, and by guinea pig inoculation. "The guinea pigs inoculated with the first six samples were injected intraperitoncally with the centrifuged deposit of the milk. No tuberculosis was produced, but owing to the extremely toxic character of the milk it was necessary to inject the remaining guinea pigs intramuscularly, and it was further deemed advisable to make some examination of the bacteriological contents of the milk for other than tubercle bacilli. 22 "Of the remaining 24 samples, in only one instance has the milk definitely proved to be tuberculous. In this case, sample No. 27, the guinea pig killed after four weeks showed local tuberculous abscesses, tuberculosis of the lymph glands and commencing tuberculosis of the spleen. "In none of the samples were tubercle bacilli found in direct smear preparations. Of the 30 samples examined, therefore, tubercle bacilli were proved by guinea pig inoculation only in one case. "The bacteriological examination of the milk, although not specially asked for, was made partly as the result of the intraperitoneal inoculation of the first six samples and partly following upon the observation of the film made from the deposits and primarily stained for tubercle bacilli. "These films were in nearly every instance swarming with cocci and bacilli of various kinds. "Of the six guinea pigs inocuolated with samples Nos. 1—6 :— Sample No. 1.—Negative. „ No. 2.—Guinea pig died of general peritonitis in 48 hours. „ No. 3.—Guinea pig killed three weeks later showed the remains of general peritonitis, and purulent residual intraperitoneal abscesses. „ No. 4.—Guinea pig killed three weeks later showed the adhesions of old peritonitis. „ No. 5.—Guinea pig died of general peritonitis within 48 hours. „ No. 6.—Guinea pig killed after three weeks showed the adhesions of old peritonitis and residual intraperitoneal abscesses. "Of the guinea pigs thus inoculated, only one therefore escaped. Five got general peritonitis, of which two died within 48 hours and three made a partial recovery. "Of the 24 guinea pigs inoculated intramuscularly in the leg, three developed septic abscesses, and of these one had to be killed owing to the size of the abscess, and one other pig, as stated above, got local tuberculosis. "In the following samples, the actual bacteriological contents was estimated and the approximate nature of the bacteria present was worked out. Samples 19—-24 were examined by the method of decimal dilutions for their bacterial contents. The figures given are, however, possibly exaggerated since the cultures were not put up immediately, but after the milk had been kept for 24 hours on ice. It is also fair to add that at the time at which all these samples were examined, there was a period of warm weather, when bacteriological multiplication would be rapid. 23 Sample No. 19.—Typical bacillus coli communis more than 1,000 million per c.c. „ No. 20.—Coliform bacilli more than 1,000 million per c.c. (acidi lactici type). „ No. 21.—Typical bacillus coli communis more than 1,000 million per c.c. „ No. 22.—No coliform bacilli. Streptococci 1,000 million per c.c. „ No. 23.—Typical bacillus coli communis 100 milion per c.c. and Streptococci 1,000 million per c.c. „ No. 24.—Coliform bacilli 100 million per c.c. (acidi lactici type). Streptococci 1,000 million per c.c. "Samples 25 and 26 taken from cowsheds and sample No. 27 taken from a shop were bacteriologically examined, the cultures being made at mid-day immediately on receipt of the specimens from the Inspectors, and the following results were obtained:— Sample No. 25.—(Cow Shed). Coliform bacilli (not B.C.C.), 1,000 per c.c. Streptococci, 10 million per c.c. „ No. 26.—(Cow Shed). Coliform bacilli (not B.C.C.), 1,000 per c.c. Streptococci, 1 million per c.c. Other bacteria, 1,000 millions per c.c. „ No. 27.—(Shop). B. coli, 1 million per c.c. Streptococci, 10 millions per c.c. "The number of bacteria found in these samples of milk appears to me to be very greatly in excess of the bacteria which should be allowed to be present in a healthy milk supply. It is very grossly in excess of that allowed in other countries. In the Public Health Report for the City of Toronto, the bacteriological content of the milk was investigated, and the number of bacteria allowed in the milk was placed at a figure very inferior to the number present in these samples. The improvement in the bacteriological content of the milk of this city was associated wit 4 a very definite improvement in the figures of the infant mortality. The bacterial content of the few samples examined here may be compared with the figures of the Fourth Report of the Royal Sewage Commission of 1904. In samples taken from the sludge at Barrow Deep, the number of bacteria varied from one million to 10,000 million per c.c., so that the bacteriological content of some of these milk samples can be quite justly compared with the bacteriological content of the Thames sewage. "The actual bacteria present in these samples comprise not only the lactic acid bacilli, but coliform bacilli and streptococci in very large numbers. The pathogenicity of some of these bacteria is shown by the pathological conditions, other than tuberculosis, set up in the guinea pigs." 24 What is the remedy for this state of affairs? A drastic change in the methods of milk production and of distribution to the consumer is necessary. We have in Stepney 26 cowsheds licensed for 723 cows, some large, others are small premises. One is licensed for 148 cows. Three contain oyer 50 cows each. Their construction are not up to date, but this is not entirely the fault of the cowkeeper, as the London County Council—the Licensing Authority—have in the past objected to any structural alterations to the cowshed premises. The premises are kept fairly clean, and are limewashed once a year, but the back to back position of the cows does not encourage that cleanly condition under which it is possible to produce clean milk. There are no regulations which compel the milker to wash his hands previous to milking, and no clean overall is ever thought of. The cows are often in a filthy condition, and are seldom groomed. It is not at all surprising that the milk examined disclosed the presence of B. coli communis, showing that it had been exposed to faecal contamination. The cowsheds in Stepney are not worse than those in country districts. No cows are kept in 3 of the cowsheds and in the remaining 23 the following procedure is adopted:— 1. Milkers.—The milkers wash their hands before starting to milk the cows in every instance, and in 1 cowshed the milkers wash their hands two or three times during the process of milking. In another cowshed the milker washes his hands before he starts milking the succeeding cow, and in another cowshed, after every second cow. 2. Grooming of cows.—The cows are groomed once a day in 17 cowsheds, every other day in 3 cowsheds, twice a week in 2 and once a week in another. 3. Overalls.—In only 2 cowsheds are overalls worn by tlu milkers. In one the overalls are changed twice a week, and in the other when necessary. 4. Cleansing of coivsheds.—The cowsheds are cleaned out twice daily in 4 sheds, three times daily in 12 and four times daily in 7. 5. Washing of the udders before milking—No attempt is made to wash or clean the udders in 1 cowshed ; they are stated to be cleaned before milking if they are found to be dirty, in 3 cowsheds ; they are brushed in 1 cowshed, wiped or cleaned before starting milking in 12 and washed in the remaining 6 cowsheds. C. Milking pails.-—The receptacles into which the milk is drawn is, in every instance, the open milk pail, and in no cowshed is the modern, or improved pail, used, which is so constructed, that there is less risk of dirt, manure and straw getting admission into the milk. The Maternity and Infant Welfare Committee, acting on the suggestion of the Ministry of Health, instructed me to enquire whether it was not possible to procure a supply of Grade A milk. I wrote to the National Clean Milk Society, 25 who supplied me with the names of six firms who might supply the Council with certified clean milk. I wrote to these firms, but not one was in a position to do so at that time. The official "clean" milk is of two kinds. (1) Grade A Milk. Grade A milk is milk produced under specially clean and hygienic conditions, from a herd free from tuberculosis. The licence requires that the herd from which the milk is obtained must contain no cow or any bovine animal kept in contact with the herd, which has not passed the specified tuberculin test, and certain other prescribed requirements. While the licence is in force every facility must be afforded for taking samples of the milk of any cow in the herd, or of the mixed milk of the herd, or of any milk sold under the licence, at any time or place that may be thought necessary during the progress of the milk from the producer to the consumer. The farm must be open to inspection by a representative of the Ministry of Health, or a local authority acting on behalf of the Ministry, and must attain a certain standard in respect of equipment and methods. The licence in the first place is granted after such an inspection, and if at a later inspection the standard is found to have deteriorated the licence may be withdrawn. The milk must be cooled on the farm and consigned in a sealed container, having a label giving the address of the farm, the day of production, and whether from the morning or evening milking. Dealers, other than producers, who desire to obtain a licence to sell milk under the designation Grade A milk, must show that their equipment and methods are found satisfactory on inspection, that the milk is delivered to the consumer in the vessel in which it is received, or in bottles sterilised by steam, filled on the premises of the retailer, and closed by discs or caps, showing the day of production. (2) Grade A (Certified) Milk. In the production of Grade A (Certified) Milk certain additional precautions are enforced. The milk, after cooling, is bottled on the producers' premises in sterilised bottles, and labelled to show the day of production, and the time of day. The milk on examination at any time before delivery to the consumer must not contain B. coli communis in one-tenth of a cubic centimetre (in each of two tubes), or more than 30,000 bacteria per cubic centimetre. Further, the milk must not be delivered to the consumer as Grade A (Certified) milk, more than two days after the day of production, but milk, fulfilling these conditions, will keep sweet much longer. This Grade A (Certified) milk must be delivered to the purchaser in the bottles in which it has been received from the producer with caps intact. Hygienic methods of milk production must of necessity raise the price of milk owing to the extra precautions taken, and the work involved in supplying a guaranteed pure and clean article, but the .Committee were prepared to accept this, and to supply the poorest infants in the district with a clean and pure supply of milk, and give them a chance for the first time to compete for their existence with children of people who are in better circumstances. 26 Unsound Food Destroyed.

Verminous Persons. 351 persons were cleansed during the year, and their clothing disinfected. Of these 345 were adults—319 males and 26 females—and 6 were children. Canal Boats Acts, 1877 and 1884. Pursuant to the Third Section of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, being the Registration Authority under the above Acts, has to report as follows with regard to the execution of such Acts and of the Regulations made thereunder, and as to the steps taken by them as such authority during the year 1920 to give effect to the provisions of the said Acts and Regulations, viz.:— (1) Canal boats coming within the district are inspected by a sanitary inspector, who receives a sum of £10 per annum for the performance of this duty. His inspection is irrespective of the examination of boats made by the examining officer prior to their registration. (2) The number of boats inspected in 1920 was 46, and the condition of the boats and their occupants, as regards the matters dealt with in the Acts and Regulations was very good. (3) Infringements of Acts and Regulations were discovered as follows :— (a) Registration 1 (b) Notification of change of master Nil (c) Certificates 1 (d) Marking 1 (e) Overcrowding Nil.

I made an official representation under Part I of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, with respect to two areas in the Borough. The representation was made to the London County Council, the authority responsible for the administration of Part I, the area being too large to be dealt with under Part II. (1) Bell Lane Area.—The official representation was made on December 2nd, 1919, that the houses in the area are unfit for human habitation and dangerous to the health of the inhabitants of the buildings therein. Further, that in my opinion the most satisfactory method of dealing with the evils connected with such houses and the sanitary defects in such area is an improvement scheme for the re-arrangement and reconstruction of the streets and houses within such area. The area is situated in Spitalfields to the west of Commercial Street and to the east of Bell Lane and is bounded on the north by Butler Street and on the south by Wentworth Street, but includes six houses to the south side of Wentworth Street. It includes Bell Lane (east side), Bell Court, Tenter Street, Butler Street (south side), Freeman Street, Palmer Street, Tilley Street, Shepherd Street and Buildings, Emery Place, Eastman's Court, Katherine Terrace, Wentworth Street (31 to 73 and 52 to 62), Wentworth Courts, and Ann's Place. The area covers about 4 acres, and consists of 293 houses with a population about 1,351 people. 23 houses were unoccupied, 33 were used for business premises only and the remaining 235 were occupied by members of the working classes. The houses are not all equally bad—some are much worse than others. According to a map dated 1799, there were houses in Wentworth Street and Bell Lane, and in Courts at the back of both of these streets but in the interior of the area there was an open ground known as Tenter Ground. According to an old report of the Medical Officer of Health for the Whitechapel District the Tenter Ground was paved about 1850. In 1858 much satisfaction is expressed by the Medical Officer of Health in his Annual Report for 1857 for a new sewer which was constructed in Shepherd Street, where nearly all the houses had cesspools previously, which have been abolished since its construction, so that at that date every house was properly drained. In 1860 sewers were constructed and all the houses in Butler Street, Palmer Street, Tilley Street, Tenter Street and Freeman Street were in that year drained into the new sewers. It is therefore fairly conclusive that most of the houses in Bell Lane, Wentworth Court, Wentworth Street, were built previous to 1800 and that the remainder were constructed some time between 1800 and 1850. 47 The official representation was considered by the London County Council and agreed to, the Ministry of Health held a local enquiry at St. George's Town Hall, on October 29th. The Inquiry lasted three days but the result is not yet known. No communication has since been received from the Ministry of Health on the matter. (2) Back Church Lane Area.—The official representation was made on August 6th, 1919. This area is situated in St. George-in-the-East to the south of Commercial Road. It is bounded on the west by Back Church Lane, on the east by Berner Street, on the north by Boyd Street, and on the South by Ellen Street. It includes all the houses in Everard Street, 70 to 82 in Berner Street, 2 to 52, Boyd Street, the houses on the north side of Ellen Street (Nos. 1 to 51). The area consists of 112 houses with a population of 533. The number of persons suffering from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Erysipelas, Small Pox and Spotted Fever was, in proportion, twice that for the whole of the Borough of Stepney in 1916 and 1917, and eight times as much in 1918. In 1799 this area had a few houses adjoining Back Church Lane. The remaining houses were built in the early part of the 19th century. The narrowness, closeness and bad arrangement of the streets and houses and the bad condition of the houses with the sanitary defects connected therewith are dangerous to health, and the most satisfactory method of dealing with the evils connected with such houses is an improvement scheme for the re-arrangement and reconstruction of the houses and streets therein. The local Inquiry by the Minister of Health was held in October but the result of that inquiry has not yet been communicated to the Council. Overcrowding. The tendency to overcrowding has increased since the war due to the short supply of houses. Houses which were intended for, and occupied by single families, have become occupied by two or more families per house. Having regard to the dearth of houses no action has been taken where the overcrowding has only been slight, such as one child in excess of the proper number. 11,632 inspections were made for the purpose of detecting overcrowding, but 62 only were found to be overcrowded. No Police Court proceedings were taken for the abatement of overcrowding. 48 Water Supply. Water supply cut off. In accordance with the requirements of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Metropolitan Water Board reported that the water had been cut off in 135 premises. The reason for discontinuing the water supply was the non-payment of the rate. Cisterns. In most of the houses water for drinking purposes is drawn from the main, but there are many houses in which the supplies are obtained from cisterns. Their situation and accessibility are often far from being satisfactory, and the majority of them are not cleansed as often as they should be. Notices were served during the year in regard to defects and the necessity for cleansing 60 cisterns. Houses Let In Lodgings. Included under this heading are houses occupied by members of more than one family, which have been registered by a resolution of the Council, irrespective of the rents at which the houses are let. No addition to the list of registered houses has been made during the year. The number at the end of 1920 was 2,512. All the houses were kept under supervision, irregular and systematic inspections were made to them. Number of visits made—5,857. Number of notices served relative to cleansing—2,587. Other notices—873. General Sanitary Work. 65,738 re-visits were made by the Inspectors to supervise the abatement of the nuisances found in 25,513 houses. 2,502 drains were tested with smoke or water, and 94 were re-tested; 2,572 drains were either constructed or reconstructed, cleansed or repaired; 246 were trapped. 128 new soil pipes were fixed and ventilated; 719 new closet-pans and traps were fixed ; 6,390 closets were either cleansed or repaired, or provided with additional light and ventilation ; 1,895 water-closets were provided with proper flushing apparatus. 3,706 yards, forecourts and areas were paved or repaired.

The vast majority of the houses in the Borough are old, and many are worn out. The gardens or open spaces at the rear have been partly or wholly built over in hundreds of houses. Factories or workshops have been erected in many, and sculleries or back addition rooms in others. The general character of the defects found in the houses inspected was due to dilapidations following inattention or neglect during the war years. 50,201 houses were inspected, 14,812 being the result of house-to-house inspections. 25,513 intimation notices were served for the abatement of the various nuisances and it was necessary for these to be followed by 15,007 statutory notices. The owners carried out the necessary work in 10,406 houses without waiting for the statutory notices. The readiness on the part of the owners to remedy any nuisance immediately it is brought to their notice, is not so marked as it was before the war, due probably to the increased cost of labour and building materials and their scarcity. All the statutory notices were not complied with until police court proceedings were taken, which became necessary in 140 cases. Having regard to the difficulties, the Council decided to take advantage of Section 28 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1919, and to undertake themselves the repair of houses which were not reasonably fit for human habitation, where the owners failed to comply with the requirements of notices served upon them. At their meeting on January 27th the Public Health Committee decided to recommend the Council to appoint five temporary Sanitary Inspectors to inspect, report, and carry out their work generally under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1919, and thus to assist the district Inspectors working under the Public Health Act, 1891, and by-laws, includiug those of houses-let-in-lodgings, in making a house to house inspection of the Borough as rapidly as possible. These five Inspectors were appointed and commenced their duties in August, 1920. A house to house inspection was organised throughout the Borough. It was operated simultaneously in 20 districts and great progress was made. The five temporary inspectors made a house to house inspection in their respective areas and served an intimation notice in the ordinary way. If the defects were not remedied, a second inspection took place and a specification was drawn up of the whole work required and submitted to the Council for their approval and for authority to serve a notice under Section 28. Mr. Forbes commenced in the area bounded on the east by the canal and Canal Road, on the west by White Horse Lane, on the north by Mile End Road and on the south by Ben Jonson Road. A good many of the streets were inspected by the district inspector and the remainder by Mr. Forbes. 57 When this area was completed, Mr. Forbes was transferred to supplement the the inspection by the district inspector in the area west of White Horse Lane, so that the area south of Mile End Road and east of Jubilee Street could be completed. Mr. Harris inspected the area commencing at Gardiners Corner and working eastwards, acting in conjunction with the district inspector who worked under the Public Health Act, until the inspection of the area to the west of New Road is completed. When this has been done he will resume to the east of New Road working in conjunction with the District inspector and thus to finish the area to the west of Jubilee Street. This will then complete the Whitechapel East Ward, Mile End Centre, South and West wards of that part of Mile End which is to the east of the canal and to the south of Mile End Road. Mr. Bottomley commenced in the area known as Limehouse Fields (Ratcliff) to the south of Ben Jonson Road working in conjunction with the district inspector so as to complete this area. Having finished this he proceeded to the Limehouse North Ward and then he will go on to the Limehouse South Ward. Mr. Toll started in the Mile End South East ward to the east of the canal working in conjunction with the district inspector inspecting under the Public Health Act. Mr. Galvin started in the Whitechapel Middle ward and Spitalfields working in conjunction with the district inspector inspecting under the Public Health Act. When he has completed this district, he will proceed to Mile End New Town. When he has completed the district south of Mile End Road, Mr. Harris will start on Mile End North Ward in conjunction with the district inspectors for that part of the Borough. With regard to St. Georges the district Inspectors inspected the greater part of the district and will continue until they inspect all the houses in the district, which will probably be completed in 1921. None of the five temporary inspectors worked in St. Georges. Notices were served on the owners under Section 28 of the Housing & Town Planning, &c. Act, 1919, requiring them within a reasonable time to execute such works as may be necessary to make the houses in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. If the notices were not complied with, the Borough Engineer, after reasonable notice to the owners, was instructed to enter upon the premises and to carry out the work specified. The number of inspections made under Section 28 of the Housing & Town Planning Act, 1919 was 2,995, which necessitated the serving of 2,772 intimation notices followed by 707 statutory notices authorised by the Council and served by the Town Clerk. The owners did not comply with the notices and the Borough Engineer carried out the necessary work in 50 houses.

There is a considerable reduction in the number of cows kept in cowsheds in the Borough due to the large increase in the price of cows in recent years, and the increased cost of fodder and labour. The keeping of cows in a Borough such as that of Stepney may have its advantages but the system is an uneconomical one to say the least of it. Cows are kept in the cowsheds for about a year and are then slaughtered. Some of them are such excellent milkers that it is a pity to have them destroyed. The milk produced by cows in London cowsheds is fresher and probably cleaner than country milk. The cowsheds are cleaner, lighter, better ventilated, and are subject to inspection by our Sanitary Inspectors as well as by the Inspectors of the London County Council. List of Cowsheds.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my first annual report, dealing with the work carried out in the Borough Laboratories during the year 1920. As I commenced my duties here on May 1st, my report covers four months, during which the Office of Public Analyst was held by my predecessor. During the year 1,190 samples of food and drugs were examined. 1,144 were formal samples submitted by Inspectors for analysis under the Sale of Foods and Drugs Acts, 23 were informal samples submitted by the Inspectors, and 23 samples were analysed for the Public Health Department. There were no samples from other Departments. Table A shows the nature of the samples examined with the number and percentage of samples adulterated. Table A. Nature. Number of Samples.

It is to be hoped that the increase will further reduce food adulteration in the borough. With foodstuffs at their present high prices, food adulteration is extremely profitable, and heavy penalties are necessary to convince fraudulent vendors that " honesty is the best policy." A simple instance will illustrate this. A small milk dealer, selling a churn of milk each morning, and another in the afternoon can, by adding 10 per cent. of water to his milk, make a fraudulent profit of about £4 a week in addition to his legitimate profit. No doubt many of the dealers prosecuted during the year sell more than two churns of milk a day, and there have been numerous cases in which the adulteration has exceeded 10 per cent. MILK. 858 samples of milk were analysed, of which 49, or 5.7 per cent., were adulterated. Table E shows the number of samples of milk examined, and the percentage of adulterated samples for the past six years. 93 Table E. 1915. 1916. 1917. 1918. 1919. 1920. Number of Samples 868 850 739 737 665 858 Percentage of Adulteration 15.0 11.6 12.4 16.0 8.6 5.7 Last year shows a large improvement in the milk supply of the borough. Roughly, one sample in seventeen was adulterated, compared with one in six in 1918, and one in twelve in 1919. In spite of the improvement the above figures show that there is still a great deal of tampering with milk in the borough. A simple calculation will make this more evident:—Assuming that each person in Stepney uses a quarter of a pint of milk per day, and that 5.7 per cent. of this milk is adulterated, with 10 per cent. of either water or separated milk, then about 18,000 gallons of either water or separated milk are sold annually as new milk. A similar calculation indicates that about 800 gallons of water or separated milk was supplied as milk under the Council's Milk Distribution Scheme last year. The average composition of all the samples of milk analysed for each month of the year is given in Table F. Table F. Period. Average Composition of all (858) Samples. Total Solids. per cent. Solids not Fat. per cent. Fat. per cent.

The table entirely refutes the statement, frequently made in court and elsewhere, that farmers have difficulty in producing milk to satisfy the minimum limits prescribed by the Sale of Milk Regulations. Milk of the minimum standard of quality is far below the general average of that yielded by any herd of cows in fair condition. Indeed, it is only extremely rarely that a herd of cows, properly fed and under healthy conditions, have yielded a milk of so low a quality as would correspond to the minimum standard. Milk is the chief, and at times, the only food of infants and invalids, and on this ground alone, it is important that its quality should be kept up, and that every effort should be made to prevent its being rcduced to a comparatively low minimum.

They do not separate on standing, and cannot be removed by mechanical means. Accordingly a deficiency of Solids-not-Fat points to the addition of water. Watering, of course, lowers the percentage of fat equally with that of the Solids-not-Fat, but when the deficiency of fat exceeds that of the Solids-not-Fat, or is the only deficiency, then some of the fat has been removed by skimming or,—what comes to the same thing,—the proportion of fat has been lowered by the addition of skimmed or separated milk. The deficiencies are calculated from the legal minimum figures. As these are much below the average figures for the milk sold in the Borough (see Table F), it can safely be assumed that the percentages of adulteration shown in the table considerably under estimate the extent of adulteration in the great majority of cases. Last year four cases were dismissed as the vendor held a warranty from the wholesale dealer. 96 BUTTER. Eighty-nine samples were analysed of which two or 2.2 per cent. were returned as adulterated. J 48. Contained 3.7 per cent. excess of water. Informal sample. E 69. Consisted of margarine. Fined £10. Boric acid is practically the only preservative systematically used in the case of butter. Rather over half the samples submitted to me contained this preservative. 46.3 per cent. of the samples were free from preservative. 26.2 „ „ „ contained 0.1 per cent, boric acid. 17.5 ,, ,, ,, 0.2 „ „ 5 ,, ,, ,, ,, 0.3 ,, ,, 5 ,, ,, ,, 0.4 ,, ,, The Departmental Committee on Preservatives in Food recommend that the only preservative allowed to be used for butter and margarine should be boric acid or borax, in amount not exceeding 0.5 per cent. calculated as boric acid. As this limit is generally accepted I had to report all the above samples as genuine. The above figures show that butter can be sold free from preservative and I consider that preserved butter should be required to have a declaratory label similar to that required in the case of preserved cream. MARGARINE. Seventy-three samples were analysed, all of which were genuine. Most of the samples contained boric acid as a preservative. Of the samples submitted to me :— 10.9 per cent. of the samples were free from preservative. 8.7 contained 0.2 per cent. boric acid. 43.5 0.2 32.5 0.3 4.4 0.4 20 vendors of margarine had not complied with the requirements of the Butter and Margarine Acts, with regard to labelling. The main legal requirements in connection with the sale of margarine are :— (1) That each parcel of margarine exposed for sale shall be clearly marked " Margarine " in printed capital letters of not less than one and a half inches. 97 (2) That it shall be sold in a wrapper in which the word " Margarin" shall be printed in half inch letters. (3) That it shall not contain more than 10 per cent. of butter fat. The action taken in the 20 cases in which these requirements had not been complied with is shown in Table H. Table H. Number.

In each case the adulteration consisted of a deficiency of acetic acid. All the samples consisted of " artificial " vinegar, i.e., they consisted of a dilute solution of acetic acid, coloured with caramel with, in a few cases, a little malt vinegar added. Unfortunately it is difficult to obtain convictions for this substitution unless " malt " vinegar is asked for. Table J. Number. Adulteration. Result.
