MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1909. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney. GENTLEMEN,—I beg to present herewith my Eighteenth Annual Report on the Public Health of the Borough of Hackney. The favourable condition of Hackney during the year 1908, viewed from a health standpoint, has not only been maintained but has also further improved during the year 1909. This latter year was characterised by the low general death rate of 13.7 per 1,000 persons living. This is lower even than that of the previous year, which was the lowest rate recorded for many years. The infant mortality rate was 108 per 1,000 births. This is 9 per 1,000 births lower than that of 1908. On this point it must be admitted that the cool and wet summer of 1909 was very favourable to a low infantile death-rate. Infectious disease was also very low during last year, the zymotic death-rate being .93 per 1,000 of the population. These figures are very encouraging when the increasing density of the Borough and the fact, which I mentioned in my last year's report of its growing industrial character, are considered. That Hackney is becoming largely industrial may be appreciated from the fact that at the end of 1909 there were 438 factories, 1,311 workshops, and 3,263 outworkers in the Borough. In face of these facts it must be a matter for congratulation that, in spite of increasing density and the gradual change to industrial conditions, the annual mortality from all causes, and the infant mortality have progressively declined This may be seen from the following table: — Table showing Density of Population, Annual Mortality from all causes and Infant Mortality in the Borough of Hackney, during the 11 years ending 1909. Year. Density. General Death Rate (per 1,000 living). Infantile Mortality Rate (per 1,000 births). 1899 67.5 17.9 165 1900 66.5 17.4 162 1901 66.7 16.0 137 1902 67.3 16.0 121 1903 67.9 14.7 127 1904 68.5 16.0 155 1905 69.1 15.0 140 1906 69.8 14.1 123 1907 70.6 14.4 116 1908 71.0 13.9 117 1909 71.3 13.7 108 In reference to the subject of infant mortality, I have, in the absence of a health visitor appointed by the Council, made free use of voluntary health visitors during the year, for the purpose of giving advice to parents needing it in the care and feeding of infants. The number of such visits made during the year in the poorer districts of the Borough was 577, of which 357 were primary visits and 220 subsequent visits. I have elsewhere 7 pressed the opinion that more requires to be done than making use of voluntary workers, if the problem of reducing the infant mortality is to be successfully solved. Not only must a permanent, well qualified health visitor be appointed to supervise and co-ordinate the work of these voluntary workers, but means must be obtained (from voluntary sources) to assist the needy mother and child during the early months of the infant's life. Another urgent problem calling for earnest and energetic action on the part of the local authority is how to diminish the prevalence of that scourge of our race, pulmonary tuberculosis. The knowledge of this disease is so complete that we are in a position with every hope, to bring about a considerable reduction in its prevalence at a relatively small cost if the matter is faced earnestly and resolutely. The Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, which came into force in Hackney at the beginning of 1909, are of great help in dealing with the cases of tuberculosis coming under the notice of the Poor Law officials. In another part of this report I give details of enquiries made respecting the cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified to me during 1909. I have no hesitation in saying that a retrospective glance at the sanitary progress of Hackney is very gratifying, and that the outlook for future progress, especially in staying the progress of infant mortality and pulmonary tuberculosis, most encouraging. I am pleased to state that the officers of the Public Health Department have, on the whole, carried out the duties entrusted to them to my entire satisfaction. Population and Density,—Approaching as we are the end of an intercensal period, it must be remembered that estimates of population, based now on the rate of increase during the last intercensal period, are apt to be wide of the actual numbers, so that the estimate of population for the year 1909 may only be approximate With this reservation, and applying the same rate of increase of 8 population which took place Hackney, during the ten years 1891 to 1901, I estimate the population of the Borough of Hackney at the end of June, 1909, to be 235,525 persons. This estimate gives a density of 71.3 persons per acre for the whole Borough, varying from 51.0 persons per acre in the North Sub-District to 81.3 persons per acre in the South-East Sub-District. The following table gives the population and density of the Sub-Districts, compared with the whole of London:— Table.

The annual marriage rate for persons married during this period is 17.2 per 1,000 of the population, that for all London for the same period being 15.8 per 1,000 of the population. The following table gives the number of marriages and marriage rates for the Borough of Hackney and London for the ten years 1899-1908 :— 9 ]Year. Borough of Hackney. London. Marriages. Marriage Rate. Marriage Rate 1899 1,754 15.7 18.6 1900 1,684 15.3 18.0 1901 1,756 15.9 17.6 1902 1,668 15.0 17.8 1903 1,695 15.1 17.4 1904 1,710 15.1 17.0 1905 1,714 15.0 16.9 1906 1,770 15.4 17.1 1907 1,906 16.4 17.0 1908 1,996 17.0 15.9 Average 1899—1908 1,765 15.5 17.3 1909 2,036 17.2 15.8 Births.—During the year 1909, the total number of births registered in the Borough was 5,702, of which 2,874 were males and 2,828 were females. These figures show an increase of 29 in the number of births, compared with that registered during the year 1908. The annual birth-rate for Hackney for the year 1909 is therefore 24.2 per 1,000 of the population. The following table gives the number of births registered in the different sub-districts with their respective birth rates compared with those of London. It will be seen from this table that the birth rate for Hackney has declined from 29.0 per 1,000 of the population in year 1899 to 24.2 per 1,000 of the population in 1909. This means, that if the birth rate of 1899 had been maintained over last year, there would have been 1,128 more births in Hackney than actually occurred, but this decline need not give rise to anxiety ; for pari passu with the 10 declining birth rate there has been a declining death rate. This latter has declined from 17.9 per 1,000 living persons in 1899 to 13.2 per 1,000 living persons in 1909. This means that if the death rate of 1899 had been maintained over last year there would have been 1,104 more deaths in Hackney than actually occurred. The decline in deaths almst exactly counterbalances the loss of population due to the declining birth rate. The birth rate for all London for the year 1909 is 24.2 per 1,000 living. Illegitimate Births and Birth Rates.—The total number of illegitimate births registered in the Borough of Hackney during 1909 was 385, but of these, 282 occurred in the Salvation Army Rescue Home, Mare Street, 260 being of mothers from places outside of Hackney, also 6 illegitimate births occurred in the Hackney Union Infirmary—the mothers belonging to other districts. Deducting these 266 from the total registered, there remain 119 illegitimate births amongst the population of Hackney during 1909. This is equivalent to an illegitimate birth rate of 20'8 per 1,000 births. Below is given birth rates for the respective sub-districts of the Borough for the year 1909 :— Table. Births. Registration District of Hackney. Registration Sub-District. All London. North. Central. SouthWest. South- East.

But on the other hand, there were 447 Hackney residents who died during the same period in the Institutions outside the Borough. Making the necessary corrections by subtracting 442 from and adding 447 to the total 3,123 we obtain the correct number, viz. 3,128 amongst Hackney residents during the year 1909. This total shows a decline of three deaths upon the number registered during 1908. The general rate from all causes for the year 1909 is therefore 132 per 1,000 of the estimated population. On making further correction for age and sex distribution by means 12 of the factor 1.04262, I obtain for the Borough the corrected general death rate of 13 7 per 1,000 of the population. The corrected general mortality rate for 1908 was 13'9, so the rate for last year shows a slight improvement upon the rate for the preceding year. Amongst the sub-districts, I find the lowest death rate in the North (11.2 per 1,000) and the highest (15.0 per 1,000) in the South-west sub-district. Sub-District. Population. No. of Births.

The following shows the death rate of Hackney from all causes per 1,000, compared with London, during the last decade:— Year. Hackney. London. Year. Hackney. London. 1898 17.1 18.4 1904 16.0 16.6 1899 17.9 19.6 1905 15.0 15.1 1900 17.4 18.6 1906 14.1 15.1 1901 16.6 17.1 1907 14.1 15.35 1902 16.0 17.2 1908 13.9 14.5 1903 14.7 15.7 1909 13.2 14.0 Infant Mortality.—The deaths of infants under one year of age registered in the Borough during 1909 numbered 616. This is a decline of 50 on the number registered during the year 1908. The infant mortality rate therefore for the last year is 108 per 1,000 births, that for the year 1908, being 117 per 1,000 births. 13 Diarrhœat diseases causes 83 deaths ; wasting diseases including premature births were responsible for 212 deaths; tuberculous diseases, 36 deaths ; overlying, 16 deaths ; lung diseases, 95 deaths ; and the common infectious diseases, 32 deaths. Many of those it may be observed are preventable. In connection with infant mortality it will not be out of place to refer to measures of a general nature which have been adopted which may exercise in the future a profound influence for good on the infant death rate of the Borough. I refer first of all to the order of the Local Government Board, issued on the 18th October, 1909, declaring the notification of Births Act, 1907, to be in force in the Borough. The object of this Act it will be remembered is to enable local authorities to obtain early notification of births, so that steps may be taken at an early date after birth to bring to mothers and others having the care of infants advice as to the "proper nurture, care and management of young children and the promotion of cleanliness, etc." Supplementary to this Act and prior to its being declared in force in Hackney, the Local Government Board issued "The Health Visitors (London) Order, 1909." This order has for its object the making of Regulations respecting the qualification, duties, salaries, and tenure of office of health visitors appointed under Section 6 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. This latter Act gives local authorities in London power to appoint suitable women (to be known as health visitors) for the purpose of giving to persons advice as to the proper nurture, care and management of young children, and the promotion of cleanliness and discharging such other duties (if any), as may be assigned to them in accordance with the provisions of the above Section. Thus the notification of Births Act, 1907, and the Supplementary Health Visitors' Order, 1909, put in the hands of the Metropolitan Borough Councils powerful means by which they may in the future do much to lessen infant mortality by a comparatively small expenditure. 14 Table V.—INFANTILE MORTALITY.

The annual mortality rate of persons of 65 years and upwards is 3.7 per 1,000 persons living. Deaths in Public Institutions.—There were 1,282 deaths in public institutions in the Borough during 1909; of these 442 were residents of other districts, and the remaining 840 were residents of Hackney. The following lists give the institutions within the Borough, receiving persons both from and without the Borough, and also the institutions outside the Borough receiving sick and infirm persons from the Borough, with the number of deaths in each institution during the year 1909. 17 INSTITUTIONS OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT RECEIVING SICK AND INFIRM PERSONS FROM THE DISTRICT.

During the year 1909, there were 1,403 cases of infectious diseases compulsorily notified in the Borough; but of these, 83 were subsequently ascertained not to be suffering from the disease notified, thus reducing the total number of cases of genuine notifiable infectious disease to 1,320. This shows a decline of 660 cases on the number notified during the year 1908. The attack-rate for the year 1909 in respect of the compulsorily notifiable infectious diseases is, therefore, 56 per 1,000 persons living. In addition, there were 354 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations and 58 voluntary cases of phthisis. The deaths from the seven chief zymotic diseases numbered during the year 220. This is equal to a zymotic death rate of .93 per 1,000 persons living in the Borough. A—NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Smallpox.—One case of this disease was notified during 1909. The case was that of a man aged 54, engaged as a salesman in the City. The case was immediately removed to hospital, the other members of the family were urged to be re-vaccinated and the premises were disinfected. There was no further extension of the disease. The facts regarding the occupation of the patient were communicated to the Medical Officer of Health for the City. Scarlet Fever.—The total number of cases of this disease notified in the Borough during 1909 was 786, but of these, 36 were afterwards found not to be suffering from Scarlet Fever. The genuine cases of this disease notified was 750. This is a decline of 464 on the number of genuine cases notified during 1908. The attack rate of Scarlet Fever for 1909 is 3.1 per 1,000 persons living. The chart accompanying this report shows the incidence of this c 34 disease week by week during the year. It will be seen that with the exception of three moderate rises in the incidence of the disease in the months of January, February, and again in September (which last it will be observed coincides with the opening of the public elementary schools) Scarlet Fever was unusually low in the Borough during the whole year. The number of cases removed to hospital during the year was 691. This is equal to 92 per cent. of the cases notified. The following table shows the dates of removal of these cases in relation to the date of notification. SCARLET FEVER—1909. Nursed at Home. Removed to Hospital. Removal to Hospital after Notification. Before Receipt of Notification. Same Day as Notification Received. 1 Day. 2 Days. 3 Days. Over 7 Days. 95 504 174 7 2 2 2 Total Cases Removed, 691. The following table shows the distribution of Scarlet Fever in the respective sub-districts of the Borough:— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Scarlet Fever. 145 206 158 277 Attack Rate per 1,000 living. 2.6 3.6 2.5 4.4 From this table it will be seen that the incidence of the disease was lowest in the South-West sub-district (2.5 per 1,000) and highest in the South-East sub-district (4.4 per 1,000). The deaths from Scarlet Fever during 1909 numbered 13. This is equivalent to a mortality rate of 16.5 per 1,000 attacked, and .05 per 1,000 persons living. 35 The mortality for London for the same disease during the same period is .08 per 1,000 persons living. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—There were 267 cases of diphtheria and membranous croup notified during 1909, but of these 38 cases were subsequently found not to be suffering from this disease, so that the genuine cases of diphtheria and membranous croup occurring in the Borough during the above period was 229. This is a decrease of 122 cases upon the number of genuine cases notified during 1908, and is equivalent to an attack rate of 0.9 per 1,000 persons living. As will be seen from the chart the incidence of the disease was abnormally low during the whole year, the average per week being only 44. The number of cases removed to hospital was 227. This is equal to 85 per cent. of the cases notified. The following table shows the distribution of the cases of this disease in the different sub-districts of the Borough during 1909:- Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. 42 71 67 87 Total attack rate per 1,000. .76 1.2 1.1 1.3 It will be noted from the above that the disease was more prevalent in the Central and South-East sub-districts than in the North. The deaths from diphtheria and membranous croup during the year numbered 19. This is equivalent to a mortality rate of 8.3 per 1,000 attacked, and .08 per 1,000 persons living. c 2 36 The death rate from diphtheritic disease for all London for the same period is .13 per 1,000 living'persons. During the year, 153 swabbings from throats of persons suspected to be suffering from diphtheria were bacteriologically examined, 40 of which gave positive and 107 negative results, and six were doubtful. Typhoid or Enteric Fever.—The number of cases of this disease notified during the year was 59, but of these, 7 were found at a later date not to have been suffering from typhoid fever, thus reducing the genuine cases to 52. This is a decline of nine upon the number of genuine cases notified during 1908. The attack rate for 1909 is .22 per 1,000 persons living. The chart shows the disease to be present in the Borough during the whole year, but with no special incidence upon any particular season. Of the 59 cases notified, 49 were removed to hospital. This is equal to 83 per cent. of the total cases notified. The table below gives the distribution of the cases in the subdistricts of the Borough. Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Typhoid. 8 19 10 22 Attack Rate per 1,000 living. .14 .33 .16 .35 From this it may be seen that the incidence of the disease was greater in the Central and South-West sub-districts. The deaths from enteric or typhoid fever during the year numbered six. This is equal to an annual mortality of 11.5 per per 1,000 attacked and 0 025 per 1,000 persons living. 37 During the year, specimens of blood from 21 persons suspected to be suffering from enteric fever were submitted to what is known as "Widals" test; of these six gave a positive and the remainder a negative re-action. One carrier case was kept under observation during the year, the excretions being examined bacteriologically every month after leaving hospital for six months. The results of such examination were negative. The mortality for all London for the same period is .03 per 1,000 persons living. Typhus.—No case of typhus fever was notified during 1909. Continued Fever.—One^ case of continued fever was notified during the year. Puerperal Fever.—There were 15 cases of puerperal fever notified during 1909 of which seven were removed to hospital. The deaths from this disease numbered seven. The attack rate for the year was 3.0 per 1,000 births and the death rate 1.2 per 1,000 births. Plague.— No case of this disease occurred in the Borough during 1909. Erysipelas.—There were 268 cases of this disease notified in the Borough during 1909. This is equal to an attack rate of 1.1 per 1,000 persons living. Of the 268 cases notified, 91 were removed to hospital, which is equal to nearly 34 per cent. of the total. There were 14 deaths registered in the Borough as due to erysipelas. This is equal to a mortality rate of 5.2 per cent. attacked, and 0.5 per 1,000 persons living. 38 The following table shows the distribution of the disease in the sub-districts of the Borough :— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Erysipelas. 32 61 44 131 Rate per 1,000 living. .58 1.1 .71 2.1 Cerebro Spinal Fever.—There were six cases of this disease notified in Hackney during 1909, all of which terminated fatally. In two cases the specific micro-organism, the diplococcus intracellularis, was isolated. Glanders, Anthrax and Hydrophobia in Man.—The following notice relating to the notification of the above disease was issued to the Borough Councils of London in April, 1909. NOTIFICATION OF GLANDERS, ANTHRAX AND HYDROPHOBIA IN MAN. The London County Council hereby give notice that, at a meeting held on the 23rd day of March, 1909, it made an order as follows:— The London County Council doth hereby resolve and order that Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to the notification of infectious disease shall apply, in the Administrative County of London, to the diseases known as Glanders, Anthrax, and Hydrophobia in man. The Order, which has been approved by the Local Government Board, was duly advertised on 19th April, 1909, and will come into operation as from and including 26th April, 1909. 39 The effect of the Order is to require that, on becoming aware that the inmate of any house, building, vessel, tent, van, shed, or similar structure used for human habitation within the Administrative County of London, is suffering from Glanders, Anthrax or Hydrophobia the Head of the Family to which the patient belongs, and in his default, the nearest relatives of the patient present in the house, or in attendance on, the patient, and, in default of such relatives every person in charge of, or in attendance on, the patient, and, in default of any such person, the master of the house or other similar structure, shall send notice of the case to the Medical Officer of Health of the sanitary district in which the house or structure is situated; and every Medical Practitioner attending on or called in to visit the patient shall send to the same Medical Officer of Health a Certificate giving full particulars of the case. The Notice or certificate may be sent to the Medical Officer of Health at his office or residence. Every person required by the Statute to send a notice or certificate who fails forthwith to send the same will be liable to a Fine not exceeding Forty Shillings. G. L. GOMME, Clerk to the London County Council. County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 20th April, 1909. No case of these diseases was notified in the Borough of Hackney during 1909. B. -NON NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Influenza.—This disease was responsible for 58 deaths in Hackney during 1909. This is an increase of 4 upon the number registered during 1908. The annual mortality for this disease for the former year is .24 per 1,000 persons living and that for all London .23 per 1,000. 40 Chickenpox.—One death was ascribed to this disease during 1909. Diarrhœa.—This disease is most prevalent during the summer months and exercises a great influence upon the death-rate. It is more prevalent in proportion as the summer temperature rises, and is regarded as being chiefly dependent upon surface pollutions of organic matter, which obtains access to articles of food either by the agency of flies or by currents of air, or conveyance by uncleanly habits. The measures which should be adopted to lessen this disease are those which aim at the prevention or removal of surface pollution. Amongst the chief of these measures is the periodical removal of filth from the streets, especially the droppings of animals, etc., and the periodical removal of all refuse from dwelling houses and their neighbourhood. These measures are especially necessary in the poorer and more densely populated parts of the Borough—the parts with narrow streets and houses occupied by the poor—because summer diarrhoea is most prevalent in such places. The introduction of motor traction and the substitution of electric trams for horse traction in the Borough, in so far as these supplant horses as motor agents, will in the future act, and are now no doubt acting in the reduction of summer diarrhoea, by diminishing the surface pollution of the streets caused by horses. This disease was registered as the cause of 74 deaths in Hackney during 1909, and of these 52 were under the age of one year. The total shows a decline of 79 upon the number of deaths registered during 1908. In addition to the diarrhoea deaths there were 45 deaths from enteritis. The mortality rate from diarrhoea is .31 per 1,000 persons living. The mortality r ate for London for the same period is .33 per 1,000 persons living. The distribution of the deaths from diarrhœa may be seen on next page. 41 Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East.

This is a decline of 17 upon the number occurring during 1908. The mortality rate for this disease for 1909 is .22 per 1,000, and that for all London for the same period .48 per 1000, living. The following table gives the distribution of the deaths from this disease in the different sub-districts of the Borough:— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Measles. 9 10 17 23 Mortality Rate per 1,000 living. .16 .17 .19 .37 During the same period information was received from the head masters of elementary schools of 911 cases of measles occurring amongst their scholars or at the houses of their scholars. In each of these cases a leaflet on the prevention of the spread of measles was despatched to the parent. Whooping Cough.—There were 51 deaths from this cause in the Borough during 1909. This shows an increase of 9 deaths upon the number occurring during 1908. The mortality rate for 1909 from whooping cough is, therefore, .21 per 1,000 persons living. The death rate for all London for the same period is .26 per 1,000 living. 42 The distribution of the disease in the sub-districts of the Borough is given in the following table:— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Whooping Cough. 10 7 20 14 Mortality Rate per 1,000 living. .18 .12 .32 .22 During the year information was received from the head masters of the elementary schools in the Borough of 285 cases of whooping cough either amongst their scholars or at the homes of their scholars. In each of these cases a leaflet on the prevention of the spread of whooping cough was sent to the parent. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. Tuberculosis.—During the year 1909 there were 58 cases of pulmonary phthisis voluntarily notified by medical practitioners practising in Hackney. This is a decline of 44 upon the number voluntarily notified during 1908. There were in addition, however, 354 cases notified under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1909 (see page 64 for further report on these notifications). Bacteriological examination of sputa from 104 cases was made during the same period. In 28 of these the specific bacillus of the disease was discovered, in 73 cases the result of examination was negative, and in 3 cases doubtful. The number of deaths from tuberculous disease occurring in Hackney during 1909 was 395, which are classified as follows:— Tuberculous Phthisis 236 Phthisis 55 43 General Tuberculosis 20 Tuberculous Meningitis 33 „ Peritonitis 32 Tabes Mesenterica 8 Tubercle of other Organs 11 395 This number of deaths gives an annual mortality rate of nearly 1.7 per 1,000 living. The deaths are distributed in the sub-districts of the Borough, as follows:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Tuberculous Disease. 58 86 112 139 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. 1.0 1.5 1.5 2.0 Cancer.—To the different varieties of this disease were attributed 214 deaths during 1909. This shows a decline of 11 deaths upon the number registered during 1908. The annual death rate from cancer for the former year is therefore .91 per 1,000 persons living. The deaths are distributed in the sub-districts in the following proportions:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East.

During 1909 there were 4 deaths registered as due to acute alcoholic poisoning. In addition there were 28 deaths due to cirrhosis of the liver, a condition caused as a rule by excessive indulgence in alcohol, extending over considerable periods. VACCINATION. The following is a summary of the returns made by the Vaccination Officers respecting the vaccination of children whose births were registered in Hackney from the 1st January to 30th June, 1909, with supplementary figures for the year 1908. During the year 1908 there were 5,676 births in the Borough, of which 3,323 appear to have been successfully vaccinated. This amounts to 58.5 per cent. of the total births. During the same period there were 636 certificates of conscientious objections received, and during the year 1909 the statutory declarations of conscientious objection to vaccination which were received, numbered 842. 45 Return made by the Vaccination Officers of the Hackney Union, respecting: the Vaccination of Children whose Births were registered in their Districts from 1st January to 30th June, 1909, inclusive, together with Supplementary Returns for the Year 1908. Registration Sub-districts comprised in the Vaccination Officer's District. Number of Births returned in the "Birth List "Sheets as registered from 1st Jan. to 30th June, 1909. Number of these Births duly entered by 31st January, 1910, in Cols.

(a) Complaints of Nuisances.—During 1909 there were 2,108 complaints of nuisance, etc., made to the Public Health Department, and were investigated by the Sanitary Inspectors of the Borough. About 16 per cent. of these complaints were anonymous; but these received the same consideration as other complaints. Notices were served for the remedy of any defects or the abatement of any nuisances found, upon the person or persons responsible under the above Act. (b) Infectious Disease.—There was a further decrease in 1909 upon the previous year, on the number of houses inspected after infectious disease therein. This, of course, is due to a less prevalence of notifiable infectious disease in the Borough during 1909. The number so inspected was 1,358, being 489 less than the number so inspected during 1908. Whatever sanitary defects or nuisances were found were dealt with in the usual way under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. (c) House to House Inspections.—These are distinct from and in addition to the inspections made under (a) and (b). The year 1909 witnessed a large increase in the number of such inspections over that of 1908. Last year the house to house inspections numbered 2,254. This is an increase of 700 over the number of such inspections made during the previous year. These inspections have been made as in previous years in various parts of the Borough, but chiefly in Homerton, London Fields, De Beauvoir Town, Spring Hill, and Hackney Wick, i.e., the poorer districts of the Borough. Most of the nuisances or defects found on inspection were abated in most cases on the service of intimation notices alone. The total number of such notices served during the year was 4,728. The number of statutory notices served was 429, but it was only necessary to institute legal proceedings in 15 cases to secure compliance with the notices served. This is equal to .32 per cent. of the intimation notices. 47 The following details refer to house to house inspections made by the special inspectors appointed for this work: — House-to-House, Inspections. 1909.—No. 7 District.

DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILK SHOPS. Cow-houses.—The number of licensed cow-keepers in the borough is diminishing rapidly. In the year 1893 there were 45 keepers with 65 cow-sheds. At the end of 1909 there were 21 licensed cow-keepers in the Borough owning 28 cow-sheds. Inspector Bobbitt reports 247 visits of inspection made to these premises during the year, and three intimation notices served for small repairs, which notices were duly complied with. On the 25th September the Public Health Committee made their annual inspection of the cow-houses in the Borough. These were found to be in a satisfactory condition with the exception of two cow-houses where the yard paving was found to be defective. The paving was repaired on the service of a notice. 51 Dairies and Milk Shops.—During the past year 27 milk places were removed from the register and 27 new milk places added, thus the total number on the register at the end of 1909 was the same at the end of 1908. The actual proprietors of milk premises have been changed in 88 cases. Inspector Bobbitt reports that on these visits he discovered 10 dirty utensils. In 5 other instances minor repairs and cleansing were required. The vendors were cautioned against allowing their utensils to remain dirty; and notices were served for the repairs and cleansing. These notices were duly attended to. Offensive Trades.—At the end of 1909 there was only one premises in the Borough licensed to carry on an offensive trade, viz., a tripe boiler. Inspector Bobbitt reports that he made 22 visits of inspection to these premises during the year, and had occasion to serve an intimation on the proprietor for some small repairs which were needed. The notice was immediately attended to. The trade of fish-skin dressing which had been carried on in certain sheds on the land adjacent to the Hackney Marsh has been discontinued and the sheds removed. Slaughter-houses-There were 24 licensed slaughterhouses in the Borough at the end of 1908. During the year 1909 the number was reduced to 21. The private slaughterhouses in Hackney are becoming less every year. In 1893 the total number in Hackney at that time was 38. Inspector Bobbitt reports that he made 384 visits of inspection to the slaughterhouses during 1909. During that time he found it necessary to serve only one intimation notice for some small repairs he thought necessary. On the 25th September the Public Health Committee made their annual inspection of the slaughter-houses of the Borough. In one instance the roof of the slaughter-house d 2 52 was found not to be provided with a gutter to carry off the rain. This was subsequently remedied. The condition of all the remaining slaughter-houses was satisfactory to the Committee at the time of inspection. During his visits to the slaughter-houses, Inspector Bobbitt reports that he examined the carcases of 263 oxen, 2150 sheep and lambs, and 18 pigs. He found the following parts diseased 2 fore quarters with heart and lungs of an ox affected with tuberculosis. 1 carcase of a sheep with all its organs, which had been improperly bled. 7 ox livers affected with Distomatosis. 11 sheep „ „ „ 17 „ „ „ Parasitic Cysts. 11 sheep lungs „ Inflammation. The following statement gives particulars as to the milkplaces, cowsheds, slaughter-houses, and offensive trades in the Borough:—. Premises. Number of Places. Number of Inspections, 1909.

Inspector Bobbitt reports that he made 53 71 visits of inspection to these premises during the year, and found all the meat used sound and free from disease. Smoke Nuisance.—During last year the Smoke Inspector made 1,356 observations of chimneys of factories, workshops, and other places in the Borough. These observations lasted from half-an-hour upwards. The intimation notices served calling attention to this nuisance numbered 37. Water Supply.—Section 48 (2) Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Under this section 40 certificates of proper and sufficient supply of water were issued to owners of new or re-built dwelling houses in the Borough. The certificates refer to 94 houses and tenements. By-laws for Houses let in Lodgings.—During 1909 the whole of the occupied houses in the Borough registered under the above by-laws were inspected. The number registered is 463, of which 22G are situate in Hackney Wick and 237 in the London Fields districts. The following tables give details as to the inspections and the defects found:— HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS, 1909. No. 7 District.

There were only three applications made by owners of tenement properties in the Borough during 1909 to inspect their properties with a view to granting certificates under the above Act, that the tenements were so constructed "as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons dwelling therein, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements," for the purpose of obtaining exemption from Inhabited House Duty. The three applications had reference to ten tenements. These I inspected and granted the required certificates, after the execution of certain necessary alterations. CANAL BOATS ACTS, 1877-1894. Mr. White, the Canal Boats Inspector of the Borough, reports that he made 67 visits to the waterways in the Borough during 1909 and inspected 31 canal boats. Amongst these he found three infringements of the Regulations. On one boat the cabin required re-painting and the registration number on the side renewing, and on the other boat the cabin also required repainting, and there was no registration certificate on board. The remainder of the boats were found to be in good repair, clean and habitable. ICE CREAM VENDORS. During the year 114 premises where ice creams are manufactured were inspected. Defects were discovered in 11 of these 57 premises for the remedy of which notices were served. No further action was required, the defects being immediatelyremedied. At the end of 1909 there were 138 ice cream premises on the Register. GLANDERS AND FARCY ORDER, 1907. During 1909 I received notification from the Veterinary Inspectors of the London County Council of 12 cases of glanders in animals in the Borough of Hackney under the above Order. In each case I had the premises inspected, made enquiries as to the possibility of contagion spreading to the stablemen, etc.; but in no case did it appear that the disease had been conveyed to human beings. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS, 1890-1903. No representation was made to the local authority under the above Acts during the year 1909. THE RIVER LEA. Owing to the low atmospheric temperature of the summer months of 1909, there was an absence of complaints of nuisance from this river. PUBLIC HEALTH LEGISLATION, 1909. SUMMARY OF HOUSING, TOWN PLANNING, &c. ACT, l909. Part 1. Sec. 1 to 9. This part of the Act makes Part III. of the principal Act to take effect as if it had been adopted. It also provides facilities for the acquisition of lands for purposes of Part III. of the principal Act. Also for loans made by the Public 58 Works Loans Commissioners to local authorities and to public utility societies; the payment of purchase or compensation money on direction of Local Government Board; makes provision for making public streets in connection with exercise of their powers in connection with Part III. of the principal Act; provides for the expenditure of money for housing purposes in case of settled land; enables local authorities to accept donations of land or money on other property for housing purposes; makes provision with respect to money applicable under trusts for housing purposes. Sec. 10. Provides that so far as concerns Metropolitan Boroughs the Local Government Board has power where a local authority has failed to exercise their powers under Part II. or III. of the principal Act, where these powers ought to have been exercised after complaint to them of at least four householders, to cause a local enquiry to be held, and if necessary to make an order on the local authority directing them within a specified period to do certain things for the purpose of remedying their default. Such an order may be enforced by mandamus. Sec. 11. Provides where a local authority has failed to carry out an improvement scheme under Part I. of the principal Act or failed to give effect to an order as respects an obstructive building or to a reconstruction scheme under Part II. of that Act, the Board may make an order upon the local authority for such schemes to be carried out within a limited time. Sec. 14. Extends Section 75 of the principal Act, that is, that in any contract made after December 3rd, 1909, for letting a house for habitation where the rent does not exceed £40 per annum, there shall be implied the condition that the house is at the commencement of the holding in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. Sec. 15. Provides that such house shall during the holding be kept by the landlord in all respects reasonably fit for human 59 habitation, and gives authority to the landlord or local authorities at all reasonable times to enter such premises after giving 24 hours notice for the purpose of viewing its condition. If the above undertaking is not complied with the local authority may by a written notice require the landlord within a reasonable time, not less than 21 days, to execute such works as may be specified and to make the house fit for human habitation. The landlord may within 21 days of receipt of such notice by a written notice to the local authority declare his intention of closing the house for human habitation, and thereupon a closing order shall be deemed to have become operative. If the notice given by the local authority is not complied with and the landlord has not given any notice of intention to close the house, the local authority may enter at the expiration of the time given in their notice to the landlord, and do the work required and recover the expenses from the landlord as a civil debt in the manner provided by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. The landlord is given a right of appeal to the Local Government Board against any notice to do works or against any demand for recovery of expenses, within 21 days after the notice is received or the demand for the recovery of expenses is made. In this section landlord is defined as "any person who lets to a tenant for habitation the house under any contract referred to in this section," and included his successors in title; and the expression "house" includes part of a house. Sections 40 and 50 of the principal Act as amended by Section 13 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903, (relating to service of notices and description of owner in proceedings) shall apply to this section, with the substitution where required, of the landlord for the owner of a dwelling house. Sec. 16. Extends the power of making by-laws with respect to houses let in lodgings to the making of by-laws with respect to 60 houses intended for the working class. Such by-laws may impose any duty involving the execution of work upon the owner in addition to or in substitution for any other person having an interest in the premises. This Section also provides for the entry of the owner or other persons upon the premises at all reasonable times. Also provides in default of owner or other person required to execute work under the by-laws, for the local authority doing the necessary work and recovering costs and expenses. Sec. 17. Supersedes section 32 of the principal Act and sets out the duty of the local authority with respect to closing and demolition orders. This gives the local authority power to prohibit by an order the use of a dwelling house for human occupation, where from information received such premises appear to them to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for occupation. An owner aggrieved by the order may appeal to the Local Government Board. This Section also provides, where a closing order has been made, for a copy of the same to be served upon every occupying tenant; also for the payment in certain cases of a reasonable allowance to the tenants on account of expenses in removing. When the local authority are satisfied that the dwelling house has been made fit for habitation they may determine a closing order, and if the local authority refuse on the application of an owner to determine a closing order he may appeal to the Local Government Board. By sub-section (7) special provisions are made in regard to underground rooms habitually used as sleeping places. These are 61 to be regarded as unfit for human habitation unless they conform to the following conditions:— (a) The room must be on an average at least seven feet in height from floor to ceiling. (b) It must comply with certain regulations to be made by the local authoritiy for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of such rooms and the protection of the same against dampness, effluvia or exhalation. In default of the local authority the Local Government Board may make such regulations and they shall have effect as if made by the local authority. It is further provided that a closing order made in respect of such an underground room shall not prevent the room being used for purposes other than those of a sleeping place. This sub-section does not come into operation until 1st July, 1910. Sec. 18. Provides the procedure to be adopted before making an order for the demolition of a dwelling in respect of which a closing order has remained operative for a period of three months. Notice of an order for the demolition of a building shall be forthwith served on every owner of the building in respect of which it is made, and such owner or owners may appeal to the Local Government Board by the giving of proper notice to the Board. Sec. 19. Gives power to redeem annuities charged by charging order under Section 36 of the principal Act. Sec. 20. Makes provision as to priority of charges under Section 37 of the principal Act. Sec. 21. Restricts the power of Court of Summary Jurisdiction to extend time. 62 Sections 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29, are concerned with amendments with respect to Improvement and Reconstruction Schemes. Sections 30 to 34 deal with amendments with respect to financial matters. Sec. 35. Provides that under certain circumstances Common Lodging Houses occupied for the sole purpose of letting lodgings to persons of the working classes at a charge of not exceeding sixpence a night for each person shall be exempt from Inhabited House Duty. Sections 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42, deal respectively with the power of entry upon premises; the power of the Local Government Board to obtain a report on any crowded area; joint action by local authorities, appeals to the Local Government Board; sale and disposal of dwellings; power to prescribe and dispense with advertisements and notices; and publication of schemes or order in the London Gazette. Sec. 43. Prohibits the erection of any back to back houses intended to be used as dwellings for the working classes. Provided this section shall not apply to a house containing several tenements in which the tenements are placed back to back, if the Medical Officer of Health for the district certifies that the several tenements are so constructed and arranged as to secure effective ventilation of all habitable rooms in every tenement, or to any houses abutting on any streets the plans whereof have been approved by the local authority before the 1st May, 1909, in any Borough or district in which at the passing of this Act back to back houses may be lawfully erected. Sec. 44. Gives power to the Local Government Board to Tevoke unreasonable by-laws. 63 Sec. 45. Has reference to the saving of sites of ancient monuments. Sec. 46.—Deals with other minor amendments of Housing Acts. Sections 47, 48, 49, 50 and 51, define the terms used in the Act. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1909. ACCOMMODATION FOR STORAGE OF FOOD. 1909. Part III., SEC. 16, 17, 18. Accommodation for storage of food. SEC. 16. Gives power to a sanitary authority to require the owner of a house let out in tenements to provide for the use of each family occupying such house sufficient and suitable accommodation for the storage of food if such provision is practicable. This section shall not apply to any tenement house used, or occupied, as such before the passing of this Act. Sec. 17. Applies the following sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to this part of this Act, viz., SECS. 101, 112, 115, 116, 117, 118, 121, 122, 124, 125, 127, 128, 133, 135. Sec. 18. Gives power to a sanitary authority to enter any tenement house at all reasonable times for the purpose of ascertaining what accommodation for the storage of food is provided, and whether there is any contravention of the provisions of this part of this Act. Sec. 19. Gives power to the owner of premises to enter, notwithstanding the provisions of lease, for the purpose of 64 plying with any of the provisions of this part of this Act or with the requirements of any notice given under the provisions of this part of this Act. PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1909. These regulations first came into operation on the 1st of January, 1909, and it will be remembered that the object of the regulations is to secure notification of all cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis to the Medical Officer of Health, brought to the knowledge of the Poor Law Medical Officers, in order that suitable measures may be taken by the local Authority on the advice of their Medical Officer of Health, to prevent the spread of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. During the year in question 354 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis were notified one or more times. The following tabie shows the sex and ages of these cases:— Ages and Sex of Notified Cases. Ages- Under 15 years. 15 to 25 years. 25 to 35 years. 35 to 45 years. 45 years and upwards. Totals. Males 20 23 47 65 97 252 Females 11 14 18 20 37 102 Totals 31 37 65 85 138 354 The number of notifications received in connection with these 354 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis amounted to 749. This is on an average rather more than two notifications to each case; 65 but, as a matter of fact, the number of times a case was notified during the year varied from one to eleven, as follows:— No. of Notification received for each case. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 11 Total. No. of Cases 147 112 47 22 18 3 3 1 1 354 Of this number, again, 12 cases were notified from Common Lodging Houses in the Borough, and 36 cases were notified from the Workhouse and Casual Wards. Of the number of 354 cases of pulmonary consumption notified under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 139 died during the year. The total number of deaths from this disease in the whole Borough during the year 1909 was 291. Thus 139 deaths, or 47.7 per cent. of the total deaths occurred amongst cases notified under the P.H. (T.) Regulations. Can we, from these figures, obtain any idea, even only approximately, of the prevalence of this disease in the Borough? By applying these figures to the whole of Hackney we should get a total of 740 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis existing in the Borough; but I do not think this figure represents the total number because cases notified under the Regulations are certainly the most advanced cases of the disease, and the annual death-rate amongst these would be much higher. Making allowance for this I am of opinion that the number of persons living in the Borough of Hackney and actually suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis is certainly 1,000, and probably many more, or, at least, one case in every 240 of the population. Enquiries were made into the circumstances, surroundings -and habits of life of many of the cases notified during the year as had not been removed to the infirmary or similar institution. The object of these enquiries was to ascertain what effect these e 66 circumstances, etc., might be exercising in relation to the spread of the disease; and also more clearly to see the directions along which measures should be carried in order to prevent infection spreading. Amongst the 354 cases of tuberculosis notified, there were 169 which were either in the infirmary or were removed there almost immediately after notification and about whom I could get no reliable information. There were also 48 cases notified from Common Lodging Houses, Casual Wards, or Workhouses; the remaining 137 were cases about whom I could obtain a certain amount of information. The information obtained may be grouped under the following heads:—(a) Occupation; (b) Sleeping arrangements; (c) Precautions respecting expectoration; (d) As to the use of separate eating and drinking utensils; (e) Ventilation of bed-room. (a) Occupations.—Not in every case could information be obtained as to the present or past occupation of these cases. Only in 20 female and 79 male cases could that information be obtained. Of the females, 7 were, or had been, charwomen, 2 laundry women, 3 waitresses, 2 worked in the boot trade, and 1 each worked at the following: Mantle making, millinery, machinist, printing, fancy paper work, seamstress. Of the 79 males, it was ascertained that 12 were, or had been, labourers, 13 worked at the boot trade, 5 clerks, 4 carmen, 3 porters, 3 printers, 2 had followed each of the following trades, e.g. stoker, hawker, brush-making, mechanic, piano making, electric wire mail, painter, bargeman; and one each had been employed as follows: e.g. soldier, brassworker, barber, cooper, lamplighter, postman, fish-curer, packer, cabinet maker, window cleaner, baker, paperhanger, coachman, tinsmith, bottle-maker, dustman, dyer, engineer, turner, butcher, stableman, carpenter, tailor. (b) Sleeping Arrangements.—Enquiry under this head revealed the fact that out of a total of 135 cases of whom information could be obtained, 42 only had a bedroom apart from other 67 members of the family, and 93 cases shared the bedroom with other members of the family. Of these 93, there were 74 who shared their bedroom with one other person alone, 9 shared it with 2 others, 6 with 3 others, and 4 with 4 other persons in the same bedroom. Further, amongst these 93 cases, there were 64 cases who shared their bed with other members of the family; 60 of these had only one other occupant of their bed and 4 had 2 other occupants. (c) Precautions Respecting Expectoration.—Definite information under this head was obtainable in the case of 122 persons. Of this number, 67 apparently took no precautions whatever, 38 made use of a spit-cup or some other receptacle for the reception of the sputa at home, and 17 used a spit-cup both at home and out of doors. (d) Precautions as to the use of Separate Eating and Drinking Utensils—It is important that tuberculous persons should have their eating and drinking utensils separate from those used by the remainder of the family. Of 122 tuberculous patients 79 stated that they each had such separate utensils reserved for their use alone, and 43 were said to use such utensils in common with those used by other members of their families. (e) Ventilation of the Bedroom.—In all cases in which enquiry was made as to this, it appears that means of ventilation was provided, the bedrooms having a fireplace and chimney flue, with windows made to open, and, if necessary, to be kept open; but it is doubtful if such ventilation was maintained except in a few instances. When one remembers the chief mode of spread of tuberculosis, by means of the expectoration, and how much the chances of infection are increased by close association of the diseased with the healthy, and by the absence of certain precautions, it e 2 68 cannot excite surprise that this disease should continue to spread amongst the working classes after consideration of the facts detailed under (b) (c) (d) (e) above. It will be remembered that all of these patients were in receipt of poor law medical relief. Whatever they may have been earlier, they had drifted into this class at last. And it seems as if this must be so with the bulk of the cases occurring amongst the working classes. Pulmonary consumption is, in most cases, a chronic disease, lasting, it may be, years. If the breadwinner of a family is attacked, his family begin immediately to suffer in their social and domestic circumstances; for he soon becomes incapable of the necessary exertion to maintain his family, as before the onset of his illness. Most working people have no reserve to meet emergencies like a long illness. The status of the patient and his family suffers, he ceases to work regularly, his income declines, and he becomes too poor to afford nourishment for himself and family. His ability to pay for medical attendance and treatment ceases. The members of his family may not be capable of work, or work may not be obtainable. They and most of their families drift into the class receiving poor law relief. Such is briefly the course of a case of pulmonary consumption amongst the working classes. When poverty stares both the patient and his family in the face, then the nutrition of all suffer, and the otherwise healthy members of the family fall easier victims to the infection of the patient. If the nutrition of those surrounding the patient at home could be maintained, they would not be so readily attacked by the germs of the disease. Poverty reduces the resistance of everybody to the onset of disease, because it reduces nutrition and the natural immunity possessed more or less by every healthy organism. Another point to remember is that when poverty attacks a family the housing accommodation reduced to a minimum; they crowd into dwellings too small 69 for healthy living. Means are insufficient to afford a separate bedroom, or even a separate bed, for the patient, or for providing receptacles for the reception of sputa. Fuel for maintaining the home at a reasonable temperature is difficult to obtain, consequently ventilation is restricted. Again, separate eating and drinking utensils for the sufferer are from the same cause unobtainable. So that when a working man becomes tuberculous it may excite no wonder that he becomes the centre of infection to his family, and that other members of the family acquire the disease if he is treated for his malady at home. The question of prevention of the spread of tuberculosis is bound up with the question of dealing with the poverty incident with the onset of the disease. The Local Authority has power to do certain things for the prevention of the spread of infection from this disease. The following quotation from Article IX. of the Regulations already referred to sets out these powers:— ARTICLE IX. (2) Subject as aforesaid, a Council, on the advice of their Medical Officer of Health, in the case of a poor person in relation to whom a notification in pursuance of these Regulations, has been posted to the Medical Officer of Health, may, for the purpose of preventing the spread of infection from Pulmonary Tuberculosis,— (a) Take all such measures, or do all such things as are authorised, in any case of infectious disease, or of dangerous infectious disease, by any enactment relating to public health, and as have reference to the destruction and disinfection of infected articles, or the cleansing or disinfecting of premises. 70 (b) Take all such measures or do all such things as are appropriate and necessary for the safe disposal or detraction of infectious material, produced and discharged as a result of Pulmonary Tuberculosis; and otherwise for the prevention of the spread of infection from any such material. (c) Afford or supply all such assistance, facilities, or articles as, within such reasonable limits as the circumstances of the case require and allow, will obviate, or remove, or diminish the risk of infection arising from the conditions affecting the use or occupation of any room, when used or occupied by the poor person as a sleeping apartment; and (d) Furnish, for the use of the poor person, on loan, or otherwise, any appliance, apparatus, or utensil which will be of assistance for the purpose of any precaution against the spread of infection. (3). A Council, on the advice of their Medical Officer of Health, may provide and publish or distribute in the form of placards, handbills, or leaflets, suitable summaries of information and instruction respecting Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and the precautions to be taken against the spread of infection from that disease. Measures Taken During the Year.—(1) The disinfection of every room occupied by a tuberculous person, and any infected articles, either after removal to some institution or after death. The number of such disinfected during 1909 was 247. (2) On the notification of a case under the Regulations, a visit of enquiry is made by one of the Sanitary Inspectors, and a printed leaflet of advice is sent to each patient 71 (3) Arrangements have been made for the gratuitous bacteriological examination of sputa sent by any medical practitioner practising in the Borough. The number of such examinations made during the year was 104. The ward accommodation provided by the Guardians of the Hackney Union for cases of pulmonary consumption is as follows:— Male patients, 57 beds in 4 wards. Female patients, 30 beds in 1 ward. The Medical Superintendent states that:— "Having regard to our limited accommodation, it is difficult to provide the sub-classification of earlier and advanced cases that I should like to enforce if I had the available space. The Guardians are shortly opening Pavilion 'D; and are arranging to erect an additional Pavilion 'C; When this additional accommodation is available I hope to be able to make arrangements for a full sub-classification." I am further informed by the Clerk to the Guardians that:— "The Guardians send suitable cases requiring sanatorium treatment to the seaside sanatoria at Sandgate. The following phthisical patients were at Sandgate on the 11th inst (December, 1909), viz., 5 males and 1 female." THE FEEDING OF NECESSITOUS CHILDREN AND THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF SCHOOL CHILDREN AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE. There is no doubt that during the past year infectious disease, especially scarlet fever and diphtheria, has been below the average in the Borough, more so than I can remember for some years past, regard being paid to its increasing density and 72 the increasing accumulation of susceptible individuals to infectious disease. I do not think this falling off is wholly due to one or all of the following causes, viz., a decrease in numbers of children at susceptible ages, or to the exhaustion of the supply of susceptible children, or to that cyclical fall which occurs every few years during the progress of infectious diseases, but largely to certain circumstances called into opera tion during recent years in connection with the education of elementary school children. I do not claim the whole of the observed decrease to the circumstances referred to, but I am of opinion they have operated favourably during the past year, and will continue to do so more and more in the reduction of infectious disease in proportion as they are applied to school children in the future. The circumstances I refer to are:— 1st. The feeding of necessitous schoolchildren. 2nd. The medical examination of schoolchildren, with subsequent removal of adenoids and enlarged tonsils or other unhealthy throat affections. (1). The feeding of necessitous schoolchildren has now found a place in the scheme of school education for London. Originally the meals were provided by voluntary effort, and even now a great deal of voluntary assistance is given in connection with the scheme. The original ground upon which the feeding of underfed children was based, was entirely an educational one. It was said, and with justice, that children who were underfed could not, owing to physical incapacity, take full advantage of the educational facilities provided for them. This view finds expression in the following extract from the Education (Provision or Meals) Act, 1906:— SEC. 3. Where the local education authority resolve 73 that any of the children attending an elementary school within their area are unable by lack of food to take full advantage of the education provided for them, and have ascertained that funds other than public funds are not available or are insufficient in amount, etc., etc." This quotation lays stress upon the inability of the child to study when underfed, and assumes that with sufficient and proper feeding children will be able to take full advantage of the educational facilities afforded to them. While fully agreeing with this view of the question, I am of opinion that other important results may reasonably be expected to follow the feeding of necessitous childien; that with a general improvement in health, there will be acquired pari passu an increased resistance to epidemic disease. In considering the results of feeding necessitous children from this latter point of view, certain facts must be borne in mind. First, it must be remembered that for infectious disease to spread, it is necessary that not only must facilities for spreading the disease be present, but there must also be present a sufficient number of susceptible persons exposed to infection, and if there is a decline in the prevalence of infectious disease, there is either less intercourse between persons at susceptible ages, or such persons are less susceptible than formerly, or there is a less number of such persons present. I do not think much need be said to disprove the last point. The birth-rate in the Borough has kept fairly constant during the last few years, and so supplying a constant stream of susceptible persons; and, again, scarlet fever and diphtheria, with which I am here mostly concerned, have not been so excessive in the Borough during the last two or three years as to use up all 74 the available susceptible persons. Again, there is no evidence that intercourse amongst school children is less frequent and active than it was in the past, so that I fall back provisionally, at any rate, upon the hypothesis that the lessened incidence of infectious disease is due to an increase in the natural insusceptibility or immunity present in all children in varying degrees. In considering how this has been brought about, it must be remembered that infectious disease is usually most prevalent in the poorest and consequently most crowded localities, amongst children who are not too well nourished, housed or clothed. Such children more easily fall victims to any prevalent infection than the children of better circumstanced parents, because of their lessened resistance to invasion. It is well known, and it has been proved experimentally, that starvation, unsuitable diet, fatigue or exposure to excessive heat, cold or moisture, will reduce the insusceptibility of certain animals to certain infectious diseases, and it is not unreasonable that these agencies will be followed by the same results if acting upon the human organism. It is also known that by improvement in the general health the natural immunity against disease is increased, and there is no more certain method of improving the general health of under-fed persons that by proper and sufficient dieting. This has been carried out in this Borough on a considerable scale during the last two years, and I am inclined to believe that the effect of such feeding is showing itself in a diminution of infectious disease, especially in that of scarlet fever and diphtheria. (2) The medical examination of school children with resulting treatment is no doubt also exercising a beneficial effect upon their general health, and will continue to act in this way so long as it is continued; but I believe there is a special effect being brought about by treatment directed to the removal of adenoids and enlarged tonsils and the correction of unhealthy 75 conditions of the throat, all of which are commonly found in children at school ages. It is well known that an unhealthy condition of the throat predisposes to such infectious diseases as diphtheria and scarlet fever. The presence of enlarged tonsils or adenoids, or both, will set up such an unhealthy condition. It is in such throats that the micro-organisms of these diseases find a favourable soil for their growth and development, and it is quite reasonable to believe that with the removal of conditions favourable to the growth of the organisms of infectious disease, there will be a diminution in their prevalence. I believe that such a result has already in some degree been effected, and that in the future we may expect to see a greater diminution in the prevalence of the infectious diseases, scarlet fever and diphtheria, due largely to the two circumstances above discussed. 76 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901.

She also made 1,399 visits without inspection, the outworker having either moved to another address (775), or having given up work (156), or not being at home (238), or owing to wrong address being given (148), etc. During her visits Miss Portlock discovered 56 workshops which had not been registered, and 23 premises where male outworkersalone were employed. Admission was refused by outworkers to this Inspector on three occasions during the year, but she was admitted on a subsequent visit, after I had addressed a cautionary letter to the respective outworkers. During Miss Portlock's inspections she discovered 590 premises in which there were sanitary defects. For the abatement of these 267 intimation notices and 6 statutory notices were served. Of the 875 premises inspected by Miss Portlock, in 87 only did she find a room set apart for work alone. In the remainder, work was carried on in rooms used for other purposes as set out below:— Workroom, bedroom and kitchen 123 „ and kitchen 444 „ „ bedroom 94 „ „ living room 118 „ „ scullery 8 „ „ basement passage 1 „ alone 87 875 The following table gives the general character of the nuisances found, with other details. 85 NUISANCES IN OUTWORKERS' PREMISES, 1909.

The average duration of stay in the shelter was 2.1 days. The table on page 94 gives further particulars relating to these contacts. No expenses were incurred in the conveyance of persons to and fiom the shelter during last year. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897. The facilities afforded by the Borough Council under the above Act for the cleansing of verminous persons were taken advantage of during 1909 to such an extent that 667 persons presented themselves at the station for cleansing.

The refuse removed during the year 1909 from houses in the Borough to the Destructor, Millfields Road, by the appointed Contractors amounted to 39,216 tons, 17 cwts., and 2 qrs. From the North Division 17;762 tons, 2 qrs., 21 lbs., and from the South Division 21,454 tons, 16 cwts, 3 qrs,, and 7 lbs were removed at the rate of 4s. 6d. per ton for the months of January, February and March, and 4s. 5d. per ton for the remaining months of 1909. The total amount of house refuse removed during the whole year from the whole Borough shows an increase of nearly 648 tons and a total increase in cost of £209 17s. 3d. This increase in cost is only partly due to increased tonnage, the chief cause being due to increased prices charged by the Contractors. The cost of disposal of the house refuse removed to the destructor during 1909, which includes the destruction of the refuse by fire and the disposal of clinker arising from the refuse, together with tins and other non-combustible material, has been estimated by the Borough Engineer at the rate of 36.12 pence per ton for the 1st quarter of the year, and 36 43 pence per ton for the remaining g 2 100 three quarters of the year, bringing the cost for the disposal alone of house refuse during the year to a total of £5,937 19s. 10d. This sum added to the cost of removal brings the total cost of removal and disposal of the house refuse during 1909 to the grand total of £14,645 19s. 7d. Distributing this total cost for the year over the estimated population of the Borough, it amounts to nearly 1s. 2¾d per head.

REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH On Allegations made by the Social Democratic Party concerning Insanitary Properties in the Borough of Hackney, 24th November, 1908. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E., April, 1909. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, In accordance with your instructions to inquire into the allegations of the Social Democratic Party as to insanitary property in Hackney, contained in their letter of 24th November, 1908, and to report thereon, I beg herewith to submit the reports of inspections of the property, with certain observations of my own upon the subject of your reference. I have in the first place to state that my attention was first drawn to this subject by the statement of the Social Democratic Party appearing in one of the local newspapers. I immediately caused an inspection to be made by the Sanitary Inspectors in whose districts the property was situate. Annexed is a copy of the statement of the Social Democratic Party, together with the reports of the Sanitary Inspectors thereon. For convenience of reference, I have numbered the various places mentioned. The dates of inspections made by the Inspectors are also given with their reports. On careful com- H 114 parison of the Sanitary Inspectors' reports with the complaints of the Social Democratic Party, it will be observed: — 1. That a considerable number of the latter are either imaginary or greatly exaggerated. I refer to complaints Nos. 2, 3, 4. 8, 10, 11, 14, 17, 21, 22 and 23. 2. Throughout the whole of the complaints there are certain kinds of dilapidations and defects, constituting a large part of the total, made specially prominent, such as broken glass, broken chimney pots, no fences between yards, defective brick work, broken grates, broken coppers, soiled paint and varnish, old or broken locks to doors, defective hearthstones. Where any structure is dangerous to life or limb it is a matter to be dealt with by the District Surveyor under the London County Council, but if the matter can be regarded as dangerous or injurious to health the Borough Council would be the Authority to see to its abatement. But looking through the above list of defects, it will be seen that however desirous one may be to remedy the whole, most of them cannot be regarded as dangerous or injurious to health, and others are only remotely or doubtfully related to health. 3. After deducting the complaints under the heads 1 and 2, we find that the Inspectors discovered a number of genuine defects which are related to health, and which can be dealt with by the Borough Council, but which are not numerous, and taken singly are not serious defects. Amongst these are: a Defective roofs, (b) Ceilings dirty, (c) Walls dirty. (d) Yard paving defective. (e) Defective eaves gutters and rain water pipes. (/) Defective flush cisterns, (g) Defective plaster on walls and ceilings. (h) Defective w.c. pans. 4. It appears hardly necessary to point out the poverty of certain tenants, which is mentioned amongst the complaints, 115 not be remedied by the Borough Council under the powers of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which alone enables them to call for the abatement of nuisances dangerous or injurious to health. 5. It is necessary to specially refer to Tranby Court. It will be in the memory of the Committee that in 1905 I represented this property under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1890-1903, as unfit for habitation, and on the instruction of the Public Health Committee legal proceedings were taken to close them; but the Magistrate, after hearing evidence on behalf of the Borough Council, adjourned the summonses sine die, to enable the defendants, who pleaded that they could effect such improvements in the dwellings as would render them fit for occupation, to submit to the Public Health Committee a specification of their proposal. These proposals were accepted by the Public Health Committee as likely to remove the insanitary conditions complained of, and render the dwellings fit for occupation. The works were completed and the cottages re-occupied in the month of July, 1905. (A summary of the specifications submitted by the owner of this property is given in my Annual Report for 1905.) I may add that after the inspections of the properties abovementioned the Inspectors served notices on the persons responsible to remedy the insanitary conditions found. These have now almost all been remedied. J. KING-WARRY, M.D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health. h 2 116 Social Democratic Party's Notes on Visits to Workmen's Houses in Hackney, 21st to 22nd November, 1908. 1. 271, Glyn Road.—Front room basement flooring rotten, when a person sits on a chair, the chair legs go through the floor. Passage flooring decayed. Scullery roof leaks. Internal painting required throughout the house. Plaster skirting crumbling away. Upper part of house requires re-papering. 2. 18, Crozier Terrace.—A starved woman at this house would not give admittance. She did not wish her poverty to be known, but reported bad ceilings throughout the house. As regards this street in general, on one side the houses are being renovated (preparatory to their use by the Guardians), but on the side still occupied by weekly tenants there are many unsound windows in the houses. To obtain the best idea of the character of this property the visitor should go through Bones Cotts. into the rope yard between the backs of the houses in Crozier Terrace and Nisbet Street. It will be seen that fences are broken, windows boarded or stuffed with rag, chimney pots falling off, and the wall dividing the Crozier Terrace yards from the rope yard is tumbling down. Doors to water closets are either absent, without hinges, or have been cut to pieces. The yards require making up and every wall needs limewashing It would be difficult to find a sadder example of dilapidation than the rear of Crozier Terrace. 3. Nisbet Street—The rear of the houses in Nisbet Street are not so bad as in Crozier Terrace, but many windows are boarded or stuffed. The roofs are in a bad state of repair, chimney pots broken, and limewashing is generally needed. At 117 Results of Inspections by Sanitary Inspectors, November 30th, December 1st and 2nd, 1908. 1. 271, Glyn Road.—Three holes in basement front room floor about 4 square inches each. Two holes in basement passage floor. one about 12 square inches, one about 6 square inches. Walls and ceilings throughout the building in a fair condition. Scullery and main roofs defective. Small portion of plaster skirting broken in first floor passage Defective lid and front to dust bin. Inspected previously June 22nd, 1909. 2. Crozier Terrace.-I found there was no fence between the yards of Nos. 17 and 18. Eight windows had broken glass and were covered with boards or paper out of 116. One chimney pot broken. Wall at bottom of yards abutting on rope yard in a dilapidated condition. Some of the yards would be improved by having a load of clinker, also some limewashing would improve their appearance. Inspected previously 1907. No. 18. Ceiling of F.F.F., G.F.B., passage and staircase dirty, yard paving defective, w.c. dirty and dilapidated walls. All w.c.'s had doors with hinges. 3. Nisbet Street.-I found three windows with broken glass which were boarded up or covered with paper out of 115.

All flags broken in yard. No fence. No dust bin. Walls want re-pointing. Gutter is broken, scullery floor decayed and sash lines broken. 4. 3, Tranby Place.—Broken hearth and oven, seriously requires painting throughout. The house is almost without furniture of any kind. All children barefooted, one with large blister on foot due to nail in boots she must wear to attend school. Emaciated baby of about 15 months on an old couch. Want of food has caused the skin to tighten on the skull and the child now carries a perpetual grin. The Borough Council should visit Tranby Place, the members should go and smell it. The paving of the Court is broken and very uneven. Half-way down the Court one is met by a horrible stench from water closets at the end. Children were playing in these water closets. There is one copper for eight houses—that is to say the accommodation for washing is absolutely inadequate. There is one dustbin for the Court which contains sixteen houses. 5. Wick Road (Lower end).—The external condition of houses in this road is bad. There are many defective roofs, fallen gutters and broken windows. No. 431 has no gutter. Asphalte paving requires renewal. There is insufficient and improper arrangements for the escapement of water from the roofs of projecting windows of rooms on the ground floor. 119 present empty) three chimney pots broken.

Defective eaves guttering at No. 42, defective paving of washhouse, broken sash line of kitchen window. 4. 3, Tranby Place.-I found the corner of the hearth (concrete) broken, also no hasp to fasten the dcor of oven, paint on skirting and door worn off in places. Paving of yard requires repairing. There is one w.c. for each house. There is an iron portable copper for washing for the use of Nos. 1 to 8, and for Nos. 10 to 16 a copper for each two houses is built at the rear. There are two dust bins for the Court. No horrible smell at time of visit from w.c.'s. Is visited every week. 5. Wick Road (Lower end).—No. 435. Gutters of main roof and windows broken, forecourt paving broken (house empty). No. 433.

The copper is in kitchen, which is used as a dwelling room. Lodgers have to use the kitchen, and the continuous presence of steam and damp in the rooms has caused bronchitis in a child living there. 9. 95, Holly Street.—Cistern leaks, seat of w.c. soddened with water, kitchen ceiling falling in, plaster coming from laths. The bars of the grate are broken, hearth perished and the floor weak. The copper is perished, and the walls over the copper are falling. There is a sink but no outlet for water. When the kitchen was last redecorated the tenant did it at his own expense; it now requires re-papering and painting. In the front room the ceiling needs white-washing and the walls re-papering; 121 in connection with roofs of bays to windows on ground floor to carry off water. Enquiries as to leaky roofs on premises find roofs not leaky. Nos. 411 to 419. All work just completed. 6. Berkshire Road.—No. 104. Window sill abutting on street, small piece broken off. No. 108.

In the bedroom a fire is impossible, the stove being in such a broken condition. As regards the passage, the woman living in the house says, "Cannot let the children play in the passage because the falling pieces of ceiling get in their eyes." The walls of the passage are crumbling. The rent of this house is l5s. weekly. The present tenant has lived there four years, and has never seen a Sanitary Inspector. 10. 101, Holly Street.—Passage, lath and plaster decayed. In the rooms the window frames are rotten, and the stoves worn out and broken. In the back room on the ground floor the ceiling recently fell on a child when in bed.

Spring Hill District (near River Lea and Middlesex Wharf).—The dilapidated condition of this property is well known. It is doubtful whether the houses could be made truly desirable habitations, as proximity to the river and the flooding that can only be avoided by re-embankment, makes dampness a chronic condition of the houses at the foot of the hill. The houses generally are in need of much internal and external repair. The roadway at Middlesex Wharf near Lea Bridge Road is an abomination on wet days. 129 ing and walls of this room fairly clean. Two rooms overcrowded. Mr. G., the tenant at the time of the inspection, has since left.

I 2 132 I beg to report further that on the 8th instant I received the following communication from Mr. E. C. Fairchild:— "13, Clifden Road, Clapton, N.E. "19th April, 1909. "Dear Sir, "In the report on insanitary properties in Hackney presented by the Social Democratic Party to the Special Committee of the Borough Council on November 23rd, 1908, and signed by Mr. A. Inkpin and myself, we state that 41, Dyssell Street is in a condition injurious to the health of the inhabitants. "We beg to state that the number intended is 4, not 41, which was erroneously introduced into the report. "I am, "Yours faithfully. "(Signed) E. C. Fairchild." I immediately caused an inspection of No. 4, Dyssell Street to be made, and below will be seen the report of the Inspector upon the sanitary condition of the premises, together with the statement as to its condition made by the Social Democratic Party. No. 4, Dyssell Street.—Report of Social Democratic Party— The kitchen here apparently has been patched up, the repairs are incomplete. A new stove is wanted upstairs, plaster and paper is falling. New ceilings wanted in the top front room where paper is hanging from the walls. Sash cords gone. The daughter of the woman in the house is to be married after Christmas. She has asked for the rooms to be done up as she would not like her son-in-law's relations to see the house as at present The landlord may do the front room. The stairs here are very much decayed. 133 No. 4, Dyssell Street.—Report of Sanitary Inspector— Top plates broken of both kitchen stoves; first floor back walls dirty and dilapidated; no means of fastening yard door; a hole in wall of W.C. 134 I also append copy of my report of the action taken with respect to the dwelling houses in Tranby Place, Homerton, under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890-1903, for the information of the Committee. J. KING WARRY, M.D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS, 1890-1903. In the month of February I made the following representations under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. Town Hall, Hackney, N.E., 2nd February, 1905. To the Public Health Committee, Gentlemen, I beg to report to you, in pursuance of Section 32 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, that on the 10th day of January last, I inspected the dwelling houses situate at and known as 1—16, Tranby Place, Homerton, within your district, and of which Henry Bainton, 17, May Road, The Green, Twickenham, is the owner. I found such dwelling houses to be in the state hereinafter set forth, which in my opinion axe so dangerous or injurious to health that the said houses are unfit for human habitation In my opinion, the said dwelling houses are not capable of being made fit for human habitation, and are in such a state that the occupation thereof should be immediately discontinued. 135 State of Dwelling Houses. 1. Badly and closely arranged in a narrow court, causing want of light, air, and ventilation. 2. Insufficient through ventilation. 3. Damp walls. 4. Insufficient sanitary conveniences. 5. Insufficient water supply. 6. Defective drains. 7. Generally decayed. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. KING WARRY, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. The Public Health Committee, after the consideration of this representation, resolved that legal proceedings should be taken to close these dwellings. Summonses were issued against the owners, which were heard at the North London Police Court on the 5th of April. The Magistrate after hearing evidence on behalf of the Borough Council, adjourned the summonses sine die, to enable the defendants, who pleaded that they could effect such improvements in the dwellings as would render them fit for occupation, to submit to the Public Health Committee a specification of their proposals. The following is a summary of these proposals:— Roofs.—Repair roofs, gutters and parapet walls, and render them waterproof. Walls.—Re-point the whole of the walls with Portland cement and sand, and repair and make good all cement plinths. 136 Damp Course.—Lay in a proper damp course above the footings where necessary, consisting of two courses of slates laid with break joints in Portland cement and sand. Ventilation under Floors.—Remove existing floors and excavate ground where necessary to a depth of two feet below floor line, and cover where necessary the whole surface with G inches of Portland cement concrete Properly relay floors, and provide air-bricks to the spaces below the floors. Ventilation of Dwelling Rooms.-Cut openings in the ceilings and roofs of upper rooms, and provide dormer windows capable of opening Cut openings in the walls and fix Tobin fresh-air inlets. Water Supply.—Provide stoneware sinks in each ground floor room, with trapped lead sink waste from each, to discharge into gullies in the open. Supply draw tap and connections from the main to each house. Drains.—Reconstruct the drainage, disconnecting from the sewer, and providing adequate ventilation. Provide a separate w.c. for each tenement. Thoroughly cleanse the walls and ceilings of the rooms of all the tenements Repair paving where necessary, and limewash the walls of court where necessary. In executing the above works it was necessary to demolish one of the cottages. This provided more air space about the remaining cottages. The proposals were accepted, as likely to remove the insanitary conditions complained of, and render the dwellings fit 137 for occupation. The works were completed, and the cottages re-occupied in the month of July, 1905. PETITION FROM SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY. On petition from the Social Democratic Party presented to the Borough Council on 7th instant, as follows:— "We, the undersigned, call upon the Hackney Borough Council to undertake immediately a house-to-house inspection, by Sanitary Inspectors, of dwelling houses in the Borough, particularly in those districts occupied by the working class; and further call upon the Borough Council to use its present powers of compelling the landlords to keep all houses in good repair." After some discussion, resolved: That it be referred to the Medical Officer of Health to prepare a full report upon the matter according to the views of the Public Health Committee, and submit same to the Borough Council at its next meeting The Committee to meet at 6.15 p.m., on Thursday, 21st October, 1909, to consider the report. Report to Council. The following report was read and signed, and ordered to be presented to the Council that evening:— To the Hackney Borough Council. Sec. A.—On petition from the Social Democratic Party presented to the Borough Council on 7th instant, as follows:— "We, the undersigned, call upon the Hackney Borough Council to undertake immediately a house to house inspection, by Sanitary Inspectors, of dwelling houses in the Borough, particularly in those districts occupied by the 138 working class; and further call upon the Borough Council to use its present powers for compelling landlords to keep all houses in good repair." We have carefully considered the petition presented to the Council by the Social Democratic Party on the 7th October, and beg herewith to report thereon. We wish, in the first instance, to recall to the Council's recollection the circumstances under which the petition was signed. It appears that in order to obtain signatures two circulars were drafted, one for the man in the street, and another, somewhat more ambitious in character, professing to give certain reasons why a house-to-house inspection should be undertaken by the Borough Council. In both circulars it was stated that 2,003 complaints were received at the Town Hall which were not discovered by the Inspectors, but were complained of by private persons. In the Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1908, from which the above statement is said to be taken, there is the following (page 42):— "Complaints of Nuisance.—During the year 1908 there were 2,003 complaints of nuisance made to the Public Health Department and investigated by the Sanitary Inspectors of the Borough. A considerable number, about 13 per cent., were, anonymous, but these received the same consideration as other complaints. Notices were served, for the abatement of any nuisances found, on the person or persons liable under the above Act to abate the nuisances." It will be seen from this quotation that there is no justification for the statement that the complaints referred to were made by private persons and not discovered by the Sanitary Inspectors. As a matter of fact, an analysis of the source of these complaints, gives the following:— 139 Received from persons occupying premises complained of 290 Received either from persons who give no address or no name and address 295 The remainder comprise:— 1. Complaints from persons at other addresses. 2. Inspectors' notices of defects found by them during supervision of work at other premises. 3. Complaints received from Relieving Officers, Mansion House Council, Jewish Board, Medical Men, etc. 4. Notices from Metropolitan Water Board of water cut off. 5. On reference from other departments and plaints handed in by the Medical Officer of Health. 6. Inspections of newly-erected dwellings for the issue of water certificates. Again, in the circular dated 16th September, 1909, emanating from the Central and South Hackney Social Party, after drawing attention to the results of certain house-to-house inspections which were made in the London Fields District and in the Homerton District during 1908, the author makes the following statement:— "The full effect of these unwholesome surroundings on the individual and the community cannot be entirely stated, but some indication is given by a comparison of the rate of the infantile mortality in the Upper Clapton District compared with Hackney Wick and Homerton. On page 19 of the Medical Officer's Report the population of Stamford Hill and Upper Clapton is stated to be 51,706. The deaths under one year were 116. In the Hackney Wick and 140 Homerton District the population is 59,612, and the deaths under one year were 304. These are the average rates for the ten years 1898-1907." The intention of this comparison of districts is to spread abroad the view (entirely erroneous) that the infant mortality rate in the poor districts is nearly three times that in the higher class districts. Any doubt which might be raised as to this being the intended view, is set at rest by the following unqualified statement, which appeared in the Social Democratic Party's organ, 2nd October, 1909:—"For every child who dies under the age of twelve months in Upper Clapton nearly three children die in Homerton and Hackney Wick." This is a most unwarranted statement. The fact is, on comparing the infant mortality of the two districts that where one infant under twelve months of age dies in Stamford Hill 1.67 die in Homerton and Hackney Wick. This is altogether different to the statement of one to nearly three, above quoted. It cannot be doubted that the above mis-statements obtained a large number of the signatures appended to the petition. We would like here to point out that if the figures quoted from the Report of the Medical Officer of Health had been seriously studied, it would have been seen that the infantile death rate had fallen 14 per 1,000 births in Stamford Hill during the ten years quoted, as against a fall of 26 per 1,000 births in Homerton and Hackney Wick. If infant mortality is to be regarded as reduceable by inspections, this would indicate really much more attention had been given in this respect to the poorer district than to the richer district; but it is well known, and it has been explained in the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health quoted by the petitioners that the high infant mortality is chiefly dependent upon the three factors, want of knowledge in the proper principles of infant feeding, carelessness and poverty. 141 Do the petitioners seriously believe that a house-to-house inspection in the poorer parts of the Borough will remove or partially remove either of these factors? We can confidently answer in the negative; for the spokesman who presented the petition to the Borough Council on 7th October, without giving any reasons for the proposed house-to-house inspection, except that certain clergymen residing in the Borough had signed the petition, candidly admitted that the real object was to obtain work for the unemployed. It would almost appear from the recurring agitation for house-to-house inspections that there are certain people who regard such inspection as a panacea for all the woes of the poorer classes. As the petitioners appear not to be aware of the work of the Public Health Department in this matter of house-to-house inspection, your Committee think this opportunity should not be passed by to enlighten them. From the petition it might be assumed that the Public Health Committee have never sanctioned house-to-house inspection in the working class districts of the Borough; but the truth is that in the year 1904 the Council recognised the necessity for such inspections, and appointed two Inspectors to give their whole time to this work. These have now been at work in the Borough over five years, and have given their time and energies exclusively to house to house inspections in the working class districts of the Borough. Moreover the High Hill Ferry district was made small in order to enable the Inspector to accomplish a yearly inspection of the smaller class property in that area, in addition to his other duties. He has been able to accomplish this. Similarly, the district of Hackney Wick was given alone to one Inspector, with the like object. Further, in the intervals of their other duties, the District Inspectors, of whom we have twelve, make house-to-house inspections. 142 We would also point out that the Borough of Hackney stands alone of all the Metropolitan Boroughs in having two inspectors devoted solely to house-to-house inspections; and in only two other Metropolitan Boroughs has one such officer been appointed. The following gives the number of house-to-house inspections made in the Borough during the five years referred to:— 1904 571 1905 954 1906 1,325 1907 1,043 1908 1,554 and it will be found that during the current year the figures of 1908 will be exceeded. These inspections are made, it must be remembered, in the working class districts of the Borough. From a consideration of the whole of these facts, your Committee are of opinion that the petitioners have been grossly misled as to the attention given to the sanitary requirements of the working class districts, and as to the necessity for an extension of the house-to-house inspections in the Borough, and We Recommend— That no action be taken with respect to the petition, and that the reference to your Committee thereon be discharged. 143 REPORT OF CANAL BOATS INSPECTOR.
