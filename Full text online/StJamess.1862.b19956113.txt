To the Chairman and Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, 25th June, 1863. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, At the expiration of another twelvemonth I have the honor to present a short Statement of the principal Works that have been executed in my department. They do not apparently form a very long list, but that is owing principally to the extreme care evinced by the Committee of Works in not sanctioning the execution of any Works that were not clearly necessary. The Paving Works have been almost exclusively confined to repairs, of which a great number have been executed, in addition to making the Roadways safe after the incessant disturbances by the Gas and Water Companies, and other causes. This last item alone is almost sufficient work for the Vestry to undertake and properly execute, as my Fortnightly Returns will show. The few Special Works executed in the Paving Department were considered as necessary Works by the Committee, after mature deliberation. xii The comparatively satisfactory condition of the various sewers in the parish generally has obviated the necessity for any specially New Works. The principal Works that have been executed have consisted of cleansing those we have, as accumulations of various substances will occasionally occur in the small sewers to which we have no access, such as those in front of the houses in Regent Street. This matter is under consideration, and probably before the next twelvemonth has expired the Yestry will be in possession of sufficient information to guide them as to the advisability of making the necessary outlay to prevent the recurrence of these stoppages, or to decide as to whether the present arrangements are the best. An attempt is also being made to produce a satisfactory scheme for reducing the number of the gullies in Regent Street—with what success remains to be seen. It will probably resolve itself into a question of Finance. The question of Public Conveniences has occupied, and still does occupy, the attention of the Works Committee and the Vestry; but the question of convenient sites still appears to be insurmountable. One at the Pall Mall end of King's Place has been removed, and I feel bound to state that in my opinion there are only two courses open to the Vestry: one is to purchase or rent the back premises of some of the houses in the leading thoroughfares for the purpose; or to conceal them by sinking them below the surface of the Roadways. It is true that the xiii most natural and inexpensive position is on the surface, but the traffic of the leading thoroughfares in St. James's Parish being so great and incessant, I doubt if room can or ought to be spared for the purpose, and if they are not in the leading thoroughfares they are comparatively useless. This is a subject that cannot receive too much consideration from the Vestry or its Officers, and I think no expense or pains should be spared by them while the power to construct them is exclusively their own, and it appears to me the best way to ensure that power remaining their own is to exercise it judiciously. I have a most satisfactory duty to perform in reporting the completion of the Vestry Hall and Offices, and that the whole of the work gives undoubted evidence of being executed in the best manner. No settlements or defects, such as are sometimes unavoidable, have appeared, and from the time that has elapsed since its completion, I do not anticipate we shall find any now. The Vestry have cause to congratulate themselves on the manner this building has been carried on and completed. An attempt to enumerate the whole of the works, small and great, executed in the department with which I have the honor to be connected would fill a moderately-sized volume, but reference to the minutes of proceedings of the Works Superintendence Committee would not only shew what has xiv been done, but the reasons that guided the Committee in arriving at their Resolutions, and would also show the time and labour expended by the Committee in as far as possible sifting the merits of any matter brought under their notice. I have the honor to be, Rev. Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, Yours most obediently, A. P. HOWELL.

JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, FOR THE YEAR 1862, BY EDWIN LANKESTER, M.D. F.R.S. F.L.S. member of the royal college of physicians; medical officer of health and public analyst for st. james's, westminster. A TO THE VESTRY OF The Parish of St. James's Westminister. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you my Seventh Annual Report on the Causes of Death and the Sanitary Work executed in your Parish during the year 1862. The results are given in Tables at the end of this Report, and I now proceed to draw your attention in detail to some of the subjects which have occupied my attention during that year, and with which you have been more or less informed by my Fortnightly Reports. Before proceeding to special subjects I would speak first of the general mortality of the year 1862. MORTALITY OF 1862. The total number of deaths in the four quarters is 727. This is slightly in excess of the average of the last seven years, which is 718; but it is below the mortality of last year, and must be regarded as representing on the whole a favourable state of the health of the Parish. In order that you may see how the deaths of the year contrasts with those of previous years I present you with the number of deaths in each year since 1855, when sanitary measures were first carried out in the Parish:- 4 1856 682 1857 712 1858 669 1859 764 1860 723 1861 758 1862 727 I shall not on the present occasion make any comments upon the very unequal manner in which this death presses upon the different districts of the Parish, but satisfy myself with giving the deathrate of the different districts of the Parish for the last and preceding five years:— Population. Deaths in 1862. 1861. 1860. 1859. 1858. 1857. St. James's Square Division, 10,753 123 148 129 149 139 148 Golden Square Division, 13,963 267 245 247 262 182 232 Berwick Street Division, 10,068 218 250 236 249 219 219 Workhouse, .. 135 114 112 109 127 114 There are one or two points in this Table worthy of remark, and. the first is that the mortality of the Berwick Street Division has never been so low any year of the six years as last year. The full value of this statement can only he understood when it is recollected that the Berwick Street Division of the Parish is that which is most overcrowded, contains 5 the poorest population, and is most amenable to, and has been most acted upon by sanitary measures. In the next place I would point out the high rate of mortality in the Workhouse during the past year, as compared with any previous year. I have not had an opportunity of comparing the ages and diseases at which persons have died in the Workhouse, but I can find no one cause to which I can attribute the increased mortality of the Workhouse. It will also be observed that the death in the St. James's Square Division was less than in any of the previous years since 1857, whilst the death of the Golden Square Division is greater than in any previous year of the six recorded in the Table. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. I now turn to the Tables for information with regard to the various kinds of disease which afflict the Parish. I have always regarded the group of Zymotic Diseases as of most interest, because it is these diseases which seem to be most under the control of sanitary measures, and are most obviously amenable to human agency. At the same time it is most humiliating to find that it is this very class of diseases that the great bulk of the people regard as the necessary concomitants of their existence, and take the least care to prevent. Yet it is the most demonstrable of vital facts that populations can be kept from the attacks of these diseases. 6 There are countries in the world where small pox, scarlet fever, measles, and other Zymotic Diseases have never been known to occur; and just as we have exterminated plague I believe it possible with ordinary foresight and care on the part of the community to exterminate the group of plagues which annually carry off a fourth of those who die in the great cities of the world. In order that you may see exactly the mortality from these Zymotic Diseases in your Parish, I reproduce here the tables which I have published for the last eight years, that you may see the numbers who have died, the nature of the disease, and the districts in which death have occurred. 1855.

Whilst in 1861 hooping cough claimed the greatest number of victims, in 1862 scarlatina carried off the largest number. In no one year has any of these forms of contagious diseases been fatal to so many as scarlet fever was last year. Of the 66 cases, 29 occurred in the Berwick Street division, thus clearly pointing to the fact that where the population is thickest there this disease is most deadly in its effects. I pointed out in my last Annual Report the fact that this disease 9 is transmitted from family to family by the careless manner in which the members of infected families mingle with those who are not infected. This disease is constantly to be traced to schools where children arc received from infected families, thus spreading the disease in every direction. SMALL POX. Although there was but one fatal case of this disease in the year 1862, I have not ceased in my Reports to impress the fact that vaccination is the only efficient means of preventing the spread of this disease. I believe that if every child born was efficiently vaccinated, that small pox would be entirely annihilated. We have no instance where small pox has been originated, tie novo, in a human being who has been vaccinated. It was on this account that 011 the 5tli of February, 1862, I recommended to the Vestry a plan which is embraced in the following extract from my Report of that date:—"With regard to the subject of "Vaccination I stated in my last Report, that it "did not appear that a large number of persons "had complied with the provisions of the "Vaccination Extension Act. By the provisions "of an Act passed last year, every Board of "Guardians has power given them 'to appoint "'some person to institute and conduct proceedings 10 "'for the purpose of enforcing obedience ' to the "Act with regard to vaccination. Whether you "would choose to act upon this power or not, "I think that much good might be done by "making inquiry of the parents of all children "whether their children have been vaccinated or "not. This would require some organization; "such as a Return of all Children born every "quarter, and a distinct Registry kept of those "who had been ascertained to have been vaccinated. "Such an organization would incur considerable "labour; and it is for you, in conjunction with "the Board of Guardians, to consider whether "such a duty might not be successfully performed "in conjunction with the department of the "Medical Officer of Health." This Report having been submitted to the Sanitary Committee, the following suggestions were recommended to the Vestry for adoption:— "First,—That a Vaccination Book be kept "in which all births in the Parish "be entered by the Registrars in "such a manner as to enable the "Medical Officer of Health to indicate "when the children have been vacci" natcd. "Second,—That the Public Vaccinators be also "requested to furnish returns of all "children vaccinated, for registration 11 "in the Medical Officer of Health's "Vaccination Book. "Third,—That in all cases where no return is "made of the performance of vaccina"tion, that the Sanitary Inspector shall "call and ascertain whether such child " has been vaccinated. "Fourth,—That the result of such inquiries be "registered in the Vaccination Book, "and reported to the Board of Guar"dians once in every month. "Fifth,—That the Vestry be requested to sanction "the payment of the usual fees to the "Registrars and Vaccinators." These recommendations were not carried into effect at this time. Nor can I say if they had been they would have been effectual for the prevention of small-pox. When a parish is so surrounded by other parishes as that of St. James's, Westminster, it is almost impossible to secure immunity from contagious diseases, unless the surrounding parishes adopt equally effective measures for the repression of these diseases. Since the spread of the present epidemic of small-pox (1863) I have been much * impressed with the necessity of combined parochial action. The necessity of this has been especially shewn in the want of accommodation for the separation of persons attacked with small-pox from their families. Although each parish has done what 12 it could, these efforts have been so imperfect and of so little effect that London has on this occasion suffered from one of the greatest attacks of smallpox that has been known since the days of Jenner. It is really no excuse to say it could not be helped, and that everything had been done to prevent it. If proper precaution had been taken it could have been helped, and the very things that would have prevented it were not done. The fault does not lie at your door alone, but it does lie at the door of the public somewhere, and the public ought to know it, and prevent such a dreadful calamity in future. TYPHUS AND TYPHOID FEVERS. Under the head of typhus in the above tables I have included typhoid fever. The fact is, typhoid is as distinct a disease from typhus fever as scarlet fever is from measles. Typhus is a highly contagious disease and has its origin in contagion, and is maintained and propagated in overcrowded populations. It is a disease that delights in human dirt, as flies do in putrid meat. It is one of the creditable things in our overcrowded parish that we have so little typhus. The other disease, typhoid, or gastric fever, is not so contagious as typhus, and seems to originate in decomposing animal and vegetable matter, so much so that it has been called " drain fever." This fever has prevailed very much both in 13 this country and on the Continent of Europe for the last two or three years. It visits the rich equally with the poor, and no class of the community is exempt from its attacks. The poisons which generate it steal from the imperfect drain or neighbouring cesspool, and finds access into the second floor sleeping rooms of the rich, as into the cellars and attics of the poor. It counts up its victims amongst the noble and the powerful of the land, and Portugal has to lament the death of two of its sovereigns, Italy, that of its most distinguished statesman, and England, the wise and good husband of her sovereign, as victims of this cruel disease. Yet these terrible losses point but in one direction as to their source, and that is ignorance and neglect. Where privies and cesspools are left unemptied, where water closets are without water, where drains are imperfect, where sewers are unswept, where slaughter houses and cow houses are allowed to accumulate their filth, where dust-bins reek with unconsumed animal and vegetable matter, and dust carts are allowed to throw out their foul effluvia in our streets in midday, there this disease must exist and carry off its victims. Of the cases enumerated under the head of typhus in the above Tables, the majority have been cases of typhoid fever. In some instances the causes of this disease have been traced to defects of drainage or some impurity in the house where it has occurred, but in a large number of cases the disease seems to have been contracted at a distance 14 from homo. It needs but a single whiff of this poison to produce the disease in those who are predisposed to its attacks. DIARRHŒA. The Table of zymotic disease presents us with a slight increase of diarrhœa in 1802, over the two O preceding years; but taking the eight years, there have been 48 deaths from diarrhoea in the last four years, against 69 for the four preceding. This would seem to indicate that some of the sources of diarrhoea have been removed. There can be no doubt that one of the great causes of diarrhoea is the introduction into the system of decomposing animal and vegetable matter, and that this decomposition comes on most speedily in hot weather. It is thus that in hot seasons we have most diarrhoea. But much may be done, even in the hottest seasons, to prevent the spread of this disease, by removing accumulations of tilth, and more especially by taking care that the water drunk is free from impurities. With regard to the water supply, I have constantly directed my attention to the state of the water in cisterns. Unless cisterns are cleansed out every two or three months, tlicy are liable to accumulations of vegetable matter at the bottom which in the summer suddenly decompose, and the water is then in a state which will produce diarrhoea in those who drink it. I 15 have recently ascertained that water cisterns near water closets, and supplying water closets, are very liable to absorb and become contaminated with the gases from the use of the water closet. Such water is most objectionable for drinking purposes, and too much care cannot be taken to prevent the contamination of which I speak. I have reported to you from time to time on the state of the wells of the parish. With the exception of that in Piccadilly, they are all unfit for drinking purposes—not so much on account of their immediate danger, but that they are liable to contamination from the sewers and drains, and contain at all times a large proportion of organic matter from the soakage of the soil. My own experiments on this subject have been confirmed by Dr. R. D. Thomson, Dr. Letheby, and other Medical Officers of Health in London, and, with the exception of our own Parish, these surface well pumps have been nearly all closed throughout London. There is less necessity than ever for offering the public the filtered sewage of these pumps, now that there exists so large a number of public fountains, the water of which passes through properly constructed filters, and is free from any objection. I would also here remind you that, by the provisions of the amended Metropolitan Management Act, Vestries have the power of erecting public fountains, and maintaining them in order, out of the Parish rates. There are many sites in St. James's adapted for public fountains 16 not yet occupied, and few greater services could be done to the community than erecting on these spots elegant drinking fountains. CONSUMPTION. The most fatal of human diseases in civilised countries is consumption. It carries off annually a seventh part of those who die in this parish. It is a disease of the lungs which when once it commences is seldom arrested. There is no better established fact in the history of the causes of disease than that Phthisis is produced from want of fresh air. It is only one of many forms of disease known to medical men by the name of scrofula, that are brought on from the same cause. It occurs amongst the rich as well as the poor, and is everywhere attributable to the want of fresh air. The rich as well as the poor, the middle and the working classes, are all liable to this disease. It is popularly attributed to cold, hence the very efforts that are made to keep it off are those which produce it. That cold does not produce it is shewn by the fact that those who are most exposed to cold by their occupations suffer least from it. The sailor, the butcher, the labourer, those who work in the open air are least exposed to it, whilst the shopkeeper, the milliner, the tailor, and those engaged in sedentary occupations are most liable to it. There is no 17 question connected with public health that has made so little progress as the importance and necessity of ventilation in order to admit of the access of fresh air. The rich live and sleep in rooms which are seldom efficiently ventilated. They give parties, attend theatres, worship in churches, and live in rooms all badly ventilated. The shops, the workrooms, the warehouses, the schools of the middle and lower classes are all badly ventilated. The homes of the poor are worse than all. No construction of rooms and houses will ensure ventilation. It requires constant intelligent attention, and until all classes are better instructed this dreadful disease will invade our homes and make desolate our hearths. Added to the fact of deficient ventilation the introduction of gas is almost universal. One gas burner consumes the air of five persons and no provision is made for carrying off the products of this combustion. The following tables of the cases of consumption in your parish for the last five years, will shew you how constant has been the death from this disease. 1857. Population. Deaths from Phthisis. 1857. 1858. 1859. 1860. 1861. 1862. St. James's Square Division, 10,753 19 16 15 15 19 15 Golden Square Division 13,963 25 21 31 35 35 26 Berwick Street Division, 10,068 16 31 32 32 26 41 Workhouse, .. 27 31 23 30 17 31 Total, .. 87 99 101 112 97 113 B 18 These Tables shew that in whatever diseases a diminution has taken place it has not occurred in consumption. At the same time it shews that the occurrence of consumption is in proportion to the density of the population. Thus, whilst the average of death in the St. James's Square District is 18 in the 100, it is 28 in the Golden Square, and 29 in the Berwick Street. This gives on an average one death from consumption in every 594 of the population in the St. James's Square District, one in every 500 in the Golden Square District, and one in every 370 in the Berwick Street District. It should be recollected, however, that a large number of persons who contract phthisis in our Parish do not die here. Young men and women come up from the country, and live two or three years in our large shops and workrooms, and contracting phthisis go back again into the country to die, or they are admitted into hospital, workhouses, and other institutions. I have omitted, in the above calculations, the deaths which occur in the workhouse, and which are very considerable. The cases of consumption there are probably drawn principally from the Berwick Street District, but even supposing that only one third of the workhouse cases are drawn from that district, it would give one death from consumption annually in every 280 of the population. When we recollect that the average death from consumption in all London is one in 371 of the population, it will be seen that the great scourge of our population is 19 sumption. Taking our whole population, the death from consumption is one in every 344 of the population, which is a very considerably larger proportion than in all London. Looking at these figures then, and seeing that for the last six years there has been a tendency to increase in this disease, it undoubtedly is one of the first and most earnest questions to which attention ought to be devoted, as to how its progress can be arrested. The diminution of the overcrowding, and the improvement of the ventilation of houses, shops, and work-rooms, are evidently the two great objects to which all exertions should be directed. Whilst these two great objects are kept in view, it is manifest that there are various secondary methods of action which may be adopted with success. It is not only necessary that too large a number of persons should not be crowded together, and that the places in which they live should be properly supplied with fresh air, but facilities should be given to persons engaged in sedentary employments to obtain fresh air out of doors. I have often before alluded to the importance of the parks in the neighbourhood of St. James's being made not only accessible to the inhabitants of this parish, but of their being so arranged as to offer inducements for the people to walk in them and spend their time there. I think two things might be done which have hitherto been neglected. In the first place, I think, open spaces ought to be railed off where cricket 20 and other sports may be pursued by the populace. I think such games and sports should be encouraged by all classes of the community, and clubs should be formed amongst the various classes of sedentary workers for the practice and encouragement of these games. I think that in this way the practice of soldiering by young men as volunteers, has done some service. In the next place, I think cheap refreshments should be sold in the parks. I would not advise that beer and vane be sold, but coffee, tea, chocolate, and fruit might be sold at stalls, which would tend to draw all classes from the close and confined public houses, which are as destructive to health from the universally close and impure condition of the atmosphere of their rooms, as they are from the poisonous nature of the compounds which are sold in them. SPECIAL NUISANCES. During the year several nuisances have occupied my attention, and to the principal of these I now refer. Cow-Houses. Of all the injurious practices that have grown up with our large populations, there is none more so than that of keeping cows for the purpose of supplying milk as an article of diet. The milk of the cow, when furnished by the healthy animal, 21 surrounded by circumstances conducive to its health, is one of the most valuable articles of diet, and is especially useful as a part of the diet of children. In consequence of the universal demand for this food, the practice of keeping cows in large towns has grown up. The nuisances arising from this practice are, that the cows are kept in close and confined situations, where their excretions become a source of disease and annoyance to those around where they live, and the milk of the creatures thus kept is liable to changes which render it injurious to those who partake of it. Several times during the past year, I was compelled to notice the existence of disease in the neighbourhood of the cow-houses in the Parish. In the houses contiguous to the cow-house in New Street diphtheria prevailed ; a whole family was attacked, and two children speedily died. On two occasions I have presented memorials from the inhabitants of Marshall Street praying for the removal of the cow-house in that street. Such is the nuisance created in various parts of the Parish by the existence of cow-houses, that now that people better understand the danger of living near them, the value of property has greatly deteriorated in their neighbourhood. The Legislature has been fully alive to the danger of such places, and in the Amended Metropolitan Act of 1862, will be found the following section:— 22 "From and after the first day of November, "one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, no "place within any parish or place mentioned in "the schedules to the firstly-recited Act shall be "used by any person carrying on the business of a "slaughterer of cattle or cowkeeper or dairyman as "a slaughter-house for the purpose of slaughtering "cattle or a cow-house or place for the keeping of "cows, without a licence had for such purpose "respectively from the Justices of the Peace "assembled at a Special Sessions held in the "division or district where such slaughter-house, "cow-house, or place is situate, and such licence "shall continue in force for the period of one year "from the granting thereof, and thenceforth until "the Special Sessions to be held next after the "expiration of such period, and no fee or reward "exceeding five shillings shall be taken for any "such licence ; and if any person carrying on such "business of a slaughterer of cattle, cowkeeper, or "dairyman use as a slaughter-house or cow-house ''any place within any parish or place mentioned in "the schedules of the firstly-recited Act which is "not so licensed, every person so offending shall "for each offence be liable to a penalty not "exceeding five pounds, of which offence the fact "that cattle have been taken into such place shall "be deemed sufficient prima facie evidence: "Provided always, that before any licence for the "use of any place as a slaughter-house or cow-house 23 "is granted as aforesaid, fourteen days' notice of "the intention to apply for such licence shall be "given to the Vestry or District Board of the "parish or district in which any such place is "situate, to the intent that such Vestry or District "Board, if they think fit, may show cause against "the granting of any such licence, and also seven "days' notice previous to such Special Sessions "being held of the intention to apply for such "licence shall be given to the Clerk of the Justices "for such division: Provided, that nothing in this "Act contained shall extend to slaughter-houses "erected or to be erected in the Metropolitan "Cattle Market under the authority of the "Metropolitan Market Act, 1851, or the Metropo"litan Market Act, 1857." From this provision you will see that cow-houses are now licensed as slaughter-houses. From my conviction of the danger to health and the deterioration of the value of property in the neighbourhood of cow-houses, I had no hesitation in recommending the Vestry to use their influence with the magistrates to prevent the licensing of these houses altogether. The Sanitary Committee recommended the Vestry that they should adopt this course. The magistrates however, unwilling to interfere at once with so large a property, granted licences to the cowkeepers of the Parish, under the following regulations:— 24 "1. Every cow-house shall be properly paved "with some non-absorbent material, set and bedded "in cement to the satisfaction of the Vestry, with "a proper inclination to the foot of the stalls, so as "to flow into a channel leading by a fall of not less "than 1£ inches in 10 feet to a trapped gully. "2. Every cow-house shall be provided with "a proper trapped drain, to convey fluid matter "alone into the sewers. "3. Every cow-house shall be furnished with "an adequate supply of water, and be thoroughly "washed at least once a day. "4. All solid manure and refuse shall be "carefully swept up at least twice a day, and be "removed at least three times a week. "5. Every cow-house shall be kept in proper "condition, and the walls be limewashed at least "four times a year, within 14 days of each quarter "day. "6. Every cow-house shall have a space of at "least 8 feet by 4 feet for a single cow, or a space "at least 8 feet by 7 feet for two cows (when "kept in pairs); each cow to have a breathing "space of at least 1000 cubic feet; the cow-house "to be properly lighted and ventilated; and in all "cases where there are inhabited rooms above "cow-houses, or when the sanitary state of the "neighbourhood requires it, to be provided with "tight roofs and ventilating shafts, so as to convey 25 "the noxious exhalations above the level of the "adjacent houses. "7. Every cow-yard in which a cow-house is "situated shall be well paved with stone, or other "impervious material (the joints of the paving to "be run with grout), with such a slope towards "the channels and trapped gulley, as to permit the "rapid escape of all fluids into the sewer, and "shall be washed at least once daily. "8. The grains bins, and wash receptacles, "shall be kept properly cleansed and under cover. "9. The Medical Officer of Health and "Sanitary Inspector shall be permitted to enter "every cow-house at all seasonable times daily. "10. That the Justices in Special Sessions "be recommended not to renew any licence, where "the foregoing rules are not strictly complied "with." Slaughter Houses. These are nuisances of a less serious kind than cow-houses. The refuse of dead animals is more easily dealt with and removed than that of living ones. The law requires that they should be licensed, and they are subject to the same general conditions as cow-houses. In this parish a system of converting private dwelling-houses into slaughter houses, wherever butchers' shops existed, had been allowed to grow up. The magistrates have gradually reduced the number of these slaughter houses—first, 26 by refusing all licences for slaughtering under ground; and second, by refusing new licences for slaughtering in private houses at all. In this way I hope we shall gradually see the extinction of the objectionable practice of slaughtering animals for sale in private houses. Up to the time of the passing of the Amended Metropolitan Management Act, slaughtering was frequently carried on in unlicensed houses. The attempts at preventing this failed, from the difficulty of proving that the animals were killed on the premises. It is now sufficient to prove that live cattle were on the premises, to obtain a conviction of the offender. Public Urinals. I have frequently brought before you complaints made of the position and state of the public urinals in the Parish. That these erections are of great public utility there can be no doubt, and the necessity of them is recognised in all the great cities of Europe. In order, however, that they may not constitute nuisances, they should be erected in public situations and kept scrupulously clean, by a due supply of water. Many of the urinals in this parish are erected in positions which cause them to become nuisances to the neighbourhoods in which they exist, and frequent memorials have been presented to you for their removal. Objections have been also raised to these places when they have been erected in an unsightly 27 manner in the middle of our great thoroughfares. The least objectionable position in which urinals can be erected is underground, and I have suggested that this question should be taken up by the Metropolitan Board of Works, who, in carrying out the improvement of streets, have a great opportunity of improving the position of these places. Should the Board carry out the plan of making sub-ways in the streets of London this would be an opportunity of erecting underground urinals in all our great thoroughfares which I hope will not be lost sight of. SALE OF DISEASED MEAT. The extensive prevalence of disease amongst cattle, and the large seizures of diseased meat made under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, have called my attention to the condition of the butchers' meat sold in the Parish. I have visited the shops in the most crowded parts of the Parish, and have found no indications of anything like diseased meat offered for sale. I have had brought to me meat which had been supposed to be diseased, but on examination I have found it to be inferior meat, which had been kept too long. This has been more especially the case with pork. I reported to you on this subject on the 30th April, 1862, and I then stated that I thought meat ought to be seized which had been killed under the following circumstances:— 28 First,—The meat of animals slaughtered in a state of acute inflammatory diseases. Second,—The meat of animals that have wasted from lingering disease. Third,—The meat of animals that have died from causes other than the act of the butcher. In addition to these recommendations I stated, "I "have no hesitation in expressing my belief that "the sale of diseased meat is dangerous to the "health of the community, and if it be found "impracticable to prevent its sale I would compel "the butcher to label all such meat as 44 diseased," "and thus give the public the opportunity of "deciding the question." OVERCROWDING. By referring to the Report of the Sanitary Inspector you will find that I have given notice for the removal of several families from the close and confined rooms in which they have been found. By the provisions of the Metropolis Management Act, and the Nuisances Removal Act, cellars- and kitchens deficient in ventilation and space, are forbidden to be occupied by human beings. There is, however, no direction for the size and arrangements of lodging rooms above the ground. In the Nuisances Removal Act a definition is given of a nuisance, by which a 29 room considered injurious to health may be interfered with, but nothing is said with regard to any particular space. Cases have been brought before the Magistrates of London where their action has been sought, and in several cases it has been determined that families ought to have in sleeping rooms at least 800 cubic feet for each person, and in lodging rooms, or in rooms used as lodging and sleeping rooms, 500 cubic feet of space for each person. It is in cases where there is very much less space than this that I have directed notice of removal to be served. Under these notices upwards of 200 kitchens and lodging rooms have been emptied. It is, however, much to be feared that whilst the emptying goes on in one direction, overcrowding goes on in another, as I find from the Census that the diminution of the population altogether between 1851 and 1861 amounted, in the Golden Square District, to 176, and in the Berwick Street to 190, a very small diminution compared with the necessities of the population. It is most desirable that every opportunity should be taken of improving the dwellings of the working classes in this parish. The great majority of houses in which they live were built for single families, and the accommodation, where now four or five families are living, was originally intended for only one. The consequence of this system of living is that cleanliness, decency, and morality are in too many cases lost sight of, and a population, not of rate-payers, but rate- 30 consumers, is oncouragod. rTlio improvement of the dwellings of the poor in this parish would bo attended with immense economy, and the real way to savo the rates in this instance, as in so many others, is to spend them in the removal of the causes of pauperism, disease, and death. VENTILATION OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS. During the year I have visited most of the places of public resort for the purpose of ascertaining tlio condition of their ventilation. The dancing rooms in Groat Windmill Street, the Pavilion in Tichborno Street, and othor places of public resort of that kind are on the whole well-ventilated, and I found the proprietors ready to adopt any suggestion that could bo made for increasing the comfort and liealthfulness of these rooms. In most of them provision is made for gotting rid of the products of tlio combustion of the gas employed, and arrangements made for the admission of fresh air below. Many of the cliapels, churches, and school-rooms are deficient in the means of ventilation, and are constructed in such a way as to prevent an efficient discharge of bad air, and a full supply of fresh air. At tho same timo it is evident that as a conviction of the importance of this subject gains ground with those most interested in tho conduct of these places great improvements aro continually being made. 31 GAS. Having been appointed examiner of gas in the Parish, I have made it my duty to make investigations in all cases of complaint. I have found it however utterly impossible to judge of the correctness of these complaints, except by an examination of the gas at the Companies' works, and in my own house. I have several times examined the gas of the Chartered Gas Company, and also of the Western Gas Company at their works. I have gone at different times and seasons and have invariably found the gas of such quality as is required by Act of Parliament. As far also as my examination of the gas of the Western Company has gone at my own house it has been satisfactory. I would however by no means wish you to suppose for a moment that such examinations as I have made are at all satisfactory. What is really required is the fitting up of a properly arranged room where the gas may be introduced, and examined at any hour with regard to its pressure and lighting qualities. Till this is done, the office of gas examiner is a mere pretence, and the parish is deceived into the belief that they have a protection which is really nothing but a name. ADULTERATION OF FOOD. Under the Adulteration of Food Act, I was appointed, without salary, to the office of Food 32 Analyst, on the 13th of December, 18G0, an appointment that was confirmed by the Home Secretary, the late Sir George Cornewall Lewis, on the 28th of December, 1860. My appointment to this office has never yet been made public, and I have never had put at my disposal the means of carrying my appointment into effect. The analysis of food for the purpose of detecting adulteration demands extensive chemical apparatus and an efficient microscope. I possess the latter, and I have been enabled to make use, through the kindness of friends, of the former, in those parishes where the office of Food Analyst has not remained a dead letter. In this way I have been enabled to give opinions in the few cases that have come before me. I have no doubt, however, that if the Local Authority thought it desirable that people should not be cheated and poisoned by their food, that this office might be made most efficient, and that the publication of the names of only a few of the evil doers would have a most salutary effect upon the whole herd of those who strive to profit at the expense of their neighbours' pockets, health, or lives. METROPOLIS MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT ACT. Before concluding, I would remind you that the Act which called the Medical Officer of Health into existence, and which has given a new direction to 33 the action of parish organisation, has been amended during the past year. I have called your attention to the new powers which it gives you in the management of slaughter houses and cow-houses, and in the erection of public fountains. It also gives you power to supply houses with water which are deficient in the supply of this necessary article of daily use. It also gives you power to improve streets, a power which, for the sake of your overcrowded and afflicted population, you ought not to hesitate to make use of. It also gives you the power of paving and of draining courts and allies, and thus removes from out of your way the difficulties which have hitherto obstructed some of the most desirable improvements in the parish. Under this great sanitary Act the improvement of the health and the diminution of the mortality of London is surely, though slowly, proceeding. It has called into existence the gigantic system of sewerage, by which the whole of London will be relieved of those pestiferous exhalations which have formed the hot-bed of fever, cholera, and other destructive diseases. It is educating a body of men in parochial management, who are aiming at the advancement of their fellow-citizens in intelligence and morality, by removing from amongst them those causes of disease and death which are the fertile sources of poverty and crime. I commend to you the study of this Act, as one which in its spirit and aim has for its object the maintenance of the health and life of the community, through the c 34 operation of those Municipal Institutions of our land, which are alike the foundations of our political and social welfare. I am, Rev. Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, Your most devoted Servant, EDWIN LANKESTER. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, 25th June, 1863. APPENDIX containing page 1. Tables of Causes of Death, 30 2.
