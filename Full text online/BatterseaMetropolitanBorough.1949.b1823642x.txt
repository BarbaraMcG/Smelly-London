Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I present herewith my report upon the Health and Sanitary conditions of the Borough during the year 1949. Vital Statistics. The Registrar-General's estimate of the population in mid-year 1949 was 117,510, an increase of 1,010 over the estimate for the previous year. The birth rate was lower and the death rate showed a slight increase. The infantile mortality rate fell to 25.21 which is a record low rate for the Borough and compares with a rate of 29 for the County of London and 32 for England and Wales. The death rate of illegitimate children during 1949 was 22.73 per 1,000 illegitimate live births which is also a record low rate. Infectious Disease. The health of the inhabitants of the Borough was maintained at a satisfactory standard. Apart from an outbreak of Poliomyelitis of similar magnitude to that which occurred in 1947, there was no serious outbreak of infectious disease. There were only 5 confirmed cases of Diphtheria and no deaths from this disease during the year. This compares with 217 notifications and 7 deaths in 1938. There were 194 cases of Tuberculosis (all forms) notified, a decrease of 19 on the previous year and the deaths from this disease numbered 54, giving a death rate of 46.0 per 100,000 population. The number of notifications in 1938 was 194 and the death rate 71.3 per 100,000 population. The incidence of Scabies has decreased considerably, there being 51 notifications as compared to an average of 481 over the five year period 1944-48. Twenty-eight confirmed cases of Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis were notified during 1949, and 2 cases of Acute Polio-Encephalitis. Of the total 30 cases, 28 were children under the age of 15 years. There were 3 deaths. Of the 27 cases discharged from hospital, 3 were seriously paralysed, 8 had slight paralysis and the remaining 16 showed no evidence of paralysis. The deaths from Cancer continue to rise and numbered 37 more than in the previous year. These deaths constitute 18.9 per cent. of the total Battersea deaths during the year. Food Hygiene. There was no serious outbreak of food poisoning during the year. The increase in community feeding during the war years and since the end of the war has emphasised the importance of the careful and hygienic storage, handling and preparation of food. The common practice of cooking meat and serving it re-heated the following day, besides destroying its palatability and possibly its food value, is a potential source of danger of infection. Further, the holding over for sale from one day to the next, or even later, of such articles of food as meat pies, sausage rolls, etc., especially in warm weather, is fraught with danger and must be condemned. Many firms of repute have issued instructions that under no circumstances is any stock of this nature to be carried forward even overnight. It is, of course, highly desirable that premises where food is stored, handled and pre- 5 Pared, should at all times be kept in a cleanly condition and should be suitable for the purposes for which they are used, but there is doubt the greatest danger of infection is likely to arise from the persons handling the food. Much educational work is required to be done to educate employers and employees in this matter of food hygiene an in the grave consequences that may result if the elementary rules of hygiene and personal cleanliness are not observed. The Council, very much concerned with this problem, issued during the year a Code of Standards for Catering Establishments, a copy of which is appended to this report. Old People. The question of the care of aged and infirm people has become a matter of importance and concern during recent years due, in part, to the realisation of the fact that the proportion of old people in the Population is increasing and is likely to increase considerably in future years. The Battersea Old People's Welfare Committee, composed of representatives of the Council, of various voluntary organisations and of other interested persons throughout the Borough, has, for some time operated the " Meals on Wheels " service to provide hot mid-day meals to aged people who are either bed-ridden or are confined to their homes. The meals are obtained from the London County Council Restaurant. Latchmere Road, and are sold to the old people at a charge of 8d. During 1949, one van operated on this service and the cost of distribution was £200, towards which the Borough Council made a grant. of £150. During the current year, a further van has been added and the Council has agreed to make a further contribution of £150. This service has been much appreciated by the old people, and, part at least, supplies a very crying need. Housing. As in the previous year, much of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors was concerned with the investigation of complaints of sanitary defects in houses in the Borough and in the main action has been taken, where necessary, under the Public Health (London)Act, 1936. 2,933 houses were dealt with in this connection during the year. In appropriate cases, informal and formal action was taken under Section 9 of the Housing Act', 1936. Co-operation continued with the Council's housing Department in connection with recommendations for rehousing on medical grounds and in other ways. Many investigations are also made at the request of the London County Council where applicants for rehousing on their estates, allege that they are living in overcrowded or insanitary conditions I wish to thank the Mayor and Members of the Borough Council, and more particularly, the Chairmen and Members of Health and Housing Committees, for the continued encouragement and support which I have received from them during the year I gratefully acknowledge also the help I have received from the Chief Oficer of the Council and the assistance and loyal service always readily rendered by the whole of the staff of the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) G. MACDONALD, Medical Officer of Health. 6 Principal Figures for 1949.

The population of Battersea at the census taken in April, 1931, was 159,552, and the Registrar-General's estimate for 1949, therefore, indicates a decrease of 42,042 (or 26 per cent.) since the census, but an increase of 1,010 during 1948/9. The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year civilian population of the Borough (117,510) has been adopted for the purpose of the statistics contained in this Report. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered in the Borough during 1949 was 2,280 (1,258 male, 1,022 female). Of this number 1,089 were transferred out, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough, and 832 registered outside the Borough were transferred in, giving on balance a total of 2,023 births (1,070 male, 953 female, an excess of 117 males) relating to Battersea residents, and a live birth rate of 17.22 per 1,000 of the population. This is a decrease of 2.08 on that of 1948. Of the Battersea births (live and still) which occurred within the Borough, 792 were "domiciliary births." Illegitimate births numbered 132, or 6.5 per cent. of the live births. The number of births occurring in each quarter of the year is shown in the table on page 13. The live birth rate for the County of London was 18.5 per 1,000 of the civilian population, and for England and Wales the rate was 16.7 per 1,000 of the total population. Still-Births. The registration of still-births is made compulsory by the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1926. During 1949 there were 54 still-births registered in Battersea, of which 28 were of Battersea parents. 15 still-births occurring outside the Borough were registered as belonging to Battersea, making 43 in all, representing a still-birth rate of 20.81 per 1,000 births (live and still) registered. Of the 43 still-births 4 (9.3 per cent.) were registered as illegitimate. The number of Battersea still-births registered, and the still-birth rates from 1940 to 1949 were as under:— No. Rate No. Rate 1940 47 25.5 1946 59 22.7 1941 42 31.5 1947 74 27.0 1942 43 26.7 1948 46 20.1 1943 36 21.6 1949 43 20.8 1944 40 24.0 Mean 1945 38 23.3 1940-49 47 24.3 8 Notification of Births. During 1949 the number of notifications of live births received belonging to the Borough was 1,948. The corrected number of Battersea births registered during the year was 2,023. The proportion of notified to registered births was, therefore, 96.3 per cent. Forty-one still-births were notified under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, during the year, the number notified being 95.3 per cent. of the total Battersea still-births registered. The homes from which births are notified are visited and revisited bv Health Visitors. MARRIAGES. The marriages registered in Battersea during 1949 numbered 1,013. The marriage rate {i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 of the population) was 17.2. Year. Marriages.

The number of deaths registered in the Borough during 1949 was 1,844. Of these 955 were deaths of non-residents and were transferred to the districts in which the persons ordinarily resided. There were, on the other hand 537 deaths of Battersea residents registered outside the Borough. The total (corrected) number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 1,426 (males 725, females 701). This gives a recorded death rate of 12.14, compared with 12.2 for London, and an increase of 0.86 in 1948.

The corresponding death rate of legitimate children in 1949 was 25.38, the ratio of mortality rate of illegitimate infants to that of legitimate being 90 to 100. The corresponding figure for 1948 was 144 to 100. Maternal Mortality. During 1949 there were 2 deaths of women from diseases or accidents of child-birth, which is equivalent to a fatality rate of 0.97 per 1,000 births (live and still), as compared with 3 deaths and a fatality rate of 1.00 in 1948. The rate for England and Wales in 1949 was 0.98. Comparative Statistics of Births, Mortality, etc. (Compiled from Registrar-General's Returns.)

During the year 1949 there were 194 cases of Tuberculosis (all forms) notified in Battersea as compared with 213 in 1948, 162 in 1947, 228 in 1946, 199 in 1945, and 184 in 1944. In addition, 64 cases were reported or otherwise came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, making a total of 258 cases for the year. The case rate per 100,000 population was 219.6. The tables on page 18 give details in age groups of the 258 cases. Deaths from Tuberculosis. During 1949 deaths from Tuberculosis registered as belonging to the Borough of Battersea numbered 54, of which 48 (i.e., 88.9 per cent.) were due to pulmonary tuberculosis, 6 (i.e., 11.1 per cent) to other forms of the disease. The death rate per 100,000 of the population during the 49 years ended 1949 in quinquennial averages and in 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1949 are given in the following table:— Years Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total 1901-1905 138.1 50.9 189.0 1906-1910 126.8 45.9 172.7 1911-1915 124.2 33.8 158.0 1916-1920 134.8 30.0 164.8 1921-1925 92.6 23..0 115.6 1926-1930 91.1 14.2 105.3 1931-1935 81.8 14.4 96.2 1936-1940 76.1 9.2 85.3 1941-1945 91.8 11.0 102.8 Average (45 years) 106.2 25.8 132.0 1946 76.5 8.3 84.7 1947 51.3 9.6 60.9 1948 59.2 6.9 66.1 1949 40.9 5.1 46.0 The death rate per 100,000 population was 45 for England and Wales, and 52 for the County of London. 17 Tuberculosis, 1949.

During 1949 the number of deaths of Battersea residents from Cancer was 269 (males 150, females 119) as compared with 232 in 1948, 252 in 1947, 224 in 1946 and 214 in 1945. The death rate from the disease per 1,000 of the population was 2.29. The deaths from Cancer constitute 18.9 per cent. of the total Battersea deaths during the year.

During the year, legal proceedings were taken by the Council in 251 cases, for the enforcement of various Acts, by-laws, regulations, etc., administered by the Health Department. A summary is set out below,m and futher details will be found in the sections dealing with the respective matters. Public Health (London) Act. 1936 231 Food and Drugs Act, 1938 12 Public Health (Meat) Regulations. 1924 2 Housing Act, 1936 5 National Assistance Act, 1948 (Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons) 1 251 tunes totalling £10 10s. were imposed in connection with these proceedings, and £103 11s. costs were awarded to the Council. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions of this Act in regard to Nuisances continued to afford the main means whereby the remedy of insanitary conditions found in dwelling houses could be secured. During the year, 3,666 Intimation, and 2,178 Statutory (Nuisance ) Notices were served. The high proportion of Statutory to Intimation Notices gives some indication of the difficulty in securing compliance with the latter. Furthermore, legal proceedings to enforce compliance With Statutory Notices had to be taken in no less than 229 cases. Of these, 95 resulted in Nuisance Orders being made by the Court. Of the remaining 134 summonses, 132 were either adjourned or Withdrawn, as the work required to comply with the Notices was either in hand, or had been completed, before the hearing. In 2 cases fines totalling £2 were imposed. In 17 cases action to enforce compliance with Nuisance Orders had to be taken. In 16 of these, the Council carried out the work in default of the persons on whom the Orders were made. In those cases, the Council were entitled to recover the cost of the works from those persons, and accounts were accordingly rendered to them. Most of these accounts had been settled by the end of the year, but in 7 instances proceedings for the recovery of the cost had to be taken. Judgments for the amounts claimed were obtained in 2 cases, and in the remaining 5 cases the money was paid before the date of hearing of the summonses, which were then withdrawn. In the one remaining case, the Council elected to take proceedings for noncompliance with the Nuisance Order. The summons was adjourned sine die, the work having been carried out before the date of hearing. 22 Dustbins. Under Section 105 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, if any house is found to be without a proper dustbin, the Council may serve notice on the owner or occupier requiring provision to be made. The same Section provides that any person aggrieved may appeal to the London County Council. Similar provisions are contained in the Public Health Act, 1936, which applies to England and Wales outside the administrative County of London. Under that Act, however, any appeal against a notice has to be made to a court of summary jurisdiction. In the last two or three years, a number of such appeals have been made, some of them being subsequently taken to the Divisional Court. As a result, the principle has been established that, in deciding whether notice should be served on the owner or on the occupier, the local authority must consider all the circumstances of the individual case. Towards the end of 1949, the London County Council allowed an appeal by the owner of a house in another London Borough, and although the grounds on which this decision was made were not disclosed, there is little doubt but that they had the same principle in mind. It had previously been the practice of the Council, save in very exceptional circumstances, to regard the provision of dustbin accommodation as a matter for the owner, and accordingly to serve notice on him. In view, however, of the situation created by the various appeals referred to above, the Health Committee decided that in future the circumstances of each case (e.g., net rent of house, number of tenants, existence of any tenancy agreement, financial circumstances of the occupier, etc.) should be submitted to them for their decision as to whether the notice is to be served on the owner or occupier. It should be made clear that the right of appeal to the London County Council still remains. Common Lodging Houses. At the beginning of the year there was only one common lodging house in Battersea, this being the one for females at No. 67 Winstanley Road. The premises were authorised to accommodate 50 lodgers, and 10 inspections were carried out by the Council's inspector. The house was generally found to be in a sanitary condition, and conducted in accordance with the requirements of the by-laws, and it was not necessary to serve any notices in this connection. This house was closed in June, and there now remain no common lodging houses or Seamen's lodging houses in the Borough. Public Lavatory Accommodation. Five public conveniences for both sexes and one for females only are provided by the Council in various parts of the Borough, two being underground. In addition to the usual lavatory accommodation (at least one free water-closet being provided for each sex) facilities for washing are also provided. Three public urinals are also maintained. In addition, the urinals attached to seven licensed premises were, by arrangement with the owners, available to the general public at the beginning of the year. The arrangement in regard to one of them was, however, later terminated by the owners, but during the year similar arrangements were made in respect of two additional premises. 23 Drainage Work. The by-laws made by the London County Council under the Metropolis Management Acts with regard to drainage, and also those under the Public Health (London) Act relating to water-closets, etc., are enforced by the Council. During the year new drains were constructed to 228 new buildings, and the drains of 30 old buildings were partially or entirely reconstructed under the supervision of the Officers of the Department. 102 plans of proposed proposed drainage work were deposited in 1949, as compared with 112 in 1948. During the year drains were tested by smoke on 115 occasions, and 41 were found defective. The water test was applied on 503 occasions, us being mainly to drains in course of construction. The frontage drains of 20 premises were constructed or structed. Combined Drainage. year four claims were made by owners of houses drained combined operations that the common portions of those drainage systems were "sewers" within the meaning of the Public Health (London ) Act, 1936, and that the Council were consequently responsible for their maintenance. In the following two cases the Council admitted the liability and carried out the necessary works to the "sewers":— 94/102 Cabul Road. 122, 124, etc., Usk Road. In two cases, liability was repudiated, and the work was subsequently carried out by the owners at their own expense. Smoke Nuisances. During the year a number of complaints were made, alleging nuisances from smoke, dust, grit, etc., emitted from premises occupied by various industrial and public utility undertakings in the Borough, such complaints were carefully investigated. In the Annual Report for 1948, reference was made to serious emissions of smoke, grit, etc., from two public utility undertakings in the Borough. In one of them (an electricity generating station) the installation during 1949 of additional grit arresting and other plant of a similar nature reduced the emissions to a very material extent. In the other cases (a .gas works) little improvement can be reported, and does not seem likely to take place until the replacement of a large amount of plant of an obsolete type can be effected. This, it appears, is not likely to take place for a number of years. Apart from these two instances, the complaints related to emissions from various industrial plants. On investigation, they were found to be due to some transient cause such as the use of unsuitable fuel, or temporary breakdown of some part of the plant. No formal action was found necessary in any of these cases. The total number of observations made was 133. 24 Effluvium Nuisances. A small number of complaints alleging nuisance from effluvia emitted from various industrial and business premises were received. These were all investigated, and in certain instances no justification for the complaints could be found. In the remainder, the cause was investigated and the measures suggested resulted in the cessation of the nuisance without the need for recourse to formal action. Offensive Trades. There are two premises in the Borough at which scheduled offensive trades are carried on. These businesses have been established for many years and are satisfactorily conducted. Water Supply. During the year certificates under Section 95 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, were issued in respect of 228 new or re-erected dwelling houses or tenements. In one house an additional water supply on an upper floor was provided, in compliance with a notice served under Section 95 (5) of the Act. Twenty-four notices of waste of water from defective fittings, etc., observed during routine inspections of various premises, were sent to the Metropolitan Water Board. Periodical examination of the water supplies drawn from the deep wells at the Latchmere Baths was carried out during the year. The Public Analyst's reports on his examination of the samples showed that the water maintained a high degree of purity. These wells supply water not only to the Baths Establishment, but also to over 360 tenements on the Council's Latchmere Estate. Formerly, supplies were adequate for all these purposes, but of recent years the yield from the wells has fallen, so that supplies from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board have had to be drawn upon to an increasing extent. During the year, the Council decided to replace the existing air-lift pumps with electrically operated submersible pumps of modern design. It is hoped that, when these are installed, it will again be possible to obtain from the wells sufficient supplies for all requirements. Rag and Bone Dealers. Premises occupied by rag and bone dealers in the Borough are subjected to regular inspection. During the year 98 inspections were made. Various small irregularities found to exist were brought to the notice of the occupiers of the premises and were remedied without recourse to formal action. One case of an offence against that part of the by-laws relating to rag and bone dealers, which prohibits the giving of toys in exchange for rags, was reported by the Police. By direction of the Health Committee, legal proceedings were taken in this case, but the summons had not been issued at the end of the year. 25 Verminous Premises. The number of premises found to be infested with vermin (principally bed-bugs) was somewhat higher than for the year 1948, which, as stated in the Annual Report for that year, had shown a marked decrease on previous years. The increase was, no doubt, due to the exceptionally warm weather during the summer of 1949. During the year, 333 verminous premises, including 51 flats or houses on the Council's Estates, were treated. Van Dwellings. There are three sites in the Borough on which van dwellings have regularly been placed for many years. The number of vans on the sites varies from time to time. All the sites are subject to regular inspection and are in general reasonably well kept. Dangerous Structures. Eighty-eight cases in which structures or parts thereof had been noted, in the course of inspections for various purposes, as appearing to be unsafe, were referred to the District Surveyor of the London County Council for his attention. Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. The provisions of this Act, which give power to require steps to be taken to eradicate infestations of rats and mice, and to prevent infestations, are administered by the Council. The work is carried out by the Rodent Officer, assisted by three Rodent Operatives. All infestations coming to light, whether by way of complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated, and the necessary steps taken to deal with them. In some cases the occupier of the affected premises (who is the person primarily responsible under the Act), is called upon to take those steps, and in others the work is carried out by the Rodent Control Staff. In the latter event, the cost is recoverable from the occupier. Except in the case of business premises, where the cost is recovered in full, the charges made are usually nominal. At the same time, steps are taken to ascertain, and to secure the remedy of, the cause of the infestation. This is frequently found to be defective drainage or other defects in the building, for which the owner is responsible, and he is called upon to remedy the defects. The work of the Rodent Control Staff is, therefore, carried on in close co-operation with the Sanitary Inspectors. During the year, the Staff made 2,814 visits to 276 different premises. The sewers under the control of the Council were treated on two occasions to destroy rats. The method adopted was that recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, namely, to lay Prebait (unpoisoned) on two successive days, and to follow on the third day with poisoned bait. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, under the terms of their Circular N.S. No. 11, pay a grant of 50 per cent. towards the cost he service in so far as this is not recovered by the Council from occupiers of premises. 26 On the 30th July, 1949, the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, received Royal Assent. This Act repeals, and re-enacts with many alterations and additions, the provisions of the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. It does not, however, come into operation until the 31st March, 1950. Vacant Sites, Static Water Tanks, etc. Complaints continued to be made of nuisances caused by the dumping of rubbish in disused static water tanks, and on cleared sites and in derelict buildings, and by the accumulation of stagnant rainwater in static water tanks. In many cases, the rubbish consisted merely of builder's material, scrap metal, etc., which, although unsightly, could not be said to be a danger to health. In certain instances, however, dead animals, vegetable refuse, old bedding, and other material of a putrescible nature were found. It appears that the primary responsibility for abating any nuisance so caused rests upon the owner of the site, but in view of the difficulty and delay which would have arisen from any attempt to enforce this responsibility, the Council themselves undertook the removal of any such material causing or likely to cause danger to health, a special provision of £100 having been made for this purpose. In five cases where nuisance was being caused by water accumulating in static water tanks, however, the owners of the site were communicated with and requested to take steps to abate the nuisance and prevent its recurrence. As, however, it appears that the owners are entitled to compensation, under Section 2 (1) (b) of the Compensation (Defence) Act, 1939, further action was deferred to enable them to settle this matter. The negotiations had not been concluded by the end of the year. Burial of Deceased Persons. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are responsible for the burial or cremation of the body of any person dying or being found dead in the Borough, and have power to recover from the estate of the deceased person, or from any person who, under the Act, was liable to maintain the deceased immediately prior to his death, their expenses incurred in carrying out the duty, in so far as these expenses are not covered by any grant made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. During the year, 32 cases were dealt with, as per the following table:— Died in St. James's Hospital 20 „ ,, St. John's Hospital 7 „ „ Battersea General Hospital 2 „ at home 3 32 Only 9 of these persons were residents of Battersea. The number of cases falling to be dealt with by the Council would have been greater but for the fact that the Ministry of Health, in Circular 13/49, dated 1st March, 1949, requested Hospital Committees and Boards themselves to arrange for the burials of persons dying in their Hospitals in cases where there was no "liable" relative. 27 The burials arranged by the Council are carried out by a local undertaker under contract, and not more than one coach is provided for followers. The Health Department make the arrangements and collect all available information regarding any estate left by the deceased, particulars of his National Insurance, and the existence of any "liable" relatives. This information is passed to the Borough Treasurer so that he may take steps to recover the cost. The total cost incurred in dealing with the 32 cases was £200 9s. 10d., of which £72 6s. 6d. had been recovered by the end . of the year. Aged and Infirm Persons. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are empowered to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for the removal to a hospital or other suitable place of any person who is aged or infirm or suffering from some grave chronic disease, and is living under insanitary conditions. This power is exercisable on the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health. One such case was dealt with, the person concerned being a man of about 76 years of age who was living alone in a first floor flat under conditions which were clearly seriously detrimental to his own well-being and a menace to the health of other occupants of the house. His only relative was a brother who was himself an inmate of a mental hospital. The Order was duly made and the man removed to an institution under the control of the London County Council. A number of other cases of persons, mostly of advancing years, alleged to be living under unsatisfactory conditions, were reported. In none of these was there justification for certifying that an application for an Order for removal be made. In some cases, however, it was found possible to arrange voluntary admission to hospital, and other cases were under observation at the end of the year. Sale of Contraceptives from Automatic Machines. About the middle of the year it became known that contraceptives were being offered for sale from automatic machines attached to shop fronts, or in shop doorways, in such positions as to be directly accessible from the street without entering the shop. The Council considered this matter and decided to support representations which ad already been made by another London Borough to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, with a view to legislative powers of prohibition or control being conferred on local authorities. As a result, the Home Secretary issued a model of a by-law which could be made under Section 146 of the London Government Act, 1939. The Council at their meeting on the 2nd November made a by-law, on the lines of the model, prohibiting the offer of a contraceptive for sale by means of an automatic machine so placed that it can be used by persons in a street, the expression "Street" being defined as including a way or place over which the public have a right of passage, and also the forecourt of, or entrance to a building, provided that such a forecourt or entrance is exposed to the view of persons passing along the street, and that the public have unrestricted access to such forecourt or entrance. This by-law was duly confirmed and came 28 into operation on the 19th December, 1949. Immediately afterwards, inspections were made of the five shops where machines were known to have existed, but it was found that in all cases they had either been removed or were being used to sell other articles. No further offence came to light. PROTECTION OF FOOD SUPPLY. (A)—INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES. Regular inspection of all premises where food for human consumption is prepared, stored, or sold is carried out as a routine measure. In general, they are found to be conducted in a reasonably satisfactory manner, and the requirements of Section 13 (1) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and other statutory requirements complied with. Such irregularities as were found were mostly of a minor nature and remedy was secured without difficulty. Restaurant Kitchens. The number of restaurants and cafes (including fixed and mobile stalls) on the register at the end of the year was 158. 511 inspections were made, and 2 notices served for various defects. It has become increasingly obvious that the conditions under which much of the food is prepared in restaurants leave much to be desired, and there is a growing recognition of the amount of illness caused by the consumption of contaminated food. The Food and Drugs Act, 1938, lays down certain standards and requirements to be observed in places where food is prepared, stored and sold, but its provisions are necessarily in general terms, and in order to make them really effective in producing satisfactory conditions, food handlers, both employers and employed, must go beyond them by observing the basic principles underlying the production of clean food. It is however, unfortunately evident that the average food handler has very little idea of these principles. In order, therefore, to bring them to the notice of food handlers, and to encourage their observance, a Code of Standards for Catering Establishments was drawn up and was adopted by the Council at their meeting on the 27th July. This Code is set out in an appendix to this Report. It was circulated to the proprietors of 135 restaurants and 43 factory canteens at which a full range of meals is supplied. Legal proceedings were instituted against a firm of food manufacturers, and against one of their directors, for offences against Section 13 (1) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Before the summonses came before the Court it was learned that the firm had gone into liquidation, and they had to be withdrawn. Slaughterhouses. There is only one licensed slaughterhouse in the Borough. It is used only occasionally, for the slaughter of calves. Forty-nine visits were made to it during the year, and 13 calves were examined, all of which were passed as fit for human consumption. 29 Butchers' Shops. There are 73 butchers' shops in the Borough, and in addition a number of shops where cooked meats are sold. All these shops are systematically inspected, 1,379 visits having been made during the year. In general, the shops are well conducted, and no formal action was found necessary. Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924. A complaint was made by certain local residents that a man in charge of a van delivering meat to a butcher's shop had been seen to throw the meat from the van on to the pavement and thence drag it into the shop. Proceedings under Article 21 (2) of the Regulations were taken against him. The case was strongly defended, and the evidence of the persons who made the complaint, and who were the only witnesses available to the Council, proved so unreliable under cross-examination that the Court dismissed the case. No other offence against the Regulations was reported during the year. Dairies and Milkshops. The following table gives the dairies and milkshops registered in the Borough. and the changes during 1949:— (a) Dairies where loose milk is sold, and both the premises and the occupier are registered:- Retail wholesale Total On register at 1st January 52 7 59 Added during year 1 — 1 53 7 60 Removed during year:— (i) Premises closed 1 — 1 (ii) Transferred to (b) below 3 — 3 On register at 31st December 49 — 56 (b) Milkshops, where milk is sold only in sealed containers, and only the occupier is registered:— On register at 1st January 74 Added during year, by transfer from (a) above 3 Removed during year 77 On register at 31st December 77 A total of 333 visits were made to these shops during the year. Generally they are very well conducted. In 2 cases, however, it was found necessary to draw the occupier's attention to minor contraventions of the statutory requirements. These were rectified without recourse to formal action. 30 The Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, which came into operation on the 1st October, 1949, repealed and re-enacted with modifications and additions, the Milk and Dairies Orders, 1926 to 1943. The principal differences are:— (1) The registration and inspection of dairy farms is transferred from local authorities to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Local authorities, however, remain responsible for registration and inspection of all other milk premises. (2) The use of premises so situated as to lead to risk of contamination of milk is prohibited. (3) The walls of any room in which milk is handled, and which are liable to splashing by milk, or otherwise, must be smooth and impervious. (4) Distributors on receiving milk which has not already been cooled to 50° F. shall, without delay, so cool it. Exception to this is provided if the milk is to be passed on to the consumer, or to another distributor, in the same unopened container, or is to be heat-treated or used for manufacturing purposes. For a period of 5 years from the commencement of the Regulations, a distributor may, in certain circumstances, be authorised to cool milk to a temperature not more than 5° F. above that of the water available for cooling. (5) The use of an approved oxidising agent is now allowed, in lieu of scalding, for the cleansing of appliances. (6) Bottles or cartons containing milk must not be left on a public highway except on final delivery on retail sale, and any place used regularly for the deposit of milk for collection or for further conveyance shall be protected as far as possible from the direct rays of the sun. (7) The previous Regulations contained power to stop or restrict supplies of milk known or suspected to be infected with certain notifiable diseases. The new regulations extend this power to all diseases communicable to man. One case in which milk had been supplied to a consumer in a dirty bottle was reported. The Health Committee decided to prosecute in this case, but the Council's Solicitor, on consideration of the wording of Article 26 (1) of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, expressed the opinion that proceedings could be taken only by the local authority for the district in which the milk bottle was actually filled. The Ministry of Food, to whom the point was referred for guidance, confirmed this opinion, and the matter was therefore referred to the authority in question. It was subsequently learned that proceedings were taken and were successful, a fine of £20 and costs being imposed. Milk (Special Designations). The Milk (Special Designations) Act, 1949, which came into operation on the 1st October, 1949, makes it obligatory for all milk sold by retail for human consumption in areas specified by the Minister of Food to be sold under a special designation. These designations are to be prescribed by Regulations. Sales to the public as refreshments are exempt, but there are special provisions governing the bulk purchase of milk by caterers. The Minister has power to dispense with any of these requirements in special circumstances. 31 Two sets of Milk (Special Designations) Regulations have been issued and came into operation on the same date as the Act. One sets relates to raw milk (i.e., milk not treated by heat) and the other to Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk. Four designations are prescribed Accredited, tuberculin Tested, Pasteurised and Sterilised. The first three were provided for in the old Orders, but the last is a new one. Accredited milk may not be heat treated, but Tuberculin Tested may be pasteurised or sterilised provided it is so described. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries issues licences to producers of raw milk, but Food and Drugs Authorities issue all dealers', sterilisers', and pasteurisers' licences. The Regulations lay down conditions to be observed in the transport, handling, treatment and distribution of nated milks, the tests they must satisfy, and instructions as to the collection of samples. These follow, in general, the lines of the old Orders. Both the "Holder" and the "High Temperature Short Time" methods of pasteurisation are permitted, and pasteurised milk must comply with the "phosphatase" and "methylene blue" tests. Sterilised milk must be filtered or clarified, homogenised, and heated to and maintained at a temperature of not less than 212° F. for such time as will ensure that it complies with the prescribed "turbidity" test. This treatment must take place in bottles which must be hermetically The Regulations provide for the refusal, revocation or suspension of licences if the prescribed conditions are not met, with right of appeal by any aggrieved person to the licensing authority and subsequently to the Minister of Food. No fees are now payable for licences. The number of licences issued by the Council during 1949 was as follows:- Full Supplementary Accredited — — Tuberculin Tested 34 17 Pasteurised 59 18 Sterilised 79 20 172 55 Two licences to pasteurise, and one to sterilise milk were issued, and are included in the above figures. Details of examination of samples of heat-treated milk are given on page 37. Ice Cream Premises. The number of premises registered for the manufacture, storage, and/or sale of ice cream at the end of the year was 86, 24 having been added and 1 removed during the course of the year. All these premises are regularly inspected. 272 visits were made and 1 notice served. Particular attention is paid to premises where manufacture takes place, and not only are the premises, plant, and Methods of operation scrutinised, but samples of the product are taken for examination by the methods suggested by the Ministry of Health. The premises generally are found to be well conducted. Further Reference to sampling of ice cream will be found on page 38. 32 Fish Shops. Shops in which fish, either cooked or uncooked, is sold, or where the curing or smoking of fish is carried on, are regularly inspected. There were 57 such shops in the Borough in 1949. 226 inspections were made, and 1 notice was served, for minor matters which were remedied without difficulty. Street Stalls. All street stalls from which food for human consumption is sold are regularly inspected and, where the food sold is stored in the Borough, the storage places are also inspected. It was not found necessary to take any formal action during the year. Unsound Food. The following table gives particulars of the unsound foodstuffs which, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 180 (8), were voluntarily surrendered to the Council. Most of these foodstuffs were ultimately used for the manufacture of animal feeding stuffs. Fish (preserved) 1,634 tins, 15 boxes „ (fresh) 94 boxes, 69 lbs. Meat and sausages (preserved) 1,025 tins, 1 case, 9 lbs. Meat and sausages (fresh) 1,879¼ lbs., 8 cases, 1 box, 1 barrel Poultry 520 lbs.

All were reported to the Health Committee, on whose instructions they were dealt with by cautionary letter. 33 Food Poisoning. During the year three cases of food poisoning were notified. All were isolated cases and of a minor nature, and call for no special comment. PROTECTION OF FOOD SUPPLY. (B)—SAMPLING OF FOOD AND DRUGS. The analysis of samples of food and drugs, procured under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, or informally (i.e., without following the procedure prescribed by the Act), and the examination of samples of heat-treated milk and of ice-cream by the prescribed tests, is carried out by the Public Analyst for the Borough (J. E. Woodhead, Esq., B.SC., F.R.I.C., PH.C.) at his laboratory at 325 Kennington Road, London, S.E.11. In June, 1949, the Council, with the approval of the Minister of Food, appointed Ronald S. Hatfull, Esq., F.R.I.C. (Branch E), who is principal Laboratory Assistant to Mr. Woodhead, to be Deputy Public Analyst. The total number of formal samples taken under the Act during 1949 was 592, of which 12, or 2.0 per cent., were certified to be adulterated. In addition, 608 informal samples were procured, of which 6, or 1.0 per cent., were reported against. The percentage of samples reported by the Public Analyst to be adulterated during the quinquennia 1921 to 1945 and yearly from 1946, is given in the following table : Year Formal samples (per cent.) Informal samples (per cent.) Mean 1921—1925 6.4 7.4 „ 1926—1930 3.3 2.4 „ 1931—1935 1.8 2.1 „ 1936—1940 0.9 0.9 „ 1941—1945 1.4 1.1 1946 1.5 1.2 1947 0.5 1.7 1948 0.7 0.3 1949 2.0 1.0 The somewhat higher figure for adulterated formal samples is explained by the fact that it includes seven samples of milk taken from the same consignment. 34 The following tables give details of the articles of which samples were obtained for the purpose of analysis.

Of the 421 samples of milk, all of which were formal samples, ten were reported as adulterated, all, however, to a small degree. Seven of these adulterated samples were from one consignment. In the five years 1944-1948, and in 1949, the percentage of adulterated (formal) samples of milk was as under:— Year Samples taken Adulterated No. Percentage 1944 462 5 11 1945 459 2 0.4 1946 430 0 0.0 1947 415 0 0.0 1948 402 0 0.0 Mean 433.6 1.4 0.3 1949 421 10 2.4 37 The average composition of the 411 samples of milk reported as genuine, proved to be as under:— Total milk solids 12.43 per cent. Milk fat 3.62 " Non-fatty solids 8.81 " The Analyst reports that the content of milk fat in these 411 samples ranged as follows:— 4 per cent. and over 42 samples or 10.2 per cent.

No. 584 Non-brewed vinegar—5 per cent. deficient in acetic acid. Cautionary letter. Heat Treated Milk. Samples of heat treated milk are taken at regular intervals for submission to the Public Analyst for the prescribed tests, and during the year samples as under were taken with the results set out:— Phosphatase Methylene Satisfactory Blue Failed Turbidity* Satisfactory Failed Satisfactory Failed Pasteurised 20 - 17 3 - - Heat Treated 37 - 35 2 - - Sterilised 16 - 16 - 6 - * This test did not come into operation until 1st October. Monthly returns of the samples taken, and of the results of the examinations, are sent to the Milk Division of the Ministry of Food, and they are at once notified of any adverse report. 38 Milk supplied to Schools and Hospitals. Samples of milk in course of delivery to Schools and Hospitals in the Borough are regularly taken, both for chemical analysis and, where the milk is supplied under a "Special Designation," for submission to the prescribed tests for such milk. These samples are included in the general totals given on pages 35, 36 and 37. The results of the analyses and tests are communicated to the London County Council or to the appropriate Hospital Management Committee. Ice Cream. Fifty-eight samples of ice cream were taken during the year, each sample being submitted to the presumptive test for coliform organisms in 3 tubes at 1/10 ml. dilution, and to the methylene blue test, in accordance with the technique suggested by the Ministry of Health. The following is a summary of the results:— Coliform Test. Methylene Blue Test. Negative 26 Provisional Grade 1 19 Positive in 1 tube 4 „ ,, 2 15 „ „ 2 tubes 3 „ „ 3 7 „ „ 3 tubes 25 „ „ 4 17 58 58 Although these results represent a distinct improvement over those recorded for the year 1948, they are still far from satisfactory, especially in view of the fact that all ice cream is, by virtue of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, &c.) Regulations, 1947, now required to be subjected to a prescribed method of heat treatment, unless it is made by the "complete cold mix" process from materials already subjected to heat treatment. Where samples of ice cream made at premises in the Borough received unsatisfactory reports, the premises, plant, and methods of operation were examined, and, where possible, improvements were suggested. It is worthy of comment that some of the poor samples were of ice cream made by reputable manufacturers, operating the most up-to-date plant, and usually wrapping the product at the place of manufacture. It is difficult to explain why this should be so. The Ministry of Food have requested that the results of any samples of ice cream taken for chemical analysis be forwarded to them, for the reason that certain manufacturers are allowed additional sugar and fat on condition that they give an undertaking that the fat content of their product will not fall below 2½ per cent. Five such samples were taken during the year, and the fat content was found to vary from 1.56 per cent. to 5.24 per cent. Details were sent to the Ministry. 39 Housing. Provision of New Accommodation. Sheepcote Lane Area. Redevelopment by the Council of the first section of this area, which was the subject of a Clearance Order made prior to the war, was completed during 1948. Work on an extension of the original area was put in hand during 1948, and 24 flats were completed in 1949. Hibbert Street Area. Redevelopment of this area, comprising Hibbert Street, Linda Street, and parts of Wynter Street, Maysoule Road, Hope Street, and York Road, is being carried out by the London on County Council. During the year, 5 blocks, containing 172 flats, were completed. 19/20 Bolingbroke Grove. This site was formerly that of the Council's Maternity Hospital, which was closed in 1938. During 1948, the buildings were demolished and the erection of 27 new flats was completed in 1949. Shirley Grove/Wickersley Road; 6 Nightingale Lane; Nightingale Lane/Hendnck Avenue. Redevelopment of these sites by the Council was commenced during 1949. Other Permanent Housing Sites. Consideration was given during the year by this Council, and by the London County Council, to the acquisition of further sites with a view to their redevelopment as housing sites. Private Enterprise. During the year 2 houses, which had been demolished by enemy action, were rebuilt by the owners, providing 5 self-contained flats. The rebuilding of 23 houses on a privately owned housing estate, (emolished by enemy action in 1944, was commenced. Summarv of New Accommodation Provided. Flats By Battersea Borough Council 51 By London County Council 172 By Private Enterprise 5 228 Conversion of Existing Houses. During the year the Council converted into flats 10 houses held under requisition. Thirty-seven family units were made available Repair of Unfit Houses. Whole, as stated in the paragraph on the operation of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 (vide page 21), that Act continued to afford the main means by which the remedy of insanitary conditions in dwelling houses was effected, the limited use of the provisions of Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936, resumed towards towards the end of 1948 after having been discontinued since the outbreak of the war, was continued. 40 Prior to the war, it was the practice, in deciding whether or not a house could be repaired at reasonable cost, to regard any house where the estimated cost of the work exceeded 50 per cent of the value of the house when repaired, as not so repairable, and action was then started under Section 11 with a view to a Demolition Order being made. In view, however, of the substantial increase in building costs during and since the war, and the necessity for preserving as many houses as possible, the Council reconsidered the matter, and decided that each case should be considered on its merits. Accordingly, the Housing Committee, before coming to a decision, consider not only the estimated cost of the repairs, but also the net rent of the house, the accommodation it provides, its estimated life, and any other relevant factors. In order to give owners the opportunity to deal with their houses on a voluntary basis, and to lessen the number of formal notices (which by reason of the rather involved procedure required by the Act involves a considerable amount of administrative work), it is the practice, whenever it is decided to deal with a house under the Act, to send an informal notice to the person in control, calling his attention to the fact that defects exist (but without specifying them), requesting him to attend to them, and suggesting that he meets the Sanitary Inspector at the house to discuss details. If this fails, within a reasonable time, to produce results, a specification of the works and an estimate of their cost is prepared and submitted to the Housing Committee, with the other details referred to above, for their decision. From the start of the new procedure to the end of 1949, 36 houses were dealt with, informal notices being served in each case. In 17 of these, the work was satisfactorily carried out without recourse to formal action. In 10 cases, however, formal notices under Section 9 had to be served, and 5 of these were complied with. In addition, work was in hand at the end of the year under 3 informal and 1 formal notices. Of the remaining 4 formal notices, the times allowed for compliance expired shortly before the end of the year, and steps were being taken for the Council to execute the work in default. In the remaining case the time had not expired. Any person on whom a formal notice is served has a right of appeal, within 21 days of service, to the County Court, but in no instance was this right exercised. Closing Orders. Eleven Closing Orders under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, were made during the year, nine in respect of basement rooms and two in respect of attic rooms. Following a survey in 1948 of all parts of houses in respect of which Closing Orders had been made by the Council in past years, the Housing Committee ordered proceedings to be taken in one case of the illegal occupation of two underground rooms. Summonses were issued against both the occupier and the landlord, and were heard at the beginning of 1949. The case against the occupier was dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907. The landlord was fined £5 for permitting the offence, and ordered to pay £2 2s. costs. 41 In another case of the illegal occupation of an underground room found during the 1948 survey, the room was found to be occupied by a sub-tenant of the main tenant. The matter was taken up with both persons at the time, and it transpired that the main tenant was unaware of the existence of the Closing Order. As the room was immediately vacated by the sub-tenant, the matter was not pursued any further. Early in 1949, however, it was reported that the main tenant was himself using this room as a living room. The Housing Com- mittee authorised proceedings to be taken, and a fine of £ 1 was imposed, and £1 1s. costs were awarded against the defendant. Demolition Orders. During 1949 no houses were demolished under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936. One Demolition Order under this Section was mede by the Council in respect of a dwelling house, as it was considered that repairs could not be carried out at a reasonable cost, but the time allowed for compliance had not expired at the end of Houses Let in Lodgings. No special action was taken in respect of such houses. Overcrowding. 459 cases of overcrowding were discovered during teh year, 337 in consequence of applications for housing accommodation made to this Council, and 122 to the London County Council. In some of these cases it appeared that the circumstances were such as to give rise to an affence against the relevant provisions of the Housing Act, 1936, and in two cases legal action was taken. In the first case, proceedings were taken under Section 59 (1) of the Act, and, after the Magistrate had adjourned the case three times, he fined the defendant 10s. and ordered him to pay 10s. costs. The overcrowding was not abated, and the the Housing Committee gave instructions that the case should be deferred for six months. This period had not expired at the end of the year. In the second case, proceedings for possession were taken under Section 66 of the Housing Act. Prior to the case being heard, however, the defendant gave an undertaking that two members of his family would sleep elsewhere, thus reducing, though not abating, the overcrowding. In view of this undertaking, the Magistrate agreed to the Council's request that he adjourn sine die the application for possession of the accommodation. The defendant was warned that if the position was worsened in any way, by the return of the two members of the family or otherwise, the Council would consider reviving the application for possession. Seventy-six overcrowded families were rehoused during the year, 45 by this Council and 31 by the London County Council. 42 Housing Accommodation Applications. All applications made to the Council are normally dealt with by the Housing Manager, who refers to me those cases in which the application is based wholly or partly on medical grounds. These cases include applications for transfer from Council tenants and licensees of requisitioned premises. He also refers certain cases in which some special feature is involved (e.g., fitness of basement rooms). From the beginning of the year until the end of October, 606 cases were dealt with, and the following recommendations were made :- Rehousing essential 122 „ advisable 185 No recommendation 299 Sixty-nine families, in respect of which "essential" recommendations had been given, were rehoused during the year. In October, the Council adopted a "Points Scheme" to deal with applications for housing accommodation. Under this scheme, points are allocated by the Housing Manager for statutory overcrowding; bedroom deficiency; lack of a separate home, etc., and he still refers cases of ill-health and unsuitable accommodation, for which points up to a maximum of 10 can be allocated under each heading. Each case is placed in a group according to the number of bedrooms required by the family. Cases with the highest number of points in each group are submitted to the Housing Committee for instructions. The Points Scheme came into force at the beginning of November, and at the end of the year the Housing Manager's staff were still engaged in "pointing" the applications. This scheme does not apply to applications for transfers from Council or requisitioned property, which are still dealt with under the previous system. The London County Council also refer cases in which there appears to be overcrowding, for the submission, in appropriate cases, of an " orange form." Overcrowding was found to exist in 122 instances. The London County Council also notify cases in which the application alleges sanitary defects. The houses are inspected and action to secure the remedy of any defects found is taken. Increase of Rent, &c., Acts. Five certificates that houses or parts thereof were not in a reasonable state of repair were issued to tenants. Five reports that houses or parts thereof were in a reasonable state of repair were issued to landlords. 43 Statistics for the Year ended 31st December, 1949.

During the year, 66 lists of outworkers were received, 33 from Battersea employers, containing 280 names, and 33 from other authorities containing 156 names. Some of these lists included outworkers not residing in Battersea. These were forwarded to the appropriate authorities. After eliminating them, and duplicate entries, there remained 248 names and addresses of Battersea outworkers. The total number of registered outworkers' premises in the Borough at the end of the year was 338 (including 9 contractors), 139 premises having been added, and 55 removed, during the year. The total number of inspections made was 1,150, most of them by the female Inspector. The premises were found to be generally satisfactory, and it was not found necessary to serve any notices or take any other action. One case of infectious disease occurred at an outworker's premises, and the usual precautions to prevent spread of infection were taken. The following table gives details of the outworkers' premises :— Trade Number on Register Persons employed Premises Workrooms Wearing Apparel 177 184 201 Curtains, etc. 3 3 3 Artificial Flowers 7 7 7 Boxes, etc. 7 7 7 Lampshades 144 146 159 338 347 377 47 Bakehouses. There were 40 bakehouses on the register at the end of the year. All of these are classed as factories, and 37 of them use mechanical power. Forty-two inspections were made and 3 notices served for defects of various kinds, all of which were complied with. Eight of these are "basement bakehouses" within the meaning of the Factories Act, 1937. One such bakehouse ceased to be used during the year in consequence of the withdrawal by the Council of the Certificate of Suitability in December, 1948. The remaining eight were all inspected in accordance vvith the requirements of Section 47 of the Act. and the Health Committee, after giving full consideration to these reports, decided to wihdraw the Certificates in respect of a further two bakehouses. Notices to that effect were served on the owners on the 3rd August, allowing a period of twelve months. As no appeal was made, both these bakehouses will cease to be used as such after 3rd August, 1950. In the remaining six cases, the Committee decided that the Certificates should continue in operation, subject to further consideration at the end of the next quinquennial period. Miscellaneous Matters. Student Sanitary Inspectors. During the year practical training was given to three student sanitary inspectors, under the Government's Special Scheme for the training of Sanitary Inspectors. Each of these students attended in the Public Health Department for a period of eight weeks, and spent similer periods with each of two other local authorities. In addition, practical training was given to three members of the Clerical Staff of the Health Department who are studying for the Qualifying Certificate, at such times as they could be spared from their normal duties. One of them, Mr. J. W. M. Meston, sat for and obtained his Qualifying Certificate.

During the year 1949 there were 2,773 children and 286 adults cleansed and treated at the station. Of the 2,773 children attending, 401 were suffering from scabies or itch, a contagious parasitic skin affection. The remainder were verminous. Of these children 2,682 attended from the public elementary schools in the Borough by arrangement with the London County Council, who have entered into a contract with the Battersea Borough Council for the use of their Personal Cleansing Station. The cleansing and treatment of the school children is carried out under the supervision of officers of the London County Council while the disinfestation of the clothing and (if necessary) of the homes is carried out concurrently by the Borough Council s sanitary staff.
