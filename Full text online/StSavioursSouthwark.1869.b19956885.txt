Metropolis Local Management Act. BOARD OF WORKS for the ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT. THE FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT. LONDON: PRINTED BY H. SILVERLOCK, 92, BLACKFRIARS ROAD. S.E. MDCCCLXX. ABSTRACT OF ACCOUNTS of the St. Saviour's District Board of Works, For the Twelve Months ending 25th March, 1870, and R E P O R T S of the CLERK, MEDICAL OFFICER, & SURVEYOR OF THE BOARD. Compiled and published in accordance with the 198th section of 18 and 19 Vict., c. 120—" An Act for the better Local Management of the Metropolis," and respectfully presented to the Inhabitants of the District. CLERK'S REPORT. Since the publication of the last Annual Report of Proceeding's of this District Board of Works, the following alterations have been made in the nomenclature of streets within the District, and numbering of the houses therein, viz:— Norfolk Street, Great Guildford Street, has been incorporated with Orange Street under the latter name, and the houses in both streets have been re-numbered throughout, pursuant to an Order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated 7th May, 1869. Bridge Street has been incorporated with the Southwark Bridge Road under the latter name, and the houses renumbered, pursuant to Order, dated 30th July, 1869. The contract for lighting the District having expired on the 24th of June last, the Board made an arrangement with the Phœnix Gas Company for continuing the supply of gas for the public lamps ; and, as will be seen on reference to the list of contracts at page 30, a fresh contract has been entered into for 4 seven years, on terms somewhat similar to the last. Fresh contracts have also been entered into for three years in respect of paviors' work, masons' work, cleansing, and collection of dust, and for the season in respect of watering the roads. Mr. Woods' tenancy. The Board have let to Mr. Woods for a term of three years, under agreement, at the yearly rent of £6, a small piece of ground in Green Street, adjoining the Infant School; the same having been given up to the Board by the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company on the formation of their line of railway. Purchase of Stone. In October last the Board received an offer from Messrs. Mowlem & Co. to dispose of the carriage-way pavement which they were about to remove from London Bridge, at the price of 7s. 6d. per superficial yard (including dressing, re-laying, and grouting), and finding the stone to be in good condition and not much reduced in thickness, the Board considered the offer an advantageous one and agreed to purchase the stone; and, shortly afterwards they paved with it Church Street and Great Charlotte Street, Blackfriars Road, both of which streets were previously macadamized. Subsequently they received an offer from Messrs. Mowlem, and contracted also to purchase a quantity of similar stone from the Holborn Valley Works, at the same price per yard, and this has been laid in the Southwark Bridge Road on the approach to the bridge, in continuation of the pavemeut which was laid in the year 1868. The contract price for new granite cubes of a like description was considerably more than the price named. Blackfriars Road. The Board have also determined to pave, with new granite cubes, the portion of the Blackfriars Road from where the existing pavement terminates, near the bridge, to Church Street, at an estimated expense of £2,000; and they are in treaty with the Provident Clerks' Life Assurance Association for an advance of the money at 4¾ per cent. interest and re-payment of principal in ten years by equal annual instalments. Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867. By Order of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, " The portion of the Blackfriars Road from Charlotte Street to the bridge being within the ' General Limits' of the ' Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867,' is to be deemed to be within the ‘ Special Limits’ of the Act." The effect of this order is, inter alia, to render illegal the removal of dust from the houses in the portion of the Blackfriars Road referred to, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 7 p.m., and also the loading and unloading of coal, and removal of casks by means of ropes, chains, &c., between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Wellington Street, Borough, High Street, Duke Street, and Tooley Street, have, by a former order, been brought within the " Special Limits " of the Act. 5 The Board have recently born in communication with the Chief Commissioner of Police in reference to the Sunday trading carried on in Great Charlotte Street by itinerant venders and hawkers of various goods; and a deputation from the Board, accompanied by the Rector and Vestry Clerk of the parish of Christchurch, have waited upon Mr. Brock, the Home Secretary, with a view to obtaining an abatement of the evil. In conformity with an Order received from the Metropolitan Board under the " Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act, 1869," this Board have issued a Precept to the Overseers of the Poor of the respective Parishes of Christchurch and St. Saviour for payment of the amounts assessed upon the Saint Saviour's District in respect thereof; such assessment being as under:— Christchurch.

The whole of the Macadamized Roads and Streets have been repaired, partly with new granite and with old material from stone-yard and other places. THOS GREENSTREET, Surveyor. 8 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, The mortality of the Saint Saviour's District, in the year 1808, was exceptionally low. The number of deaths was not only smaller than that of any previous year upon the records of this Board—and consequently far below the average—but was comparatively smaller than in most other Districts of London. The continuance of so favourable a state of the public health, as indicated by this death-rate, could not reasonably have been expected, and therefore it is satisfactory to know that although the deaths in the District, during the year I860, exceeded those recorded in the year preceding by 100, still the rate was much below the average of the last ten years; and that, in comparison with the Southern Districts and the whole of London the returns are most encouraging, so far as the District is concerned. I have observed, in previous Reports, that calculations for comparison are based upon the census of 18G1, and that doubtless, many Districts, and also the whole of the Metropolis, have increased in population in a greater proportion than has occurred in your District. In spite of these modifying considerations, however, it is unquestionable that St. • Saviour's occupies an enviable position in a sanitary point of view. The Registrar-General will again shortly number the population, and it will then be possible to make an exact comparison with the other Districts of London. The most noticeable feature of the public health, during the past year, was the appearance and prevalence of Relapsing Fever. This disease is almost unknown in England, and therefore, for the information of the Public, it is desirable to mention the chief symptoms. Like many other epidemics it has been almost exclusively confined to the poorer classes. It is contagious, but much less fatal than Scarlet or Typhus Fever; it generally commences with chilliness; there is but little eruption of the skin, and that not of specific character; the mind is usually clear, but the bodily pain much greater than in more fatal fevers ; the skin becomes heated, the pulse quick, the liver enlarged, the breathing rapid and painful ; vomiting generally occurs, and frequently constipation. These symptoms terminate abruptly about the sixth day, with profuse perspiration and a slow pulse ; the patient anticipates a speedy recovery, is able to leave his bed, and in most cases, 9 enjoys a good appetite—when suddenly, about the fourteenth day from 1 he common cement of the disease, a relapse occurs, and the fever runs the same Course, but generally terminates earlier than the first attack. Of course there are variations of these febrile symptoms. In your own District at least one case occurred in which there was a second relapse. As this disease is highly contagious, means were taken to obtain from the Relieving Officers and the earliest information of its outbreak in the different localities of the District, and whenever possible the patients were removed to the Hospital at Hampstead, specially provided to meet the emergency. All bedding and clothing likely to carry the seeds of the disease was destroyed, and the rooms thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. It may be fairly presumed that these measures materially contributed in limiting its ravages, and it is satisfactory to know that only one death is recorded, in this District. as caused Relapsing Fever. Yon will observe from the statistical tables which I have the honour to submit to your perusal and consideration, that there has been total increase of 72 deaths from Zymotic diseases. Only 1 death is recorded from Small Pox, and 19 from Typhus; but Measles and Scarlet Fever have been more fatal than during the preceding year. The death-rate was higher among persons under 20 years of age and above 60; and lower among those between the ages of 20 and 60. The births in the District exceeded the deaths by 222, and for the first time there were more of each in Christchurch than in St. Saviour's. Thirty-seven Coroner's inquisitions were held during the year. These cases represent deaths from sudden, violent, or accidental causes. The Workhouse has maintained its character for healthiness during the year; the mortality was a little higher than in the year preceding, but the increase was proportionately less than in that of the rest of the District. In my last Report I referred to the proposed scheme of building an Asylum for the sick poor of the parishes comprised in the Sick Asylum District. That intention has been since abandoned, and arrangements are being made to utilise the three existing Workhouses for classification of the inmates. The want of cleanliness among the poor, and the over-crowding of their dwellings, are still among the greatest difficulties with which Sanitary Officers have to contend. During the recent 10 prevalence of fever some most sickening scenes were witnessed; and in more instances than one, difficulty was experienced in inducing the men to remove the bedding and cleanse the apartments of the sick. The amalgamation of the four parishes which now form the St. Saviour's Union, will probably produce one good effect. It gives the poor in crowded districts an extended area in which to reside, without losing their claim on the Guardians for relief. Probably, when this is more generally understood, the poorer classes will be more equally distributed over the entire Union. This advantage, together with a judicious application of the powers conferred by the " Act to provide better Dwellings for Artisans and Labourers," will, doubtless, eventually mitigate the evil of over-crowding, and afford more healthy and comfortable homes for the poor. The virtue of cleanliness will be more highly appreciated when better accommodation is found, and when the progress of education has imparted more self-respect to the impoverished classes. The water supply is unhappily, still intermittent, and during the year, that of the Companies supplying the South of London was, on several occasions, very impure. The important influence of water upon the health of the people is so universally recognised, that more than ordinary attention is being devoted to the subject. Professor Frankland was again engaged during the year in testing the purity of waters of the Metropolitan Water Companies; and it appeared that of the twelve occasions when he analysed the Lambeth and Southwark Waters, they were clear and transparent the fewest number of times, and very turbid the largest number—that living organisms were seen in the waters of the Southwark Company on eight out of twelve occasions, and in the Lambeth waters on five occasions. In the water of three other Companies none were discovered. This frequent impurity induced the Privy Council to direct an enquiry to be made into its causes, and Mr. Radcliffe, who was entrusted with the investigation, reports that " he found the turbidity of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company's water to be due : 1st, to deficiency of provision for subsidence ; 2nd, insufficiency of area of filtering surface; 3rd, in certain instances, to the admission of tidal water from the Thames into the reservoirs at Battersea, either by direct inflow, by soakage, or by leakage ; and 4th, to the admission of unfiltered water from the subsidence reservoirs into the pump wells." Mr. Radcliffe adds that " it should be required absolutely of the Company that the communication of the reservoirs at Battersea with the tidal portion of the Thames by means of the old conduit leading to Battersea Reach, and the direct communication of the subsidence reservoirs with the pumping wells, should be entirely cut off." 11 As regards the turbidity of the Lambeth Company's water, Mr. Radcliffe reports “ that it is due, 1st, to the objectionable source of supply (the intake being, like that of the Chelsea Company, below the junction of the turbid Mole with the Thames); 2nd, to insufficient provision for subsidence; and 3rd, to insufficient apparatus for filtration." The Southwark Company has recently improved its filtering apparatus, and was, in consequence, enabled during the latter part of the year to supply perfectly clear and transparent water. The water of the Lambeth Company delivered in December was extremely turbid, from which it may be inferred that no substantial improvement has been made in its arrangements. It thus appears that it is quite possible to deliver in London water reasonably safe for drinking purposes; and it is manifestly the duty of Sanitary Hoards and their officers to continue to ventilate the subject until it is obtained without contamination, and so purified as to render its domestic use entirely free from risk. 1 have thus endeavoured briefly to indicate the chief points suggested by the statistics which I present for your perusal. You will perceive that a large amount of sanitary work has been done. Your Inspector has shown his accustomed vigilance in detecting and removing nuisances, and visiting premises requiring his inspections, and it may reasonably be assumed that these measures have tended to arrest the advance of disease. Death cannot be abolished, but life may be extended; and it is a testimony to the wisdom of our legislature that since the establishment of Boards, such as this, London has become one of the most healthy cities in the world. Doubtless the general want of employment during the past year exercised a considerable influence upon the health of the poor, and it is a matter for deep thankfulness that plentiful harvests have been granted during such seasons. Had this dearth of employment been accompanied by scarcity of food, it is impossible to say to how much greater an extent fevers and other diseases incident to times of want might have prevailed. In conclusion I have again to thank the Board and its officers for their kindness and courtesy during the past year. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT BIANCHI. 12 PARISH OF CHRISTCHURC H—Population at Census, 1861, 17,030.
