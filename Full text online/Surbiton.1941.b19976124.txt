ANNUAL REPORT OP THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1941. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 2, Shalston Villas, Surbiton. September, 1942. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I am submitting my twentieth Annual Report concerning the health of the district of Surbiton. » In view of the fact that I am requested by the Ministry of Health to confine myself to the very essentials only, and not to make known population or other figures which might lead to an estimation of the population of this Borough, I am withholding certain of the vital statistics. As may be expected, there has been an increase in the incidence of ,Pulmonary ,Tuberculosis, details of which will bo found in the Report under the respective heading. Also, there has been a rise in the number of cases of "Diphtheria from nine in 1940 to 16 in 1941. Generally speaking, the health of the district remains the same as in previous years. STATISTICS.

With reference to the table on the previous page, the increase of Diphtheria is shown to be within the years 5-10 and 10-15, in spite of the fact that a considerable number of diphtheria immunisations were carried out in these particular age groups. You will note that there were two deaths from Diphtheria, neither of which was immunised. TUBERCULOSIS . Under the Public Health Tuberculosis Regulations a register of all notifications is kept and weekly returns of cases are sent to the County Medical Officer, The continual movement of cases from one district to another requires constant supervision so that particulars can be brought up to date and represent a true record. At the end of the year 244 persons were shown to bo suffering from the disease and living within the; district Pul. Non-Pul. Males 106 31 Females S3 24 189 55 With reference to the under-mentioned table, you will find that the greatest increase lies between 15-24 and 25-34, at which period of life Pulmonary Tuberculosis is readily contracted.

At the commencement of the year there were 208 cases of Tuberculosis on the register and at the end of the year this figure had increased to 244. During the year 5 cases were notified as recovered from the disease, 25 patients left the district, and there were 25 deaths. Of the 94 new cases, it is interesting to note that 64 of these were cases first notified in this district. Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OP THE AREA. Water Supply. The water supply throughout the District is furnished by the Metropolitan Water Board and is a constant supply of excellent quality. I am supplied with monthly reports by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. Drainage and Sewerage. Extensive schemes have been prepared for soil and surface water drainage in the Borough, and would in the ordinary course of events be in hand. The schemes, however, have been deferred owing to the outbreak of hostilities. During the past year a certain amount of damage has injured sewers, but after considerable first aid treatment they are now satisfactory. Swimming' Baths and Pools . . Publicly-owned Baths. Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, Surbiton, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide with a depth of 3 to 9 feet. The water is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by injection of chlorine, and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodic samples of the water are talcen by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor and the plant adjusted accordingly. In addition, check samples are taken by the Public Health Department. In conclusion, I should like to thank Mr. McClelland, the Chief Sanitary Inspector, the other Sanitary Inspectors, and the clerical staff for their loyal and conscientious service throughout the year. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, NEVILLE H. LINZEE, Medical Officer of Health. 12 . ANNUAL REPORT OP THE CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR.

Fevered and tubercular. During the year the carcases and offal of 23 pigs slaughtered in the Borough were inspected. One was found affected with pleurisy and peritonitis. Two suspected food poisoning incidents were investigated. In one case two persons were stricken with acute illness and were removed to hospital; both, fortunately, recovered after treatment. This outbreak was believed to be due to eating tinned salmon. In the second case a death occurred, and a post mortem examination revealed that it was probably duo to food poisoning. Enquiries failed to reveal the food responsible, although suspicion rested on cold mutton. The number of complaints received both from traders and customers with regard to food of all descriptions has never been so high as during this year, and a lot of time was occupied in dealing with these matters.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Proceedings were taken against a firm of caterers for selling in a canteen meat which was unfit for human consumption. They were found guilty and fined £5, together with £5. 5. Od. costs, on each of two summonses. DISINFECTION. During the year disinfection was carried out at 50 premises following cases of infectious disease, and at 18 other premises on payment. Fifteen books from the Public Library were disinfected by fumigation. ERADICATION OF BED BUGS. 1. Council Houses . Other Houses. Found to be infested. Dis infested. Found to be infested.

To ensure that the belongings of now Council house tenants are free from vermin, an inspection is made by a Sanitary Inspector before removal. Where bed bugs are found, the furniture and other belongings are treated by spraying with insecticide and the bedding by steam disinfection, or, with the tenants' consent, the bedding is destroyed PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year 61 bodies were received into the Mortuary, 60 post mortem examinations carried out, and 18 inquests held. This does not include deaths from war operations. SHOPS ACTS. 37 visits were made to shops in connection with Shops Acts, and 12 infringements were rectified. 19 . GENERAL . The. foregoing report indicates a marked improvement on the record of sanitary administration in the Borough in 1940. This is attributable to two causes - (1) sufficient staff, (2) the lull in enemy action,. Factories received special attention in view, of their war time expansion and much useful work was accomplished. Inspections of milk and food supplies were also concentrated upon with good effect. Destruction and disinfection of infected or infested bedding, wearing apparel, etc. again reached peace time level, and much time was spent in giving help and advice following cases of Scabies and vermin. Further depletion of staff is expected owing to H.M. Service Registrations, and to temporary assistants seeking permanent posts; if this occurs, the good record of this year must inevitably decline, The staff (of whom only three are permanent employees) has given unstinted and loyal service through a very busy year-, and each one has given useful help and much time to Rehousing and Billeting work, Food Treatment Squad training, and other Civil Defence work, for which I am responsible. To-the Medical Officer of Health, Chief Off icera. and members, of the Corporation, I give thanks for their help and advice. I am, Ladies and GontTonio'n, •Your . obedient Servant, GEOFFREY McCLELLAND, Chief Sanitary Inspector., 20.
