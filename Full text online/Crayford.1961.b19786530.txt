I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1961 which has been prepared on the lines set out in Circular 1/62 of the Ministry of Health The Registrar General’s estimate of the mid-year population is 31,290 (30,920 in 1960) The vital statistics supplied annually by the General Register Office indicate that the general trend of the health of the Urban District remains satisfactory. The standardised death rate was 10.58 per 1.000 of the home population (11 01 in 1960) compared with 12 0 per 1.000 for England and Wales The standardised birth rate was 17.18 per 1.000 home population (16 16 in 1960) compared with a rate of 17 4 per 1.000 for the country as a whole The number of infants who died during the first year of life was 13 (14 in 1960) giving an infant mortality rate of 22 73 per 1.000 live births (26.6 in 1960) compared with 21 6 per 1.000 for England and Wales. During the year there was no maternal death associated with childbirth For the twelfth year in succession there has been no case of diphtheria in the Urban District There is no evidence. however. from the fatality rate of cases occurring in other parts of the country that there has been any waning of the virulence of this disease and. despite the good record of the area immunisation against this disease remains a matter of great importance No case of poliomyelitis occurred in the district during 1961 The availability of the Sabin oral vaccine and the fall co-operation of the public in accepting vaccination for all priority groups could well ensure a high degree of freedom from this disease in the years to come During 1961 there were 14 deaths from cancer of the lung in the Urban District (15 in 1960) It has become a duty to re iterate the proven association between this disease and heavy cigarette smoking and indeed with atmospheric pollution in general, The recent report of the Royal College of Physicians on Smoking and Health has brought this matter to the forefront as one of the outstanding public health problems of the day and some beneficial results may already be discerned One example of this is the agreement which has been reached between the Independent Television Authority and the tobacco industry to secure modifications that will include the avoidance of those aspects of advertising which make a special appeal to young people, The smoking habit is so deeply ingrained as to appear almost ineradicable but nevertheless the issue must be kept alive by all who are responsible for the education and health of the younger generation. 2 The report has drawn attention to the smoking habits of schoolchildren as ascertained in numerous surveys. It is stated that, in general, 11% to 15% of boys are already smoking small numbers of cigarettes by the age of 10 years. Girls smoke less often but, by the age of 15 years, about 15% smoke regularly. There is no reason to believe from such information as is available locally that these figures would not apply to this area. The Health Committee are giving much attention to methods of counteracting this disturbing trend but the issue is a very complex one. involving both short-term and long-term planning and much more is to be gained from example than from mere exhortation and the display of posters, important as these may be. A special responsibility rests not only on parents but on teachers. doctors and youth leaders generally to demonstrate, clearly, that they take the subject seriously by refraining, as far as possible, from cigarette smoking in the presence of young people. A degree of personal hardship may, therefore, be inevitable if there is to be any chance of success of impressing upon children that we are really in earnest. During the year 52 deaths were attributed to disease of the coronary arteries and angina pectoris, this being the largest number ever recorded in the area in any one yean This disease has increased in all western countries since World War I and, despite an enormous amount of research into the causes of this phenomenon, very little new information has emerged„ It is likely, however, that a number of factors associated with our modern civilisation operate together to form a pattern of living which tends towards the production of this disease,, Overeating generally and, particularly, a diet with a high animal fat content, sedentary habits with lack of regular exercise, oversmoking and hereditary factors have all been blamed, probably with good cause, but the exact mechanism that brings about the coronary accident remains hidden. Can there be much doubt, however, that coronary thrombosis is part of the price we pay for the high standard of living which we now enjoy? The long awaited report on the fluoridation of water supplies in relation to dental disease has now been published by H.M. Stationery Office. Striking confirmation is contained therein that the addition of fluoride to the public water supply to the extent of one part per million would bring about a substantial improvement in the teeth of young children,, More will be heard of this matter in the future and, notwithstanding the controversial nature of the proposal, it is to be hoped that the report will result in practical measures being taken to implement its recommendations. The report is of particular importance to this area where the water supply is practically devoid of natural fluoride. The Home Safety Act, 1961, empowers the councils of county districts to promote home safety by giving information and advice on the prevention of accidents in the home but county councils have, for many years, had this power under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946. Since 1959, the Kent County Council have made a grant to the Bexley, Erith and Crayford Home Safety Committee, through the councils concerned, which has facilitated this 3 work in recent years The new Act will enable the three authorities to deter mine more fully the future development of this important aspect of health education and the decision to appoint a part time Home Safety Organiser to work under the Medical Officer of Health will it is hoped result in a more sustained and effective campaign against accidents in the home than has been possible heretofore A Speakers Training Day was held on May 5th 1961 during a fortnight of intensive home safety propaganda. During the year the Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed the Council's Smoke Control Order No 1 in respect of the area north east of the railway line at Slade Green with the modification that the Order should come into operation on 1st December 1961 in lieu of the 1st November as proposed by the Council Although good progress was made in the installation of approved appliances and the adaptation of others it became necessary to apply to the Minister for a deferment of the appointed day to 1st April 1962 to which the Minister agreed The Crayford No 1 Order is now in operation and good progress is being made with the detailed survey in regard to Smoke Control Order No 2 which covers the area bounded on the east by Smoke Control Area No 1 on the north and west by the boundary between this district and the Boroughs of Erith and Bexley respectively and on the south by the British Railways line to Barnehurst The time is rapidly approaching when the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Government in the Greater London Area will bring about a major change in the local administration of the health and welfare services Much thought and energy will be required to meet both the challenge and the opportunity which lie ahead. In conclusion, I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement and the Chief Public Health Inspector Chief Clerk and all members of the Health Department for the good work which has been done during the year. I am Your obedient Servant JOHN LANDON Medical Officer of Health 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (in acres) 2.698.71 Population (Registrar General’s estimate mid year 1961) 31.290 Number of inhabited houses 9.623 Rateable value £482.345 Sum represented by a penny rate £1.980 Live Births Total M F Legitimate 555 278 277 Illegitimate17 7 10 572 285 287 Birth rate per 1.000 of the estimated home population - 18.28 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births - 3.06% General birth rate for England and Wales - 17.4 Stillbirths Total M F Legitimate 6 5 1 Illegitimate 6 5 1 Rate per 1.000 total (live and still) births - 10 38 Total M P Deaths 251 144 107 Death rate per 1, 000 of the estimated resident population - 8.02 General death rate for England and Wales - 12.0 5 The Birth Rate and Death Rate for Crayford compares favourably with that for other parts of the country The Registrar General has supplied comparability factors for 1961 The standardised Birth Rate which allows for comparison with other parts of the country is 17 18 and the standardised Death Rate is 10 58 Maternal Deaths There were no maternal deaths in 1961 Deaths of infants under one year of age Total M F Legitimate 13 6 7 Illegitimate 13 6 7 Rate per 1.000 live births (Crayford) - 22.73 Rate per 1 000 legitimate live births - 23.42 Neo Natal mortality rate per 1.000 live births - 15 .7 Early Neo Natal mortality rate per 1.000 live births - 10.5 Perinatal mortality rate per 1.000 total (live and still) births - 20.97 General death rate of infants under 1 year of age for England and Wales - 21.6 Deaths from Various Causes Malignant Neoplasm (all ages) 54 Measles (all ages) Whooping Cough (all ages) Diarrhoea (under 2 years of age) 6 Vital Statistics during 1961 and previous years YEAR POPULATION LIVE BIRTHS DEATHS INFANT DEATHS No RATE No RATE No. RATE C.U.D C.

Bexley and Erith Councils was successfully made to the Woolwich Borough Council for the use of their disinfection facilities until further notice. Mortuary The Mortuary at Bexley is jointly used by the Boroughs of Bexley and Erith and the Urban District of Crayford. Owing to the non-availability of technical assistance for the pathologists, it was decided by H, M, Coroner to direct bodies early in April, 1960 to West Hill Hospital and the arrangement continued until 1st July, 1961, when the Bexley Mortuary reverted to normal operation. During the period 1st July to 31st December, 1981. 94 bodies were admitted to the Mortuary, post mortems being conducted in all cases, and inquests in 9 cases. Crayford’s figures were 14 bodies, 14 post mortems and 3 inquests.

Despite the introduction of the new Food Hygiene Regulations setting out details regarding smoking it is regretted that there are still a number of shopkeepers and street traders who apparently do not fully realise the dangers to the public of this practice, and the penalties involved The number of food premises in the area is as follows Bakers 4 Butchers 18 Grocers 57 Greengrocers 20 Confectioners 25 Fishmongers 8 Cafes„ Canteens etc, 35 Public Houses 19 Off Licences 3; Clubs 12; Other Premises 29 Under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 70 premises are registered for the storage and sale of Ice Cream and 35 for the manufacture or preparation of preserved food intended for sale Complaints The following complaints were received and dealt with during the year Potatoes,, Complaint was made regarding the condition of prepacked potatoes. The condition had been brought about by the poorness of the crop generally and the fact that this particular bag had possibly been in stock longer than it should have been, coupled with the fact that excessive rainfall at the time of lifting with consequent mechanical damage had reduced the time that it would normally have been possible to maintain the product in first class condition Contact was made with the suppliers but no further action was taken on receipt of their comments. 19 Sultanas, Alleged foreign matter In a packet of sultanas formed the basis of another complaint No action could be taken in this case owing to the inadequate proof that the matter complained of (a small stone resembling a sultana) was in fact present in the package when purchased Mllko There were three complaints regarding milk The first was in respect of the quality of cartoned milk from an automatic vending machine Enquiries were made of the suppliers, but owing to the length of time between the purchase and subsequent complaint the milk had become so sour and curdled that it was not possible to test for quality The second concerned the presence of a slug in a bottle of milk but, in this instance, it was difficult to establish that the slug had not entered the bottle at the customer s premises, despite extensive enquiries and laboratory tests to this end Thirdly the case of a bottle of milk containing foreign matter was ascertained to be the result of inadequate cleansing of dairy equipment and resulted in the suppliers being fined £10, with five guineas costs Evaporated Separated Milk and VegetabIe Fat„ Allegations of incorrect labelling and rancidity of this product were unfounded The Analyst confirmed that the product was normal and the composition consistent with the requirements of the Schedule to Skimmed Milk Bneado String found in a loaf of bread led to legal proceedings being taken with a consequent penalty to the bakers concerned, £30 with three guineas costs Pork Pie0 Mould in a pork pie was also the subject of legal proceedings and resulted in the supplier being fined £15 with five guineas costs Mineral Water0 No action was taken regarding a proprietry brand of mineral water.
