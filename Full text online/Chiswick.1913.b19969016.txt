CHIS 14 Urban District of Chiswick. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Chief Sanitary Inspector. 1913. JOHN H. CLARKE, M.R. San. I., Cert. R.I.P.H. &c. Chief Sanitary Inspector Urban District of Chiswick. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Chiswick, W. January, 1914. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Sir and Gentlemen, In compliance with the orders of the Local Government Board, I have the honour to submit for your consideration my twenty-second Annual Report upon the details of the work performed, either directly or under my supervision, in accordance with your instructions in connection with the Public Health Department, and under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health. Although a thorough organized system of house-tohouse inspection has been in vogue for over 20 years, and the utmost scope of the Public Health Acts afforded me by your generosity and confidence, —whereby the District has been brought under the most modern system of sanitation—the statistics appended with this Report shew that, with additions to the statutes year by year there are greater facilities for exercising our energies, and corresponding powers for dealing with nuisances and sanitary defects for the improvement of the health condition of the district, 4 The reports submitted to you month by month under the Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations have not deteriorated as regards the number and character of insanitary dwellings. The general nuisances also, which include yard paving, cleansing of houses, dustbins, drainage defects, etc., are always in evidence. The improved methods in dealing with houses under the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, suggested in the subsequent circular of the Local Government Board, by notifying Owners and others of the Council's intention to take more drastic steps, have met with good results, and excepting in a few cases where unforeseen difficulties have arisen, the Owners shew their willingness to comply with the Council's requirements, and give as little trouble as possible. In many cases where the houses have undergone extensive repairs and rebuilding of back additions and new roofs, it is gratifying to know that the tenants enjoy the advantages of a sound dwelling, including the improved methods of light and ventilation, also wash-houses and w.c.'s, and an abundant supply of water from the main. The number of inspections exclusive of general work, and made under the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, during the year were 2,967, as against 2,814 for 1912. As the statute and regulations thereunder place this work under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health, I have had the advantage of his advice and aid, which has been applied in such a 5 manner as to render the work a pleasure, and reduce difficulties to a minimum. A perusal of the Tables also shews that a very large number of rooms and houses have been reported to him for cleansing where the Medical Officer's certificate is a necessity to enforce a notice. Here again the owners generally comply with the first notice, and give very little trouble in this direction. House Drainage. In making a house-to-house inspection, or enquiries relating to infectious disease and general complaints, a large number of houses are " starred " for drain testing. Comparatively few drains have been reconstructed throughout, having regard to the large number in the district, but the smoke test, which is the test usually applied, has revealed a large number of leakages in the branch connections, soilpipes and w.c's, at a point near the surface, or where drain air can easily escape with baneful results. Inspection chambers, fresh air inlets, etc., also receive attention, and where defective are brought up-to-date ; and finally the yards, or portions thereof are paved from the dwellings outwards, or to a gully, and thus the drains are rendered sound, and well ventilated, surface water is carried off, and the houses rendered sanitary and dry. During the year 216 house drains were examined and tested as against 285 for the previous year. Perhaps fewer representations have been made to the Council with regard to systems of combined drainage, which is accounted for by the fact that the 6 leakages discovered have been localised, the actual condition of the main drain being known, and the defects in the branch connections remedied without further trouble. The absence of efficient damp courses create a great difficulty in a very large number of cases, and involves considerable expense to underpin, and lay in a good horizontal damp course, which is really the only effectual remedy, although in some cases a vertical damp course with additional floor ventilation is tried, but is seldom satisfactory. It is not an uncommon occurrence to find the main walls of a house extensively saturated to an alarming extent by capillary attraction, sometimes caused through carelessness in neglecting to remedy a defective rainwater pipe, but more often from the absence of a damp course. This gives rise to considerable difficulty and is the most costly to deal with. Water Supply. Although implicit instructions are given to Inspectors with regard to the water supply of districts, our difficulties thereunder are reduced to a minimum, having regard to the method of supply. Waste of water, however, is specially mentioned as a part of our duty, and whenever such is discovered the Metropolitan Water Board is immediately notified, and defects are promptly attended to before much damage is done. The extension of the house supply to other tenements, especially where an additional sink is needed, has received due attention, and in many cases demanded. 7 Cisterns as a source of supply are now practically a thing of the past in the district, although until comparatively recent years no other source was available. Disinfections. The disinfection of rooms, bedding, clothing, etc., are carried out under the order of the Medical Officer of Health, and are referred to in the County Tables. Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. A large number of inspections and enquiries have been made during the year in addition to the details given in my special report, submitted in the month of December. A perusal of this table reveals the actual number of Factories, Workshops and Workplaces in the district, compiled after careful inspection for a report required by statutory power to be submitted to the Medical Officer of Health. Every facility for inspection has been given me by the various occupiers who readily comply, as far as possible, with the requirements of the Act, or by the direct request of the Home Office. Prompt attention has been given to Outworkers, and new workshops were duly notified to the Home Office Inspector. The following is a list of trades represented:— FACTORIES. Trades represented.

They have been regularly inspected during the year, and compliance with the Regulations strictly adhered to. Careful attention has also been given to the shops where foodstuffs are prepared and sold, in addition to the registered premises already alluded to. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The small number of samples submitted to the Public Analyst is due to the fact of the alacrity of the County Authorities and the satisfactory high standard of foodstuffs. In a few cases only, upon complaint or observation, informal samples are taken, and if the adulteration is detected, official samples resulting in contravention of the Act form a subject of complaint to the Bench. The following samples were taken:— New Milk 17 Skim Milk 1 Butter 13 Total 31 Proceedings were instituted in two cases only. 16 TABLE II. CHISWICK URBAN DISTRICT.

ANNUAL REPORT of the School Medical Officer for the YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31st, 1913. 1913. URBAN DISTRICT OF CHISWICK. Education (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1907. Report on the Medical Inspection of Elementary School Children for Year Ended Dec. 31st, 1913. To the Chairman and Members of the Education Committee. Mrs. Corrie Grant and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my first annual report on the medical inspection of school children. It may be well at the outset to summarise briefly the requirements of the Board of Education and the changes that have occurred, or are to occur in the near future. The Education (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1907, in so far as it concerns the medical inspection of school children, was the outcome of evidence which showed that there was a great deal of physical unfitness in certain classes of the population, which might be ameliorated or prevented. Local authorities therefore were obliged to provide for the medical inspection of elementary school children at certain times during their school life, and they were also given the power to attend to the health and physical condition of these children. This came into force in January, 1908, and at first it was intended that examinations should be made 6 At present the teacher's rooms or class rooms are used, while in the summer I have done eye testing in the playgrounds. Appliances for weighing and measuring the children have been provided, and the results of the inspections are noted on cards, each child having a separate card, which can be readily referred to when necessary. When parents are present and defects are found in a child, it is easy to bring the defect prominently before the parent and give reasons why it should be remedied. On the other hand, if parents are not present, it is necessary to send a printed notice, but the effect is not the same. I have had cards printed for the most common defects and I have had numerous enquiries at the office after these had been sent, but it will be seen from figures on a later page that a good many defects are not remedied. This is especially the case in young children, as the mothers have the idea that " they will grow out of everything."To follow up such cases properly, it is necessary to have the services of a tactful nurse or visitor, who would be able to visit the home and have a quiet chat with the mother. At present there is no such school nurse in this district. A great deal of work in connection with these inspections has been done by the head teachers, and I should like to express my thanks to them for their very willing help at all times during the year. The age of the children affects the time expended in the work, because when 7 children aged 8 or over are examined, it is necessary to test the vision and this reduces the number inspected in any given time Generally speaking 8 to 10 children are examined in one hour. The schools in the district consist of nine departments, Belmont and Strand on-the-Green being schools containing boys', girls', and infants' departments, while Hogarth Boys', Hogarth Girls' and GlebeStreet Infants' are practically separate schools. All the above are Council Schools and most of the Roman Catholic children of the district attend a school in Acton. The accommodation in the various departments is as follows Hogarth Boys 872 Hogarth Girls 948 Glebe Infants 651 Belmont Boys 354 Belmont Girls 354 Belmont Infants 396 Strand Boys 420 Strand Girls 336 Strand Infants 357 Total 4688 I have mentioned that the Medical Inspection year is from April 1st —March 31st, but this report includes the work for the year ended Dec. 31st, 1913. During this period 1,316 children have been examined—662boys and 654 girls. 14 There will always be however, a certain class who find it difficult out of the small wages coming into the house to provide for the necessary train or bus fares to the hospital, and the small charge for glasses when prescribed. I have found many cases of this description. Tonsils and Adenoids. A large number of children were found to be suffering from enlarged Tonsils and Adenoids. About 50 per cent. of the children re-examined had had these defects remedied by operation. It is interesting to note that I found at the first examinations 80 children who had already had the operation performed. This is, I think, one result of the medical inspections in previous years. Parents have got to know of this trouble in children and seek advice even before the children are examined at school. In the case of children with these defects, a card is given or sent to parents showing the after-effects of the obstructed breathing caused by Adenoids, etc. External Eye Diseases. Practically all the cases of defects in this class of disease were cases of Strabismus (Squint). It is very satisfactory to find that there are so few cases of inflammatory conditions of the eye which are contagious. Tuberculosis. Very few cases of this disease were discovered during the inspections. Cases of this disease which have been notified to me as Medical Officer of Health are of 15 •course excluded from school. During the year 27 cases of Tuberculosis of all kinds were notified among children of school age. All have been visited and in some cases where advisable the children have been sent away to Homes or Sanatoria. Of the 27 cases mentioned twelve were cases of of Tuberculosis of Lungs. Infectious and Contagious Diseases. Not many of these diseases were seen at the routine inspections, probably because during the year I have seen a large number of children at the office. The teachers have been asked to send any doubtful cases to me, so that they may be excluded if necessary. During the year 227 certificates have been given for exclusion from, and re-admission to school. This system of seeing children at the office is practically what may be termed an Inspection Clinic. The Board of Education recommend that this system should be adopted, and it is certainly very useful, ft is most desirable that children who have been absent from school for any period, suffering, or supposed to be suffering from an infectious or contagious disease should be examined in order that they may be certified free from infection. The clinic should still further be extended to include the examination of children who are absent from school for say a week without a doctor's certificate. In many cases illness might be discovered which was not being attended to properly, and which might be infecting others in the same house or neighbourhood. 22 TABLE V. Children aged 7 and 8 year.
