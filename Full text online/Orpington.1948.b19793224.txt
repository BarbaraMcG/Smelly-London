Madam and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting to you the Annual Report for the year 1948, this being my first report to you and the fourteenth Annual Report since Orpington was made an Urban District in 1934. I commenced my duties as your Medical Officer of Health on the 1st August last, following the retirement of Dr. P. N. Cave, who for so many years gave to your Local Authority the outstanding skill and knowledge which he possessed. Much of the work which he developed during his term of office was, on 5th July, transferred to the administration of the County Council under the terms of the Health Act, 1946. This change of administration, both at officer and Local Authority levels, has made it difficult for me to submit a report on the work of the Department during 1948. I have, however, indicated in the body of the report a summary of the services now given by the County scheme through their divisional administration insofar as it affects the inhabitants in your district. Where there is over-centralisation and a multiplicity of authorities dealing with Public Health, there is a danger of loss of local interest, incentive and enthusiasm. It is because of this danger that one must appreciate the fact that, in spite of losing many of the functions previously performed by your Local Authority, there remains a field of work in Public Health which has not yet been cultivated. Public Health is not merely a matter of treatment and care of illness, nor a matter wholly of drains and effluvia, but extends into the whole field of social welfare. The fact that there is an inter-relationship between active medicine, the prevention of disease, the improvement to the environment and the social condition of the people, is something that we, as a Public Health Authority, must always keep before us. There are two outstanding matters which require attention : (1) There are 2,786 houses without main drainage and 271 houses without piped water supply. These are a potential danger to Public Health, and should receive first priority at all Government levels. (2) Improvement in the standard of food preparation. At the end of the year Mr. Crowe and the Sanitary Inspectors began a detailed inspection of all food-preparing places, canteens, kitchens, etc., and it is hoped that in my next Annual Report I shall be able to report more fully on the matter. This is important, for not only is community feeding a common 3 practice to-day, but it follows that where large numbers are partaking of a meal there is greater danger of spread of infection should that meal be contaminated. The vital statistics for the year show that the district continues to increase in population, and is likely to do so for many years to come. The development of a large housing estate in St. Paul's Cray will bring with it certain Public Health problems associated with a large influx of people into an already established community. The birth rate shows a fall, which is common over the rest of the country. This is the usual fall following a high birth rate subsequent to war. The death rate shows a slight decrease, being 8.4 per 1,000 population, as compared with 8.6 per 1,000 population in the previous year. The Infantile Mortality rate is low, and is the lowest on record. The Infectious Diseases showed nothing of note, the rate of notifiable infectious diseases being 15 per 1,000 population. By far the greatest numbers were those of Measles and Whooping Cough. Mr. Capon, your Chief Sanitary Inspector for so many years, retired in August, and was succeeded by Mr. Crowe, on whom so much of the responsibility for the efficient day-to-day working of the Department now depends, and to whose enthusiasm and co-operation I should like to pay all due tribute. I have, for convenience, sub-divided the report into various sections: Section A. Social Conditions of the Area, including Vital Statistics. „ B. Summary of Health Services. „ C. Sanitary and Environmental Circumstances. „ D. Housing. E. Food Protection. „ F. Infectious Diseases. „ G. Other Services of the Health Department. If I may be allowed to add a personal note, I should like to record my appreciation of the help I received from Dr. Cave on taking over his duties, and from the Clerk, officers and Committee, and to say how much I have been impressed with the efficiency which is general throughout. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, K. E. TAPPER, Medical Officer of Health. 4 SECTION A. SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Orpington was made an Urban District of 20.842 acres in 1934, and since that date has developed rapidly from a 33,000 population to a 58,320 population in 1948. The northern part of the district is urban in character ; the southern largely rural. Light industries have developed in the St. Mary Cray Ward. There are now some 165 factories of various characters within the district. The south-eastern boundary of the district is defined by a ridge of the North Downs, and the northern boundary by the main railway line to the N.E. Kent Coast, the area being divided into four main water sheds, all draining towards the north. The administrative centre, with a civic hall for 480 persons, is situated close to the Orpington Railway Station, within easy access of the main populated areas, and readily accessible by bus service from the outlying districts. The Council maintains twelve parks and recreation grounds of some 175 acres; 1,383 acres have been purchased jointly by the L.C.C. and K.C.C. as part of the Green Belt land, the major portion being leased to and managed by the Orpington Council.

The Registrar General gives the population at mid-year 1948 as 58,320, which is equivalent to 2.8 persons per acre. The progressive increase in population since urbanisation brings with it responsibilities in Local Government administration, responsibilities which the Local Authority is meeting with success. It is now some 18 years since the last census was taken, and it is not possible, with any accuracy, to give those details of population which a census provides, and which are so important in dealing with social medicine. It may be argued that application of vital statistics to a comparatively small population is of little value. It is only by applying these statistics to unit populations that one is able to discover the good and bad areas. It is in such fields that the Medical Officer of Health, with staff, and access to all records of all social health services, has a scope of work which would offer a needful field of research. The proportional increase in the numbers of aged persons has brought with it new problems, which are now receiving the attention of those authorities responsible for the care of such persons. Geriatrics promises much towards alleviating this problem of the care and treatment of the aged ; but, before one can apply social medicine to the care of the aged, one must have a knowledge of the vital statistics and the conditions under which the aged are living. I am giving a tabulation of the distribution of population in wards, with an indication of the density in each ward. This is self-explanatory. It is a pity that until such time as a census can be taken, I am unable to give the age grouping in each ward. ft This again is of importance when applying social health services. Ward Acreage Population Persons per acre Biggin Hill 2,411.20 3,426 1.4 Chelsfield 1,227.26 627 0.5 Crofton North 422.64 4,254 10.0 Crofton South 883.22 5,810 6.6 Cudham 2,057.08 999 0.5 Downe 1,661.00 946 0.5 Farnborough 1,283.66 3,962 3.0 Goddington North 482.73 4,607 9.5 Goddington South 684.83 4,366 6.4 Green Street Green 2,169.48 6,385 3.0 Knockholt 2,497.10 1,148 0.5 Knoll 483.13 5,271 10.9 Leaves Green 1,909.54 591 0.3 Petts Wood 482.53 6,960 14.4 Poverest 279.49 4,762 17.0 St. Mary Cray 1.907.14 4,736 2.5 20,842.03 58,850 Births. The rate of 16.3 per 1,000 population is given by the Registrar General, which shows a fall compared with recent years. The average yearly birth rate since 1934 is 19 per 1,000 population, so that this year's rate compares unfavourably with pre-war years. In the first few years following a war the birth rate rises, and the indication for 1948 shows that a fall may now be expected. In Orpington, however, the birth rate does not fluctuate abnormally from year to year. The excess of births over deaths was 461. The births actually occurring in Orpington reach a high figure, because of Farnborough Hospital with its large maternity section, thus requiring a large outward transfer list before one is able to calculate the true birth rate. Births occurring in Nursing Homes in the district totalled 25, while those occurring at home, and attended by doctor or midwife, are not available to me. Illegitimate Births. The illegitimate rate (per 1,000 births) for 1948 was 42. This rate varies from year to year. The average rate over the 14 years from 1934 was 45 per 1,000 births, and for the six years 1936-1941 the average yearly rate was 38, rising to 52 for the six years 1942-1947, 7 Stillbirths. Twenty-four stillbirths during the year gives a yearly rate per 1,000 births of 25. There has been some reduction in this rate compared with pre-war years, the average rate in 1936-1941 being 30.3, while in 1942-1947 the rate was 25.5. An abnormally high rate in the year 1934 makes the average yearly rate for the past 14 years 29 per 1,000 births. These are not satisfactory figures. Deaths. Four hundred and ninety-three deaths in 1948 gives a death rate of 8.4 per 1,000 population. This compares not unfavourably with the previous year—8.6, and is below the average rate for the past 14 years—9.9 per cent. A tabulation of the main causes of death is here given. The ages at death show '26 per cent, were 75 years and over. Causes. Cancer 103 Heart and Circulatory Diseases 199 Respiratory (non T.B.) 39 Tuberculosis 18 Infectious Diseases 7 Digestive Diseases 22 Accident 18 Suicide 8 Other Causes 79 493 Infant Deaths. Nineteen infants died under 1 year of age, giving an Infant Mortality Rate of 19.9 per 1,000 live births. To apply preventive action against infant deaths, one requires a full knowledge of the circumstances of the family, and the full medical and environmental details. Under the divorcement of Maternity and Child Welfare services from the services of the Local District Council, it is not practicable to apply to Orpington any research into the causes and prevention of infant deaths. The average infant mortality rate for Orpington since 1934 is 37 per 1,000 births, so that the rate for 1948 is very satisfactory. The fact that it is the lowest rate on Orpington's record is to the credit of the parentcraft of the inhabitants, but it must not be overlooked that some 24 babies were born dead, and are not recorded in the calculation of infant mortality. Maternal Mortality. The Maternal Mortality Rate is happily again low, only one mother dying in childbirth, and compares with a rate of 2.7 for the previous year. 8 SECTION B. SUMMARY OF HEALTH SERVICES. It is difficult to define where health services begin and end. I do not like the present-day classification of Health Services and Public Health Services, which only leads to confusion. The former is in the main a treatment service. I am not in my own mind satisfied that medical treatment plays a major part in the promotion of health. The social factors are of more importance ; for example, the provision of houses and homes by the District Council has a real effect on health, as has an adequate food supply, the cleansing of streets, the removal and disposal of refuse, proper drainage and sewerage, a supply of pure water, and sundry other services, only some of which are the responsibility of the Council. In the following paragraphs I do not attempt to place any one service in priority over the others, nor to give details of the year's work performed, but merely a statement of the facilities and services provided for treatment and prevention of disease and for promotion of health. 1. Health Services Rendered by the Council. Such services as immunisation against diphtheria—which were well advanced in Orpington—and the visiting of homes for infectious disease, T.B., etc., by Health Visitors, ceased to be exercised by your Council on 5th July, 1948. Sanitary and Environmental Services. I have reported on these services later in the report under Sections C, D, E. F and G. These are the major services of your Health Department. A summary of the year's work is in the Appendices. Inspection of Nursing Homes. This is a delegated service. The two Nursing Homes in the area provide accommodation as follows: Number of Maternity beds 15 „ „ Other beds 3 Patients received during the year 34 These Homes were inspected on 3 occasions during the year. There were no infringements of the local Bye-laws, and it will be noticed from the above statistics that full use of the beds provided was not made. 9 2. Services Rendered by Hospital Boards. There are two main hospitals situated in Orpington—Farnborough Hospital, with 828 beds, and Orpington Hospital, with 1,063 beds. 3. Services Rendered by the County Council. The following services are provided by the County Council, and supervised through the Area No. 7 Sub-Committee, upon which Orpington has three Council representatives. I am unable to give details of these services rendered to the Orpington inhabitants, as all statistics are centralised at Maidstone, and Orpington records are incorporated in the figures for Area 7 as a whole. Health Visiting. There are nine Health Visitors employed by the Kent County Council and carrying out their duties in the Orpington district. Their function is to give advice on the care of young children and to expectant and nursing mothers, and also to undertake duties in connection with the School Health Services, immunisation, vaccination and other ancillary services. Their local headquarters is situated at Downe House, High Street, Orpington. Midwifery (Domiciliary). There are three Midwives engaged in wholly domiciliary midwifery, and three others who are combined Midwives and Home Nurses. Their services are engaged direct by the patient, or through the patient's private doctor. They act either as midwives or maternity nurses. Home Nursing Service. This service, which under the National Health Act became free on the 5th July, 1948, provides trained nurses for patients who require nursing in their own homes. A night service is not at present available, and the service is provided on medical certification only. There are five Home Nurses in the Orpington area, plus three who combine Home Nursing with Domiciliary Midwifery. Domestic Help Service. Number of part-time helpers employed 44 Number of cases assisted during 1948 251 10 Child Welfare Centres. CHELSFIELD Reading Room 1st, 3rd and 5th Tuesdays in month—afternoon.

Dental clinics are also held in the country areas—Farnborough. Cudham, Westerham, Biggin Hill, Downe, Green Street Green, Knockholt, etc. 11 Immunisation and Vaccination. This is carried out at the Child Welfare Centres as listed above, and in addition, by special appointment, at Downe House, High Street, Orpington, on Wednesday afternoons. Ambulance Service. There is an ambulance depot at Farnborough Hospital, where there are seven ambulances and two sitting-case cars. Laboratory Service. Farnborough Hospital, with whom there is close co-operation in matters of urgency, provides a full laboratory service. Routine medical specimens are done by Maidstone Laboratory, and also samples of milk and foods. Day Nurseries. There is a Day Nursery at Scad's Hill House, Orpington, with accommodation for approximately 75 children under five years of age. Specialist Clinics. Ear, Nose and Throat: Farnborough Hospital. Ophthalmic : School House, Chislehurst Road. Orthopaedic : Orpington Hospital. Speech Defects : School House, Chislehurst Road. Medical Loan Depot. Arrangements have been made with the British Red Cross Society for the continuation of the Medical Loan Depots. The full range of nursing requisites is available at these depots, which are additional to the loan cupboards kept by Home Nurses. Applications for loans of such equipment for Orpington inhabitants should be made to Mrs. James, 39, Willett Way, Petts Wood. 12 SECTION C. SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES. WATER. I am indebted to the Deputy Director of Water Examination Metropolitan Water Board for the details which follow. The water supply is that provided by the Metropolitan Water Board, and has been an adequate and pure supply at all times during 1948, being derived from 9 wells, namely : Orpington, North Orpington, Jewels Wood, West Wickham, Sundridge, Shortlands, Honor Oak, Eynsford and Bexley. Bacteriological analyses of these wells are made five times a week, and consistently satisfactory results have been obtained. Chemical analyses of well supplies are also made at regular intervals. (See Appendix for summary of Analyses.) All supplies are treated with chlorine on the works, but any excess remaining after a period of contact is removed completely or reduced to an amount that will not be perceptible to the consumers. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine before being restored to supply, and samples of water from them are analysed to establish that the water in them is up to the normal standard of water in the distribution system. None of the supplies is plumbo-solvent. There are isolated parts of the district without piped water supply, 271 houses being dependent upon underground tanks or well water. Samples taken from this type of supply proved satisfactory of their kind, but only suitable in the absence of a piped supply. During the year 82 houses, previously dependent upon stored rain water, were connected to the water mains. The Council are proceeding with the scheme for financial aid to householders to assist them in the expenses of connection to the main water supply. The Metropolitan Water Board completed extensions to the water mains during the year. Drainage. Main drainage throughout Orpington is the responsibility of the West Kent Main Sewerage Board. The Engineer has given me the following figures of extensions of seweraee during 1948 ; 13 (a) CHELSFIELD MAIN DRAINAGE. Outfall Sewer 202 ft. 9 in. dia. Julian Road 1,104 ft. 9 in. dia. Worlds End Lane 1.272 ft. 6 in. dia. Church Road 4,627 ft. 9 in. dia. (b) TEMPORARY S.W. SEWER. CRAY AVENUE. 224 ft. 21 in. dm. connector pipe. 690 ft. 30 in. dia. „ „ (c) EXTENSION OF SOIL SEWER, STAR LANE. 340 ft. 4 in. dia. Cesspools. At the end of the year there were 2,571 houses draining to 2,151 cesspools and 215 with pail closets. This high number of cesspools is mainly due to the rural type of the southern part of the district, where the extension of sewers is impracticable. The following is an analysis of the cesspools in the area : Cesspools abolished and connections made to sewer 48 Number of cesspools at end of year 2,151 Number of houses with cesspools where sewer is available 560 Number where sewer is not at present available 1,591 2,151 Of these, Cesspools on line of projected new sewers 357 Cesspools in unsewered private streets 480 The Council has a scheme for cesspool emptying which is a charge upon the owner/occupier. Briefly this is : Where sewer is available the charge per load of 750 gallons is 14s., and where sewer is not available the charge is 5s. per load. The number of cesspools abolished and the premises connected to a sewer in the years 1946, 1947 and 1948 were as follows : 1946 .... 18 1947 .... 25 1948 .... 48 The number of premises erected in 1948 with cesspools was 23. Rivers and Streams. There are two, the rivers Cray and Kidbrook, both of which come under regular supervision. Four inspections were made in 1948, and analyses made of the water, which proved satisfactory. Swimming Baths. There is one Swimming Bath in the district to which the public are admitted, and samples were taken from this bath and also from the Scouts' Swimming Pool at the camping ground at Downe. Apart from over-chlorination in one case, the analyses were satisfactory. 14 Factories and Workshops. A close relationship is kept between the Sanitary Inspectors and the Factories' Act Inspector. Three notices issued under the Factories' Act called for action by the Local Authority, and were all complied with. There are in all 165 factories in the district, mainly situated in the Cray Valley, and these are mostly light industries. It was not possible, during the period of the war, to maintain the routine work applicable to the 1937 Factories' Act, which was designed to improve hygienic conditions in factories and workshops. There is, therefore, an accumulated amount of work still to be done. Appendix 4 shows tabulation of Inspections and Defects. Outworkers. No lists of outworkers were received from the occupiers of factories in the Urban District during the year. Smoke Abatement. Five hundred and thirty-three observations have been made during 1948, and reports have been submitted thereon. The Council installed in September a deposit gauge at St. Mary Cray, and a monthly analysis is kept. The average monthly amount of solids collected during the period September/December, 1948, was equivalent to a deposit of 16J tons per square mile. The month to month fluctuations in deposited matter are often the result of variations in weather, and a long period of observation, preferably five years, is needed before reliable conclusions can be drawn about the average level of atmospheric pollution in the district, or about the rate at which it is being produced. There is, however, evidence of nuisances arising from factory effluvia, a matter which is under active consideration by the Local Authority. Shops Acts. In 1948 not all of the Inspectors were Shops Acts Inspectors. Seventy inspections were made, but there were no serious irregularities. A summary of the work of the Shops Acts Inspectors shows the following : Inspections 70 Absence of Statutory Forms 2 Ventilation Defects 1 Inadequacy of Sanitary Conveniences 1 Inadequacy of Washing Accommodation 4 15 Cleansing of Persons. A Cleansing Unit is established at Downe House, High Street, Orpington, for the treatment of scabies and for the cleansing of verminous persons. Number of persons cleansed during 1948 3 Number of persons treated for scabies 46 There were 18 complaints of dirty premises, which called for action by the Sanitary Inspectors. In all cases disinfestation was carried out. Sanitary Inspection of Area. The whole district comes under surveillance by the Sanitary Inspectors, either by routine visiting or in the following up of complaints. A detailed summary of the work in the area during the year is shown in the Appendix, from which I have extracted the following figures : HOUSING. Number of Inspections 2,386 Number of Premises in which defects were found 979 INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Number of Inspections 143 FOOD PREMISES. Number of Inspections 697 Number of Premises in which defects were found 29 FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. Number of Inspections 111 Number of Factories in which defects were found 8 SAMPLING. Total number of samples taken—379, as follows: Food and Drugs Act 210 Designated Milks 75 Mixed Milk 2 Ice Cream 34 Water 58 TRADE PREMISES. Number of Inspections 693 Number of Premises in which defects were found 45 16 Rodent Control. Activity in this work continued throughout the year. The comprehensive treatment of sewers was carried out with the cooperation of the Engineer. Good results were obtained by the method of treatment recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The following statistics are of work carried out following complaints and by routine investigation : No. of Infested Premises Inspections Found Cleared Refuse Tips 30 1 1 Other Council Premises 341 45 45 Trade Premises 185 35 20 Private Premises 3,539 211 110 Public Cleansing and Refuse Collection and Disposal. Mr. Crowe, the Chief Sanitary Inspector, is also the Cleansing Superintendent, and I have included his report, as follows : House refuse is collected weekly in the district, with the exception of the rural part of the area, which receives a fortnightly service. The Council has not undertaken the collection of trade refuse, but shopkeepers are allowed to take their trade refuse (mainly food tins) to the disposal dump on payment of a small fee. Seven self-contained all steel or metal lined side-loading refuse collecting vehicles with sliding covers are owned by the Council, and one of similar type is hired for use in the rural part of the district. Three teams of collectors operate in the northern area, each with two vehicles, and a relay system is worked so that there is no waste of collectors' time. One vehicle (hired) is used for the rural areas. In addition, three salvage vehicles are in use, one for the collection of salvage from shops, one for the collection of pig food, and another for general purposes. The method of disposal of the refuse is by controlled tipping, which is carried out at Downe, the average distance of haulage being four miles. The site was first used in 1940, and, having regard to the possibilities of extension, it is estimated that the site will be available for at least another ten years. Salvage is dealt with at the Salvage Depot, Crofton Pound Hill, Orpington, where paper and rags are pressed and baled, and bottles, metal and bones are stored prior to being sold. 1? Pig food is collected from the communal street bins on alternate days, and from food shops and canteens, etc., daily, and is delivered to a pig keeper at the end of each day's collection. During the year 1,025 tons of salvage of all kinds were sold for £5,676, as compared with 920 tons for £4,899 in 1947. Full details regarding the salvage sales for 1948 are as follows : T. C.

HOUSING. The responsibility of the Local Authority is not only one of re-housing, but also of seeing that private dwellings are kept in a reasonable state of repair, and, where necessary, of enforcing statutory action where nuisances or defects exist. The latter duty is placed upon the Health Department, and to-day is one of complexity, in that during the war years repairs were naturally held in abeyance. The post-war years, with shortage of labour and materials, are still difficult. It has not been practicable to carry out house-to-house district inspection, which was a routine in pre-war years. I have extracted the following statement from the Appendix, which gives details of the work carried out during 1948 : Number of premises inspected 979 Number of visits in connection therewith 2,386 Number of premises where defects found 419 Number of premises rendered fit as result of informal action 358 Number of premises rendered fit as result of formal action 25 Overcrowding. The abatement of overcrowding has not been possible owing to the general housing shortage which is common throughout the country, and in spite of all that Orpington has done in the matter of re-housing, many families are still without separate accommodation. The sharing of houses built for only one family brings with it social evils that affect the well-being of the inhabitants. The sharing of kitchens is not conducive to good-fellowship of the occupants, and this in turn leads to social insecurity. Re-Housing. The post-war re-housing by Orpington Council has placed them high on the list of efficient authorities, and the following statistics give a clear picture of the progress that has been made by the Authority. I am grateful to the Valuation and Estates Officer for these details. 19 Prior to 1943 During 1948 Total as at Dec., 1948 I. (a) No. of permanent dwellings built by the L.A. (excluding 402 old-type, pre-1939 Council houses) 100 449 555 (b) No. of prefabricated dwellings built by L.A 258 61 319 (c) No. of dwellings held under requisition by the L.A 301 — 275 II. (a) No. of families occupying I. (a) — — 566 (b) „ „ „ I. (b) — — 319 (c) „ „ „ I. (c) — — 359 (1,052 persons) III. Total No. of families rehoused during 1948 (a) 458 (b) 61 Total 519 293 persons have been admitted to Rest Centres during the year, and, taking an average of 3h per family, this represents approximately 84 families. In addition, approximately 40 other families have been accommodated in requisitioned property, making a total for the year of 124 families. IV. The number of families on the waiting list as at 31.12.48 was 3,227. V. It is not possible to give the number living in overcrowded conditions. As a result of the Ministry of Health's enquiry into the number of housing applicants, and the completion of individual forms, the number of applicants on Orpington's list is likely to be reduced by about 500. In addition to the above, 31 permanent houses were erected by private enterprise during 1948, and 111 war-damage rebuilds. 20 SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. With the present-day limitation of the supply of food, it is vitally important to see that the standard of foodstuffs is maintained at a high state of purity. The protection of food against human contamination is also vitally necessary, especially where community feeding is a common practice. It was because of these factors that a special enquiry and inspections were begun at the end of the year into all canteens, hotels, restaurants, etc., and it is hoped to be able to show in the following year's report the progress that has been made. It is, however, pleasing to note that there has been little food and drug adulteration during the year, and that there have been no outbreaks of food poisoning. The assistance given to us by the traders and retailers has been not only helpful, but very much appreciated by the officers. Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Two hundred and ten samples, as tabulated in the Appendix, were taken under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, 179 of them being informal and 31 formal. Only one (an informal sample of fish paste) was found to be inferior. It contained 60 per cent, of fish instead of 65 per cent., which is the legal minimum. Upon investigation, the deficiency was found to be due to imperfect mixing of the paste when in bulk. Inspection of Food Premises. There are approximately 270 premises dealing with the sale and handling of food. These call for routine inspection, and during the year 697 inspections were made, as follows : Butchers 87 Fishmongers and Poulterers 73 Grocers 227 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 84 Ice Cream Premises 46 Restaurants 80 Bakeries 64 Confectioners 36 MEAT INSPECTION. Slaughterhouses. There are 10 licensed slaughterhouses in the district, to which 69 visits were paid by the Meat Inspectors. Twelve slaughtermen were licensed under the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933. Under the food control regulations, no slaughtering other than pigs is carried out in the district. 21 Carcases Inspected and Condemned. Cattle excluding Cows - Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed (if known) — — — — 93 Number inspected — — — — 33 All diseases except T.B. Whole carcases condemned — — — — — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned — — — — — Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis — — — — — Tuberculosis only— Whole carcases condemned — — — — 1 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned — — — — Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis — — — — 3% Butchers' Shops. There are 40 retail butchers' shops, but in no instance was unsound meat exposed or prepared for sale ; 87 inspections were carried out during the year. Bakehouses. There are no underground bakehouses, but 21 premises came under inspection, calling for 64 visits. Five of these premises required notices for cleansing, but the standard generally is good. Dairies and Cowsheds, Etc. There are 24 farms, producing milk, and 33 dairies. These called for 178 routine visits, and 77 samples were taken during the year. Of the 24 farms, 12 are licensed to produce Tuberculin Tested milk and 3 are licensed to produce Accredited Milk. The following figures show the results of the Analyst's tests for cleanliness (Methylene Blue Test) : Designation. No. of Samples No. Passed No. Failed Tuberculin Tested 60 51 9 Accredited 15 9 6 Mixed Milk 2 1 1 The samples not complying with the test were followed up, and, as a result of action taken, were remedied. 22 Tuberculin Tested and Accredited Samples. In each case of failure a follow-up sample was taken and an investigation made in an endeavour to discover the cause of the failure. Where the follow-up samples also failed, as they did on two occasions, further samples were taken immediately and further inspections made. In both cases the failures were finally detected to be due to imperfect sterilisation of the dairy utensils. Improvements were immediately effected. Mixed Milk. In the case of the sample that revealed the presence of tubercle bacilli, the County Veterinary Inspector arranged for the slaughter of the infected animals. Ice Cream. Fifty-seven premises are registered for the sale of ice cream, and five are registered for the manufacture of Ice Cream. It is pleasing to note that the greater attention that has been paid to Ice Cream purity during the year has resulted in a better and safer product. It is important in dealing with Ice Cream not only to consider its purity, but also to see that its food standard is maintained. At the present moment there is no legal fat standard, but it is hoped that regulations will be made in this matter shortly. Thirty-nine samples were taken during the year, and a summary of their grading is as follows : Grade I 19 Grade III 7 Grade II 5 Grade IV 8 Investigations were made and advice given in the cases of samples graded as III. and IV., and further samples were taken. These showed a distinct improvement in each case. Restaurants, Hotels, Canteens, Etc. Eighty visits were made to these premises. A special survey was commenced of all food-preparing places at the latter part of the year with the intention of raising the standard of hygiene and safeguarding against the dangers of contamination and prevention of food poisoning. 23 Unsound Food. During 1948 332 condemnation certificates were issued, affecting in quantity 2 tons 5 cwts. of varied articles of food. No prosecutions were necessary, and the condemned food was utilised either for animal food or, where this was impracticable, destroyed. The co-operation of the traders was in all cases complete. 339 tins meat 300 ,, vegetables. 155 ,, preserves 268 ,, fish. 279 ,, fruit. 265 ,, milk. 2 ,, coffee. 2 „ cocoa. 2 „ sponge pudding. 12 „ tomato sauce. 59 jars pickles. 24 jars plums. 7 bottles orange juice. 3 bottles sauce. 1 carton dried egg. 28 boxes cheese. 1 lb. semolina. 2 Irish chickens. 2 Irish turkeys. 1 cwt. sausage rusk. 3 lb. plain flour. 27 ¾lb. butchers' meat. 18 cwt. fish. 11¼ lb. cheese. 3 cwt. 2½ lb. dried skimmed milk. 30 lb. sausages. 100 lb. herrings. 38 lb. dates. 150 lb. rabbit carcases. 37½ lb. bacon. 1 carcase pork. 24 SECTION E. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. In the Appendix is a tabulation of notified infectious diseases throughout the year. There were no serious epidemics, the epidemic of Poliomyelitis of the previous year having worked itself out, except for a few sporadic cases. Scarlet Fever. One hundred and twenty cases were notified, 52 of which were home-nursed and 63 treated in hospital. The infection continued. to be mild in type, and it does appear that this disease is no longer the acute disease of a few decades ago. The mildness of the infection, however, tends to "missed" cases, and consequently leads to spread of infection. Diphtheria. No cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year. This may be due to the intensive immunisation that has been carried out in recent years, but there are many other factors to be considered before one can be definite on this point. I have no available statistics of the state of immunisation in Orpington children, as records since the 5th July have been transferred to Maidstone and combined with those affecting Area 7 as a whole. Measles. Three hundred and twenty-eight cases of Measles were notified during the year, giving an attack rate of 5.6 per 1,000 population. There was no mortality. As this disease is largely a disease of the young child, an attack of Measles can have a farreaching debilitating effects. The control of the disease is not an easy matter, but careful nursing and isolation is not only necessary for the sake of the patient, but necessary for preventing the spread to others. The use of immune sera is not universally practised. Whooping Cough. Three hundred and ninety-nine cases were notified, giving a rate of 6.8 per 1,000 population. What has been said of Measles is equally applicable to Whooping Cough. Immunisation against this disease has not yet fully justified its use. 25 Tuberculosis. Sixty-two primary notifications of Tuberculosis were received during the year 53 of them being of the lungs and 9 other forms. The total number on the Tuberculosis Register at the year's end, so far as local records are concerned, was 511. The following tabulation gives an indication ot the tube] culous state of the population :— Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Total Cases M F M F (a) No. of cases of Tuberculosis on the register at the commencement of the year 244 175 82 73 574 (b) No. of cases notified under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations for the first time during the year 32 21 5 4 G2 (c) No. of cases restored to the register during the year — 1 — — 1 (d) Other additions to register during the year 9 4 — 3 16 (e) No. of cases removed from the register during the year 55 42 27 18 142 (f) No. of cases remaining on the register at the end of the year 230 159 60 62 511 If these figures are correct, and it is difficult to keep trace of the movements of notified Tuberculosis patients, the rate per 1,000 population is as high as 8.6. The greater facilities for diagnosis which now exist, while they lead to a high rate, do discover the disease in its early stages, with more likelihood of recovery. Many of the cases on the register are not active Tuberculosis, and there may be cases which have recovered and on which we have no information. It is of importance to know the ages of notified cases and the age at death of the tuberculous. In the case of children under 15 years of age, it is generally recognised that the infection is, as a rule, of bovine origin. Investigation into the milk supply for these children proved negative to T.B. in all cases investigated. This does not, however, eliminate the possibility of an infected milk having been taken from other sources and at other times. Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925. Public Health Act, Section 172. There was no occasion during 1948 to take action under the above provisions. 26 SECTION G. OTHER SERVICES. Diseases of Animals Acts. This is a service carried out by the County Council. Registries for Female Domestic Servants. There is one person so registered, and there were no contraventions. Regulation of the Use of Movable Dwellings. For the purpose of the above the Council granted (a) five licences authorising the use of land as sites for Movable Dwellings, and (b) two licences authorising persons to station and use such dwellings within the district. The type of licence mentioned under (a) is concerned with the control of holiday camping, in this district mainly week-end camping, which, though strongly to be encouraged in the interests of national health, can, in the absence of control, bring certain difficulties in its train. The sites licensed are all situated in country surroundings, and have a proper water supply, proper washing facilities, and a sufficient number of sanitary conveniences. Licences granted under (b) are normally to persons who wish to station a caravan or similar vehicle on a specified piece of land for a limited period, but again permission is only granted where the provision of the essential sanitary services is practicable, 27 APPENDICES. 1.
