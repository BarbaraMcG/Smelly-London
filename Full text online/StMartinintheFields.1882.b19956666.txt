JOHN PYBUS, HENRY R. BURTON, Auditors. Vr.sT*Y Hall, >rd At'punl, ISsj. 55 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 18 8 2. Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the Fields, for the Year 1882. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Thirteenth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The Smallpox epidemic, which prevailed to such an extent in the previous year, gradually declined during the year 1882. The mortality was slightly in excess of the former year, due to the increased number of deaths which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, there being 40 more than in the year 1881, 56 Births. The Births registered in the year 1882 were 412. This number is 6 less than in the previous year. The following Table gives the number of Births occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 20 10 30 February 21 12 33 March 20 16 36 April 15 19 34 May 23 18 41 June 19 17 36 July 10 20 30 August 19 16 35 September 20 17 37 October 17 14 31 November 17 23 40 December 17 12 29 218 194 412 The Births registered in London in the year 1882 numbered 133,200, and were in the proportion of 34.3 to 1,000 inhabitants. This was the lowest birthrate recorded in 20 years, that is since 1862, in which year the rate was 34.2. 57 Deaths. The Deaths during the year numbered 474. This mortality was 23 in excess of the previous year. The following Table gives the number of Deaths occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 15 9 24 February 26 21 47 March 29 20 49 April 27 17 44 May 28 14 42 June 22 15 37 July 18 9 27 August 20 23 43 September 19 11 30 October 24 18 42 November 29 17 46 December 28 15 43 285 189 474 Of the above 474 Deaths, 188 occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and of this number who died in the Hospital, 154 were non-residents in the Parish. These 154 deaths deducted from the total deaths will form a basis on which to estimate the death-rate of the Parish. 58 Deaths, 1882 474 Deduct non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 154 320 Death.rate per 1,000 for the year 1882, 17.0 Ratio of Deaths to population 1 in 56.7 In estimating the population I have added the inhabitants of the Peabody Buildings, which establishment was not completed when the Census of April 1st, 1881, was taken. In London the Deaths numbered 82,905 and were in the proportion of 21.4 per 1,000 Appended is the annual death.rate per 1,000 in the parish of St. Martin.in.the.Fields during the last ten years:— 1873 20.2 1874 18.6 1875 18.3 1876 17.2 1877 16 9 1878 17.5 1879 18.6 1880 16.8 1881 18.5 1882 17.6 59 Ages at Death. Of the 474 deaths, 82 occurred under I year, 82 from 1 to 5 years, 38 from 5 to 20 years, 87 from 20 to 40 years, 123 from 40 to 60 years, 52 from 60 to 80 years, and 10 above 80 years. Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—The seven principal Zymotic Diseases, the diseases most influenced by sanitation, caused 49 deaths, inclusive of those which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital. This number is 11 less than in the previous year. Smallpox.—No death from this disease was registered. The Relieving Officer reports 7 cases sent to the Smallpox Hospitals. In London 431 deaths occurred from this malady in the year 1882. Measles.—There were 7 deaths from this disease, the same number as in the previous year. Scarlet Fever.—3 deaths only were due to this malady. This mortality is exceptionally low. Diphtheria.—14 deaths were caused by this disease; this number is greatly in excess of former years, but it is only fair to state that out of this GO number 10 were non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital, so that only 4 belonged to the Parish. The Registrar-General in his Annual Summary for the year 1882, says: " In London Diphtheria appears to have been more than usually fatal." Whooping Cough was fatal to 13, this number was 6 more than in the previous year. Fever.—This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever, and Remittent Fever. 5 deaths were registered from this class of disorders, they were all due to Typhoid Fever, and 3 out of the 5 occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, in non-residents. The Relieving Officer sent 6 cases of this disease to the Asylum Hospitals. Diarrhcea.—7 deaths were caused by this malady, 6 of which were in young children. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, including Consumption, destroyed 139. This number is 22 more than in the preceding year. Diseases of the Heart.—40 deaths were due to this complaint, against 30 of the previous year. CANCER proved fatal to 16 persons. The deaths from all other causes, with the ages at death, will be found fully detailed further on. CI Inquests. In the year 1882, 69 inquests were held. Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— Natural causes 25 Run over or knocked down in the street 11 Burns and scalds 4 Suffocation (Children when in bed with Parents) 4 Pistol-shot wound (suicide) 1 Injuries received in extinguishing fire at Alhambra Theatre 1 Injuries received from falling down stairs 7 „ „ when fighting 1 „ „ from falling from a wall 1 „ ,, from fall through skylight 1 ,, „ from falling from a stool 1 „ „ from falling from a window 1 ,, „ from being squeezed between railway car and platform at Charing Cross Station, S.E.R. 1 Poisoning with ether 1 Wounds of Throat with razor (suicide) 1 Wounds . 5 Drowning (no evidence how deceased came into the water) 1 Hanging (suicide) 2 69 62 Sanitary Work. In the year 1882, 98 formal notices were served upon the owners or occupiers of property, besides numerous verbal recommendations to remedy sanitary defects. One summons was taken out. The owner of 66, Drury Lane, allowed an underground dwelling, not meeting the requirements of the Act, to be inhabited in defiance of two notices served upon him for its vacation. The summons was heard before Mr. Flowers, at Bow Street, when the owner was fined forty shillings and costs. Two houses, 1 and 2, Little Catherine Street, which had been a source of trouble and annoyance for many years, owing to their dilapidated, unsanitary and dirty condition, were closed without resorting to legal measures, the owner consenting to shut them up. The pipe-sewers have been regularly flushed, those gullies emitting offensive effluvia have also been flushed with carbolic acid and water, and the several courts and passages in the Parish lime-whited. In conclusion, I must again bear testimony to the zeal and intelligence of your Inspector in the discharge of his duties, and also acknowledge with thanks, the promptitude with which the Relieving 63 Officer of the district keeps me informed of all infectious diseases and nuisances coming under his notice. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Craven Street, June, 1883. Ill Summary of Sanitary Work performed during the Year 1882.
