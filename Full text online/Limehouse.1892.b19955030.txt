During the season which commenccd on the 1st March, 1892, and terminated on the 18th October, 1S92, the streets were watered by the contractors with water supplied by the East London Water Works Company, the quantity of water used during the season being 6,130,000 gallons. public urinals. The number of public urinals in the District is 26, containing 99 compartments. 46 The urinals arc flushed and cleansed three times every day by men employed by the Board, the water being supplied by the East London Water Works Company.

The Contractors are proceeding with the work of widening the railway under the powers of the special Act, entitled 'London and Blackwall Railway Act, 1885," (48 and 49 Victoria, chap, cxiv.) 47 union stairs, wapping. The necessary consent of the Thames Conservancy and the London County Council having been obtained to the carrying out of permanent flood works at these stairs in lieu of the existing tide gate, the Hoard authorised the same to be proceeded with and the work has been carried out by the Board's contractor. With the view of affording additional safety to the public after dark, an iron hand railing has been fixed. tramways. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company have relaid the defective paving in West India Dock Road and in various parts of Commercial Road. drippings from bridges. The Great Eastern Railway have fixed iron trays under the bridges crossing Salter Street and Limehouse Causeway to prevent drippings therefrom. improvements. BEN JONSON ROAD. In May, I.SQ2, the Clerk of the London County Council wrote, in reply to the letter from the Hoard referred to in my last Report, that the Improvements Committee was prepared to recommend the Council to introduce a clause into one of its Hills 'to enable the Hoard to contribute to the cost of the proposed widening of the West end of lien Jonson Road, it being understood that the Council's contribution would be half the nett cost, not exceeding £3,070, and that upon the Hoard and the Mile End Vestry consenting to this arrangement, the Committee would take up their recommendation to the 48 Council. The letter was referred to the Works Committee, and I was directed to communicate with the Surveyor of the Vestry of Mile End Old Town upon the subject. It will be remembered that on the 6th May, 1891,the Board passed a Resolution agreeing to contribute a sum not exceeding £1,000 to the cost, of the Improvement, the Mile End Vestry paying a like sum. The estimate of the London County Council, however, amounted to £6,140, of which it was proposed that the Board should tribute £,535. I saw the Surveyor of Mile End, who informed me that that Vestry would probably rescind the Resolution limiting their share of the expense to £l,000, and the Works Committee recommended the Hoard to adopt a similar course. A Special Meeting of the Board was held on the 13th July, when a motion to expunge the words "not exceeding £1,000" from the Resolution of the 6th May, 1891, was defeated, eleven members voting in favour of the motion, and on the contrary twelve. The proposal then dropped, but in November the following Resolution was passed:— "That the Improvements Committee of the London County Council be informed that this Hoard does not see its way to enlarge its contribution towards the widening of Ben Jonson Road, West end, as they rely upon their Surveyor's estimate; and they request your Committee's reconsideration of the matter, and that your Committee will ask the Council to seek Parliamentary powers for carrying the said Improvement out on its original estimated cost of £4,000, upon the terms originally proposed, viz: that your Council contribute £2,000, Mile End £1,000, and Limehouse District Board £1,000." A copy of the Resolution was sent to the Improvements Committee, and the Clerk of the Council replied that the Committee was not prepared to make any departure from its previous decision. NEW THOROUGHFARE FROM BROAD STREET TO CRANFORD STREET. The following Memorial as to the proposed formation of a new thoroughfare from Broad Street to Cranford Street was presented to the London County Council in June:- "To the London County Council. "The Memorial of the Hoard of Works for the Limehouse District, in the County of London, sheweth:— "i. That your Memorialists arc one of the bodies mentioned in Schedule B of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and incorporated by Section 42 of that Act, and that under the said Act the streets and highways of the Limehouse District arc vested in your Memorialists, who have the control and management and improvement of the same. "2. That your Memorialists since 1855 have expended from time to time large sums of money in widening the narrow portions of the streets near the River Thames, and to which the Metropolitan Board of Works largely contributed. "3. That your Memorialists would call the attention of the Council to the fact that the narrowness of the part of Broad Street, Ratcliff, west of Hubbuck's Wharf, and the narrowness and inconvenience of the western approaches thereto, cause great loss and inconvenicncc to the public generally ; that vessels are constantly arriving and departing from the large wharves in the locality, and large quantities of goods arc shipped and landed thereat, and delivered to all parts of London, including the Railway Depots; that many of the passengers travelling by the steam vessels are very much inconvenienccd in getting to and from the wharves, it being a fact that that part of Broad Street on many days in the week is virtually impassible for the through traffic. "4. That the construction of a new road from Broad Street to Brook Street would greatly relieve the congested condition of the traffic in Broad Street and form an alternative route which would be largely used and be a great boon to the commercial and trading interests of the Metropolis. The suggested road is shewn on the annexed plan and coloured red ; it will have a clear width of 30 feet and a length of 79 yards or thereabouts. It is also suggested that a small portion of the Brook Street area should be utilised for the purpose of forming a better roadway through Cranford Street to Brook Street. When completed it would form a new and important 50 fare from Broad Street to the Commercial Road, of which the proposed extension of Dorset Street in connection with the Queen Catherine Court unhealthy area would form part. "5. That the construction of the said road would increase the value of the Brook Street area by giving a convenient and direct access from it to Brook Street. It is estimated that tlu cost of acquiring the land necessary for the road will amount to £8,500, and the cost of forming and paving the road and footpaths will amount to the sum of £800, exclusive of legal and other expenses. "Your Memorialists would therefore respectfully urge the Council to give the subject of this Memorial their favourable consideration, and direct that the necessary steps be taken to carry out the suggested improvements as a County Improvement." The Council replied that they were of opinion that the amount of through traffic which would pass along the new street would not be sufficient to justify an expenditure being made out of the County Fund. Moreover, the Council considered the Improvement was one of a local character, and one which if undertaken should be carried out by the Local Authority, and the Council was therefore not prepared to undertake the work. The matter is now under the consideration of the Works Committee. NARROW STREET. In June 1892, a Memorial, of which the following is a copy, was presented to the London County Council. To the London County Council. The Memorial of the Board of Works for the Limehouse District in the County of London, sheweth : "I. That your Memorialists are one of the bodies mentioned in Schedule 15 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and 51 incorporated by Section 42 of that Act, and that under the said Act the streets and highways of the Limehouse District are vested in your Memorialists who have the control and management and improvement of the same. "2. That your Memorialists since 1855 have expended from time to time large sums of money in widening the narrow portions of the streets near the River Thames, and to which the Metropolitan Hoard of Works largely contributed. "3. That a Memorial has lately been received from the owners and occupiers of premises in Narrow Street, Ratcliff, complaining of the narrowness of the street and the difficulty of access to and egress from the several wharves and warehouses in that thoroughfare, the greater part of the street being only sufficiently wide to allow one vehicle to pass at a time, which causes much loss and inconvenience to them and to the public generally. "4. That your Memorialists, after careful consideration, find that the cost of widening Narrow Strict would be so great that they would not be justified in incurring the consequent expense. "5. That your Memorialists with the view of meeting the difficulty, suggest that the West end of Narrow Street should be widened by setting back the fronts of the houses 19-fcct, and by widening the roadway adjoining thereto from 12-feet 6-inches to 22-feet. and from 14-feet i-inch to 18-feet 1-inch, as shown upon the annexed plan and coloured red; and that Noah's Ark Alley at the Last end of Narrow Street should be widened from 8-feet 5-inches to 42-feet at the North end, and from 3-feet 6-inches to 32-feet at the South end as shown on the said plan and coloured red. "6. That the widening of the West end of Narrow Street would, by forming a lay by and improved access to the wharves and premises in that portion of the street, give great facilities to the traffic; and that the formation of the new street at the East end, by giving a direct access to Medland Street, and through the Horseferry Branch Road to the Commercial Road, would also greatly facilitate the traffic in the street. 52 "7.That the estimated cost of widening the West end of the street is £1,640 (one thousand six hundred and forty pounds) and that the estimated cost of acquiring the land for the formation of the new thoroughfare at the East end by widening Noahs Ark Alley—by which only one premises will be affected — is £2,250 (two thousand two hundred and fifty pounds), and of forming and paving the new road and footpaths £800 (eight hundred pounds), each of the estimates being exclusive of legal and other expenses. "Your Memorialists would therefore respectfully urge the Council to give the subject of this Memorial their favourable consideration by approving the proposed improvements and contributing towards the same one half the expense." The Council replied that having carefully considered the subject they were of opinion that the proposed improvements were of too local a character to justify the Council in making a contribution towards the cost. Moreover, it was said the requirements of the traffic in the neighbourhood by Narrow Street might be so altered by the construction of the proposed Rother hithe and Ratcliff Ferry, that the Council would hesitate to contribute at that time to any improvement in that locality. The Council, therefore, whilst giving its consent to the proposed widening of Narrow Street and Noah's Ark Alley, was not prepared to contribute to the cost. The matter is now under the consideration of the Works Committee, to whom the letter of the Council was referred. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. queen catherine court area. In April, 1892, the Board were informed that the London County Council had decided to make application to the Home secretary for power to erect dwellings on the area in Brook 53 Street, cleared under the provisions of the Artizan's Dwellings Acts. In the same month the Hoard approved the alternative scheme prepared by the Council for the improvement of the Queen Catherine Court area, and to which I referred in my previous annual report, coupled with the proposed improvement of Dorset Street, upon condition that the Council agreed to contribute one half of the cost of carrying the same into effect. On the 8th June, a letter was laid before the Hoard from the Clerk of the Council stating that providing the scheme was carried out forthwith in accordance with the plans and estimates approved by the Committee of the Council, the Council would contribute one half of the nett cost thereof, and the Hoard thereupon ordered the necessary steps to be taken for carrying the scheme into effect. The preliminary requirements of the Act having been complied with, a Local Inquiry was held by S. J. Smith, Esq., C.E., an Inspector of the Local Government Hoard, at the offices of the District Hoard, on Thursday, 16th March, 1893, at which I gave evidence in support of the scheme, but at the time of closing this report the result of the inquiry had not been made known. kino johns court area. In the month of May, 1892, the attention of the Sanitary Committee was called to the condition of certain houses on the north side of Limchousc Causeway abutting on part of the area proposed to be dealt with under the King John's Court scheme, and the Medical Officer and myself were directed to report as to including such houses in the Scheme. We accordingly inspected the premises Nos. 76, 78, 8o, 82, 84, 86, 88, and 90, Limchousc Causeway, and Nos. 111 and 113, Three Colt Street, and I submitted an amended Scheme showing that in the event of the premises being acquired Limchousc Causeway from Three Colt Street could be widened at the south end from 7 feet 3 inches to 30 feet; opposite Spread Eagle Court from 12 feet 6 inches to 25 feet; and at the Gill Street end from 19 feet to 20 feet, The Committee recommended the Hoard to approve this plan upon condition that the London County Council consented to contribute one half the cost of carrying the Scheme into effect and to lend the Hoard the other half upon terms to be agreed. Upon this recommendation being submitted to the Hoard the matter was referred back to the Committee for further consideration, but the Committee adhered 54 to their decision and it was subsequently approved and adopted by the Board. The Council were informed accordingly, and the Superintending Architect thereupon wrote asking for the following information:— "(a) What is the extent of the surplus land proposed to be sold ? "(b) What arc the suggested positions for the buildings for rehousing artizans proposed to be erected on the site coloured red, and what is the number to be accommodated in the building ? "(c) What is the number of persons belonging to the working classes who will be displaced by the proposed Improvement ?" I made a report upon the subject to the Sanitary Committee, and by their direction informed the Superintending Architect that the area of the surplus land proposed to be sold, and not forming part of the unhealthy area, was about feet. I also forwarded to him a plan showing the sites of the houses proposed to be erected, and stated that the same when built would afford accommodation for 100 persons, the number of persons of the artizan class, including children, to be displaced being 21. In July the Clerk of the London County Council wrote that after careful consideration the Public Health Committee were of opinion that the area was too confined for rehousing except on the frontages to Gill Street and Three Colt Street, and that the only satisfactory method of dealing with it would be to devote it to the purposes of an open space, and they were therefore unable to approve the plan submitted. He further stated that in the event of the Board being willing to prepare a scheme for the improvement of the area on the following lines the Committee would be prepared to recommend the Council to contribute one half of the cost of the same. "(a) That the whole of the buildings situated between Limehouse Causeway and King John's Court be cleared and the vacant space used as a playground. 55 "(b) That the houses on the North side of the Causeway be excluded from the scheme, being commercial premises and not, in the opinion of the Committee, of a sufficiently insanitary character to necessitate their inclusion in a scheme of this nature." In reply, the Council were informed that if an "open space" meant a wide thoroughfare the Board would agree to the suggestion, especially if the Council consented to contribute one half the cost. The Clerk of the Council thereupon wrote that subject to plans of the scheme being approved by the Public Health Committee, and on the understanding that no buildings were erected on the area, the Committee would be prepared to recommend the Council to contribute one half of the cost of dealing with the area by the formation of a wide thoroughfare from Three Colt Street to Gill Street. The Board referred the letter to the Works Committee, with instructions to take steps for the carrying out of the proposed scheme with the utmost speed. I prepared a plan of the scheme and submitted the same to the Works Committee, upon whose recommendation the Hoard directed that a copy of the plan should be sent to the Council with a request that the Council would contribute one half the cost of the work. This was done, and in January the Clerk of the Council wrote asking what the Hoard proposed to do with the vacant land lying between King John's Court and the suggested new thoroughfare. By direction of the Hoard I replied that it was suggested that King John's Court should be stopped up, and a portion of the surplus land offered to the School Hoard for London for their purposes, and that the remainder of the land would be offered to the owners of the premises abutting on King John's Court. The decision of the Council upon the subject has not yet been received. chusan place area. The question of dealing with this area has been under consideration from time to time during the year, and the Medical Officer and myself were, in the month of October, requested to prepare a fresh scheme for the improvement of the site. Subsequently, however, a letter was received from the Clerk of the 56 London County Council to the effect that the Council had caused a further inspection to be made of the area, and learnt that improvements had taken place, and that the condition of the property was no longer such as to necessitate action On the part of the Council. The matter therefore dropped. EMANATIONS FROM SEWERS. Complaint having been made of the nuisance caused by the emanation of noxious effluvia from gullies in Salmon Lane Limchouse, the gullies were examined and found to be in good order and properly trapped. Upon enquiry,several occupiers of shops in Salmon Lane stated that in a general way there was no cause for complaint, but that upon certain occasions the nuisance was intolerable, this being especially the case on Saturdays. I reported to the Board that the nuisance arose from the pressure of gas in the Main Sewer, the end of which was opposite the entrance to Mr. Last's timber yard, and that the only remedy I could suggest was for a ventilating shaft to be carried up from the manhole of the Main Sewer above the roof of one of the adjoining houses, which in my opinion would prevent the recurrence of the nuisance. The Board directed that the attention of the London County Council be called to the matter, and that they be requested to have a ventilating shaft constructed. MAINTENANCE OF DISTURNPIKED ROADS. The London County Council informed the Board that the Award of the Arbitrator appointed by the Local Government Board had been made with regard to the amount to be contributed by the Council towards the cost of the maintenance of the Finchley and Ldgware Roads, from which it appeared that the Council was directed to pay to the Hampstead Vestry a sum equal to rather less than half the average annual cost as stated by the Vestry. The matter was considered by the Works Committee, to whom I submitted a detailed statement of the cost of the maintenance and repair of the Main Roads in the District for the years 1889-90, 1890-1, and 1891-2, and of which the following is a summary:— 57 £ Estimated cost per annum of the maintenance of carriageways in Commercial Road, East and West India Dock Roads, and Horseferry Branch Road 1,089 Ditto ditto footways 221 Ditto ditto scavenging and watering 1,375 Making a total of £2,685 To which should be added the estimated proportion of establishment charges 256 And making the estimated annual cost of maintaining the said roads £2,941 The statement was sent to the Engineer of the Council, and in October a letter was received offering as the Council's contribution a sum equal to one half of the average actual annual cost during the three years ended 31st March, 1892, of maintenance and repair, to be ascertained and agreed upon between the Council and the Hoard, such contribution to commence as from the 1st April, 1889, and to continue until the 31st March, 1896, or until such time as the Council's legal position with reference to the roads referred to should be altered. Such letter was considered by the Works Committee, who requested me to communicate with the Council and to agree if possible without prejudice the amount of the average actual annual cost of maintenance, &c., during the years mentioned, leaving the question of the proportion to be borne by the Council for future decision. I accordingly saw the Engineer of the Council upon the subject, and an officer of the Council subsequently attended at the Offices of the Hoard and examined my estimate with the accounts, and as a result a letter was received in February, 1893, offering as the Council's annual contribution the sum of £1,410 being one half of £2,685, the average actual annual cost, plus £134 5s. (5 per cent, thereon) for establishment charges. The letter was referred to the Finance Committee, and upon their recommendation the Board decidcd to accept the offer. 58 MORTUARY ACCOMMODATION, &c. In April, 1892, the Board authorised me to negociatc with the Blackwall Railway with a view to the acquisition by the Board of the two arches, No. 219 and 220, in Little John Street, Ratcliff, with the land in the rear there of, adjoining that belonging to the Hoard and utilised as a Mortuary and Disinfecting Station. I accordingly entered into communication with the Company, and in May reported that the Railway Company had discontinued granting leases of the arches, hut under the circumstances, and considering the purpose for which the arches would be used, they were willing to let the same to the Hoard at a rent of £55 per annum in lieu of £80, the amount originally asked by their agent), the tenancy being determinable by either party upon six months notice in writing being given, a condition also being inserted in the agreement that the Company would bind themselves not to give notice to the Hoard to quit unless the arches referred to were bona fide required for the purposes of the Railway, The Hoard decided to accept the tenancy upon the terms mentioned. I subsequently laid before the Sanitary Committee a sketch plan showing the proposed utilisation of the arches for mortuary and disinfecting purposes. the accommodation in the existing mortuary (No. 218 arch) contained an area of 406 superficial feet The proposed new mortuary would have an area of 1,044 feet, and would be divided into two compartments, one to be used for infectious cases and the other for non-infectious cases. In the rear there would be accommodation for post-mortem examinations, with a communication from each mortuary. As regards the disinfecting apparatus, the present chamber contained an area of 477 feet, the area of the proposed new chamber being 1,836 feet, the infected articles would be received in Little John Street, and delivered, after disinfection, in Caroline Street. I considered, without having made a detailed estimate, that the cost would be about £700. I further reported that I had been in communication with Messrs. Manlove, Alliott & Co. as to supplying the necessary apparatus, the cost of which, complete, would be about £350. I stated that if the proposed works were carried out the accommodation would be ample, and the other arch not being required could be utilised for various pui poses, such as the stores, &c., for which the Board at that 59 time had no proper place. The Board approved the sketch plan and I was requested to prepare detailed plans and specifications in accordance with my report. The necessary plans and specifications were prepared and approved by the Hoard and ordered to be carried into execution. The tender of Messrs. Manlove, Alliott & Co., for supplying a Washington Lyon's Steam Disinfector was also accepted. I was directed on the 22nd March, to submit the plans to the Local Government Hoard for approval, which was done, but no reply had been received up to the date of the closing of this Report. I have communicated with the owners of certain premises with a view to the acquisition thereof by the Hoard as a place of refuge for persons compelled to leave their homes during the disinfection of the same. Up to the present time, however, the Hoard has been unable to come to any decision upon the subject. OWNERLESS LAND. On the 27th April, 1892, the Board resolved as follows:— "That, having regard to the fact that there arc in the District several plots of land with or without houses thereon, for which no owners can be found and which arc used for such purposes as to cause them to be nuisances to the neighbourhood, the London County Council be asked to obtain Parliamentary powers to enable the Local Authority to take possession of such land and houses for the benefit of the ratepayers." "That a copy of the foregoing Resolution be sent to the several District Boards and Vestries in the Metropolis with a request for an expression of an opinion thereon." Copies of the first Resolution was sent as directed, and many Local Authorities passed Resolutions to the same effect, but the County Council replied expressing the opinion that the better course would be for the Hoard itself to seek Parliamentary powers if they were thought desirable. Upon this the Board informed the Council that they entirely dissented from such 60 opinion, and felt that as the subject was of Metropolitan interest Parliamentary powers should be sought by the Council rather than by a Local Authority. EAST LONDON WATER WORKS COMPANY. The attention of the Hoard was called to the fact that the East London Water Works Company had introduced a clause into a Bill before Parliament whereby the use of fittings stamped or supplied by the Company was rendered obligatory, upon the owners of property, and a penalty imposed in the event of any other fittings being employed. A Special Committee was appointed to consider the matter, and the Hoard on their recommendation presented a Memorial to the London County Council stating the points objected to by the Hoard in the Hill, and asking them to give consideration thereto in their opposition, and also stating that if necessary the Hoard would be prepared to attend with witnesses before the Committee of the House. The Hill was ultimately rejected by the House of Commons and no further steps were therefore necessary. JAMES STREET, RATCLIF F. As requested by the Hoard, I had an interview with the Engineer of the Great Eastern Railway Company with reference to the works carried out by the Company in James Street, Ratcliff, and the manner in which the street was affected thereby. I laid before the Works Committee a letter from the Engineer stating that as the land was the property of the Railway Company, he would be prepared, with a view of meeting the requirements of the Hoard, to put up gates at each end of the passage. I he Engineer also stated that the houses in James Street were acquired of necessity by reason of the Company taking possession of the street, and it had been considered desirable in the Company s interest to purchase the houses outright. As regards the unpaved part of the street, I reported that the Company had expressed their willingness to pave certain portions shown on the plan which I submitted to the committee, and to put in a proper gulley to carry off the surface water. The Hoard approved the same. 61 SNOW STORM. In consequence of a fall of snow which took place on the 17th January, 1893, 59 men were engaged on the following day to assist in clearing the same, 14 being employed the whole day, and 45 for three quarters of a day. The total cost of the extra labour was £9 1s. 2d. ADVERTISING ON LAMP COLUMNS. The attention of the Hoard was called to the system adopted by Messrs. Heath, of Birmingham, of advertising on lamp columns, and Messrs. Heath have been requested to fit up a sample lamp in the District to enable the Board to form an opinion as to the advisability of making an arrangement with them. SMOKE NUISANCE. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, having thrown upon the Hoard the duty of dealing with infringements of the provisions of the said Act relating to smoke consumption, a notice was issued to proprietors of factories, &c., in the District as follows:— PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. SMOKE CONSUMPTION. Notice to Manufacturers and others. By the above mentioned Act it is provided as follows:— Section 23.— (1) Every furnace employed in the working of engines by steam, and every furnace employed in any public bath or 62 house, or in any mill, factory, printing-house, dye-house, iron foundry, glass-house, distillery, brew-house, sugar refinery, bakehouse, gas works, waterworks, or other buildings used tor the purpose of trade or manufacture (although a strain engine be not used or employed therein), shall be constructed so as to consume or burn the smoke arising from such furnace. (2) If any person being the owner or occupier of the premises, or being a foreman or ether person employed by such owner or occupier: (a) Uses any such furnace which is not constructed so as to consume or burn the smoke arising therefrom; or (b) So negligently uses any such furnace as that the smoke arising therefrom is not effectually consumed or burnt; or (c) Carries on any trade or business which occasions any noxious or offensive effluvia, or otherwise annoys the neighbourhood or inhabitants, without using the best practicable means for preventing or counteracting such effluvia or other annoyance: such person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds, and on a second conviction to a fine of ten pounds, and on each subsequent conviction to a fine double the amount of the fine imposed on the last preceding conviction. (4) Provided that in this Section the words "consume or burn the smoke," shall not be held in all cases to mean "consume or burn all the smoke," and the Court hearing an information against a person may remit the fine if of opinion that such person has so constructed his furnace as to consume or burn as far as possible all the smoke arising from such furnace, and has carefully attended to the same, and consumed or burned as far as possible the smoke arising from such furnace. 63 Section 24.— (a) Any fireplace or furnace which does not, as far as practicable, consume the smoke arising from the combustible used therein, and which is used for working engines by steam, or in any mill, factory, dye-house, brewery, bake-house, or gaswork, or in any manufacturing or trade process whatsoever; and (b) Any chimney (not being the chimney of a private dwelling-house) sending forth black smoke in such quantities as to be a nuisance; shall be nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act, and the provisions of this Act relating to those nuisances shall apply accordingly: Provided that the Court hearing a complaint against a person in respect of a nuisance arising from a fireplace or furnace which does not consume the smoke arising from the combustible used in such fireplace or furnace, shall hold that no nuisance is created and dismiss the complaint, if satisfied that such fireplace or furnace is constructed in such manner as to consume as far as practicable, having regard to the nature of the manufacture or trade, all smoke arising therefrom, and that such fireplace or furnacc has been carefully attended to by the person having the charge thereof. By Order. Several instances of contravention of the Act have been reported, and in each instance notice has been given that proceedings would be taken in the event of a repetition of the offence. STONE YARD, WHITE HORSE STREET. With regard to the obstruction of the light and air of the Stone Yard in White Horse Street, caused by the widening of 64 the Black wall Railway Company, I reported to the Works Committee that I had seen the Land Agent of the Great Eastern Railway Company upon the subject, and I submitted a letter from him stating that he was prepared to recommend the Company to let to the Hoard for the purpose of a Stone Yard the two new arches and the land on the south side thereof (colored Red on the plan) at the nominal rent of £2 per annum, and to give an undertaking that the tenancy should not be determined unless the premises were required by the Company for railway purposes. The Hoard resolved to accept the terms offered. THAMES COMMUNICATION. The London County Council decided to apply to Parliament for powers to form a Free Ferry across the River Thames from Ratcliff to Rotherhithe, and a Hill was duly deposited, but owing to difficulties with respect to the question of "betterment" the scheme was withdrawn. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Notice was received from the County of London Electric Lighting Company of their intention to apply to the Hoard of Trade for a Provisional Order authorising the said Company to supply electrical energy within the District, but the Company did not proceed with the matter. In March, 1893, the Hoard appointed a Committee to consider the whole question of the lighting of the District, with power to visit such places as might be necessary for the purpose of obtaining information upon the subject. FIRE ALARMS AND FIRE ESCAPES. In my last Report I stated that the London County Council had written pointing out the desirability of indicating the positions of Fire Alarms and Fire Lscapes by means of tablets affixed in on upon the street lamps or otherwise, to which the 65 Board had replied that they did not object to tablets being so affixed, provided the work was carried out by and at the expense of the Council. The Council afterwards expressed the opinion that the work should be carried out by and at the expense of the District Board and Vestries, upon which the Board informed the Council that they considered that as the fixing of Fire Alarm and Fire Escape Indicators was a matter of Metropolitan importance, the work should be undertaken and the cost thereof borne by the Council, as in the event of the Local Authorities undertaking the duty, much inconvenience would arise on account of the divided responsibility. MARKET STREET. On the 13th July, the Board resolved:— "That Market Street, RatclifT, being a new street within the Limehousc District, is not paved and drained to the satisfaction of the Board, and that it is necessary that the same should be well and sufficiently paved and drained; and that as recommended by the Committee the plan and apportionment prepared by the Surveyor be approved, and that orders be made upon the owners of the land and houses in Market Street aforesaid for the payment of the expenses in accordance with the said apportionment; and further that the Surveyor be authorised to proceed with the works forthwith." The owners of the property disputed their liability to pay the amounts claimed from them, and proceedings were taken against them, when orders were made for the payment of the several sums. REPAIRING MACADAM ROADS. Certain allegations having been made with respect to the manner in which the repair of the Carriageway of Burdett Road was carried out, the Board appointed a Special Committee to enquire into the matter, and to report as to the repairing and making up of roads in the future. The Committee, after an exhaustive 66 inquiry, made the following recommendations, which were subsequently approved and adopted by the Board, viz:— 1.—That a new book be opened and kept by the Accountant, shewing a correct record of every repair or road making, with separate cost of labour, quantities of material and cost, and any other charges on every job, and in the case of macadam roads, shewing the average depth of new material and total average cost per yard super and per yard cube. 2.—That in all cases the quantity of material required to repair any road shall be ascertained and settled by the Surveyor. 3.—That the steam roller in future be not ordered to any job until the metalling is laid; and that your Committee, after careful consideration, do not advise the purchase of a steam roller, seeing that the total payments under this head from 1887 to the end of 1892—a period of 6 years—amounted to £705 3s. 9d., or an average expenditure of ,£117 10s. 7d. per annum, but that new Tenders be obtained, by advertisement, for the hire of steam roller when required. 4.—That it is absolutely necessary in order to exercise a proper supervision over this Boards work— (a) That the Clerk of Works must reside within the District. (b) 1 hat a head ganger be employed, to be left in permanent charge of all work during progress; able to read and write, check weights, &c., and competent to control workmen. 5—That the Clerk of Works and the Road Inspector be required to open and keep a daily journal of all work done under their superintendence. 6.—That in addition to the present Committees of the Board, a special' Survey Committee be elected. 67 7.—That during this enquiry, it has come to the knowledge of the Committee that considerable ill feeling and friction exists between two of the officials, and seeing that the interests of the Hoard must of necessity suffer in consequence, the Committee considers that the attention of the Surveyor should immediately be called to this fact, and further that the Board should consider the advisability of placing the Clerk of Works upon the same footing as the other officials, both as regards the mode of paying his salary and the wearing of the Hoard's uniform. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board.
