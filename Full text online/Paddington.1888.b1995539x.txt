'THE PARISH OF PADDINGTON, in the County of London, extends Northward from the Marble Arch to Kilburn Gate; and Westward from the Marble Arch to Kensington Palace Gardens; it is bounded on the North by Willesden; on the South by St. George's, Hanover Square, and St. Margaret, Westminster; on the East by Marylebone; and on the West by Kensington and the detached portion of St. Luke, Chelsea; its length from North to South being nearly Two Miles, and its superficial extent about 1,280 acres. II, Parliamentary Electoral Divisions. In 1885 Paddington was constituted a separate Parliamentary Borough by the Redistribution of Seats Act (48 and 49 Victoria, cap. 23). The Borough returns Two Members to Parliament, and for the purposes of election it is divided into Two Divisions, 10 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. under the names of North Paddington and South Paddington. North Paddington consists of Ward No. 2, and South Paddington of Wards Nos. 1, 3, and 4. The number of Borough Voters, according to the Register made in 1888, is as follows:— North Paddington 5,701 South Paddington 5,018 Total 10,719 The number of Parliamentary County Voters in Paddington is 101. The following are the particulars of the Parliamentary Elections which have taken place in the Borough, viz.:— North Paddington. 1885, November.— Lionel L. Cohen, M.P. (deceased). 1886, June.— „ „ „ 1887, July.— John Aird, M.P. South Paddington. 1885, November.— Right Hon. Lord Randolph Churchill, M.P. 1886, June.— „ „ „ III. Registration Districts. The Registrar-General has divided Paddington into two Districts for the Registration of Births and Deaths, called respectively the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional lino of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street, from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish; the St. Mary's District lying on the North and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line. 11 REPORT, 1888-9. Registrars of Births, Deaths, and Marriages. Superintendent Registrar— Henry F. Aveling. Registrar's Office, 287, Harrow Road. Registrar of Marriages— William Kirk, 78, Westbourne Park Road. Registrars of Births and Deaths— St. Mary's District, William Kirk, 78, Westbourne Park Road. St. John's District, Matthew Batten Cranstone, 35, Spring Street, Sussex Gardens. IV. Poor-Law Administration. The Paddington Workhouse and Infirmary are situate in the Harrow Road; the management is in the hands of a Board of Guardians, Eighteen of whom are Elected Guardians (elected by the Ratepayers). The resident Justices of the Peace are ex-officio Members of the Board. Paddington is united with St. George Hanover Square, and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District, the Schools being at Ashford, near Staines. For list of Guardians see Appendix No. VI. V. The School Board. In 1870 Paddington and the parishes of St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were formed into one of the Metropolitan Districts for the purposes of the Elementary Education Act (33 and 34 Victoria, cap. 75), under the name of the Marylebone Division of the School Board for London, which Division returns Seven Members to the School Board. For Managers of the Board Schools of the Marylebone Division see Appendix No. VII. 12 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. VI. Ecclesiastical Districts. Paddington is divided into Seventeen Ecclesiastical Districts, viz.:— St. James', St. Matthew's, St. Mary Magdalene, „ John's, „ Luke's, Westbourne „ Peter's, „ Mary's, Park, „ Stephen's, Holy Trinity, „ Saviour's, „ Augustine's, St. Paul's, „ Michael and All Angels, Emmanuel, All Saints', Christ Church, St. Luke's, Kilburn. VII. The County Council. By the Local Government Act of 1888, the Metropolitan Board of Works was superseded by the London County Council, and the area which had hitherto been under the control of the Metropolitan Board, was formed into the Administrative County of London, each Parliamentary Electoral Division returning double the number of Members to the Council to that returned to Parliament, so that Paddington has Four Members on the Council. The first election took place on 17th January, 188U, when the result was as follows:— North Paddington. Votes. R. Melvill Beachcroft (elected) 1,779 E. Parker Young (elected) 1,598 G. H. Maberly 1,170 Mark H. Judge 1,043 South Paddington. T. G. Fardell (elected) 1,631 Sir George Harris (elected) 1,362 A. E. Dobbs 1,283 Rev. J. M. Cox 213 Halford L. Mills 186 13 REPORT, 1888-9. VIII. Gas and Water Supply. The Gas consumed in Paddington is supplied by The Gas Light and Coke Company. The Water is supplied by two Companies, viz.:— the Grand Junction Waterworks Company and the West Middlesex Waterworks Company. Ratepayers residing on the Bishop of London's Estate are entitled to a deduction of 15 per cent. A plan of the Estate may be seen at the Vestry Hall. IX, Municipal Electoral Divisions. Paddington is divided into Four Wards, as follows, viz.:— WARD No. 1:— All that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of Harrow Road from the point at which the same intersects the boundary of the said Parish, and thence along the centre of such Road to a point directly opposite the centre of the Road on Westbourne Terrace Bridge, thence along the centre of such Road and of Westbourne Terrace, to the centre of Bishop's Road, thence Westward along the centre of Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the West boundary of the said Parish at the point where the same intersects the centre of Westbourne Grove, and thence Northward continuously along the said boundary to the point mentioned at the commencement of the foregoing description. WARD No. 2:— All that portion of the said Parish which lies North of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace to a point directly opposite the West end of the centre of Craven Road, thence along the centre of Craven Road and Praed Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. 14 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. WARD No. 3:— All that portion of the said Parish which lies South of Ward No. I and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace, Sussex Gardens, and Westbourne Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. WARD No. 4 All that portion of the said Parish which is not comprised within the foregoing descriptions of the other Wards. For the purposes of Rate Collection, Ward No. 2 has been sub-divided as follows:— Ward No. 2a East:— All that portion of the Ward lying North of the canal and South of a line drawn through the centre of Sutherland Avenue from Harrow Road to Shirland Road, and East of a line drawn along the centre of Shirland Road from Sutherland Avenue to Kilburn Park Road. Ward No. 2a West:— All that portion of the Ward lying North of a line drawn along the centre of Sutherland Avenue from Harrow Road to Shirland Road, and West of a line drawn along the centre of Shirland Road from Sutherland Avenue to Kilburn Park Road. Ward No. 2b:— All that portion of the Ward lying South of the line of the Grand Junction and Regent Canals from Maida Vale to Lock Bridge, Harrow Road. X. Population. The population of Paddington, at the Census taken in 1881, was as follows, viz.:— Ward No. 2 45,879 North Paddington. „ „ 1 27,921 „ „ 3 17,918 }South Paddington. „ „ 4 15,500 Making a total of 107,218 In 1881 the number of inhabited houses was 13,231. 15 REPORT, 1888-9. XI. The Vestry. In 1855 the Vestry of Paddington was reconstituted as the Local Authority of the Parish by the Metropolis Local Management Act (18 and 19 Victoria, cap. 120). The Vestry is the Board of Works for Paddington, and consists of Seventy-two Elected Members and the Vicar of Paddington, who is ex-officio Chairman of the Vestry. The ordinary meetings of the Vestry are held at the Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, Paddington Green, on the first and third Tuesdays in each month, the third Tuesday in August and the first Tuesday in September excepted. In 1852 the Vestry resolved to erect a new building for the Municipal purposes of the Parish, and in 1853 the Vestry Hall in the Harrow Road was opened. XII. The Burial Board. In 1854 the Paddington Cemetery, which is situated in the parish of Willesden, was purchased by the Parish. It is managed by a Burial Board, consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Vestry. The ordinary meetings of the Burial Board are held at the Vestry Hall on the first Thursday in each month. For Members of the Burial Board and Statement of Accounts see Section XXII. XIII. The Baths and Wash-houses. In 1871 Paddington adopted the Baths and Wash-houses Act (9 and 10 Victoria, cap. 74), and the Baths and Wash-houses erected in the Queen's Road, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145 were opened to the public in 1874. The Baths and Wash-houses are under the management of Seven Commissioners appointed by the Vestry. For Commissioners of Baths and Wash-houses and Report and Statement of Accounts see Section XXIII. 16 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. XIV. The Parochial Charities. There are certain charities under the control of the Vestry, managed by Trustees appointed by the Vestry and the Charity Commissioners. These Charities have an annual income of over Two Thousand Pounds, which is yearly distributed to the Poor in Coals and Blankets, in Grants to the Parochial National Schools, in apprenticing sons and daughters of poor parishioners, and in Annuities to aged persons resident in the Parish, &c. For the Schedule of the Charities, with names of Trustees' &c., see Section XXIV. For the Accounts of the Charities see Section XXV. XV.

The following Report on the Paving, Sewers, Lighting, and other works carried out during the year ending March 25th, 1889, was submitted to the Vestry by the Surveyor, Mr. George Weston, and ordered to be included in the Annual Report of the Vestry:— Vestry Hall, Paddington, June 29th, 1889. To the Vestry of Paddington. Gentlemen, I herewith submit my Annual Report of the various works that have been executed during the year ending Lady-day, 1889, and other matters incidental thereto.

Carriageway Paving, New and Re-laid. The paving of Bathurst Mews being in a very defective condition, was taken up and re-laid with re-dressed Aberdeen Granite Cubes, which were purchased from Messrs. Nowell and Kobson at a reduced price. The following return will give an account of the extent of this class of work executed during the year:— £ s. d. Bathurst Mews 2,179½ yds. super. 878 19 9 Upper Brook Mews 1,247½ „ 470 19 8 Brook Mews North, in Entrance 91½ „ 30 18 2 Shirland Road, by Malvern Road (New Crossing) 30½ „ 14 19 2 £1,395 16 9 Reinstating Roads and Footpaths after Companies, &c. The reinstating of roads and footpaths after Gas and Water Companies and Postal Authorities have been unusually heavy this year, especially owing to the Gas Light and Coke Company taking up several miles of old mains, and replacing same with new pipes of a larger diameter. The whole of these expenses, amounting to £1,842 13s. 7d., have been repaid to the Vestry. Maintenance of Channels and Footways. The general repairs and renewals to flagged footways, crossings, and channels throughout the Parish, 24 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. also the restoring of all disturbed places consequent upon new services for Gas and Water Companies drains, scaffolding, and hoardings, have been carried out by the Vestry's staff of workmen. One mile, one furlong, and 191 yards lineal of old footways have been thus treated, 7,216 yards super of wood paving renewed, and 1,223 yards super of channel and carriageway paving re-laid. The Vestry's power under the 105th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act has been carried out in Tamplin Mews. The total length of roadways under the Vestry's maintenance is 49 miles, six furlongs, and 198 yards. £ s. d.

Harrow Road and Paddington Tramways. The Company commenced to break up the roadway and lay their rails from the Southern end of Chippenham Road, and in the Harrow Road at the Western Boundary of the Parish in the early part of March, 1888, and the works were completed so far as this Parish was concerned in June of that year. On the 2nd July, Major-General C. L. Hutchinson, R.E., reported to the Board of Trade that he had inspected the line, and recommended them to certify that the Tramways were fit for public traffic. It is needless for me to record in this report the numerous meetings which occupied the attention of the Vestry during the latter end of the year 1888, with reference to wood paving the sides of the tramway, and which was finally decided to be carried out. The Company have again applied to Parliament for an extension of the Tramway from the Lock Bridge to the junction of Edgware Road, and also from Cambridge Road to the Eastern end of Kilburn Park Road, thence to Cricklewood. New Servers Works. Three hundred and forty feet run of brick sewer, of the capacity of 3' 9" x 2' 6", together with a side entrance and air openings, have been constructed in Bradiston Road, between Fernhead Road and Saltram Crescent, by and at the cost of Mr. E. Vigors. Houses 26 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. are now in course of erection in this street, and the pipe drains therefrom will have separate outlets into the sewer. [n Harrow Road, between Westbourne Park Crescent and Cottage Road, the Vestry has recently constructed a brick sewer, four hundred and twentyone feet in length, and of the capacity of 3' 9" x 2' 6", at a cost of £726 3s. 6d., for the drainage from houses in late Westbourne Villas, which had hitherto drained into large brick cesspools in the gardens at the rear of the houses, and having combined outlets into an 18" brick sewer under the permanent way of the Great Western Railway. The gulley drains from roadwa)r, which were connected with the cesspools, are now drained into the new sewer. The sewer is also available for the drainage of houses on the North side of this portion of the Harrow Road, which at present have combined pipe drainage along the back yards of the houses, and have often been found in a defective condition. The total lengtli of sewers under the jurisdiction of the Vestry is 53 miles, six furlongs, and 80 yards. In Moscow Road a man-hole entrance to sewer has been constructed, thereby very materially improving the means of access to sewers in the locality, the expense having been £25 7s. 2d. In consequence of complaints having been received of bad smells arising from the defectively-ventilated 27 REPORT, 1888-9. sewer in Upper Brook Mews, and the failure to obtain permission to erect a ventilating shaft therefrom in rear of premises in Chilworth Street, it was ultimately considered advisable to ventilate the sewer by means of 9" stoneware pipes, from the head wall of the sewer at the North-West end of the Mews, into a ventilating ' O shaft constructed in the centre of roadway in Chilworth Street, which work has been carried out at a cost of £20 3s. 6d. The late Metropolitan Board of Works have had a Sewer Gas Destructor fixed at the West corner of Chichester Place and Harrow Road, for the better ventilation of the Ranelagh Sewer in that immediate neighbourhood, thereby enabling them to remove a large iron ventilating grating, which they had fixed over the sewer in close proximity to houses on the West side of Chichester Place, and from which it was alleged bad smells emanated, and caused serious complaints to be made to the Vestry from inhabitants of that street. For some years past the sewer in Hampden Street was considered to be in a defective and insanitary condition, and in order to remedy these defects the Vestry passed a resolution in December last that works of improvement should be effected. Since then the joints of the brickwork of side walls and invert of sewer have been repointed in cement, the mouths of the disused house and gulley drains have been bricked 28 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. up, the untrapped drain outlets trapped, one ventilating shaft closed and another re-constructed for a man-hole entrance, and a "Keeling's" Sewer Gas Destructor fixed over sewer at the West end of the street, which has caused a decided improvement in the ventilation of the sewer. I am of opinion that there would be an improvement in the drainage of the houses in this street if a better water supply could be stored in cisterns and placed in more suitable positions than those at present in use, both for household purposes and for the flushing of the house drains. Drains, &c. Stoppages of drains from premises in the Queen's Road have been of frequent occurrence, in consequence of the high level pipe sewers with which they are connected having been found sunk and broken in. Recently a serious obstruction occurred in the drains from the Sovereign Brewery in this road from this cause, the expense to the Vestry in re-constructing a portion of the pipe sewer and the drain from the above premises amounted to £62 5s. 1d. The drainage works to houses in Maida Vale, and the filling-in of the old barrel sewer at the rear of same, have been completed, and the new drains connected with the main sewer in Maida Vale. A considerable number of gulley drains have been specially constructed for the surface drainage of new 29 REPORT, 1888-9. roads taken to by the Vestry under the Metropolis Local Management Acts, and the cost of construction charged to the owners of property in such localities. Other gulley drains in different parts of the Parish, which were defective, have been re-constructed and repaired as circumstances required, those re-constructed numbering 35, and those repaired 40. New pipe drains have been constructed from sewers to urinals in Conduit Place and Oliver Mews, at a cost of £31 8s. 9d. Eighty-nine applications have been received from time to time to have old house drains re-constructed, which upon inspection were found either broken in under roadways or otherwise defective, or where it was considered advisable to have new drains laid in improved positions to that of the old ones. These works have been carried out by the Vestry's Contractor at the cost of the applicants. The Sewers Jobbing Works executed this year include the completion of the drainage works ordered by the Vestry to be carried out to the houses on the AVest side of Maida Vale, also the drainage works under roadways from houses and other buildings in various parts of the Parish. The construction and re-construction of sandpits and gulley drains in streets, and providing and fixing stoneware block flap-traps at their outlets, also at the outlets of house drains. 30 BOROUGH OF 1'ADUINGTON. The total amount expended for these works is £2,351 17s. 1d. The sum of £704 14s. 4d. has been paid to the Accountant on behalf of the Vestry for drainage works executed for various applicants, including the Gas Light and Coke Company, the Grand Junction Water Works Company, and the Tramway Company, which sum is included in the above total amount of Sewers Jobbing Works. Numerous complaints have been received from Parishioners and others respecting the unsatisfactory condition of their house drains, either from faulty construction when the houses were built or want of improved sanitary appliances. In many cases the* cause of complaint has arisen on account of the drains being obstructed or untrapped, thereby allowing an escape of sewage matter by percolation, also bad smells to pervade the interior of the dwellings. This at times lias caused serious illness to the occupiers. Where stoppages in drains have occurred, they have been quickly removed, where possible to do so, by the use of drain-rods from the sewer, and in the case of other defects they have been remedied by re-construction and the untrapped outlets cffieicntly trapped. One hundred and twenty-five examinations have been made from those sewers, which enable the Vestry s workmen to ascertain the condition of the 31 REPORT, 1888-9. above-mentioned drains, and report to the Surveyors Department the result of such examinations, and for which the sum of £25 has been paid to the Vestry. The sanitary condition of the small brick and pipe sewers have received the required attention, and as often as necessary been flushed with water, in order to remove foul deposits therefrom. In the brick sewers, where heavy deposits had • accumulated, principally from the debris of the roadways, which in a fluid condition found its way into the sewers through the gulley drains during heavy rainfall, have been removed by the Vestry's sewer men. The quantity so removed and carted away amounted to one hundred and thirty-five loads. The catchpits of the street gulleys act very beneficially as the means of keeping a large quantity of the road slop from entering the sewers, when in not too fluid a state. The pits are daily examined, and the deposits in them taken out by the workmen engaged solely for the purpose, and carted away. Seventeen hundred and eight loads have been removed from the pits, which necessitated 33,377 separate removals therefrom. The public urinals, which are daily flushed and cleansed with water, are situate in the following streets of the Parish, viz.:— Paddington Green, North Wharf Road, 32 BOROUGH OP PADDINGTON. South Wharf Road (by Pracd Street), London Street, Conduit Place, Bayswater Road (by Queen's Road), Pickering Placc, Westbourne Park Road, Harrow Road (by Blomficld Crescent), Marlborough Street (by Westbourne Park Passage), Oliver Mews. New Buildings. During the year the Vestry have received notices for the erection of one hundred and fifteen houses, also for the erection of large stable buildings in Lanhill Koad, on the premises of Messrs. Welford and Cu., and stabling in the rear of the " Swan" publichouse, in the liayswater Koad. These noticcs were required in accordance with the 7Gth Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. Plans shewing the proposed drainage of the buildings have also been received, and the Vestry passed orders with reference thereto ; and copies of such orders have been served upon the parties concerned. The lineal extent of stoneware pipes required to drain the above-mentioned buildings, as shewn 011 submitted plans, is about 4,268 yards. These drains are tested with water by the Vestry's officials prior to the trenches being filled in, and, if found satisfactory, are passed in the usual manner. 33 REPORT, 1888-9. Re-naming Streets and Re-numbering Houses. The following Order of the Metropolitan Board of Works has been carried out, viz.:— Date of Order. Locality. Subsidiary Name abolished. No. of Houses in street. 1888. April 20 Carlton Terrace. - Sixhouses only renumbered. The numbers of the other houses in Street were correct. LIGHTING. This is now the fifteenth year since the Average Meter System as applied to Public Lighting was introduced, There are 1,982 lamps, each lamp is estimated to consume 4.6 cubic feet of gas per hour, and to be alight for 3,866 hours during the year, or an average of 10.54 hours per night. The estimated consumption of gas per lamp per annum is 17,787 cubic feet. There are 98 meters attached to the public lamps. 34 BOROUGH OF PADD1NGT0N. Refuge Lamps. —The position, power, and number of these lamps will be found in the accompanying return. [Appendix No. II] One additional lamp has been erected during the year. Price of Gas.—The Gas Light and Coke Company's charge is 2s. 2d. per 1,000 cubic feet for gas supplied for public lighting purposes. Defective Services.—During the year 12G notices were sent to the Gas Company for the rectification of defective services, which they promptly attended to and at their own expense. Damages to Lamp-posts.—During the year nine lamp-posts were knocked down, 22 columns broken, 19 head-irons and 14 lanterns damaged by various parties, through accidents or carelessness, the restoration being made good by the Vestry's workmen in 12 cases at the expense of those causing the damage, and in 17 cases they escaped detection. Other information in a tabular form in connection with the working of this Department will be found in Appendix No. II. Dusting. The number of loads of rough Dust collected has been 20,200, and 4,5GG horses employed: the daily average number of loads 67.07, or 4.43 loads per horse per working day. The following miscellaneous 35 REPORT, 1888-9. materials and quantities have been abstracted from the before-mentioned number of loads:— 16 tons of Coals, 62 cart loads and 19 boat loads of Hard Core, 3,541 tons or 189 boat loads of Garbage or Soft Core, 611 tons of Bones, 100 tons of Rags, 58 tons 2 cwt. of old Iron, 3f tons of various Metals, 13 tons of white Glass. There has been sorted and sifted 17,509 chaldrons of Ashes and 8,616 chaldrons of Breeze; of this quantity, 15,359 chaldrons of Ashes and 6,637 chaldrons of Breeze were sent away by boats, and 2,150 chaldrons of Ashes and 1,979 chaldrons of Breeze have been removed by purchasers' carts. The early part of the year was very unfavourable for selling the Ashes and Breeze, but towards the end of the autumn prices advanced a little, and I am in hopes better prices will be obtained during the next season. Slopping. The contract for the removal of the dry Sweepings, Slop, Scrapings, and Snow taken off the public highways was let to Messrs. Mead & Co., at Is. 4d. per ton. This amount included the expenses of tonnage, haulage, and the use of a shoot. The number of loads thus sent away was 24,026. The maximum number of loads collected in one week beino; 527 and the minimum 257, or a daily average throughout the year of 61'92 loads, 6,898 horses, vans, and carts being employed in the collecting. 36 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. Carting Roadway Materials and General Work. On this class of work, 2,344 horses and carts have been engaged 303 days, giving an average of 7*73 per day. Cleansing the Public Streets. The principal main roads and all wood paved roads are swept, daily, other roads two or three times weekly, or oftencr as occasion requires, and periodically some of the wood paved roads are washed and cleansed. Sanding Frosty Roads. Whenever the surfacc of the roads required sanding, men, horses, and sanding machines were sent out late at night and early in the morning. During the year 436 horses, carts and machines were out on 85 occasions, and 500 cubic yards of Shingle being thus distributed. Road Watering. During the season the water vans were out 110 days, 4,375 horses and vans being employed, giving an average of 39.79 per day.

The Commissioners for Public Baths and Washhouses Accountsfor the Parish of Paddington, in submitting their Statement of Accounts for the year ending 25th March, 1889, certified by Messrs. Wilde & Venables, Chartered Accountants, and duly audited by three of the Parochial Auditors, beg to report as follows The result of the year's working has unfortunately shown a falling off in the receipts, as compared with last year, of £380 2s. id. During the twelve months, the Commissioners have cleared off the Liabilities due at the end of the previous year, viz. :—£1,025 175. 3d. (including £56 11s. 8d. for Water, supplied up to Christmas, 1887, and £400 borrowed from the London and County Banking Company). In order to effect this, they had to apply to the Vestry on the 17th December, 1888, for an advance of £500. They however feel confident, that had the weather been favourable, they would have been able to meet even these outstanding liabilities without making such an application. The Commissioners have further been compelled to expend the sum of £40 15s. od. in payment of damages and costs in an action commenced on the 22nd March, 1888, by an employe of a former contractor for Coke, for injuries received through the alleged negligence of the Commissioners, which they, through the death of the material witness before the case came on for trial, were unable to properly defend 72 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. No. of Bathers, Comparative Statements of The comparative Statement of the number of Bathers during the past three years, is as follows:— March, 1887 189,286 „ 1888 182,773 „ 1889 165,531 The great diminution in the number during the past financial year, is in a great measure attributable to the wet and cold summer which has prejudicially affected the attendance of bathers, especially in the Swimming Baths, and this has further been enhanced by the opening of the public baths at Kensington. The numbers admitted to the Paddington Swimming Baths for the past three years having been To March, 1887 Men 85,388 Women 11,500 96,888 To March, 1888 Men82,156 Women 10,695 92,851 To March, 1889 Men68,164 Women 9,084 77,248 The Washhouses The Laundry has been well frequented throughout the year and the Commissioners believe that it is now used to a larger extent than ever, by the class for whom such Establishments were originally intended, that is, by those of the working population who do not possess conveniences for washing in their own homes. The Commissioners are about to erect eight additional troughs and drying horses, to meet the requirements of persons using the Laundry. During the past financial year, in order to place the Baths and Washhouses in thorough repair, additional men have been engaged. The renovations have been completed, and the building is now in a perfectly efficient state. The cost of this, in addition to the amount of £333 12s. od. shown for REPORT, 1888-89. 73 building charges, has been £147 5s. iod., which latter sum is included in the £1,377 4s. 7d. paid for "Wages to Fitter, &c." On the 14th May, 1888, the Commissioners appointed Mr. H. G. Holland, as their Clerk, and Mr. and Mrs. Wrapson (the former having previously been in their service for fourteen years as Engineer) as Superintendent and Matron, and an agreement has been entered into with them, and a policy of guarantee in the sum of £300 obtained from the Provident Clerks' Guarantee Association, for the faithful performance of the duties of Superintendent. On the 16th July, 1888, the Commissioners resolved to admit children attending Board Schools at reduced rates to the Swimming Baths, and they have, and are still prepared to favourably consider applications for a reduction in the price of admission from the managers of other Schools and Institutions : it being understood that bathers admitted at reduced rates, are limited to such days and hours when the Establishment is not used to the fullest extent by the general public. On the 20th July last, a fire occurred in the Laundry, causing slight damage to the building and destroying some of the towels, but this loss was met by the payment of £9 by the Royal Insurance Company. The Commissioners during the year have arranged for the letting of three rooms on the first floor in addition to the large Hall. The Conditions of letting being as follows :— 1.—All applications for the use of the Hall, or the Rooms above, must be made in writing to the Commissioners. 2.—All charges to be paid at the time of hiring, and no engagements will be booked until payment has been made to the Superintendent. No Appointment of Officers Reduced Rates for Board School Children. Conditions of Letting Hall and Rooms. 74 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. receipts are valid that are not on the printed forms of the Commissioners, and signed by the Superintendent or Clerk. If extra rooms beyond those defined at the time of hiring are required, application must be made to the Superintendent, who may in his discretion grant the use and fix the price for such rooms on the Commissioners' behalf. 3.—The Commissioners (seven in number) reserve to themselves and the Superintendent of the Baths, the right of entry to all parts of the building at all times, and require that instructions be given for their admission. 4.—No announcements to be made as to objects of hiring until such hiring has been definitely concluded, as mentioned in Clause 2. No money must be taken at the doors. 5.—In the event of any damage to the Building or Furniture on the part of the hirer, the expense of making good the same will be charged to the person named on this printed agreement as the hirer. 6.—No hirer of the Hall, or Rooms, or any one on his behalf, or by his permission, or any person whatsoever, shall sell Excisable Liquors therein, nor shall Smoking be permitted. 7.—No decorations whatever will be allowed (internally or externally), nor alterations in the arrangements of the Rooms, without the sanction of the Commissioners. 8.—Should the Commissioners consider it necessary, one or more policemen will be engaged at the expense of the hirer. REPORT, 1888-89. 75 9-—The Cloak-rooms : A charge of 7s. 6d. for each room will be made for the use of them. 10.—The Commissioners reserve to themselves the right to cancel any engagement which they afterwards find will be detrimental to the Letting of the Hall or Rooms. Under these regulations no spirituous liquors have been allowed to be sold during the year by persons renting the Hall or Rooms. This has probably caused a small falling off in the takings, which have been £153 75- 11d. as compared with £175 is. 6d. in 1887-8, but is an improvement on 1886-7, when they only amounted to £108 3s. od. The largest room on the first floor has been let since the 15th October, 1888, as an Art School in connection with the Government Department of Science and Art, South Kensington, under the supervision of Mr. W. S. Duncan, M.A.I. Certificated Art and Science Master; the Commissioners consider this is likely to prove a boon to the residents in Paddington. On the 25th February, 1889, the Commissioners made arrangements for the letting of the piece of vacant land at the rear of the Washhouses in Douglas Place, to Mr. William Whiteley for a term, at an annual rent of £g6, the tenancy to be terminable by a quarter's notice on either side.

The Vestry having decided to improve the Churchyard attached to St. Mary's Church, the necessary Faculty was obtained, and the Churchyard laid out as a public garden, at the cost of the Vestry. XXVIII. Electric Lighting. The question of Electric Lighting still continues to occupy attention, and Reports by two experts, Professor Gr. Forbes, F.R.S., and Mr. S. Gr. Mackie, have been obtained. Pending the full consideration of the subject it was decided to oppose all applications for Provisional Orders or Licenses for 1889. The whole subject of the Electric Lighting of the Parish, is in the hands of the Electric Lighting Committee, consisting of 48 members, who are preparing a Report for the consideration of the Vestry. XXIX. Measures before Parliament. Among: the Bills introduced into Parliament during the year, the following have received attention by the Vestry:— Fire Brigade Expenses. Metropolitan Board of Works (Local Management). School Board Election. United Telephone Company. London Coal and Wine Dues Continuance. Local Government (England and Wales). Metropolitan Board of Works (Regulation of Iheatres). Personal Property (Exemption from Sale). 108 BOROUGH OF PAPDINGTON. Advertising Stations (Rating). Bribery and Corruption. School Board for London (Pensions) Bill. The action taken on some of these measures may be noted as follows:— School Board Election Bill. A Conference of Representatives from several Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards of Works convened by the Paddington Vestry, was held at the Paddington Vestry Hall, Mr. Mark H. Judge in the Chair, on Wednesday, April 18th, 1888. The following resolutions were passed:— "That the most convenient area for School Board electoral purposes in the Metropolis would be the Parliamentary divisions." "That each electoral division should have one member, with the exception of the City, which should have two members." "That the cumulative system of voting at School Board Elections should be abolished." "That casual vacancies occurring on the School Board should be filled up by a vote of the Ratepayers, and not as at present by the members of such Board." "That a Returning Officer should be appointed for each School Board Division, and that the office of Returning Officer for the whole of the Metropolis should be abolished." "That all expenses for School Board Election purposes, paid for out of the rates, should be subject to revision, by taxation or otherwise." "That the Resolutions which have been passed by the Conference be forwarded to the Members of Her Majesty's Government, the Metropolitan Members of Parliament, the School Board for London, and the several Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, with a letter requesting them to support such amendments in the School Board Election Bill as will give effect to the Resolutions of the Conference." REPORT, 1888-9. 109 "that the Education Department be asked to receive a Deputation from the Conference; that all Representatives appointed to the conference be invited to attend the Deputation; and that a further Meeting of the Conference be convened an hour previous to the Deputation waiting upon the Education Department." The Bill was withdrawn and no further action taken thereon. Local Government Bill. A Conference of Representatives from Vestries and District Boards was convened by the Paddington Vestry, and held at St. James's Hall on Wednesday, July 11th, 1888, Sir George D. Harris in the Chair. The following resolutions were passed :— 1.— The Electoral Divisions. "That in the opinion of this Conference it is most desirable that the division of the Metropolis into Districts should be the same for Parliamentary and Municipal Elections, and that the Local Government Bill should provide for this by enacting that the Parliamentary Divisions shall also be made the Municipal Divisions for Electoral purposes." 2. — Number of Councillors. "That in order that all important interests may be represented on the London County Council, and that its manifold duties may be properly attended to, it is necessary that the Council should be much larger than the Metropolitan Board of Works, and therefore this Conference is of opinion that each Division now electing one Member of Parliament, should be given Three representatives on the County Council, and that the City should be given .Six representatives." 110 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. 3.— Election of Councillors. "That in the opinion of the Conference one-third of the members of the London County Council should retire annually, but be eligible for re-election. 4.— Aldermen. "That in the opinion of the Conference the selection of Councillors is unnecessary and undesirable, and further, is objectionable in principle, inasmuch as it encroaches upon the system of direct popular representation; but that in any case the number of selected Councillors should not exceed one-tenth of those elected." 5. — The Question of Bribery. "That a clause should be introduced into the Local Government Bill making it a penal offence for an officer or member of any authority constituted by the Act, to receive any fee or reward by way of commission or bribe; also that the person offering or giving such fee or reward shall be guilty of a like offence.'' 6.— Future Action of the Conference. That an Executive Committee be formed, consisting of the Chairman of the Conference and one Member of each Vestry or Board represented; such Members to be nominated by the representatives of their respective Vestries or Boards." "That the Resolutions adopted by the Conference be embodied in a Memorial for presentation to the Government; that the President of the Local Government Board be asked to receive a Deputation from the Conference in support of the Memorial; and that all the Metropolitan Members of Parliament and the Members of the Conference be invited to join the Deputation." The Memorial was forwarded to the Local Government Board, and the Bill was amended in several respects in the direction suggested by the Conference. REPORT, 1888-9. 111 Bribery and Corruption Bill. In July, 1888, the Vestry approved of the Resolution adopted by the Conference at St. James's Hall, and also agreed to Petition Parliament in support of the measure against Bribery, which was subsequently introduced by Lord Randolph Churchill, M.P. Such Petition was duly presented by Mr. John Aird, M.P. Advertising Stations (Bating) Bill. The Vestry passed a Resolution approving of the general principle of this Bill. XXX. Burial Board Inquiry. A Committee, consisting of Mr. Mark H. Judge (Chairman), Mr. S. Cole, Mr. G. H. Maberly, Mr. W. H. Mills, and Dr. Gr. D. Thomas, was appointed by the Vestry on 5th June, 1888, to make an investigation into the affairs of the Paddington Burial Board, especially with reference to the practice of paying commissions, which had recently been revived by that Board; and upon the presentation of the Report of the Committee to the Vestry in December last, the following resolution, included in the recommendations, was passed by the Vestry, viz.:— "That the practice of paying out of the Burial Fees, a commission, by way of discount to Undertakers, for bringing funerals to the Cemetery, is most objectionable in principle; derogatory to the proper administration of a Parochial Burial place; adds to 112 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. the cost of burial; brings about an unseemly rivalry between Parochial Boards; is contrary to the spirit of the Acts under which the Parishioners were taxed to purchase the ground; and should be at once abolished." Subsequently the Board discontinued the payment of these commissions. XXXI. Water Charges for Road-watering. In May, 1888, an application was made by the Paddington Vestry to the Marylebone Police Court, under the Waterworks Clauses Act, requesting that the charge of the West Middlesex Waterworks Company (9d. per 1,000 gallons) should be reduced. Mr. De Rutzen, the presiding Magistrate, favourably considered the application, and reduced the cost of supply from 9d. to 8½d. per 1,000 gallons, the Vestry to take the usual allowance in the way of per-centage. The Magistrate declined to fix the term for the payment of the 8½d., expressing a hope that the Company would be able to make a further reduction. XXXII. Parochial Accounts. A Committee, consisting of Mr. W. H. Mills (Chairman), Col. C. H. Barchard, C.B., Mr. M. P. Beverly, Mr. J. Farmer, J P., Mr. N. A. Jephson, Mr. Mark 11. Judge, Mr. C. A. Stephenson, Mr. W. Urquliart, and Mr. J. Williams, was appointed by the Vestry on 5th June, 1888, to conside r and report whether any, and, if any, what alterations are desirable in the mode of keeping and auditing the REPORT, 1888-9. 113 Parochial Accounts, and of presenting the same to the Vestry. In February last a Report dealing with the General Banking Account; Highway and Works Department Banking Accounts; Making and Collection of Rates; The Vestry Accounts of the several Departments; and other matters, was submitted to the Vestry. On 2nd April, 1889, the Vestry postponed the consideration of this Report until the first Vestry Meeting in October next. XXXIII. Registration Acts. Several persons having failed to furnish returns of Inhabitant Occupiers as required by these Acts, the Solicitor, on the 20th November last, was instructed to take proceedings, in a test case, for non-compliance with the provisions of the Acts. A summons was accordingly taken out, but the service of the notice at the Office of the Defendant by the Collector was held not to be good. The summons was withdrawn, but the Defendant undertook to fill up the forms in future. XXXIV. Meetings of the Vestry and its Committees. During the year ending March 25th, 1889, 33 Meetings of the Vestry have been held. 114 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. Of the Standing Committees there have been Meetings as follow:— Committees.

XXXVI. Printing of Minutes. On May 21st, the vestry passed the following resolution: — "That the Minutes of this and future Meetings of the Vestry, "up to and including the last Meeting to be held in the year 1889, "be printed (in foolscap form), and copies supplied to the Members "of the Vestry, at least three days prior to the Meeting at which "such Minutes are to be signed; that the Vestry Clerk do report "to the Vestry, at the first Ordinary Meeting of the Vestry in "December next, the cost of such printing to date; and that at "the said Meeting the Vestry do re-consider the whole question "with a view to the passing of a new Bye-Law, if it should be "decided to continue the printing of the Minutes. XXXVII. Preparation of the Annual Report. This Report was prepared under the direction of a Committee, appointed by the vestry in June, 1889. The following is the section of the Metropolis 116 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. Local Management Act of 1855 (18 & 19 vic., cap. 120), under which it is published, viz.:— 198 "Every such Vestry as aforesaid and District Board shall, in the month of June in every year, cause to be printed the said account in abstract and summary statement for the preceding year, relating to such Vestry or Board, and also make and cause to be printed therewith a report of their proceedings in the execution of this Act, and of the works commenced and completed respectively in the preceding year by such Vestry or Board, and the works remaining in progress at the termination of such year, and also of any proceedings taken by them or under their authority in the preceding year in pursuance of any regulations of the general Board of Health for the time being in force, or otherwise, for the removal of nuisances or the improvement of the sanitary condition of their parish or district; and to every such report there shall be appended a copy of every report made to such Vestry or Board during the preceding year by the officer or officers of health for their parish or district; and every such Vestry and Board shall in the said month of June send a copy of every such account in abstract, statement, and report, together with a printed list of the names and addresses of the members of such Vestry and Board, and of their officers, to the Metropolitan Board of works [now London County Council]; and every vestry and District Board shall permit REPORT, 1888-9. 117 inspection at their office of a copy of any such account in abstract, statement, and report by any ratepayer in their parish or district, without payment, at all reasonable times, and shall also permit the. like inspection by the public generally of such list of officers; and copies of such account in abstract, statement, and report, and list of officers, shall be delivered to any person applying for the same, on payment of such reasonable sums, not exceeding 2d. for each such copy, as may be fixed by such vestry or Board in this behalf."

SANITARY REPORT For the Year 1888. BY JAMES STEVENSON, M.D. Medical Officer of Health. Borough of Paddington. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year 1888. To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the following Report on the Health of the Parish of Paddington during the Year 1888:— Births and Deaths. During the fifty-two weeks of the registration year ending 29th December, 1888, 2,843 births, and 2,142 deaths were registered in Paddington. 122 Births. Of the 2,843 births, comprising 1,438 male and 1,405 female children, 2,331 occurred in St. Mary's, and 502 in St. John's Sub-district. The proportion of males to females among the children born in the Parish was 100 males to 98 females, whereas in the Metropolis it was 100 males to 97 females. The births were most numerous during the first and least so in the second quarter of the year. The ratio of births to the entire population of the Parish was 1 to every 41 inhabitants, or 24.6 per 1,000 inhabitants of all ages. In St. Mary's Sub-district the ratio of births to the population was 1 in every 34 inhabitants, or 29.5 per 1,000 living. In St. John's the ratio of births to population was 1 to 72, or 13.9 per 1,000 inhabitants. Some of the preceding particulars are shown in the subjoined table:— Sub-Distrcts. Estimated Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000. St. Mary's 78,939 2,331 1 to 34 29.5 St. John's 36,810 512 1 to 72 13.9 Paddington 115,749 2,843 1 to 41 24.6 The Birth-rate for London was 30.7 per 1,000 „ „ England & Wales was 31.2 „ 123 Deaths. The total number of deaths registered in Paddington during the year was 2,142. Of this number, 255 were of non-parishioners who died in St. Mary's Hospital, 46 were of non-parishioners who died in the Children's Hospital, and 3 were of non-parishioners who died in the Lock Hospital, making a total of 304 non-parishioners who died in the parish. Deducting these non-parishioners, it will be seen that 1,838 parishioners died actually in Paddington. To this number must be added the deaths of 78 parishioners in extra-parochial hospitals and public institutions, making a corrected total of 1,916—906 males and 1,010 females—equivalent to an annual death-rate of 16.6 per 1,000 inhabitants. The natural increase of population from the excess of births over deaths was 927 as compared with 1,131 in the previous year. Of the 1,916 deaths, 1,472 occurred in St. Mary's and 444 in St. John's Sub-district. The deaths in St. Mary'a include 81—40 males and 41 females—in the Workhouse, and 126—72 males and 54 females in the Paddington Infirmary. The deaths were most numerous during the first, and least so in the second quarter of the year. The following table shows the ratio of deaths to the population, together with the death-rate per 1,000 124 of the population of the parish and of its two Sub- districts:— Sub-Districts. Estimated Population. Deaths. Ratio of Deaths to Population. Death Rate per 1,000.

The death-rate from all causes in each one of the five groups of districts into which London is divided is shown as under:— Per 1,000 Inkabitants. North Districts 16.4 West „ 18.9 South „ 17.3 East „ 21.1 Central „ 27.2 125 The subjoined figures showing the number of deaths from all causes in Paddington during each of the last ten years may be more intelligible to some than if expressed in the form of a death-rate:— Years. No. of Deaths. 1879 1,939 1880 1,667 1881 1,679 1882 1,766 1883 1,762 1884 1,802 1885 1,877 1886 1,909 1887 1,785 1888 1,916 When considering these figures, not only must the annual increase of population (averaging more than 1,000 a year) be borne in mind, but also the fact that since 1885 the deaths of parishioners in out-lying Public Institutions have been included. The 78 deaths of parishioners—59 from St. Mary's Sub-District and 19 from St. John's —which occurred in 1888 in the following extra-Parochial Hospitals and Institutions, are throughout this Report dealt with in the same manner as if they had actually taken place in the Parish, and are assigned in the Tables to the Subdistricts from which the deceased were admitted:— 126 Hospitals and Institutions. Deaths. Hospitals and Institutions. Deaths.

The rate of infantile mortality in Paddington was 133 per 1,000 registered births. In London the rate was 146, and in the 27 largest provincial towns it ranged from 123 in Bristol to 200 in Leicester. In England and Wales it was 137. Zymotic Diseases. Small-pox caused 1 death in Paddington. The deceased had only two vaccination marks, both bad. No other case came under the notice of the Sanitary Department. In London 9 deaths occurred, being the lowest number on record since civil registration began. Measles caused 66 deaths—63 in St. Mary's, and 3 in St. John's Sub-district—equivalent to an annual rate of 0.57 per 1,000 inhabitants. In London the deaths from Measles were in the proportion of 0.56 to 1,000 inhabitants, the average annual rate in the preceding decennium having been 0.58. But, though the rate for the whole year was thus in London considerably below the average, there was in the latter part of the year a very serious outbreak, which began about the first week in October, and reached its maximum in the middle of December. 128 In Paddington the deaths were also in excess of the annual average for the preceding ten years, which had been 42, and, as in the rest of London, this excess occurred chiefly in the latter hall of the year. Scarlet Fever caused 14 deaths, as compared with an annual average of 31 in the preceding ten years. All occurred in St. Mary's Sub-district, and were equivalent to a rate of 0.12 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with 0.31 per 1,000 in the preceding year. Of the 14 deaths, 9 occurred in the first quarter of the year, 3 in the second, and 1 in each of the last two quarters. 92 cases were removed either to the Asylums Hospitals or to the London Fever Hospital—84 from St. Mary's and 8 from St. John's Sub-district. The greater mortality during the first three months of the year was due to the fact that the serious outbreak of Scarlet Fever in the Metropolis which marked the latter months of 1887 had not completely subsided until the end of March, 1888. In London the rate was 0.28 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with an average annual rate of 0.46. Diphtheria caused 75 deaths in Paddington, as compared with 27 in the preceding year, and with an annual average of 23 during the preceding decennium. The rate was 0.65 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared 129 with an annual average rate of 0.21 during the preceding decennium. 65 of the deaths occurred in St. Mary's Sub-district, and 10 in St. Johns. All the houses in which the deaths occurred were carefully inspected, attention being specially directed in each case to the condition of the water supply, and to the soundness of the house-drain as proved by the smoke test or the peppermint test. In the large majority of cases defects of some sort were discovered and made good. In London the rate was 0.30 per 1,000 inhabitants, and was not only greatly in excess of the decennial average rate, which was only 0.20, but was higher than in any single year since 1859. The increase in 1888, as compared with the preceding year, was especially marked in Paddington, Kensington, St. George's, Hanover Square, and Westminster, among the Western Districts. With the view of determining whether during the previous seven years (1881-87), Diphtheria had shown any tendency to be endemic in any streets or groups of streets in Paddington, and if so, whether the visitation from which the parish has been suffering during the past year has had any special fatality in the same streets or areas, I have prepared the following tables, which show the streets in which deaths from Diphtheria occurred in each Sub-district of the Parish in each quarter of the eight years, 1881-88 inclusive. 130 Careful consideration of the two Tables shows that Diphtheria has been present to an increased extent in Paddington since the beginning of 1888, for whereas the average annual number of deaths from Diphtheria during the seven years 1881-87 was 25, in 1888 the number was 75. The epidemic has so far been limited to the Subdistrict of St. Mary's, the number of deaths during the year being 67, against an annual average of 18 during the previous seven years; whereas in St. John's Subdistrict the number of deaths (8) corresponds closely with the annual average (7.3) for the previous seven years. To the first point of the enquiry, viz., whether during the seven years 1881-87 Diphtheria was endemic in any part of the Parish, the Tables give but little support. Excluding Hampden Street and Woodchester Street, in each of which the deaths were 6, in no street in the Parish did the deaths exceed, and only in 7 did the deaths reach 3, during the septennium, thus averaging less than 1 death in two years. And even in the case of Hampden Street and Woodchester Street, for three years out of the seven there were no deaths from Diphtheria. The streets in which 3 or more than 3 deaths occurred during the septennium 1881-87 were:— Clarendon Street 3 deaths. Brindley Street 3 „ Woodchester Street 6 „ Hampden Street 6 „ 131 Amberley Road 3 deaths. Blomfield Street 3 „ Thorngate Road 3 „ Portnall Road 3 „ Kilburn Park Road 3 „ Of these streets, the first five are situated together, and constitute one of the unhealthiest areas in the Parish, not merely in regard to the disease now under consideration, but in regard to all the zymotic diseases. With regard to the distribution of the disease during 1888, reference to the Tables will show that, with two exceptions, the disease did not show any special predilection for the streets most severely attacked during the septennium 1881-87. The streets in which 3 or more deaths from Diphtheria occurred in 1888 were:— Brindley Street 3 deaths. Hampden Street 7 „ Barnsdale Road 3 „ Marlboro' Street 3 „ Artesian Road 3 „ Woodfield Place 3 „ Sutherland Avenue 3 „ St. Stephen's Road 3 „ It will be seen that as during the septennium, so during 1888, Hampden Street has the worst record, and, further, that of the streets specially attacked during the septennial period, only Brindley Street and Hampden Street appear to have been severely attacked during 1888. 132 TABLE showing the STREETS in which DEATHS from DIPHTHERIA occurred in the Sub-District of St. Mary's in each Quarter of the Eight Years 1881-88 inclusive.

The deaths were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.64 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with an annual average rate of 0.50 during the preceding 10 years. In London the rate was 0.70 for 1888, and 0.78 for the decennium, 1878-87. Fever: 15 persons died from Typhoid Fever, 11 in St. Mary's and 4 in St. John's Sub-District. The annual average number of deaths from this disease during the preceding 10 years was 19. In London the number of deaths from this disease was far below the annual average. No death occurred in Paddington from Typhus Fever. Diarrhœa caused 38 deaths—giving a rate of 0.33 per 1,000 inhabitants. In London the rate was 0.52 per 1,000, and as in Paddington was far below the average rate. This low mortality was due to the unusually cold and wet weather that prevailed during July and August, the mean temperature in these two months being 2°8 Fahr. below the average in 117 years. The effect of a hot or cold summer upon the diarrhœa mortality is well shown by comparing the years 1887 and 1888, for neither the number nor the sanitary condition of the 139 population can have differed materially in these two consecutive years, which stood, however, widely apart in the matter of temperature. In 1887 the mean temperature of the third quarter was 61.0 Fahr., and the deaths in London in that quarter from Diarrhœa were 3200, while in 1888, the mean temperature was 57.6° and the Diarrhoea deaths only 1439. Disinfection. The disinfection of premises and of small articles of clothing and furniture is done without charge by the Sanitary Inspectors. Bedding, carpets, and large woollen fabrics belonging to the poor are cleansed and disinfected by Messrs. Armfield, at the cost of the Parish. During the year 122 cwt. was thus disinfected by that firm, involving an expenditure of £183 17s. 8d. A further sum of £22 12s. 1d. was paid for chemicals and carbolic soap, thus raising the cost incurred by the Sanitary Department for disinfection to the sum of £206 9s. 9d. Canal Basin. The Canal Basin was emptied on March 31st, and 600 tons of mud removed. No complaints regarding the condition of the Canal Basin were made to the Sanitary Department during 1888. 140 Water. Paddington is supplied with water by the Grand Junction and West Middlesex Companies, which draw their supplies from the Thames, as do also the Chelsea, the Lambeth, and the Southwark Companies. The remaining Metropolitan Water Companies are the Kent Company, whose water comes from the deep wells, and the New River Company, and East London Company, both of which derive their water from the River Lea. For the purposes of comparison, Professor Frankland in his annual report to the Registrar General on the condition of these waters during 1888, includes also the results of similar examinations of the water supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company, and the Tottenham Local Board of Health. He found that on the whole the water delivered by each of the above-named Companies, maintained, except in March, November, and December, the high quality exhibited for several years past. Temperature: Whilst the monthly variation in temperature is in the case of the river waters very great, the temperature of the deep well water is practically constant throughout the year. Thus the water derived from the Thames, and supplied by the Chelsea, West Middlesex, Southwark, Grand Junction, and Lambeth Companies, varied in temperature from 37°.4 in February, to 65°.3 in June. Again the water from the Lea distributed by the New River and East 141 London Companies fluctuated from 37°.8 in February, to 62°.6 in June; whilst the temperature of the deep well water delivered by the Kent Company, varied only between 53°.6 in February, to 56° .3 in August. This great uniformity of temperature which the water of the Kent Company possesses is of no little importance, as the water remains cool and refreshing in summer, and is less likely to become frozen in the service pipes in winter. The solid matters in water consist almost wholly of inorganic mineral substances, and to a very slight extent of organic material. The inorganic or mineral matters in the proportion in which they exist in the Metropolitan waters, in no way diminish their fitness for drinking. But the salts of lime and magnesia which constitute the principal part of these mineral ingredients are objectionable, both from causing that "hardness" of the water which renders it unsuitable for washing, and from producing incrustations and deposits in steam and kitchen boilers and hot water pipes. The deep well water from the chalk contains considerably more solid mineral matter than the river waters, and inasmuch as this chalk water is sent out in its natural condition by the Kent Company, and by the Tottenham Local Board of Health, these supplies contain more solid matter than any of the others. The Colne Valley Company on the other hand by treating this chalk water with lime before delivery, so reduces 142 the solid, matter, that the latter scarcely exceeds one half of that present in the river waters, and is but little more than one third of that in the deep well waters either of the Kent Company, or of the Tottenham Local Board of Health. The proportion of organic material which the solid matter invariably contains, is although very small, nevertheless of the greatest importance in connection with the use of the water for drinking purposes, for though insignificant in quantity, yet it may be of the most objectionable character on account of its origin. Thus the water, both of the Thames and the Lea, receives, above the points where it is abstracted for the purpose of the Metropolitan supply, various contributions of organic matter of animal origin, such as the drainage From manured land, the effluents from sewage works, and even raw sewage itself. This animal matter may at any time be accompanied by zymotic poisons dangerous to health, and although the chance of such substances reaching the water consumer is greatly reduced both by the filtration to which the water is subjected by the Companies, and by the care which is exercised in excluding the flood waters from their reservoirs, yet in spite of these protective measures there is no absolute guarantee that the noxious ingredients which may at any time be present, are wholly removed. Hence every encouragement should be given to the Companies in their efforts to improve the condition of their waters. Table A gives the proportion 143 of organic impurity present in the waters taken from the Thames, the Lea, and the deep wells respectively, from 1868 to 1888. From the figures there given, it will be seen that the Thames water supplied during the past year was, in respect of comparative freedom from organic impurity, only surpassed in two out of twenty-one years, that there was in the Lea Water a general freedom from organic matter, but that the highest degree of purity was shown last year as in former years by the deep well water, the average proportion of organic matter contained in it being but little more than one third of that present in the Thames, and slightly more than one half of that in the Lea water. It must be borne in mind also, that from a sanitary point of view, the superiority of this deep well water is not fully represented by a comparison of the analytical figures, for the exhaustive filtration which the deep well water undergoes in passing through a great depth of porous strata is far in excess of what can be effected by the sand filtration, highly valuable as it is to which the river waters are subjected. Table B shows the maximum, minimum and average proportions of organic impurity in each of the waters, the average amount contained in the Kent Company s water during the nine years ending December, 1876, being taken as unity. It appears from this table, that of the deep well waters, that supplied by the Kent Company contained 144 least organic matter, whilst of the river waters, that supplied by the New River Company was the best in this respect. The water sent out by the West Middlesex Company was conspicuous both by a higher maximum and a greater average of organic impurity. In Table C are recorded the results of observations respecting the freedom from turbidity, or otherwise, of the various waters, and for purposes of comparison, the results of similar observations made in 1868 are also included. From this Table it will be seen that every sample of river water was clear and bright when drawn from the mains. The contrast between the appearance of these river supplies in 1868, and that in 1888, is very striking, and affords the strongest evidence of the improvements which have been made in the methods of purification by the Companies. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Paddington, June, 1889. 145 TABLE A.
