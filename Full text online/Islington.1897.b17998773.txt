To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. Mary, Islington. Sir, Madam, and Gentlemen, It affords me great pleasure once more to present to you my Annual Report on the Health and Sanitary Condition of your great Parish, the more particularly as I have again to congratulate you on its extraordinary healthiness, a healthiness which I will venture to assert is not attained, at all events in the United Kingdom, by any Urban District with an equally large population. I desire to state here that I have been very pleased with the punctuality, the diligence, and the general conduct of the staff, Clerical and Inspectorial, of the Public Health Department, and that they have endeavoured so far as they could to help forward the sanitary work of the district. I must also acknowledge the assistance that Mr. J. R. Leggatt, the Superintendent and Chief Sanitary Inspector, has been to myself and to the Inspectors, and I would bring under your notice the careful manner in which he has made inquiries into the insanitary conditions existing on all the premises against whose owners legal proceedings were contemplated or taken. To Mr. G. H. King, Chief Clerk, I have to express my indebtedness for the skilled way in which he has prepared much of the statistics contained in this report, as well as in my Quarterly Returns, and for his very great willingness at all times to assist me in my Clerical Work. I am, Your obedient Servant, ALFRED E. HARRIS, Medical Officer of Health. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR THE YEAR 1897. AREA, POPULATION AND DENSITY OF ISLINGTON. Area,—The area of Islington is 3,109 acres, inclusive of canals and open spaces. In this report the divisions of the Sanitary District dealt with are the Sub-registration Districts and the Wards. Their acreage, their estimated populations and their densities are given in the two succeeding tables. Table I. Showing the Areas, Densities, and Estimated Populations of the Sub-registration Districts. Sub-Districts. Areas in Acres. Persons to an Acre. Acres to a Person.

Among the former, such towns as Hastings, Heading, Hanley, Worcester, Warrington, Darlington, Dudley, Hartlepool, Stockton and Coventry will readily occur to the mind, while among the latter may be included Woolwich, St. Saviour, Southwark, Westminster, St. James', Westminster, Clerkenwell, and St. Luke's. Of these the two latter alone are more densely populated. 9 [1897 St. Peter's is the most congested of the Wards, 203 persons living on each acre. It is nearly approached by Thornhill with 195, which in turn is followed by Barnsbury with 164. The densities of the remaining wards range from 127 persons to an acre in Upper Holloway, to 78 in Tufnell. A study of Tables V. and VI. on pages 11 and 12 shows that the densities of none of the large towns, and no great number of the Metropolitan Sanitary Districts, approaches those of the more thickly populated Wards of Islington. Population.—The estimated population of Islington at the middle of 1897 was 341,319 persons, which is an increase of only 1.1 per cent. on that of the preceding year. This is very different to the rate of increase which prevailed in past years, when it was no unusual circumstance for it to be as much as 3, 4, 5 and even 6 per cent. per annum. Islington is now pretty full, and, as shown in previous reports, is nearly covered with houses, so that any future increase of the population can only be attained by a greater aggregation of the people in the houses already built, and to a small extent by the occupation of houses yet to be erected. Ages of the Population.—In every one thousand of the population 118 are under 5 years old. 206 „ between 5 „ and 15 years. 200 „ „ 15 „ „ 25 „ 172 „ „ 25 „ „ 35 „ 124 ,, „ 35 „ ,, 45 ,, 8 ,, ,, 45 ,, ,, 55 ,, 54 „ ,, 55 „ „ 65 „ 28 ,, ,, 65 „ ,, 15 „ 11 „ „ 75 „ „ upwards. The age distribution of Islington is almost identical with that of London, so that in comparing their mortality returns very little correction would have to be made. It is not similarly distributed in other places as the following table shows. 1897] 10 Table III.

There were 6,000 persons married during the year, representing a marriage rate of 17.58 per 1,000 inhabitants. The marriages registered in each quarter were as follows:— No. Persons married.

BIRTHS. There were 9,842 births registered during the year as against 9,921 in the preceding year, which, it must be recollected, consisted of 53 weeks. The birth-rates are, however, almost identical, that for 1896 being 28.82 compared with 28.83 in 1897. Of the births 5,045 were those of males and 4,797 of females. The proportion of females born to every 100 males was 95.1. In Table VIII. it will be noticed that for some six years past the birth-rate has been gradually declining, but curiously enough being about equal to that which obtained in the first decade of systematic registration, when it was 28.65 per 1,000 inhabitants (Table IX.). In column 5 of this Table the births have been calculated on the supposition that the inhabitants in the parish at each period were equal to the number living in 1897. There it is seen that the births per annum in the decade 1841-50 were on the average 101 less than those of 1897, but in 1851-60 they averaged 1,950 more; in 1861-70 2,855, in 1871-80 2,650, in 1881-90 1,272, and in the six years 1891-96 263 more than in the year just closed. This is certainly not a matter for congratulation for in communities which are full of energy and work the birth-rate is generally high, whereas in communities and nations where these qualities are lacking it usually declines. Islington, however, is not as yet "to hastening ills a prey," for never in its history was it so full of business life, nor did its streets so resound with traffic. 15 [1897 Table VIII.

There were 5,395 deaths registered in London of persons belonging to the Parish of St. Mary, Islington. Of these deaths 2,707 were males and 2,688 females. The death-rate was 15.80 per 1,000 of the population, and it is the lowest since registration was introduced in 1837. The deaths were 754 below the mean number annually registered during the 12 years 1885-96, while the death-rate is 2.21 per 1,000 below the average death-rate of those years. This means that 754 persons are now alive, who, if the rate which obtained during the 12 years had been experienced in 1897, would otherwise have died. This is a large saving of human life, for which, from whatever cause or causes arising, Islingtonians have very great reason to be thankful. The nearest approach to the present death-rate was that of 1894, when it was 15.92 per 1,000. It is advisedly stated that the death-rate for 1897 was the lowest since registration was introduced in 1837. The writer is aware that on several occasions former Medical Officers of Health recorded marvellously . low figures, as for instance in 1886, when the death-rate was reported as being 15.7, in 1887 as 16.0, in 1888 as 14.0, in 1889 as 13.3, and in 1890 as 15.6. Now all these death-rates were absolutely incorrect, in the first place, because the deaths of Islingtonians in the Metropolitan Hospitals were not included, and in the second place, because there were errors in the estimated population, ranging from over 20,000 in 1885 to nearly 50,000 in 1890. Down to 1885 it was very difficult to correctly gauge the number of deaths of parishioners in Hospitals without the Parish, and, indeed, each of my predecessors commented on the difficulty in their Annual 1897] 22 Reports. Thus in 1864, Dr. Ballard after having calculated that to the deaths registered in the Parish minus the deaths of non-parishioners, there should be added 234 as "being the share of deaths in various Metropolitan Institutions which would fall to us, were those deaths apportioned out to the metropolitan districts in the proportion of their numerical strength." Then he goes on to add, "I am bound to say that although I take credit for so large a number, and have annually done so in accordance with this rule of apportionment, there is reason to believe that I am treating our Parish unjustly. From a return made last year to the House of Commons, it would appear that during the 10 years 1851-60, the annual correction necessary on this account was only an addition of 20 for about each 2,000 deaths. The true corrections I presume, would be about the same now."٭ In 1871, Dr. Corfield, who was then Medical Officer of Health, wrote, "we must, however, add a certain number as our share of the deaths taking place in Public Institutions in London, other than those included in our mortality tables; if we calculate this upon the population, a method which is perhaps as unfavourable a one as could be taken, we find it to be 297, a higher number than usual." In his report for 1874, my predecessor, Dr. Tidy, said, in speaking of the 4,680 deaths registered in the Parish, "these are exclusive of those of non-residents in the various Hospitals, which I have not considered it needful to take into calculation, our data for their estimation being so imperfect that any attempt to do so is very little better than a guess."† Nevertheless, it is most difficult to understand why, from 1885 downwards, he continued to omit the correction, although the materials for it had been supplied weekly by the RegistrarGreneral, who continues to supply them to the present time. ٭ At this time, however, he was overstating the population by over 4,000 in 1862 to 15,000 in 1868. † In this decade the population was overstated by 2,000 in 1874, increasing to nearly 10,000 in 1880. 23 [1897 A curious fact is, that previous Medical Officers of Health have assumed that the deaths registered by the Parish Registrars were in excess of the real number of deaths which should be credited to the district. And apparently they had reasonable grounds for doing so. It is very uncertain that they were correct, because since the Registrar General began to distribute the deaths it has become evident that those registered by the Parish Registrars are not always in excess of the distributed deaths, and sometimes the reverse is the case. As a proof of this, take the figures siuce 1885 to 1896 (inclusive.) In the six years 1885-90, it is found that on two occasions, namely, in 1885 and 1890, the distributed deaths exceeded those registered in the Parish, and that in these six years the total deaths actually exceeded the latter by 47. Deaths registered in the Parish Register, 1885-90 33,256 Deaths distributed by Registrar General, 1885-90 33,303 Excess of distributed deaths 47 On examining the next six years the distributed deaths are in each of five years seen to exceed the deaths entered in the Parish Registers, while in one year only are they less. The figures are:— Years. Entered in the Parish Registers. After distribution of London deaths by Registrar General. 1891 6,326 6,326 1892 5,983 6,075 1893 6,317 6,405 1894 5,103 5,266 1895 5,779 5,753 1896 5,747 5,871 1891-6 35,255 35,696 1897] 24 Deaths registered in the Parish Register, 1891-6 = 35,255 Deaths after distribution of the London deaths by Registrar General, 1891-6 = 35,696 Excess of distributed deaths = 441 Thus in the six years 1891-6, after the deaths of persons who died in London Public Institutions had been distributed to their residential districts, the deaths as recorded in the Islington parish registers were inoreased by 441. Under these circumstances it is not unreasonable to look on the death-rates, as given in the Medical Officers' Reports from 1855 to 1892 inclusive, as inaccurate, and to conclude that the death-rates calculated on the deaths registered by the District Registrars give a truer idea of the mortality. Further, it should be stated, that the invariable over. estimation of the populations renders any comparison between the death-rates given by the Medical Officers of Health and those of to-day out of the question. In the succeeding table is shown the population for each year (actual and as estimated by the Medical Officer of Health) and also the deaths together with those registered by the Parish Registrars, given in their reports by the Medical Officers, and as distributed by the Registrar General. There, also, are exhibited the death-rates as calculated on the actual population, as well as those given by the Medical Officers, together with the death-rates calculated on the distributed death returns of the Registrar General. By the term "actual," which is used in column 1 in reference to the population, is meant the populations as calculated by modern scientific methods on the bases of the enumerations of the people which were made at the beginning and end of each decade. The figures, therefore, show the populations as nearly correct as human beings can devise. 25 [1897 Table XV. Years. Populations. Deaths. Death-Rates. Actual.

In the face of the facts just mentioned it will not be possible to quote the rates in column 7 as exact unless there be a deliberate intention to deceive. The death-rate (15.8) of the Parish was nearly 2 per 1,000 less than that of the Metropolis as a whole. Out of the 43 London sanitary areas only 8 showed a lower crude death-rate, and only 7 a lower corrected death-rate, than Islington, while the population of none of these came within 150,000 of that of the Parish. These districts were— Population. Crude Death-rates. Corrected Death-rates. Paddington 126,161 14.4 15.56 Kensington 171,427 15.7 17.30 St. George's, Hanover Square 80,330 13.2 14.57 Hampstead 77,275 11.8 13.58 Stoke Newington 34,136 14.3 15.34 Wandsworth 195,612 13.4 14.31 Lee 39,215 13.2 14.30 Lewisham 86,152 12.8 13.68 Islington 341,319 15.8 16.90 Such a record is highly satisfactory. Islington is surrounded by seven populous districts, and a comparison of their death-rates with ours is always instructive. With the exception of Stoke Newington and Hornsey none showed nearly so low returns as those of Islington. The several death-rates were as follows:— Population. Crude Death-rates. Corrected Death-rates. St. Pancras 242,255 18.65 20.01 Hackney 216,698 16.48 17.26 Stoke Newington 34,136 14.30 15.34 Hornsey 65,282 8.98 — Clerkenwell 66,162 22.05 24.49 St. Luke 41,279 25.60 27.77 Shoreditch 121,883 21.56 22.42 The above Districts 787,695 18.16 — Islington 341,319 15.80 16.90 1897] 28 Satisfactory though these comparisons are, yet those made with the mortality of the Great Towns are even better, for out of 32 populous places only West Ham, Croydon, Brighton and Cardiff had so light a death-rate as that of Islington, while the rate for the 32 towns collectively was 3.9 per 1,000 higher. The following are the particulars:— Population. Crude Death-rates. Corrected Death-rates. West Ham 273,682 15.7 16.89 Croydon 121,171 13.1 13.62 Brighton 121,401 15.1 15.23 Cardiff 170,063 14.9 16.67 Islington 341,319 15.8 16.90 Finally, it is to be pointed out that the death-rate was below that of the country generally, as well as of England and Wales, less the 100 Chief Towns, that is to say, Rural England. England and Wales 17.4 per 1,000. Ditto less the 100 Chief Towns 16.4 „ Islington 15.8 „ MORTALITY IN THE SUB-REGISTRATION DISTRICTS. Upper Holloway. Only 1,481 deaths were registered in this district, a number which is 282 below the mean of the preceding five years. The death-rate was 14.75, or 3.71 per 1,000 below that registered in the years 1892-6. Now Upper Holloway contains a population of over 100,000 persons and would, therefore, be entitled if a provincial town to be reckoned as one of the 33 Great Urban Districts of England. An examination of the returns for these towns reveals the fact that only one of them, namely Croydon, had so low a death-rate, the next in order being Cardiff. Croydon 13.1 per 1,000 Cardiff 14.9 „ Upper Holloway 14.7 ,, 29 [1897 The great towns of Swansea. Derby, Burnley, Huddersfield, Halifax, and Gateshead contain populations which, numerically, are as nearly as possible the same size as that of Upper Holloway. A comparison of their death-rates is therefore interesting. Towns. Persons to an acre. Death-rate. Plymouth 42.6 19.0 Swansea 19.7 15.8 Derby 29.9 16.0 Burnley 27.1 19.5 Huddersfield 8.6 16.4 Halifax 11.2 16.5 Gateshead 32.2 18.3 Upper Holloway 97.6 14.7 Here it is seen that although Upper Holloway is more than twice as densely populated as the densest of these towns, yet its death-rate is more than one per thousand less than their lowest rate. South-West Islington. Here 1,855 deaths, equal to a death-rate of 17.20 per 1,000, were registered. The former are 156 below the average number registered during the five years 1892-6, and the latter 1.64 per 1,000 below the mean death-rate for the same years. The district is also eligible to rank as a Great Town, its population being estimated at 107,832 persons. In this respect the following urban districts are comparable with it:— Towns. Persons to an acre. Death-rates. Norwich 14.6 18.8 Birkenhead 31.9 18.3 Burnley 27.1 19.5 Preston 28.1 24.4 South-West Islington 132.6 17.2 When one looks at the great density of the district, as compared with the other places mentioned, the death-rate must be considered to be very satisfactory. 1897] 30 South-East Islington. There were 1,173 deaths registered as against an average 1,212 in the preceding five years. The death-rate was equal to 17.46 per 1,000 inhabitants, and compares favourably with the quinquennial mean-rate of 18.44. As regards population this district can be compared with the following lesser towns:— Towns. Persons to an acre. Death-rates. Reading 11.6 14.1 Northampton 51.5 16.4 Ipswich 7.7 16.9 West Bromwich 10.5 20.6 Grimsby 21.6 17.0 Warrington 20.2 19.4 Newport 15.3 15.9 Merthyr Tydfil 3.7 24.5 South-East Islington 145.0 17.5 Considering the enormous difference of the density of the populations, it must be admitted that the death-rate of the district is not excessive. Highbury. The mortality and the death-rate of this district were extremely low, the deaths numbering 886, as against an average of 994 in the preceding five years, and the rate being 13.43 as against 15.86. Highbury may also be compared as regards population with the eight provincial towns mentioned above. Of these Reading with its deathrate of 14.1 is the only one that approaches it in health, but whereas the density of the former is only 11.6 persons per acre, that of the latter is 81.9, or sevenfold more. 31 [1897 Table XVI.

Per 1,000 inhabitants. 1st Quarter 1,421 deaths = 16.65 2nd „ 1,081 „ = 12.67 3rd „ 1,335 „ = 15.64 4th „ 1,558 = 18.26 First Quarter.— The 1,421 deaths were the lowest returns since 1885, the year in which the Registrar-General first collected and distributed the deaths of persons dying in public institutions without their several districts. The death-rate was 16.65 per 1,000. In this period, also, 122 persons died from the Zymotic Diseases, which was the most favourable return for this period of the year with one exception (1895) since 1885. Second Quarter.—The returns for this quarter were extraordinarily good, being not only a record for Islington for any period of three months, but probably for any community of a similar size. The deaths numbered 1,081, and the death-rate was only 12.67 per 1,000. There had been no approach to this return in any quarter since 1885 (which, as already shown, is the first year for which absolutely reliable data are available, with the exception of the third quarter of 1888) when the deaths numbered 1,072, and the death-rate was 13.88. If the population of that year had been as large as it was last year the deaths would have numbered 1,184, or 103 more than the return under discussion. 1888—3rd quarter, corrected deaths 1,184 = 13.88 per 1,000 1897—2nd „ „ „ 1,081 = 12.67 „ Difference 103 = 1.22 „ c 1897] 34 When the quarter's return was compared with the mean number of deaths, after correction for increase of population, which obtained during the second quarters of the twelve years 1885-96, it was found to be 347 less. 1885-96—2nd quarter 1,428 deaths = 16.73 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1897 „ „ 1,081 „ = 12.67 „ „ 347 „ = 4.06 „ „ Only 62 deaths were registered from the zymotic diseases, resulting in the marvellously low death-rate of 0.72 per 1,000. This result was due to a diminished mortality from each of the principal infectious diseases. The decrease compared with the corrected average number of deaths for twelve years was 167. One can hardly hope that such a record as this will soon recur. Third Quarter.—The mortality was very satisfactory despite the fact that the season was very favourable for diarrhœa. The registered deaths numbered 1,335, which were equal to a death-rate of 15.64. The former were 49 below the corrected average of the twelve years 1885-96, and the latter 0.56 below the mean rate for the same period. Notwithstanding the fact that the season was favourable for diarrhoea there was a decrease of 45 deaths from the zymotic diseases upon the corrected average of the preceding twelve third quarters, and a decrease of 0.77 per 1,000 in the zymotic death-rate. The number of deaths was 252, and the rate 2.95. The following table gives the deaths and death-rates from Diarrhœa in each of the districts, as well as the chief meteorological conditions which prevailed during the period:— 35 [1897 Table XX.

This increase in the rate was a disappointment for the earlier returns gave promise of a much lower mortality. Indeed, the first seven weeks of the quarter seemed to point to an unusually favourable record, but the advent of fogs in November, which continued without interruption to the end of the year, together with the outbreak of Measles and Whooping Cough, destroyed the anticipation. Notwithstanding these circumstances the deaths were only 27 above the corrected average for twelve years, and were equal to an increase in the death-rate of 0.32 per 1,000. Table XXI.

There were 622 deaths, equal to a death-rate of 1.82 per 1,000, which is the lowest rate known in the district for many years, or, at least, of which there exists any reliable record. After making allowance for the great increase of the population these deaths are 170 below the average of the twelve years 1885—96. This is particularly gratifying, as it shows that the labour of the Vestry in its crusade against the Zymotic Diseases has not been in vain. Table XXV. Showing the Deaths from the principal Zymotic Diseases for the Twelve years 1885-96 and in 1897. Years. Deaths. Deathrates. Years. Deaths.

The figures speak for themselves, and, therefore, require no commentary. When the comparison is made with the largest towns of the country, that is to say, with those whose populations exceed 200,000 inhabitants, the result is also very favourable to this locality.

To this disease were ascribed 97 deaths, of which 72 occurred in the fourth quarter. The Measles death-rate was equal to 0.28 per 1,000 inhabitants. These deaths were 114 below the corrected average for the twelve years 1885-96, and were less than those registered in any one of these years with the exception of 1886. Indeed, were it not for events that occurred subsequent to the close of the third quarter of the year it would have been unnecessary to have commented on the returns of the year, which, taken as a whole, were entirely satisfactory. But this matter will be referred to later on. Table XXXIV. Showing the deaths from Measles in the several quarters, 1885-96. Years. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter.

It was also lower than that of England and Wales (0.40), of the 33 Great Towns (0.55), of the 67 Other Large Towns (0.43), or of the Rural Districts (0.29). Consequently it must be considered good, even when contrasted with the behaviour of the disease during the past twelve years in Islington itself, the mortality for which period was at the rate of 0.56 per 1,000 of its inhabitants. Indeed, it was no less than 50 per cent. below the average rate of those years, and would have been very much less were it not for the sudden outbreak in the fourth quarter. D 2 52 1897 We see in Table XXXV. that with the exception of a slight excess of deaths in the first quarter in South-east Islington, there was no reason to complain of the returns for the first three quarters. All the rates were abnormally low, and nothing locally indicated that there would be so sharp an outbreak in the fourth quarter. And yet Upper Holloway, which had only one death in the first quarter, and none in either the second or third quarters, was afflicted with as many as 37 in the fourth, which were equal to the high death rate of l.47 per 1,000. Almost identical remarks might be made with respect to South-west Islington, which was also severely dealt with in the fourth quarter, the death-rate being 0.78. South-east Islington was the only district that escaped lightly at this period, for its death-rate was only 0.23 per 1,000. When, however, one looks to the behaviour of the disease in the Encircling Districts in the second and third quarters of the year, it can no longer be a matter of surprise that so many as 72 deaths occurred in Islington in the fourth quarter. Itisseenin the following table (XXXVII.) that Measles was more or less prevalent in all of them in the second and third quarters. This was especially so in Clerkenwell, St. Luke and Shoreditch in the second quarter, and in Hackney, Clerkenwell, St. Luke and Shoreditch in the third quarter, at which periods the Measles-death rate in Islington was abnormally low.

The deaths, which were 61 in number, were 1 above the corrected average of the preceding twelve years. They were equal to a death-rate of 0.18 per 1,000 inhabitants, which was slightly above that which obtained in the Encircling Districts, viz., 0.17. It is the same as the death-rate of the 33 Great Towns, and slightly above that (0.15) of the 67 Other Large Towns. In the preceding twelve years the returns have been as follows:— 1885 36 deaths. 1892 53 deaths. 1886 26 „ 1893 94 „ 1887 55 „ 1894 69 1888 64 „ 1895 66 „ 1889 40 „ 1896 57 „ 1890 65 „ Corrected Mean 60 „ 1891 50 „ 1897 61 „ The most fatal incidence of the disease was in Islington South-east, where 17 deaths caused a death-rate of 0.25 per 1,000, but it was also slightly excessive in Islington South-west, where with 22 deaths the rate was 0.20. The particulars for the sub-districts for each quarter and for the year are given in the two succeeding tables. Table XLI. Showing the Deaths from Scarlet Fever in the Sub-Districts for each Quarter.

Diphtheria was credited with 115 deaths, which represent a death-rate of 0.33 per 1,000 inhabitants per annum. The deaths were 26 below the corrected average for twelve years. They were also 132 below the number registered in the preceding year as well as 35 below the lowest return of the preceding six years. This is a matter for considerable congratulation as this disease is one of the most fatal which attacks juvenile life. The returns for the twelve years 1885.96 are as follows:— 1885 167 deaths. 1892 150 deaths. 1886 72 „ 1893 180 „ 1887 46 „ 1894 208 „ 1888 50 „ 1895 137 „ 1889 62 „ 1896 247 „ 1890 81 „ Corrected Mean 141 „ 1891 158 „ 1897 116 „ It is satisfactory to note that the death-rate (0.33) was considerably below that of the Encircling Districts (0.55), and was indeed below each 57 1897 taken separately with the exception of Hornsey's, which was 0.26 per 1,000. It nearly approached that of the 33 Great Towns (0.31), a position which it has not attained for many years. This return includes that of London (0.51), which, if excluded, would leave the rate of the 32 Great Towns at 0.18 per 1,000, a rate which seems almost beyond hoping for here. The Islington death-rate was only exceeded in the Great Towns by Cardiff (0.53), Wolverhampton (0.62), Leicester (0.36), Burnley (0.57), and yet looking on the disease as it has prevailed with us and in London in past years the death-rate far the year must be considered satisfactory. The return for the preceding twelve years given above shows that since 1887 there has been a steady upward tendency in the mortality returns for which there seems only one way to account, namely the influence of schools. In a later part of this report this subject is discussed, and charts printed, which show fairly conclusively that these, if not the chief factor in its propagation, are at least a potent influence for evil. Of the London Districts only seven show a lower death-rate. These are Hammersmith (0.28), St. George's, Hanover Square (0.21), St. James, Westminster (0.13), Hampstead (0.22), St. Giles (0.19), St. Martin'sin-the-Fields (0.24), Strand (0.21). Table XLIII.

Whooping Cough was the certified cause of 130 deaths, as against a corrected average in the preceding twelve years of 206, or a decrease of 76. It is the lowest return, with two exceptions, in twelve years. The death-rate was equal to 0.38 per 1,000, and compares very favourably with that of other places. Thus the death-rate of the 33 Great Towns was 0.41 per 1,000, of the 67 Other Large Towns 0.38, of the Rural Districts 0.31, and of the Encircling Districts 0.49 per 1,000. The preceding records of the disease were :— 1885 210 deaths 1893 181 deaths 1886 214 „ 1894 188 „ 1887 240 „ 1895 81 „ 1888 231 „ 1896 234 „ 1889 86 „ 1890 204 „ Corrected mean 206 „ 1891 255 „ 1892 161 „ 1897 130 „ 59 1897 Table XLV.

Enteric Fever gave rise to 44 deaths, or 2 less than the corrected average number during the years 1885-96. It was also 2 below the return of 1896. The death-rate was 0.12 per 1,000 of the population. This rate was less than that experienced in the Encircling Districts, where it was 0.15, but was exactly equal to that of London. It was 0.06 below the rate of the 33 Great Towns, and 0.04 below that which obtained in the 67 Other Large Towns. Locally the mortality was least in Highbury, where the death-rate was only 0.07 per 1,000, and higher in Upper Holloway and South-east Islington, in each of which it was 0.16. In the past twelve years it caused the following deaths :— 1885 63 deaths. 1893 48 deaths. 1886 60 „ 1894 36 „ 1887 45 „ 1895 30 „ 1888 59 „ 1896 46 „ 1889 61 „ Corrected mean 46 „ 1890 39 „ 1891 32 „ 1897 44 „ 1892 41 „ Table XLVII.

The record from this disease was also very good, the 174 deaths ascribed to it having been 37 below the corrected average of 211 of the preceding twelve years. The death-rate was 0.51 per 1,000 inhabitants. This rate contrasted most favourably with the mortality of the Encircling Districts (0.97), of which Hornsey alone was less (0.49), and also with the rates which prevailed in the London Districts, of which only five exhibited so low a return proportionally to population. These were St. George's, Hanover Square (0.31), St. James, Westminster (0.40), Hampstead (0.36), St. Martin-in-the-Fields (0.16), and the City (0.17). When the comparison is made farther afield it is seen that only 3 of the Great Towns were proportionally so free from deaths from Diarrhœa, namely, Swansea (0.21), Huddersfield (0.35) and Halifax (0.32), and that only 8 of the 67 Other Large Towns showed a lower rate, and not one of these were much more than half the size of our smallest sub-registration district. 62 1897 The deaths recorded since 1885 were :— 1885 197 deaths. 1892 189 deaths. 1886 320 „ 1893 237 1887 309 „ 1894 93 „ 1888 162 „ 1895 188 „ 1889 178 „ 1896 153 1890 180 „ Corrected Mean 211 1891 159 „ 1897 174 „ Table XLIX.

The Infantile Mortality showed the gratifying decrease of deaths on the return of the preceding year. The children under twelve months old who died numbered 1,338 as against ?? in 1896. The Infantile Mortality rate was 136 per 1,000 births. The records for the preceding fourteen years were as follows:— Years. Deaths under 1 year. Deaths per 1,000 Births. Years. Deaths under 1 year. Deaths per 1,000 Births. 1883 1,312 132 1891 1,481 151 1884 1,506 150 1892 1,417 148 1885 1,387 144 1893 1,595 163 1886 1,512 154 1894 1,229 129 1887 1,557 160 1895 1,416 143 1888 1,271 133 1896 1,490 150 1889 1,261 132 Mean 1,423 146 1890 1,488 168 1897 1338 136 Here we see that the infantile deaths were 85 below the average (without correction for the largely increased number of children now living under twelve months) of the preceding fourteen years, and that the infantile mortality rate was less by 10 per 1,000 births.- How good this rate was may be readily seen by the succeeding statement in which it will be observed that not only was the rate of 136 per 1,000 births lower than that experienced in England and Wales, but even lower than the rate which prevailed in the Rural Districts (i.e, England and Wales less the 100 Towns). 1897 72 England and Wales 156 per 1,000 births.

The total cases of the notifiable diseases numbered 2,906, which is 566 less than the corrected average of the preceding six years, and as many as 976 below the number notified in 1896. The case-rate was 8.51 per 1,000 inhabitants, as against an average rate of 10.09 experienced in the years 1891-6, and 11.15 in the year immediately preceding. The returns for past years are as follows:— Cases. 1891 2,063 = 6.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1892 3,320 = 10.3 ,, ,, 1893 4,853 = 14.8 ,, ,, 1894 3,123 = 9.4 ,, ,, 1895 2,840 = 8.5 ,, ,, 1896 3,882 = 11.15 ,, ,, Corrected mean 3,472 = 10.09 ,, ,, 1897 2,806 = 8.51 ,, ,, In London the case-rate was 10.20, and in the Encircling Districts 10.4 per 1,000 of the population. The cases and case-rates referred to the several sub-registration districts were as follows :— Cases. Upper Holloway 983 = 9.8 per 1,000 inhabitants. South-west Islington 855 = 7.9 ,, ,, South-east „ 589 = 8.8 ,, ,, Highbury 479 = 7.3 ,, ,, Total 2,906 = 8.5 ,, ,, In each district the cases reported were less than in the preceding year. Thus they fell in Upper Holloway from 1,256 to 983; in South- 75 1897 west Islington from 1,140 to 855; in South-east Islington from 806 to 589; and in Highbury from 620 to 479. In Table LXXX. (column 15), it is seen that there was least sickness in proportion to population in West Highbury Ward, and most sickness in Tollington Ward; the case-rate of the former being only 638, and of the latter 12.45. In Tollington Ward the sickness was chiefly confined to its southern part, whose population is perhaps more careless than that of any other part of Islington about those essential matters which make for health. In the succeeding Tables full particulars are given of the localities in which the diseases occurred. SMALL POX. Only 3 cases were notified. These cases occurred at 74, Junction Road, 87, Balls Pond Road, and 27, Parolles Road.

To this disease were attributed 1,577 cases of illness, which were equal to a rate of 4.62 per 1,000 of the population. They were 454 77 1897 less than those notified in 1896, and also 246 less than the corrected mean of the years 1891-96. Only twice previously has the return been so good, namely, in the first year of notification, when 728 cases were reported, and in 1894 when 1,493 cases were declared. 1891 728 cases = 2.27 case-rate per 1,000 inhabitants. 1892 1,710 „ = 5.29 „ „ „ 1893 2,880 „ = 8.81 „ „ „ 1894 1.493 „ = 4.52 „ „ „ 1895 1,692 „ = 5.06 „ „ „ 1896 2,031 „ = 6.01 „ „ „ Corrected Mean 1,823 „ = 5.54 1897 1,577 „ =462 „ In proportion to its population Highbury was most free from the disease, the case-rate being as low as 3.98 ; and in this district also the fatality, i.e., the ratio of deaths to cases, was least, being only 26 per cent., whereas in South-east Islington it was as high as 4.8. The fatality for the parish was 3.9 as against 2.8 in 1896. It is noteworthy that although the cases of Scarlet Fever were unusually numerous in the preceding year, yet the fatality was low. Indeed, if we take the records of each quarter of that year and compare them with those of this year it is seen that in every instance the former are less than the latter. 1st Qtr. 2nd Qtr. 3rd Qtr. 4th Qtr.

There were 700 cases of sickness attributed to Diphtheria, representing a case-rate of 2.05 per 1,000 of the population. This return is very much less than that of the preceding year, when 1,067 cases were notified, so that there was a decrease of 367. It is also 119 less than the corrected mean number of cases known in the years 1891-96. The record of this disease since 1891 has been as follows:— Years. Cases. Case-rates. Deaths. Fatality (deaths per 100 cases). 1891 712 2.22 158 22.2 1892 695 2.15 150 21.6 1893 855 2.61 189 21.1 1894 843 2.55 208 24.7 1895 564 1.69 137 24.3 1896 1,067 3.16 247 23.1 Corrected Mean 819 2.49 182 23.0 1897 700 2.05 115 16.4 Diphtheria was distributed in the Parish unequally, the number of cases in proportion to population being as high as 2.65 per 1,000 in Upper Holloway, and as low as 1.56 in Highbury. The former district, as a rule, has always been the greatest sufferer, which is probably in part attributable to the heavy clay soil that is found there, and possibly to some extent to sewerage conditions. The latter circumstance is one that must be considered, for although it is strenuously denied by some authorities that bad drainage is a cause of this disease, it cannot be denied that such an evil undermines the constitution and leaves it more prone and susceptible to the diphtheritic contagium. Noxious smells and air mixed with sewer gases, even though the smell be not perceptible, have a very harmful effect on the throat, and consequently if persons in this weakened state, particularly children, come within the influence of the disease, they are almost certain to be attacked. That defective sewerage existed in Upper Holloway is only too true, for it is a well known fact 80 1897 that the County Council relief sewer which runs through the district has had a very serious deposit in it, and that many hundred tons of sewage hare been removed from it. Men had been engaged on its, shall we say repair?—for it has been denied that there is anything wrong with it—for nearly two years, and they were so engaged up to three months ago, and curiously enough as they proceeded with their work so this disease decreased in Upper Holloway, but more particularly in those streets which abut on Holloway Road, in which this sewer is laid. In Upper Holloway Ward only 77 cases were known, whereas in 1896 there were 177 notified. The number of cases known in the Wards for the several years between 1891 and the present time have been as shown in Table L in Appendix. The weekly returns from the disease were generally above the average of the preceding years in the first quarter, but in the second quarter an improvement took place, so that from that time to the end of the year notifications were as a rule below the weekly mean. Indeed, it was only on six occasions that they exceeded it. (Vide Chart p. 79.) An extraordinary circumstance about the Diphtheria cases notified was, that the fatality (16.1 per cent.) was lower than in any previous year, being 7.4 below the average of the preceding six years. Even if the deaths from Membranous Croup be taken into consideration, the proportion of fatal cases is only raised to 17.8 per cent. It kept very low during the second and third quarters, while during the first and fourth quarters it was considerably under the record of the corresponding quarters for six years. 1st Quarters. 2nd Quarters. 3rd Quarters. 4th Quarters, Years. 1897. 6 years. 1897. 6 years. 1897. 6 years 1897. 6 years. 1897. 6 years.

Thus in the first quarter's return there was a decrease of 7.6, in the second of 100, in the third of 5.2, and in the fourth of 5.6. On the year it was 7.6. The decrease in the fatality was not confined solely to patients treated in Public Institutions. Indeed it was even more noticeable among those patients treated at home, for while 17.7 per cent. of the former died, only 15.2 per cent. of the latter succumbed. Cases Nursed in Hospital. Quarter.

It will also be noticed that the proportion of deaths among the patients nursed at home was generally less than among those sent to hospital. This may be, and indeed is, explained by the fact that, whereas the less acute cases are kept at home, as a rule the more grave cases, e.g , those requiring tracheotomy, are sent to hospital, and therefore, the fact that the fatality among the hospital cases is greater than that f 82 1897 among the home cases, must not be taken as indicating that the treatment or nursing is better at home, for the reverse is the case, except of course in the homes of the wealthy where the best nursing skill is nearly always available. In consequence of the great reduction in the general fatality from the disease the question arises. What is the cause ? One would naturally be desirous to trace it to the new antitoxin treatment, if one could; but in the face of the fact that while this treatment is very general in hospitals, where without doubt it has had good results, yet it has not become so general among private practitioners as to account for the great decrease in the fatality among the home patients. One is, therefore, forced to the conclusion that the type of the disease was not so malignant as in the preceding six years; another explanation may be that parents are becoming more aware that it is very necessary, if life is to be saved, to have the cases treated at the very earliest moment, as there is possibly no disease where treatment in its earliest stages is so essential, especially if the antitoxin serum is to be prescribed.

The 256 cases, which were entered under this heading, were equal to a case-rate of 0.75 per 1,000. They were 28 above the corrected average of the preceding six years, the returns for which are as follows :— 1891 189 cases = 0.59 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1892 219 „ = 0.08 „ „ 1893 251 „ = 0.77 „ „ 1894 245 „ = 0.74 „ „ 1895 184 „ = 0.55 „ „ 1896 229 „ = 0.68 „ „ Corrected Mean 228 „ = 0.69 „ „ 1897 256 „ = 0.75 „ „ The present return is higher than that of any previous year. The increase seems to have been distributed over each quarter, for it is seen on the chart that on seven occasions in the first quarter, on five occasions in the second quarter, on six occasions in the third quarter, and on six occasions in the fourth quarter, the weekly returns exceeded the mean of the preceding years. It is noticeable when the mean number for the week was more than the notifications that it was generally very small, whereas when the latter exceeded the former the increase was more or less substantial. (Vide Chart). The Islington Workhouse Schools were responsible for nine cases, the source of which was the use by the boys as a urinal of a water-safe tray placed under a water tap. Now this tray had been connected to the drain by means of a 4 inch pipe, which for some reason had been disconnected from the drain and sealed off at its junction. It was not, however, disconnected from the tray, and consequently when the latter was used as described, the pipe some 25 feet long became charged with urine, so that in time gases were given off from the decomposing urine, and as this took place on the staircase near the dormitories it can be understood that the boys were most favourably placed for attack. Under 86 1897 the circumstances it is surprising that even more have not been stricken. It is supposed that a boy who was suffering from Enteric Fever used this water-safe tray, and so infected the urine in the pipe. A very interesting fact about these cases is that they illustrate the possibility of urine being a means of propagating Enteric Fever, a circumstance which was once denied, but which in the light of recent investigations must now be admitted. With the exception of these cases and of 6 in Campbell Road, the disease may be said to have been of a purely sporadic character. There was, however, a group of 3 cases in one house in Dunford Road, of 3 in Regina Road, of 3 in Milton Place off Eden Grove, and of 3 in Gloucester Road.

Careful inquiries into every case of infectious disease, notified under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, disclosed the fact that 1,070 were in attendance at the elementary public schools. Of these patients 753 suffered from Scarlet Fever, 267 from Diphtheria, 38 from Enteric Fever, and 12 from other ailments. The accompanying table gives the particulars for each school. The returns do not show that any disease was particularly prevalent in any particular school, if an exception be made of Pooles Park Board School, where no less than 31 scholars were attacked with Diphtheria which disease also seized on 17 children who lived in houses from which scholars attended the school. These cases did not, however, break out simultaneously but were distributed over the year. 1st Quarter 4 Scholars 5 Non-Scholars. 2nd „ 6 ,, 5 „ 3rd „ 10 „ 4 „ 4th „ 11 „ 3 „ So far as the notifiable diseases were concerned, no circumstance arose which called for interference with the schools, but with regard to Measles, which is not a notifiable disease, the Public Health Committee acting as the Sanitary Authority called on the Managers to close the Infants' Departments of Trinity Street, Pooles Park and Upper Hornsey Road Board Schools, and of St. Anne's Church School. It will be recollected that in the Annual Report for 1896 particular attention was drawn to the conduct of the School Board for London with respect to this disease. After the correspondence that then occurred between the Local Government Board, the Education Department, the School Board, and the Vestry one could scarcely be prepared after so short a period for another failure of the School Board Officials to carry out the instructions of their code. And yet this is exactly what happened! With the addition that when the names and addresses of the Scholars in attendance at the Infant Department of Trinity School were required for the purpose of visiting their homes, to ascertain how far Measles still existed in them, the information was refused; and Table LXXXII.

But curiously enough the very next day the information refused by him it was granted by the Vice-Chairman of the School Management Committee, who undertook the responsibility of giving it. And it may be now stated that it has been granted ever since, and that it has proved of the greatest value in enabling the Vestry's Medical Officer of Health to come to a determination as to whether he should advise that a school should be re-opened at the end of three weeks or be kept closed for a further short period. Generally the routine practice which prevails throughout the country with respect to Measles is to close schools for a period of six weeks. This means a serious educational loss, and, therefore, to be avoided if possible. In Islington the practice recommended by the Medical Offier of Health was to close the affected Department of the School for three weeks, and towards the close of the last week to cause an inquiry to be made at each house as to the presence or absence of the disease. A list of the houses still remaining infected was then made out and forwarded to the Head Teacher of the School with a request that no scholars from them be admitted until further information had been received from the Vestry. This practice has worked remarkably well, and has been the means of enabling the schools to be re-opened at a much earlier date than they otherwise would have been. Under these circumstances, it was a most extraordinary as well as a most short-sighted policy for the School Board and its Officials to place difficulties in the way of the Vestry and its Medical Officer of Health, who were anxious to facilitate the work of education in Islington to the utmost extent. The late Rev. Hugh Rose, M.A., Vicar of Clerkenwell, who was a member of the School Board at the time, took a great interest in this matter, and to him, in a great degree, is due the more conciliatory policy at present pursued. During this period two reports were presented by the Medical Officer of Health, and as they are important documents they are now reprinted, with the omission of the names and addresses of the Scholars G 2 100 1897] These reports were as follows :— To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Sir, Madam and Gentlemen, OUTBREAK OF MEASLES IN THE INFANTS' DEPARTMENT OF THE RICHARD STREET BOARD SCHOOL. I regret to have to report that a serious outbreak of Measles has taken place in the Infant Class of the Richard Street Board School, so that up to Friday, the 22nd instant, no less than 99 children have been excluded from attendance because of the presence of this disease in their homes, or because they themselves had been attacked with it. The discovery of the outbreak was quite accidental. It happened in this way : It was my duty on Friday last to visit a child (living in Trinity Street) who was reported to have been allowed to play in the streets while in a state of desquamation after Scarlet Fever. Mr. Saunders, the Superintendent of Visitors of the School Board, Finsbury District, and also a member of the Public Health Committee of this Vestry, had previously written to me as to the disinfection of the house in which she lived. As it was situated immediately opposite his office in Trinity Street, I called on him, to save the trouble of writing, to give him the information he had sought. In course of conversation he casually remarked on the large number of cases of Measles in Richard Street Infant School close at hand. Having expressed my surprise that no one had informed me of it, I at once visited the School and had an interview with the Head Teacher of the Infant School, who very courteously promised to supply me, and did subsequently supply me, with a full list of the children who had been excluded through Measles up to and including that date (22nd instant). Next morning (Saturday) I sent the following telegram to the Medical Officer of the School Board;— "Medical Officer, "School Board, "I advise immediate closing of Richard Street Infant School in which there "is an outbreak of Measles. Ninety-nine children at present excluded from the " School. "HARRIS, "Medical Officer, "Islington. I also addressed the following letter to the Rev. J. H. Rose,* Chairman of Managers of the School:— * I have since discovered that this gentleman has retired from the position, but he forwarded the letter to the present Chairman of Managers. 101 [1897 "Vestry Hall, Upper Street, N. 23rd October, 1897. "Dear Sir, "I beg to inform you of a serious outbreak of Measles in the Infants "Department of the Richard Street Board School, and I have to adviso that this "portion of the School be immediately closed. "I have already wired to this effect to the Medical Officer of the School "Board for London. I am, "Yours faithfully, "(Signed) A. E. HARRIS. "Medical Officer of Health. "Rev. J. H. Rosb, "Chairman of Managers of the "Richard Street Board Schools." 1 have given the question of the closing of the Infant School my most careful consideration, and I am, thereforn, now prepared to advise that you call on the Managers of the Richard Street Board Schools, under the provisions of Article 88 of the Code of Regulations for Day Schools, 1897, to close the Infants' Department for a period of three weeks, dating from the 23rd instant. In fixing this period I am to an extent guided by Article 148 (v) of the " Code of Regulations and Instructions," &c., of the School Board for London, which says that— "Children suffering from Mumps or Measles must be excluded for a month." It seems to me, however, if, shortly before the end of the three weeks, every house in which the childrer attending the Infant School live were visited, that I would then bo in a position to advise as to the possibility of re-opening the School at the end of the shorter period. In order, however, to be able to do this it will be necessary for the School Board to furnish me with a complete list of the names and addresses of the infant scholars. I am confident that this information will be gladly afforded, as it is entirely in the interest of the School that the visits should be made. If, on inquiry, it is found that the cases of Measles are few in number, it will be possible to re-open the School, but if it should be discovered that the disease is still prevalent, then, of course, it would be necessary to keep it closed for a longer period. It is not for me to apportion blame to any person serving another Board, but I am certain that you will agree with me that there has been very great remissness on the part of the School Authorities in not sending information to me, as Medical Officer of Health, of all cases of Measles as they occurred. In the "Code of Regulations and Instructions for the Guidance of Managers Correspondents and Teachers," it is laid down in Regulation 148 (ii.) that— "Any child showing symptoms of an infectious disease, or any child coming "from a house where an infectious disease exists, must be sent home at once, and "the Superintendent of Visitors must be immediately informed of the case, in 102 1897] "order that inquiries may at once be made with a view to proper steps being "taken to prevent the children living in the same house or tenement from attend"ing School." "The Medical Officer of Health for the District must also at the same time "be informed of the child's exclusion, and furnished with the name and address "of the child, and the reason for its exclusion on a form with which the teachers "will be supplied by the Head Office." Last year you will recollect that the School Board and its officials not only did not assist this Vestry in its efforts to limit the spread of an epidemic of Measles, but went out of their way to retard them. I sincerely trust that a similar policy will not be followed now. On paper the School Board's Regulations for checking the spread of infectious diseases are most admirable, but their execution is a lamentable failure, for either knowingly, or through ignorance of their duties, the teachers habitually neglect to obey several of them, and particularly that one (148, 2) as to forwarding information of a child's exclusion from a school to the Medical Officer of Health. I am inclined to the belief from inquiries I have recently made that the teachers have acted through ignorance. If this be so then it seems to me that tho blame for failuro to notify must rest on the officer whose duty it is to see that the School Board's own regulations with respect to infectious diseases are duly obeyed, that is if there be such an officer. Possibly if the School Board were written to they might direct their Medical Officer's attention to the matter, if it should fall within the scope of his duties, when I have no doubt a much needed reformation would be effected; one, too, which might be the means of obviating the closure of schools against an alleged prevalence of Measles in a district in which the Medical Officer of Health has not received any definite information of the extent of the disease in his district, for he would then obtain early information, probably beforo a death was registered, which at present is almost the first notice he receives, that the disease had appeared therein. Up to now the Sanitary Authorities have done everything for the Board Schools, and it is, therefore, not too much to ask that the School Board should in turn assist in preventing the spread of that disease from which the mortality amongst children is greater than tho mortality from all tho notifiable diseases put together. Since the above portion of this report was written I have received the following telegram, dated October 25th, 6.20 p.m., from Professor Smith, tho Medical Officer of the School Board:— "Dr. Harris, "Vestry Offices, "Upper Street, Islington. "Having received dotailed report from Head Mistress, I have advised "immediate closure of the Infant School, Richard Street, which will take "effect at once. "SMITH." 103 [1897 I have also to inform the Committee that I have just received a report from Messrs. West and Jordan, Sanitary Inspectors, that out of the 99 children excluded 57 live in Islington, and of these 35, or 61 per cent, are ill. The remaining 22 live in the neighbouring parish of Clerkenwell. I am, your obedient Servant, ALFRED E. HARRIS, Vestry Hall, Islington, Medical Officer of Health. 25 th October, 1897. This report was followed on the 8th November by the following report:— To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Sir Madam and Gentlemen, MEASLES. At Richard Street Board School. In my previous roport you will recollect that I mentioned that I was confident that the School Board for London would supply me with a list of the scholars attending the Infant Classes. On the 26th October I made an application to the Medical Officer of the Board in the following terms: "Let me say that I have boon requested to make every effort before that time (i.e., the date of the re-opening of the School) to ascertain accurately the number of scholars who have been attacked, or who are living in houses in which sickness exists." "In order to facilitate this inquiry, I shall feel obliged if you will forward me a list containing the names of all scholars attending the Infant School." On the 2nd November I received a letter, not from Professor Smith (who acknowledged its receipt through his clerk) with whom I had communicated in deference to the wish expressed in the letter of the Local Government Board, of the 25th March, 1896, but from the Clerk to the Board, in which he said, "I have further to inform you that the Committee (i.e., the School Management Committee) regret that they are unable to accede to your request for a list of the names and addresses of the children attending the Infant School This was so extraordinary and inexplicable a refusal that on the same date I addressed the following letter to the Clerk to the Board:— Vestry Hall, Upper Street, N., 2nd November, 1897. Bear Sir, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, and in reply I havo to express my surprise that your Board has refused to grant the Vestry a list of the names and addresses of tho scholars attending the infant school, Richard Street. This request has been made entirely in tho interest of the school, so that it might not be kept closcd a day longer than was absolutely necessary, and, on the other hand, that tho health and lives of the children might not be jeopardised by a too early return to school. 104 1897] If the Vestry were given this information it would bo possible to arrive at an accurate knowledge of the amount of disease, if any, remaining in the homes of scholars. My Public Health Committee intended that prior to the re-opening of the School the Vestry's Inspectors and myself should personally visit the homes of the children, and there obtain informatien as to the presence or absence of disease in each family. The Vestry would then be in a position to advise the School Board as to the re-opening of the School. Without it the Vestry will be compelled to arrive at a decision based on the return of deaths from Measles, which might easily be misleading, either through exaggerating or minimising the number of existing cases. If the information, which is so earnestly desired, is to bo of any use it should be sent to the Vestry at once, so that I may be in a position to report to the Public Health Committee on Monday evening next. An early reply will, therefore greatly oblige, Yours faithfully, (Signed) A. E. HARRIS, J. H. Croad, Esq. Medical Officer of Health. To this letter I received the following reply, dated 6th November, 1897, from the Clerk:— In reply to your letter of the 2nd instant, I am directed by the School Management Committee of the Board to inform you that they regret that they are unable to accede to your request that your Vestry should be furnished with the names and addresses of the scholars attending the Infants' Department of the above school. 1 will make no comment on this refusal, but you will note that no reason is assigned or it. Although I was altogether unprepared for this reply, yet I had made arrangements as far as I could to obtain information lest the list should not reach me in time to be of use at this meeting, and accordingly I sot a staff of Sanitary Inspectors to work to obtain as ful particulars as was possible. I am very pleased to be able to inform you that I have been able to procure considerable information respecting the Islington scholars, and I am, therefore, now able to report that 93 children, who live in houses from which children attend the infants' school, are ill, and that of these 60 are scholars: that there are 48 houses infected, and that in these 73 scholars reside. This information may be relied on as almost absolutely accurate, although I should remark that it does not include the scholars who reside in Clerkenwell. At the meeting of your Committee on the 25th ultimo, the information then available was that 49 houses were infected, and that 78 scholars were excluded in Islington, of whom 35 were ill. Consequently there has been a decrease of 2 in the number of houses invaded, but an increase of 25 in the number of scholars attacked. 105 [1897 I am also able to report that the disease has disappeared from 21 houses which were reported as infected a fortnight ago, while the disease has appeared in 27 new houses. Under these circumstances I have to advise that the schools should not be opened at an earlier date than November 22nd, when I expect that the disease will have shown a marked decrease. The present increase is probably due to the fact that the scholars were infected on the eve of the closing of the school. I have also ascertained from Dr. Glaister, Medical Officer of Health of Clerkenwell, the information that he has 10 cases of illness, and that 5 scholars reported last meeting have recovered, but under the school code they are not yet eligible to return to school. I am, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) A. E. HARRIS, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Islington, 8th November, 1897. It is most sincerely to be hoped that this policy of thwarting the sanitary authority of Islington will now cease. It has been pursued long enough, and has certainly not increased the good name of the School Board in this district. It began with the refusal to put Yerbury Road Board School into a good sanitary condition until costly legal proceedings were incurred, and the Board was mulcted in £5 5s. costs. Then came a similar policy with regard to Hanover Street Schools. Next came the vexatious conduct with respect to Measles in 1896 and finally the matters just reported. This Vestry and its officials are most anxious to work amicably and cordially with those of the School, Board, whatever their position be, believing that such harmony can only tend to the health of the district and the good of the schools, and, therefore, it is trusted that better counsels will prevail on the Embankment, and that the policy of running counter to the desires of this authority in health matters will now be finally given up. Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. There has for a long period been a grave discussion as to the dissemination of these diseases by means of the schools, the latter disease coming in for a large amount of attention, not merely from the medical press but from the Medical Officer of Health to the London County 106 1897] Council and the Medical Officer to the School Board for London. The former has contended that undoubtedly Diphtheria has been influenced by schools, while the latter has stoutly denied that such is the fact. Now first as regards Scarlet Fever. A reference to the ScarletFever Chart, p. 76, shows that from the middle of April to the latter end of September, the curve of the disease for a period of years has gradually and constantly risen. There it is seen that during the month of August, which is the period in which the public elementary schools are closed for the summer holidays, there is no stay to the rise in the curve, from which it might be reasonably argued, if there were no other circumstances to be stated, that the schools could not be a factor in the increase. If, however, we examine the ages of the persons attacked, and divide them into three groups, the pre-school age, 0—3, the school age, 4—14, and the post school age, 14 and upwards, we would expect to find, if the schools were in no way responsible, that the rise in the curve has been effected by an increase of the disease at all these ages. Unfortunately for the schools such is not the case, for an examination of the figures reveal these facts, that whereas the figures for children under the school age, and persons over that age, steadily increase from July to September, those for the school age show a decrease in August, which is followed by an enormous increase in September. Pre-school Age. (0-3.) School Age. (3-14.) Post-school Age. (14 and upwards.) June 98 675 140 July 111 783 168 August 145 778 210 September 158 1,155 189 Here we see that cases among children under the school age increased from 98 in June to 111 in July, to 145 in August, reaching 158 in September; and that at the post school age the 140 cases in June became 168 in July and increased to 210 in August, but fell to 189 in September. What a contrast this is to what occurred at the school age! The cases which increased from 675 in June to 783 in July fell to 778 in August, when the schools were closed, but increased to 1.155 in September when the schools were re-opened. NOTIFIED CASES SCARLET FEVER (Males and Females), 189O-1897. 107 [1897 If the schools were not responsible for this increase, what was? There is no possible answer. During the last seven years 13,293 cases of Scarlet Fever have occurred and their ages have been analysed. Of these 1,497 were below the school age, 9,695 at the school age, and 2,101 above it. The mean weekly number at each age was then taken and a calculation made for each week as to the percentage of cases above or below the mean. These percentage were then charted as seen on the diagram. The diagonal, or light shadings, show the percentages below the mean, and the black shading those above it. It will be noticed that it was not until the last week in June that the mean line was crossed by any age, and that then it was exceeded at all the age periods. The tendency to increase was shown least at the pre-school age, and most at the post school age, while at the school age there was a distinct inclination to increase until the month of August when apparently some influence, the closing of the schools it is suggested, made its effect felt, and kept the percentage down, until at the last week of that month it was only at the mean line. When, however, September was reached, the percentage at once rushed up, until it reached its maximum in the last week of September. Now, strong as these proofs are against the Schools with regard to Scarlet Fever, they will be seen to be much stronger when the case of Diphtheria is considered. Diphtheria. On looking at the chart for this disease (page 79), it will at once be noticed that from the end of June the tendency of the disease was to increase, but when August was reached this was at once checked, so that the cases became fewer and fewer to the end of the month; but once the Schools were re-opened the curve quickly ran up, until in the third week in September, when, the force of the disease being spent, a steady decline, which continued to the end of the year, commenced. The number of cases known in seven years was 1,586, of which 763 were below the school age, 3,436 at the school age, and 1.586 above it. 108 1897] The numbers occurring at each period, on analysing the ages, were found to be as follows:— Months. (4 weeks). Pre-school Age. (0-3). School Age. (3-14). Post-school Age. (14 and upwards). June 56 247 98 July 48 256 136 August 62 247 139 September 49 325 188 At the pre-school age the cases, which were 56 in June, fell to 48 in July, but rose to 62 in August, only, however, to fall to 49 in September. From these figures it is seen, as might be expected, that as the children were not attending the schools their closing or opening would have little or no effect on the increase or decrease of the cases, and therefore it is not surprising to find that in August the cases were more numerous than in either June, July or September. Similarly it will be noticed that at the post-school age the cases increased from June to September, although the increase was not very great in August. But when the school age is examined the cases of the disease, which were 247 in June, and increased to 256 in July, ultimately reaching to 325 in September, were only 247 in August when the schools were closed for the annual holiday. The general tendency of the disease at all ages was to increase from June to September as the following figures for each of four weeks conclusively prove:— June 401 cases. July 440 „ August 448 „ September 542 „ From June to July the increase was 11.7 per cent., from July to August only 1.9 per cent., and from August to September 22.7 per cent., while the increase from June to September was 35.1 per cent. The small increase in August was entirely due to the decrease of the cases at the school age, at which period, if the percentage increase from June to July had been maintained, the cases should have numbered 514, instead of 448 as we have seen. NOTIFIED CASES DIPHTHERIA (Males and Females), 1890-1897. 109 [1897 The cases at the pre-school age fluctuated considerably from the mean from the beginning of the year up to the first week in June, having been on eleven occasions above it, and on a similar number of occasions below it. Thence to the middle of September they were with three exceptions below it, and it was not until the end of that month that they began to be stable, and then they showed their greatest maximum. On the other hand at the post school age the cases were with two exceptions below the mean line up to the third week in July, from which period, with one exception, to the third week of December, they were above it. It will be particularly noticed that in August they were always above the mean, although irregularly so. Now the cases at the School Age were almost, without exception, below the weekly mean during each week of the first four months of the year, from which period until the end of July there was a strong tendency to increase, so that the curve instead of being almost constantly below the mean was no less than five time} above it. This effort to rise was, however, cut short in the first week in August, from which time to the end of the first week in September it was below the mean line; and thence to the end of the year, it was, with the exception of two weeks constantly above it. This is well seen by the strongly marked notch on the accompanying chart. It is remarkable that the disease did not increase until the first week in September was over, a fact which may be understood if allowance is made for the period which it requires for incubation. It could not be expected that the disease would show itself until a sufficient time had elapsed for it to follow its natural and usual course, and as from 2 to 7 days is the acknowledged period of incubation it was to be anticipated if the Schools were really a means of spreading diphtheria that it would show itself among the scholars as soon as this period had expired. It has done so, and consequently it seems most reasonable to conclude that Schools are a very considerable factor in its propagation. For this reason, then, it behoves all the teachers of the elementary schools to be most careful to exclude scholars about whom there is the least suspicion of a throat ailment, as well as scholars who come from 110 1897] houses in which the disease is known to have occurred. They have most excellent rules laid down for their guidance in the Code of Regulations of the School Board, and it is a great pity that they do not rigorously follow them. If they did such a case as came under notice recently would not have occurred. Two children, who were competing for medals, for which they seem to have had a very good chance, lived in a house in which a case of diphtheria had been treated for a week before its true character had been diagnosed. The Medical Attendant then notified it and at once information was sent to the School. Now, according to the Code, children living in the house should have been excluded for at least a week after the disinfection of the premises had been certified by the Medical Officer of Health, but the teacher, instead of following this wise precaution, had the children to the School, so that they might not lose their rewards. It is true that they were placed in a class-room by themselves, but it is also a fact that the class-room was used by others when they had gone. Now if these children had at this time been going through the incubation period of the disease, it was not impossible that they might have infected the air of the room, and so been the means of conveying the disease to other children. In any case it was very wrong that they should have been received into the School before the teacher had been satisfied that the regulations, which she ought to have obeyed, had been complied with. Both teacher and parents, the former especially, are deserving of severe censure for their conduct. The prizes may have been very much desired for these children, who were in every way estimable, but they would have been very dearly earned if they had been obtained at the cost of an outbreak of diphtheria in the School, particularly as this disease is so fatal to those whom it attacks. FATALITY FROM INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Out of 2,907 cases of Infectious Disease notified to the Medical Officer of Health, 1,620 were treated in hospitals, and 1,287 in their own homes. Of the hospital cases 7.8 per cent. died and of those treated at home 10.2 per cent., the total fatality being 8.8 per cent.

In the succeeding Table information is given as to trades and businesses carried on in houses in which infectious diseases have appeared. A glance at it will be sufficient to show that diseases of the character mentioned would be likely to spread widely from such places if prompt precautions were not taken on the notification being made. This is especially the case in houses where dressmaking and allied trades are conducted, for it can be understood how easily infection can be carried in clothing. The Factory and Workshops Act of 1895 very wisely provided against this by making it an offence to allow wearing apparel to be made, cleaned, or repaired in premises in which Small Pox or Scarlet Fever had appeared. This clause has on many occasions been a most potent assistance in preventing persons continuing to carry on work while a person suffering from Scarlet Fever remained in the house.

The deplorable state of vaccination in Islington was fully dealt with in the Return of the Medical Officer of Health for the third quarter of the year, and, therefore, it is not proposed to discuss the matter again. It, however, becomes necessary to place on record in this report the condition which prevailed up to the end of 1896. The figures for 1897 are not yet available, but this much may be said to a certainty that they will not show any improvement on those of the preceding year. The succeeding table gives a full statement of the statfe of vaccination in the Parish and in London since 1880. Table XCV.

There was a considerable falling off in the number of articles removed from houses for disinfection at the Vestry's Disinfecting Chambers at Seven Sisters Road. This was chiefly due to the decrease in the number of cases of infectious diseases notified, as well as to the less virulent character of the diseases themselves. The following statement gives the particulars for last year, as well as for the preceding year:- 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter. The Year. 1896.

The important duty of removing house refuse was most excellently performed by the staff of men and horses which the Vestry has placed under the superintendence of Mr. Wroot. It would be difficult for this work to be carried out in a more satisfactory manner or with less 138 1897 friction with the public. The weekly removal of dust is now so quietly effected that even those persons who were most opposed to it when it was recommended in 1892 by the Medical Officer of Health must be satisfied that the public have no real grievance. Facts speak louder than words, and therefore to mention that in 1891 10,838 applications were made to have dust removed from the people's homes and that in 1897 there were only 312 is to prove that the work was most admirably done. The present scheme was begun on June 17, 1895, and at once good results were noticeable, as the following figures show:— 1891 10,138 applications made to remove dust. 1892 9,964 ,, ,, 1893 4,986 „ „ 1894 4,506 „ „ 1895 2,506 „ „ 1896 245 ,, ,, 1897 312 ,, ,, The success of the scheme will be better understood when it is stated that there are 44,853 separate assessments in the district, and that the proportion of complaints to every 100 assessments was only 0.695. This is surely one of the greatest sanitary reforms that has ever been effected in Islington, and one on the execution of which the Vestry can justly pride itself. Full particulars of the manner in which the scheme is worked were given in the Medical Officer of Health's Annual Report for 1895. WORKSHOPS. The good character of the work effected by the Workshop Inspectors was fully maintained during the year, the total inspections made being 2,741 and the re-inspections 3,979. A glance at the following short summary of some of their work shows at once its usefulness. 139 1897 Workrooms— Inspected 2318 Overcrowded 15 Badly ventilated 13 Dirty 195 Workshops— Newly discovered 300 Reported by H.M. Inspector 139 Removed from Register 87 Workroom cards distributed 184 Notices to abate nuisances served 238 Works carried out— Ventilation provided 107 Rooms cleansed 375 Yards, Floors and Roofs repaired 295 W.C.'s constructed 34 Urinals 1 W.C.'s supplied with water 108 Water Cisterns for general use provided 6 „ „ cleansed 16 Water laid on 1 It is a very significant fact, and one that speaks louder in praise of their work than any comment that can be made on it, that hardly a murmur is now ever heard from work-people as to the conditions under which they are compelled to labour, whereas a few years ago complaints were very numerous. The reports of the Inspectors will be read with interest, especially that of Miss Gray. To A. E. Harris, Esq., The Vestry Hall, Medical Officer of Health. Islington, 3rd February, 1898. Sir, I have the honour of submitting to you a report of my work during the year 1897. Registers.—There are now on the Workshop and Laundry Registers 752 workshops where females are employed, and 196 workshop laundries, making a total of 948 workshops, &c., and 1,582 workrooms. 140 1897 I append a table giving particulars as to the trades carried oil in the different workshops. Two hundred and twenty-nine workshops containing 280 workrooms have been added to the registers during the year; 87 workshops have been removed from them, owing to various causes, such as:—the giving up of the business, removal from the Parish, or the introduction of machinery into laundries. I have notified to the Homo Office the addresses of 138 workshops not previously visited by H.M. Inspectors of Factories. Inspections.—I have inspected 1,361 workshops, containing 2,302 workrooms, and I have made 1,320 calls and re-inspections, in reference to work being carried out under notice, &c. The above figures include 13 inspections of the three public lavatories for women, as well as visits paid to the homes of outworkers and the smaller laundries. Cleanliness.—I found 113 workrooms in a dirty condition. These have been cleansed and whitewashed. Mora than half of those rooms were washhouses and ironing rooms in laundries, where the steam combining with the dust from the stoves makos frequent whitewashing a necessity. Notices for cleansing in laundries have usually been accompanied by notices asking for repairs in floors, ceilings or walls. In one case the house was so dilapidated that the tenants had to leave before any repairs could be carried out. Ventilation.—In six workrooms I found that the means of ventilation was inadequate In these rooms additional ventilators have been provided. Every winter the difficulty of sufficiently ventilating the workrooms recurs. There is great need for hygienic education for the women and girls employed, to rouse them to do their share in keeping the rooms in a healthy condition. Overcrowding.—I found eleven workrooms to be overcrowded. In these the number of persons at work has been reduced. As the overcrowding occurred during the busy season, additional accommodation was, as a rule, provided for the extra hands. Six of the overcrowded workrooms were among those that were " newly discovered" during the year. I have distributed 184 workroom cards stating the number of persons who may be employed in each room. In comparing the figures of my previous reports with those of this year, it will observed that there has been a steady decrease in the number of cases of overcrowding discovered during inspection. The figures are :— In the 7 months ending 31st December, 1895, there were 29 cases reported. ,, 12 „ 31st December, 1896, „ 27 ,, „ 12 „ 31st December, 1897, „ 11 „ Before the amount of cubic space required per head in workshops was definitely stated by the Factory Act of 1895, many employers were very much in the dark as to what constituted overcrowding. One dressmaker frankly told mo that, in the season, she always had as many workers as Bhe could possibly seat in her room, without troubling as to whether it was overcrowded or not, and many others seem to have acted on the same 141 1897 principle. Now when each workroom has to be measured and to have a notice affixed, as to the number of persons who may be employed, no one can err through ignorance. No doubt the liability to a visit from an inspector is an aid to some in resisting the temptation to overcrowd. Sanitary Defects.—In the course of inspection I have discovered and reported to you the existence of 329 nuisances, liable to be dealt with under the Public Health Act. I have served 111 intimation notices and have supervised the abatement of 181 nuisances. The following is a table of the workshops in which women are employed, and which I visited during the year.

To A. E. Harris, Esq., Vestry Hall, Medical Officer of Health. Ppper Street, Islington, January, 1898. Dear Sir, I have much pleasure in submitting to you a report of my work during the year 1897. I have paid 4,080 visits to factories, workshops, &c.,in the Parish, viz.:—1,421 inspections and 2,659 re-inspections, and have measured 97 workshops and workrooms; 131 notices have been served for the abatement of various nuisances, 34 new w.c's have been provided, whilst a total of 1,438 other improvements have been carried out under my supervision. You will observe by the above figures that much has been done to improve the sanitary condition of workshops for the benefit of the workers, although I am of opinion there still remains a large number of improvements to be carried out in the various other workplaces which will be visited and reported on in due course. Bakehouses.—During the year 702 visits have been paid to bakehouses, of which 258 have been limewashed. I find the occupiers very anxious to do their utmost to keep the places in a good sanitary condition. Miscellaneous Trades.—As this column in the accompanying table does not give full particulars, it may be well to mention that it includes:— Organ Builders. Pianoforte String Makers. Dressmakers. Box Makers. Laundries. Engineers. Tin-box Makers. Paper Sorters. Paper-bag Makers. Rag Sorters. Furriers. Cabinet Makers. Printers. Bedstead Makers. Smoke Nuisances.— 879 visits have been paid by me during the year in various localities in the Parish, for the purpose of taking observations of chimneys of factories and workshops, and in four cases it has been found necessary to take legal proceedings against the offenders, the result being that a penalty was inflicted in each case. Special.—In addition to the numbers quoted in visits paid to workshops, &c., in my report I paid 178 visits by your instructions to private houses with reference to the recent serious outbreak of Measles in the district. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE WEST, Inspector of Workshops, &c. Table XCIX. Summary of Inspector West's work from 4th January, 1897 to 1st January, 1898. DESCRIPTION OF WORK.

There were 393 houses on the register as against 412 in 1896, consequently the registered houses have decreased by 19. • No. of houses on register in 1896 412 Taken off register. 35 Actual number 377 Placed on register during 1897 16 393 This is a matter for regret as, undoubtedly, registration protects the occupiers against the supineness of the owners in remedying sanitary defects, and also secures the latter against the carelessness, and, sometimes, the misconduct of the occupiers. Inspector Jordan has drawn attention to the fact that in many houses there are no persons appointed for their care, and that, consequently, each occupier is practically a law unto himself. This state of affairs certainly requires amendment, and it is sincerely to be hoped that at no distant date power may be obtained, under by-laws, to compel persons, who let their properties in tenements, to at least appoint one of their tenants as caretaker. There does not seem to be much difficulty about this, nor would the cost be much, as no doubt many a respectable lodger would be quite content to undertake the charge on the condition that there was some small reduction in his rent. This loss to the owner would soon be much more than compensated for by the lessened damage to his property. The work of registration is now being actively carried on in most districts in London, and, therefore, it behoves this Parish, which has always been a pioneer in useful work, to keep its place. At present there are not 600 houses of all classes unlet, and hardly a single house of the class which is usually let in tenements to the working classes. These facts are pregnant with meaning, for they signify overcrowding, and overcrowding leads to dirt and disease, poverty and squalor. Great difficulty is experienced even now in abating overcrowding, because when a notice is served on a family, consisting of, perhaps, 6 or 7 persons, it means that they are to provide themselves with a room or rooms elsewhere, in which the number of cubic feet of air space will be K 146 1897 sufficient for their numbers. Such accommodation is difficult to obtain, and, consequently, it is not an infrequent occurrence to find the unfortunate people seeking for lodgings for weeks before they can find them. The state of affairs in Islington at the present moment points to the necessity of further houses being put on the register, and to the appointment of an additional Inspector. Public Health Department, Vestky Offices, Upper Street, N. To A. E. Harris, Esq., Medical Officer of Health, Dear Sir, In submitting to you my report on the works for the year carried out under my supervision according to Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, in respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by more than one family, I must confess that the position of Inspector is not a bed of roses, the habits of the people, and the fact that there is no one in the greater number of houses who is responsible for the condition of the closets, yards, and staircases (as is in the case of the ordinary Common Lodging House) makes his work a constant warfare. In most cases an agent collects the rents, and he only allows as little expense to be incurred as possible so as to show a good return. But the people themselves are sometimes very careless and destructful, so that they sometimes cause great expense to the owner. A case in point: I had a drain reconstructed at a house in Campbell Road, and two days after the completion of the work one of the new closets was stopped. On opening up, the bladebone of a shoulder of mutton was found in the trap. The closet was reinstated, and the next week the pan of the same closet was broken. I tried to find out who had caused the damage, but was not able to collect any satisfactory evidence so as to summons the offender. Of course the greater part of the houses on the register are occupied by the poorer class and owned by people who do not take much interest in them. During the year I have made 3,785 inspections, 1,150 re-inspections and calls, and have had 1,471 improvements carried out on 720 premises, a detailed statement of which is added hereto. There were 7 prosecutions of which 6 were successful, one being dismissed on account of my not having personally seen over 12 persons in the house at one time, although I knew as a fact they were there. The Magistrate, however, held that this was necessary to obtain a conviction under the By-law as to closet accommodation. In the other cases £6 5s. was obtained as penalties and £2 12s. as costs. Nine more houses were put on the Register during 1897, and if more are to be added in the future it will be impossible for one Inspector to cope with the work. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, JAMES J.

The work performed by the District Sanitary Inspectors was very creditable to them as a staff, and showed an increase on that which they had effected in the preceding year. As many as 7,688 houses were inspected, which entailed 57,297 subsequent visits to ascertain if the nuisances were being abated in an efficient manner. The following Table sets forth the particulars of the inspections. Table C. Giving a Summary of the Sanitary Work performed by theInspectors in 1897. Places Inspected. QUARTERS. The Year. First.

From these reports it has, however, been ascertained that 21,234 sanitary improvements have been- effected on the service of notices; in addition to which many others, of which no record was kept, were, on verbal instructions being given to the owners of the properties, dealt with. A brief summary of these reports is interesting. The full reports have been laid before the Public Health Committee. District 1.—Inspector Cook writes in a well ordered report— («) That he investigated 229 cases of infection. (b) That owing to the New River Co. substituting a constant for an intermittent supply in his district 241 notices from builders, intimating their intention of fixing flushing cisterns to W.C.'s, were received ; and that this entailed a considerable amount of work, because in nearly every instance the W.C.'s had to be reconstructed. (c) That 88 complaints of nuisances received at the Vestry were inquired into. (d) That he made house to house inspections with respect to 16 premises. (e) That he inspected 531 houses and made 4,836 re-inspections. (/) That in making these inspections he discovered 2,008 nuisances for the abatement of which he served 425 notices. (g) That he took 62 samples of Food and Drugs for analysis, of which 5 were not genuine, and that in the resulting prosecutions £2 10s. in fines and £4 12s. in costs were allowed the Vestry. (A) That 180 rooms were disinfected and cleansed, and that 178 lots of bedding, etc., were removed for disinfection. 150 1897 (f) That in only 3 instances was it found necessary to summon property • owners, in 2 of which the work was completed before the summonses were heard. (J) That 2 builders were summoned for fixing W.C.'s before giving notice to the Vestry, and that one was fined 2s. 6d. and 2s. costs, and the second 20s. and 8s. costs. He then gives a complete list of the 2,008 nuisances discovered, and the 3,024 improvements effected in 629 premises. District 2.—Inspector Cowling gives a very full report of his work in a document which in many ways is interesting. He states— (a) That he inspected 866 premises, served 405 intimation notices, 13 statutory notices, and made 3,892 calls and re-inspections, and effected 2,465 improvements in 417 houses. (b) That he took out 20 summonses under the Sale of Food and Drugs, Margarine, and Public Health Acts, and that penalties to the amount of £103 16s. were obtained. (c) That 343 cases of infectious diseases were investigated, and that in every case cleansing of the rooms and the disinfection of the bedding, etc., were carried out to his satisfaction. (d) That 8 summonses were issued against persons under sec. 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, for allowing 8 houses situate in Dresden and Cheverton Roads to be occupied without first having received a certificate as to having a proper and efficient water supply, and that penalties to the amount of £3 5s. with 16s. costs were inflicted. (e) That 4 persons were summoned for contravention of L.C.C. by-laws, and that penalties to the amount of 17s. 6d. were awarded to the Vestry. (/) That he paid a considerable number of visits to shops and store-rooms where food was deposited for sale, but succeeded in only 2 instances in finding any article that was unfit for food. 151 1897 (g) That be purchased 66 samples of food for analysis, of which 8 were adulterated, and that in each case the offender was prosecuted, convicted, and fined, with one exception, where ho had absconded, and for whose arrest a warrant was issued. He was one of the " Welsh Gang." (h) That he inspected each of the cow-houses and slaughterhouses three times, and found them in a very satisfactory state. (i) That the removal of manure from tram and bus stables has been a source of trouble to him and au annoyance to people in the neighbourhood in which they are situated, as it has been carried out in a perfunctory manner, "and will continue to be a nuisance so long as the law permits the depositing of manure into receptacles* and the removal of the same through the public streets in the day time. The removal should be effected under the same restrictions as fish offal. In three yards there are housed 1,500 horses." (j) That the past year has been one of very hard work, for which the present system of giving work to unskilled men is to a large extent responsible, owing to the constant necessity of supervising their work. He goes on to say that "although some of the builders, and many of the men, are fairly well educated in their work the majority are still in a state of ignorance as to the practice and principles of plumbing and sanitation, in consequence of which my work is considerably increased." District 3.—Inspector Ward in his instructive report states:— (a) That he hus made 519 inspections and 3,458 re-inspections, paid 13 visits to slaughter-houses, 34 visits to stables and j'ards, and made 48 calls under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, or altogether a total of 4,072 calls, *By this he means that the manure should be loaded into properly constructed vans as soon as removed from the stalls. In this way the terrible nuisance created by the turning over of docaying manure would be avoided.—A.E.H. 152 1897 (b) That the number of nuisances found were 1,117, for the abatement of which 218 notices have been served. Also that he had very little trouble in getting them abated, and that the number of improvements effected has been 1,885 in 227 premises. (c) That the infectious diseases in his district have been decreasing, a circumstance which he.ascribes to the drainage of the schools and houses in which disease has occurred having been thoroughly overhauled and put into a sanitary condition. (d) That, with the exception of a few cases where the Medical Attendant has certified that it has been carried out to his satisfaction, the disinfection of premises after infectious disease has been thoroughly done; and that 112 lots of bedding, etc., have been removed for disinfection, and that no complaint has been received as to their injury. (<) That he purchased 48 samples of food for analysis, of which several were adulterated, and that proceedings were taken against the vendors. That he also procured 36 samples of milk from the churns delivered at Finsbury Park Station of the Great Northern Railway by the 1.30 a.m. train, of which only a small percentage was adulterated. District 4-—Inspector Grivelt., in a brief report, states :— (а) That 876 visits were made respecting 346 cases of notifiable infectious diseases, 200 cases of measles (of whirh 39 died), and 330 complaints. (б) That 2,649 improvements were effected in 504 houses, and that 5,097 visits were paid while the works were in progress. Also that he paid 154 visits to stable-yards. (c) That in 30 instances legal proceedings were taken under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the by-laws, and that £32 5s. 6d. in penalties were obtained. (d) That 58 samples were taken under the Food and Drugs Act, of which 12 were adulterated. That 11 convictions 153 1897 were obtained, one case dismissed, and that £12 4s. were awarded to the Vestry in penalties and costs. (e) That of 346 cases of infectious diseases 85 per cent, occurred in that portion of the district north of Seven Sisters Road, which he attributed to the laxity of parents in isolating the first cases reported, prior to their removal to hospital. District 5.—Inspector Flood sent in a well-written, clearly expressed, and concise report, showing the work performed by him during the year. It is here printed in full: — Vestry Hall, Upper Street, Islington, N.

(J) That he had 1 cow-house re-drained. (g) That in making a house to house inspection, he was in one instance refused admission; that the offender was summoned to Clerkenwell Police Court, that he then gave permission and that on an inspection being made of his house, the w.c. and drain were found to be defective.

(J) That these 21 blocks of model dwellings require constant supervision as to overcrowding, dirt and the state of the sanitary conveniences. (k) That the drainage in his district has been greatly improved, as many houses have been redrained. (l) That when there is an exceptionally heavy fall of rain the sewers get full in the lower part of the district, and that the basements in Wilton Square and Dame Street are consequently flooded, but that he is preventing percolation into the ground under the basements by getting the drains made water-tight.

(/) That he purchased 47 samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, of which only 5 were adulterated, and that convictions were obtained in the cases of 3 milks, 1 cocoa, and 1 butter.

(c) That 215 cases of infectious disease were notified in his district, and that he made the neeessary inquiries. (d) That amongst the legal proceedings he had in the case of the Vestry v. Barker attended the Clerkenwell Police Court on 13 occasions, " the case having been adjourned time after time, apparently in the hope that the defendant would comply or that the Vestry would tire of taking the case to Court. As neither of these happened, the case was adjourned sine die," and the nuisance still exists. (e) That he attended North London Police Court in support of summonses against 12 persons for selling beet crystals as Demerara Sugar, and that convictions followed on all summonses. 161 [1897 L Table CI.

During the year 863 samples of drugs and foods, and 40 samples of margarine, were procured for analysis. 98 of the former, or 11.3 per cent., were returned by the Public Analyst (Dr. F. L. Teed) as being adulterated, whilst 13 samples of margarine were sold in contravention of the Act. In the following statement will be seen the result of the analysis for each quarter:— No. of Samples. Genuine. Adulterated.
