THE BOARD OF WORKS for the St Giles District GENERAL REPORT The Past Year, This Report embraces the period from the 26th day of March, 1895, to the 25th day of March, 1896. During this period 83 Meetings of the Board and Committees have been held, of which the following are the particulars:— Board Meetings— Ordinary 19 Special 2 Total 21 Committee Meetings— Finance 20 Law and Parliamentary 4 Sanitary 15 Works 21 Special 2 Total 62 Making in all a total of 83 9 Changes in the Personnel of the Board. Considerable changes have taken place in the Membership of the Board daring the year under review. At the election of Members in June, 1895, Messrs. Arthur Roger Carter, Charles Fitz-Roy Doll, Robert William Dibdin, Nolan Glave, Samuel Clewin Griffith, John Grafton Izard, Alfred Marshall Jay, Alfred James Jackson, and Joseph Walter Tacon, were elected in the place of Messrs. William Elliott Brooks, Charles Bussell, Alfred Samuel Gubb, James Haxell, Hugh Frederick Jackson, John Francis Staines, Richard Stapley, Joseph Truslove, and Philip Vallentine. Three vacancies have occurred during the year, two of which were caused by the death of John Horseley Mayo, Esq., and Dr. John Waters, the other by the resignation of Gilbert Smith, Esq. Mr. Mayo had been some time a Member of the Board, and at the time of his death was Chairman of the Law and Parliamentary Committee. Dr. Waters had not, owing to ill-health, been able to take an active part in the proceedings of the Board since his election. Mr. Gilbert Smith had been a Member of the Board for over twenty-one years, and at the time of his resignation was serving for the second time as Chairman of the Finance Committee; on receiving the announcement of his resignation, the Board unanimously passed a Resolution expressing their regret, and recording their appreciation of the services which he had rendered. During the year the death of a former Member of the Board was also reported—viz., that of William Henry Hewitt, Esq. In the Report for the year ended 25th March, 1894, reference was made to the fact that Mr. Hewitt did not seek re-election at the expiration of his term of office, and special reference was then made to the fact that 10 Mr. Hewitt had been a Member of the Board ever since its constitution in the year 1855, and was known as the father of the Board. On receiving the report of his death, which took place on the 21st September, 1895, the following Resolution was passed:— "The Board have received with feelings of great regret the news of the death of their late colleague, William Henry Hewitt, Esq., and they desire to offer to Mrs. Hewitt and the members of the late Mr. Hewitt's family their sincere sympathy in their bereavement, and at the same time to express how deeply indebted the District is to the late Mr. Hewitt for the services rendered to it by him with such success for so many years." The Work of the Year. In the succeeding pages a brief summary of the many varied and important matters which have engaged the attention of the Board will be reproduced, but in the limited space at disposal it is quite impossible to convey an accurate impression of the work carried out; this can alone be gauged by those who have an intimate acquaintance with the internal working of the system and by reference to the bound volumes of Minutes of the Board's proceedings. At the first meeting of the Board after the election of Members in June, 1895, George Philip Willoughby, Esq., J.P., was re-elected Chairman, a vote of thanks to him for the manner in which he had discharged the duties of Chairman during the previous year having been passed at a Meeting of the Board on the 28th May, 1895. The result of printing the Minutes of the Meetings of the Board has continued to give the greatest satisfaction, and the bound volumes of the year's proceedings facilitate 11 reference by Members to matters which otherwise might pass out of their recollection. Accounts. The Accounts of the Board for the year under review have been prepared in the same form as heretofore, and after being checked by the Board's Chartered Accountant, have been investigated by the elected Auditors, whose certificate of the result of their examination will be found appended at the foot of the Accounts on page 44. The comparative Statement of Income and Expenditure which has been published during the last few years has been again prepared, and is as follows:— COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENDITURE For the years ending 25th March, 1895, and 25th March, 1896.

There have been three elections of Library Commissioners during the past year. At the annual election in June, 1895, Messrs. Martin Deed, John Forbes Robertson and George Watson Haines were elected Commissioners. 13 In the month of October, 1895, in consequence of the resignation of Mr. Gilbert Smith, an election took place which resulted in the appointment of Mr. J. Bamford Slack in his place, and in the month of January, 1896, in consequence of the resignation of Mr. Martin Deed, LieutColonel Gardiner was elected a Commissioner. The Public Library in High Holborn was completed during the year and opened to the Public by the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor on Wednesday the 4th March, 1896. The work of the Commissioners is specially dealt with in their Report which is published as a separate document, of which copies may be obtained by any ratepayer on application at the Public Library. London Government. In the month of December, 1895, a communication was received from the London County Council inviting the Board to appoint representatives to attend a Conference between representatives of the Council and Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis to consider and report wha t powers now possessed by the Council should be transferred to the Local Authorities. This communication was sent in consequence of a resolution passed by the Council expressing the opinion that it was desirable to forthwith take steps to facilitate the carrying into effect of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the amalgamation of the City and County of London, one of which was that no duties should be thrown upon the Central Authority which could be equally well performed by the Local Authorities. In response to this invitation the Board appointed the Chairman and Mr. 14 Alfred Deed, together with the Clerk to the Board, to represent them. Up to the end of the year now under review four meetings of the Conference had been held, at each of which Sir Arthur Arnold, the Chairman of the Council, had presided. The subjects discussed were matters of considerable detail and great importance, and it is hoped that after the amount of time devoted to the subject some good will result from the deliberations of the Conference. No steps have been taken upon the Report of the Royal Commission upon the question of London Government. Equalisation of Rates. Under the London Equalisation of Rates Act, 1894, it was provided that a census should be taken in the year 1896. The date for this was fixed by the RegistrarGeneral for the night of Sunday, 29th March. Some little time must elapse before the result will be made known; it is, however, anticipated that so far as the St. Giles District is concerned a decrease in the population will be shown to have taken place : if this is so, the result will be that the contribution from this District, which is already heavy, will be increased. Metropolis Water Act, 1871—Water Waste Preventing Cisterns. In the year 1892, the Board passed a Resolution in favour of an increase in the capacity of water waste preventing cisterns, and applied to the Local Government 15 Board to take the necessary steps in the matter. The communication was referred to the London County Council, who in the main concurred in the Board's suggestions, and in the month of November last an Inquiry was held by Colonel W. M. Ducat, pursuant to Section 19 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, at which the Board was represented by the Members Messrs. Blott, Cooper and Doll and its officers. The Inquiry lasted several days, and resulted in a Report being presented to the Local Government Board recommending that there was no necessity for an alteration of the Regulations in question. Proposed New Street from High Holborn to the Strand. Proposals for the construction of a new Street from High Holborn to the Strand have again engaged the attention of the London County Council during the year, but although the Improvements Committee of the Council have brought up proposals for consideration, no scheme has yet been formulated, notwithstanding that it is recognised that there is a pressing necessity for the improvement being immediately carried out. Metropolis (Shelton Street, St. Giles) Provisional Order Confirmation Act, 1891. Proposals for the further modification of the scheme for dealing with this area were under consideration during the year, but in consequence of the complexity of the questions and the serious expenditure which any further modification 16 would involve the steps proposed have been abandoned, and the London County Council are now proceeding with the work of erecting dwellings on the remainder of the site. Improvements. During the past year two minor improvements in the District have been carried out. They consisted of the laying out of the new thoroughfare on the site of Caroline Mews and the removal of the dwarf railings in Great Russell Street, in front of the British Museum. The improvement in Caroline Mews was effected under an arrangement between the Board and His Grace the Duke of Bedford, and has resulted in the provision of an important thoroughfare of 62 feet wide, in place of the old Mews, which was only 13 feet wide at the two entrances, and 29 feet at the widest part. The necessary land was provided by the Duke of Bedford. and the work of paving the carriage-way executed by the Board. The improvement in Great Russell Street was also due to an arrangement made on behalf of the Duke of Bedford with the Trustees of the British Museum, the Duke, when selling certain of his property for the purposes of the British Museum, having stipulated that on the completion of the purchase the dwarf railings on the northern side of Great Russell Street and at the southern end of Montague Street should be taken down and the land thrown into the public-way, the works being executed by the Board. 17 Bozier's Court, Tottenham Court Road. The desirability of the block of buildings standing between Bozier's Court and Tottenham Court Road being removed has been for many years before the Board, and representations have continually been made to both the Metropolitan Board of Works and the London County Council upon the matter. Ultimately, after rejecting several suggestions, the London County Council have determined to proceed with the work, and have directed application to be made in the forthcoming Session of Parliament for the necessary powers. London Sea-Water Supply Bill. This was a Bill introduced with the object of authorising the construction of works for supplying Sea Water to certain parts of London and other places, and for other purposes. The form in which the Bill was introduced was such that it was necessary for the Board, in order to obtain the insertion of clauses for the protection of the interests of the District, to present a Petition against the same. Negotiations having ensued between the promoters and the Board's officers, resulted in the insertion of protective clauses, and the Board's opposition to the Bill was withdrawn. At the time of preparing this Report it had passed through the House of Commons, and was awaiting consideration in the Upper House of Legislature. Belasyse Monument, St. Giles Churchyard. The monument to the memory of the Right Hon. Lord John Belasyse, erected against the east wall of St. Giles c 18 Church, having become dangerous, and being, in the opinion of the Board's officers, incapable of repair, has, with the sanction of the Ecclesiastical Authorities, and in pursuance of a Faculty, been removed. The tablet bearing the inscription has been placed in the entrance to St. Giles Church and the remaining portion of the monument buried in the churchyard. Previous to the removal of the monument a photograph of the same was taken by the Board's instructions and has been placed in the Board Room. Dusting, Slopping, and Watering Contracts. The period for which the Board had entered intocontracts with Mr. George Cookson, for the removal of house refuse and slop, and for watering and washing the streets in the District, expiring at Lady Day, 1896, the Board referred the question of whether the contracts should be renewed or the work done without the intervention of a contractor to a special Committee consisting of the Members of the Sanitary and Works Committees, who held several Meetings and considered the whole subject; and having had laid before them Reports showing the comparative cost of executing the work in the District, and in other districts in London, unanimously recommended the Board not to undertake the work without the intervention of a contractor, but that the system under which the work had been hitherto carried out should, with certain modifications, be adhered to. These recommendations dealt with matters of detail but of great importance, and the whole of them were adopted by the Board, and advertisements having been issued, Mr. Cookson's tender (which was the 19 lowest) for the execution of the services was accepted for three years, and the necessary contracts entered into. In order to procure greater efficiency in the work of street cleansing, the Board have appointed an Inspector of Street Scavenging and Watering. Sanitary Work. A very large number of nuisances have been dealt with, and much work carried out, during the past year. In order that Members may be more fully acquainted with the details of the work carried out, a synopsis of sanitary work is published every month and forwarded to Members of the Board. The following statistics as to the work under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, show the activity which has existed:— Visits and inspections made 11,261 Notices for abatement of nuisances served 1,256 Proceedings before Police Magistrates—fines and costs recovered 34 Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, five representations were made by the Medial Officer of Health, and the necessary steps taken, with a view to closing the premises. The following are the particulars:— Locality. Present Condition of Premises. 55, High Street Demolished. 41, Colonnade do. 18, Drury Lane Closed. 19, do Closed. 188, do. Closed. Undergoing repair. c 2 20 The Analyst's Report, which will be found on page 62, records the number of samples submitted for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Margarine Act. A total of 318 samples were purchased and analysed. Of these 28 were adulterated, but in 7 cases the adulteration was not sufficient to justify any proceedings being taken. In the other cases prosecutions ensued, and fines and costs amounting in the whole to £29 3s. were inflicted. Underground Conveniences. In the last Report reference was made to the contract entered into with Messrs. C. W. Killingback and Co. for the construction of a new underground Convenience at the junction of New Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road. The work was duly completed and the Convenience opened on the 27th September, 1895. The following statement, which was circulated on the occasion of the opening, gives a brief description of the work:— This Convenience for men and women has been constructed by the Board under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, beneath the public-way of New Oxford Street. The superficial area of the Convenience is 1,500 feet. The depth from the level of the surface of the roadway is 14 feet. The men's department is entered from a refuge situate at the north end of Charing Cross Road, and contains 12 •closets, 14 urinals, and 3 lavatories. No charge is made for the use of urinals, but for the water-closets the usual charge of a 1d. for each person is made, and for the lavatories 2d. for each person, including hot water and use of a clean towel. The women's department is approached from a staircase leading from the public footway, to avoid the necessity of crossing the carriage-way, and in it there are 6 closets and 3 lavatories. One of these closets may be used free of charge, for the others 1d. is charged, and for the lavatory 2d. for each person, with hot water and use of clean towel. The work has been designed and executed in accordance with drawings and specifications prepared by Mr. George Wallace, C.E., Engineer to the Board. The contractors 21 were Messrs. C. W. Killingback and Co., of Camden Town. The sanitary arrangements have been carried out by George Jennings, of Palace Wharf, Lambeth. The whole of the internal fittings are of the most modern description; the water-closets being Jennings' syphonic discharge apparatus, "The Closet of the Century," and the urinals are of the radial basin stall pattern. The Convenience is ventilated by means of Blackman's air propeller, worked by water-power, the waste water being used for flushing purposes; the ventilator is placed beneath a refuge formed in the middle of the carriage-way at the north-west end of High 8treet. On each refuge an ornamental ventilating lamp column has been erected. These have been cast by Messrs. Pontifex and Co., of No. 22, Coleman Street, from designs prepared by the Engineer to the Board. The roof of the Convenience is formed with rolled steel girders and trough plates supplied by Messrs. Westwood and Co., Limited, of Millwall, who have also supplied the staircases, which are formed of iron framing fitted with Andrew's patelt reversible treads. The nett cost of the work is about £2,500. Within a very short time after the opening of the Convenience it became apparent that the accommodation provided was insufficient, and the Board has resolved to enlarge it by increasing the number of water-closets for both men and women, and the tender of Messrs. C. W. Killingback and Co. for the execution of the work has been accepted, and it is hoped that the additional accommodation will shortly be available for use. The manner in which these Conveniences are made use of, affords abundant evidence that the expenditure upon them is amply justified. Closing of Princes Court. In the year 1877, the Metropolitan Board of Works prepared a scheme for the improvement of an insanitary area lying between Drury Lane and Great Wild Street, and in pursuance of the powers conferred upon them, closed the whole of the courts running between the two 22 fares, with the exception of Princes Court. On several occasions of late years applications have been made by Messrs. Lambert and Butler, with the consent of adjoining owners, for orders for stopping up this court, and the Board, believing that the court was quite unnecessary, that its continuance was a nuisance, and that it might without inconvenience to the public be discontinued, supported the applications; but it was not until the month of January, 1896, that the Justices consented to make the necessary order, immediately after which the court was discontinued, and a great nuisance has thereby been abolished. Renaming of Streets. The formation of the new thoroughfare between Bloomsbury Street and Tottenham Court Road has already been referred to, and during the year an order has been made by the London County Council for abolishing the old name of Caroline Mews, and for incorporating the new thoroughfare with Tavistock Street, and naming the whole line Bedford Avenue. An Order was also received for the renaming of Brunswick Mews, which is now known as Calsen Yard. A proposal that a name should be applied to the circus formed by the junction of New Oxford Street with Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, Charing Cross Road and High Street, and suggesting the name of St. Giles Circus, was made to the London County Council, but the Building Act Committee declined to entertain the suggestion. 23 Employees' Holiday. In the last Annual Report reference was made to the employees' holiday. The first outing took place on the 7th July, 1894, and having proved so successful the Board during the year again sanctioned the day's holiday, and voted the sum of £10 as an addition to the men's wages. The outing took place on the 6th July, 1895, and was as successful as that on the previous occasion. HENRY C.

The roadway and footways of Charlotte Mews were repaved during the year at the cost of the Duke of Bedford. The cost of the work was £248. The arrangement made between your Board and the Bedford Office some years ago, as to the widening and paving of Caroline Mews, has during the past year been carried out. The original widths at the two ends were 13 feet, the remainder of the Mews being 29 feet in width. The new street formed partly on the site of the old Mews and partly on land taken from the houses on the south side of Bedford Square has now a width of 62 feet 6 inches throughout. Your Board, in accordance with the said arrangement, has paved the roadway with asphalte and formed the necessary gullies; the work of forming and paving the footpaths, erecting lamp-posts and extending the sewer at the western end being performed by the frontagers. The new street is, as was the case with Caroline Mews, maintainable by the Board, and the London 47 County Council have incorporated with it, Tavistock Street, naming the whole line of thoroughfare, from Tottenham Court Road to Bloomsbury Street, Bedford Avenue. Maintenance of Asphalte Carriage-way Pavements. During the year, Contracts were entered into between your Board and the several Contractors who laid the different pavements, for a further maintenance for 15 years of the following streets at the prices named :— King's Arms Yard 4d. per yard superficial per annum. Bernard Street 7d. „ „ Streatham Street 6d. „ „ Great Coram Street, from west side of Little Coram Street to west side of Kenton Street 6d. „ „ Parker Street, from Kenton Street to Little Queen Street 4d. „ „ Bury Street, from New Oxford Street to Hart Street 6d. „ „ Sewers. The following Sewer works were performed during the year:— Hall's Yard 90 feet run new 12in. pipe sewer. Handel Street 200 feet run new 4ft. by 2ft. 6in. brick sewer. Henrietta Mews 230 feet run new 12in. pipe sewer. Hyde Street (late Duke Street) 50 feet run new 12in. pipe sewer. Kennedy Court 70 feet run new 12in. pipe sewer.

So much of the pipe sewer in Henrietta Mews as 48 was within the St. Pancras Parish was by arrangement with that Vestry executed at their expense by the Board's Contractors. The amount received from the St. Pancras Vestry for this work was £88 3s. 6d. For the purpose of obtaining an outlet for Woburn Square (west side) sewer, a portion of the old sewer within the St. Pancras Parish was reconstructed by this Board. Drains. 146 applications were received during the year for the construction of new, and reconstruction or partial reconstruction of existing, drains at 161 private premises within the District. The whole of the work laid was tested by the Board's officials before being covered in; the fees received in respect of the same amounted to £38 10s. Abbey Place. Alfred Mews. Bainbridge Street.

The streets in the above list marked with an asterisk were flushed the whole year round. Street Cleansing. The question of the scavenging and street watering within the District has occupied the attention of your Board E 50 during the year, a proposal being made that the whole of the work of the collection and disposal of house refuse and street sweepings, and the watering of the streets, should be performed by the Board without the intervention of a Contractor, but after giving every consideration to the matter your Board decided to make no alteration in the present system. A re-arrangement of the staff and the work was, however, made, the 28 street orderly boys being discharged, and their places filled by 12 additional men. The staff now employed number 50, consisting of one foreman, five gangers, and 44 sweepers. Your Board also appointed a new Inspector, whose sole duty it is to direct the cleansing and watering of the public-ways. In addition to the manual labour employed, two sweeping machines, drawn by horses, were used in sweeping the carriage-ways. The street sweepings carried away during the year amounted to a total of 6,363 van-loads, equal to over 19,000 cubic yards. There were also removed 1,634 vanloads of refuse matter taken from the gully pits, &c., and 23 van-loads from the sewers, together amounting to over 5,000 yards. The carriage-ways of the main thoroughfares were washed frequently during the year by means of water distributed by watering carts. The cost of this washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter. The main thoroughfares in the District were watered twice on Sundays during the summer months, between the 51 hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., and the market streets between 12 and 2.30 when the condition of the weather rendered it desirable. In the latter watering, disinfectants were added to the contents of the carts. Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for tlie year 1895-6, including the Sunday work, was as follows:— £ s. d. Wages of men and boys 3,055 2 6 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men and boys 622 3 3 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, and hire of horses for street sweeping machines ... 3,679 1 0 Removal of snow—-additional labonr, cartage, &c. 123 1 7 Removal of manure 75 12 0 Water for flushing surfaces of courts, &c. 172 6 2 • £7,727 6 6 Street Watering. The watering of the public-ways was performed by contract, the Contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. A small hand water-cart was employed to water those courts and alleys in the District not available for vehicular traffic, or which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The total quantity of water used, including that used for washing the surfaces of the asphalte and wood paved roads, amounted to 6,260,000 gallons. During the summer months, permanganate of e 2 52 potash was added to the contents of the watering carts, one ounce being used to 400 gallons of water. £ s. d. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs to stand posts, &c., was 285 0 2 To Contractor for horses, carts, and men 1,012 0 0 For permanganate of potash put into the water vans 17 17 0 Total £1 314 17 2 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the district by contract, the Contractor providing all necessary carts, horses and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £3,650. The refuse removed amounted to 9,395 van-loads equal to over 28,000 cubic yards. The disinfection of the dust-bins in the District with carbolic acid powder, after their contents had been removed by the Contractor's men, was continued during the year, the cost of the disinfectant used being £13 6s. Limewhiting Courts. The walls at the entrances to the following yards, courts, mews, &c., in the District, were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year, at a cost of £43 10s. Compton Mews.

The urinal in Bainbridge Street, which had for a considerable time been most objectionable and expensive, has been removed, the result of negotiations with Messrs. Meux and Co., whose premises it adjoined, and the construction of the underground Convenience in New Oxford Street hereafter referred to. The quantity of water used at the whole of the urinals within the District, excluding the two underground Conveniences, during the year was 2,763,000 gallons. The following is a list of the public urinals existing in the St. Giles District:— Colonnade 6 compartments. Dunn's Passage 5 „ Galen Place 3 Lascelles Court 4 ,, Little Guilford Street 4 „ Mtrwell Street 3 „ Parker Street 3 „ Seven Dials 6 „ Short's Gardens 6 „ Southampton Mews 2 „ Torrington Mews 1 „ Whetstone Park 3 „ Underground Convenience. New Oxpoed Street. The new underground Convenience in New Oxford Street, which was referred to in the Board's Annual Report of 1895, was completed and opened to public use on September 27th, 1895. The Convenience has been very largely used since its construction, and the demand for increased accommodation is so great that the Board in 54 April last decided to enlarge it and to form an additional entrance to the men's compartment. The Contract for this enlargement has been let to Messrs. 0. W. Killingback and Co., and the work is now being proceeded with. Underground Convenience, Shaftesbury Avenue. The flowers and shrubs which were placed by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, in the year 1892, against the walls of the staircases at the underground Convenience in Shaftesbury Avenue, were so constantly damaged by mischievous persons, and either from this cause or from atmospheric influences presented at all times so unhealthy and untidy an appearance that the Board resolved to remove the same. One of the objects in placing the shrubs was to obscure the view of the staircase from passers by, and on the removal of the shrubs rough plate-glass was affixed to the railings of the staircases. Improvement, Creat Russell Street. An important public improvement was, by arrangement with the Commissioners of Works, carried out in Great Russell Street and Montague Street, fronting the British Museum, the iron dwarf railings which enclosed a piece of paved land belonging to the Government being removed, and the ground thrown into the public-way. Your Board was thus enabled to considerably increase the width of the footpath and the roadway, and improve the junction of the carriage-way of Great Russell Street with Montague Street. 55 Public Lighting. During the year the Welsbach incandescent light was adopted in certain of the public lamps experimentally, but the result after six months did not, in the opinion of your Board, warrant the continuance of the system, and the incandescent burners were accordingly removed and the old bats wing burners replaced. Fifty additional square lanterns, with the name of the street inserted in the sides, have been substituted for the well lanterns at the junction of certain streets in the District. The total number of public lamps is 1160, made up as under:— Lamp-posts with well lanterns 729 Ditto, with square lanterns 155 Old lamp-posts with square lanterns 13 Metered lamps on street crossing refuges 12 Bracket lamps with well lanterns 147 Ditto, with old square lantern 104 Total 1160 The amount paid for gas, including the lighting and extinguishing, cleansing and maintenance of the lanterns, was £3,990 6s. 4d. Street Orderly Bins, etc. Several additional street orderly bins and ballast bins have been erected during the year; the total number now in the District is given on page 59. 56 Street Nomenclature. Caroline Mews and Tavistock Street have been incorporated by the London County Council as one street, and named Bedford Avenue. Closing of Streets. On the application of the adjoining inhabitants, Princes Court, which was a narrow thoroughfare running between Drury Lane and Great Wild Street, and which for a long time had been complained of, as insanitary, was ordered by the Justices of the Peace to be closed as a public-way. Application to close Clarke's Mews and Hampshire Hog Yard, which formed a line of thoroughfare between High Street and Dyott Street, was made by the owners of the adjacent property, who claimed the freehold of the thoroughfare. The Board, who had for many years maintained portions of the same as public-ways by paving, lighting and sewering the same, resolved after considerable negotiations with the owners to support the application, and an order was eventually made by the Magistrates assenting to the application, and the thoroughfare was given over to the owners and is now maintained by them. New Street, a small cul de sac leading out of the northern end of Dyott Street and abutting on premises belonging to Messrs. Meux and Co., was on their application ordered by the Justices to be discontinued as a publicway, Messrs. Meux and Co., in consideration of the site of the street being given up to them, contributing a sum of money towards the cost of constructing the 57 underground Convenience in New Oxford Street, before referred to. St. Giles Churchyard. The monument erected to the memory of the Belasyse family, abutting on the east wall of St. Giles Church,, was found to be so decayed as to be dangerous to persons walking past it, and the Board, after lengthy consideration and with the assent of the Rector of the church, decided to remove it; the inscription tablet of the monument was placed within the porch of the principal entrance of the church, the remainder of the stones forming the monument being stored away in the vaults under the church. Hydraulic Power Mains. Your Board, on the application of the London Hydraulic Power Company, sanctioned the extension of existing mains belonging to the Company in Tottenham Court Road, Bucknall Street, and Cosmo Place. Street Refuges. A small circular Refuge has been formed during the year in High Holborn, at its junction with Drury Lane and Broad Street. A similar Refuge has since been formed in Gower Street, at its junction with Keppel Street and Store Street. The following list shows the Refuges now existing in the District:— Bedford Place south end. Broad Street east of Endell Street. Charing Cross Road north end, by High Street.

GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you a Report upon the samples submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act during the year ending 31st March, 1896. The total number of samples of food examined during the period was 318. In the two previous years, 1893-94 and 1894-95, the numbers were 266 and 348 respectively. Of the 318 samples, 159 were purchased by Inspector William Henry Bond, and a like number by Inspector John Robinson. In the following table will be found a statement of the articles analysed during each quarter of the year:— ARTICLE. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter. Total. Grand Gen. Adult. Gen.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I beg to present you the Annual Report of the Vital and Mortal Statistics of the St. Giles District for the year ending 31st December, 1895. Area. St. Giles District comprises the two parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury—an area of 245 statute acres. It forms one of the Central Metropolitan Districts, and for civil registration purposes is divided into three subdistricts, viz:— 1. St. George, Bloomsbury. 2. St. Giles, South. 3. St. Giles, North.

The registered births were 269 in excess of the corrected registered deaths. There was one birth to 35'5 inhabitants. The annual birth-rate of the District was equal to 28.1 per 1,000, being 1.3 per 1,000 above the average birth-rate per 1,000 for the ten years 1885-1894. Again the same high birth-rate (42.5) prevailed in St. Giles, South, the chief contributor being the Peabody Buildings, Great Wild Street, where the birth-rate was 41.2 per 1,000. According to the quarterly returns furnished by the Local Registrars, 921,860 births were registered in England and Wales during the year 1895; the natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths was 353,102, the average annual increase in the five preceding years having been 341,501. The birth-rate in England and Wales was 30.3 per 1,000. In Registration London the number of births was 133,715 and the birth rate 30.5 per 1,000. 71 77 Of the total deaths in London last year nearly twentyseven per cent. took place in public institutions, about one in every seven deaths occurred in a workhouse or workhouse infirmary, one in every fifty-three in a metropolitan asylum hospital, one in every eleven in some other hospital, and one in every fifty in a public lunatic or imbecile asylum (annual summary of the Registrar-General).

In order to make the death-rates accurate, the deaths of 196 parishioners in outlying public institutions must be added to the registered deaths in the District, and the deaths of 60 non-parishioners at the French Hospital, the Workhouse and the British Lying-in Hospital, must be deducted. With these alterations the corrected deaths for the Subdistricts are:— St. George, Bloomsbury 247 St. Giles, South 424 St. Giles, North 180 Whole District 851 73 This number is equivalent to an annual death-rate of 21.3 per 1,000, one point below the decennial average. The death-rate of the whole parish of St. Giles-in-theFields was 11.4 per 1,000 higher than that of St. George, Bloomsbury. In England and Wales 568,758 deaths were registered^ corresponding to an annual death-rate of 18.7 per 1,000, an increase of 2.1 per 1,000 on the low rate in the previous year. In Registration London the number of deaths was 86,937, and the death-rate 19.8 per 1,000; the average rate in the previous ten years having been 20.1. Infantile Mortality. In 1895, the deaths of young children under 5 years of age bear a higher ratio to total deaths than in the preceding year. 185 of the infants died under 1 year, and 88 between 1 and 5 years, together 273 deaths. The mortality of infants under 1 year was in the proportion of 165 deaths to 1,000 registered births, and 217 per 1,000 of total deaths, and the mortality of children under 5 years was in the proportion of 320 per 1,000 of total deaths. The diseases which caused the greatest fatality amongst our infantile population were—measles 12, whooping-cough 12, diphtheria 11, diarrhoea 27, scrofula 26, premature birth 32, convulsions 18, bronchitis and pneumonia 61, and general debility 16. 74 Six children were suffocated in bed with their parents, the same number as recorded for the previous year. The infantile mortality for all London, which includes 680 infants under 1 year of age suffocated in bed, is equal to a rate of 166 per 1,000 births. The rate was lowest in the northern group of sanitai'y areas and higher in the central group. Senile Mortality. 173 deaths were recorded at 65 years and upwards these deaths occurred at the following advanced ages:— 61 between 65 and 70 years. 80 „ 70 „ 80 „ 32 „ 80 „ 90 „ 11 ofthedeaths were due to influenza, 19 to heart-disease, 22 to apoplexy and paralysis, 48 to diseases of the respiratory organs, and 34 were certified to have died of "old age," i.e., decay of nature without showing any signs of organic disease. Uncertified Deaths. Every death during the year was certified either by a Registered Medical Practitioner or by the Coroner, this is evidence that the poorest in the District can readily obtain Medical advice and treatment for their sick. In England and Wales there were 13,222, or 2.3 per cent., in which the causes were not so certified. In all London 633, or 0.7 per cent. of the deaths, were uncertified. 75 Deaths in Public Institutions (within the District). 1.—The Workhouse, Endell Street. The average number of inmates in the Workhouse during 1895 was 577. The number of deaths during the four quarters of the year was:— 1st Quarter 82 2nd Quarter 32 3rd Quarter 12 4th Quarter 21 Total 147 This number does not include the 50 deaths of parishioners at Cleveland Street Sick Asylum, removed there from the Workhouse for medical treatment. The annual death-rate was equal to 25.4 per 1,000. The number of cases of infectious sickness notified was:— Enteric Fever 2 Erysipelas 7 Total 9 2.—The French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. The population of this Institution, including staff, servants and patients, at the Census of 1891 was 67. During 1695, there were 38 deaths reported; 35 of these were non-parishioners admitted for treatment from various parts of the Metropolis. Twenty of the deaths were from consumption and diseases of the respiratory organs. No death occurred from zymotic disease. 76 3.—The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. During tlie year, 187 women were delivered in the wards, with no maternal death. This shows the Hospital to be in a very satisfactory condition as regards the sanitary arrangements. The total number of children born was 190, three of the labours resulting in the birth of twins. Four of the children died from congenital malformation and immaturity. In the out-patient department there were 372 deliveries ; in all the cases the mothers did well. There were 9 cases of still-birth, and 10 infants died within 10 days of their birth.

During the year there were 58 births, equal to the 78 high birth-rate of 41.2 per 1,000, and 18 deaths, giving the satisfactory death-rate of 12.7 per 1,000. There were 6 deaths of young children; of these 1 died from a zymotic disease, viz., infantile diarrhœa. One of the total deaths occurred in hospital (King's College). 27 certificates of infectious diseases were received, viz., scarlet fever 19, diphtheria 3, and erysipelas 5. B.—THE LITTLE CORAM STREET BLOCK. Superintendent, Mr. Whenman.

There were 37 children born, equal to a birth-rate of 47.6 per 1,000, a rate of 19.5 above that of the whole District. The 17 deaths corresponded to an animal death-rate of 21.9 per 1,000. 79 12 of the total deaths were children under 5 years of age. There were two infectious deaths, 1 from scarlet fever (died in the North Western Fever Hospital) and 1 from diphtheria (died in Children's Hospital), the zymotic death rate was equal to 3.8 per 1,000. 9 certificates of infectious diseases were received, viz., scarlet fever 4, diphtheria 2, erysipelas 2. The Trustees of the Peabody Donation Fund, in their 31st Annual Report, state that the net gain of the year 1895 from rents and interest was £28,434 9s. 9d., which was £1,560 17s. 10d., below that of 1894. The capital expenditure on land and buildings to the end of the year was £1,250,390 10s. 8d., being an increase of £693 14s. lOd. At the end of 1895 the Trustees had provided for the artizan and labouring poor of London 11,367 rooms, besides bathrooms, laundries and lavatories. These rooms comprise 5,121 separate dwellings, viz., 76 of four rooms, 1,791 of three rooms, 2,436 of two rooms, and 818 of a single room. The number of persons in residence on December 31st was 19,914. The average weekly earnings of the head of each family in residence at the close of the year was £1 3s. 3½d., the average rent of each dwelling being 4s. 9½d. per week, and of each room 2s. 2d. The birth-rate for the year reached 36.9 per 1,000, which is 6'4 per 1,000 above that of all London for the same period. The death-rate incliiding the deaths of 51 inhabitants of the buddings, who were removed to hospitals, was 17.9 per 1,000, which is 1.9 per 1,000 below the average of London. The infant mortality was 151.1 in each 1,000 births, or 14.7 below that of London. 80 2.—Buildings belonging to the Incorporated Society for Improving the Condition of the Working Classes.

The 8 births were equal to an annual birth-rate of 38*6 per 1,000. The 7 deaths corresponded to a death-rate of 33.8 per 1,000. Two of the deaths were those of young children, and 2 occurred between 60 and 80 years. There was one zymotic death from diphtheria at the Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street. Six notifications of infectious diseases were received, viz., scarlet fever 4, and diphtheria 2. Deaths in Certain Classes of Diseases. 1.—Specific, Febrile, or Zymotic Diseases. This class of diseases called "zymotic" comprises six orders, viz.:—1, miasmatic; 2, diarrhceal; 3, malarial; 4, zoogenous ; 5, venereal; and 6, septic. The miasmatic and diarrhoeal orders include the diseases which the Registrar-General describes as the seven principal diseases, being more or less of a preventable g 82 character; the term "fever" includes typhus, enteric, and simple continued forms of fever. During 1895 the deaths from these diseases in England and Wales were 64,901. In Registration London these same diseases caused 11,545 deaths, equal to a zymotic death-rate of 2.6 per 1,000. In St. Giles District there were 77 deaths, equal to a death-rate of 1.9 per 1,000, a rate below that of the previous year. 19 of these deaths occurred in the following hospitals and public institutions situated outside the district:—Ship Atlas, 1 (small-pox); South-Western Fever Hospital, 2 (scarlet 1, enteric 1); Western Fever Hospital, 1 (diphtheria); North-Western Fever Hospital, 6 (diphtheria 2, scarlet 3, measles 1); Children's Hospital 2 (diphtheria); Charing Cross Hospital, 3 (diphtheria); King's College Hospital, 3 (diphtheria); University College, 1 (diarrhœa). MIASMATIC ORDER. 1.—Small-Pox (decennial average, 2.4 per 1,000). In St. Giles District, during the ten years 1885-1894, there were 164 cases reported; 24 of these terminated fatally. No case occurred in the District from August, 1894, until March, 1895. From that date to the 13th August 13 notifications of the disease were received. The patients (with one exception, vide Case 7) were removed to hospital, where one (an adult vaccinated in infancy) died. 83 The following are brief particulars of the several cases:— No. 1, March 19th.—F. B., æt. 16 years, had resided a few days previous to his present illness at 17, Kingsgate Street, Holborn; prior to that at 86, Cromer Street, St. Pancras. No other case of illness was known at either of these houses. No trace could be found that the disease was contracted in this District. No. 2, June 20th.—E. W., aet. 20 years, was picked up ill in the street and taken to the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. This patient was a vagrant Italian who refused to state where he lived. No. 3, July 3rd.—A. H. M., set. 35 years, vaccinated in infancy and recently re-vaccinated, was removed from the Inns of Court Hotel, 268, High Holborn, to the Hospital Ship, where he died shortly after admission. The patient was a solicitor residing at Hereford ; as he had only been a couple of days in London previous to illness the disease could not have been contracted here. The Medical Officers of Health of the Urban and Rural Sanitary Authorities at Hereford knew of no case of small-pox in their respective districts. The wife informed me the only possible clue was that her husband had complained of having come into contact with some very dirty tramps whilst he was out rifle shooting in a field near Hereford. No. 4, July 8th.—H. K., set. 22 years, vaccinated, had slept two nights previous to illness at a common lodginghouse, 20, Queen Street, Dials; before that he had resided for 14 days at a Salvation Army Shelter, Blackfriars Road. G 2 84 No. 5, July 9th.—M. C., set. 29 years, vaccinated, of 6, Betterton Street, Drury Lane, a common lodging-house, where he had resided for some months previous to his illness. No. 6, July 20th.—F. B., ast. 20 years, vaccinated in infancy, residing at a common lodging-house, 20, Queen Street, Dials, was removed in the first instance to the Western Fever Hospital as a case of enteric fever, but on the next day, when the disease was pronounced to be smallpox, the patient was sent on to the Hospital Ship. The disease was evidently contracted from No. 4 Case, H. K., in the same house. No. 7, July 22nd.—A. W., set. 21 years, vaccinated; this patient had a mild attack of the disease which brought on premature labour, rendering her unable to be removed to hospital. No. 8, July 24th.—E. A. C., set. 47 years, vaccinated in infancy, residing in a common lodging-house, No. 6, Betterton Street, Drury Lane, contracted the disease from Case No. 5 in the same house. No. 9, July 25th.—W. R., set. 20 years, vaccinated in infancy; this patient, residing at No. 6, Betterton Street, had been in contact with cases Nos. 5 and 8. No. 10, July 29th.—W. J., set. 35 years, vaccinated, a resident of 6, Betterton Street, was also connected with cases Nos. 5, 8 and 9. No. 11, August 3rd.—H. H., set. 46 years, vaccinated in infancy, residing at No. 189, High Holborn. This man was a market porter in Covent Garden; upon feeling ill he 85 attended as an out-patient at Charing Cross Hospital, where he was detained and sent on to the Hospital Ship. No evidence could be obtained from whence he was infected. No. 12, August 10th.—W. K., get. 20 years, vaccinated, residing at 11, Great St. Andrew Street, Dials, was also removed from Charing Cross Hospital. This man, a house decorator, had been working in different parts of the Metropolis. No. 13, August 13th.—W. Y. W., get. 36 years, vaccinated, residing at 17, High Street, in a room over a retail milk shop. The patient was promptly removed to hospital, where she died. The disease was supposed to have been contracted in Essex, where the deceased had been spending her holidays. As soon as the patients were removed to the Asylum Board's Hospitals, every precaution was taken to prevent the spread of the disease. Upon a notification being received, I visited the house and took measures for isolating the patient, and for the disinfection of the bedding, clothing and rooms. The relatives and friends, who had been exposed to the infection, were urged to be re-vaccinated, but I am sorry to say that with few exceptions the advice was unheeded. I communicated with the several owners of the common lodging-houses in the District, drawing their attention to the outbreak in London, and requested them to report to me the existence of any suspicious case of illness amongst their inmates. The following is a copy of circular letter received from 86 the Local Government Board upon the prevalence, &c., of the disease in the Metropolis. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 2nd August, 1895. Sir,—I am directed by the Local Government Board to bring under the attention of the Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis, the fact that small-pox has recently undergone some considerable increase in London, and that its extension tends to involve a number of Metropolitan Sanitary Districts. The circumstance is the more noteworthy, since at this season of the year small-pox in London is, as a rule, at its lowest ebb. The Board attach very great importance to the most energetic measures being taken in connection with the cases which are occurring, with the view of preventing the spread of infection, and they will be obliged to the Authorities if they will specially instruct their Medical Officer of Health in every case which may be notified to him or which may come to his knowledge, immediately to visit the house where the disease has broken out, and at the earliest possible moment to take such measures as may be necessary to ensure as far as practicable the isolation of the patient, the vaccination of any person who may have been exposed to infection, and the disinfection of the premises, and any further action which the circumstances will admit of, for the purpose of checking the extension of the disease. The Board deem it desirable that the Authority should as regards each case be informed precisely of the measures which have been taken by the Medical Officer of Health, and they will be glad to be furnished with copies of the Reports which are made by him on the subject. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) Hugh Owen, Secretary. In England and Wales the total deaths registered from the disease were 219. In Registration London the mortality was 55 against 206 and 89 in two preceding years. 87 Table xiii (Appendix) is a return respecting vaccination in St. Giles District in 1894, kindly given to me by Mr. Tayton, the Vaccination Officer appointed by the Guardians. 2.—Scarlet Fever (decennial average 62 per 1,000). During 1895 no less than 19,757 cases of scarlet fever were notified to the several Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolis, as against 18,440 in 1894, showing an increase of 7 per cent. ; of these 829 died. In St. Giles District, during the same period, 163 notifications, including 15 duplicates, were received; 113 of these were removed to hospital, where four of the patients died. In the first week of January, the Managers' hospitals contained 1,779 patients; in the week ending 28th December, according to the returns of the Metropolitan Asylum and London Fever Hospitals, there were as many as 2,798 cases under treatment. During the second half of the year the disease prevailed so extensively over the Metropolis, that the Managers of the Asylums' Board found the greatest difficulty in providing beds for the numerous patients who sought admission to their hospitals. In July the Managers addressed a communication to the several Sanitary Authorities suggesting "that in the selection of cases for removal to hospital preference should be given to these patients who, as a consequence of their surroundings and conditions of life, are most in need of hospital treatment." 88 During October and November, a number of scarlet fever patients in several of the Metropolitan Districts could not be removed to hospital in consequence'of the insufficiency of accommodation at the Managers' disposal. The retention of these cases in their homes being considered a danger to the community through causing the spread of the disease, the Vestry of St. Marylebone convened a Conference of representatives from Yestries and District Boards of the Metropolis on 3rd December, at which 28 delegates were present. At the meeting the following resolutions were agreed to:— 1.—That the Asylums Board be urged to take steps to immediately open the vacant beds at the Grore Farm Hospital, Darenth, for the purpose of providing the temporary accommodation required by the Local Authorities for scarlet fever patients. 2.—It was decided to appoint a deputation to wait upon the Local Government Board, and lay before them the recommendation agreed to. The first Resolution was forwarded to the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums District, who at their Meeting held on the 21st December, gave directions for the reopening of the Gore Farm Hospital for the reception of fever patients. 3.—Continued Fevers (decennial average 8.4). The District was free from "simple continued" and "typhus" forms of fever. "Enteric" or "typhoid" caused two deaths, one after removal to hospital, and one at home. This fatality was considerably below the average. In all London the death-rate was 0.02 less than the average fever-rate in the ten years immediately preceding. 89 4.—Diphtheria (decennial average 14.2). The 13 deaths from this disease in 1895 were below the average, 11 of the deaths were children under five years, 10 of the 13 belonged to the parish of St. Griles-inthe-Fields. According to the Registrar-General's Returns the mortality from diphtheria was considerably greater in the east group of sanitary areas than in any other, being 0.81 per 1,000 against 0.42 for the central group. Anti-toxic Serum Treatment of the Disease.—-The following Report of the Medical Superintendents of the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, issued in March last, is interesting. It contains the statistics of the cases of diphtheria treated in 1895, during the whole of which diphtheria anti-toxic serum was used. The results obtained in 1895 were distinctly better than in 1894. The Superintendents state that the improved results as shown by the statistics and by clinical observations were manifested in the following respects:— 1.—A great reduction in the mortality of cases brought under treatment on the first and second day of illness. 2.—The lowering of the combined general mortality to a point below that of any former year. 3.—The still more remarkable reduction in the mortality of the laryngeal cases. 4.—The uniform improvement in the results of tracheotomy at each separate hospital. 5.—The beneficial effect produced on the clinical course of the disease. The cases treated in 1894 before the use of anti-toxin numbered 3,042 and the deaths 902, or 29 6 per cent. The cases treated with anti-toxin in 1895 numbered 2,182, and the deaths 615, or 281 per cent.; but from these figures must be excluded a large proportion of the less severe cases, so that to obtain a fair comparison all the cases for 1895 must be taken, both those treated by anti-toxin (including nearly all the severe cases) and those not treated by anti-toxin (including most of the less severe). We then find that the number of cases was 3,529 with 796 deaths, or 22.5 per cent., as compared with a mortality of 29.6 per cent. in 1894. 90 5.—Measles (decennial average 26.9). The 13 deaths, all young children, were but half the average. This disease is not yet notifiable. On the 9th February, 1892, your Board passed a Resolution in favour of the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to the notification of infectious diseases being extended to measles. This Resolution has been forwarded to the Local Government Board, but up to the present they have not sanctioned the proposal. In reply to a letter from the Clerk to the Vestry of St. George the Martyr, and other Local Authorities, enquiring whether your Board is in favour of measles being a notifiable disease, and whether hospital accommodation should be provided for such patients, replies were forwarded stating that the Board saw no reason to alter the views then entertained of measles being a notifiable disease, but they are not in favour of hospital accommodation being provided for the patients so notified. I consider notification would be most advantageous, as it would be the means of informing Local Authorities where such cases existed. The children from such places could then be prevented from attending school, and their parents advised to call in medical aid, which might save many lives. 6.—Whooping-Cough (decennial average 22.0). 13 young children died from this disease, a number much below the average. The 1,483 from it in all London is the lowest rate on record. 91 DIARRHŒAL ORDER. 7.—Diarrhcea (decennial average 21.3). Caused the death of 30 persons, 27 being infants under 1 year of age. Epidemic Cholera. In the early part of the year a sudden recrudescence of cholera was reported from Constantinople, and from time to time cases were reported from certain districts in Southern Russia, Monte Video, the Argentine Republic, Buenos Ayres, and other foreign cities, but no case of the disease was reported in the United Kingdom. The same precautions were adopted as in previous years by the Port Sanitary Authorities for the careful inspection of all vessels and passengers arriving from infected places, to prevent as far as possible the introduction of the disease into the country. Notification of Infectious Disease. The number of cases of Infectious Disease notified to the several Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the fifty-two weeks ended Saturday, 28th December, 1895, amounted to 43,722; these included small-pox, 1,045; scarlet fever, 19,757; diphtheria, 10,772; enteric fever, 3,710; typhus and continued fevers, 122; puerperal or lying-in fever, 249; erysipelas, 5,994; croup, 451; and summer cholera, 30. Compulsory notification of Infectious Disease is now in force, either by adoption of the Act of 1889 or by the 92 Local Acts, or, in London, under the Act of 1891, in Districts containing an aggregate population of 27,000,000, out of a total population of 29,000,000. There are 202 Urban and 94 Rural Districts in which the Act is not yet in operation. In St. Giles District 839 certificates were received, of which 28 were duplicates, from Medical Practitioners, after the following infectious diseases:— Small-pox 13 and 1 duplicate.

I.—Influenza. At the beginning of the year 1895 another epidemic of influenza prevailed over England, and many parts of the continent. The deaths referred to it in London during the whole year were 2,156 in number, of which not fewer than 1,570 were registered between the middle of February and the end of March. The Metropolitan death-rate rose from 17.4 in January, to the high rate of 41.2 per 1,000 in the week ending March 9 th. The deaths referred to diseases of the respiratory organs during the same period rose from 319 to 1,366, exceeding the corrected average by 842. As in the case of previous epidemics, the disease showed a marked excess amongst persons at 65 years and upwards. The very severe and unprecedented cold period, from January 27th to February 18th, undoubtedly accounted for this excessive mortality. Mr. James Glaisher, F.R.S., in reporting on the meteorology of England during the quarter ending March 31st, 1895, remarks that "the frost, which began 30th December, 1894, continued, with the exception of the week January 14th to 20th, to March 9th, 1895, or for 95 63 days, on every one of which the mean temperature was below its average; the mean amount of deficiency for the 63 days was 60.5. During the continuance of the frost outdoor work was stopped, and all growth was checked, many shrubs and garden plants were killed, gas and water servicepipes and some water-mains were frozen, and the mortality among birds was great; at the end of the quarter vegetation was very backward." The total deaths from influenza during 1895 were 2,156, against 2,336, 2,264, 1,526 and 750 in the four preceding years. In St. Giles District the mortality from it during the past year was 34, against 23, 16, 24, 28, and 6 in the preceding years. In March the following Memorandum was received from the Medical Department of the Local Government Board:— Epidemic Influenza. Influenza became epidemic in England in the winter of 1889-90; it recurred in epidemic form in the spring of 1891, and was maintained up to June of that year; a third epidemic took place in the winter of 1891-92, and after a minor recrudescence in the spring of 1893, a fifth prevalence on a wide scale took place in the winter of 1893-94. England is now passing through a sixth epidemic period. Two detailed reports have been issued by the Board on the subject. The first was by Dr. Parsons, "On the Influenza Epidemic of 1889-90," with an introduction by Sir George Buchanan, M.D., F.R.S., the Board's Medical Officer at that date. The second was a "Further report on Epidemic Influenza, 1889-92," by Dr. Parsons, with papers on the Clinical and Pathological aspects of the disease, by Dr. Klein, F.R.S.,. and an introduction by myself. 96 A "Provisional Memorandum upon Precautions advisable at times when Epidemic Influenza threatens, or is prevalent," was also drawn up by me in January, 1892, and was issued by tbe Board to local Sanitary Authorities. The further study made by the Medical Department as to the natural history of influenza, and as to its clinical and bacteriological characteristics, goes to show that it is a disease against which it is most difficult to apply measures of prevention with any substantial prospect of success. Influenza is highly infective from person to person; its infectious quality is often manifested before the disease is fully recognised; its incubation period is one of the shortest of all infectious diseases; it varies so much in intensity that many cases are never diagnosed at all; one attack confers no marked immunity against another; and the infection is largely eliminated by means of the lungs, the sputa of the sick being invariably charged, during the acute stage] of the disease, with its pathognomonic micro-organism. The disease calls primarily for measures of isolation and of disinfection, but there are difficulties in making any measures universally applicable. Wherever they can be carried out, the following precautions should, however, be adopted:— 1.—The sick should be separated from the healthy. This is especially important in the case of first attacks in a locality or a household. 2.—The sputa of the sick should, especially in the acute stage of the disease, be received into vessels containing disinfectants. Infected articles and rooms should be cleansed and disinfected. 3.—When influenza threatens, unnecessary assemblages of persons should be avoided. 4.—Buildings and rooms in which many people necessarily congregate should be efficiently aerated and cleansed during the intervals of occupation. It should be borne in mind that the liability to contract influenza, and also the danger of an attack, if contracted, are increased by depressing conditions, such as exposure to cold, and to fatigue whether mental or physical. Attention should hence be paid at epidemic 97 periods to all measures tending to the maintenance of health, such as the use of clothing of suitable warmth, and a sufficiency of wholesome food. Persons who are attacked by influenza should at once seek rest, warmth, and medical treatment, and they should bear in mind that the risk of relapse, with dangerous complications, constitutes a chief danger of the disease. R. Thorne Thorne. II.—Constitutional Diseases. This important class of diseases comprises the causes of 199 deaths, including 27 of children under the age of five years. Cancer was accountable for 29 deaths, 10 more than in the preceding year; this disease appears to be on the increase generally. The Tubercular group of this class includes phthisis, scrofula, rickets, tabes, and other forms of tuberculosis. Of these phthisis or consumption was the cause of 124 deaths, 105 of which occurred between the ages of 25 and 65. III.—Local Diseases. The diseases in this class, which comprises eleven orders, caused 442 deaths. The largest number of deaths were in the circulatory and respiratory orders, in the former heart disease was fatal in 52, and in the latter bronchitis, pneumonia, and other diseases of the respiratory system destroyed 214. The extreme cold weather which prevailed during January and February were mainly responsible for the increased mortality in chest diseases over that of the preceding year. h 98 IV.—Sudden and Violent Deaths.

The deaths in St. Grilesin-the-Fields were more than double of those in St. George, Bloomsbury. Of the deaths attributed to accident or negligence, 6 were infants " suffocated in bed with their parents"; 1 death from atrophine was caused by an eye lotion containing the poison being taken in mistake for cough mixture; 6 deaths were caused by vehicles and horses in the streets. The Public Mortuary.—Goldsmith Street. 83 bodies were received, 62 inquests held, and 36 postmortem examinations made. 7 of the bodies were nonparishioners, who had either died suddenly in the District or had been brought in for the convenience of the juries and friends of the deceased. From the opening of the building in 1883 to the end of 1895, 1,006 bodies were received, the majority by order of tlie Coroner. Bye-laws as to Houses Let in Lodgings.

A total of 134 houses dealt with in St. Giles District since the passing of the Act. Fried Fish Shops. In consequence of numerous complaints having been received from various ratepayers complaining of the annoyance caused by the effluvia from the fried fish shops in the District, your Sanitary Committee authorised such means to be taken as might be necessary for abating the nuisance or preventing or counteracting the effluvia. According to these instructions your principal Officers accompanied by the Sanitary Inspectors visited the whole of the fried fish shops in the District on the 21st and 23rd May, viz.:— No. 25, Little Guildford Street. ,, 36, Great Wild Street. „ 1, Drury Lane. ,, 4, Betterton Street. „ 13, High Street. ,, 14, Little St. Andrew Street. ,, 10, Broad Street. 103 After a careful inspection, a number of works were ordered to be carried out, which were considered necessary for their improvement. This order resulted in the closing of the shops Nos. 25, Little Guildford Street, 1, Drury Lane, and 4, Betterton Street. In the other cases the results were the substantial carrying out of the Board's order. Subsequently proceedings were taken by certain inhabitants against the owner of one of these shops, which resulted in the acquittal of the Defendant on all the •counts. Manufacturers or Purveyors of Ice Creams. Your Board adopted the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, who, having considered the communication from the Vestry of St. Mary, Islington, together with copies of the reports of their Medical Officer of Health, and of Dr. Klein, on the subject of the sale of ice creams and the washing of the glasses in which they are served, and recommended that a communication be addressed to the Local Government Board supporting a suggestion of the Vestry of Islington "That legislation should take place for the purpose of providing for the registration of vendors of ice creams and for the regulation of the trade." Recently at a meeting of Medical Officers of Health belonging to the North-Western Division of England and 104 Wales held in Manchester, it was resolved "That in the interest of public health an amendment of the law is urgently required so as to secure (1) a registration with Local Authorities of all persons carrying on the trade by manufacturers or purveyors of ice cream; (2) an inspection of all places where ice cream is manufactured or stored; (3) a regulation of the lighting, ventilation, cleansing, draining, and water-supply of such places; (4) the cleanliness of ice cream stores and shops and all vessels used for the manufacture, storage, or sale of ice cream; (5) precautions to be taken for protecting ice cream against infection or contamination; (6) power of Local Authorities to make regulations for the purposes aforesaid or any of them, subject to such conditions (if any) as the Local Government Board may prescribe." "That the Council of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health be requested to make application to the Local Government Board urging an alteration of the law so as to secure the objects intended by the previous resolution." Recently Clerkenwell, Rotherhithe, and other sanitary authorities have recommended that similar communications be sent to the Local Government Board. Sanitary Work. Table 6, Appendix, contains a summary of the work carried out during the year by Inspectors Bond and Robinson under the provisions of the Public Health 105 (London) Act, 1891, and the Factory and Workshops Acts, 1878 to 1891. Inspections and Orders. A. total of 11,261 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors, and 1,256 orders were served upon owners for the abatement of nuisances of various kinds, and the sanitary amendment of houses and premises. Proceedings before Magistrates. In a majority of the cases the works necessary for the abatement of the nuisances were carried out by the owners without the issue of a summons. But in 34 instances where the parties failed to carry out the orders they were summoned to the Police Court, where convictions were obtained in every instance. One special case is worth recording, where a builder was summoned, convicted and fined for having constructed a drain in such a manner as to be a nuisance or injurious to health, contrary to the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Underground Rooms. 13 underground rooms or kitchens found to be illegally occupied as dwellings and sleeping places were either closed or altered so as to comply with the Act. Overcrowding. In 32 cases where the Inspectors found rooms so overcrowded as to be injurious or dangerous to health, orders 106 were immediately served upon the owners to reduce the number of persons living in such rooms. Animals kept so as to be a Nuisance. A number of pigeons, fowls, dogs, cats, and a horse, were removed from premises where they were found to be kept in such place or manner as to be a nuisance or injurious to health. Unsound Food. Several parcels of diseased, unsound, and unwholesome fish, fruit and vegetables intended for the food of man were brought to the Stone Yard and destroyed. Factories, Workshops and Workplaces. 113 visits were made to factories and workshops, and where necessary cleansing and sanitary orders were made upon the owners for ensuring the safe-guarding the health of the workers. Slaughter-Houses. At the meeting of the Public Health and Housing Committee of the London County Council, held on 21st October, licenses were renewed for the two following Slaughter-houses:— Situation. Licensee. No. 6, Drury Lane Mr. C. Shortlands. No. 23, Store Street Mr. Wm. Kingsmill. Previous to the licensing day, your Sanitary Committee, after careful inspection of the premises, resolved 107 that "the Clerk to the Board be requested to address a communication to the London County Council, informing them, that while there appears to be nothing in the actual condition of the premises which requires amendment, the Committee are of the same opinion as when they viewed the premises last year, viz., that the Council should refuse to renew the licenses for Slaughter-houses, as the Committee are of opinion that Slaughter-Houses should not exist in crowded districts of the Metropolis. Cow-House. At the same meeting the license was renewed for the undermentioned Cow-shed:— Situation. Licensee. Dimensions of Shed. No. of Cows Allowed. No of Cows. No. 4, Goldsmith Street Mr. Edward Jones 7,246 cubic feet. 9 3 The collection and removal of the manure and otherrefuse from this Cow-house is now carried out by your Board under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Bakehouses. 54 & 55 Yict. cap. 76, sect. 94, sub-sect. 1; and 58 & 59 Yict. cap. 37. The following list shows that there are 27 bakehouses in the district; 14 in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and 13 in St. George, Bloomsbury. 21 of these are underground. 108 The whole were regularly inspected during the year, and where necessary orders were served upon the owners for their sanitary improvement.

Disinfectants. By order of your Board the disinfectants used for the following purposes are:— 1. Chloride of Lime, for disinfecting the soil and refuse matter removed from the catch-pit gullies and sewers and house drains. 2. Carbolic Acid, for disinfecting urinals. 3. Carbolic Acid Powder, for deodorising dust-bins. 4. Sanitas Powder and Fluid, for use in the mortuary and post-mortem room. 5. Permanganate of Potash, in street-watering and flushing of courts and alleys. 6. Perchloride of Mercury, for the disinfection of drains, sewers, and gully-pits. A mixture of this is made in the proportions of— Perchloride of Mercury 8 ounces (3,500 grains). Methylated spirit 2 pints. Aniline (green) half an ounce. Water to make 50 gallons. 110 7. Tuson's Disinfectant, for the underground conveniences. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S. R.
