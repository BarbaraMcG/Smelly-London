Borough of Malden and Coombe Annual Report OF THE Medical Officer of Health AND THE Chief Public Health Inspector FOR THE YEAR 1964 (1) BOROUGH OF MALDEN AND COOMBE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1964 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Malden. 1965. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the former Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1964, the last report for the Borough in its present form, and my last as Medical Officer of Health. I regret that it is not possible to comment in the customary detail in the various sections of the text, time will permit only general observations and, at the time of writing, the full statistics are not yet available from the Registrar General. So far as infectious diseases are concerned there is a gratifying fall in the numbers of cases of sonne dysentery. On the other hand the troublesome, if not serious, epidemic vomiting has continued its prevalence, a number of schools having been affected. The department has co-operated with the Public Health Laboratory in investigating possible causes of this illness. Until the infecting organism is identified and its method of spread through the community traced, there is little beyond attention to general hygiene which can be done to prevent its occurrence. The maintenance of health and prevention of disease depends upon the co-operation and good 3ense of all members of the community. Shopkeepers, delivery men, factories, schools and colleges all have a part to play. From these and from general practitioners, district nurses, hospitals and clinics I have had the utmost co-operation and help during my work in Maiden and Commbe (2) From members of the Council and. the staff of the Health and other departments and of the County Council I have had unfailing support. The general public who, in the ultimate carry responsibility for their own well being in their own hands, and the voluntary Associations whose devoted service is so effective in this Borough, have always responded to requests for help. To all these it is my pleasure to express ny gratitude and the hope that they will continue to support their New Borough in the same way as the old. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Courcillors, Your obedient servant, P. WESTCOMBE. Medical Officer of Health. (3) PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OP INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Acute Poliomyelitis For the third year in succession no case of poliomyelitis was notified in the Borough. Diphtheria The following statistics refer to immunisation carried out during the year: Number of children immunised during the year (pre- school 534, school 6) 540 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 1,258 For the 17th year in succession the district was completely free from this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. Whooping Cough The number of cases of whooping cough notified was 18. No deaths occurred. Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and mothers appreciate the facilities for immunisation which are available. 529 children were immunised during the year and 441 received a reinforcing dose. Tetanus Inoculation against tetanus has been available since 1956 and is now widely accepted. Although not a common disease, the mortality rate is high and immunisation is recommended. 650 children were immunised during the year and 695 received a reinforcing dose. No cases were notified. Smallpox Details of the number of vaccinations carried out during the year are as follows: (4) Number of primary vaccinations 314 (106) Number of revaccinations 21 (27) (Previous year's figures in parentheses). Of the above, 151 persons were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners and 48 of those vaccinated were under 1 year of age. Scarlet Fever The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was 8, giving an incidence rate of 0.17 per thousand population. Measles 77 cases of Measles were notified during the year. There were no deaths recorded from this disease. Intestinal Infections One case of paratyphoid fever was notified during the year. Four cases of sonne dysentery were notified and investigated by the department. No case of food poisoning was returned during the year. Non-notifiable Diseases Head teachers of Local Education Authority schools notify cases of non-notifiable disease occurring in their schools. This is a useful procedure which is much appreciated. Mumps and Chicken pox were the two most prevalent during the year.

(15) ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR 1964 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Maiden. 1965 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the former Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my annual report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year 1964. It is regretted that this is the last report to be published in this form for the Borough of Maiden and Coombe as the Borough has amalgamated with the Boroughs of Kingston-upon-Thames and Surbiton to form the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames. Unlike the preceding years there were no staff changes in the year under review and, as a consequence, the work of the Department was able to proceed with concentration upon the work in connection with clean food, housing and clean air. As will be seen from the report, progress continued to be made in connection with the introduction of smoke control areas and slow but steady progress was made in connection with the improvement of houses. A survey of unfit houses was carried out, When approximately 50 houses were found to be such that they should be regarded as potentially unfit and would require to be dealt with during the next five years. The Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963, required that all premises coming within the purview of the Act, should be registered. In practice, many occupiers of premises did not comply with this requirement and much work has been necessary to obtain the details. (16) Comment was made in last year's Annual Report on the outbreak of typhoid in Aberdeen. Since that time, a report on this outbreak has been published. The findings serve to emphasise the need for constant vigilance in connection with the handling of food and the necessity of providing sufficient information and adequate education for all food-handlers. As this is the last report I wash particularly to express my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee and to all members of the Council for their understanding and support during the time I have been privileged to serve as both Deputy and Chief Public Health Inspector. I am greatly indebted to the other Chief Officers and their staffs for their co-operation and I am especially grateful to the staff of this department for their support and enthusiasm and to Dr. P. Westcombe for his sympathetic consideration at all times. It is appropriate to end this report by expressing my intention to continue to foster the good relations -which have always existed between the residents of the Borough and the staff of the department in the new Council. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, P. KENTON. Chief Public Health Inspector. (17) HOUSING The general standard of housing in the Borough is good. Number of houses built during the year- (a) by the Council 30 (b) by private enterprise 121 Number of houses in course of construction- (a.) by the Council 36 (b) by private enterprise 181 For the purpose of abating nuisances or executing repairs to houses the following notices were served - Preliminary 26 Abatement 28 These figures do not include verbal notices often given with regard to minor matters. REGISTERED COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no registered common lodging houses in the district. HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION In this district there are few houses to which the Housing Act, 1961 refers and. by co-operation with the owner one house was brought up to the required standard. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, as amended by the Housing Act, 1961. provides for local authorities to make grants to owners for improvement of their property. During the year this legislation was further amended and extender by the Housing Act, 1964. There are two types of grant available, the 'Standard' and the Discretionary'. (18) The 'Standard Grant' is available for the cost of installing a bath, water closet in or readily accessible from within the building, hot water system, wash hand basin and satisfactory facilities for storing food. The local authority must approve a grant provided the dwelling is likely to remain fit for human habitation for not less than 15 years and the applicant has a freehold interest or a leasehold interest of which not less than 15 years remain, unexpired. The maximum amount of 'Standard Grant' which is 50 % of the cost of carrying out the work, shall not exceed £155 if all the following facilities are provided. The maximum amount of grant payable for each facility is as follows; A fixed bath or shower £25 A wash hand basin £5 A hot and cold water supply at a fixed bath or shower £35 A hot and cold water supply at a wash hand basin £15 A hot and cold water supply at a sink £25 A water closet £40 A satisfactory food store £10 On completion, the dwelling must possess all the above amenities. The Housing Act, 1964 allows for an increase in the maximum amount of Standard Grant to £350 instead of the normal £155, where, in order to provide the facilities, it is necessary to undertake more extensive works of construction, drainage or water supply. The Council has continued to give 'Discretionary Grants' for works of improvement or conversion up to a cost of £800 and subject to a grant up to 50 % of this cost. Generally speaking Discretionary Grants are given where extensive work is necessary to provide modern amenities, for example, the construction of a bathroom extension to an existing house. An important change introduced by the Housing Act, 19&4, is the reduction from 10 years to 3 years in the period of time during which the conditions of grant apply. During the year numerous enquiries were made by ratepayers and advice was given. Although many did not avail themselves of the grant offered, a considerable amount of work has been carried out. The following tables show the number of grants approved and payments made during the year: (19) Standard. Grants. APPLICATIONS Received (No. of dwellings) Approved (No. of dwellings) Total Grant approved 14 14 £1,320 GRANTS PAID DURING THE YEAR No. of dwellings Total Amount Number of amenities provided Fixed baths or showers Wash basins Hot water supplies Water closets Pood storage facilities 13 £1,019 6 8 9 10 5 Discretionary Grants.

The Housing Act, 1964, imposes a duty on the Local Authority to inspect its district and may declare defined areas as Improvement Areas. Owners of properties in these areas may be required to improve their houses by providing the facilities qualifying them for Standard grant.

(28) ICE CREAM 64 samples were submitted to the methylene blue test. The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does serve as a simple and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in nanufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certifiete giving the results of testing has the following note appended: "Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of icecream it is unwise topay too much attention to the bacteriological results of any single sample. Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade I, 80 per cent into grades I or II, not more than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV". 1 The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947: Year Samples Taken Grades I or II % Grade III % Grade IV % 1947 29 13 44.8 13 44.8 3 10.4 1948 84 55 65.4 22 26.2 7 8.4 1949 63 54 85.7 8 12.7 1 1.6 1950 85 81 95.3 4 4.7 0 - 1951 79 74 93.7 5 6.3 0 - 1952 76 71 93.4 5 6.6 0 - 1953 46 43 93.5 1 2.2 2 4.3 1954 51 39 76.5 9 17.6 3 5.9 1955 40 37 92.5 2 5.0 1 2.5 1956 52 48 92.3 4 7.7 0 - 1957 54 54 100.0 0 - 0 - 1958 56 56 100.0 0 - 0 - 1959 38 38 100.0 0 - 0 — 1960 46 46 100.0 0 — 0 - 1961 58 57 98.3 1 1.7 0 - 1962 50 50 100.0 0 - 0 - 1963 54 53 98.1 0 - 1 1.9 1964 64 63 98.4 1 1.6 0 — (29) CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 1961 This Act, which perpetuates regulations made made the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, requires that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are prescribed.

REFUSE TIP AND REFUSSE DISPOSAL Refuse from the area is collected under the direction of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor and transported to a loading bay used jointly by this Council, the Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames and. the Borough of Surbiton. From the loading bay the refuse is conveyed by contractors to disused gravel pits at Egham. PEST CONTROL The obligations of the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, have been fully met. The work of rats and mice destruction continues on a well organised basis, the free service to householders being maintained with appropriate charges made in the case of business premises, many of which are on annual service agreements. The Borough river boundaries, depots, disused refuse tips and open spaces have received constant attention, also the premises of the North Surrey Joint Sewage Board. (31) A 10% test baiting of the Borough sewers was undertaken and. no infestation were found. Liaison has been maintained with the officers of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood and No. 10 Workable Area Committee held its annual meeting at which the problems of insect control were discussed. PIGEONS Under licence from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood, a reduction of the pigeon population has been achieved but much remains to be done to control these pests and success will only be achieved with full co-operation from the public by their refraining from feeding and harbouring these birds. INSECT PESTS As in previous years, the department was able to give advice and help to the public who suffered inconvenience from insect pests ircluding wasps, bees, hornets, steam flies, cockroaches, beetles and ants. 12 rooms were treated for infestations of bugs, 1 rocm for fleas and 15 rooms for flies. 96 council houses were inspected for evidence of vermin. A survey of houses for evidence of dry rot and timber infestation was continued during the year to ascertain the extent of nuisance from these sources. CARAVANS There are no caravan sites in the Borough and no licences were granted to station moveable dwellings in the area. Two Orders were made under the terms of the Surrey County Council Act to prevent the stationing of caravans on vacant land. RIVERS AND STREAMS The river Hogsmill and the Beverley Brook, which flow into the river Thames, provide much of the western and eastern boundaries of the district. (52) WATER SURELY The whole of the area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. and the supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. In view of the large number of routine bacteriological, and chemical examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any routine tests. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE With the exception of a small quantity which is discharged to the sewage disposal works of the Borough of Sutton and Cheam at Worcester Park and to the Wandle Valley Joint Sewage Board, the sewage of the district is treated at the modern works of the North Surrey Joint Sewage Board, situated within the Borough. CLEAN AIR Smoke Control Areas . Good progress was made during the year in establishing smoke control areas and on the 1st October , 1964 the No.4 Smoke Control Area came into operation. The survey of No.5 Smoke Control Area was completed and the Order confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, The Order which covers the area between the Motspur Park and Worcester Park railway lines to the west and the Borough boundary to the east, comes into operation on the 1st October, 1965. During the year 4,700 visits were made in connection with the introduction of smoke control areas and the Mobile Exhibition of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation visited the Borough.

NOISE ABATEMENT No formal action was necessary under the provisions of the Noise Abatement Act, 1960, but a number of complaints were dealt with informally. The Act provides that a complaint of the existence of a nuisance may be made by three or more persons each of whom is the occupier of land or premises and in that capacity is aggrieved by the nuisance. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration from aircraft and in proceedings it is a defence to prove that the best practicable means have been adopted for preventing the nuisance.
