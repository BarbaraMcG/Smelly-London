The Medical Officer of Health Reforts as follows:— During the year ending on the last day of 1864, the registered deaths in Shoreditch amounted to 3710. This year includes the mortality for 53 weeks, a circumstance which accounts to some extent for the apparent increase. Assuming the population to have increased at the rate observed during the ten years 1851-1861, namely: 1.7 per cent. annually, we have a gross population for 1864 of 135433. This is an increase of 2264 upon the year 1863. The excess of births over deaths as registered, which always falls short of the actual excess, inasmuch, as all the births are not registered, is 1490. A portion of the increase of population is therefore apparent only, or must be accounted for by an excess of immigration over emigration. In order to estimate the rate of mortality during 1864, we are, considering the experience of former years, justified in taking the population at 135433. The deaths are 3710 for 53 weeks, or 3620 for 52 weeks. As 52 weeks give 364 days, only one day short of an entire year, it will be more nearly correct to take the latter number as representing the mortality. This gives one death for every 37½ persons living; or 2.67 per centum. Comparing this with the metropolis at large, we find in all London 77723 deaths took place during the same 364 days, in a population of 2,948,963, which gives a death-rate of 2.645 per centum, a rate with which that of Shoreditch is nearly identical. On further comparing the death-rate of Shoreditch with that of the Eastern Districts of London of which it forms part, we find in these districts a general death-rate of 2.89 per cent, shewing that Shoreditch maintained a rather more favourable position in the health-scale than the mean of its associated parishes. A deduction must further be made for St. Lukes' 14 Workhouse, in which institution occurred 245 deaths, included in the gross Shoreditch mortality. 28 persons more died in Hoxton Lunatic Asylum. The rate of mortality during 1864 was slightly in access of the average of the ten preceeding years throughout London and also throughout the Eastern Districts. It is perhaps more useful to exhibit the course of the death-rate in Shoreditch alone during the last 11 years. I have calculated the following rates upon the estimated population for each year, obtained by multiplying the population of each year successively, by 1.017, the annual rate of increase actually ascertained to have ruled in Shoreditch between the censuses of 1851 and 1861. Table shewing the Death-rate in London and Shoreditch, year by year, from 1854 to 1864. 1854 1855 1856 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 London 2.94 2.43 2.21 2.24 2.39 2.27 2.25 2.32 2.36 2.45 2.65 Shoreditch 2.73 2.56 2.30 2.40 2.53 2.30 2.30 2.50 2.54 2.50 2.67 It must be observed that the rates as estimated above, include the deaths in St. Lukes' Workhouse; If these were deducted, the deathrate of Shoreditch would, of course, compare more favourably with that of the metropolis. Shoreditch stands in point of population to all London as 1 to 22, The twenty-second part of the London deaths is 3533, whereas the actual loss including the 245 deaths in St. Lukes', was 3620. Table I. exhibits the causes of deaths under several ages throughout the year. In the order of destructiveness, we find: 1.—That Phthisis ranks first, 450 deaths are assigned to this cause. 2.—In the second place stands Bronchitis, which carried off 407 persons. 3.—Then Pneumonia, another form of lung inflammation commonly more acute in nature than Bronchitis, and attacking children in larger proportions, which killed 303 persons, of whom 247 were children under 5 years of age. 4.—Scarlatina occupies the fourth place, destroying 236 persons of whom 223 were children under 10 years. 5.—Brain diseases, including the 28 deaths in Hoxton Asylum were the cause of death in 15 222 cases; to these might be added G8 deaths, which it was possible to separate from the general description under the designation of Apoplexy. 6.—Another order of deaths which might appear to belong to Brain diseases is Convulsions; under this separate head are classed 151 deaths, no less than 146 of these being of children under the age of 5. But Convulsions are so frequently dependent upon Scrofula, that probably the great majority of these 146 cases ought to be referred to the next head. 7.—Scrofula, Tabes Mesenterica, and Hydrocuphabus, under these names, all being varieties of manifestation of one constitutional disorder, 187 deaths are classed. 8.—157 deaths are attributed to measles. 9.—153 deaths are attributed to Old Age; of these, 27 occurred in St. Lukes' Workhouse. 10.—Fever, under Avliich generic name are embraced Typhoid and Typhus, and certainly, also some cases which in strict medical sense have no title to be called Fever—is assigned as the cause of 140 deaths, of which 38 occured in St. Lukes' Workhouse. 11.—Under the vague names of Atrophy and Debility are ranged 132 deaths, 102 of them being under the age of 1 year, with these might be associated 57 deaths of children prematurely born, and 6 deaths of infants born with such malformations as were incompatible with life. These 57 deaths from premature birth are far from representing the total number of infants that perish either from primary defect of organization, of congenital disease, or from difficulties attending birth. From these and other causes, many children are born dead. They are not registered. Thus an important element for sanitary or hygienic study is in great measure withdrawn from observation. Vital statistics can never be complete or admit of satisfactory comparison between different countries, until the still-born children are registered. From my own inquiries, based upon large data, I conclude that the stillbirths are not less than 3 per cent.; that is, of all births at maturity or approaching maturity, and taking no account of abortions or miscarriages. 12.—Diarriœa was the cause of death in 132 cases, of which 120 were of infants under 5 years. 13.—125 deaths were due to Whoopingcough, another disease almost exclusively fatal to young children. 14.—Diseases of the Heart caused 121 deaths. 15.—Various forms of Lung diseases, mostly Chronic and affecting persons past middle 16 age, carried off 99 persons. 16.—Various diseases of the abdominal organs, as Stomach, Liver, Kidney Diseases, Dropsy, carried off 170 persons, the greater number of whom had passed 30 years of age. 17.—Laryngitis, a term including Croup and various cases of inflammation of the air-passages, destroyed 75 lives, of which 66 were those of children under 5. 18.—Cancer in various forms killed 52 persons. 19.—79 deaths, all being the subjects of Coroner's inquests were assigned to various kinds of Violence, to Poison, and Drowning. 20.—24 deaths were classed under Erysipelas. 21.—To Diphtheria 17. 22.—To Small Pox 8. 23.—16 deaths were registered without any specified cause. 24.—12 women died of childbed fever and 13 other women died in childbed. Upon the deaths in childbed, I think it useful, in view of frequently revived attempts to establish lying-in hospitals and foundlings in this town, to offer an observation. The foundation of similar institutions is of course advocated on the plea, that they are necessary to promote the safety of lying-in women and their infants. It is continually urged, that, whereas in most Roman Catholic and some heathen Countries, lying-in hospitals and foundlings exist, Protestant England boasting of its Charity and tender respect for human life has few or none. It is especially contended that similar institutions afford a substantial guarantee against the crime of infanticide. The establishment of lying-in hospitals is a great sanitary question. The establishment of foundlings is a great social and moral question, as well as a sanitary one. Postponing the consideration of the social and moral aspect although this is almost always inseparably associated with the sanitary aspect, and looking at the matter solely as to its bearing upon the saving of life, I think it will not be possible to shew in any foreign community which maintains a lying-in hospital, a child-bed mortality so low as 25 in 3710, or 1 in 148. And even this, the apparent Shoreditch mortality is certainly far greater than the real, because only live-births, and not all these, are registered. Now the lying-in hospital mortality abroad, is at least 5 per cent., so that on 3710 births, the hospital system would lose not 25, but 185 women. And when women die in childbirth, their children's chance of life is sorely deteriorated. The cause of this great mortality in lying-in hospitals is the almost 17 inevitable creation of puerperal fever wheresoever two or more women in childbed are placed in the same room. It is not therefore in the interest of women that lying-in hospitals are advocated. Then as to the children and the prevention of infanticide. It must be freely admitted that child-murder is a frequent crime in this country. Any rational scheme designed to lessen the commission of a crime so unnatural deserves to be well weighed. But before concluding that lying-in hospitals and foundlings, will effect this object, it is prudent to inquire whether infant life be really more secure where these institutions abound. In the first place, I have it on the highest statistical authority, that of Dr. Farr, that there exists no proof whatever that direct infanticide is more common in England than on the continent. In the next place, I will invite attention to another fact: there seems to be a close and complementary connexion between the lying-in hospital and the foundling: that is, in a community whose moral and social customs demand the lying-in hospital, the foundling must follow. In such a community, the bonds of home and maternity are much weaker than they are here. Pregnant women leave their homes, resort to hospitals to be delivered, and coming out, leave their children at the foundling, returning themselves to their former mode of life disencumbered, and abandoning to others the care of their offspring. What becomes of this offspring? every possible care, perhaps short of that which a mother can bestow, is lavished upon these outcasts. But the result is a very large sacrifice of infant life. The mortality in foundlings is far above the rate of infant mortality here. If a balance be struck between the saving of infants under the hospital and foundling system, and that prevalent in England, it will be found to be largely in favour of this country. The population in France, for example, instead of exhibiting that increase which surely attends sound sanitary administration, and which is required to sustain the prosperity of nations, is actually falling off. So marked is this downward course, that it has attracted anxious consideration. No doubt there are several causes operating to produce it; but certainly, lying-in hospitals and foundlings, and the associated customs and moral characteristics of the people are largely concerned. It is not perhaps just to compare the criminality of the mother, who simply abandons her child at the foundling, with a 18 great probability of its dying, with that of the wretched woman, who, in the agony of shame and destitution, destroys her child outright. But in the endeavour to lessen the inducement to occasional and exceptional direct infanticide, it is well to reflect whether we may not be drawn into establishing an order of things that will entail an entire revolution in the moral tone and domestic customs of our countrymen, and raise indirect infanticide on a large scale into an organised and systematic institution. On the Epidemics of 1864.— Table III. shews the fluctuations observed in the prevalence of the principal Epidemic or Zymotic diseases during the ten years ending with 1864. Small-Pox exhibits the greatest range of variation. This circumstance is dependent upon the infectious character and the almost absolute preventibility of the disease, by protecting the human system against the consequences of infection. From time to time small-pox breaks out and spreads; then subsides, so that few or no cases are observed. This is due to the fact, that after a lull, whether from neglect of vaccination, from imperfect vaccination, or from the protective influence of vaccination being exhausted in some persons, an accumulation of subjects susceptible to the poison has arisen. Upon these small-pox seizes and spreads amongst them. When under the combined influence of vaccination and re-vaccination, and the action of varioloid poison itself, the susceptible subjects are no longer susceptible, the disease fades away. Thus we see the deaths from small-pox rose from 7 in 1862 to 113 in 1863, and fell again to 8 in 1864. But the deaths in the register, of course, give but an imperfect idea of the extent to which the disease may have prevailed. From returns furnished by Mr. Nightingale, Clerk to the Board of Guardians, we find that 10 cases have been sent to the small-pox hospital at Highgate. The returns of the medical officers under the Poor Law, shew, that 49 cases came under their care 19 The following are the Vaccination Returns for the year 1864. Births. Vaccinations Proportion of Vaccination to Births. Holywell 549 227 .41 St. Leonards 657 385 .60 Hoxton Now Town 1058 336 .32 Hoxtcon Old Town 1027 298 .29 Haggerstone West 982 269 .29 Haggerstone East 805 365 .45 Totals 5078 1880 .35 Two tilings strike the eye in this table: first, the great variation in the proportion of vaccinations to births in the different districts; and secondly, the very low proportion borne by the aggregate vaccinations to the total births. It is, however, impossible to tell how much significance must be attached to these figures. Only the vaccinations performed by the Poor-Law Surgeons are registered. We cannot know how many more vaccinations are performed in private practice; still, there is, no doubt, every year a residue of unvaccinated children. It is remarkable that in 1856 the registered vaccinations were in the proportion of 69 per cent. of the registered births. The fall from this to 35 per cent. is great. It may be accounted for greatly, I believe, by the fact, that private vaccinations now bear a larger proportion to public, and that a certain proportion of private vaccinations were formerly registered. Considerable fluctuations are also observed in Measles. In the ten years the deaths from this cause have ranged from 39 to 199. The highest number was in 1862. Scarlatina has risen from 71 in 1861 to 244 in 1863, and shews a slight decline to 236 in 1864. This disease, arises I believe, not uncommonly in bad sanitary conditions, but spreads by infection. The spread by infection it is almost impossible to prevent. The sanitary officers cannot deal with the clothes and the linen of infected persons in the manner that is most effectual. There is more hope 20 in the advance of general hygienic measures, which will gradually diminish the sources of origin of the disease. Scarlatina has proved fatal in a higher proportion in Shoreditch than in London generally. Diarrhoea has not been unusually prevalent. This summer disease, it is well-known, affects persons of all ages, but it is not often fatal except to infants. Two great causes produce it,—First, defective local sanitary conditions; secondly, atmospheric influences, checking and disturbing the the functions of the excreting organs; to these might be added errors of diet, such as eating unwholesome food and fruit. Diarrhoea has been rather less fatal in Shoreditcli than in all London. Pneumonia I have classed as an epidemic, because I have observed that in a great many instances it is caused by living in crowded unwholesome dwellings, and exposure to other sources of aerial poisons; still it is so closely dependent upon cold, that we observe less fluctuation in the annual deaths, than in any other epidemic. It is more fatal in severe winters. Hence, last year, the deaths exceeded those of any preceeding year. Fever.—The attention of the student of sanitary laws has always been drawn with especial interest to Fever. In former reports, I have dwelt with considerable detail, upon the sanitary bearings of the diseases classed together under this title. Included in the Shoreditch register are the fever deaths in St. Lukes' Workhouse; in this institution, are received a large number of cases of Typhus from the Refuge. These are therefore indicated in a separate column. The proper fever deaths in Shoreditch exhibit a diminishing ratio since 1862. Typhus has been unusually prevalent in London during the last three years. It is a disease that bears a closer relation to that form of poison which arises Iron overcrowding and destitution, than to those which depend upon bad drainage. Typhoid, fever which is undoubtedly more intimately connected with the sewage-poison, has been steadily diminishing in frequency. The Poor Law Medical Officers return 854 cases of Fever; but these include necessarily many cases of very different type, and even many which it would be impossible to range under the specific heads of Typhus or Typhoid. 123 cases of Fever, most of them included in the just-cited returns of the Poor Law Medical Officers, were sent to the Fever hospital at Islington. Making allowance for these cases and other causes of disturbance, the 21 gratifying fact results, that Fever has been far less prevalent and less fatal in Shoreditch than in the metropolis at large. In Table II. are exhibited the number of deaths from the several causes occurring during each of the four quarters of 1864, and the first quarter of 1865. Deaths and Births in the different districts of Shoreditch. The proportions of these are set forth in Table V. The average proportion borne by deaths to births is .73. It ranges from a minimum of .59 in Haggerstone East to a maximum of .85 in Hoxton New Town. Of course, the proportion is raised in Haggerstone West and Hoxton New Town by the deaths in the Workhouses. Ages at Death.—Of 3710 deaths, 837 or 22 per cent. occurred under the age of 1 year, and 901 more or 24 per cent. under 5 years. Thus, 1738, or 46 per cent. deaths occurred under 5 years; this proportion is less than in 1863, when the deaths under 5 were 48 per cent. In 1862 the proportion was also 48. In 1861 it was 49 per cent. The health indication then, derived from a lessening infantile mortality, is favourable. The number of deaths from 5 to 10 years was 160 or .042; between 10 and 20 it was 125 or .033; between 20 and 40 it was 424 or 11 per cent.; between 40 and 60 it was 539 or 14 per cent., and above 60, it was 724 or 20 per cent. The proportion above 60 is not unfavourable. Coroners Inquests. 199 inquests were registered. In 117 cases, the immediate cause assigned was some ordinary disease; but in several of these, the exciting cause of the fatal disease was intemperance. There were 25 cases of children suffocated in bed, and 7 other cases of children found dead, no cause being discovered. In 25 cases, death occurred through accidental violence. There were 21 cases of presumed suicidal death; of these, 1 was the result of "Poison," 8 of "Drowning," and 12 of other forms of violence, chiefly "Hanging." There were 4 cases of deaths from violence, the result of murder or manslaughter. Sanitary Improvements. Year after year has been marked by substantial improvements. Comparatively few of the worst order of close courts and alleys which offered the most favourable nurseries for disease, now remain. The condition of the greater number of the most defective 22 dwellings has been materially amended. Many acres of ground thickly covered with houses have been provided with effective drainage and sewerage. In my last year's report, it was stated that the number of houses demolished for the purpose of the railways amounted to 547. Down to the present time the number is 643; so that nearly 100 more houses have disappeared. The greater part of these are of a description to occasion no regret for their loss. Amongst the most satisfactory demolitions is that of Red Lion Court. Many houses also in Long Alley have been taken down, and those remaining, will be materially improved by the opening up of better access to light and air. In addition to the railway demolitions, I record with much satisfaction the clearing away of the whole nest of small tenements behind the Fuller's Almshouses. These places were so badly situated and so defectively constructed as to defy efficient sanitary improvement. It is also gratifying to see the removal of Fuller's Alms-houses themselves.—They were not fit for their purpose. The aged objects of the Charity, will in future enjoy a residence in every way more suitable to their wants and more in accordance with the benevolent intentions of the founder. The new Vestry Hall will take the place of these Almshouses and of the courts in the rear referred to. The inspector's report and the report of the Sanitary Committee, which has continued its labours with excellent effect, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Sarson, contain an enumeration of the sanitary works carried out. In my last report, I referred to the defect of power available for the abatement of the most serious cause of the propagation of infectious diseases, arising out of the practice of retaining the bodies of persons who have died of such diseases in inhabited houses. The subject seemed to me so important, that I drew up a paper on the subject for discussion, by the association of Metropolitan Officers of health. The necessity for the following provisions was universally recognized :— 1st.—The establishment of public mortuaries for the reception of the dead bodies pending arrangements for interment. 23 2.—Power vested in the Medical Officer of Health, to order the removal from inhabited houses of the bodies of persons who have succumbed to certain infectious diseases. 3.—Power to enforce the disinfection of the bodies of persons who have succumbed to certain infectious diseases, by the application of charcoal or other means pending interment. It would also be very desirable, for local authorities to provide means for the purification by heat, &c., of infected bed-linen and clothes. The Gas. As chemical Examiner—the Medical Officer of Health reports:—from April 1864 to April 1865, 43 separate testings were made of the illuminating power of the Independent Company's Gas. The observations were made under the conditions of the Act of Parliament. The minimum illuminating power was 12.1 candles, the maximum 15.7 candles, the average 13.6. The requisite power being 12 candles. More frequent observations were made as to the purity of the Gas. On the 20th December, 1864, and previously to that date, the gas was free from Sulphuretted Hydrogen. On the 27th December, I detected this impurity in large quantity. It continued until the 31st; and for some days later, traces of sulphuretted hydrogen could be detected in burners at a distance from the works. Ammonia has hardly ever been absent, and it is almost always found in large proportion. The pressure has been generally 2 inches or a little more after dark. The contamination with sulphuretted hydrogen occuring in December, led the Vestry to memorialise the Home Secretary, requesting him to exercise the power vested in him, under the gas act, 23rd and 24th Vict. Chap. 125, (1860,) to appoint an Inspector to examine the Works of the Company. The Home Secretary appointed Dr. Letheby, who attended by myself, and the Engineer to the Company examined the works of the Independent Company on the 19th of January, 1865. I append his report, made to Sir George Grey. Since the date of that report no sulphuretted hydrogen has been detected, but there has been little or no improvement in respect to the contamination with Ammonia. There are gas-works in the country where this impurity is completely taken out. It must be considered as evidence that the best appliances for purifying gas are not yet in operation at the Independent works. 24 DR. LETHEBY'S REPORT. METROPOLIS GAS ACT, 1860. To the Right Honorable Sir George Grey, Bart., Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department. Sir, In pursuance of your warrant of the 16th inst., authorizing and directing me to enquire into and concerning the grounds of a complaint made to you on the 3rd day of January, 1865, by Memorial in writing from the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, in the County of Middlesex, signed by their Clerk, respecting the quality of the gas supplied to the Parish by the Independent Gas Light and Coke Company, I have the honor to report to you that on the 19th inst., after having given due notice to the Company in accordance with the provisions of the " 8th section of the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860," I visited the Gas Works of the Company and made careful inquiries into and concerning the grounds of the said complaint. I was accompanied during my inspection of the works by the Engineer of the Works who afforded me every facility for such inspection, and I was also accompanied by the Gas Examiner for the Parish, who informed me that on the 27th, 28th and 29th days of December, 1864, he found that when the gas was tested in accordance with the instructions of the 25th section of the before-mentioned Act of Parliament, it was largely contaminated with Ammonia and Sulphuretted Hydrogen. Accordingly at the time of my inspection and enquiries at the works, I examined the gas for these impurities by exposing Turmeric paper, and paper imbued with acetate of lead, to a current of the gas issuing for one minute under a pressure of 5 tenths of an inch of water; and I ascertained that the gas contained a minute trace of Sulphuretted Hydrogen, and was highly charged with Ammonia. These experiments were repeated with the same results at the place provided by the Company, in accordance with the directions of the 27th section of the before-mentioned Act of Parliament. 25 It was manifest therefore that at the time of my inspection and inquiries on the 19th inst., one of the grounds of complaint as to the quality of the gas was still in existence, for the gas was largely contaminated with Ammonia; and with respect to the other ground of complaint, namely, the presence of Sulphurretted Hydrogen in the gas, I was informed, and believe that this impurity existed in the gas on the days mentioned by the Gas Examiner, and also at the time referred to in the memorial. I have the honor further to report, that after having made a careful inspection of the works, I am of opinion that the following are the principal circumstances which have occasioned the presence of these impurities in the gas : 1st.—That in consequence of a very large increase in the consumption of gas in the district supplied by the Independent Gas Light and Coke Company, during the present winter, as compared with that of preceding winters, the manufacture of gas has been extended beyond the present capabilities of the works. 2nd.—That although the Company have anticipated this large increase of consumption, and have entered into a contract for the erection of two additional purifiers, yet these purifiers are only now in process of construction. 3rd.—That the existing purifiers are not equal to the work which they are forced to perform; for not only are they too small for the perfect purification of the large quantity of gas which is forced through them, but they are also out of repair from continual working over a long period of time. 4th.—That in addition to the difficulty of properly purifying the gas by reason of the general incapacity of the present purifiers, another difficulty has been caused by an accident to one of the banks in which the spent or refuse lime from the wet lime purifiers is stored, and this has interfered with the regular use of the wet lime purifiers. 26 5th.—That the Company have been using for too long a time the Oxide of Iron supplied to them for the purification of the gas, and thus the purifiers have not had the opportunity of acting as effectively as they might have done, if they had been charged with fresher Oxide of Iron. 6th.—That as regards the purification of the gas from Ammonia, the processes in use at the works are very defective, for there was only a partial washing of the gas with water, in such a manner as to fail in the proper removal of this impurity. In conclusion, I have the honor to state as to the result of these inquiries, that I am of opinion the complaints in the memorial as to the impurity of the gas supplied to the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, by the Independent Gas Light and Coke Company, are well founded, and that the impurity is referrible to certain persistent defects in the works and not to any unavoidable cause or accident. I have, &c., (Signed) Hy. LETHEBY, M.B., M.A., &c. Professor of Chemistry in the London Hospital and Chemical Examiner of Gas for the City of London. 17, Sussex Place, Regent's Park. 26th January, 1865. TABLE I.

I inspected 2,101 houses; 213 cesspools have been abolished, 291 proper water closets have been erected in the place of open privies, all provided with proper trapped soil pans, and properly drained to the sewers; 88 house drains have been cleansed and repaired, a number of them that were old brick drains under houses have been taken out and glazed stone-ware pipes put in their place; attention has also been given to the paving of the yards, and proper provision made for improved surface drainage. Dust-bins have been provided for 119 houses; additional windows have been put in the back wall of 21 houses to improve the ventilation, and 10 houses that had been the seat of contagious disease were thoroughly lime-washed. These improvements have not been confined to any particular locality but distributed all over the parish; new sewers have been put into Thomas-street, Hackney-road, and Maria-street, where there were a number of houses that had not previously the means of drainage, these have been drained into the new sewers and greatly improved. The number of sanitary works executed since the establishment of the Vestry, are as follows: 3,206 cesspools have been abolished, 4,731 proper water closets have been erected in the place of open privies, and all properly drained to the sewers, 2397 houses have been cleansed and repaired, 895 dust-bins have been provided, and 186 houses have had an additional window put in to improve the ventilation. During the year, 6 complaints were made of pigs being kept so as to be a nuisance or injurious to health. Notices were given to the owners of the premises to have them removed which in every case was done. 33 In October last, several inhabitants of Shaftesbury-street, living near the drill ground and head quarters of the Rifle Volunteers, complained that from eight to ten barrels of gunpowder were stored in a vault under the foot-pavement in Sliaftesbury-street, they were alarmed at having so much explosive matter so near their dwellings, and complained for the purpose of trying to have it removed; on visiting the place, sixteen barrels were found on the premises, but it is proper to state, that the contents of these barrels was not all powder, but charges of powder and ball, made up in packages and placed in the barrels for safety. But a vault under the pavement of a public street, can not be considered a safe place to be used as a powder magazine, being exposed to accidents from without as well as from within. I reported the matter to the "Lighting and Paving Committee," and at their suggestion the authorities of the Volunteers were communicated with, and the powder removed to a place of greater safety. A complaint was made in one case, that the dead body of a woman was kept eleven days before being buried; and in another case, complaint was made that the body of a man, who had died of fever, was brought from the country to the house of his parents, there to be kept until the day of interment, the parents lived in a court containing eight small houses of only two rooms each, and as their was a family of six or seven living in the house, the neighbours were alarmed lest some of them might catch the fever and it should spread among the inhabitants of the court. Such cases as these, show the necessity and importance of providing a mortuary or dead house, where bodies might be kept in safety between the time of death and the day of interment; it requires no argument to prove that it is dangerous to the living to retain a body that has died from infectious disease in a house of two rooms where there are a family of six or seven living and sleeping. Should it require an Act of the Legislature to accomplish this object, it ought to be obtained as a security to the public health. One of the railway arches would be a suitable place for this purpose, being away from dwelling houses, and might easily be made available at small expense. 1 have made the usual stated periodical inspection of the licensed 84 slaughter-houses, 86 in number, and cow-houses 49 in number, and on all occasions found them generally satisfactory, and any thing required for improvement has always been promptly executed. In two instances, complaints have been made of cow-keepers having their dung removed at a late hour of the day, and annoying their neighbours by the smell, I cautioned them against this practice, which has sincc been discontinued. In the course of the year, 920 applications were made to have dust removed, which were all properly attended to by the contractor. The cleansing of the roads and streets has been generally satisfactory, during the winter several complaints were made of inefficient cleansing, caused by the state of the weather, which Avas at that season subject to sudden and extreme changes, that for a time rendered the cleansing a work of great difficulty. The want of properly constructed suitable dwellings for the working classes, still forms one of the great obstacles to sanitary improvement, the work of demolition proceeds rapidly, without any adequate means being taken to provide others; as a matter of course, in houses as in everything else, a short supply increases not only the demand but also the price, the consequent result is overcrowding, people are restricted in house accommodation from inability to pay the rent demanded for what they really require, the evil effects that flow from such a state of things are not confined to those of a sanitary character, but are equally injurious to the social and moral condition of the people. The great majority of the population of the parish being essentially industrious, are more easily affected with changes such as are now going on, and the present transition state must be got over before houses and rents are restored to a legitimate and permanent settlement. 35 The following Bills have been before Parliament this Session, and have been considered by the Parliamentary Committee. Great Eastern Railway—Metropolitan Station and Railway. This Bill was opposed by the Vestry, but has passed both Houses of Parliament. County Voters' Rejistration Rill. This Bill alters the law with regard to the Registration of County Voters, and the powers and duties of Revising Barristers. The Vestry do not oppose this Bill. Jung's Cross, Limehouse and Eastern Counties Railway. (Withdrawn January 1865). Church Rates Commutation. (Thrown out on a Division, May lltli, 1865). Metropolitan Sewage and Essex Reclamation Bill. The Vestry did not oppose this Bill. (Passed 19th June, 1865). East London Railway (Thames Tunnel Line). This Bill purposes to make a main line of railway from the parish of Bethnal Green, in the County of Middlesex, to Saint Paul, Deptford, in the County of Surrey, by a junction with the main line of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company, and a Branch line to the City, (No. 2 in the Bill), to commence in the City of London at or near Liverpool-street, and to terminate in the parish of Whitechapel by a junction with the main line. The branch line to the City will pass through a portion of Shoreditch parish, by crossing Commercial-street, Upper Blossom-street, High-street, Shoreditch, and Worship-street. The Vestry have succeeded in obtaining the insertion of Clauses in this Bill, for protecting the interests of this parish, as follows : 1.—Company to restore sewers, drains, &c. 2.—Sewers, drains, &c., to be under the control of the Vestry. 3.—Deficiencies in parish rates to be made good by Company. 4.—Works connected with such crossings to be completed within a certain period. 5. —Company not to interfere with roads or footways until notice given to Surveyor of the Vestry. 6.—Saving the rights, &c., of the parish of Shoreditch.

This Bill proposes to intrust the duty of extinguishing fires and protecting life and property from fire, to the Metropolitan Board of Works, with power to appoint and maintain firemen, engines, &c. The expenses of carrying out the Act, to be provided for by the Insurance Companies, the Commissioners of the Treasury, and the several parishes within the metropolis. 37 Erection of Town Hall. The following is the Report of the Vestry Hall Committee, as submitted to the Vestry on the 23rd January, 1865, and adopted. REPORT of the Vestry Hall Committee of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. Your Committee have to Report as follows: That upon the purchase of the site in rear of Fuller's Hospital being approved by the Vestry, the matter was referred back to the Committee, "to take the necessary steps to investigate the title and complete the purchase of the property."—" To make the Charity Trustees an offer of £2,500 for the site of Fuller's Hospital, Old Street Road,"— and "to consider the probable amount of money required for the purchase of the property and the erection of a Vestry Hall, and to take the necessary steps to apply to the Metropolitan Board for the sanction for borrowing the same." As to the Completion of the Purchase. Mr. Mills, the Solicitor, has informed the Committee, that the title to the land purchased is unobjectionable, and that the draft conveyance has been prepared, and is now before the several parties to join in the conveyance for their approval, and that in a very short time the purchase may be completed. The committee have made arrangements with the vendors that the rents shall be collected as usual, and that matter will be arranged at the settlement of the purchase. As the necessary amount cannot be borrowed under the sanction of the Metropolitan Board in time to pay the balance of purchase money, your committee would recommend that it should be referred to the Finance Committee, to consider if any portion of the balances standing on the several accounts of the Vestry might not be made temporarily available for that purpose. 38 As to the Purchase of the Site of Fuller's Hospital. Your committee have to report that they have made the offer to the Charity Trustees, as directed, and they have been informed by a communication from the Clerk to the Trustees, that the Trustees, subject to the sanction of the Charity Commissioners, and also to certain conditions are prepared to accept the same, and that the Commissioners have intimated their willingness, subject to conditions, to sanction the sale of the property to the Vestry, for the sum named, but the Commissioners have informed the Trustees that their official warrant for the sale will not be issued until satisfactory arrangements have been made for the temporary accommodation of the inmates, during the building of the hospital at Wood Green. Your committee therefore recommend that it be referred to them, with power to make any necessary arrangement with the Trustees for that purpose. As to the Estimate of the Cost of Building, &c. Upon proceeding to consider this question,—your committee found that it involved the whole matter of the nature and amount of accommodation required, the character and extent of the building, its style and design, and the quality of work to be done and material to be used, and unless the whole of those matters were defined, it would be useless to attempt even an approximate estimate of the cost. Your committee therefore considered this reference intended that the committee should consider the whole question, and not only furnish the Vestry with figures, but the plans and designs upon which the estimates were based, Your committee therefore called in the services of Mr. C. A. Long, who had been employed upon the question of site by the Vestry, and after several consultations with him, and fully considering the requirements of the Vestry and the Parish, directed him to prepare plans, embodying the committee's views thereon. In instructing the Surveyor, your committee had to consider not only the requirements of the Vestry and Parish according to their own judgment, but also whether the Vestry had expressed any wish, or had given 39 the committee any direction thereon, and your committee find that a resolution was passed on the 23rd day of April, 18G1, as follows:— "That it be an instruction to the Vestry Hall committee, that in "any steps which they may take towards providing a Vestry Hall, "to make provision for the accommodation of a large number of "Parishioners, (say 800 to 1,000), at Vestry and other meetings "relating to the affairs of the Parish." Your committee in considering how to give effect to this instruction, found that it would be necessary to provide two Vestry rooms, as the large Hall would be inconvenient for ordinary Vestry Meetings, and a room constructed for Vestry uses only, would be altogether unfitted for many public purposes connected with the Vestry and Parish, and inhabitants thereof, and they concluded that the best course would be to provide a smaller Hall, which they have denominated the Council Chamber, and a larger Hall, denominated the Public Hall. The plans herewith submitted for the approval of the Vestry, provide for a Public Office, Vestry Clerk's, Surveyor's, and Accountants's Office, Office and Laboratory for the Medical Officer and Chemical Examiner, Rate Clerks' Offices, Committee Rooms, Library, Sessions Room, Appellants Waiting Room, Council Chamber and Public Hall, beside the necesssary Rooms for Hall Keeper, Stores, Strong Room, Stokers and Furnace Room, &c., and considering the present amount of business devolving on the Vestry, and the continued increase of its duties, yearly imposed by successive Acts of Parliament, no less than the accommodation thus proposed to be provided, will meet the requirements of the Parish for all present purposes, and the probable contingencies of years to come. The question of cost also involves that of the design of the front and the material to be used. The Committee have considered it necessary that the design should be such as would indicate the public character of the edifice, not extravagantly ornamental, but of a substantial and durable character. They have rejected a mixture of brick and stone, which, however pleasing in its appearance in rural or suburban districts, is 40 unfitted for the dense atmosphere of the heart of London. Compo was suggested, but your committee considered the saving in the cost by no means sufficient to justify the use of a material which is extremely perishable, and continually requiring repair; and though the cost will be increased a few hundreds of pounds, they consider that the advantage of a good, substantial, and durable front, will moredhan compensate the Parish for the additional expense incurred, and they, therefore, recommend that the front should be of Portland Stone. Your committee, therefore, beg to submit to the consideration of the Vestry, and for their approval, five plans prepared by the Surveyor, under the direction of your committee, viz : — 1.—A plan of the basement story. 2.—A plan of the ground floor and council chamber. 3.—A plan of the upper floor, consisting of the public hall. 4.—A longitudinal section shewing interior. 5.—A view of the principal front. Your committee, desirous of obtaining great permanency, instructed the Architect in preparing the estimate to make provision for the best materials and workmanship throughout the entire building, and he has accordingly laid before the committee, the following estimate: Cost of land in rear of Almshouses £4850 Cost of Almshouses 2500 Conveyance, Interest, &c., say . 150 £7,500 Cost of Building, as per plan £15,500 Cost of gas fittings and heating apparatus 550 Cost of furniture for offices, hall, & chamber 1,000 Architect's charges and commission 800 Contingencies 150 Total . £18,000 Your committee, therefore, recommend the Vestry to approve the plans and estimates, and to refer the whole matter back to the com- 41 mittec, with power to complete the purchase of the land, to prepare specifications for inviting competition, and to apply to the Metropolitan Board for power to borrow the sum of £25,000—and to make such other arrangements as may be necessary to carry out the intentions of the Vestry, preliminary to their contracting for the erection of the building. All of which is submitted to the consideration of the Vestry. J. LONG. 23rd January, 18G5. Chairman. The purchase of the land in the rear of Fuller's Hospital, has been completed; specifications, plans, &c., are being prepared by the Architect. The Metropolitan Board have given their sanction to the Vestry to borrow the sum of £22,000 for the purchase of the site and the erection af the building, and the necessary arrangements arc being made for completing the purchase of Fuller's Hospital, selling the materials and clearing the ground for the erection of the building. The Special Sanitary Committee. The Special Sanitary Committee have met 20 times, and have examined 2130 houses, and other premises, during the year, they reported to the Vestry in December, 1864, as follows : REPORT. Your committee were appointed on the 20th day of October, 1863, for the purpose of making an inspection of the dwellings of the poor, and other premises, in the parish, with a view to ascertain the sanitary condition of same, and what improvements could be effected therein, In accordance with the directions to this committee "to report from time to time to the Vestry, on the several matters referred to them," the committee beg to lay this their first yearly report before the Vestry for their consideration. 42 Your committee have met 36 times during the year, and with the Clerk, Medical Officer, and the Inspector of Nuisances, have been to 124 streets, courts, or alleys, and have inspected 2452 houses. Your committee beg to report that by their instructions, 476 notices have been served by the Inspector on the owners or occupiers of the property requiring improvements, and that it is with great satisfaction your committee have to report, that such orders are being generally complied with. Your committee in carrying out their scheme of making a thorough and impartial house to house inspection, have of course not limited their visits to the houses of the poorer classes, but have with equal care examined houses of every description. They are happy to be able to report, that the great majority of the houses of the better class are well drained, and otherwise in a satisfactory condition, but that they have met even here with numerous instances of defective sanitary provisions, such as to fully prove the desirability of comprehensive inspection. Your committee have been gratified to observe the pleasure with which they have been received by the occupiers of the smaller houses in the parish, showing that they were desirous of improving the sanitary condition of their dwellings, but as your committee believes a want of independence prevented them from obtaining that which your committee by their orders promptly carried into effect. Your committee have recommended proceedings should be taken against certain persons who have neglected to carry out the orders of the committee, and they are happy to state, that in all cases, by the advice of the Clerk, backed by the valuable evidence of the Medical Officer, the Magistrates have made the orders required, and the Inspector has been unremitting in carrying their order into effect. Your committee have had occasional meetings for the purpose of hearing applicants who have any explanation to offer why the orders served upon them should not be strictly carried out, and it is gratifying to your committee to state that the parties themselves have fallen in with the views of your committee, and in all cases the orders of the 43 committee has been complied with, by the diligent perseverance of the Inspector. Your committee are assured that the improved sanitary condition of the dwellings of the poorer classes, and a strict attention to cleanliness by the occupiers of such dwellings will tend to improvethe health and habits of the people, enable them to struggle against and overcome pauperism; and eventually relieve the ratepayers in reducing the amounts that are annually required for the relief of the Poor. Your committee are aware of the immense labours that have been entrusted to them, but have made up their minds strenuously to grapple with the duties they have undertaken, being perfectly aware by the experience of the last twelve months of the large amount of benefit that will be the result. Your committee beg to append to their report, the following statement, showing to the Vestry the number of orders given by them during the year, viz,: Cesspools abolished 163 Drainage of premises, properly constructed, cleansed connected with sewer, etc. . 226 Dust-bins provided s 048 Houses & premises cleansed, repaired & lime-washed 157 Pigs removed ______ 7 Water—proper supply required 226 Water-closets constructed, properly repaired, panned, and trapped 201 Ventilation—windows required 290 Yards, fore-courts, and areas, repaired, and surface drainage restored 315 And that the Inspector has given the proper notice in all the cases and has reported to your committee from time to time the progress that has been made in each case. That the thanks of this committee be given to the Clerk, for the able report drawn up, and also for his general attention to the affairs of this committee during the past year.
