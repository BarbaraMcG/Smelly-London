OVERHEAD WIRES. In consequence of the heavy fall of snow which took place on the 26th December, 1886, the whole of the wires passing over the District were broken in one place or another. The broken wires were strewn on the foot and carriageways, and the men employed by the Board and the police in many cases cut the wires and removed them from the thoroughfares. No damage occurred in consequence of the storm having happened in the night, but if, the storm had taken place in day time there is no doubt that most serious accidents would have been caused. in my report to the Board upon this subject I made certain suggestions with a view to the prevention of accidents by the breakage of overhead wires, and the same were communicated to Sir Joseph Bazalgette, the engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Works, as requested by him SNOW STORMS. Heavy falls of snow occurred on 26th December, 1886, and 14th and 15th March 1887. A large number of extra men were employed in addition to the Board's men for the purpose of removing the snow from the footways and forming crossings and clearing the snow from the readways. The snow was removed by the contractors of the Board under their contract, a large additional number of carts, being engaged in the work. The cost paid by the Board amounted to £60 16s 2d. CONTROL OVER DEMOLITION OF OLD HOUSES. A communication was received from the Metropolitan Board of Works dated 16th March, 1886, referring to the fall of certain houses in Holloway Road, and the recommendations of the Coroner's Jury which enquired into the circumstances, namely, that the Metropolitan Board should obtain Parliamentary powers giving the District Surveyors control over the pulling down of old houses. The Metropolitan Board asked to be furnished with particulars of instances which might have occurred in the District within the last three years, of danger arising from the demolition of buildings and suggested that the demolition of building near public thoroughfares should be carried out subject to Bye-laws to be appproved by the Home Secretary, that the District Surveyor's expenses be charged upon the site of the building, and that the Metropolitan Board or District Surveyor have power to order the necessary hoarding or other works, and the diversion of the public traffic. The Metropolitan Board were informed that no accidents of the nature referred to had occurred in this District, inasmuch in every case a sufficient hoarding had been put up as required to protect the public, and that with regard to the powers proposed to be obtained, the District Hoard saw no objection to the suggestion that power be District Surveyors to control the pulling down of dangerous buildings in or near public thoroughfares, but strongly objected to and would oppose any interference with their rights us to the erection of hoardings and the regulation of the public traffic, the existing powers vested in the District Board being in their opinion sufficient tor the purpose. MAKING UP AND PAVING NEW STREETS. The works in connection with the making up, paving, and draining, &c., of Selsey Street and the making up, paving, draining and erection of a concrete retaining wall at Tomlin Terrace, Limehouse, have been carried out by the Board's contractors. The coat of the work was as follows, viz.:— Selsey Street £214 3 3 Tomlin Terrace £333 3 10 The above amounts were apportioned amongst and paid by the owners of houses and premises in and abutting upon the said streets. PROPOSED BIRCHFIELD STREET IMPROVEMENT. A communication was received from the Poplar District Board enquiring whether, having regard to the erection of the London and County Bank premises at the corner of Birchfield Street and East India Dock Koad. and the arrangement with that Board by which a portion of the ground formerly enclosed by the wall of the house No. 52, East India Dock Road was to he given up to form part of the public footway, this Board would be disposed to co-operate with the Poplar Board at the present time on the Wis of the Joint Report of the Surveyor of the Poplar Board and myself, dated 15th June, 1883, in extending the improvement as shewn upon the plan attached to such Report. When the improvement was proposed in 1883, this Board resolved that in the event of the London and County Banking Company waiving all compensation for the land required for the improvement the subject matter be again considered. It now appeared that a portion only of the lana required for the improvement was proposed to be given up by the London and County Bank and that it was not proposed to set back the frontage of the Bank premises in Birchfield Street to the line shewn on the plan accompanying the Joint Report of the Surveyors before referred to, and it was consequently resolved that no action be taken in the matter. Subsequently the Poplar Board became possessed, by arrangement with the London and County Banking Company, of a piece of land at the northern end of Birchfield Street within the Limehouse District. This was thrown into the public thoroughfare, widening it to the extent of the Bank premises, and upon the completion of the necessary works of forming the footpath and paving the additional portion of the carriageway (at the expense of the Poplar Board) this Board took the additional width under its jurisdiction upon condition of the Poplar District Board undertaking to widen and pave the remaining portion of the street upon the expiration of the existing leases. VENTILATION OF SEWERS In consequence of the many complaints of the escape of effluvia arising from the ventilating grates and gullies of the main sewers in might be given for the deodorisation of the sewage at that point in addition to the same process which was being applied to the other main lines of sewers in the District, so as to prevent the discharge of offensive and noxious gases therefrom. The Metropolitan Board complied with this request, the result of the deodorising operations being very satisfactory. COAL AND WINE DUES. Representations having been made to the Board from several Districts in the Metropolis as king the Board to consider the question of continuing the Coal and Wine Dues at proposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works and the corporation of the City of London, resolutions were pasted in support thereof Delegates were appointed to attend a conference upon the subject the offices of the Whitechapel District Board, and a petition was presented to the House of Commons in favour of the Coal and Wine Dues Continuance Bill. DR. BARNARDO'S HOMES, STEPNEY CAUSEWAY. Application was made on behalf of Dr. Barnardo for permission to form a Subway under Stepney Causeway from the Boys Home on the west side of that street to the new Infirmary on the cast side. The Board granted the application upon certain conditions of repair and removal when required, and upon payment of a nominal rent of £1 per annum for the user of the Subway, a deed to be executed embodying such conditions. The Board was also requested to make certain alterations in the width of that portion of the roadway opposite Dr. Barnardo's Homes so as to prevent the frequent blocking of the street which is very inconvenient, not only to persons visiting the Homes but to the public generally ; also to pave the widened portion of the roadway with asphalte in lieu of the present pitching. The Board consented to execute the works at the expense of Dr. Barnardo. STOPPACE OP SHOULDER OF MUTTON ALLEY, Notice was given to the Board by Mr. Frederick Machin, of Broad Street, Ratcliff, of his desire to stop up a certain disused passage or highway situate in the Hamlet of Ratcliff, between Butcher Row and the Orchard, formerly known as Shoulder of Mutton Alley, on the ground that such disused passage was unnecessary. It appeared that the thoroughfare in question was cloned by the Trustees of the Hamlet of Ratcliff nearly half a century ago, in consequence of its being the resort of bad characters and facilitating the escape of thieves, since which time Bere Street, a short distance off. was formed, which made the old alley of no use to the public. The Board directed that the necessary steps be taken to obtain an Order of Justice to entirely atop up and abandon the alley. ARTIZANS AND LABOURERS DWELLINGS' ACTS. Brook Street Area. The Metropolitan Hoard of Works have demolished the whole of the houses comprised in the above ana and have formed new thoroughfares, the carriageways and footways of which have been paved with new stone, and the necessary sewers and gullies nave been formed, and the necessary lamps for lighting the area fixed. Tench Street Area. The Metropolitan Board of Works have demolished the houses comprised in the above area situate in the Parish of St. George-inthe-East. A portion of Green Bank comprised within the area has been widened by the Metropolitan Board. Cable Street Area. This area is still under the consideration of the Metropolitan Board of Works. HOUSES BELONCINC TO THE BOARD IN WHITE HORSE STREET. The lease of the above premises being near its expiration notice to repair was served upon the lessee. Soon after the Metropolitan Board of Works served dangerous structure notices calling upon the owner to pull down and rebuild certain portions of the premises. Upon a representation by the lessee the Board resolved that if the lease was given up at that time, being some six months before the expiration thereof, the Board would undertake to do the structural works required by the Metropolitan Board, which works were afterwards carried out. The houses are now let by the Board to weekly tenants. Bills in Parliament. Petitions were presented to the House of Commons in favour of the Regent's Canal City and Docks Railway (Extension of Time) Bill, and against the Hyde Park Corner (New Street) Bill, and the Public Parks Works Bill. Thames Communications. The Metropolitan Board having resolved to apply to Parliament for powers to construct a tunnel communication under the Thames from Blackwall to Greenwich Marshes, this Board presented a memorial to the Metropolitan Board calling their attention to the Report of their Engineer submitted in November, 1882, recommending that a tunnel should constructed from Shadwell to Rotherhithe, and also to the recommendation of the Select Committee of the House of Commons that a Subway should be constructed at or near Shadwell which would be central, and would best meet the wants and wishes of the inhabitants cant of London Bridge, and praying the Metropolitan Board not to construct the proposed Blackwall Tunnel until a communication should hare been established between the north and south sides of the river at or near Shadwell. The Metropolitan Board, however, deposited plans and Sections, and a bill for powers to construct the Blackwall Tunnel, and Delegates were appointed by this Board to meet Delegates from other Districts to consider what action should bo taken. i am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. BOARD OF WORKS LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH for the year 1886. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Report on the Health and Sanitary condition of the Limehouse District for the year 1886. The Births registered in the District during that period numbered 2,016, giving the proportion of 34.4 births to 1,000 inhabitants, a number considerably below the average of the last ten years. The Birth Rate of the Metropolis for the year was 32.3 per 1,000. 2 The Marriages registered in the District numbered 400, giving a proportion of 13.6 persons married in 1,000 inhabitants. This is the lowest rate of which I possess any record, and is considerably below the average rate of the last ten years. The number of persons married in the Metropolis gave a proportion of 16.6 per 1,000. The Deaths in the District during the year exclusive of tho#* of non-residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated in the District, but inclusive of those of residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated beyond the limits of the District, numbered 1,470. The Kate of Mortality was 25 per l,000 that of the Metropolis being 19.9 per 1,000, and of the Eastern Districts 22.5 per 1,000. The excess of the Death Rate of the District over the Death Rate of the Metropolis extends through all classes of disease thus, the Death Rate in the Metropolis from the principal Zymotic diseases, such as Meales, Fever, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhœa was 2. 69, while in the Distric it was 3.82 From Constitutional Diseases such as Cancer and Consumption it was 8.89, against 5.23 in the District. From Developmental Diseases it was 1.21, against 1.87. From Local Diseases, i.e., Diseases it Nervous System, of Circulatory System, of Respiratory System, &c., it was 10.10, against 11.87, and from Violence it was .68 against 1.10 in the District. This result is the outcome of the conditions under which a large proportion of the inhabitants of your District exist; conditions which for many of them mean indifferent lodging, insufficient food and clothing, hard toil, and exposure to the elements. The Death of Children under one year constituted 24.4 per cent., and those of Children under 5 years 44.2 per cent. of the total mortality. 3 Diseases of a Zymotic Character caused 239 deaths, of which 39 were duo to Measles, 23 to Scarlet Fever, 56 to Whooping Cough. 7 to Diphtheria, and 18 to Enteric Fever. The Rate of Mortality from the seven principal diseases of this class was 3.8 per 1,000. Constitutional Diseases causal 307 deaths, and included 31 from 1 Cancer, 69 from Tabes Mesenterica, 36 from Tubercular Meningitis and 143 from Phthisis. The Death Kate in this class was 5.23 per 1,000. Developmental Diseases caused 110 deaths, and included 34 from Premature Birth, and 73 from Old Age, The Death Kate in this class was 1.87 per 1,000. Local. Diseases caused 696 deaths and included 24 from Inflammation of the (train. 60 from Apoplexy, and Allied Diseases, 35 from Convulsions, 77 from Heart Diseases, 219 from Bronchitis, and 114 from Pneumonia. The Rate of Mortality in this class was 11.87 per 1,000. Violence caused 65 deaths, and included 20 from Fractures and Contusions,8 from Burns, 25 from Drowning, and 10 from Suffocation. The Kate of Mortality in this class was 1.10 per 1,000. There was an entire absence of Smallpox in the District. Scarlatina prevailed more or less throughout the year. There were Several case* of Enteric Fever in the Autumn, more especially in the neighbourhood of Butcher Row and the Orchard, while there was a marked diminution in the number of cases of Diphtheria. There was, however, in the Autumn a severe outbreak of Measles, affecting principally that portion of your District which lies eastward of the Burdett Road. In the interest of the public Health, I deemed it advisable to recommend the closing of the Infant Department of the Board School in the locality, which was done, after which the outbreak subsided 4 Sanitary Work, &c. The usual routine inspection of houses was carried on during the year; 3,165 houses having been inspected and 2,456 orders for the amendment of the same having been issued. The supply of water to closets was prosecuted steadlily. and and without protest on the part of the landlords. with the result that it was obtained in 320 cases. Seven hundred houses were registered under the provisions of 35th section of the sanitary Act of 1866. The Bakehouses, Cowhouses. and Slaughterhouse were regularly inspected. Under the provisions of the Canal Boats Act, 27 Canal Boats were registered, and 104 inspected. Besides these. certain Factory Nusiances were on more than one occasion, the subject of the Board's consideration; among them 1 may mention the Brooksby Chemical Works, Bow Common; the Animal Charcoal Works, New Gravel Lane, Shadwell, and Mr. Fisch's Furrier Premises in Gill Street. The Brooksby Chemical Works, had, at the time it became the subject of complaint, ceased to be a manufacturing premises for at least nine months; previous to that time the place had been used an a manufactory of manure, chiefly from blood, and, as such, it was the subject of numerous complaints. Then it wan used as a depot for putrid fish, which was collected in various parts of London, brought hither, discharged on the ground, and placed in tanks for conveyance elsewhere; naturally the nuisance was very great at times, and at length, the owner on July 7th, in consequence of the action of this Board, gave an undertaking to vacate the premises in a month; the premises were not vacated in anything like a month, but the operations were carried on in such a way as to cause far less nuisance, and occupation was given up about the middle of September. As no manure had been made on the premises for nine months, the license held from the Metropolitan Board of Works expired, and is not renewable. The Animal Charcoal Works in New Gravel Lane is an old offender, but complaints regarding it during the year were few and 5 trivial. New plant had been put up, and the process was not so offensive as it had been, hut there was a tendency to accumulate bones on the premises far in excess of the quantity required for a reasonable term of manufacture, and the premises had to be watched, and warnings given from time to time. As regards the Furrier's Premises in Gill Street, the nuisance complained of, arose partly from dust, partly from smoke, and partly from smell. The dust arose form the beating of the skins which had had Mahogany sawdust trodden into them, the smoke from the burning of refuse sawdust, and the smell from the storing of fleshings Measures have been adopted which appear to be successful, at least for the present, but without care, a repetition of the nuisance might easily occur. In October the Metropolitan Board intimated that they intended to apply to Parliament in the ensuing session for powers to deal with the Cable Street area under the provisions of the Artisans and Labourers' Dwellings Acta. My official representation under these Arts was dated October 3rd, 1883, and you are doubtless aware of the ultimate proceedings with regard to it: You can therefore understand that it was a source of gratification to me, after all the vicissitudeas of that representation, to find that my efforts to purge the District of a singularly unsavoury and unhealthy locality, promised at last to be crowned with success. Cow and Slaughter Houses. These structures were again licenced after conforming with the requirements of the Board. Sale of Food and Drugs' Act. One hundred and one samples of Food were examined at the laboratory. Of these 12 were Breads, 3 of which were adulterated with Alum. Twenty-nine were Milks, of which 3 were adulterated 6 with water in the proportions of 7, 9 and 15 per cent Five were Butters of which one was adulterated with 78 per cent of foreign fat. Four were Flours, all genuine. Nine were Mustards of which one was adulterated with 40 per cent. of Wheat Flour, and coloured with Turmeric. Ten were Beers all satisfactory in quality. Ten were Peppers of which two were adulterated with 50 per cent of Rice Starch. Four were Arrowroots, nil genuine, and ten were Coffees, all genuine; seven were Cocas, of which 5 were mixed with Sugar and Starches in variable quantities. I have pleasure in acknowledging the great assistance I have received from the Inspectors, who have Carried out my instructions in an intelligent and satisfactory manner. I have the honour to remain, gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. A. ROGERS, Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst. Board's Offices:— White Horse Street, September, 1887. 7 TABLE I.
