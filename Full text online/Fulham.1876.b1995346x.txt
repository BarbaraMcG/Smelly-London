During the laying-out building-land on the Gunter Estate, opposite Wellington Road, the Board were enabled to arrange, through the liberality of the landowner and leaseholder, for a great improvement of this road, by setting-back the line of frontage,—the Board kerbing and paving the newly formed footpath and making-up the carriage-way. The Board have received the consent of the landowner to a continuation of this improvement northward to Beaufort House, and only await the consent of the leaseholders to carry it into operation.  £ S. d. £ Jm d.

The Board have re-opened negotiations for the improvement of Queen Street, by putting back the boundary fence of the churchyard, and hope to be able to effect this work during the ensuing year. Brook Street. In course of the progress of the paving works, at the cost of owners of property in Brook Street, Hammersmith, the Board obtained the consent of the landowners for the removal of the Bar which stood at the Queen Street end of the road, and there is now an uninterrupted thoroughfare between Bridge Road and Queen Street Blythe Lane. Previously to commencing the construction of the second portion of the Blythe Lane Sewer, the Board entered into communication with the owners of the land abutting on this road, with a view to the improvement of the thoroughfare, which resulted in a give-and-take line being agreed with the owners on either side of the lane extending from Shepherds Bush Road to Masbro' Road,— the Board undertaking, to erect a rough fence at certain points of the new boundary, at a very small cost; and the lane has been widened from Shepherds Bush Road to Masbro' Road from its original breadth of about 22 feet to an uniform width of 40 feet. Uxbridge Road. The Board are glad to be able to report that they have succeeded in effecting an improvement in this most important thoroughfare, by setting-back the fence or frontage line extending from St. Stephen's Church to Aidine Lodge,—the Board undertaking to erect a rough post-and-rail fence to mark the new boundary upon land given-up adjoining Aldine Lodge. North-Pole Road. An improvement has also been carried out in this road by arrangement with the War Office,— the Board setting-back the post-and-rail fence upon the north side of the road from the Railway Arch to Wood Lane. Other Street Improvements. The Board have had under lengthened consideration the question of various important improvements, and are now 16 preparing an application to the Metropolitan Board upon the subject. Wandsworth Bridge Road. The Board report the conclusion of the litigation with the Wandsworth Bridge Company in relation to this road. After the late trial, when the Company failed in their endeavour to thrust this unfinished road upon the ratepayers, the Board agreed to take to and make the road and paths,—the Company previously depositing a sum of £1750, in payment of the estimated cost. The works are now in progress, and a good substantial road will soon be open to public traffic. Mayland Road Sewer. In this case the Board were unsuccessful in their endeavour to obtain payments from the owners of property abutting upon the street, of the cost of reconstructing the sewer therein, which had been found defective, and has been relaid. Stamford-Brook Ditch. This long-standing cause of complaint from inhabitants in the north-western part of the parish of Hammersmith has been constantly under the consideration of the Board, and negociations are now proceeding with the Metropolitan Board of Works, which the Board hope will result in the construction of a new sewer, and consequent removal of the grave evils arising from the present open ditch. The Board have during the past year done all that was possible to abate the nuisance, by the free use of disinfectants. Albert Place Drainage. This matter has been many times under the consideration of the Board and the Sanitary Committee, who have carried into effect temporary remedial measures from time to time. Application has now been made for permission to construct a new sewer, and the Board will be able to report the final removal of this cause of complaint at an early date. New Sewer, West side Brook Green. By arrangement with the owners of certain portions of land abutting upon the road at the west end of Brook Green, who 17 paid a contribution of £100 towards the cost, the Board have constructed a sewer—affording an outlet for the drainage of the property there. Open Spaces. Wormholt Scrubbs. The Board understand that arrangements are being made between the War Office, (the Lords of the Manor,) and the Metropolitan Board of Works, for the preservation of this Common as an open space for the recreation of the public, and that a scheme is now being prepared. Eelbrook Common, Brook Green, Parsons Green. The Board are informed that the Metropolitan Board of Works are taking steps to deal with these Commons under the Act for the Preservation of Open Spaces. Shepherds Bush. Arrangements are being made by the Metropolitan Board of Works for raising the surface level and otherwise improving this Common, and the necessary works may be expected to be completed by the end of the year. Metropolitan District Railway Extension Works. In the course of the year the works for connecting the District Railway with the London & South-Western Railway at Hammersmith were commenced, and shortly afterwards it was apparent that the Company, in constructing the line under the Broadway, The Grove, and Bradmore Road, would considerably raise the surface levels. The Board immediately entered into communication with the Company—protesting against the carrying-out of the works, and pointing out that the deposited plans and sections shewed the level of the public roadways to be unaltered. The Company declining to make any alteration, alleging that they were empowered to proceed under the provisions of the Railway Clauses Act, the Board then proceeded for an injunction against the Company, which was obtained, but set aside upon appeal by the Company ; and at the close of the year the Board are still in communication with the Company, with a view to arranging for the works to be carried out so as to interfere as little as possible with the level of the roads, and trust that a favorable settlement will ultimately be made. 18 Mr. Churchyard's Case. In the early period of the year, Mr. Churchyard, a Builder, submitted a plan for the construction of a 40-foot road, leading out of London Road, Fulham, which was approved by the Board ; but, upon the matter coming before the Metropolitan Board of Works, that body declined to sanction the plan, upon the ground that the road as then laid out would form a cul-desac,—there being no exit into Dawes' Lane. Upon this decision being communicated to Mr. Churchyard, he stated his intention of laying-out the land in twenty-feet courts, under the provisions of the Act, and he has now commenced building cottages upon the site. The Board much regret that the plan for a forty-foot road was not agreed to, as the erection of cottages upon such a site will certainly not tend to increase the value of the surrounding property; and the Board fear an opportunity of improving this locality is now lost. Inundations. The Board are sorry to have to record very serious inundations caused by the overflow of the River Thames within the district, producing great distress and suffering among the poorer classes exposed to its effects, and exceedingly heavy pecuniary loss to others by the destruction of articles of merchandise and furniture ; and by the wide-spread devastation of growing-crops belonging to market-gardeners. Thames River (Prevention of Floods) Bill. A Bill has been introduced into Parliament during the present Session by the Metropolitan Board of Works, with the avowed object of enabling the Vestries and District Boards to carry-out or to cause to be carried out such works as may be necessary to prevent the overflowing of the said River Thames within the limits of the metropolis. After careful consideration of the clauses of the Bill, it appeared that, under its provisions, almost unlimited powers of control over Vestries and District Boards were sought to be vested in the Metropolitan Board of Works, in relation to the carrying-out such works as they might deem necessary or sufficient for the purpose of protecting the metropolis from floods or inundations,—such proposed works being of an entirely undefined character; the Metropolitan Board being empowered 19 to call upon parishes or districts to execute such works as they might order; and, in the absence of any provision or protection in the Bill, this might have entailed upon the district a charge of such enormous amount as would have crippled its resources for many years to come. Although the Board most fully realised the absolute and pressing necessity for some legislative action, they felt compelled, in the interest of the ratepayers, to enter into opposition to the Bill; and so strong was the feeling against the injustice of the Metropolitan Board's proposal, that most of the riparian districts petitioned against the measure, and active steps were taken by all parties to raise an earnest opposition to the scheme, with a view of obtaining a more equitable adjustment of the necessary burden than that provided by the Bill. Upon the Bill being read a second time in the House of Commons, it was ordered that it be committed to a select committee of eleven members—six to be nominated by the House, and five by the committee of selection. It was also made an instruction to the committee — that they have powers "to enquire into and report upon the most "equitable mode of charging and meeting the expenses to be "incurred under the Bill." And it was subsequently ordered that Petitioners be entitled to be heard by Counsel, Agent, or Witnesses, upon their petitions against the Bill. The select committee are expected to meet early in May, when the Board trust that the result of the energetic action that has been taken will be shewn in equitable terms being arranged, so that the great work of protecting the low-lying portions of the metropolis may be shortly commenced. The Mall (obstructions). The Board having had occasion to remove building materials and other matters and things placed upon the public highway known as the Middle Mall, Hammersmith, adjoining the old Red Lion public-house, the owner of the materials summoned the Board for removing the said materials, claiming a right to the land upon which they were placed as his private property. The obstruction still being continued, it is feared that, in their endeavour to preserve the public rights, the Board may be forced into litigation in this matter. 20 Toll Bridges in the Metropolis. A Bill having been introduced into Parliament for the purpose of enabling the Metropolitan Hoard of Works to take measures for freeing from toll the remaining toll bridges in the metropolis,—the Board, looking at the question as one of vital importance to the best interests of the District, have used every endeavour to promote the passing of the Bill, which is likely to become law during the present session. Public Lighting. The Board have had under serious consideration the annually increasing cost of carrying out this work, and resolved to have meters affixed to several street lamps in the district, as an experiment, for the purpose of obtaining reliable data to assist them in their efforts to bring the expenditure under this head to a lower amount. Street Nomenclature, etc. Under the direction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Board have, during the past year, caused the following streets to be re-named:— Dartmouth Road renamed Glenthorne Road. Dartmouth Place „ Banim Street. Farm Place, etc. „ Vanston Place. Market Place, etc. „ Jerdan Place. Carpenter's Row, etc. „ Mclmoth Place. Oxford and Cambridge Terrace „ Ellerslie Road. Denmark Road „ Faroe Road. Masbro' Road North „ Redan Street. Ceylon Road „ Milsom Road. New Kings Road „ Broxholm Road. And have served notices for renumbering in the following streets:— The Grove Number of Houses 244. Glenthorne Road „ 135. Bridge Avenue „ 65. Latymer Road „ 493. 21 Pillar Letter-Boxes. Upon application by the Post-Office authorities, the Board have sanctioned the erection of additional Pillar Letter-Boxes in the district, viz.:—The Grove, Godolphin Road, Netherwood Road, and Loftus Road. After twenty-one years' service as Medical Officer of Health for this district, Mr. F. J. Burge tendered the resignation of his appointment, which the Board accepted with much regret; and a superannuation allowance was granted to Mr. Burge upon his retirement. In thus announcing the retirement of Mr. Burge, the Board take the opportunity of testifying to the faithfulness and zeal with which, during the whole period extending from the formation of the Board up to the present time, Mr. Burge has discharged the onerous duties of his office. The Board have appointed Mr. N. C. Collier to the office of Medical Officer of Health. The Board having had their attention called to the system of book-keeping in use in the office—a system which, however satisfactory in the early period of the Board's proceedings, had Medical Officer of Health.

Notices issued 4515. 22 been during 20 years quite outgrown by the natural development of the district, and the consequent increase in the amount and complexity of the various accounts, the matter was referred to the Finance Committee, with power to call in the assistance of an Accountant. After numerous meetings and consultations, the Committee having inspected the methods of book-keeping adopted at various District Boards and Vestries, it was resolved to initiate the system now in operation, which the Board has reason to believe will be found satisfactory. In making this alteration it was necessary to appoint a person to keep the books, and the Board selected and appointed Mr. E. F. Tomkins to the post of Accountant. At a subsequent period, the question of continuing the payment of the Surveyor and Clerk to the Board partly by amounts charged upon the cost of works executed in new streets—under the provisions of the 105 sec. 18 & 19 Vic. c. 120, and 77 sec. 25 & 26 Vic. c. 102,— and partly by fixed salary, came under the consideration of the Board ; and after careful enquiry and discussion, the Board resolved to put an end to the arrangement made in the year 1864; and that, after the 25th March, 1877, the Surveyor and Clerk be paid by salary only—which resolution the Board trust will be found to have effected a change conducive to the interests of the district and to the due discharge of this important branch of the Board's labours. Cartage, etc. Some two years ago the Board abandoned the system of letting out the various works, such as Slopping, Watering, &c., to contract at a lump sum, and have adopted the plan of contracting for the supply of Horses with Harness, and Men to drive, at per day,—the Board finding the Cart, Van, or other vehicle required, believing that by so doing they obtain a larger amount of work, better done, and at less cost than under the old contract system. The Board have now in use 17 of Bailey's Patent Hydrostatic Water Vans, which are found to be a great improvement upon the old fashioned carts. The Vans have been purchased at a cost of £60 each, and the payment spread over a period of three years. Twelve new Slop-Carts have also been purchased. Two light Carts have been obtained for the Superintendents of Works. The Horse formerly in use at Hammersmith being sent to Fulham, a new one being purchased at a cost of £38, for use in 23 Hammersmith, and is also driven in the Waggonette used for conveying the View Committee in their periodical inspections of the District. The Board have also Six Cart-Horses which are used for various works of Cartage, four being employed at Hammersmith and two at Fulham. An additional Horse Roller (4 tons) has been purchased for use in the District. The subject of the collection of Dust and Ashes in the District has given the Board considerable anxiety, this work being still carried out under contracts; after much consideration, it was resolved to appoint two persons, one in each parish, as Inspectors of Dusting ; and the Board are glad to be able to report that the experiment has been successful, a great diminution in the number of complaints being observable. Appended is a return shewing the amount of work done in Watering. 1293 hired horses—whole day's work. 141 do. half do. „ 16 do. one hour „ The Board supplied 196 horses—whole day's work. 98 do. half do. „ Slopping and Cleansing. 3105 hired horses—whole day's work. 139 do. half do. ,, 45 do. one hour „ The Board supplied 132 horses—whole day's work. 38 do. half do. „ About 17,900 loads of slop and road scrapings removed.

Gentlemen, In my twentieth Annual Report, which I had the honor of presenting to you last year, I laid before you a summary of the Sanitary work which had been carried out within the Fulham District during the two previous decades. There is little to add to it for the year 1876. The ordinary inspections have been made, and the usual proceedings for the removal of nuisances have been prosecuted under the directions of the Sanitary Committee, whilst some much required additions have been made to local drainage. The chief feature of the year has been the outbreak of Small-Pox in London towards the latter part of it, in which the Fulham District has shared. Under the authority of the Sanitary Committee the usual precautions have been taken, including the prompt removal of cases to hospital accommodation where practicable, and the destruction of infected bedding and clothing. The total mortality of the District during 1876 has been 1963,—a number of deaths which compare favourably, considering the almost incalculable additions to our population from immigration ; but, even taking the excess of births over deaths as a basis of calculation, it is remarkable. The number of Births registered within the District were 3315, showing the excess of births to be 1352. The deaths from the various Zymotic diseases have been as follows :—Small-Pox, 3 ; Measles, 67 ; Scarlet Fever, 98 ; Diptheria, 9 ; Whooping Cough, 47 ; Typhus Fever, 4 ; Typohid Fever, 18; Simple Fever, 6; Diarrhoea, 131; and English Cholera, 12. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, FREDk. J. BURGE, Mcdical Officer of Health. Hammersmith, January, 1877. APPENDIX No. 4.
