Paving Jobbing Works. In March 1873, a Contract was entered into by Mr. George Gammon Rutty, for the execution of the Paving Jobbing Works, but Mr. Rutty, tailing to carry out the provisions of the same the Vestry in June 1873, rescinded the contract and accepted a Tender of Mr. William Etheridge the late Contractor, for the execution of the said works up to the 25th March, 1874. at a schedule of prices. Improvement Works. Upon the rebuilding of the houses Nos. 200 and 201 Rotherhithe Street, a small improvement was effected by setting back the houses and the purchase by the Vestry of the slip of land in front of the same at a cost of £21 10s. 0d., which land has been paved and thrown into the public footway. The removal of the old houses, and premises on the north side of Rotberhithe Street, near the Thames Tunnel for the erection of Messrs. Brandram and Co's. new Warehouse allowed of an improvement being made in the Street, at that spot by the setting back of the front of the new building in a line with the property on the east side thereof, which improvement will by arrangement with Messrs. brandram be carried out without cost to the parish. 16 After negociations with the Owner of the property and the Metropolitan Board of Works the Vestry have arranged for the widening of Rotherhithe Street, at the King and Queen Granary, by the purchase of the ground in front thereof, formerly enclosed by iron rails, at a cost of £500, one moiety of which cost the Metropolitan Board of Works have agreed to contribute upon the completion of the improvement, and the other moiety will be defrayed by the Vestry.

During the past year 164 Notices have been served in duplicate under the "Nuisances Removal Act" upon complaints made by the Medical officer of Health, and Inspector of Nuisances, 162 of which have been abated by the removal of the cause of complaint and two are standing over. A nuisance having been created at No. 517 Arch of the South Eastern Railway by the storing of offensive matter for manure, a summons was in June 1872 issued, at the Greenwich Police Court against Mr. Charles Williamson, the Occupier of the Arch, upon the hearing of which the Magistrate fined him £5, but he failing to remove the Nuisance he was summoned a second time and fined £10 half of the latter fine was however ultimately mitigated upon the Defendants abating the Nuisance and quitting the premises. 17 The Vestry caused letters to be written to the Directors of the South Eastern and Brighton Railways calling attention to the Nuisances that are constantly springing up under the Arches of the Railways, and urging that they take steps to prevent the letting of the same for the carrying on of noxious businesses. The Corporation of London as the Sanitary Authority of the Port of London have appointed Dr. Harry Leach as the Medical Officer of Health for that Port, to whom at his office in the Foreign Cattle Market, Deptford, all communications on Sanitary matters and cases of Cholera in connection with the Shipping in the River Thames or in the Docks, are to be sent.

Miscellaneous. A plan shewing a suggested new line of communication between London Bridge and the Creek Bridge Deptford having been submitted to the Vestry by the St. Olave's and St. Saviour's District Boards and the Vestry of Bermondsey the Vestry considered the same and being of opinion that the proposed new Road as shewn upon the plan would not benefit this Parish, and that a more economical improvement might be effected by the widening of the existing thoroughfares at several places westward of Rotherhithe there being already an excellent Road from Rotherhithe to Deptford, the Vestrv suggested to the Delegates of the several Parishes before mentioned, the modification of their plan accordingly, but such suggestion not being acceded to, the Vestry approved of a Plan prepared by Mr. George Legg carrying out their views, which plan was presented to the Metropolitan Board of W orks with a Memorial in support thereof, in reply to which in October 1872 the Vestry received a letter to the effect that the Board without entering into the merits of the scheme, upon which it was not prepared to express an opinion, considered that the heavy and pressing matters which had devolved upon it under the Street Improvements Act rendered it impossible for it to enter for the present upon the consideration of the improvement suggested by the Vestrv, the Board had accordingly decided to adjourn the consideration of the subject until the month of July 1873. The Vestry in August 1872 having been informed that the School Board for London were in treaty for sites in Union Road to build schools, called the attention of the Board to the number of schools already in existence iu that part of the Parish and requested that any new schools might be erected in some other parts, where they were more required and directed the attention of the School Board to the District west and south of Southwark Park as suitable for such purpose there being in that locality a large and increasing neighbourhood with little school accommodation. The Vestry have since been informed that the London School Board have abandoned their intention of erecting schools in Union Road. The Freeholders of a portion of the property in Trinity Place next Trinity Street having placed a fence across the passage to the same the Vestry instructed their clerks to enquire into and report as to the legal right of the Freeholders so to do, upon which the clerks reported as follows:— "It having been referred to us to report as to the legal right of the Freeholder to stop up this Court or Place, we have enquired into the facts of the case and find that on the 30th September 1811 a Lease was granted of what was then a piece of ground 30 feet wide by 209 feet deep for 61 years from Christmas 1811 at the yearly rental of £16 the Lessee was bound to build two or more houses within years. I t appears that two houses were built fronting Trinity Street, a Court was left on the South side 20 of the ground and three Cottages built at the end or west side thereof. The lease expired Christmas 1872 and the Lessee was bound to give up quiet possession to the Lessor or his representatives. It also appears that for many years this court has been repaired and lighted by the Parish Authorities and further that other houses have been built upon adjacent property belonging to a different Owner, the only way to which is through this court. As the Lease has expired the Lessors right to the property reverts and consequently he can legally shut up and fence off this Court, there cannot be a legal dedication to the public by any Lessee or any other person than the Owner of the Freehold. "Wood v. Veal 5 B and Ald 454." The Vestry therefore resolved to take no action in the matter. The Valuation (Metropolis) Act 1869. Under the provisions of the above mentioned Act the total Assessment of properties in this Parish has been raised during the past year from Gross £179,352 10 0 Rateable £138,709 to Gross £182,251 10 0 Rateable £141,189. APPENDIX No, I. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, From 1st of April, 1872, to 31st March 1873. The Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen, During the last seven years, it has been my duty to deliver to you, an annual state ment of the Parish of Rotherhithe; so far as regards the number of births and deaths that have occurred therein, and to touch on other matters, wherein the health of the inhabitants is concerned. The investigation of these matters for the period alluded to, affords conclusive evidence, that the occasional remark we hear, of this parish being an unhealthy place, is made without the least foundation; and can only issue from persons who are not sufficiently informed on the subject, or others, who make rash statements, without enquiring into the circumstances of the case. It is usual to determine the prosperity and healthfulness of a district, by the increase in the number of births, and the relative number of births and deaths; examined by these tests, we have great reason to be satisfied with the result; the births have gone on steadily increasing, with the exception of about two years, when the chief branch of industry in this place, that of building and repairing Ships became depressed, and 21 this depression of trade seemed to have a corresponding effect on the increase of population. The rate of mortality is low, and may be compared without disadvantage with some of the most healthy parishes in London, we have had a death rate as high as 22.19 per thousand, and as low as 17.14, the average for the seven years having been about 2050 while that for all London has exceeded 23 per thousand. On the present occasion, I have the pleasure of submitting to your notice, a very satisfactory annual account of the condition of the parish, indicated by a low rate of mortality, and a large increase in the number of births ; the number of deaths has not materially diminished, but they are much less than usual in the epidemic class of diseases, and as this kind of disease, is supposed to be more under human control than many others, we may fairly ascribe to the sanitary measures employed, some success in mitigating the intensity, and warding off the destructive effects of disease. The table below will illustrate the relative number or deaths occasioned by some of the most important epidemic diseases, during the last seven years.

Four fatal cases were registered, one described as continued, two typhoid, and one enteric. Scarlatina caused thirteen deaths. Small-pox, three. Measles, four. Whooping Cough occasioned twenty one deaths. Diarrhoea. Thirty-three fatal cases were registered which are beyond the average number and twenty-five of these cases were under two years of a^e. Births. The registered births amount to one thousand and six, four-hundred and ninetv-four males, and five-hundred and twelve females, this is the highest number ever recorded for this parish, and exceeds that of the former year by one-hundred and seventy-one, and the registered deaths by four-hundred and seventy-one.

Fortveight Inquests were also held, and twenty one of these persons were not residents in this parish; from the five hundred and seventy three registered deaths we must therefore substract this number, and nineteen which occurred in the Infirmary sent from other parishes, so that the actual number of deaths due to Rotherhithe, will be five hundred and thirty three, and the rate of mortality, making allowance for increase of population. As compared with the two previous years, will be as under. No. of Deaths. corrected Per Thousand. From March 31, 1872 to April 1, 1873 573 533 18.75 „ 31, 1871 to April 1, 1872 574 527 18.83 „ 31, 1870 to April 1, 1871 615 567 20.25 The mortality among the very young continues large; children suffer most severely from epidemic diseases, affections of the lungs, convulsions, and diseases indicating a low state of vital power when born, and insufficient nourishment afterwards According to age, the relative number of deaths were:— Under 2 years of age 213 Between 2 and 5 years of age 47 „ 5 10 „ 19 „ 10 20 „ 24 „ 20 30 „ 38 „ 30 40 „ 49 „ 40 50 „ 37 „ 50 60 „ 46 „ 60 70 „ 47 „ 70 80 „ 39 „ 80 90 „ 12 „ 90 100 „ 2 573 The death of a female was registered 95 years of age. Included in the five hundred and seventy three deaths, we shall find epidemic diseases caused about seventy six deaths, diseases of the air passages and lungs one hundred and sixty, and diseases of the nervous and circulating system, inflammatory 23 complaints besides those already mentioned, some diseases of children, and forty eight inquests, made up the remaining three hundred and thirty seven deaths. For the abatement of nuisances it was necessary to serve one hundred and sixty four notices; a few summonses were also issued, which were attended with a successful result in every case; and it affords me satisfaction to state, that during the last seven years, no process has been issued in any of the superior Law Courts. An .unusual form of nuisance occasioned more than ordinary trouble; a person from Stoke-upon-Trent, rented an arch of the South Eastern Railway Campany, situated in this parish, and deposited therein some tons of a substance technically called "Pure," this mis-named stuff' is the excrement of dogs; it was sent from the midland Counties in casks, deposted in a tank, and then subjected to a process of stirring and other manipulation, which caused an intolerable smell; this "Pure" is used by Tanners, and whatever consideration a nuisance of this description might receive, in a neighbourhood where the business of Tanning is carried on, it was certainly unfair to introduce it into a parish where there is not a single Tanning establishment; the first step taken to remove the nuisance was by notice, which received no attention, a summons was then issued, and after two hearings at the Greenwich Police Court, it was arranged that the Magistrate should visit the premises, who declared a nuisance to be in existance and inflicted a fine; this fine was paid, but did not cause the removal of the nuisance,and a second summons was issued, the fine doubled, and the defendant left the premises a few days afterwards. No complaints have been made of the quantity or quality of the water supplied by the Kent Water Company, but in accordance with annual custom very loud complaints were made of insufficient quantity received from the Southwark and Vauxliall Water Company, in some parts of the parish the scarcity was so severely felt, as to induce the inhabitants to send a memorial to the Vestry, the supply however improved, and further action was not deemed expedient. The panic caused by the Cattle plague having subsided, the business of Cowkeeping seems to be flourishing, the animals are more numerous, and lodged in more commodious and better constructed premises than formerly, when inspected, the Cowhouses were found in fair condition. No complaints could be made of the condition of the Slaughter-houses, when they were periodically inspected. The state of the Bake-houses when they were inspected, was on the whole satisfactory. The Dusting and Scavinger's work has been performed during the year, as well as on former occasions. For the assistance you have given me in the discharge of my duties, and the co-operation of my colleagues, I return my best thanks.
