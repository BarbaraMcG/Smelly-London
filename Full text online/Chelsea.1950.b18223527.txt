LOBBAN 3 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF CHELSEA Public Health Department, Town Hall, King' s Road, Chelsea, S.W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my first annual report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for the year 1950. I took up my appointment on 27th February, 1950, when my predecessor, Dr. W.H.L. McCarthy, who had been acting in a temporary capacity since June of the previous year, retired after some twentysix years service with the Council. I should like to make the following general observations on the public health statistics:- The population of the Borough continues to rise, and is estimated by the Registrar-General to be 52,490, compared with 51,990 in 1949. The figures for this year, however, include military personnel stationed in this area. These are believed to total approximately 150. The actual increase in civilian population can, therefore, be assumed to be 350. The total number of births decreased from 875 (Males 479 Females 396) in 1949, to 829 (Males 426 - Females 403), a difference of 46. It will be noticed that male births fell by 53, whilst female births increased by 7. The birth rate for the year was 15.8. Still Births increased by 7 compared with 1949, when the figures were Males 9, Females 8. They now read - Males 12, Females 12. The Death rate (12.2) also shows an increase over 1949 (11.1). Nevertheless it is satisfactory when compared with the rate of 14.6 for 1939, whilst during the period of hostilities, much higher rates obtained, due in no small measure to enemy action. If the populations of all areas were similarly constituted as regards the proportions of their sex and age group components, their crude death rates (deaths per 1,000 population) could be accepted as valid comparative measures of the mortalities experienced by the populations. In practice, however, populations are not thus similarly constituted, and the Registrar-General has accordingly calculated a factor (called the Area Comparability Factor) for each district. This is, in effect, an adjustment of the age and sex composition of the district to that of England and Wales as a whole, so that all may be compared on the same basis. To obtain the adjusted death rate, 4 the crude death rate is multiplied by the Comparative Factor which has the effect of making a corrected death rate comparable with the death rate of any other district which has been similarly adjusted,, The Area Comparability Factor for Chelsea is 0.95, and the death rate for 1950 when so adjusted is 11.6. It is gratifying to record that, for the fourth consecutive year, no deaths occurred from accidents and diseases associated with pregnancy or puerperal pyrexia. The infant mortality rate for 1950 was 25 per 1,000 births, as compared with 26 in 1949, 40 in 1948, and 44 in both 1947 and 1946. The rate for the year under review is the lowest ever recorded,, In 1900 the rate was 148 per 1,000 live births. There was a sharp rise in the number of Infectious Disease notifications received, and subsequently confirmed, by the Public Health Department. The total was 837, as compared with 616 in 1949. The increase is largely accounted for by the following additions:Dysentery 107; Food Poisoning 1163 Whooping Cough 47. More detailed information on these matters will be found in the "Infectious Diseases" section of my report. Four hundred samples of food and drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination,, Of this total, only 13 were reported as "adulterated", mainly due to labelling defects, but in no instance was recourse to legal proceedings necessary. All premises concerned with the preparation, storage and sale of food were subjected to constant supervision, whilst all persons engaged in such premises were kept fully aware of the responsibilities vested in them to ensure the highest possible standards of cleanliness,, In addition to her normal duties, the Woman Sanitary Inspector carried out a detailed survey of food handling establishments. In all 483 food premises were inspected, and full details of the volume of work involved will be found in the section devoted to "Inspection and Supervision of Food". She has also laid great emphasis on strict attention to cleanliness in every aspect of the preparation, storage and sale of ice cream, the value of which will be seen in the table showing the gradings of ice creams submitted for analysis. The care of Old People is a matter which has been diligently dealt with by the Public Health Department throughout the year. An Old People's Welfare Committee meets at regular intervals to consider ways and means of brightening the lives of such persons, whilst the Borough Council makes an annual grant to the above Committee to help further this excellent work. Details of some of the work done during the year are included in this report. 5 The District and Housing Inspectors continue to be actively engaged in the provision and maintenance of satisfactory housing conditions, as required by the Acts, Orders and Regulations which govern this section of the work of a local authority,, It will be noticed that the total number of visits carried out by these officers during the year has increased by some 1,000 compared with 1949, but the reading of statistics does not give a true picture of the tremendous amount of work the total of 19,350 visits has involved,, To cope with the increased volume of work, the clerical side of the establishment of the Public Health Department has been increased by one officer. In conclusion I would like to thank the Chairmen and Members of the various Committees for their sympathetic consideration and interest in the problems which have from time to time arisen during the year, and at the same time to express my grateful appreciation of the co-operative manner in which the members of the staff of the Public Health Department have consistently performed their duties. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Yours obedient Servant, J.H. WEIR, Medical Officer of Health. 6 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF CHELSEA ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1950.

INFANT MORTALITY The deaths of infants under 1 year of age totalled twenty-one, and the death rate in Chelsea was 25.3 per 1,000 live births as compared with 26.3 last year. The infant mortality rates for England and Wales, and London were 29.8 and 26.3 respectively. Of the twenty-one deaths recorded, sixteen were under the age of four weeks. The death rate of 25.3 is the lowest ever recorded in Chelsea, and It will be of interest to note how it has arrived at its present satisfactory level during the last half century.

No notifications of Diphtheria were received during 1950, as compared with one in 1949, a most satisfactory position which emphasises the importance of Diphtheria immunisation. dysentery. One hundred and seventeen confirmed cases came to the notice of the Department during the year, as compared with only ten in the previous year, Eighty-one actually occurred amongst members of a "Homeless Families Unit" resident at an institution under the control of the County authorities, The premises concerned were of a type far from conducive to the adequate control of the persons amongst whom the disease was rife, but every possible step was taken to ease the situation, and by the end of the year the incidence of the disease was practically negligible. FOOD POISONING. There was a very considerable increase in the number of cases of Food Poisoning dealt with during the year. these totalling 122 as against 6 in 1949. This rise was most unfortunately connected with outbreaks occurring at local hospitals,, In the first instance 66 notifications were received, and it is most regrettable to record that four of the patients succumbed to the effects of food poisoning,, The situation was further aggravated by the fact that all sufferers were of advanced age. The other hospital outbreak resulted in 34 persons being notified as suffering from food poisoning, but happily no deaths resulted in this instance. A summary of all cases occurring during the year is set out below in similar form as supplied to the Ministry of Health. Annual Return of Food Poisoning Notifications Notifications of Food Poisoning were made up as follows:- First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Total 2 74 44 2 122 Outbreaks (other than family outbreaks) due to identified agents:- Total Outbreaks: 1 (Agent-Salmonella typhi=murium) Total Cases: 2 Family Outbreaks due to Identified .agents:- Total Outbreaks; 1 (Agent - Salmonella typhi-murium) Total Cases: 2 14 Annual Return of Food Poisoning Notifications (continued) Outbreaks (other than family outbreaks)of undiscovered causs:- Total Outbreaks: 3 Total Cases: 102 Family Outbreaks of undiscovered cause:- Total Outbreaks: 4 Total Cases: 7 Single Cases:- Agent identified (Salmonella typhi-murium) 3 Unknown cause 6 Total cases:9 MEASLES, Three hundred and eighteen notifications of Measles were received during 1950, as compared with 302 in 1949. POLIOMYELITIS During the year, six notifications of Poliomyelitis were received, only three of which were subsequently confirmed. One paralytic case was discharged from hospital thirteen days after admission as being completely recovered. The remaining two cases were of a non-paralytic nature, and after receiving hospital treatment were discharged, and have since been in good health. SCARLET FEVER. Fifty-five cases of Scarlet Fever received the attention of the Department during 1950. an increase of eighteen over the notifications for 1949. SMALLPOX. No case was notified to the Public Health Department as having occurred within the Borough during the year. A number of contacts were closely supervised, none of whom developed this disease. TUBERCULOSIS. During the year, 75 new cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and 3 cases of Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis were notified. In addition, 46 new cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and 3 new cases of Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health through other sources, making a total of 127 (Pulmonary - Males 66, Females 55; Non-Pulmonary-Males 3, Females 3). 15 The total number of cases of Tuberculosis in the Borough at the end of the year was 425, made up as followss:- Pulmonary: Males 193 Females 203 Non-Pulmonary: Males 9 Females 20 TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. During the period under review,the following work was carried out at the Dispensary. The figures in parentheses relate to similar work in 1949.

In this regard it is suggested that consideration should be given to the formulation of codes of practice appropriate to the various trades, such codes to include basic principles on the lines of an accompanying schedule, with, where necessary, additional principles specific to each particular trade. It is further suggested that the conference should consider the possibility of instituting a system of nominating food hygiene officers for each food handling establishment, and, if agreed, that intensive instruction of such officers should be undertaken. The Conference would also present an opportunity to discuss the question of the general instruction of employees in food hygiene by means of such media as lectures, talks, films, posters and metal plaques, 4, That measures be taken for the promotion of knowledge among the public in matters of food hygiene. 31 5. That the present eductional and enforcement work of the Council1 s Food Inspector should be continued and extended by the appointment of an additional Woman Sanitary Inspector. I subsequently prepared "Notes on Food Hygiene" and provided a copy of same to each member of the Public Health Committee„ Briefly these set out how food may become infected and the diseases resulting therefrom, with stress on food poisoning, and finally the measures to be adopted to ensure the highest possible degree of eduction in the field of food hygiene. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. Two hundred and twenty-seven samples were submitted for bacteriological, examination during the year. Details of the results of examinations will be found in the following table:- Article examined Found not to conform to standard Unsatisfactory Satisfactory TOTAL • Baking powder 1 1 Biscuit cones - 1 1 Browning - - 1 1 Chow-Chow — — 1 1 Custard powder - — 1 1 Flour — — 1 1 Herrings (tinned) - — 2 2 Jam - - 1 1 Margarine - - 1 1 Meat — 2+ 9 11 Meat (crab) — 1 1 Milk 2 — 45 47 Peanuts — — 1 1 Picalilli — — 2 2 Sugar - — 1 1 Water - — 43 43 Yeast Extract - - 1 1 REPORTED UPON ELSEWHERE Ice Cream - 16 94 110 TOTALS: 2 18 207 227 + Found to contain organisms likely to cause Food Poisoning. 32 MILK SUPPLY. Under the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, a local authority is required to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of milk distributor, and of all premises used as dairies (other than dairy farms) in their district, and to remove from the register the name of any person who ceases to trade as a milk distributor, and of any premise which ceases to be used as a dairy premise. On 31st December, 1950, the register showed the following details:- Number of registered distributors with premises in Chelsea 32 Number of registered distributors other than above 13 Number of premises in Chelsea registered as dairies 1 1 Number of premises in Chelsea,, other than dairies, from which milk is distributed 30 During the year, 86 applications were received, and licences were granted under the Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949, and the Milk (Special Designation )(Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, authorising the use of special designations in relation to milk sold at or from 33 premises within the Borough, 36 supplementary licences were granted in respect of milk sold by retail within the Borough from 15 premises not in the area of this authority. Details of licences granted were as follows: ;Type of Licence Tuberculin Accredited Pasteurised I Sterilised I TOTAL Tested Principal 25 7 29 25 ! 86 Supplementary 11 - 13 j 12 36 No pasteurisation or sterilisation of milk took place in the Borough during the year, such processes having been carried out in other areas. 33 ICE CREAM. One hundred and ten samples of Ice Cream were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service for "Methylene Blue" tests. The following results were received;- Grade I 63 Grade II 27 Grade IXI 13 Grade IV 3 106 The remaining four samples were coloured ices which did not respond to the test. During 1949, examination of Ice Cream samples resulted as follows;- Grade I 11 Grade II 13 Grade III 13 Grade IV 19 56 It will be apparent that the quality of Ice Cream has much improved in the Borough, due in no small part to the vigilance of the Council's Food Inspectors. As a matter of interest it will be observed that whilst practically twice as many samples of Ice Cream have been dealt with during 1950, those appearing in Grade I number almost six times the total similarly graded in 1949. At the same time, it is gratifying to report that particularly in regard to the number of samples submitted for tests, the proportion of those graded either III or IV has much declined. The traders whose Ice Cream receives these latter gradings are advised of the unsatisfactory results obtained. In respect of Ice Cream produced outside the Borough, it is customary to advise the particular Medical Officer of Health when poor gradings are notified. A legal standard for Ice Cream was not in force during the year, but was under consideration for introduction in 1951. 34 SAMPLING OF FOOD AND DRUGS During the year, four hundred samples were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination,, Of this number, one hundred and seventy-five were "Formal", and two hundred and twenty-five "Informal".

Of the 175 formal samples submitted to the Public Analyst for examination, only 1 (0o57%) was adulterated,, 225 informal samples wer also dealt with and of these, 12 (5o33/0 were reported as adulterated,, In all instances vendors or wholesalers were communicated withQ In so cases balances of stocks were surrendered and/or destroyed? where breaches of labelling orders had occurred, manufacturers agreed to make necessary amendments to their packings,, SURRENDER OF UNSOUND FOOD,, During the year 1950, approximately 9,721 pounds.of unsound or diseased food was surrendered to and destroyed by the Council's Food Inspectors,, The foodstuffs mainly contributing to the above aggregate were as follows? - lbs0 CerealS 307 Fish, fresh 1,096 Fish, tinned. 415 Fruits, dried 194 Fruits, tinned 1,666 Fruit juices 326 Meat, fresh 713 Meat, tinned 2,111 Milk, tinned 371 Pickles, Sauces, etc 343 Preserves - Jams, Marmalades, etc0 245 SOUpS 201 Vegetables 881 38 WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE. The borough Council has at all times shown great interest in the welfare of Old People, and no stone is left unturned in endeavouring to bring at least some measure of pleasure into the lives of those who may be lonely or suffering from infirmity,, An Old People's Welfare Committee is constantly working with this goal in view, and is in receipt of a grant of £350 per annum from the Borough Council to assist it in its workc The co-operation of such associations as the London Council of Social Service, the National Old People's Welfare Committee, the Women's Voluntary Services, the British Red Cross, and numerous other publio=spirited bodies is also much appreciated,, Throughout the year, a "Meals on Wheels" service has been operating for four days in each week, and by this means persons who would otherwise find great difficulty in preparing meals for themselves are relieved of both anxiety and trouble in this respect, During the year approximately 8,840 cooked meals were delivered to the homes of aged and infirm persons, Two Clubs are available for Old People in the Borough, and amongst the facilities of which they can take full advantage are a meeting hall, canteen, men's and women's rooms, toilets, and a library, whilst a piano and a radiogram have proved very popular. The following is an indication of the varied services which have been given during 1950:- Arranglng for admission to hospital 13 Issues of food parcels 35 Provision of Home Helps 51 Arranging for admission to institutions 17 Assistance in regard to securing housing accommodation,, 9 Provision of clothing, 39 Provision of furniture 17 Arranging holidays 25 Provision of items of bedding 21 Provision of chiropody services 55 Visits to persons on register prior to 1950 732 Visits to persons added to register during year 576 At the present time a comprehensive register of all persons who are aged and/or infirm is being prepared, and whilst, at the end of the year, 160 cases were receiving help in one form or another, it is most desirable that information should be available in regard to all persons who are eligible for some assistance, and, in addition, those who may in the near future gain a little comfort from the knowledge that they will also be helped, 39 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT „ 1948. 1 PERSONS IN NEED OF CARE AND ATTENTION. (Section 47) As in 1949, recourse to legal proceedings to secure the removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention proved unnecessary, It has always been the Public Health Department's policy to secure the co-operation of those persons whose infirmities render it essential that they receive adequate care, and the soundness of such an approach to a difficult problem is fully borne out by the fact that in thirty=two instances admissions to hospitals & were arranged in practically every case by friendly discussion,, 2„ BURIAL OR CREMATION OF THE DEAD., (Section 50) In accordance with the provisions of the above Act, a local authority is required to make arrangements for the burial or cremation of the body of any person in respect of whom no other suitable arrangements can be madeQ During the period 5th July to 31st December, 1948, 43 interments were arranged, whilst during the whole of 1949, necessary action was taken in 25 instances. In March , 1949 , the Minister of Health reconsidered the application of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1.948, and it was decided that Hospital Committees and Boards should arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of patients dying in hospital under the following circumstances; - (a) Relatives not being tracedj (b) Relatives being traced, but who were not, immediately before a patient's deaths liable for his (or her) maintenance under Section 42(1) of the National Assistance Act 1948, and are not wilHrtg todandertakfe the arrangement bf burial or cremation; and (c) Relatives not being able to obtain a death grant under the National Insurance Act, 1946, and unable to accept financial responsibility for burial or cremation expenses. Responsibility for the interment or cremation of the great majority of persons who die in hospitalswill therefores not fall to the local authority,, Nevertheless, the latter deal with such cases as may be referred to them by hospital authorities owing to the failure of a liable relative to assume his or her responsibility, whilst the Borough Council has also to make the necessary arrangements in respect of the bodies of persons dying in their own homes in such cases as enquiries for liable relatives have proved fruitless,. Section 50(4) of the Act provides that "an authority may recover from the estate of the deceased person or from any other person who for the purposes of this Act was liable to maintain the deceased person immediately before his (or her) death, expenses incurred. 40 During the period under review, the Public Health Department was called upon to arrange burials, as follows:- Adults 8 Children (under one year of age) 1 —>o0o—-= PHARMACY & POISONS ACT. 1933, Under the provisions of this Act it is necessary for all persons trading in poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List to be included in a local authority' s listo During the year, 50 applications were received for inclusion in the Council's list, three of which were new registrations. The trades carried on at the premises concerned were as follows;- NQq of premises Grocers & Provision Merchants 22 Departmental and Domestic Storekeepers 17 Hairdressers 9 Drug StorekeeperS 1 Builders' Merchants 1 TOTAL§ 50 PUBLIC MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT., An agreement exists between the Chelsea and Hammersmith Borough Councils whereby the latter authority has made available excellent facilities,, During 1950 the number of bodies removed to the Mortuary numbered 216, whilst 210 post-mortem examinations were madep and inquests held on 51 cases0 RODENT CONTROL„ The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, which became operative on 31st March, 1950, is much more advantageous to a local authority in dealing with rodents than the Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1919, which has been repealed0 The new Act empowers a local authority to take all practicable measures to rid its area of rats and mice. Under the provisions of the Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1919, the primary duty for the eradication of these particular pests rested upon the individual occupier0 With the advent of this new legislation, an occupier is guilty of an offence if he fails to destroy rodents or use hi3 best endeavours to prevent an infestationQ 41 During the year9 the following work was carried out:- Treatment of Business and Private Premisea.
