No. XIV.] HAN 11 QUARTEELY SUMIARY OF THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY OF Saint Jeorge, Hanoberr Square AND OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH, FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH 30th, 1861. With Summary of the Year. LONDON: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, s.W. . TO THE Destry of St. Gorge,Hanober Square. I. MORTALITY. My Lords and Gentlemen, The mortality during the quarter ended March 30, 1861, has been high; nearly as high as during the corresponding quarter of last year. Five hundred and forty deaths have taken place in the 13 weeks, if we include 13 in the Little Chelsea Workhouse and 73 of non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital. Deaths from zymotic diseases have been 74; amongst which we notice 10 from measles; 28 from various forms of scarlatina and sore throat; and 16 from whooping cough : diarrhœa, as usual in cold weather, gives only two deaths. Lung diseases have destroyed 132 persons, besides 69 who died from consumption : these are numbers which point to a low thermometer. Generally speaking, all causes of death seem to have acquired unusual intensity from the cold; and infants, weakly persons, and the aged, fell victims in great numbers : and it will be seen by comparing the table of this quarter with that of the same quarter last year, that the high death rate in the former is more due to miscellaneous causes and deaths of the aged, than to lung disease specially. 4 Amongst the zymotic diseases, we notice measles fatal to 9 children, exclusively of the poorer class in the Hanover sub-district, and to 1 in Belgravia. Scarlatina destroyed 2 children in the May-fair sub-district; at 4, Old Bond-street, and 4, John's-court ; and 16 in the Belgrave: viz.—at 20, Sutherland-street; 3 at 16, Wallace's-yard; 144, Cambridge-street; 24, Queen-street; 14, Lower Belgrave-place; 3, York-place; 2, Ecclestonstreet, South; 39, Cumberland-street; 49, Tachbrookstreet; 2 at 47, Coleshill-street; and 2 at 47, Eburystreet. Scarlatina is more fatal to persons of a higher class than the measles. A death from diphtheria took place at 35, Maddox-street, (see report No. XIII.;) others at 6, Gloucester-street; 15, Burton-street; 8, Graham-street, West; and 14, Whitaker-street. Six women died after childbirth; 1 a young woman, æt. 20, at 22, Hay's-mews; 1 at 2, Street's-buildings, from cold after an exhausting labour; 3 others from exhaustion after labour; and 1 from puerperal fever. The deaths from accidental causes are numerous and instructive. One child of 7 months was suffocated in bed with its parents; 1 of 2 weeks died of shock from cold; 5 at least are said to owe their death to dry nursing; and 7 were burned or scalded. One child at 30a, Grosvenor-mews pulled a cup of hot tea over himself from a table; another drank hot water from a kettle; the son of a blacksmith was burned at the forge; the clothes of a girl at school caught fire at the grate; a boy of 5 the same, from reaching something on the mantelpiece ; another," the manner not known "; and a poor girl of 16, a servant, set her clothes on fire by the heater of a tea urn. Besides these, a dressmaker fell into the fire when fainting. 5 Two elderlywomen committed suicide; one by hanging, the other by drowning; and a man who was dying of phthisis cut his throat ineffectually, inasmuch as he recovered from the wound sufficiently to die a natural death from the disease. A young man of 24 was drowned whilst skating; 1 servant was killed by falling from a board supported on a ladder whilst cleaning a skylight; another in trying to open a window fell into the yard; a journeyman baker fell and broke his neck whilst carrying a sack of flour down stairs; and 5 other men died of broken bones from falls in the discharge of their daily duties, as mechanics or labourers. Besides these must be mentioned a newly-born infant found in Hyde Park, which appeared to have died a natural death. II. THE SICKNESS. The number of persons who received gratuitous medical attendance this quarter at the Dispensary in Mount-street, and at the hands of the parochial surgeons, was 913. Last year the number was 947 in the corresponding quarter. Out of the 913, 175 were affected with bronchitis; 27, rather a large number, with.diarrhoea, 19 with measles, 1 with small-pox, 2 chicken-pox, 2 scarlatina, 4 whooping cough, 1 dysentery, 1 cholera, 13 continued fever, 1 erysipelas, 1 diphtherite, and 1 pleurisy. The case of small pox occurred in a boy, vaccinated, named Adams, set. 6, of 26, Blomfield-place. The disease was mild. He caught it apparently at the Catholic School, Davies'-mews, by infection from an unvaccinated child, whose parents reside at No. 2, Oxford-house, Grosvenormarket, and have but lately come into the parish. An 6 infant in this family was vaccinated, the apartments cleansed, and the Roman Catholic clergyman written to on the subject of the rule against admitting unvaccinated children into the school. Here follows an account of some of the poorest streets, with their probable population, the number of cases they have contributed to the above account of sickness, and the deaths of children, and of adults. Population. Cases of illness attended gratuitously. Deaths of children. Deaths of adults.

There were 4 cases of measles followed by diphtherite at No. 6, two of them fatal, besides 3 other cases of illness; there was a case of fever at No. 11, and one of dysentery; 2 cases 7 of diarrhoea at No. 3. No. 17, Little Grosvenor-street contributed 7 cases of illness, including diarrhoea and fever. There were 9 patients from No. 2, John's-court; Robert-street also was very sickly. In the Belgrave Sub-district, 6,410 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul's and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these, 3,444 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 2,966. We find that the total included 1 of small-pox, 18 of chicken-pox, 6 of measles, 30 of scarlatina, 53 of whooping-cough, 113 of diarrhoea, 2 of dysentery, 35 of continued fever, 65 of rheumatic fever, 12 of erysipelas, 1 of diphtheria, and 2 of ague, 1 of which occurred in a non-parishioner at St. George's Hospital, and the other at No. 2a, Commercial-road South. There were 514 cases of bronchitis, 16 of pleurisy, and 24 of pneumonia. NUISANCES IN THE HANOVER AND MAYFAIR SUB-DISTRICTS. Cases in which Legal Proceedings were taken. Lancashire-court, Nos. 2 and 3. There had been much sickness in almost every house in the court, [although they were subject to constant inspection; and these two houses in particular were so thoroughly dirty and dilapidated, and so unfit for the residence of any but the most squalid and reckless persons, that it was determined 8 to appeal to the magistrate, at Marlborough Street, and to ask him to pronounce them unfit for human habitation. A summons was accordingly taken out, and the owner appeared, on the 5th March, in answer to it, by his agent, Mr. Berry. He admitted the statements made on behalf of the local authority by the Medical Officer of Health and Inspector, and consented that an order should be made by the magistrate, in the terms of the 13th section of the Nuisances' Removal Act, that the houses were unfit for human habitation, and that should not be used again as habitations until rendered fit for that purpose. The Medical Officer of Health particularly called the attention of the Magistrate to the rotten state of the floors, on the plea that they were altogether unfavourable to cleanliness, for they could not be washed, and harboured vermin and filth underneath. The magistrate expressed great regret at not being competent to order these houses to be pulled down ; but he gave orders that they should be cleared of their occupants, and disused as habitations, as he was requested. The notice embodying his order was drawn up with some difficulty by the aid of Mr. Capron. The houses have since been entirely cleansed, painted, and coloured ; decayed flooring removed, and the spaces under the floors of the upper rooms cleared out and dosed with chloride of lime. A new water-closet and cistern has been erected for each house, and the inlets trapped. The drains had been made good by a previous magistrate's order. Thomas-street, No. 36. The whole of this house was in a very dilapidated condition: ceilings cracked and threatening to come down, drains stopped up, front area covered with filth, floor of kitchen rotten, house universally dirty, and damp from the overflowing of a rainwater pipe at the back. Proceedings were taken, and the 9 case heard at Marlborough Street, at the same time as the foregoing case. The highly respectable owner of the house admitted the charge, and consented to the magistrate's order, that the house should be disused as a habitation until rendered fit for that purpose, and by this means was enabled to clear it at once of its disorderly and dirty occupiers. It has been thorougly repaired, and, in consequence, is occupied now by respectable people. Tom's-court, Nos. 2, 6, and 7. The owners were respectively summoned for letting kitchens contrary to the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, section 103, which enacts that no room, the floor of which is more than 3 feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, shall continue to be let or occupied separately as a dwelling unless it have "an area not less than 3 ft. wide in every part, from 6 in. below the floor of such room or cellar to the surface or level of the ground adjoining to the front, back, or external side thereof, and extending the full length of such side;" and unless "such area, to the extent of at least 5 ft. long, and 2 ft. 6 in. wide, be in front of the window of such room or cellar, and be open or covered only with open iron gratings." The area of No. 2 does not extend along the whole of the front, but is only 4 ft. 9 in. long, 2 ft. wide, and 5 ft. 6 in. deep in front of the window. That of No. 6, is 3 ft. 9 in. long, by 1 ft. 9 in. wide. That of No. 7, is 5 ft. 6 in. long, by 2 ft. 1 in. wide. The summonses came off on 5th March; and in each case, the magistrate ordered the kitchen to be disused as a habitation, and the defendants to pay the costs (2s.). It may be observed that the kitchens are intrinsically unhealthy, as well as illegal, else they would not have been interfered with. 10 Market-street, May-fair, No 12. This is a house through which passed all the drainage of No. 44, Curzonstreet, and of one closet in the yard of No. 45, Curzonstreet behind it, as well as the drainage of No. 11, Market-street, adjoining. Besides this, the rainwater from the roofs of Nos. 44, 45, and 46, Curzon-street, and from the back of No. 11, Market-street, passed through it. All this drainage and sewage seem formerly to have been received into a cesspool in the back yard of No. 12, Market-street, with an overflow drain through the house into a sewer in Shepherd's-market. Afterwards, the cesspool seems to have been very imperfectly filled up, and a sort of drain made along the top of it, with a wooden cover. This had now decayed, and fallen in, and obstructed the drain, so that the back yard of No. 45 Curzon-street, and the area and kitchen of No. 12, Market-street, were flooded. Hereupon, complaint was made by the owner of No. 45, Curzon-street, and attended to by Mr. Grant, the Inspector, who recommended that the rotten saturated earth in the cesspool, and the old brick drain in the yard, should be removed, the place filled in with dry rubbish, and a new pipe drain be laid down. It was agreed by the various parties that this should be done at their joint expense, or rather at the expense of all the parties except the owner of No. 12. The last named owner suddenly, however, changed his mind, refused admission to the workmen, and threatened to cut off the watercourse of the three houses which passed through his yard. Hereupon, as a serious nuisance existed, and was continuing, a Special Meeting of the Sanitary Committee was summoned for 5th March, when, after hearing the various parties who attended, the Committee ordered the owner of No. 12 to be summoned if he 11 did not abate the nuisance in three days. On March 9th, the three full days had expired, and nothing was done, therefore a summons was taken out, and the case heard at Marlborough-street on March 14th, when the magistrate granted an order that the work required should be done in seven days. This order was obeyed, and the work done as originally desired by Mr. Grant. Drainage Cases. Mount Street, No. 97. This house was inspected in consequence of the illness and defective drainage at No. 96. (See Report No. XIII. p. 9.) A common privy and set of dilapidated brick drains were discovered, which, under Mr. Grant's directions were abolished and replaced by new water-closet and pipe drains. Maddox-street, No. 8. The owner complained of most offensive smell of gas, especially at night. Mr. Grant found no smell of coal gas, but the offensive effluvia of old brick drains, an untrapped sink, and old disused watercloset with no water, and other defective arrangements. New pipes were laid down, and proper closets constructed. Gilbert-street, No. 35. In the kitchen of this house a child died, and the death was publicly attributed to foul air from the drains. The drains were good, though not trapped, but the wall was undermined with rats, and effluvia travelled by the same channels. The necessary repairs effected. John's-court, Farm-street, No. 4. Attention was directed to this house in consequence of a death from scarlet fever. The ground floor very damp; floor taken up, earth removed, and lime thrown down. Soon afterwards, complaint made by the occupier of 12 No. 9 John Street, of a leakage of offensive water and sewage into the basement, led to an exploration of the drains of this thickly populated court with the following result. The drains in the court are of pipe, but they pass through the cellar of the "Punch Bowl" public house, where was found a large cesspool, and an old brick drain, thoroughly rotten and undermined by rats. This was obstructed, and so the drainage of the court above was impossible. The whole of the cesspool, old drains, and saturated earth around was removed and replaced by lime and dry rubbish, new pipes laid down, inlets thoroughly trapped, &c. Market-street-mews, May-fair No. 12. There is no sewer in this mews, therefore the drainage of this stable passes successively through Nos. 13a, 14, and 15, into Carrington-mews. This had become obstructed, and nuisance ensued. South Audley-street, No. 35. Drains obstructed, causing serious nuisance in show rooms. New pipes laid down, and saturated earth removed. Mount-street, No. 10. No trap between lower drain and sewer, and water closet offensive for want of water. Park-lane, No. 26. The owner made complaint of offensive effluvia in his own house, which the Inspector attributed to the defective state of his own pipes. Brook-street, No. 69. The owner complained of offensive smells, which the Inspector traced to defective drainage and ventilation in complainant's own house. Clarges-street, No. 30a. Complaint by the occupier of obstructed drains. Park-street, No. 101. Offensive smells in parlours, from decayed state of drains in No. 100, adjoining. Little Grrosvenor-street, No. 17. This is a most densely 13 populated house, and a sickly one, as may be seen from the sickness returns. The Medical Officer of Health was extremely desirous of lessening the number of occupants, and proposed that two small rooms in the yard, each about 10 ft. 6 in. by 8 ft. 7 in. and 7 ft. 2 in. high, closely shut in from all fresh air, and overhanging the washhouse and water-closet, should be disused as dwellings. A sub-committee of the Sanitary Committee visited them, and concurred; but the owner was unwilling to do so (although he executed some other improvements, and caused the place to be kept clean), and it appeared doubtful if the Committee had power to compel him. Bloomjield-place, No. 27. Drainage obstructed; saturated earth, &c., removed, and drain repaired. Upper Grosvenor-street, No. 14. Complaint made to the Medical Officer of Health, that the housekeeper's room was offensive from defective drains. The Inspector opened and found them decayed, and they were repaired. The complaint was made by a relative of one of the servants. Old Bond-street, No. 2. Complaint was here made of nuisance from bad drainage. It was found that the drainage of Nos. 1 and 2, Stanbrook-court, and of Nos. 52 and 53, Piccadilly, passed through the complainant's house into the sewer in Old Bond-street, by means of an old brick drain. This was removed, earth taken away and filled in with lime, and new pipes laid down. Green-street, Park-lane, No. 5. Common privy in back yard, and most offensive odours in parlours. New watercloset erected. Green-street, No. 6. Drainage throughout old, rotten, and offensive. It has been replaced by pipes, and made good. 14 "Old Chesterfield Arms," Public House.—Drains choked. Complaint made against an old sewer running under house; but without foundation. Davies-street, No. 13. Nuisance caused here from dilapidated closet at No. 11. All the above cases remedied. John-street, Grosvenor-mews, No. 7. Drain in front area broken in; no water to closet; nor cover to dust-pit. Not yet remedied. Leakages. South-street, No. 9. The owner complained of a leakage into his kitchen from No. 11, adjoining. Mr. Grant inspected and found it proceeded from the foundation, and not as was alleged. G-ilbert-street, No. 36. Great leakage of water; alleged to have come from some house in Thomas-street, but found by Inspector to come from No. 35, Gilbert-street. Remedied. Thomas-street, Nos. 7 and 8. The yards and areas of these houses were damp by the same cause; and by a defective water-pipe at No. 7. Chapel-street, East, No. 10. Leakage into front area from some drain in the street. Remedied.

It became not only deficient in illuminating power, but so loaded with sulphuretted hydrogen, that lead test-paper was completely blackened when applied to the burners, and offensive effuvia, like those from sewers, pervaded different houses. He visited the Company's Works at Vauxhall, where the gas from the wet lime purifier was equally impure, but the common gas presented no traces of sulphuretted hydrogen. The subject having been referred to the Yestry, Mr. Watson, the Engineer of the Company, admitted in a letter that the impurity was caused by the severe weather, the outlet or discharge pipes of the purifier being stopped. The result of the sulphur determinations will be found in the Appendix. 23 TABLE OF MILK ANALYSIS. No. Addresses. Date. Quantity. Specific gravity. Cream.

In each case a "pennyworth of the best milk" was asked for. Nine of the samples contained more water than milk, and one of them would be best described as coloured water, with a little milk in it. The vendors were cautioned, and a promise was made that their names should not be published this time. Be it observed that the worst milk was sold in shops in mews frequented by the poor. The majority of the samples were fair enough.

This Report, with that which precedes and that which follows it, have been delayed in the hope that we should be able to embody in them some minute particulars respecting the population, which we expected to get from documents relative to the Census, promised by the Registrar-General, and which would have been of great value for sanitary and charitable purposes. In this, however, we are disappointed. We may state, however, (since a knowledge of the population is the only correct basis of all questions of sickness and mortality,) that the population of the whole parish has increased from 73,205 at the census of 1851, to 87,747 in 1861. The proportion of women to men is as nearly as possible 4 to 3. The movement of the population has, however, been unequal; the Hanover Sub-district has decreased from 20,219 to 19,770, involving a loss of about 500; the May Fair is stationary ; the Belgrave has gained 15,000. Regarding the loss of 500 in the Hanover Sub-district, it appears that the "Enumeration Districts" of the census, which on the whole shew the greatest decrease, consist of the wealthiest houses and the mews: (for example, the north side of Upper Brook-street, north side of Grosvenorsquare, and west-side of Duke-street, contained only 538 in 1861, instead of 645 in 1851.) That some of the poorer districts shew a decrease, owing to the shutting up kitchens, 25 &c,: (for example, Hart-street, Queen-street and Brownstreet, have fallen from 975 to 904;) but that others shew increase: (for example, Gilbert-street and Robert-street from 1103 to 1152, and Grosvenor-mews from 944 to 1125; —and that whilst the whole decrease is in great measure attributable to the Easter Holidays, and the temporary absence of the letter classes and their servants, there is every reason to believe that there is no material decrease in that part of the population which is the chief object of care of the clergy, the parochial officers, and the medical officers of health, viz.—the stationary mechanic and labouring class. Births. The number in the whole parish was 2,119. In the years ending April 1858, 1859, and 1860 respectively, the numbers were 2,165, 2,228, and 2,300. In the Hanover and May Fair Sub-Districts 656 births against 660, 705, and 710, in the preceding three years successively. In the Belgrave 1,463 against 1,505, 1,583, and 1,590 in the preceding three years respectively. Deaths. Gross number of deaths 1,769, against l,768, 1838, and 1837, in the foregoing three years respectively. The Gross Death-rate, if we estimate the population, in 1860, at 87,500, was 20.2 per 1,000 living. District Mortality. Deaths of non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital 263; of parishioners 67, of whom 27 came from Hanover and May Fair, and 40 from Belgravia. In Mount-street Workhouse, 96 against 88, 75, and 72. In Little Chelsea 25 against 41, 33, and 28. If the deaths of our parishioners (67) in St. George's Hospital, in Mount-street, and Little Chelsea Workhouse (121), be compared with the total deaths, 1769, it will be seen that one in nine dies in a bed provided by charity, even supposing that none die in hospitals out of the Parish. 26 The deaths in the Serpentine during the year have been 3. In Hyde Park 7 persons, including 4 infants have been found dead. In the Hanover and May Fair Sub-Districts the gross total mortality during the year ended 30th March, 1861, has been 534, including the 96 deaths in the Mountstreet Workhouse, 3 in the Serpentine, and 7 in the Park. In the preceding four years, the numbers were respectively 560, 605, 543, and 567. And the deaths this year were at the rate of 16.2 per 1,000 of the population, (32,648,) as determined by the late census. But in order to be more exact, we divide the streets of the Hanover and May Fair Sub-Districts into two classes : First, the aristocratic and first-class business streets, such as Albemarle, Arlington, N. and S. Audley, Bond, Bolton,and Brook streets, Berkeleyand Grosvenor squares, &c. The population of these is very fluctuating, because the inhabitants frequently visit the country, and many of the houses are not occupied more than half the year. The deaths at home in these streets during the past year were 187; in the preceding four years respectively, they were 216, 209, 192, 201. Estimating the population of the streets in round numbers at 20,000, the death rate has been 10.8, 10.45, 9.4, 10.05, and 9.2 deaths per annum, out of every 1,000 living. One-third of these deaths under 5 years of age. Secondly, taking the second and third rate business streets, the mews, and the dwellings of the artizan population (such as Adam's-mews, Avery-row, Bruton-mews, Bell-yard, &c., &c.,) the population may still in round numbers be estimated at 13,000. It is a population, a large part of which resorts to charity for medical attendance and comforts in sickness, which is stationary, and enjoys 27 little change of air; and whose breathing space at night is too often utterly inadequate. The deaths at home amongst this class of our fellow parishioners in these streets during the past year were 241, or at the rate of 18.5 per 1,000 per annum. One half under 5. During the preceding four years they were 251, 293, 269, and 279 respectively, or at the rate of 19.3, 22.4, 20.3, and 21.46 per 1,000 living per annum. This is exclusive of the deaths in hospitals and workhouses. To this comparative statement, we venture to call attention, inasmuch as it shews the fallacy of all broad and unsifted statements as to mortality, and shews that in our own parish, the mortality of the inhabitants of the artizan class, and the conditions which lead to mortality, are widely different from those of the upper classes. Mortality of Belgravia. The deaths at home, (i.e. exclusive of deaths in workhouses and hospitals) in the present year were 880; against 813 in the year ending March 31, 1858; 948 in 1859; and 926 in 1860. The gross rate of mortality (i.e. taking in the whole deaths in St. George's Hospital) was 21.9 per 1000 living. Causes of Death. The deaths from zymotic disease this year have been 291, last year 346; from small-pox 6, last year 8 ; from scarlatina, diphtheria, and other forms of fever, with throat disease, 53; against 109, 75, and 82 in the preceding years respectively; from fevers 39, against 59, 57, and 44; from diarrhœa, dysentery, and cholera 34, against 76, 48, and 83; from teething, convulsions, consumption, water in the head, mesenteric disease, and scrofula 334, against 346, 395, and 353 in the last three years. The Infantile Mortality, that truest test of the physical stamina, morals, domestic comforts, well-being, and 28 gious state of any people, has, as regards our parish, been attacked openly as excessive.* (See the Transactions of the Social Science Association for 1860, p. 64.) In the year ended April 1, 1859, the deaths of infants under one year were 334 out of 2,288 births and 1838 deaths, or about 15.5 per cent. of the births, and about 18 per cent. of the deaths. In the year ended 31st March, 1860, they were 365 out of 2,300 births, and 1,837 deaths; or not quite 16 per cent. of the births, and 20 per cent. of the deaths. In the year just ended they are 295, out of 2,119 births, or not quite 14 per cent. of the births, and about 15.5 per cent. of the deaths. Sickness. Number of cases relieved by Parochial and Dispensary Medical Officers in the Hanover and May-fair Sub-Districts 3,083. Of these, bronchitis and catarrh 475, diarrhoea and dysentery 120, scarlet fever 44, diphtherite 4, fever usually slight 54, measles 37, whooping-cough 36, chicken-pox 9, small-pox 10. In the Belgrave Sub-District, during the year, 2,342 cases were treated by the Parochial Surgeons at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, and the St. Paul and St. Barnabas Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these, 13,320 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 10,112. We find that the whole included 28 of small-pox, 71 of chicken-pox, 212 of measles, 160 of scarlatina, 110 of * "St. George's, Hanover-square, with all its wealth, its splendour, and really English comfort, is only a little less fatal to infants, than Shoreditch, Bermondsey, or Lambeth."—Dr. W. T. Gairdner, loc. cit. He takes his data from the Registrar-General's Reports, 1838—44, he makes the infantile death-rate of our parish eleven times as high as the general death-rate. 29 whooping-cough, 604 diarrhœa, 8 of dysentery, 147 of continued fever, 182 rheumatic fever, 42 of erysipelas, 4 of carbuncle, 1 of pyœmia, 9 of diphtheria, and 21 of ague, 12 of which occurred in non-parishioners. There were also 1,503 cases of bronchitis, 42 of pleurisy, and 83 of pneumonia. The Medical Officer of Health ascertained the existence of 41 cases of scarlet fever. He visited and reported them in the Complaints' Nuisances' Book for the Out-Wards, from September 28th to March 30th inclusive. Thanks are due to Mr. Jorden for his returns of vaccination, and Messrs. W. Griffith, E. Davis, and W. Pain, for their kind assistance in making returns of sickness. Vaccination. During the year ended 31st March, 1861, Mr. Jay, District Vaccinator for the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-districts, vaccinated 258 persons, of which 237 were primary cases, 21 re-vaccinations. Of the whole 251 were successful, 6 of the secondary cases unsuccessful. Out of the primary vaccinated cases, the result is not recorded in 7, because the persons did not come to show themselves, and could not be traced. During the same period, Mr. Jorden vaccinated 750 persons; the numbers in the four consecutive quarters being 228, 206, 176, and 140. Total Vaccination. This year 1,000 against 782, 1,025, and 1,927 in preceding three years. Sanitary Improvement. The number of cases entered and investigated by Mr. Grant, of complaints made by the Medical Officers of Health, the Ratepayers, and the Inspector, was 623, against 425 and 735 in the preceding two years. In the Hanover and May-fair Sub-District 241 cases, 58 notices, 8 cases before magistrate, 3 in which the magistrate made a formal order. 30 In the Belgrave Sub-District 382 cases, 64 notices, 2 cases before magistrate. Magistrate's order, one. The above cases of complaints entered, consist of those only, in which it is necessary to make a formal record of facts, either because the person aggrieved and complaining may think himself otherwise neglected; or because it may be necessary to use those facts as a basis of legal proceedings. They do not include the numberless visits of inspection, and precaution, and watchfulness, which are necessary for the suppression of evils in their bud, but which are not formally entered. For example, there are in the parish— 33 Slaughter Houses, 43 Marine Store Dealers, and 15 Cow Houses. each of which is visited frequently and regularly. In the case of some complaints, it is necessary for the Inspector to make from twelve to thirty visits, to see that the cause of complaint is real, and that the one party is not the victim of frivolous accusation, nor the other of evils which the local authority ought to deal with. We have the honour to be, Your faithful Servants, C. J. B. Alois, M.D. R. Druitt. 31 APPENDIX. Dr. Aldis having been appointed by the Vestry Gas Examiner under the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, on February 21st, 1861, was ordered to report monthly. He had, therefore, six gases to test instead of one as formerly, and performed the experiments in the rooms provided by the Chartered Company, at No. 4, Cannon-row, Westminster; by the London at No. 73, Bessborough-street; and by the Equitable at No. 78, Cambridge-street. Each room contained a photometer, with other necessary apparatus, for taking the illuminating power of the gas. Sulphur Determinations. The result of the sulphur determinations mentioned in a report to the Vestry dated February 21 st, 1861, is, that a quantitative analysis for sulphur in the cannel gas supplied by the London Company on January 14th, 15th, and 17th, produced 16.51, 17.54, and 5.2 grains respectively in 100 cubic feet, the Act allowing 20 grains of sulphur. But it must be remembered that sulphur in the form of sulphuretted hydrogen produces a much more deleterious effect than that of the bisulphide of carbon. This is the first time that sulphuretted hydrogen had been detected, and its presence was attributed to an accident. 32 Extract from the Report to the Vestry. During March, thirty-five observations were made on the illuminating power and quality of the gas supplied by the preceding companies. The cannel gas was burned in a batswing burner at the rate of five cubic feet an hour, while the common gas was consumed in an Argand burner at the same rate, with a seven-inch chimney, according to the Act. The monthly average light in sperm candles was above that required by the Metropolis Gas Act, as will be seen by the following table. Chartered. London. Equitable. Cannel 27.54 22.7 22.9 Common 13.62 14.57 15.36 With respect to the purity, all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and those supplied by the Chartered and Equitable Companies were so far free from ammonia, that they did not discolour turmeric paper; but the common gas from the London Company presented traces of it. A table was annexed to the report, containing the number of examinations on which it was founded, with the maximum, minimum, weekly, and monthly average illuminating power, and the dates of the experiments.

LONDON; PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAQH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. to the Vestry of St. George, Hanober Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, I. We feel glad to report a decrease of 39 deaths in the present quarter, when compared with that of the corresponding period of last year. The total mortality which amounts to 411, includes 2 deaths in the Little Chelsea Workhouse, and 59 of non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital. The weekly average 30.87 is less than that of the preceding ten years by 3.73. During the quarter 1 fatal case of small-pox occurred in a man aged 34, at No. 8, Wilton-street, Belgravesquare. Twelve deaths from measles happened respectively at Nos. 8 and 27, Cock-yard, Davies-street, No. 1, Gilbertstreet, Grosvenor-square, Nos. 20 and 24, George-street, No. 30, Thomas-street, No. 11, Gilbert-street, No. 5, St. Leonard-street, No. l,Clifford's-row, No. 3, Wilton-terrace, and 2 at No. 13, Rutland-street. Scarlet fever was fatal at No. 75, Tachbrook-street, No. 24, Grosvenor-row, No. 6, Eaton-cottages, No. 30, Stockbridge-terrace, and Chapel House, Little Charlotte-street. A boy who came ill from the country died of diphtheria at No. 6, Charlesstreet, Grosvenor-square. Five deaths from diarrhoea occurred, viz.,at No. 43,Dover-street, No.66,Hanover-street, 4 No. 6, Moreton-street West, No. 1, Kempe's-row, and No. 61, Charlwood-street. Among the violent deaths we notice two from burns, one in a child aged 6 years, her clothes having been ignited by a spark from a wood fire, and the second in a girl aged 5 years, whose body was burnt by her clothes igniting from a fire in the grate, at No. 4, John's-court, Berkeley-square. A female aged 32, who resided at No. 3, Upper Eaton-street, was poisoned by prussic acid, but it could not be ascertained how or by whom it was administered. Two persons, a man and woman, aged respectively 44 and 36, were drowned by accident in the river Thames, Thames Bank; and there were three suicides in adults, aged 36, 48, and 55, when insane; two wounded themselves with razors, one at No. 6, Shepherd's-market, and the other at St. George's Workhouse, Mount-street, and the third died from strangulation. A child, aged 14 days, died from natural causes. Sickness. In the Hanover and May Fair Sub-Districts, the number of persons treated gratuitously by the Parochial and Dispensary Medical Officers, was 883. Amongst the cases were 1 of chicken pox; 23 of measles; scarlatina 1; whooping cough 21; diarrhœa 23; ague 1; continued fever 10; erysipelas 2; bronchitis and catarrh 152; diphtherite 1. The houses in which noticeable illness prevailed, were Robert-street, No. 1, measles; No. 5, diphtheria; No. 17, fever; No. 18, diarrhoea; No. 18a and 26, fever: Brownstreet., No. 16, fever: North Bruton-mews, No. 18½, scabies: Brick-street, No. 19, diarrhœa and erysipelas: Avery-row, 13a, fever: George-street, Nos. 15 and 22, diarrhœa; No. 5 10, ague, in a stranger: Tom's-court, No. 7, fever: John'scourt, No. 3, diarrhœa: Gilbert-street. No. 7, diarrhœa. In the Belgrave Sub-District 6,406 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul's and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these 3,586 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 2,820. We find that the total included 22 of chicken pox: 27 of measles; 19 of scarlatina; 40 of whooping cough; 125 of diarrhoea; 5 of dysentery; 38 of continued fever: 61 of rheumatic fever; 3 of diphtheria; 9 of erysipelas; 1 of carbuncle; and 3 of ague, which occurred in nonparishioners. There were 340 cases of bronchitis, 12 of pleurisy, and 20 of pneumonia. ABRIDGED ACCOUNT OF NUISANCES DEALT WITH IN THE HANOVER & MAY-FAIR SUB-DISTRICTS. Drainage Cases. Shepherds-market, Nos. 16, 17, 18, and 19. Here is a case of combined drainage. These houses discharge their sewage by one drain, which had become obstructed at No. 18. After examination it was repaired, being of good construction, and allowed to remain. Brown-street, No. 16. A similar case. The drain of No. 3, George-yard passes through this house, and became obstructed, creating a nuisance. We induced the owner to shut up the kitchen, as unfit for human habitation. (See Report, No. IX., p. 17.) 6 Curzon-street, No. 43. An offensive common privy in front vault, and decayed drains leaking into No. 44. Park-street, No. 26. A stoppage of drains occasioned by the carelessness of occupiers. Remedied by Inspector. South-street, No. 4. In December 1856, and January 1857, complaints were investigated respecting the drains of this house. By the side of the house is a passage, leading to North-terrace. The cellar of No. 4, Southstreet runs under this passage, and under the cellar runs a drain; taking the drainage of the four houses and of a gully in North-terrace, and of No. 4, South-street, to join the sewer in South-street. At that time the Committee of Works thought the owner of No. 4 South-street liable for the repairs of this drain, and recommended him to repair it, and no further steps were taken. Now, in May 1861, fresh complaints were made by the occupier; the condition of things was reported by the Medical Officers of Health to be very unwholesome and demand remedy, and after much investigation of an intricate question of rights, the Committee of Works did the repairs at the parish expense. "Greyhound" Public House, Brick-street. Two cases of severe choleraic diarrhoea, early in June. Complaints of effluvia entering back windows. Mr. Grant procured a cleansing of offensive closets in yard. Mount-street, No. 8. Leakage into basement, from defective drain of No. 9. South Bruton-mews, No. 6. Wine-merchant's vaults underneath, damaged by defective state of drains above. Brown-street, No. 9. Drains imperfect. House to undergo thorough repair. Robert-street, No. 17. Fever. Offensive effluvia from decayed closet. New closet and lime-whiting. 7 Davies-mews, No. 14. Stable, inhabited by man, wife, and 5 children. No water-closet; nuisances created in the Mews. A dispute as to which of several lessors and sub-tenants was liable. Case heard at Marlborough-street, 31st May; adjourned to 13th June, when magistrate required the owner, i. e. the present lessee, either to provide proper water-closet, or to disuse the place as habitation. Avery-row, No. 13a. Child ill with diphtheria; untrapped sink in the room. Offensive G-ullies have been trapped in Street's-buildings; 1 near 38, South Audley-street, and 1 in Chapelmews, Robert-street. The corner of Duke-street, Grosvenor-square. There was some delay in this case, because it belongs to the Parish of St. Mary-le-bone. The old Sewer underneath Little Bruton-street. The effluvia which escaped whilst this sewer was open for partial repair during the hot weather in June, were a source of no small danger to the inhabitants, and of anxiety to us. It is well to put in record the fact, that can be vouched for, of the speedy decomposition of fresh meat when exposed to these effluvia, at the butcher's shop in the street, and the tarnishing of polished metal work at Mr. Glenton's. It is earnestly to be desired that this old sewer may be replaced by one which admits of no accumulations. Dangerous Structures referred to Police. Party-wall between 12 and 13, Lancashire-court, very dangerous. "Castle" Public House, Shepherd's-court, Upper Brookstreet. 8 Kitchens Closed. Hanover-place, No. 2. Inhabited by widow and 7 children.

WATER. Dr. Aldis directed the notice of the Committee to a letter which had appeared in the Daily Telegraph of March 26th, calling the attention of the water-drinkers of Chelsea to the fact, that the parishioners of Walton-on-Thames were going to add a new burial ground to the churchyard, and to drain through the old yard into the Thames. For more than 800 years the old yard has been used for interments, and the ground has been turned over and over so many times, that there can be but little earth remaining, which is not filled up with remains. It is further remarked, that if every parish along the banks of 17 the Thames is permitted to drain their graveyards into the river, what a polluted stream will flow into London cisterns. Dr. Aldis wrote to Mr. James Simpson upon the subject, who replied on April 9th, that he was looking closely after the movement, and had no doubt that, with the assistance of the Thames Conservators, he should be able to prevent the drainage into the river. An analysis of the water supplied by the Chelsea Company, and taken April 17th, 1861, from the main at Chapel-street, Belgrave-square, produced— Total Impurity 20.64 Organic Ditto 1.88 May 17, 1861.

Dkuitt. 18 APPENDIX. One hundred and thirty-two observations were made during the quarter upon the gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the works in Horseferry-road, 73, Bessborough-street, and 78, Cambridge-street, respectively. The apparatus provided by the Chartered Company having been so much damaged, in consequence of a fire in Cannon-row, Westminster, the gas was tested at the works. The cannel gas was burned in a batswing burner at the rata of 5 cubic feet an hour, while the common gas was consumed in an argand burner at the same rate with a 7-inch chimney, in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act 1860. The following table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases, which were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia, that they did not discolour turmeric paper, excepting the common gas from the London Company, which presented traces of it. Chartered. London. Equitable. Cannel 24.80 25,34 24 Comon 14;10 15.05 15.64 A table and summary were sent with each monthly report on the gas to the vestry, containing the number of examinations with the dates, and the maximum and minimum light, with the weekly and monthly average illuminating power. 19 Naphthalized Gas. I also reported upon the subject of a letter, dated April 24, 1861, from the United Kingdom Carburating Gas Company, which directed your attention to a patented invention for carburating gas for street lamps, and for lighting public and private buildings, whereby at a very small cost a considerable saving is effected. I made experiments during three weeks upon the increase of illuminating power of the naphthalized gas, and the quantity of material consumed. The process consists in passing common gas through a chamber containing naphtha, with which the gas, having come into contact, mechanically combines with the volatile vapours, and produces a greatly increased light. This method is termed naphthalizing gas, for which a patent was taken out by Professor Donovan, 6th October, 1830, who applied naphtha to hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and the gases produced by decomposing water by coke. Mr. George Lowe received a patent June 9th, 1832, which has expired, for naphthalizing coal gas, and French patents have been taken out for the same purpose. But the principle of applying naphtha to street lamps, and the mode adopted by the company, is new in this country. The company intend to apply the carburator inside the lantern, below the burner, in order to keep an equable temperature. In one experiment, the illuminating power of the common gas, when naphthalized, was nearly double, and in another it became two and a quarter times greater than the non-carburetted. 20 During a series of experiments on the quantity of naphtha consumed, I found that it varied considerably, but the average amounted to 10.9 grains per cubic foot of gas. Assuming, then, 11 grains of naphtha to be consumed per foot, the quantity burnt annually would be rather more than two gallons, at 3s. a gallon. The apparatus is applicable to street lamps, and the preceding experiments show, that the brilliancy of inferior gas is increased, and the consumption economized, by the addition of naphtha. In St. George's Parish the question of cost must be compared with cannel and not with common gas, the parish lamps being supplied with the former. I could not, on that account, and for other reasons mentioned in the Report, recommend the Vestry to make any alteration. (Signed) C. J. B. Alms, M.D. TABLE OF MORTALITY.

LONDON: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER EANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. To THE Vestry of St.George Hanover Square Mr Lords and Gentlemen, The table annexed to this report shows that during the 13 weeks ended 28th September, 1861, the number of deaths in our Parish was 410. As this number includes 12 deaths in the Little Chelsea Workhouse, the real number 398 is very slightly in excess of the average of the last ten years. It will be seen besides that it includes 47 deaths of non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital. It is worth noticing that during the third Quarter of the year the excess of deaths in our Parish over 370, depends mainly on the number of deaths of children from diarrhoea and its allied disorders. Thus during the third Quarters of the last five years the deaths have respectively been— Deaths. Deaths from Diarrhoea. Remainder. 1857 3rd qr. 424 64 360 1858 „ 412 35 377 1859 „ 440 62 378 1860 „ 380 17 363 1861 „ 410 36 374 It will further be seen from the table that the 36 victims of bowel disorders were with 2 exceptions children; and we cannot fail to be struck with the great and disproportionate number of children's deaths; for be it observed that in the present Quarter the deaths of children under 5 exceed one-half of the total mortality, 4 and for every 5 born in the Parish 1 infant has died. No matter what the disease be, if the mortality from it be high, the victims will be children of the working classes. We repeatedly bring this matter forward from the conviction that it is hopeless to expect much improvement unless the moral tone of the people be raised. The 9 infants who died of want of breast-milk and the 28 who died of diarrhoea were sacrificed through poverty and mismanagement, which we have no power to counteract. Measles proved fatal in eight cases, 1 of them that of a woman of 70, scarlatina in 16, diphtherite in 3, and typhus in 6, 14 children died of water in the head, 10 of convulsions, 8 of teething and 12 of atrophy and debility. We generally notice the accidental deaths as they are sure to have a moral. A child of one year was scalded by a bason of bread-and-milk, which he pulled over himself from a table; a lady was burned by her sleeve catching fire from a candle; and a child was scalded by falling into a tub of hot water on the floor. Moreover, two dead infants were found in the streets. The mortality from scarlatina was constantly on the increase during the Quarter. There were 2 deaths in July, 6 in August, and 8 in September. An account of the houses in which the deaths happened and of the measures adopted in consequence was laid before the Sanitary Committee. In the Hanover and May-fair Sub-Districts the quantity of sickness was great, for 999 persons were entered as patients by the Parochial and Dispensary Medical Officers. Amongst them three were affected with well marked Asiatic cholera, happily not fatal. There were 271 cases of diarrhoea, and only 64 of catarrh. Of the diarrhoea patients one-half were applicants for casual 5 relief at the Dispensary in Mount-street. There were 2 cases of chicken-pox, 7 of measles, 29 of scarlet fever, 3 of whooping-cough, 33 of continued fever, and 1 of diphtherite. The scarlet fever began in Grosvenor-mews in the middle of August, it soon spread to Shepherd'smarket, John's-court, Hertford-place, and Hanover-place. It must be added that several of the 33 cases entered as continued fever were ill-developed cases of scarlet fever, and that there has been an unusual prevalence of sore throat, which doubtless was a lesser effect of the same poison. In the Belgrave Sub-District 6,801 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul's and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse Little Chelsea. Of these 3,609 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 3,192, a large proportion of whom are supposed to be inhabitants of the Parish. We find that the total number included 14 cases of scarlet fever, 3 of cholera, 10 of chicken-pox, 35 of measles, 13 of whooping-cough, 833 of diarrhoea, 1 of dysentery, 43 of continued fever, 31 of rheumatic fever, 1 of diphtheria, 16 of erysipelas, 2 of carbuncle, and 1 of small-pox. There were 198 cases of bronchitis, 9 of pleurisy, and 9 of pneumonia. We have the honour to be, Your faithful Servants, C. J. B. Aldis, M.D. R. Dbuitt. 6 APPENDIX. No. I. water.

Complaint of unwholesome effluvia from the preparation of vulcanite. The occupiers of No. 50, Maddox-street, complained of a nuisance caused by a dentist living at the next house, No. 52, in the preparation of vulcanite— a material of which artificial gums and palates are made. On inspecting the process of manufacture, and from inquiry made of other dentists, it soon became evident that the complaint was well founded. The material employed (probably sulphur and some preparation of india rubber) is put in a soft state into a plaster mould, which is screwed safely into an iron box, and then baked in an iron vessel by means of steam at a high pressure. The iron vessel enclosed in a jacket is heated by a gas lamp till it attains the heat of 300° or 350°. There is a safety valve to prevent explosion which was said never to be lifted by 8 the pressure within; but when the operation is finished the steam is let off with an explosion, which may be very alarming, and with an escape of sulphureous vapour which is certainly abominably sickening. It appeared therefore that neighbours might reasonably complain of such processes carried on in the area of a house in a London street; and the dentist was requested to take means for preventing the escape of the pernicious vapour, and was instructed in the best process for so doing. There was a repetition of the nuisance, whereupon by direction of the Committee, a letter was written threatening legal proceedings; since which there has been no complaint. Nuisance at Nos. 2 and 3, Hertford-street, May-fair. It will be gathered from former reports, that several investigations were made of a nuisance complained of at No. 2, Hertford-street, May-fair, which was alleged to be caused by a slaughter-house in the rear. It has been discovered however that an enormous cesspool, 9 ft. deep and 6 ft. wide, charged full of soil, existed between Nos. 3 and 4, into which the drains of those houses emptied themselves, with an overflow drain through a stable, No. 2, Ducking-pond-mews. A rain-water pipe leading into this cesspool from the back of the house brought up the effluvia complained of at No. 2. The cesspool has now been abolished, and pipes laid down. It is well to put on record that there was a severe case of cholera at No. 3 in 1854. Putrid Fat. Proceedings were taken before Mr. Arnold at the Westminster Police Court, in consequence of a quantity of fat which was deposited in the highway of Chapel-place, Chapel-street, Belgrave-square, by a man who wished to sell it to a marine store dealer. But the dealer refused to take it into his house, believing 9 that the material was not worth the money which had been demanded. Meanwhile the fat became so offensive as to require its removal and the Nuisances Removal Committee ordered it to be destroyed; and ordered the seller who had refused to take it away, to be summoned. Pigs. Much time was occupied in reference to a nuisance arising from a number of pigs kept in Unionplace, Chelsea. The complainant who resided at No. 5, Belgrave-cottages, Pimlico, stated that his family and some of the neighbours had suffered severely in health in consequence of the effluvia, and produced a certificate from his medical attendant attributing the illness to this cause. The Committee advised proceedings to be taken, but the complainant, at the instigation of your Medical Officer of Health, who was acting also for Chelsea, reported the case to the vestry of that parish, who referred it to the police. The defendants, upon being summoned, were in many instances compelled to remove the animals, and in others to lessen their number, and to put the sheds into proper repair. APPENDIX. No. IV. GAS. One hundred and thirteen observations were made during the quarter upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the works in Horseferry-road, 73, Bessborough-street, and 78, Cambridge-street respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light, excepting on July 31st, when the common gas supplied by the Chartered 10 pany gave a light equal to 11.90 sperm candles, while the Act requires the intensity of light to be not less than 12 sperm candles. Upon this circumstance being reported to the Board, they stopped a large contract for coals then used for making the common gas, and entered into a new one. With regard to the quality of the gases, they were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia that they did not discolour the turmeric paper exposed under a pressure of five-tenths of an inch of water, exclusive of the common gas from the London Company, which presented traces of it during the first part of the quarter, but only very slight traces in the month of September. The amount of sulphur in the cannel gas from the same Company was considerably diminished,—the result of two determinations, commenced on September 28th, producing only 3.862 and 3.352 grains in each 100 cubic feet of gas. The following Table gives the average light in sprem candles of all the gases. Chartered. London. Equitable. Cannel 25.09 24.58 24.78 Common 13.587 15.22 15.42 A Table and Summary were sent with each Monthly Report on the gas to the Vestry, containing the number of examinations with the dates, and the maximum and minimum light, with the weekly and monthly average illuminating power.

LONDON: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. TO THE Uestrn of St. Grorge, Hanober Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, We are sorry to have to report that the mortality in the parish during the 13 weeks ended December 28, 1861, was unusually high; for no fewer than 535 deaths appear in the Table annexed to this Report. The average number of deaths in the parish during the corresponding quarters of the last ten years has been nearly 400; so that even if we make allowance for the 66 nonparishioners, who have died this quarter in St. George's Hospital, and for the 9 of our parishioners, who have died in the Little Chelsea Workhouse, it will be evident that about 9 persons have died every week of this quarter above the average. When we come to the causes, we find at once that this great mortality is due distinctly to the prevalence of zymotic or epidemic disease. There is some slight increase in the number of deaths from consumption, and from other diseases of debility at all ages; but the main increase is in the number of deaths from zymotic disease. During the last five years the number of deaths per quarter for this class of diseases, has ranged from 47 to 115, the average being 86; during this last quarter the number has been 154, of which 122 were deaths of persons under 20. 4 Of this number, scarlet fever has contributed 58 deaths, diphtheria 10, croup and sore throat 14, whooping-cough 18, and typhus 15. The places where scarlatina chiefly prevailed were Grosvenor-mews, Hertford-place, Grantham-place, Hanover-place, Ebury-street, Hanover-street, and other places inhabited by the working classes, in all parts of the parish. The result of our inquiries was, that in some cases the spread of the infection was greatly facilitated by that neglect of sinks, water-closets, &c., which is at present an almost incurable vice in the lower orders. There were other cases, in which overcrowding of houses required to be abated, and rooms to be cleansed and better ventilated. It is probable too, that the disease was in some cases propagated by the intermixture of children at the schools, and in the waiting rooms of the dispensaries. But the fact remains that we are at present almost powerless in the face of this virulent infection, when it attacks illnourished children in the crowded houses of the poor, and shall continue so until the parties most directly concerned are wakened up to a higher degree of intelligence, so that they may second the efforts made to help them. There was one instance during this epidemic of a young man delirious with fever, whom his friends permitted to get out of bed, and wander about the house in the cold, till he was nearly exhausted. There was the case of a woman who had lost three children with scarlet fever and was nursing a fourth most dangerously ill with the same disease. All that attention and skill, and the lavish administration of medicine, wine, and nourishment could do, was done for her; and she was particularly cautioned as to the necessity of keeping her room well ventilated. But on going to it one evening late a visitor found it 5 filled with adults, smoking, and with the air so hot and close, that a healthy person could scarcely breathe. That fourth child died also. In one case in the Royal-mews, Buckingham Palace, where a child died of diphtheria, the mother could not be persuaded that there was any harm in the escape of foul sewer gases from a neglected trap, in the room where the child slept. Some good might be done, if a parochial nurse could be employed to go round to the poor and assist them in the management of their sick children; or if there were a ward into which sick children could be received. These measures however would not relieve the wants of a whole parish; and we are convinced the time is now come, when one distinct object of education, of sanitary measures, and of benevolent aid must be to teach the poor to help themselves, and not to rely upon others. Even in relation to sanitary measures we meet with people who expect, that the simplest act of precaution shall be done for them, and who will not move a finger for themselves. We always notice such of the accidental deaths, as point to important defects in education or morals. Amongst them will be found in the Table with "causes not specified," those of four infants found in the streets or in Hyde Park. In each case the coroner's jury gave an open verdict on the ground, that it was doubtful, whether they had been born alive or not. We must hesitate, therefore, to designate them as cases of child-murder, although we may remonstrate against the indecency of such a mode of disposing of dead children. A gas fitter was poisoned by gas at No. 20, Mount-street, a child was suffocated when in bed with its mother at No. 1, Bloomfield-place, another child was scalded by hot water thrown over by himself, and a person took a dose of cyanide of potassium in mistake for a black draught. 6 Five persons committed suicide while of unsound mind, a carpenter drowned himself in the river Thames, a gentleman threw himself out of window, the third, a young man, took cyanide of potassium, a carman hung himself by a strap to the door-post of a closet, from insanity produced by intemperance, and a postman hung himself by a rope to a bedstead. The number of patients in the Hanover and May-fair Sub-Districts who received gratuitous medical attendance during the quarter, from the Parochial Surgeons, from the Dispensary, Mount-street., and at the Workhouse, was 924, of whom 4 were affected with small-pox, 5 with chicken-pox, 25 with measles, 55 with scarlatina, 2 with diphtheria, 22 with whooping-cough, 41 with diarrhoea, 24 with continued fever, 174 with bronchitis and catarrh, and 1 with pneumonia. The four cases of small-pox occurred in a family residing in Bloomfield-place. The malady was brought home by one of the sons aged 13, who works in Soho, and it spread to three of his brothers. All had been remarkably well vaccinated in infancy and probably owed their lives to this. The various apartments in Bloomfieldplace were visited, and one child, found not to have been vaccinated, was sent to Mr. Jay to be made safe forthwith. In the Belgrave Sub-District 6529 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul's and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these 3117 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 3412. We find the total number included 15 cases of chickenpox, 48 of scarlet fever, 56 of measles, 75 of whoopingcough, 138 of diarrhoea, I of dysentery, 66 of continued 7 fever, 58 of rheumatic fever, 1 of diphtheria, 17 of erysipelas, 2 of carbuncle, 2 of croup, 1 pyeemia, and 3 of ague. There were 657 cases of bronchitis, 7 of pleurisy, and 35 of pneumonia. We have the honour to be, Your faithful Servants, C. J. B. Aldis, M.D., R. Druitt.a 8 APPENDIX. No. I. WATER.

During the month of October, we formally visited and examined with the Inspector all the slaughter-houses in the parish, in order to report on their condition preparatory to the renewal of their licenses. As the necessity or otherwise of maintaining slaughter-houses has been a matter of controversy, we think it expedient to put the following facts on record. In the In-Wards, the number of licensed slaughter-houses is 14 Four years ago it was 17 In the Out-Wards 20 Four years ago it was 26 9 Not only is the number diminished, but there are in the In-Wards 11 in constant use; one which is only used at rare intervals; and two which have not been used during the last twelvemonth or two years. It is noticeable, that one of these belonged to a butcher, who obstinately contended for the necessity of private slaughterhouses. These facts are important as shewing that the privilege of slaughtering at home is not so much valued as it formerly was. APPENDIX. No. III. FOOD. An examination was made of a dozen specimens of milk purchased at various shops; all of which appeared free from adulteration by water, although all were deficient in cream. A practical lesson was given to the elder girls of the School in South-street respecting the qualities of good milk, when specimens were exhibited and the signs of adulteration pointed out, so that they might learn to protect themselves. A similar examination was made of ten specimens of coffee purchased in different parts of the parish. In every case the purchaser says that he asked to have it pure. Five specimens purchased at chandler's shops in the poorest parts of the parish were quite pure. Four other specimens were mixed with chicory, although the mixture was not denoted by any label as the law directs. One sample of flour was sent for examination by a poor woman, but was found quite good. R. D. 10 APPENDIX. No. IV. SUMMARY OP SANITARY OPERATIONS DURING THE QUARTER. The entire number of cases of Nuisance in the Complainants' Book during the quarter is 133, of which 52 were reported by the Medical Officers of Health, 25 by the Inspector, and 58 by the inhabitants. Houses reported by the Medical Officers of Health, and submitted to careful inspection in consequence of illness 49 Houses reported on account of defective drainage 30 Ditto, want of ventilation 1 Ditto, cesspools 4 Ditto, effluvia 6 Ditto, gullies 3 Ditto, basement flooded with sewage 3 Ditto, on account of overcrowding 1 Ditto, being dirty 11 Ditto, dangerous 1 Ditto, leakage 5 Rubbish removed 3 Dung 4 Cowyards 2 Gas 3 Unwholesome food 1 Urinal 1 Miscellaneous 3 P'gs 1 Slaughter-house 1 We subjoin, as in the last Report, the particulars of a few cases of interest, especially those in which legal proceedings were taken or threatened. Shepherd's-market, No. 2. The owner of this house 11 complained of nuisance from the ventilating shaft of a cowshed behind the house, which opened just opposite her attic windows, and was required to be raised. The owner of the cowshed admitted the nuisance, but denied his liability under his lease to do the required work. A summons was taken out by directions of the Sanitary Committee, in order that the Magistrate might adjudicate upon the case; but before the case came to a hearing, the defendant did what was required, and paid the costs. Cowshed, Providence-court, No. 10. Some rooms over this place were inhabited, but were closed as soon as the Committee ordered a summons to be taken out for the purpose. Hart-street, No. 9. This house was very dirty and dilapidated, and the drains untrapped, and there was great delay in executing the cleansing which the Committee required. A summons was therefore taken out, heard on October 28th, adjourned till November 4th, when the works were executed and the costs paid. A urinal belonging to the Rising Sun Public House in Charles-street, Grosvenor-square, and situated close to the door of No. 11 Adam's-mews, a small house crowded with children, was so habitually offensive, that the Committee ordered the owner either to lay on water so as to keep it sweet, or to close it. He accepted the latter alternative, which he was very glad to do. Wilton-terrace, Belgravia, No. 20. Mr. Gray, surgeon to the Western District Post Office wrote to Dr. Aldis that a man, named James Martin, was suffering from malignant fever, and that his mother refused to submit him to medical treatment or to have him removed to the Hospital. Mr. Gray also stated that he had been attending the patient for two days, and the mother had locked the door refusing to admit anyone. The Controller of the Post Office directed him to report the case to the Medical 12 Officer of Health, who went accompanied by a policeman, and, after great difficulty, obtained admission into the room. He found the man lying on the floor delirious with typhus fever. Wine and medicine were administered and a nurse provided for the night, and Mr. Gray was asked to resume his attendance. The patient recovered and has returned to his employment. Spark's Cottages, Graham-street, West, No. 1. The two following cases are selected out of several instances of scarlet fever, which occurred in the Belgrave SubDistrict. Seven persons were found suffering from scarlet fever in this house. There was no trap to the drain in the wash house, and no ventilation under the floor of the back bed room; the party wall was saturated with urine by men employed in the adjoining saw mills. The drains in the wash house have been trapped and the floors ventilated; the wall has been cleansed, the saturated earth removed, and lime thrown down. No. 2, also, underwent the same sanitary improvement. Hart's-buildings, Westbourne-street, No. 3. A death from scarlet fever having occurred here, the Medical Officer of Health and Inspector visited the spot and found the corpse in a room over the closet, the effluvium from which could enter it. At No. 1, in the same Buildings, the staircase, wash house, and yard were dirty; no water to the privy; paving in the yard out of repair, and no cover to the water butt. At No. 2, the same nuisances existed. No. 8 was dirty and dilapidated throughout, the paving in the yard of the Buildings out of repair, there was neither dust pit, nor cover to the water tank which joined the privy. This was partly exposed to public view owing to a deficiency in the wall, so that the whole place had become exceedingly unwholesome and indecent. A notice was served and the work is in progress. 13 APPENDIX. No. V. GAS. Ninety nine observations were made during the quarter upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London and Equitable Companies, at the Works in Horseferry-road, 73 Bessborough-street, and 78 Cambridge-street respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light, excepting on November 6, when the cannel gas from the London Company gave a light equal to 19.25, instead of 20 sperm candles, and on the 20th, of the same month, the cannel gas from the Chartered Company gave a light equal to 19.53 sperm candles. With regard to the purity of the gases, they were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia that they did not discolour the turmeric paper exposed under a pressure of five-tenths of an inch of water; but the common gas from the London Company, presented traces of it during the early part of October. It is gratifying to report the absence of ammonia, so far as the Act requires, from the common gas of the London Company during the greater part of the quarter, which may be attributable to the control permitted to be exercised under the Act. The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases. Chartered. London. Equitable. Cannel 23.60 22.15 25.10 Common 14.02 14.78 15.82 A Table and Summary were sent with each monthly report on the gas to the Vestry, containing the number of examinations with the dates, and the maximum, and minimum light with the weekly and monthly average illuminating power.
