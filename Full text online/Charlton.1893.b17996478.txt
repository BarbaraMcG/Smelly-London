Pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, the following is the Report of the proceedings of the Board in the execution of that Act and the statutes amending the same, and of the works commenced and completed respectively in the year ended 25th March. 1894, and the works remaining in progress at the termination of such year, and also of any proceedings taken by the Board in such year for the removal of nuisances or the improvement of the Sanitary condition of the District. Some of such works and proceedings are shown in detail in the 12 reports of the Surveyors and Sanitary Inspectors and other Officers following, There are also annexed hereto copies of the Annual Reports of the Medical Officers of Health, and other tabular statements, including a report (Table A, page 18), showing Population, Number of Houses and Rateable Value in respect of each Parish in the District as compared with last year and with the whole Metropolis. The result of the election of the County Council (March, 1892) is also shown (page 17). 2. The annual report of the Public Analyst for this District is also published herewith. 3. Particulars of prosecutions by the Board for offences are also given in a separate report. 4. The Acts of Parliament under which this Board exercises its various powers in this District of the Metropolis, are chiefly as follows:- The Metropolis Management Acts. 5. The Metropolis Management Act, 1855, 18 and 19 Vic., Cap. 120, is the Act under which the Board was originally constituted and the District defined. The District, then called Plumstead District, included the following parishes, viz.:—Charlton, Eltham, Kibrook, Lee and Plumstead. The Vestries of these Parishes (Plumstead now excepted—see below) elect members to the Board, the vestries being themselves chosen by the rate-payers. The annual election of members to the Board by the Vestries takes place in each Parish on the first Wednesday in the month of June. One third of 13 the members go out of office annually; all the members go out of office on the first Wednesday in June in the third year from their election. The number of members for each Parish is set out in the tabular form at the foot of this report. The members of the Board were hitherto persons rated or assessed to the relief of the poor in the Parish in which they are elected, upon a rateable value of £40, excepting in the Parishes in which the number of poor rate assessments at £40 or upwards does not exceed one-sixth of the whole number of such assessments, in which case the rateable value constituting a qualification was reduced to £25. This lower qualification applied of late years in the Parishes of Plumstead and Charlton. The Local Government Act, 1894, (see special report p. 21) alters the qualification. 6. The principal duties of this District Board under this Act, and the Metropolis Management Amendment Acts, 1862-90, consist in the construction, repair, and cleansing of sewers (except main sewers, which are now vested in the London County Council), the supervision of house drainage, and the execution of the office of Surveyor of Highways, which empowers the Board to repair, pave, light, improve* water, and maintain public ways, and to prevent obstruction there. Paving works and sewers in new streets can also be constructed by the Board at the cost of the owners and occupiers. Much work of this kind has recently been executed. Under these Acts temporary repairs can now be executed by the Board in new streets, and this has been done in several cases. These Acts also empower the Board to proceed against persons building beyond the general line. 14 7. The expenditure of the Board, under these and other Acts hereinafter mentioned, and the contributions of the District to the expenditure of the London School Board, are met by precepts issued by the Board to the Overseers of the various Parishes above mentioned in the District in proportion to the rateable value of property in such Parishes. The rateable value appears from the table set out at the end of this report. The accounts of the Board have to be audited annually by three unpaid auditors chosen by the Board in April, from amongst the Vestry Auditors of the District. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 8. This Act came into operation on the 1st of January, 1892. It is a most important Act and repeals many of the existing provisions of the Metropolis Management and other Acts, and also repeals the Nuisance Removal Act, 1855, and some sections of the later Sanitary Acts and makes new and in some respects different provisions in substitution of the Acts repealed, and also makes additional provisions with regard to Public Health in the County of London. The Act constitutes this Board the "Sanitary Authority" for the District. New provisions are introduced as to the appointment or re-appointment of Medical Officers of Health and Sanitary Inspectors, and as to Polluted Wells, Mortuaries and other matters. Duties are imposed upon the Board as a Sanitary Authority to properly cleanse and sweep Streets, including the footways, and to collect street refuse. All Owners and Occupiers are now exempt from obligation to sweep and cleanse footways. This Act is now 15 in operation, and prosecutions under it have been numerous. The Board has passed and the Local Government Board has approved the necessary bye-laws under this Act. Food and Drugs Acts. 9. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875-9, (38 and 39 Vie., c. 63, and 42 and 43 Vic., c. 30), the Board appoints Inspectors, who obtain samples of food and drugs, which are analysed by the Public Analyst appointed by the Board. The vendors of adulterated articles are prosecuted. 10. There is still a continuing increase in population, houses and streets, and consequently also in the paving and other works, in nuisance cases, and generally in the work and duties of the Board's officers. The report of Police Court proceedings annexed gives particulars of summonses issued. The rateable value of the Plumstead district according to the Valuation List which will come into force on the 6th April next, is £462,519. The annexed Table "A" gives some other figures showing the growth of the district. 11. The Housing of the Working Class Act, 1890, has been very much used in other and more crowded districts, but the houses hero are comparatively new, and are not so closely built. The health of the district stands high, and the Board after enquiry has not found it necessary to take any proceedings under this Act. 16 Plomstead Separation. 12. By the "Metropolis Management Plumstead and Hackney Act, 1893," the Parish of Plumstead was separated from the other parishes, as from 25th March, 1894; and the parishes of Charlton, Eltham, Lee and Kidbrook, constitute the Lee District. The Act provides for the apportionment of assets and liabilities, and other incidental matters. Three of the clerks in the office, (Charlton) and the parochial officers, have been transferred to Plumstead Vestry under this Act. The Board continues to meet at Charlton, but at 7 p.m. instead of G-30 p.m. GEORGE WHALE, Cleric. Old Charlton, 25th March, 1894. NOTE. The Local Government Act, 1894.

GEORGE WHALE, 25th March, 1897 Clerk The Local Government Act, 1894. Report of Mr. George Whale, Clerk and Solicitor to the Board of Works for the Lee District on the effect of the Act upon the constitution and powers of District Boards in the administrative County of London. 30 th May, 1894. 1. The Local Government Act, 1894, affects the constitution and powers of District Boards. It repeals some sections of the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855, 1856, and 1862, substitutes other provisions in lieu thereof, and enables some additional powers to be conferred on District Boards. It also deals with matters affecting the Vestries within the London Districts. But the provisions as to London are scattered amongst the eighty nine sections of this Act. Their full effect cannot be ascertained until further orders or rules are made by the Local Government Board; and even then, there must remain some difficult questions of law under this very complicated Statute My report is limited to the particular provisions of this new Act which directly apply to or affect London District Boards. The chief of these alterations are as follows:- B 22 Membeks. 2. The qualification of Members of District Boards has hitherto been by rating (£40 or £25, as the case might be) and occupation (M.M.A. 1855, s. 6, 1856, s. s. 6-8, 1862, s. 40). Most of these Sections are now repealed and the others much altered. One third of the Members of District Boards will still retire annually. The election of Members of District Boards in the place of Members so retiring will still be held by the Vestries specified in the Metropolis Management Act, 1855 (Schedule B) as amended by later Acts, on the first Wednesday in the month of June. Such Yestries will also continue to fill up casual vacancies. But the qualification of Members of District Boards will now be that mentioned in Sec. 31 of the Local Government Act, 1894. (See paragraph 3). 3. The only persons, therefore, whom the Yestries can now elect as Members of District Boards are "parochial electors" of some parish within the district, or residents who have, during the whole twelve months preceding the election, resided in the District. No person shall be disqualified by sex or marriage from being elected. "Parochial Elector" practically means a person whose name appears either in the "Local Government Register" or "Parliamentary Register" of Electors relating to the parishes within the districts (L.G.A., 1894, s. s. 31 (1) 75 (2), 23 (2), 2 (1), 44). Upon the first only of the elections (6th June, 1894) under this new Act, the Vestries may (if the "appointed day" s.s. 84-89, means 6th June, 1894) be perplexed by the want of the proper register of electors. No doubt their legal advisers will be consulted. The alternative qualification (by residence for twelve months) would then prove useful; but it, in turn, leads to legal questions as to what is a sufficient "residence." This however is also primarily at least a question only for the Vestries. 23 4. It is, however, material to notice that the 54th section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, imposing certain disqualifications on Members of District Boards (e.g., on those interested in contracts with such Boards) and certain penalties on persons who act as members when disqualified is repealed (L.G.A., 1894, s. 89 and Schedule II.). The new Act contains elaborate provisions (Sec. 46) as to disqualification. These apply to Members and Auditors of London Vestries, but it is not at all clear that euch provisions apply to Members of District Boards. Chairman. 5. District Boards will cease to elect a Chairman at every meeting;. They must, at their first meeting after the annual election of members, elect a "Chairman for the year." Only in his absence will it be necessary to electa Chairman for a meeting. The "Chairman for the year" will not have a second or casting vote; but the Chairman elected for a particular meeting (in the absence of the Chairman for the year) will still have such casting vote (L.G.A., 1894, s. 31 (2), M.M.A., 1855, s. 41). The Chairman for the year will (unless a woman or personally disqualified by any Act) be, by virtue of his office, a Justice of the Peace for the County of London; but before acting as such justice he must, if he has not already done so, take the oath required by law to be taken by a justice, other than the oath respecting the qualification by estate (L.G.A., 1894, s. s. 31 (2), 22). Auditors. 6. The new Act alters the qualifications and disqualifications of Auditors, as in the case of Members, but otherwise leaves the mode and time of election of Auditors by District Boards unaltered. Three such Auditors, will therefore in the month of 24 April, in every year, be elected by ballot by each District Board, from amongst the persons acting as Auditors for the parishes in the district (L.G.A., 1894, s. 31 (1), 46 (9), M. M. Act, 1855, s. 194). Powers. 7. The powers of District Boards are not immediately affected by the Statute, but the Local Government Board may, on the application either of a District Board or of any (undefined) "representative body" within a London District, make an order conferring on any District Board, or some other representative body within the district (and either as to the whole or any parts of the district) the appointment and powers of Overseers and Assistant Overseers, and any powers, duties and liabilities of a "parish council." Such order may not. alter the incidence of any rate, and shall make provision for the existing interests of paid officers (L.G.A., 1894, s. 33). 8. Some local powers of considerable importance would be exercised by District Boards if the powers of Overseers alone were transferred to such District Boards by order of the Local Government Board, under this Act. Such an order might empower District Boards (in the place of Overseers) to make rates (to be still allowed by justices and published as heretofore) and to act in the preparation of valuation lists and on appeals either as to such lists, or as to rates (L.G.A., 1894, s. C (1 c. 1.) 33 (1), Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1809, &c.) 9. The powers, duties and liabilities of a Parish Council are very numerous (L.G.A., Parts I. and IV., and especially s. s. 5-14). Many of such powers are already possessed by District Boards. Other powers of Parish Councils are chiefly exercisable in rural parishes (e.g., as to inclosurc of commons and 25 formation of School-boards). Others (e.g., as to fire engines) are already exercised by the London County Council. But there are also many powers given to Parish Councils by this Statute Which, if conferred on District Boards, would largely extend their functions. Amongst these powers, it is important to mention the following which District Boards might, under this Act, acquire by an order of the Local Government Board:- A Control of parish property by:- (1). Acquiring the legal interest in all property (except ecclesiastical property) vested in overseers and churchwardens and their powers and liabilities as to other parish property (except as aforesaid) s. s. 5 (2), 6 (1 c. III). (2). Accepting and holding 'gifts of property real or personal, for the benefit of the inhabitants (s. 8 (1 h). (3). Maintaining and improving such parish property (s. 8 (1 i.). (4). Accepting, with the approval of the Charity Commissioners, transfers (to the District Board or its appointees) from trustees of property (not being ecclesiastical) held for the benefit of the inhabitants (s. 14 (1). (5). Appointing trustees of parochial charities in the place of overseers, and when the charity is not ecclesiastical) also in the place of churchwardens (s. 14 (2). 26 (6). Where the governing body of a parochial charity (other than an ecclesiastical charity) does not include any persons appointed by the parochial electors or inhabitants,then by appointing additional members of the governing body not exceeding the number allowed by the Charity Commissioners (s. 14 (3). (7). Appointing trustees and selecting beneficiaries where the vestry may be entitled under the trusts of a charity (other than an ecclesiastical charity) to appoint trustees or beneficiaries (s. 14 (4). [This power might also of course be transferred generally with other vestry powers, see "B" below.] (8). Considering, and supporting, or opposing draft schemes relating to charities (not being ecclesiastical) under the Charitable Trusts Act 1860(s.l4 (5). (9). Controlling the custody of public books, writings, or papers of parishes within the district excepting ecclesiastical registers and ecclesiastical documents (s. 17 (8). [The Act also contains provisions as to term of office of trustees, and excepts certain charitics founded within forty years, and defines the excepted ecclesiastical property and charities (s. s. 14 (7, 8) 75 (21). [Property vested in Churchwardens alone cannot be transferred under the Act.] B Powers of the vestries in the district could also be transferred to the District Board excepting as to ecclesiastical affairs (s. 6 (1 a). [This might involve the practical abolition of certain vestries in London 27 Districts, or leave them with nothing to do excepting in ecclesiastical matters. Where Vestries already appoint "Commissioners" under any of the "Adoptive Acts" herein-after mentioned (D) this power, and such control as the Vestries already exercise over such Commissioners, seem to be thus transferable to District Boards. But the Act cannot, of course, be also intended to authorize the Local Government Board to empower District Boards to elect their own members, although such a power seems now a strange legal possibility.] C Powers may also be given to District Boards to maintain and repair closed churchyards (where the cost is paid out of rates) and exercise other nonecclesiastical powers (if any) of churchwardens (s. 6 (l b). D Power may also be given to District Boards to carry out when hereafter adopted in any parish in the District, certain "Adoptive Acts," including the Baths and Wash-houses Acts 1846—82, the Burials Act 1852—8-5, and the Public Libraries Act 1892 (s. (7). E To provide and acquire buildings for public offices, and for meetings, and land for such buildings, and tc provide public walks and recreation grounds, or to contribute to the support of public walks, or pleasure grounds, and to acquire land for any other purposes for which a parish Council is authorized to acquire it. This may be done either by agreement with owners of land or (by authority of the London County Council confirmed by the Local Goverment Board) 28 compulsorily (s.s. 8 & 9). [This would be new so far as it gives the right to acquire land under compulsory powers ; but otherwise it would not much extend existing powers of District Boards. The consent of the London County Council would, under the Metropolis Management Acts, be in some cases necessary even for purchase by agreement]. F. To utilize any well, spring, or stream within the district, and provide facilities for obtaining water therefrom (s. 8. (1 e). [But private rights, unless acquired by agreement, or perhaps by compulsion (see above "E") are not to be interfered with. District Boards could not under this power bring water from without their district, and they are already prohibited from supplying it for domestic or commercial purposes (M.M.A. 1855. s. 155).] G To acquire (by agreement only and not compulsorily) any beneficial right of way, whether within a parish of the district or any adjoining parish (s. 8. 1. g). [This power is new so far, at least, as it would enable District Boards to acquire rights of way outside their districts. The consent of the London County Council might be required. M.M.A. 1862 s. s. 72 & 100]. H. To give necessary consent to stopping up or diversion of a public way ( s. 13). [But this would also be secured in London if the powers in this matter of elected vestries whose consent is now necessary under the Highway Act 1835) were transfered to District Boards, See above " B."] 29 10. Such of the District Boards as comprise parishes where there is arable or pasture land or any rural parts might obtain powers of Parish Councils as to allotments (s. s. 6 (1 C. Ill) 10) and as to repairs of footpath, not being footpaths at the side of public roads (s. 13 (2). There is also a useful power to combine with other District Boards or representative bodies having similar powers, for several of the above purposes, including acquisition of land, (E) utilizing water supply (F) acquiring rights of way (G) and to accept and hold gifts of property and improve parish property (A) (s. 8 (1 k). But if and so far as District Boards (on which powers of parish councils are conferred) rely on this Act the limit of expenditure, and the restrictions on borrowing powers, which exist in the case of parish councils, would have to be observed (s. s. 11 & 12).

REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 18D3. To the Board of Works for the Plumstead District. Gentlemen, 1. I beg to present to you my Annual Report of the Sanitary condition of the Parish of Charlton, for the year ending Decern, ber 31st, 1893. 2. The Births have numbered 368,— Males 201 Females 107 Giving a ratio of 29.16 per thousand of the population, estimated at the middle of 1893 as 12273. 3. Hitherto it has been my practice to estimate the deaths without adding those parishioners who have died in Public Institutions, &c., outside the parish, but as I consider it is only right to account for all, this year I have added these, and have made my calculations accordingly. C 34 4. The total amounting to 222, divided as follows:— Males 113 Females 109 222 Giving a ratio of 18.09 per thousand of the population. 5. Of these, 32 have occurred outside the parish in the following places— South Eastern Fever Hospital 6 Ormond Street 1 Woolwich Infirmary 14 Seamen's Hospital 2 London Hospital 1 St. Bart.'s „ 1 Greenwich Infirmary 1 Guy's Hospital 1 Camberwell Home 1 Bftnstead Asylum 1 The Moat, Eltham 1 River Thames 2 32 6. This is one less than l 1st year, and those who died a home numbered 190, against 182 for 1892. 7. At first sight this looks like a small increase, but when I add that, during the twelve months ending December 31st, 1893, 93 new houses have been certified as having an efficient water supply and have become inhabits I, I consider that the result is most satisfactory. This is a very large increase of houses in a parish which only numbers 12 15 acres, and the mortality may be considered to have been kept well within reasonable bounds. 35 8. The Table of Deaths now in use does not show all the causes of Death so I give the numbers of some of the more important ones as follows:- Cancer 9 Apoplexy ... 5 Paralysis 6 Cirrhosis 6 Senile Decay ... 14 Premature Birth, &c. ... 15 9. There were 12 deaths from Violence of various kinds, on all of which Inquests were held, out of which 7 were caused by drowning. 10. If these were eliminated from the Diseases causing death, together with tha 14 due to Senile Decay and the 15 from Premature Birth, &c., the numbers would be of course very largely reduced. 11. The general condition of the parish during (The past year has been very good, there has been nothing but what is favorable to record with the exception of Scarlatina, which has been considerable, but that has been common to the whole of the Metropolis. 12. The number of cases reported to me has been 153, out of which 71 were removed to the Asylu'ns' Board Hosp tal, and it is satisfactory to note that only (3 of these removed to Hospital died. You are well aware that at certiin times during the year, the pressure upon the Asylums Board for the accommodation of cases was very great, and that at times it was something like 10 days before a case could be removed. 13. I believe firmly that the Asylums Board did all that it possibly could in the matter, and your Sanitary Officers also 36 took all the precautions possible to prevent the spread of infection. 14. Considering the amount of Diphtheria that has existed in London during the past year, I am able to record only 5 cases in this parish. This was very favorable and better than last year, when 7 were recorded, and the general prevalence was not so great. 15. The question of Typhoid Fever is always an important one, but. there have only been six cases during the year, and that would go well to prove that the general drainage and water supply are very good. 16. In spite of the considerable amount of Small Pox that has existed in the Metropolis during the past year, not one single case has occurred in Charlton. This is very fortunate, but in a great measure we may attribute it to the fact, that there is not one single common lodging house or shelter in the parish. From what we can gather from other parishes in the Metropolis, these refuges together with casual wards have been the chief places where these cases have been found. 17. There were 23 cases of Erysipelas recorded but no deaths and one case of Puerperal Fever which was fatal. 18. Measles, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea, were all below the average, at any rate as regards mortality only 3, C, and 8 deaths respectively being returned.—This is satisfactory. 10. With regard to Influenza, although at times during the year there has been a considerable amount, yet 1 cannot say that. it has really become epidemic, and certainly no death can be directly attributed to it. 37 20. The fears of Cholera reaching here naturally gave rise to a good deal of work and correspondence with the central authorities, but at no time was there the slightest suspicion of any case. 21. The Marsh District is always a source of anxiety owing to the want of a relief sewer, of which I have had to complain for many years. Fortunately during the past year, only once has the place been flooded (Oct. 9th). I asked the Foreman of the Roads for a short report on this matter, and the following is an extract.— "East Street, West Street, Woolwich Road, Troughton "Road, and Delafield Road, and in all these places the sewage "forced its way through the drains and flooded several of the " houses." 22. Putting aside the question of Sewage finding its way Into houses and yards, for many years it has been a recognized fact that Chest diseases and particularly Phthisis are greatly increased, if not actually produced by general dampness of the soil—and here I should like to quote a short extract from Professor Smith's (Woolwich) Report of 1892, with which I quite agree.— "I do not think it is generally recognised that Phthisis in "a great measure belongs to the class of preventible diseases' "and that it ii incumbent upon Sanitary Authorities to use "every means to prevent it (i.e., dampness) unquest'onably the "Consumption death rate of a district is a much better guide as "to its healthiness than the ordinary zymotic death rate. 23. The every day work of the Sanitary Department has been most efficiently carried out by the Sanitary Inspector, and chiefly owing to the tact with which he has performed his duties there have been much fewer cases brought before the magistrates than there have been for many years past. 38 24. Twice during the year 1 have inspected the Bakehouses and they are frequently visited by the Inspector. They are all well kept, and the owners show every desire to confoim to the existing regulations. 25. I am pleased to acknowledge with my best thatks the assistance I have received from the various officials, whom I have had to consult during the past year, and from the Charlton Committee, whose support has always been so kindly afforded me. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HERBERT L. BERNAYS, MR.C.S., &c.r Medical Officer of Health for Charlton. Rivoli, January 23rd, 1894.

SURVEYOR'S REPORT. To the Board of Works for the Plumstead District. Gentlemen, 1. I have the honour to submit to you my Annual Report, on the various works executed in the Parish of Charlton, during the year ending Lady Day, 1894. 2. During the year notices have been received of intention to erect in various pares of the Parish 50 additional dwelling houses, 1 bakehouse, and 1 workshop, besides application and plan for re-drainage of house known as "Hauraki." A memorial church and vicarage, iron schools, and temporary offices for fever hospital. The plans and applications for the drainage of the above buildings have been submitted to and approved by the Board, and all the drainage works have been properly laid and connected with the various main sewers in the localities in which they have been built. 3. A new church has been erected on the Woolwich Road next Charlton Lane, by Sir Spencer Maryon M. Wilson, Bart., in memory of his son—Frederick P. Maryou-Wilson, together with a vicarage in Charlton Lane. 40 4. The Gullies throughout the Parish have been periodically flushed and disinfected and are in good working order and condition. 5. The Marsh Ditches or Tidal Sewers under the control of the Board have been properly cleansed, flushed, and the banks regulated and put in proper order, and the Penstocks have had attention throughout the year. 6. A number of stoppages has occurred in private combined drains in various parts of the Parish, and in many cases it was found necessary to take up and relay the drains, all of which have been promptly attended to by the different owners and put in proper working order. 7. Under the New Act which came into force in January, 1892, all cesspools have to be emptied by the Board at the cost of the Ratepayers in general. 15 Cesspools have been emptied during the year at the cost of £23 14s. 8. Survey, plan, estimate, and schedule of owners and occupiers were prepared in duplicate and approved by the Board for the paving of Sundorne Road. The total length being 831 feet. The whole of this work has been done by the Parish workmen at the cost of £590 3s. 7d. estimated cost being £704 2s. 6d. 9. Surveys, plans, estimates, and schedules of the owners and occupiers with apportionments, have been prepared in duplicate and approved by the Board, for making up and paving Invarine Road and Fossdene Road. These works are about to be commenced. 10. The Dust Collecting Works have been carried out during the year by horses, carts, and men, employed by the Board by the day and at contract price, and very few complaints have 41 been made of these sanitary arrangements beiug in-efficiently carried out. The expenditure being £687 12s. 10d. But as the number of houses is increasing, and in order to fully carry out the requirements of the new Sanitary Acts it will eventually form a serious item of expense on the rates. 11. A number of trees has been purchased and planted in various roads in the Parish with proper stakes and guards. 12. A portion of the footpath on the North side of Woolwich Road has been properly formed, kerbed, channelled, and tar paved by the Board's workmen. 13. The East side of Charlton Lane has been greatly improved by Sir Spencer Maryon M. Wilson, Bart., giving up to the Parish a large portion of land. 14. The watering of the public roads and streets has been carried out during the past year for a length of about 10 miles by horses and men employed by the day at contract prices (£25 per mile for the season) from the mains of the Kent Water Company, and by two carts and four vans belonging to the Parish. The repairs and painting to water carts and vans have been done by the Board's own workmen this year at the cost of £63 9s. 5d. The total amount expended on Watering Account being £750 18s. 5d. 15. In pursuance of an order made by the London County Council, the houses in Old Dover Road have been renumbered under notices served by the Board to the occupiers. 16. Notices have been served by this Board upon all shopkeepers in the Parish warning them against sweeping their refuse litter, loose paper, &c., from their shops and premises across the footpaths into the roads. 42 17. Survey, plan, estimate, and schedule of owners and occupiers were prepared and approved by the Board for paving a certain portion of road known as Mount Pleasant, between Mount Street and Sand Street, the estimate being £47 1s. 4d. 18. Surrey, Plan, Estimate and Schedule of Owners and occupiers were prepared and approved by the Board (but after" wards rescinded) for the making up and paving of Cresswell Park, Blackheath. The estimate being £182 7s. 4d 19. The portion of Lee Road within the Parish of Charlton has had the old Random Rangstone channellling taken up and relaid with granite pitchers, and the road re-metalled with granite. 20. A length of about 300 feet of the footpath on the north side of Woolwich Road has been formed and tar paved. 21. Improvements have been made during the year in compelling builders to construct Inspection Chambers at. intervals on combined drains, also of the ventilation of drains. 22. The tar paving and the repairing, tarring and gritting of the footpaths throughout the Parish have been carried out by the Parish Workmen. 23. The applications that have been made to the London County Council during the year for laying out new roads and erecting buildings beyond the regular lines of frontage in existing roads have had much careful attention and such recommendations as the circumstances of each case required have been submitted to the London County Council from time to time. 24. The whole of the Urinals in the Parish accessible to the public have throughout the past year been kept clean and in proper order. 43 25. The Gas Lighting to the Public Lamps has been carried out by the South Metropolitan Gas Co. New Lamps have been erected during the year. Two lamps in Priolo Road, Two in Invarine Road, One in Fossdene Road, One in North Street, and Two in Anchor and Hope Lane, and a few existing lamps removed to better positions. The whole the Public Lamps numbering 275 are lighted, cleansed and maintained by the Company at Contract prices. The amount expended during the past year was £891 11s. 9d. including removals, &c. 26. The Highways, Streets, and Roads within the Parish, about 12 miles, have been thoroughly swept and cleansed throughout, and have been repaired and re-instated where found necessary with metalling of suitable kind, according to the respective localities. The following is the quantity of Materials put upon the roads during the past year: Granite 548 yards Broken Flints 719 „ Broken Ragstone 204 „ 27. Notices for opening roads and footpaths have been received during the past year from the Gas and Water Companies and private individuals, and the openings have been repaired by the Board's Workmen. 28. I have had to write many special reports and furnish information in reply to inquiries from Metropolitan Districts and Provincial Towns. The attendance at the Police Court and preparation of evidence in support of the Board cases, have also occupied much of my time. 29. On the 31st August the 3 inch Water Main belonging to the Kent Water Company burst near the concrete wall in Church 44 Lane, belonging to the Board, the water escaping passed underneath the retaining wall undermining it to a great extent, and washing a considerable amount of detritus into the garden grounds below. The concrete wall had to be underpinned, and the ground well filled in. The tar paving on the opposite side of the road had to be relaid. The whole of the works were done by the Parish Workmen at a cost of £86 0s. 0d. The Kent Water Company paying a portion of the amount. 30. As regards the extra labour for cleaning footways, roads, &c., of snow. The following are details: The number of additional men employed was 41, and the number of ordinary gangs was 10, making a total of 51. The cost of the extra men amounted to £20 14s. 6d. Carts were employed at Contract price in removing the snow, ballasting the roads and sanding footpaths. 587 loads were carted to the different shoots, the cost being £28 9s. 6d. 31. In conclusion many other matters concerning the Sewerage, Paving, Lighting, have occupied much of my time and attention during the past year, which need not be especially mentioned in this Report.

The Sanitary condition of the houses in this Parish has much improved during the past year, which no doubt, is chiefly due to the frequent inspection of the premises, especially in the lower portion of the district. 2. I have frequently visited the premises of Butchers, Fishmongers, and Greengrocers, (especially during hot weather) aud found them clean and in a satisfactory condition. 47 3. With regard to smoke nuisance, I have kept observation on factories and other places used for trade purposes, but with the exception of one or two cases I have seen nothing for my interference. 4. The dust has been collected in accordance with the Board's regulations, and very few complaints have been received. 5. The Bakehouses and Cowhouses have been visited, the whole of which are in a satisfactory condition. [see list over] I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. CLARK, Sanitary Inspector.

I beg to submit my report for the 3 months ending Dec. 31st, 1893, during which time 1 have been Medical Officer of Health for the Eltham Division. 2. In that period there were 34 births, 16 male and 18 female, giving, on an estimated population of 5840, a birth-rate of 23 per 1000, calculated as for the year. 3. There were 32 deaths, 16 male and 16 female. 26 in Eltham itself, and 6 in "Outlying Institutions" of persons belonging to the parish. No deaths occurred in the district of those residing elsewhere. d 50 4. These would give a death-rate of 21'9 per 1000, which is almost double that reported for 1892, viz., 11.2. 5. If, however, the whole year be taken the state of affairs does not appear to be so bad. The figures for that period are— BIRTHS, 1893. Male. Female. Total. Quarter ending 31st March 16 10 26 „ „ 30th June 13 14 27 „ „ 30th Sept. 19 29 48 „ „ 31st Dec. 16 18 34 64 71 135 DEATHS, 1893. Quarter ending 31st March 6 11 17 „ „ 30th June 6 5 11 ,, „ 30th Sept. 12 9 21 „ „ 31st Dec. 16 16 32 40 41 81 These figures give a birth-rate of 23.1; and bring down the death-rate to 13.7 for the year. 6. On the other hand, I find that the death-rate for 1892 was calculated on 66 deaths, in an estimated population of 5736. But there were 15 deaths in "Outlying Institutions," which should as usual, I think, be added. 51 7. This method of calculation would show exactly the same number of deaths for each of the years 1892 and 1893, viz., 81; and would bring the rate for the former up to 14.1. 8. The mortality for the last quarter of 1893 was, however, excessive, and it may be accounted for in two ways. 9. 1st. There were 8 deaths from Zymotic disease during that period; whilst in the other three quarters, put together, here were but 10. DEATHS from Zymotic disease during 1893. First Three Quarters.

On the day after I received notice of my appointment by you, I visited the Public Offices at Eltham, and found about 20 notifications of recent cases of this disease. 12. As those affected wore all yonug children, I visited the National and Infant Schools at Eltlam, and found that the patients were nearly all scholars at one or the other of them— from the latter 36 children, out of 94, were absent. 13. On October 9th the Infant Schools were closed by the Rev. E. Sowerby. 14. As many of the sick as could be accommodated there were removed to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board; but it was a time of great pressure on them, and only 15 cases could be thus disposed of. 54 15. Disinfectants were liberally supplied, by the Sanitary Inspector, to the infected houses; and they were fumigated with sulphur as soon as the patients in them were pronounced convalescent. 16. The clothes also, which bad beep worn by the patients, or their attendants, were taken to be disinfected to the Board's apparatus at Plumstead. 17. The school authorities were asked not to allow any children to return to school, from an infected house, without a medical certificate—printed forms of which were provided by the Clerk for the purpose. 18. These measures were quickly followed by a subsidence of the epidemic, so that I thought it safe to advise that the School might be re-opened on November 6th. After that time there were only 3 fresh cases in Eltham proper, and they were removed at once to the Hospital. 19. There were 41 cases in all during the outbreak, and 4 deaths. The first case was in the child of the proprietor of a travelling van. 20. An expenditure of about £10 was incurred in carrying out these measures; but I hope you will be of opinion that it was money well laid out. 21. Perhaps I may be allowed to take this oppottunity to thank the Medical Gentlemen who attended the cases for their 55 co-operation—especially Drs. Smith, White, and Ford—as without their aid it would have been impossible to stop the epidemic so promptly. Diphtheria. 22. There were two cases of Diphtheria notified during the 3 months, both of which resulted in death. 23. One was in the child of a caretaker at a house in Winn Road, Burnt Ash, where there was nothing particularly wrong about the drains. 24. The other was in a child at Park Farm Cottage. Here the arrangements were very insanitary, but have since been put right. Puerperal Fever. 25. A death occurred from this disease in December, at Pelham Terrace, of a woman removed from a cottage at Hayworth's Brickfield, Now Eltham; fitly described, by Dr. Sturge who reported the case, as a "shanty." 26. The surronndings were very bad. There was a middenprivy close to the back door. The slops ran into a foul open ditch 30 feet away. Two pig-styes were at about the same distance. A large shed, in which upwards of 60 head of poultry (geese, ducks, and fowl) were kept, adjoined the cottage. So the yard must have been thoroughly fouled with excrement. 56 27. The cottage roof was in bad repair, and the walls were damp. The nearest water supply was from a stand-pipe of the Kent Water Works 160 yards distant. 28. The owner has been called upon to put these matters right. Insufficient Water Supply. 29. In October it was reported to mo, by one of the inhabitants, that 21 houses in Elm Terrace had closets without any water laid on to them. Also that there was a large and offensive dust-bin behind some of the houses. Notice was served on the landlord to abate these nuisances, aud the work has been done. Bake-houses. 30. In October I inspected the following bake-houses, and found them in a fairly satisfactory condition:— Name. Address. 1. R. Humphrey 77, High Street 2. Fredk. Claydon 94, do 3. E. F.

In conclusion, I beg to apologise for sending in this report somewhat late. The delay has been occasioned by difficulty in procuring the returns of "deaths occurring outside "the district among persons belonging thereto" for the first three quarters of the year.

To the Chairman and Members of the Plumstead District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I beg to submit the following Annual Report of the various duties and works performed so far as relates to my department for the above parish. Sewers, Drainage, and Cesspools. 1. The brick sewer 3' 6"x 2' 9" from a point in the Eltham Road opposite Eltham Green, going ur.der the Bexley Heath Railway to a point in the Woolwich Road about 100 feet North of Railway Bridge, has been constructed by the Bexley Heath Railway Company under the superintendence of an Inspector of the London County Council and is now complete. 60 2. The Court Road, Court Yard, Nos. 1 and 2 sewers ar now under course of construction and are so far advanced that several houses once drained into cesspools have now been connected to them. The Contractors have experienced great difficulty in the digging in tunnels rendered necessary by the depth of the sewers, due to the nature of the soil which is of a hard shelly clay, necessitating the use of sledge hammer and iron wedges to excavate it. The strata through which the Court Road Sewer is laid varies considerably the greater portion being through the above hard shelly clay, other portions being through green sand and pit sand respectively. 3. The sewers generally throughout the Parish have been cleansed and flushed regularly by means of Automatic syphon flushing tanks and by the flushing van. 4. The various sewer ventilators have been kept in working order, and the gas furnace for an up draught in the ventilator at the head of the sewer in High Street kept constantly alight. No smells arising from manhole or ventilator covers have been perceptable from the Board's Sewers, nor have any complaints been made. 5. Plans and sections have been submitted for new sewers in Lannoy Road, New Eltham, an 1 Meadowcourt Road, Eltham Road, which have both been approved by the Board and the London County Council. 6. The Sewer in Meadnwcourt Road consisting of 620 feet of 12 inch stoneware pipes embedded in 6 inches thick cement concrete, has been constructed by the workmen of the Cator 61 Estate under my personal supervision, with the exception of the flushing tank and 6 inch ventilating column which are not yet finished. 7. The surface wafer drain in Southwood Road East, being choked up with leaves, sticks, etc., I had it opened in two places and cleaned out and a manhole built, besides constructing two tumbling bays where the waters from the ditch at side of the load runs into the pipes. 8. There are 57 Cesspools as far as known in this parish, and 19 of these have been emptied by the Board at a cost of £30 16s. 3d. This work has been done principally by Plumstead Parish with their Ces-pool Apparatus, 4 have been emptied by Bexley Parish, and 5 done by your own workmen. There have also been several cesspools and privies emptied by the owners. 9. 17 Notices of intention to build and drain houses have been received during my term of office, and reported upon by me and approved by the Board. 10. Sixteen House drains have been laid and connected to the sewer during my term of office under my personal supervision. Gullies. 11. The gullies throughout the parish have been cleansed out regularly and flushed and disinfected. 12. Three new gullies have been constructed, 1 in High Street, and 2 in Court Road to replace the old obsolete and 62 defective gullies then existing. One gully has been repaired in in Wellington Road. One gully in Court Road I found broken as also the discharge pipes. This necessitated opening completely up, down to the sewer 30 feet deep, and building in new pipes and surrounding them with concrete. Disinfecting. 13. £19 13s. 0d. has been spent in disinfecting promises and bedding, £11 l1s. 0d. of that amount having been paid to Plumstead Parish for disinfecting bedding, etc., in their disinfecting apparatus. Dusting. 14. This is done by Contract for a sum of £150 per annum by Mr. Humphrey and only two complaints have been received during the past year. Highways. 15. 927 Cube yards of broken granite at a cost of £768 l1s. have been laid down during my term of office in High Street, Eltham Road, Footscray Road, Victoria Road, and Shooter's Hill, and rolled in with your Horse Roller. Scoring the old surface, and carting blindings and water, being done with your own men and horses. 16. 363 Cube yards broken flints at a cost of £161 13s. 9d. have been laid down in Woolwich Road and Mottingham Lane during my term of office, and rolled in with your horse roller. 63 17. The blinding used for covering the above "metal" has been collected off the flint roads from time to time and stored at different places. 18. 200 Yards cube of hard core have been laid in the Woolwich Road to raise the middle where it had sunk owing principally to the traffic of the horses of the horse artillery, horses hoofs being more destructive to a road than wheel traffic 19. Kerbing and channelling have been laid down with proper returns to carriage entrances for a length of about 80 feet in front of "Harrowfield," Eltham Road, and completes a much needed improvement. Snow Removal. 20. During last winter I had to engage 27 extra men and 10 extra horses and carts and drivers to clear the snow, the total cost of snow removal being £43 3s. 2d. After every fall of snow the horse snow ploughs were sent round the district and ploughed all the roads and streets. Hand snow ploughs were also employed to clear the pavements. The snow between Harrowfield and Eltham Bridge, Eltham Road, about ⅓ of a mile in length drifted to a depth of 3 feet and entailed considerable labour in clearing the road. 21. Two of your horses having got beyond work. Two new horses were purchased at a cost of 65 guineas and the old ones sold for £10. 64 22. Under the Barbed Wire Act a list was made out of all owners having barbed wire fences abutting on Highways and a copy forwarded to the Clerk and dealt with by the Board. 23. A Fire occurred in the Parish Yard during the year due to tar taking fire while being heated for the purpose of preparing tar paving. The London County Council's Fire Engine from Shooter's Hill attended, but the fire was extinguished before it arrived. The damage was made good by the Fire Insurance Company. 24. After conferring with the Lee Surveyor and my reporting to the Board, it was decided to make up the Cabstand at Lee Green, at an estimated cost of £173, Eltham to pay one third, and Lee two-thirds of the cost, and that the Lee Surveyor should do the work. 25. The stone carts, slop carts, water vans and cart, as far as necessary have been repaired and repainted, and the hose for the water vans has also been repaired and made good. 26. A hand truck and three barrows have been made and supplied, and found to expedite the working arrangement of the men. 27. Numerous applications for road breaking have been received during the year, these have all been repaired by your own men, with the exception of the Gas Company's trenches who repair their own work. Accounts amounting to £21 5s. 7d. during my term of office have been rendered for this work and the money collected. 65 28. The South Eastern Railway Company have been approached and asked to put in crossings over their entrances to Eltham Station, but they have not seen their way to do anything up to the present. 29. Plan and application have been referred to the Board and passed for a new road called Meadowcourt Road leading out of Eltham Road and over the River Quaggy to Lee Road. This road has been constructed, but the bridge over the Quaggy instead of being 40 feet is only 38 feet wide. The London Council's attention was called to this, but they decided to let it remain as it was and and no further action was taken. 30. The "Crown" having given up possession of a strip of land in Court Road for the purpose of widening it, they were asked instead of putting up the old unsightly wooden fence, to erect an unclimbable iron fence, which they agreed to do, and asked the Board to erect it, and charge them with the cost. This work has been done and makes a great improvement at that spot. 31. Several applications having been made to the London County Council to sanction erections beyond the general line of frontages, and having been submitted to the Board, were approved by the Board with the exception of shop fronts in Novar Road, New Eltham, but this application was granted by the Council. Lighting. 32. The Gas Lighting throughout the parish is contracted for by the South Metropolitan Gas Company, there being 98 ordinary lamps, 83 long distance lamps, and 1 Sugg's 3-light burner lamp e 66 33. Two new lamps have been erected daring the year and three shifted to more advantageous positions. 34. The lighting has been carefully attended to, only two or three cases of lamps having failed to bo lit coming under notice and that principally in the winter months due to the water in the pipes getting frozen. Watering. 35. The streets and roads have been thoroughly and periodically watered in the season by the Board's own horses and vans for a length of over 8 miles, by water from the Kent Water Company's mains, at the contract rate per mile, and disinfectants have been added and mixed with the water in the vans before sprinkling. General.. 36. There has been a considerable amount of illness among the Board's workmen daring the year which has increased the expenses on Highways to some extent. 37. Cottages in Haworth's field, Merchland Road, were in the opinion of the Medical Officer unfit for human habitation, and under the instructions of the Board I prepared a report and specification of dilapidations required to make them habitable. After informing the owner by notice that unless this work was done a closing order would be applied for.—The owner had the necessary work put in hand. 67 39. Applications having been made to the London County Council for Cow-house at Lyme Farm, and Slaughter House at High Street.—On request of the London County Council for the Board's observations thereon, it was recommended that these licenses be granted. 40. The owner of the "Bungalow," Mottingham Lane, having requested the Board to obtain permission to drain his and other adjoining premises into the West Kent Sewer, it has been resolved that permission from the West Kent Main Drainage Board be obtained for these premises to be drained into their sewer. 41. The Board having resolved to construct a New Sewer in Park View Road, I have surveyed, levelled, and prepared plans, estimate, and apportionment, on the owners for this work. 42. The highways, streets, and footpaths, about 15 miles of roads, have been regularly swept both by hand and horse broom. 9 miles of the roads in this parish are principal roads, having a constant through traffic from London to the Country, and entails a heavy amount of care and supervision with a small staff, to successfully cope with the accumulations of mud, manure, and other rubbish that is constantly and daily deposited thereon. 44. The trees also entail a constant source of labour in the season due to the litter of leaves. 45. All the tar paving has been tarred over and dressed with shell, a length of about 14 miles. 68 46. There are numerous other matters of routine both in office work and outside, which have occupied the major portion of my time, and which are too numerous and trivial in themselves to mention particularly. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT FINDLAY, A.M.I.C.E, Surrey or for Eltham Parish. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACTS AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH LONDON ACT, 1891. ELTHAM.

No applications for license to erect hoardings and scaffoldings have been received during the past year within the Liberty of Kidbrook. 78 3. The roads, highways, and footpaths under the charge of the Board, about two and a half miles in length, have been regularly swept, cleansed, and repaired where necessary, and kept in proper order, as heretofore. 4. All the sewers and public water courses have had attention and have been regularly flnshed and cleansed to keep same in good working order and condition. 5. The watering to the Public Highways and Roads has been carried out in the usual manner during the summer months by men and horses employed by the day at contract prices, and by one of the Board's watering vans, and the water obtained as heretofore from the mains of the Kent Water Works Company, at a contract price for the season, disinfectants being added during the summer months. 6. In compliance with the orders recently made by the Commissioners of Police for the removal of the cabstand from its existing position in Lee Road, Kidbrook, and the now site for the same having been arranged next the Quaggy River in Lee Road, the retaining wall necessary for the strengthening of the river bank at this point has been erected by contract, and the Board's workmen are now completing the paving of this new cabstand with granite pitchers and Norwegian edge kerb, upon a bed of Portland cement concrete, and the staging for the cabmen's shelter over the river will be provided by means of iron supports, the shelter being properly secured to the same. 7. The new road known as Meadowcourt Road, 1200 feet in length, and 40 feet in width, leading out of the East side of Lee 79 Road, near Lee Green, to the Eltham Road in the respective parishes of Kidbrook and Eltham, (one third being within Kidbrook Liberty), has been laid out and formed by and at the expense of the Cator Estate, the communication over the Quaggy being provided by a brick and iron girder bridge, also at the expense of the said estate. 8.

Negociations having been satisfactorily arranged with the owners of the above estate, a great and long needed improvement is now in course of completion by widening the High Road next this estate, and as the roadway, previously an average of 37 feet only in width; has now been increased to an average of 50 feet, the convenience arising therefrom cannot fail to be greatly appreciated by the public generally. The land necessary for this improvement, about 5300 square feet or thereabouts, in order to widen the road in question to an average width of 50 feet, between Belgrave Villas and the Old Road was purchased by the Board and the London County Council conjointy from the House Property and Investment Company Limited. L-i. The extension of St. Mildred's Road from Birchgrove to Hither Green Lane, a length of about 1700 feet, has been 86 completed and opened for public traffic by and at the expense of Lord Northbrook, and has been taken over by the Board, who have erected public gas lamps throughout this roadway, this being a most important addition to the thoroughfares of the district, giving direct access to the Lee Cemetery and Lewisham District respectively. 15. New Fire Alarms have been erected by the London County Council at Grove Park, Bromley Road (junction with Burnt Ash Hill), also near Blackheath Railway Station, and the East side of Lee Road, for greater convenience of residents in case of sudden outbreaks of fire. 16. An improvement has been effected upon the East side of Burnt Ash Hill, between Lee Railway Station and Woodstock Road, by properly tarpaving the strip of footpath between the Asphalte and the shops, by arrangement with the owners, who, on consideration of the Board taking over the future maintainance of this land, agreed to give up their interests in the same. 17. One new granite crossing has been laid down across the High Road, next, the Bible Christian Chapel, in response to a memorial from the Pastor and congregation of this chapel. Renumbering Orders. 18. An order having been made by the London County Council for the renumbering of the shops and houses upon the Eastern side Lee Road from No. 119 onward, which 87 order, after the service of the proper notices, has been complied with. 19. An order has also been made for renumbering and renaming the houses and premises in Granville Mews, Lee, for which notices were served in the usual manner, but in response to a general protest to the Council by the owners of property to be so renumbered, against retaining the name "Granville Mews," that portion of such order has been amended, and the whole thoroughfare will now be known as "Myron Place." Watering. 20. The efficient watering of the public highways, streets, and roads, about 16½ miles in length, has been carried out as usual by the Board's horses, carts, and men, assisted by extra horses and men engaged at contract prices, as before, the water being supplied by the Kent Water Works Co. at a contract rate, and during the summer months disinfecting fluid has been regularly added for use upon the main roads. With reference to this department I have also to report that the painting work to the water carts and vans has been satisfactorily carried out by workmen employed by the Board. Applications, Lines of Frontage, &c. 21. The various applications made to the London County Council during the past year for erecting building and shop fronts beyond the goneral lines of frontages in existing 88 streets and roads have had careful attention, and such recommendations as the several cases required have been forwarded to the Council. Dust Collecting. 22. In order to comply as far as possible with the requirements of the Public Health (London) Act, it has been found necessary to increase the number of collectors, and when complaints of non-removal of dust and refuse have been received, they have been promptly dealt with from time to time. 23. In consequence of the increasing difficulty experienced in disposing of the dust and refuse collected daily, the question of the erection of a destructor, as opposed to the schemes of sending away the refuse by rail and barge has occupied considerable time and serious attention, and at the present time, the facts and figures obtained at the cost of much enquiry point to the adoption of a destructor as likely to prove the most satisfactory and economical method of solving this difficulty, the preliminary measure of securing a suitable site with the minimum of opposition from neighbouring residents having yet to be satisfactorily arranged. Gas Lighting. 24. There are now 443 public gas lamps in the Parish, the same being lighted, cleansed, and generally maintained by the South Metropolitan Gas Co. in a satisfactory manner manner at contract prices. 89 25. The obelisk has been fitted with Patent Balham Burners, similar to those in use in the High Road, and the top of the four lanterns glazed with opal, thus making a great improvement in the light given around this obelisk. Generally. 26. The Board have secured the wharf in Ravensbourne Creek known as "Norman's Wharf," at a yearly rental of £110 on a 7 years lease, this being found of the greatest convenience fur the landing and storing of road metalling and other materials, and reduces the heavy charges previously paid for wharfage. 27. In consequence of the chaff cutting by hand being found to be a most costly and slow process, the steam roller has been brought into requisition, the old hand machine being removed, and a new patent chaff cutter fitted with proper levers, belt striking tackle, driving pulleys, shafting, and belting complete, now enabling the work previously taking twelve hours per week, to be done in two hours weekly, the cutting also being more efficiently carried out than hitherto, and the saving effected, and, amounting to 50 per cent. on the old system, or in other words a saving of £10 per annum upon the chaff cutting for the 12 hours. 28. With regard to the horses I have to report that the Board have had to dispose of five during the past year, and fresh horses have been bought to take their places at a total cost of about £230, but as these 5 horses were amongst 90 those originally purchased by the Parish some eleven years since, the Board cannot be regarded as unfortunate in this respect, the average age of these horses being 16 years. 29. The London County Council having, in response to the request of the Board, removed the horse, cart, and fire appliances from the Woodstock Road Yard, the shed in which the same were deposited has been properly lighted and fitted up with shelves, &c., for the purpose of a lock-up for disinfectants, and general store for the Sanitary Inspector's use. Relief Labour. 30. In consequence of the snowfalls of the early part of January last, it was found necessary to employ extra labour for several days for the removal of snow as far as possible, both by manual labour and the use of snow ploughs, thirteen n number, the average number of extra men for six days, being 49, or a total of 294 men, the total cost of such labour being £60 4s. 3d. Additional horsehire for cartingsnow, &c., during a period of five days, 17 horses at 9s. 6d. per day being £40 7s. 6d. Sand and ballast for spreading upon roads and footpaths cost £17 10s., making a total extra outlay of £118, on account of these snowfalls. General Labour. 31. The greatest number of men employed per week during the year, not including the staff or the relief labour above referred to, has been 70, the least has been 40, 91 average for the year being 50. This increased average is accounted for by the general increase of work in the Parish, and the fact of several of the various improvements and additional works (usually put out to contract) being executed by the Board's own workmen. 32. In conclusion, I have to draw the Board's attention to the great increase of work necessitated by the various new Acts now in operation, which, together with the general work of the Parish, which is steadily increasing from year to year, has added greatly to the work of my department, for which my principal assistant, Mr. Allen, is mainly responsible.

To the Plumstead Board of Works. Gentlemen, The following is my report for the past year : A.—Vital Statistics. Births. 1. There was an increase of 18 births as compared with last year. Presuming that the population continues to increase at the same rate as from 1881 to 1891, the birth-rate is diminishing. This is no doubt partly due to the general depression of trade, causing fewer marriages. Of the births 941 were females, 962 males. Deaths. 2. The death-rate 17.0 was high for Plumstead. The deaths from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Measles, and Diarrhoea, were all in excess of those registered in recent years, Whooping Cough G 98 alone of Zymotic diseases shewing a diminution. Influenza too was more prevalent than in any year except 1891, as is shewn by the annexed table: — Year ending March 1889 Year 1890 Year 1891 Year 1892 Year 1893 Deaths from Influenza 0 9 44 27 35 „ Bronchitis & Pneumonia 93 136 207 176 204 „ Phthisis 69 95 114 100 111 Total 162 210 365 303 350 Total deaths—all causes (uncorrected) 766 905 1046 919 1050 3. Whenever Influenza is epidemic the excess of deaths attributed to Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Phthisis may be safely put down as really due to the Influenza. There were 47 more deaths from these causes last year than in 1892, and 88 more than in 1889. Thus comparing 1893 with 1892 and 1889, about one third of the excess of deaths may be attributed to Influenza. 4. The death-rate was 16 9 in West Plumstead and 17.0 in East Plumstead. 5. Comparing the four quarters of the year we see from Table If. that the last or Autumn quarter had the highest mortality, and December was the most fatal month, this being the time when Influenza was most prevalent. 99 Infant Mortality. 6. The Infantile death rate, i.e., deaths under 1 year to 1000 births, was much higher than last year, being 141. In 1892 it was 109, and 1891, 129. The deaths under one year in each of the four quarters were 45, 53, 84, and 86 respectively. These figures indicate the probable causes of the high infantile death rate of the year, viz. : the prolonged hot weather of the summer and the Influenza in December. The Influenza appears to have been specially fatal to young children last year. The infantile death rate in the 4th quarter was the highest I have recorded, and slightly above the average for London. 7. The Infantile death rate was only 132 in West Plumstead, but in East Plumstead it was 143. This is doubtless due to there being a larger proportion of the educated and well-to-do classes in West Plumstead. Zymotic Death Rate. 8. The Zymotic death rate was 3.2. In the two preceding years it was 1.34 and 2.3 respectively. All the principal Zymotic diseases, from which this rate is calculated, with the exception of Whooping Cough, shewed an excess of deaths over last year. This rate exceeded the average of the London Sanitary areas. Uncertified Deaths. 9. The number of deaths which were not certified either by a medical practitioner or by a coroner was 30, being larger than in either 1891 or 1892. The percentage of total deaths was 3.0, as compared with 2.4 and 1.6 in the two preceding years. 100 Of the 30, 16 were under 5, and 14 over 5 years of age. These deaths were attributed to such causes as convulsions, heart disease, consumption (a baby), whooping cough (parents " peculiar people "), premature birth, hœmoptysis. But the attributed cause of death being given by a non-medical officer is not reliable; it is mere guess work. It seems very desirable that in all cases of death not attended by a medical practitioner an enquiry should be made by some specially appointed well qualified medical man. Only in this way is the real cause of death at all likely to be discovered, and crime prevented. Inquests. 10. 45 Inquests were held, compared with 43 last year. They included 17 deaths from violence, the remainder being from "natnral causes." 11. The deaths from violence included the following: Four suicides, one under a train, one by various poisons, and two by cut throats. Three by burns, two children, and one adult, the adult by upsetting a glass lamp. Six accidental cases of drowning, one being in a bath at the Infirmary, the rest in the Thames. Three from falls. Four infants from suflocation in bed. 12. Of the deaths from so-called "natural cases" five were caused or accelerated by alcoholic excess, one being a case of apoplexy, two hoemorrhage, and two diseased heart and liver. Two infants of single women died from neglect at birth, and one woman presumably attended by a midwife died from postpartum hoemorrhage. The death of a boy of 9 was attributed to convulsions from undigested food. 101 Phthisis. 13. The corrected number of deaths from Phthisis was 86. This gives a death rate of 14 per 1000, as compared with 1.2 last year. The increase is doubtless due to the greater prevalence of Influenza. The rate in England generally was 1.5 in 1891, In Woolwich it was 3.4 in 1889. So we see there is comparatively little Phthisis in Plumstead. There is more in West Plumstead than in East proportionally to population (the ratio being 8 to 5). I can only account for this on the supposition that the older houses are less healthy than the new ones, chiefly because more means have been taken to exclude damp in recently built houses. Measles. 14. After Diphtheria, Measles was more fatal than any of the infectious diseases, causing 45 deaths, most of which occurred in East Plumstead in the spring quarter of the year. Diarrhœa. 15. Diarrhoea caused 26 deaths, all but 2 being in children under 5. This is the highest number recorded since 1888, and was no doubt mainly due to the remarkably warm summer which characterized the past year. Age Distribution of Population. 16. Table IV. obtained by the kind permission of the Registrar General, gives the number living in Plumstead at the various groups of ages. From these I have calculated the following table to shew how the age distribution in Plumstead differs from that of England and Wales. 102 Numbers living at different apes per 1000 of total populations. Under 5 5-10 10-15 15-20 20-25 25-35 35-45 45-55 55-65 65-75 Over 75 England & Wales 130 120 107 97 89 147 113 86 59 33 13 Plumstead 147 12.5 108 88 81 160 115 82 49 27 10 17. This Table is to be read thus : out of each thousand of the population there are under 5 years 136 in England and Wales, L47 in Plumstead ; between 25 and 35, 147 in England and Wales, 166 in Plumstead, and so on. From this Table it appears that. Plumstead contains a specially large proportion of young children, and of persons between 25 and 35 ; the excess of young children is probably chiefly due to the low mortality of infants under 1 year, and the excess of persons between 25 and 35 to immigration of married men for employment in the Arsenal. 18. The death rates of different places depend in large measure on the distribution of the population, because people are much more liable to disease and death at the extremes of life, and least liable between 10 and 25. Thus the fact that the population of children under 5 is specially large in Plumstead would tend to cause an increased death rate, but the immigration of healthy workers between 25 and 35 would perhaps tend to diminish it. Judging from the great drop in the female population between 15 and 20 it appears probable that a large number of young women leave the district to enter service at that. age. This again would tend to increase the death rate. On the whole, as regards any effect the age distribution may have on the death rate I think we may say Plumstead is fairly comparable with England and Wales. 103 Increase of Population. 19. The continual decrease in the birth rate in recent years suggests that the population doe3 not increase so rapidly as it did. And assuming that there are now, as in 1891, only 6 people to a house, the population in the middle of last year would only be 55,608, instead of 58,093, as estimated on the assumption tnat the increase continued uniform. But it is more than probable that the number of persons to a house is now a little more than it was, say 625. I believe most of the houses built during the last few years are intended for two families at least, which means an average of 10 people. Further, the wish to live near the Arsenal is likely to cause an increase of persons in houses within a moderate distance. 20. On the whole I suspect that the estimate of 58,093 is a little over the mark but not enough to seriously affect the rates calculated from it. 21. Tables VIII and IX however are based on a population of only 57073, as estimated by the Registrar General. Comparison with other Sanitary Areas of London. 22. From Table IX we see that only five other areas had a lower death rate than Plumstead, viz.: Lee, Lewisbam, Wandsworth. Hampstead and St. George, Hanover Square. Six other areas had a lower infantile death rate, viz.: Lee, Lewisham, London City, St. Giles, Hampstead aud St. George, Hanover Square. Diphtheria was more prevalent in Plumstead than in any other areas with three or four exceptions. Scarlet Fever and Measles were also higher than the average for London. 104 Probably the principal reason why the Zymotic death rate in Plumstead is usually proportionately higher than the other rates is that having a high birth rate and a very low infantile death rate there are a specially large number of children at the ages most susceptable to the infectious diseases. B.—Infectious Diseases. Notification and Prevention. 1. A total of 886 notifications was received by me during the year, compared with 160 and 790 in the two preceding years. This entailed 886 special visits by the Inspectors, besides a large number visited in addition by myself; it also involved a large amount of clerical work. 2. There was an increase under all heads except those of Scarlet Fever and Puerperal Fever. Small Pox. 3. There were 51 cases of Small Pox compared with 3 in 1892. 34 went to Hospital and 2 died. Of the 17 that did not go to Hospital 6 were cases of mistaken diagnosis. All but 5 of these cases occurred in the parishes of St. John and St. Nicholas, The disease was prevalent all over London and was supposed to have been carried here by tramps. It was very prevalent in the parts of Woolwich frequented by tramps. As Plumstead Road and High Street is the highway along which tramps would naturally pass in going through Plumstead either to the Workhouse or to the Woolwich lodging houses, and also the highway 105 between Woolwich and the parishes of St. John and St. Nicholas, it seems not unlikely that the inhabitants of these parishes suffered chiefly on account of meeting tramps in Plumstead Road and High Street, this disease being easily caught in that way. Some of the cases were distinctly traced to visits to Woolwich and other places where Small Pox was prevalent. 4. It is noteworthy that only two of the cases notified were under five years of age, and both these unvaccinated. As children are found to suffer more than adults in countries where vaccination does not prevail, this fact is a proof of the complete temporary efficacy of vaccination, and of the effectual manner in which the Plumstead population is vaccinated. This latter fact is also shewn by Table XII, for which I am indebted to Mr. C. Jolly, the vaccination officer. 5. The Plumstead Committee decided on my advice to publish bills recommending re-vaccination, but the Board at Charlton vetoed the recommendation. If all the population had been re-vaccinated there would have been no Small Pox. There is a widespread belief that disease is spread by vaccination ; but it has been shewn by those who have experimented on themselves that it is very difficult indeed to cause disease in this way. Unfortunately many children inherit disease from their parents, and in such cases the compulsory vaccination is a convenient scape goat. Scarlet Fever. 6. There were 527 cases compared with 584 and 61 in the two preceding years. The epidemic of 1892 continued but with abated force. The disease was general over all the district, affecting St. James' and All Saints' parishes more than last year 106 and St. Nicholas less. There were more deaths than in 1892, probably owing to the fact that many who were taken ill in 1892 died in 1893, not to any increased fatality. 7. Burrage Grove and Bloomfield Road Schools had the largest number of cases. 8. 349 were treated at home and 178 at the Fever Hospital. Of the former 14 died giving a death rate of 4 per cent; of the latter 15 died giving a death rate of 8 per cent. No doubt the higher death rate at the Hospital is due to the fact that the most serious cases go there. 9. In only 35 cases (or 6 per cent) did the disease attack a second member of the household, and probably in most of these infection had taken place before preventive measures were taken. This is a proof of the great value of the work of the department. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. 10. The Diphtheria epidemic which commenced iu the autumn of 1892 continued throughout 1893, but diminished towards the close of that year. There were 179 cases compared with 118 in 1892. St. James' parish was most affected in proportion to population, as in the three years preceding 1892, .6 per cent of the population being affected ; in each of the other parishes (excepting Christ Church which had no cases) the percentage was only 3. In only 11 cases (or 4 per cent) did the disease attack a second member of the household. 52 of the cases of Diphtheria died, giving a death rate of 33 per cent, the same as last year. 107 11. Among those treated at home, 129 in number, 30 died, giving a death-rate of 30. Among those treated at Hospital, 28 in number, 14 died, giving a death-rate of 50. 12. None of the cases of membranous croup went to Hospital. As to the causes of the great prevalence of Diphtheria in Plumstead, and the comparative immunity of Woolwich, I can only repeat what I said last year, that I have found nothing but the manhole ventilators to accouut for it. Enteric Fever. 13. There were 29 cases of this disease compared with 22 last year. The cases were distributed all over the district as Table Y. shews. There was however a much larger proportion of adult men affected than usual, and 12 out of the 29 were employed in the Arsenal. They worked in different departments : 3 in the Carriage Department, 2 in the Laboratory, 2 in the Naval Department, 1 Control, 1 Gun Factory, Sighting Room, &c. Even allowing that more than one half of the adult males in the parish are employed in the Arsenal 12 out of 29 is a very large proportion, remembering that this disease is more prone to attack children and young people. 14. In former years it has been possible to trace most of the cases of Enteric to infection caught outside the parish, but not so this year. In fact, in the case of all the men employed in the Arsenal I could find no likely source of infection, but the conclusion seems to me irresistible that the source, whatever its nature, was inside the Arsenal. Within the last week a case has occurred in which the patient stated that he was in the 108 habit of drinking water used for an engine, and drawn from the Arsenal Canal. I have also been informed that it is no uncommon practice to drink the water of this canal. As this water is liable to be polluted with the excreta of labourers working in its vicinity, it is very likely to contain the infection of Enteric Fever. 15. If men are so foolish as to drink this impure water the Arsenal authorities cannot be blamed for the result, provided they supply sufficient sources of pure water. I may add that I have been in communication with the Director General on the subject of Enteric Fever in Arsenal Employees ; he instituted an enquiry and the Senior Medical Officer reported that there were no conditions in the Arsenal likely to give rise to Enteric. Cholera. 16. An invasion of Cholera was again expected last year, and as a matter of fact the disease did seem to get a certain hold of the country. No cases occurred however in Plumstead. I was in communication with the County Council and the Asylums Board on the subject, and advised as to preparation for Ambulance Stations, &c. I also made arrangements to secure the services of trained nurses in case they were needed, and the Committee authorized me in the event of Cholera appearing to take any measures which I might deem necessary before I could consult them. I again issued the handbill of precautions against Cholera published in 1892. The local registrars were requested to give me immediate information of any deaths from diarrhœa. Influenza. 17. When Influenza commenced to prevail in the Autumn a paragraph was inserted in the local papers on my 109 ation advising that those who were affected should remain in bed as the best way of getting through the disease themselves and preventing it from spreading to others. Use of the Fever Hospital. 18. Of the 886 cases notified 245 went to Hospital, which is much the same proportion as last year. About the middle of the year the Arsenal Authorities adopted new regulations under which no employe is allowed more than one week's leave on account of having infectious disease in the house if the patient can be removed to a Fever Hospital. But unfortunately last year, as in 1892, for a considerable time the Hospitals of the Asylum's Board were full and there was much delay in the admission of patients. The good effect of the new rule has been seen since the year closed; during the last few weeks more than one half the cases notified have gone to Hospital. 19. Having heard certain complaints as to the way patients were treated in the Hospital I asked for and received permission to visit the Hospital, and satisfied myself that as regarded diet and medical care, and general management the South Eastern Hospital was everything that could be desired. 1 reported however to the Committee that the construction of the wards did not answer modern requirements, and that I thought also the nursing might be improved. But especially I advised that some steps should be considered by which the Sanitary Authority might be brought in to closer touch with the Asylums Board. It seems an anomaly that Sanitary Authorities are quite without representation on this Board. 110 The New Fever Hospital. 20. A Local Government Board Enquiry was held in Woolwich on the proposed New Hospital in Shooter's Hill Road, and I attended and gave evidence in favour of the proposal. The Hospital is now in course of erection and I think it is great cause for congratulation that we shall have a Hospital so near to us. Instead of its being a source of infection as many fear, it should be just the opposite: by collecting all infectious persons within its walls from the neighbourhood it diminishes the risk of their spreading infection by being at large. The Health Refuge. 21. A house has been taken and furnished as a shelter for families requiring accommodation while their rooms are being disinfected. So far it has been used in only one case. C—Sanitary Work. Water Supply. 1. The water of the Kent Company's well in Park Road was on my request, analysed by the Board's Analyst, and reported to be of excellent quality. 2. It will be remembered that in 1891 the question of this well was investigated by General Scott, the Local Government Board Inspector, and that after analysis he reported that though at the present time the water of the well is pure and good drinking water, the analysis, compared with previous ones, shews that the water is changing in its character in a way that proves an increasing impregnation of the soil with organic matter. Having 1ll compared Professor Smith's recent analysis with the former ones I am pleased to be able to report that the water shews a marked improvement in this respect, the Nitrates, Nitrites and Ammonia having all diminished. 3. My attention was called during the year to two improper sources of drinking water; one a shallow well in close proximity to a cesspool at some tea gardens, the other a spring unprotected from surface drainage and pollution. 4. The Kent Water was already laid on at the tea gardens, and a Magistrate's order has been applied for to close the well The spring has been protected from pollution by masonry. and the family who used it now obtain their drinking water elsewhere, using the spring only for washing purposes. Sewers and Sewer Ventilation. 5. This subject occupied the attention of the Sanitary Committee and myself to a considerable extent last year, partly on account of my having in my last Annual Report given reasons for connecting the prevalence of Diphtheria with manhole ventilators, partly on account of the large number of complaints of nuisances from the ventilators. The long drought of the summer left the sewers without their natural means of flushing. I accordingly advised systematic flushing with water carts and hose, and suggested that the provision of automatic flashing apparatus should be considered for some sewers. At the commencement of the year too, I strongly recommended the Board to provide shaft ventilators as a cure for stenches from manholes, and that these ventilators should be properly jointed and carried 5 feet above 112 any windows within a horizontal distance of 20 feet. The internal diameter of shaft ventilators should be at least. 4 inches. Very few have yet been erected, owing no doubt to the difficulty of obtaining suitable positions. 6. When ventilator shafts do exist it is often proved that they are improperly jointed, allowing the escape of sewer gas below windows. \ Cemetery and Churchyard. 7. I have inspected the Cemetery in Wickham Lane and found it well conducted and the regulations properly carried out. 8. I wish the same could be said of the Churchyard. It would occupy too much space to tell the whole story of the ineffectual struggle to prevent the scandalous misuse of the Churchyard which still continues. I will only say that among other means taken to this end a public inquiry was held at the Old Church, by Dr. Hoffman, Her Majesty's Inspector of Burial Grounds. The evidence given by the Clerk, the Chief Sanitary Inspector, and myself convinced Dr. Hoffmann that there had been a persistent and flagrant disregard of the old regulations, and that the Churchyard was three times as full as it ought to be. It was understood by those present that Dr. Hoffman was in favour of forbidding any more interments except those of relatives, but when the new regulations came down they were found not to differ from the old ones except in certain details as to notices being given. And so a public scandal and condition dangerous to health continues; patronised apparently by the Home Office. 113 The Mortuary. 9. Early in the year I communicated with the Coroner for West Kent as to the fitting up of the mortuary in the Churchyard, and at his suggestion visited a model mortuary at Bermondsey. The Board, on my report, had the existing mortuary renovated and fitted with gas, lavatory, shells and other requisite apparatus, and engaged the services of a caretaker. But the existing mortuary, consisting of only one small room, is quite inadequate 10. The Board authorised me at the commencement of the year to employ an undertaker to remove a dead body to the mortuary at any time when I deemed such removal necessary, either on account of infectious disease, or under S. 89 of the Act, where a dead body is retained in a house so as to endanger the health of the inmates. During 1893 I did not have occasion to use this authority, but several times I succeeding in persuading persons to bury the bodies of those who had died of infectious disease, without the delay which unfortunately is too much the custom. Board and Church Schools. 11. I continued my inspection of Board Schools, begun when the Diphtheria prevalence commenced. I saw in company with the chief Sanitary Inspector, Vicarage Road and Orchard Road Board Schools, and called the attention of the School Board to certain sanitary defects, some of which have since been remedied. We also inspected St. Margaret's and All Saints Schools, with the result of their Sanitary conveniences being much improved; these were in the former instance in a very bad condition. I also visited the new schools in connnection with St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church ; these I found on the whole very satisfactory. 114 Bakehouses. 12. I have inspected the bakehouses as usual in April and October, and can only repeat what I said last year, viz.: that they maintain the former standard as to sanitary conditions, but this standard can hardly be a high one until it is made compulsory for them to be certified as fit for their purpose before occupation Cesspools. 13. I am glad to be able to report a considerable reduction in the number of cesspools existing in the district. Only 81 are now being emptied by the Surveyor, as compared with 284 a year ago. The reduction is mainly due to the new sewer at Abbey Wood. 14. My attention was called in the summer to a serious nuisance on the Heathfield estate, caused by the overflowing of cesspools into a ditch which passes into a pond. One of the cesspools was found not to be watertight. I reported on thematter at the time, and the nuisance is now kept under by emptying the cesspools about once a week. But there will be no satisfactory abatement until the cesspools are replaced by a sewer. This is I believe under the Committee's consideration. This nuisance was aggravated by the fact that the ditch in question flows under a roadway made of house refuse, which continually slides into the ditch. Dust Shoots. 15. Bust Shoots in improper places have as in former years been the subject of several reports to the Board. By the Byelaws of the County Council it is now forbidden to deposit house 115 refuse within 300 yards of houses, and seeing the very large amount of unoccupied ground within the parish which could be used for this purpose without infringing the bye-law I would strongly urge that ground be taken for the purpose without delay, and house refuse not allowed to be used in any other place. Drains. 16. It is to be feared that a very large proportion of the house drains in the district are defective and faulty. Table XI. giving the Sanitary Inspector's work, shews the large number of stoppages that occurred, and the number of defective drains found, viz.: 339. 11 Combined drains were taken up and relaid. In one case there there was found a large hole in a drain pipe, through which the water esaped, causing the drain to get blocked with excreta. Notice was served to repair the drain. When the Inspector called to see if the work had been properly done he found the drain covered in, but he had it uncovered and found that the defect had been repaired by laying a broken piece of drain pipe loosely on the top of the hole. For this the roan who did the work vvas summoned and fined £5 and costs. Again the drain was repaired, and again the work was found to be scamped, Another prosecution was undertaken, this time the landlord being made defendant. But as he succeeded in partly throwing the blame on someone else he escaped with a penalty of 40s. and costs. Finally the work was effectively done. 17. The question suggests itself, if drain work is done in this way while the inspectors are watching it, and even after imposition of a fine what must be the condition of most drains in the parish. 116 18. The remedy is to test every new drain and every drain that is relaid and repaired before it is allowed to be covered in, as I suggested in my first Annual Report. The Committee have recently purchased a very excellent smoke testing machine, but it still remains to make arrangements for one man to be employed in testing every new drain. Offensive Trades. 19. A person was found by the Chief Inspector to be carrying on the business of tripe boiling without the sanction of the County Council, in breach of S. 19 of the Public Health Act. The Council being informed proceedings were taken, and a fine of 40s. and cost inflicted. Unsound Food. 20. Five seizures of unsound food were made by the Inspectors, three being meat, one tomatoes and one onions These were all condemned on being seen by the Magistrate, and a fine inflicted in each case. Factories. 21. I inspected two clay pipe factories. In one the sanitary conditions were found satisfactory. In the other the ventilation did not appear to me quite sufficient and the proprietor was advised as to making it more efficient. The Arsenal Ditch. 22. The ditches on the levels in the immediate neighbourhood of the new football ground have been in a dirty and insanitary condition since the opening of that ground, the neighbouring 117 inhabitants having found they were a convenient receptacle for dead cats and dogs and other refuse. One ditch has been piped in by the football club, but the one along the Arsenal wall, belonging to the Crown, continues to be a nuisance, and so far, in spite of repeated applications, the Arsenal authorities have refused to undertake any permanent remedy. Overcrowding. 23. Table XI. shews that 22 cases of overcrowding were discovered by the Inspectors, in all of which 1 visited the houses and directed what measures were to be taken. With one or two exceptions they were all cases of overcrowded sleeping rooms only, and the standard of minimum air space required per head was taken as 300 cubic feet. For many cases it was found sufficient to advise a re-arrangement of sleeping accomodation, such as the use of living rooms for sleeping by older children. In other cases notices were served, involving the seeking by the family of a new house. These are difficult cases to deal with, as being usually due to poverty the people cannot pay for more accomodation, and if turned out of one house will probably go and overcrowd another. 24. Where there is overcrowding the people and their rooms are usually dirty. They are almost invariably occupants of houses let to more than one family. For this reason I recommended the Board to adopt the L. G. B. Model Bye-laws for lodging houses or else to put in force the Bye-laws which the Board adopted many years ago. I consider that this course would facilitate dealing with cases of overcrowding and would make it easier to enforce cleanliness. 118 25. My recommendation was rejected and repeated more than once, the Board appearing to have a fear that it was intended to enforce a wholesale registration of all houses let in lodgings. But when it was made clear that permission of the Sanitary Authority was requisite for the registration of each separate lodging house, the Board finally decided it was advisable to adopt some bye-laws but deferred the matter for the Vestry to deal with as soon as it came into powe r. County Council Bye-Laws. 26. These bye-laws were issued in the middle of the year and I lost no time in calling attention to the importance of many of the provisions they contained. One of these is that house refuse shall be collected at least once a week. The practice of the Plumstead Committee is to have a weekly collection where the dust is brought out by the occupiers, but if the dust is not brought out its collection depends very much on the activity of the Sanitary Inspectors. 27. The weekly collection system will very shortly be in operation over the whole district, but unfortunately there is on power to compel householders to bring out their dust unless the collection is daily. This is to be regretted: a bi-weekly collection would be in my opinion sufficiently often in Plumstead. The fault of the system as it works at present is that the dust is left at the very houses where it is most important it should be regularly removed, viz.: the dirty houses occupied by slovenly people who will not take the trouble to bring it out. 28. The bye-laws also contain full and particular regulations as regards the mode of construction of waterclosets, soil pipes,, drains, &c. 119 29. I advised the Board that it was very important these should be immediately made known to builders; I also drew up an improved list of instructions to builders based on the bye-laws, but it was thought better to leave this matter till the Vestry came into power, and I believe no steps have yet been taken to make the bye-laws known. New Inspectors. 30. In the latter part of the year I reported to the Committee that the Inspector for West Plumstead was inefficient and in consequence he was called on to resign. The Inspector for East Plumstead also resigned. As a result two new appointments were made in January 1894, and on the request of the Committee I reported on the suitability of the different candidates. Messrs. Martin and Rance were chosen. Both hold the certificate of the Sanitary Institute and have had some previous experience in the duties of the post. 31. Mr. Duck, Chief Inspector, and Mr. Ellis, Sanitary Clerk have continued to perform their duties with untiring devotion. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, SIDNEY DAVIES. 120 TABLE I.—Summary of Statistics for 1893, compared, with Registration London. Plumstead. London. 1.
