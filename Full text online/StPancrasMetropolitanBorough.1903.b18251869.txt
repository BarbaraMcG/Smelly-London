To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors,— I.—INTRODUCTION. I have the honour to present to you the Forty-eighth Annual Report upou the vital and sanitary condition of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Although the Registration District St. Pancras has remained practically the same area since 1856, except for a few adjustments of boundary described in the Report for the year 1900, the changes in the areas of the Registration Sub-Districts since the last-mentioned date have been so great that it has been found necessary to insert as a frontispiece to this Report the small maps of them in previous and present use. These three small maps show the areas (1) previous to 1900, (2) at the Census in 1901, and (3) at the present time. (The two south Southern Sub-Districts, although still separate, are amalgamated in the statistics for the present year, as it is intended to amalgamate them at some future date, and for the sake of continuity it is desirable not to have to make any further changes in the statistical records.) ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF TBE CENSUS OF 1901. The valuable information made available by the Census of 1901 has been partly quoted, summarised, and further calculated in the Reports for the years 1901 and 1902. Further information and readjustment figures have been received from the Registrar General and from the Statistical Officer of the London County Council, and this additional information is placed upon permanent record for present use and future reference in the following tables. In order to make the information with regard to the Enumeration Areas supplied in the Report for the year 1902 and in this Report of praclical use, a large map of St. Pancras has been inserted at the end of the following tables, and upon it have been outlined in red and numbered the Enumeration Areas to which the tables refer. 12 CENSUS, 1901.

No further case was notified for a month. On the 4th July a notification was received that a female aged 32 years, suffering from Small.pox at 148, C— S—, had been removed to hospital the day previously, and that the rash had appeared and she had fallen ill the day before that. In the following week, on the 7th July, a notification was received that a female aged 35, was suffering from Small.pox at 1, B— S—. The case was removed the same day, the rash appeared also the same day, and the patient had been ill for three days previously. These two last cases were in houses that almost abutted upon the house where the first case occurred, and it would look as if there was an undiscovered case spreading the disease. After enquiry this case was found at 4, P— P—; a female aged 9 years, who had been ill since the 7th June, and upon whom the rash appeared on the 11th, and was regarded as Chicken.pox. The same was forthwith notified and removed to hospital. On the 11th July a further notification was received that, at an adjoining street, a male aged 46, at 7, B— S—, was suffering from Small.pox. The case was removed on the previous day, had the rash the day before, and had been ill two days before that. Smallpox and Laundry Workers.—There have been numerous instances recorded of laundry hands catching Small.pox. Three very typical outbreaks commenced in laundries in Wandsworth, Hackney, and St. Pancras in 1901, at the commencement of the epidemic in that year, and others have been recorded elsewhere. A further instance must be placed on record. On Saturday, 17th October, 1903, a man aged 30, fell ill at a "house in Rochester Road. On the 25th October the illness was recognised as Small.pox, and he was removed to hospital. The dirty linen from this house was sent to a receiving office in Camden Road. On the 11th November a girl, aged 17 years, working at this receiving office, developed a Small.pox eruption at her home.in Islington, and was sent to hospital. The dirty linen received at the Camden Road office was sent to be washed at the laundry at Ilighgate Hill, and on the 13th November a girl aged 15 years, who worked at this laundry, was also sent to hospital suffering from Small.pox, from her home in another part of Islington. TYP1TOTD FEVER. Personal Infection.—In continuation of the cases described in previous years the following is another instance of personal infection. Name. Sex. Age. Address. Beginning. o o of illness. Date of Notification. Date of Removal. Robert T. M. 36 Q— C— Oct. 29. Nov. 12, '0.3. Nov. 13. Lily ,, F. 15 „ „ Nov. 28. Dec. 27, 'C3. Dec. 28. Nina „ F. 11 „ „ Dec. 28.

March 5. 43 This group of cases in the same family tells its own tale by the dates in the columns, "Beginning of Illness," "Date of Notification" and "Date of Removal." The father Robert was first attacked, and as the mother was unable to nurse him on account of pregnancy and lying in, the daughter Lily nursed him, and when Lily fell ill Nina nursed her. This is a very clear illustration of the spread of typhoid fever by personal infection from one member of a family to another consecutively, five cases over a period of five months. The father, who died a few days after removal to hospital, gave a history of having eaten oysters a fortnight before falling ill. The family occupied a dwelling of three rooms. Infcctivity and Size of Dwelling.—In January, 1903, Dr. Chalmers, the Medical Officer of Health, presented to the Committee on Health, a Report, to which was appended an account of an Inquiry by Dr. Dittmann, as to the incidence of enteric fever in the Eastern District of Glasgow from 1897— 1901. This inquiry elicited the fact that a relationship existed between the occurrence of secondary cases of enteric fever in the same family and the size of the dwelling. The dwellings were divided into 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more room dwellings. The first indication was that secondary cases occurred more frequently in the larger dwellings. The figures revealed in the second place that as the dwelling increased in size the intervals between the primary and secondary sickenings increased; enteric fever declares itself slowly, but as soon as diagnosed and notified all cases were removed to hospital from one room dwellings, and nearly all from two room dwellings, while patients were frequently nursed at home in dwellings of three or more rooms. In the third place the figures showed that the percentage of secondary cases in dwellings of one room was 6.2, of two rooms 7.9, of three rooms 8.3, and of four or more rooms 6.5, due, doubtless, to the possibility of isolation becoming greater as the dwelling increases in size, to the proportionately longer retention of cases at home, and to the ultimate breakdown of the rigid precautions in a proportion of the cases nursed at home. Typhoid and Bedding.— During the second quarter of the year a communication was received from the Local Government Board stating that they had received information in connection with an outbreak of enteric fever on board the training ship "Cornwall," that a large quantity of old army blankets lately received in this country from South Africa had been disposed of by certain London firms to persons in various parts, and that bacteriological examination of some of these blankets had shewn that many of them which were dirty and stained were probably specifically infected. Careful inquiries were made at all the places where the blankets had been delivered in St. Pancras. All the blankets were removed and disinfected and returned, and no spread of infection was traced to them. Watercress and Typhoid Fever.—It is now well established that shellfish that has been polluted by sewage may be the means of communicating enteric fever to consumers, and especially raw and scalded, and even partly cooked shellfish. The Medical Officer of Health of Hackney in an enquiry into the prevalence of enteric fever in that Borough during the summer of 1903 found grounds for the possibility of sewage polluted watercress acting as a carrier of the disease, and the Local Government Board was requested to enquire into this possibility. 44 DIPHTHERIA. The following table is of interest as showing (1) the number of cases of diphtheria notified each year in London since 1890, the first complete year of notification; (2) the number of deaths in London from the same cause in the same years, and (3) the number of doses of diphtheria antitoxin of a thousand units each distributed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to the Medical Officers of the Hospitals of the Board and to private medical practitioners. Notifications in London. Deaths in London.

MEASLES. The London County Council made an order that, on and after the 1st April, 1903, Sections 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73, and 74 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to dangerous infectious diseases shall apply, in the Administrative County of London to Measles, the order having been approved by the Local Government Board. In brief, measles in London is now a dangerous infectious disease except in respect of notification, and of removal to and detention at hospital. Disinfection is carried out upon application accompanied by a medical certificate. TUBERCULOSIS. In the prevention of tuberculosis it is interesting to compare the results obtained in two countries where the number of the population and the periodical increases have been very similar during the 19th century, namely England (and Wales) and Prussia. All diseases. A diagram showing the general mortality, male and female, from all diseases per 1,000 of each sex, in England and Prussia during the Census years, the number and increase of the population in the two countries being very similar. The two continuous lines show the English mortality, the two discontinuous lines the Prussian, the upper lines the male and the lower lines the female. TUBERCULOSIS. A diagram, showing the mortality, male and female, from tuberculous diseases per 10,000 of each sex during the Census years in England and Prussia, the number and increase of the population in the two countries being very simitar. The two continuous lines show the English mortality, and the two discontinuous lines the Prussian, the upper lines the male and the lower lines the female mortality. 45 The two following tables show the mortality from tuberculous diseases in each of the two sexes in each of the two countries in proportion to 10,000 persons of the population in each of the census years, remembering that in Prussia the census is taken every five years and in England every ten. England and Walej. Years. Male. Female. Difference. 1851 35.95 35.53 0.42 1861 34.52 34.02 0.50 1871 32.45 29.28 3.17 1881 27.21 23.63 3.58 1891 25.69 20.61 5.08 1901 20.89 15.48 5.41 Prussia. Years.

The differences in the mortality curves are at once apparent. It is seen that, whereas in England the female mortality has fallen more rapidly than the male, in Prussia the reverse has taken place. This is because in England since 1866 more attention has been devoted to the healthiness of the dwelling where the woman benefits more than the man, whereas in Prussia the man has benefited more than the woman by the German law passed in 1883 providing for the compulsory assurance of workmen against sickness, and the special attention directed to the treatment of consumption, a disease to which the greatest amount of sickness amongst working men is due. If now we compare in the following table the general mortality from all diseases in each of the two sexes in each of the two countries, during the same Census years, we obtain another aspect of the results:— Census Years. England and Wales. Prussia. Male. Female. Difference. Male. Female. Difference. 1851 22.8 21.2 1.6 - - - 1861 22.7 20.6 2.1 - - - 1871 23.9 21.3 2.6 - - - 1876 - - - 27.5 23.8 3.7 1881 20.0 17.8 2.2 26.5 23.5 3.0 1886 - - - 27.9 24.6 3.3 1891 21.5 19.0 2.5 24.2 21.8 2.4 1896 -- - - 22.3 19.6 2.7 1901 18.1 15.8 2.3 22.0 19.4 2.6 The accompanying diagram shows the above table graphically represented. 46 The general mortality curves in the second diagram of each of the two sexes are seen to be practically parallel, but whereas after 1896 those of England descend, those of Prussia are ceasing to descend as rapidly as before. The conclusion drawn from this by German observers, with some of whom I have discussed the subject, is that a certain proportion of the cured and restored cases have ten or more years later died from other causes. The conclusions I have drawn are, that sanitary measures in England directed towards the amelioration of dwellings have, since 1866, acted surely but slowly during thirty-five years in reducing the mortality from tuberculosis in the two sexes, especially the female, and that probably recent factory and workshop legislation will bring the male mortality parallel to the female, but that the special measures against tuberculosis in Prussia have accomplished this reduction in less than one half the time, namely, in fifteen years, and that when legislation in Prussia directed to the amelioration of dwellings also comes into force both the general and special mortality will fall below that of England. It therefore follows that if England is to continue to lead in the health of her working classes that she must adopt all the special measures available against the prevalence of tuberculosis, and especially against the pulmonary form of tuberculosis or consumption. In order to appreciate these special measures it is necessary to explain the reasons for them and especially to bear in mind what consumption really is. Pathologically pulmonary tuberculosis is dependent upon the access of a specific microbe to the human subject in a suitable bodily condition, due to predisposition, partly innate but mainly acquired by deficient quality of air supply, insufficient nourishment, or exhaustive work. The specific microbe may be expelled with the sputum in expectorating or with the droplets or spray in coughing and forcible expiration, and either pass directly from a suffering person to a predisposed person or else find a temporary and intermediate nidus in the interior of an inhabited building and ultimately gain access again to a permanent or temporary inhabitant of the building. In France stress is laid upon the difference between the communicability of la tuberculose ouverte and la tuberculose fermée, and preventive treatment in France aims at converting the ouverte into the fermeé condition. In other words, it is recognised that in the non-expectorating types of tuberculosis there is little risk of communicability. This differentiation simplified the position, as then one had to deal only with pulmonary tuberculosis accompanied with expectoration, to which four injunctions were applicable, namely, (1) do not breathe forcibly into the face of another person, but when sighing, yawning, hawking, or coughing do not fail to hold the hand before the mouth; (2) do not swallow the sputum, and do not spit upon the surfaces of an enclosed or covered place; (3) if consumptive, spit only into a proper receptacle specially reserved and prepared for the purpose; (4) if consumptive, do not sleep with another person. Passing on, one has to consider the question of diagnosis, notification, disinfection, and sanatoria. Diagnosis, the first desideratum is the earliest recognition of the disease, and this must depend upon the highly trained skill of the medical attendant, but it is evident that if expectoration is present it becomes a matter for the protection of the public that he should be assisted in making a correct diagnosis, and so the first conclusion is arrived at (1) that every sanitary authority should provide facilities for the bacteriological examination of sputum for tubercle bacilli. The discovery of the tubercle bacillus practically amounts to the voluntary notification of expectorating pulmonary tuberculosis for those cases in which the sputum is examined at public expense. 47 Notification: To voluntary notification the objection raised is the infringement of professional confidence between patient and medical attendant; but in the interests of the patient and the family and Mends that cannot be advanced against a second proposition, (2) that the expectoration of a person su ffering from a pulmonary disorder suspected to be tuberculous should be examined bacteriologically at public or private expense. To obligatory notification the objection made is that the intervention of the sanitary authority is likely to be of a kind to raise the opposition of both patient and medical attendant. On the other hand, the obligation exonerates the medical attendant from exceeding his duty, and may be so framed as to avoid interfering between doctor and patient in the words of a third proposition, (3) that it is desirable that cases in which tubercle bacilli is found in the sputum upon bacteriological examination should be notified under statutory obligation, and the precautions required should be prescribed by the registered medical practitioner in attendance. Disinfection: Upon the foregoing follows a fourth proposition, (4) that, after removal, on account of change of residence, or of entry into a sanatorium, hospital, or home, or of death, the medical attendant should require the sanitary authority to disinfect the room previously occupied by the pjtient. Sanatoria: In regard to the treatment of expectorating pulmonary tuberculosis away from home, there are three classes of cases to be provided for— incipient, pronounced, and advanced cases. This means— for the incipient cases, sanatoria proper, for the pronounced cases consumption hospitals, and for the advanced cases homes for incurable consumptives or homes for the dying. The provision may be made either in separate institutions or within the precincts of the same institution in separate structures, as is now being done in connection with some workhouse infirmaries. In the homes of the poorest the advanced cases are by far the most dangerous, the pronounced are intermediate, and for the incipient cases sanatoria afford the most promising and permanent results. In addition, it would also be desirable, in connection with sanatoria to enlist the co-operation of local dispensaries and medical institutions in discovering cases of threatening or suspected consumption in order that the benefits of existing charities and convalescent homes may be extended to them so as to render the sickly more resistant to the disease, and to re-establish their health. Whilst this is relieving the pressure upon sanatoria at one end at the other end it would be necessary to organise a system of directing those discharged from sanatoria and convalescent homes to such forms of occupation in the open air as would prevent recurrence of the disease and conduce to the maintenance of bodily health. The last-mentioned - namely, the organisation of the provision of suitable occupations for patients on leaving—is yet to be realised, but may best be undertaken in conjunction with sanatoria as well as the co-operation of dispensaries and other medical institutions in selecting patients most fit for admission. At present the only resort for advanced cases of incurable consumption amongst the poorest is the workhouse infirmary, and no doubt special separate provision would, sooner or later, be provided for them in all these institutions, as they would not willingly be admitted to sanatoria, where the period of residence will doubtless be restricted. The sanatorium is being regarded more and more as a place where for a limited period the consumptive may be cared for with a view to isolation, regimen, and education. The isolation will be temporary until the education is complete as to the necessary methods of personal hygiene requisite to prevent communicating the disease to others, and the regimen will be devised to endow 48 the individual with greater resistance and to teach him how to maintain that resistance. A fifth proposition follows therefore: (5) that sanatoria, hospitals or parts of hospitals, and homes arc required for incipient, pronounced, and advanced or incurable cases, respectively, of consumption. As to the realisation of these measures—The London County Council in May, 1903, made a By-law for the Good Rule and Government of the County of London, against spitting to the following effect:—No person shall spit on the floor, side, or wall of any public carriage, or of any public hall, public waiting room, or place of public entertainment, whether admission thereto be obtained upon payment or not. Any person who shall offend against this by-law shall be liable for each offence to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. This by-law it appears is enforceable by the police under section 16 of the Local Government Act, 1888, and section 23 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882. There is some prospect that the Metropolitan Asylums Board may utilise the unused hospitals at Darenth as sanatoria for incipient cases of consumption in the Metropolis. Hospitals and Infirmaries are setting apart special wards for advanced cases of consumption. Poor law infirmaries furnish homes for the dying amongst the very poor. And philanthropists are endeavouring to provide more suitable employment for consumptives cured, or permanently or temporarily restored to health. It remains for the Borough Councils to provide bacteriological diagnostic tests for the sputum of suspected consumptives, to adopt voluntary notification with a view to making it obligatory, and to disinfect when required. GLANDERS. During the year, Glanders amongst horses was a matter of serious consideration on account of the fact that the water troughs in St. Pancras and Stepney were not reopened because the spread of the disease was not abating. The Board of Agriculture was petitioned to appoint a Departmental Committee to conduct further investigations for the purpose of ascertaining the communicability of the infection of Glanders at water troughs by glandered horses, apparently healthy, of doubtful appearance, and distinctly unhealthy, and the proportionate chances of risks of infection from each class.

Removal to and Discharge from the Infectious Diseases Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The process of removal and discharge is as follows:— 1.—Application is made to the Metropolitan Asylums Board by telegram, telephone, or letter, or by personal application to any of the Board's Ambulance Station. 2.—The patient is removed conditionally upon the nurse receiving a copy of the medical certificate or note from the Medical Attendant. 3.—The Borough Council is informed of the removal by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the form also states to which hospital the patient has been removed. 4.—The patient is detained in hospital until recovery or death. 5.—Upon recovery the Metropolitan Asylums Board informs the Borough Council of the probable date of discharge, giving one day's notice. The Clerk to the Guardians is also informed of the transference, discharge or death of patients in a weekly list sent from the Metropolitan Asylums Board. 50 § 3—DISINFECTION. The following is a record of the disinfection carried out during the year:— Number of rooms fumigated 1145 Number of rooms stripped and cleansed 1157 Destroyed. Articles Disinfected. 31 Beds 1919 19 Mattresses 1112 36 Palliasses 1049 4 Bolsters 1992 13 Pillows 4348 7 Sheets 268 4 Blankets 4488 5 Counterpanes 1406 92 Wearing Apparel 13321 6 Bugs and Mats 982 7 Cushions 764 15 Carpets 1371 4 Covers 835 5 Curtains 830 13 Sundries 4292 Disinfection of Rooms.—During the year a disinfecting sprayer was found that appears to be satisfactory, and towards the end of the year a machine was purchased. The apparatus is comparatively light and easily portable, and can be carried on the back in such a manner as to leave the hands free. It is operated by pneumatic pressure, obtained by a small foot pump, previous to filling it by injection with disinfectant solution, and the tube and the spray with which it is furnished act so efficiently that it is possible to spray the walls of an ordinary room at one operation in about a quarter of an hour. The effect of four ounces to the gallon, or about 40 per cent. formaldehyde solution, was tested upon many kinds of wall paper, and the results have proved that sanitary papers and the better made of other kinds of papers are not affected, and it is only when the very commonest of wall papers are treated that the colours tend to run. Therefore it was proposed in future to substitute spraying the walls of infected rooms for the stripping off of the wall paper after Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, and Typhus Fever; but to continue the stripping after Small-pox, on account of the extreme infectiousness of this disease, which is many-fold greater than that of the previously mentioned diseases. The effect is that when the wall paper of a room is clean and in good condition, it is not stripped after the diseases mentioned; but if it is dirty and in bad condition, an intimation is served upon the owner to strip and cleanse the wall to abate a nuisance prejudicial to health generally. This mode of procedure very much facilitates the work of disinfection. The Borough Engineer undertakes to provide two men, if ho receives a request before four p.m. the day before, to strip and wash the surfaces of the room after the few cases of Small-pox that occur from time to time, so that in future it will be possible to dispense with the services of a Contractor. 51 The work done by the Council's disinfectors is: (1) removal of the infected bedding and clothing, and other articles, to the chamber for disinfection, and of useless articles to the furnace for destruction; (2) spraying the wall paper and surfaces of the room; (3) fumigating the interior of the room; (4) thoroughly airing or perflating the room, leaving the washing of the paint and woodwork, floor and furniture, to the housewife to do in the ordinary course of cleaning. In order to encourage this cleansing, there is left with the occupier a tin of soft soap, which is one of the very best cleansers and disinfectants. An additional disinfecting sprayer was later on purchased for use in large rooms, or in case of temporary disablement of one of the sprayers. CONTACTS' SHELTER. The following table shows the number of persons taking warm baths (including the cleansing of hair and nails) and having their clothes disinfected at the Contacts' Shelter.

The contacts treated during the year consisted almost entirely of those who had been in contact with Small-pox. SMALL-POX CONTACTS. In order to deal promptly with a person that has been in contact with Smallpox, it is the rule for a Medical Officer of Health to communicate at once personally with the contact if within his District, and if without his District, immediately by telephone or telegraph with the Medical Officer of Health of the District in which the contact resides or works, in order that any 52 necessary precautions may be taken within the next two or three hours. As a prevention of any oversight in London cases, within the next two or three days the London County Council circulates amongst the Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolis the history of each case of small-pox as furnished to them by the Medical Officer of Health in whose Borough the case occurred. In the Annual Report for the year 1902, page 32, it was reported, as the result of the experience of the small-pox epidemic, as follows:— "It became apparent that additional provisions are required for dealing with contacts in the prevention of the spread of small-pox and upon these lines:— (1) That it be declared an offence to refuse or withhold tion or give false information with respect to persons living in a house in which small-pox has broken out, with regard to their names, employment, or occupation, schools attended by their children, or as to any person not living in such house but employed therein. (2) That it be provided that any person inhabiting any part of a house in which a case of small-pox breaks out, who knowingly associates with other persons, without having his or her own person and clothes cleansed and disinfected, be liable to a penalty. (3) That in laundries the examining, sorting or marking of dirty linen be prohibited by the Home Office as dangerous, under the Factory and Workshop Acts, until after it has been effectually disinfected by boiling and washing in strong soap and water, or by some other equally effectual means. (4) That in common lodging houses and poor men's hotels, e.g., Rowton Houses, &c., when small-pox breaks out, inmates be prohibited from leaving the house until after the expiration of a fortnight from the date of removal of the patient, except to be removed to a small-pox hospital or to a quarantine station. Provided that this prohibition do not apply to inmates that submit to immediate disinfection and cleansing of their clothing and person, and undertake to remain in residence at the house during the above-mentioned period, and to submit themselves to medical examination when required. Provided also that the Sanitary Authority be empowered to make such compensation as they may consider adequate to any inmates complying with any requirements they may make. (5) That small-pox hospitals be required by the Local Government Board to provide an area of wider radius, free from workers and residence. So long as all the possible measures for the prevention of small-pox remain unexhausted, so long will the opposition to vaccination remain; and if it can be proved that the application of these measures of prevention fail in actual practice, the stronger the case in favour of vaccination and revaccination becomes." 53 Powers required for the first proposition have been obtained in the Liverpool Corporation Act of 1902, section 43, and the Brighton Corporation Act, 1903, section 42. Liverpool Corporation, 1902. Section 43 (1) The occupier of any building in the City which is used for human habitation, and in which there is or has been any person suffering from a dangerous infectious disease, shall on the application of the Medical Officer of Health, or the Deputy or Assistant Medical Officer of Health for the City, at any time during the illness of such person, and within six weeks from the occurrence of such illness, furnish such information within his knowledge as the Medical Officer of Health or the Deputy or Assistant Medical Officer of Health may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling measures to be taken to prevent the spread of disease. (2) Any occupier refusing to furnish such information or knowingly furnishing false information shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings. (3) "Occupier" shall have the same meaning as in the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889. Brighton Corporation Act, 1903. Part VII. Infectious Disease. 42.—Where an inmate of any building used for human habitation within the Borough is suffering from any infectious disease, then unless such building is a hospital in which persons suffering from an infectious disease are received, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say: — (1) The head of the family to which such inmate (in this section referred to as "the patient") belongs, and failing him the nearest relative of the patient present in the building or being in attendance on the patient, and failing such relative every person in charge of or in attendance on the patient, shall upon demand in writing from the Medical Officer of Health, furnish the following particulars or such of them as may be demanded, relating to the patient, and to the members of the family of the patient, so far as the same are within his knowledge or can be reasonably obtained by him, viz.:— (а) The name, employment or occupation, and place of ment or occupation of the patient; (b) The names of the members of the family of the patient being inmates of the building in which the disease has occurred, and their employment or occupation and place of employment or occupation, and in the case of children attending school the names of the schools attended. (2) Every parson being an inmate of the building in which the disease has occurred, shall upon demand in writing by the Medical Officer of Health furnish the following particulars or such of them as may be demanded. 54 The names and employment or occupation of himself and the members of his family being inmates of such building, and in the case of children attending school the names of the schools attended. (3) The employer of any person employed in, but not an inmate of the building in which the disease has occurred, shall upon receipt of notice in writing from the Medical Officer of Health of the existence of the disease, and written demand for the name of any person so employed therein, furnish such name, if the same is within his knowledge or can be ascertained by him by any reasonable means, to the Medical Officer of Health; (4) Every person required by this section to furnish information who fails to give the same, or wilfully gives false information with reference thereto, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings. On the 7th October your Council resolved:— (1) That a copy of these sections be sent to the London County Council requesting that section 42 of the Brighton Corporation Act, 1903, with the addition of the word "age" after the word "name" wherever it occurs, and of the words "of the Borough" after the words "Medical Officer of Health" wherever they occur, be inserted in the next General Powers Bill of the London County Council. (2) That the London County Council be requested to insert a section into their next General Powers Bill providing that "any person inhabiting any house in which a case of small-pox breaks out who knowingly and wilfully associates with other persons without having his or her own person and clothes cleansed and disinfected to the satisfaction of a medical practitioner, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings." v3) That a copy of Proposition 3 be sent to the Home Secretary petitioning him to make an Order for the prevention of diseases, especially of small-pox and consumption, communicable to workers in laundries. (4) That the President of the Local Government Board be petitioned to frame general legislation on the lines of Proposition 4, with the addition after the first words "that in" of the words "casual wards and poor law buildings." (5) That the other Metropolitan Borough Councils be invited to support these proposals. PERSONAL CLEANSING STATION. The Guardians being still in occupation of the Mortuary adjoining the Coroner's Court, so that the existing Public Mortuary could not be converted into a Personal Cleansing Station for persons infested with vermin, it was resolved meanwhile that the room adjoining the washhouse at the Disinfecting Station be fitted up as a couple of bath rooms, and a small waiting place, at a cost not exceeding £45. The infested persons who will come to bathe will in 55 the meantime have their clothing disinfected. These measures will be further reinforced when the sections of the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1904, come into force, empowering the Borough Council also to cleanse and purify infested bedclothing and other articles, and also to cleanse rooms and parts of houses infested with vermin. When these provisions are added the Council will be in complete possession of the power to cleanse and purify verminous persons, clothing, bedding, and habitations, and the machinery will be ready to at once carry the process out in its entirety. When ready the following handbill is intended to be widely circulated:— Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Personal Cleansing Station. The Borough Council of St. Pancras have provided baths and steam chambers for the cleansing and purifying of the bodies and clothing of persons infested with vermin or parasites. No charge is made for the use of these facilities, and applicants will be treated with every consideration at the Personal Cleansing Station, Cambridge Street, King's Road, Pancras Road, N.W. (on the east side of the St. Pancras Gardens), between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. John F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. § VACCINATION.

Stroke.—In the Annual Report for 1902 the enactments dealing with smoke were set out in full. Every year the London County Council issue a number of summonses against railway companies in respect of nuisances from smoke from locomotives, and obtain considerable penalties. See reports of London County Council's proceedings. Under the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845 (8 & 9 Vict., ch. 20), sections cxliv., cxlv., and cl., and the Regulation of Railways Act, 1868 (31 & 32 Vict., ch. 119), sections 19 and 40, there is no reason why the Borough Council should not take similar action, and, in fact, the Battersea Borough Council has taken successful action. In Tables 13 (a) and 13 (6) in the Appendix it will be seen that during the year intimation notices were served in 24 cases of black smoke issuing in such a quantity as to be a nuisance, in 7 cases of smoke discharging in such a manner as to cause part of a building to be a nuisance dangerous to health, and 5 cases of furnaces improperly constructed or negligently used, and also of 4 cases of effluvia arising from trade premises so as to be a nuisance dangerous to the inhabitants of the district. It will also be seen in Table 12 (a) that there are 221 smoke shafts on the Register, and 185 observations were taken of these, mainly upon complaints received, and that 118 re-inspections were made. These observations or inspections and re-inspections occupy a considerable amount of time, as the intervals between stoking are of considerable duration—at least twenty minutes. § 3.—DWELLINGS. (a) House-to-House Inquiries and Inspections.—For the purpose of ascertaining the mode of sub-letting, 1,019 inquiries were made from house to house in tenemented streets. For the purpose of discovering underground dwellings 2,423 inspections were made from house to house in tenemented streets with basements below ground level (Table 12 a). When the mode of occupation and sub-letting of a dwelling-house appears to a District Sanitary Inspector to be such as to necessitate periodical supervision of the condition of the premises he is instructed to report upon the printed form to the Medical Officer of Health with a view to considering the necessity for registration by the Public Health Committee. (b) Tenement Houses.—During the year 42 tenement lodging-houses were measured for registration, and at the end of the year 1,838 houses were upon the Register for periodical inspection ; 2,307 periodical half-yearly inspections of these houses were made, and 5,535 re-inspections after the service of notices. Also of the 212 dwellings entered in the Register of inscribed dwellings 411 inspections were made, and 174 re inspections after notices served. In Part "VI., under the head of Legislation, will be found quoted the case of Nokes and Nokes v. the Mayor, etc., of Islington, in which it was held that under the By-laws for Houses let in Lodgings it must be provided that the owner shall have notice before being subject to penalties for noncompliance with the By-laws. (c) Underground Dwellings.—During the year there were on the Register 36 underground dwellings ordered to be closed, of which 16 inspections were made, and 185 re-inspections after notices sent. 64 On the 22nd April a lengthy Report upon Underground Dwellings was presented to the Public Health Committee, and received by the Council on the 20th May. And on the 14th October a supplemental Report was made to the Public Health Committee. The temporary Inspectors engaged in the work of inspection made weekly returns, and the result of summarising these preliminary returns showed that they had inspected 129 streets, consisting of 4,480 houses, containing 7,474 basement rooms, of which 535 were unoccupied, 4,615 were occupied for purposes other than sleeping, and 2,324 were occupied for sleeping purposes, 1,247 in conjunction with rooms on other floors, and 1,077 not in conjunction with rooms on other floors. Upon revision of these rough totals it was found that there were 1,257 underground dwelling rooms occupied by 3,541 persons. Upon further revision of these returns it was found that of 2,589 basement rooms occupied for sleeping purposes 898 were occupied in conjunction with rooms on other floors, namely, 3 on the fourth floor, 73 on the third floor, 98 on the second floor, 258 on the first floor, and 466 on the ground floor, and that 415 were occupied in conjunction with rooms in the basement, and that of the total 1,276 were underground dwelling-rooms illegally within the complicated definitions of the enactments. The Supplemental Report referred to 8 additional streets, 258 additional houses, and 419 additional basement rooms, making a total of 137 streets, 4,738 houses, and 7,893 basement rooms inspected. The ultimate results of the first report and the supplemental Report are set out in the following table:— Revised numbers of 1st Report. Supplemental. Roport. Total. Basement rooms occupied for sleeping 2295 181 2476 (A) In conjunction with rooms on other floors 753 66 819 (B) In conjunction with rooms in basement 852 75 927 I Not technically underground sleeping rooms 269 18 287 Technical underground dwellingrooms.

Technically underground rooms 568 34 602 (1) Front rooms 518 33 551 551 (2) Back rooms 50 1 51 51 Total 1242 65 The result of classifying these underground dwelling-rooms according to structural conditions, worked out as follows:— First Series (Requirements of 1855). N umber. D i v. Class I.—Rooms less than seven feet high from floor to ceiling 140 A. „ II.—Rooms without a lire-place and proper chimney or flue .. 0 Class III.—Rooms with the ceiling less than one foot above ground level .. 551 (a) The ceiling below ground level more than nine inches 15 B. (b) The ceiling below ground level, but less than nine inches 77 Ground level to one foot above 435 (c) The ceiling level with ground* 586 (d) The ceiling above ground level, but less than half a foot 18 (e) The ceiling above ground level more than half but less than one foot 55 Class IV.—Without an area three feet wide at least Front 8 Back 2 ,, V.—With an area three feet wide or more, but— C. Incomplete Area 430 (a) Not extending along the entire frontage of the room 37 (b) Not extending to six inches below the level of the floor of the room 295 (c) Not open to the sky (excepting access) 146 D. Class VI.—Without a window nine square feet in superficies made to open 0 Class VII.—Ineffectually drained and secured against the rise of effluvia from any sewer or drain .. „ VIII.—Not provided with the use of a water closet and ashbin 0 * Note.—With regard to the angle of light and air to rooms with the ceiling less than one foot above ground level, in which all the other requirements are fulfilled, temporary respite might be allowed where the height of the area is less than double the width, and a longer respite might be extended to such rooms where the height of the area is less than the width, the former giving an angle of 60½ degrees, and the latter an angle of 45 degrees of light and air. Second Series (Requirements of 1891). As set out in Section 96 of the Act. (See under the head of Legal Requisites above.) Number of rooms falling into the Second Series .. 525 In 26 cases the particulars furnished were insufficient to admit of classification 26 Total 1242 66 Of each of these underground dwellings a full and detailed report in writing was laid before the Public Health Committee, and they are now being dealt with in groups as rapidly as it is possible to deal with such a mass of manuscript material four feet high. It was resolved by the Borough Council that each of the illegally occupied underground dwelling-rooms ordered to cease to be illegally occupied, be entered in a Register of Underground Rooms to be kept for that purpose. Later, upon a Report of the Medical Officer of Health, dated 2nd September, 1903, it was resolved by the Borough Council that each of the houses in which an illegally occupied underground dwelling-room is ordered to cease to be illegally occupied, be also registered and entered in the Register of Houses let in Lodgings for the purpose of being periodically inspected by the Sanitary Inspectors of Tenement Houses. The results of serving notices upon the first 50 underground dwelling-rooms illegally occupied are shown in the following table: — Condition of Rooms. Divisions. S. E. W. N. Total. Total number of notices and rooms 29 — 21 — 50 Occupied as sleeping-rooms in conjunction with rooms above basement 1 — 2 — 3 Occupied for other purposes than sleeping 7 — 10 — 17 Rooms empty 21 — 7 — 28 Premises demolished — — 2 — 2 These results were obtained after two prosecutions for illegal occupation. Three of the above dwelling-rooms (two separate dwellings) have been re-occupied since as sleeping-rooms. As the law becomes better known it will be probably more easy to obtain compliance than was the case with the first group of notices. (d) Common Lodging Houses.—There are 25 Registered Common Lodging Houses in St. Pancras, and these are supervised by the London County Council. Salvation Army Shelters are Registered by the London County Council as Common Lodging Houses, there is only one such shelter in St. Pancras. It is interesting to read in the Local Government Board Report for 1902-3, that Mr. Lockwood, the Board's Inspector for the Metropolis, states that a large number of poor who throng to London, and first take refuge in Rowton Houses, Salvation Shelters, and similar institutions, gravitate afterwards to Poor Law establishments, and that in the Parish of Hammersmith there were admitted 67 to the Infirmary 41 cases, and to the Workhouse 342 cases from one Rowton House during 1902, and that the cost to the rates of the persons from this one Institution (which is rated at only £320) was as much as £2,900. In St. Pancras there is one large Rowton House at the southern end of King's Cross Road, in the South Division of the Borough, and another large Rowton House is being erected at the northern end of Arlington Road, in the West Division. They are not registrable as Common Lodging Houses. (e).—Canal Boat Dwellings.—During the year, to the 31 wharves, the canal, and canal boats, 111 visits were paid for purposes of inspection. (f).—Working-Class Flats.—A list of these and their accommodation will be found in the Appendix to this Report. The dwellings erected by the London County Council in Herbrand Street, Tavistock Place, on the southern border of St. Pancras, will house at least 680 persons, and it is to be hoped will relieve the pressure somewhat in South St. Pancras. The East End Dwellings Company are erecting working-class flats on the site of Peace Cottages and Speedy Place in Tonbridge Street and Cromer Street, displacing about 330 persons and providing accommodation for about 450 persons. Trahrit and Housing. —A Report dated 25th November, 1903, was presented by the Medical Officer of Health, setting out fully the inadequate means of transit to and from St. Pancras north of the Euston Road, especially the means of transit to and from the area lying to the south-west of St. Pancras, and also to South London, and to Waterloo and other railway stations. Stress was laid upon the obstructive influence of change of vehicles and the good influence of direct through transit upon housing (g).—HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS. Part I. Area No. 1. Somers Town. 1 (a).— Churchway Scheme.—In continuation of the previous Annual Report on this subject, Wellesley, Somerset, and Seymour Buildings are fully occupied, but the new roadway of Churchway still awaits the removal of 146, 148, and 150, Euston Road for the purpose of opening the new roadway into Euston Road and converting: a cul-de-sac into a thoroughfare. Part II. Area No. 1, Somers Town—continued. 1 (b).—Part of area west of Chalton Street and north of Drummond Street line.—The houses here were dealt with individually under the Public Health Act some years ago. 1 (c).—Part of area east of Chalton Street. 68 1 (ei).—Chapel Grove Scheme.— In continuation of the previous Annual Report it was resolved on the 8th April, 1903, to make an application at the proper time for the closing of the narrow passage in Ossulston Street leading into Wilstead Cottages, and the narrow passage leading from Chapel Street into Chapel Grove referred to in the Saint Pancras (Chapel Grove) Improvement Scheme, 1898, Amendment Scheme, 1901, as these passages will not be required when the improvement scheme is carried out. On the 8th July, 1903, the Public Health Committee recommended that the plans, sections, and elevations for the erection of dwellings for the working classes on the Chapel Grove area be approved and adopted, subject to the approval of the London County Council and the Local Government Board respectively, and that the revised estimate of the Borough Accountant be approved and adopted. On the 29th July the Public Health Committee recommended that the revised estimate of the Borough Accountant be forwarded to the Finance Committee, when the Finance Committee reported that they had resolved that the scheme be referred back to the Public Health Committee, and that the Public Health Committee be requested to inform this Committee whether any attempt has been made to let the site to an industrial or other dwellings company, and as to whether, if such a course were adopted, it would not be to the advantage of and more economical to this Borough Council, and the recommendation of the Public Health Committee was by permission of the Council withdrawn. 1 (e ii).—Eastnor Place Scheme.—In continuation of the previous Annual Report, on the 25th February it was resolved that the block plan of the proposed dwelling on the Eastnor Place area when cleared be approved, and that the architect be instructed to forthwith prepare the necessary plans required by the Local Government Board. Oil the 8th April it was resolved to make application at the proper time to close the passage known as Ossulston Place, Ossulston Street, and the narrow passage leading from Ossulston Street into Eastnor Place, referred to in the Saint Pancras (Eastnor Place) Improvement Scheme, 1898, Amendment Scheme, 1901, as these passages will not be required when the improvement scheme is carried out. On the 8th July the Public Health Committee reported that they had further considered the plans, sections, and elevations for the erection of working class dwellings on the Eastnor Place area when cleared, together with the revised estimate of the cost of clearance of the area and the estimated cost of the erection of dwellings for the working class, and the probable annual income and expenses, and that after conferring with the Architect thereon they were of opinion that the scheme was too costly, and that they had instructed the architect to reconsider the plans, sections, and elevations, together with the estimate of cost, with a view to the cost of the dwellings being reduced, when it was resolved by the Borough Council that the matter be referred back to the Committee with instruction to consider and report as to whether the site could be let to an industrial or other dwellings company for the erection thereon of working class dwellings, and as to whether, if such a course were adopted, it would be to the advantage of and more economical to this Council. Areas No. 2 and 3. Prospect Terrace and Brantome Place Scheme.—In continuation of the previous Annual Report, with regard to the Order made by the Local Government Hoard on the 7th December, 1901, in reference to the areas of Prospect Terrace, 69 Brantome Place, and the Great College Street site, and the report of the Borough Council's Solicitor of the 15th October. 1902, and the communication of the Local Government Board of tbe 26th November, 1902, stating that it was impracticable to modify the Scheme before its confirmation, and that terms must be arranged with the Skinners Company before the confirmation could take place; on the 25th February, 1903, a Valuer was appointed to enter into negociations with the Skinners Company, as the Governors of Tonbridge School, to whom the site of the Brantome Place area belonged. On the 8th April, 1903, the terms of agreement with the Skinners Company were received and the Solicitor instructed, and after references to the various Public Departments and Authorities interested, an Agreement for the acquisition of the site was sealed on 28th October, and on the 13th November the opposition of the Skinners Company to the Order was withdrawn, and on the loth February, 1904, the Order of the Local Government Board was confirmed. Great College Street Site.—The preparations for the erection of working class dwellings on this site were commenced in July, 1902, and on the 29th October, 1902, the foundation stone was laid, and the work was proceeding towards completion at the end of 1903. § 4.-SCHOOLS. At the 66 grant-receiving day schools 108 inspections and 5 re-inspections were made during the year by the Woman Inspector. The new Education Act will probably introduce changes that cannot be considered at present. § 5—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. Factories.—The Man Inspector has 341 and the Woman Inspector 102 Factories upon the Registers for periodical inspection as to water-service, sanitary conveniences, drainage, and nuisances. During the year 200 and 175 inspections of these factories, respectively, were made, and 72 and 4 re-inspections respectively, after notices served. The Home Secretary has issued an Order with regard to the number of sanitary conveniences to be provided in factories and workshops, and this Order is quoted in Part VI. (Legislation) of this Report. Workshops.—The Man Inspector has 793 and the Woman Inspector 376 workshops on the Registers for periodical inspection. During the year 229 and 609 inspections of these premises were made, and 126 and 28 re-inspections. Workplaces.—These include restaurant kitchens, cab and omnibus yards, and domestic workshops, and home workplaces. Domestic Workshops and Home Workplaces.—Of these the Woman Inspector has 214 on the Register, at which 220 inspections were made. These places are the workplaces of out-workers generally working at home Laundries.—At the 89 laundries on the Register the Woman Inspector made 202 inspections and 34 re-inspections. 70 Restaurant Kitchens.—The Man Inspector has 63 and the Woman Inspector 158 restaurant kitchens on the Registers; at the former 59 inspections and 11 re-inspections were made, and at the latter 200 inspections and 14 reinspections. Bakehouses.—At the 178 bakehouses 907 inspections were made and 125 re-inspections. The inspections included the half-yearly periodical inspections, and the special inspections made by the Man Inspector for the purpose of making plans of the underground bakehouses, to be laid before the Public Health Committee for consideration as to the issuing of certificates of suitability. Underground Bakehouses.—On the 15th July the Medical Officer of Health presented a full report upon the requirements and classification of underground bakehouses. When all the necessary alterations have been completed and all the certificates have been granted a complete report of the results will be made. Reports of the Inspectors.—The following are the reports made by the Sanitary Inspectors of workshops. The first two are general reports, and attention is directed to the interesting results as to out-workers obtained by the Woman Inspector. The last two are special reports upon restaurant kitchens. Public Health Department, Town Hall, St. Pancras. 12th March, 1904. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report the work done during the year 1903. Factories.—There are now 357 Factories entered in the Registers. 200 were inspected, and notices served where occasion required for the abatement of nuisances found to exist. Generally the factories were found to be in a satisfactory condition. Workshops.—817 Workshops are entered in the Registers. 229 of these were inspected, and notices served for the abatement of nuisances found to exist. Generally, the workshops inspected were found to be kept in a satisfactory manner. Bakehouses.—The Bakehouses in the Borough have been inspected regularly in April and October, the necessary cleansing being done in these months. I have been engaged during the year in preparing the drawings required and obtaining particulars necessary, also classifying and preparing various details as instructed, for the information of the Public Health Committee, this work has occupied most of my time during the year, both at the office and at home. Generally the Bakehouses were found to be kept in a cleanly condition. Notices were served upon 86 Bakehouses 16 only being for cleansing, the remainder, by your instruction, for infringement of the statute laws as regards drain openings in, and water closets communicating with the baking-rooms. Restaurant Kitchens.—There are 66 Restaurants in which male labour is employed entered in the Register. The kitchens inspectel were found to be in a better condition than in the previous year. I append hereto special particulars with regard to these kitchens. 71 Generally.—Only 24 complaints of nuisances alleged to exist in Factories and Workshops were received during the year and attended to. 8 complaints of black smoke were also attended to during the temporary absence of the Smoke Inspector. The general conditions of the Factories and Workshops inspected during the year show a marked improvement on previous years. I append a tabulated statement of work done. Your obedient servant, F. A.

Some of these small kitchens are very well kept, and most of them are in fair condition. In many cases the kitchen and the proceedings of the cook are in full view of the customers. On the whole it may be said that the food sold on these premises is stored and cooked under conditions better than those which obtain in the homes of many of the customers. M. E. Bibbey. 21st January, 1904. § 6-WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICE. The condition of the water supplied by the New River Company and the West Middlesex Water Works, has been reported in the Quarterly Reports, as extracted from the Reports of the Analyst of the Local Government Board, and the Chemists of the Water Companies. The London Water Board will no doubt in due time take into consideration the abatement of water charges, so as to enable water to be laid up to each floor of a house let out in tenements, and also the questionable practice of allowing draw taps to be placed in water-closets and urinals. 83 §7.—DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. Plans of Drainage.—The London County Council in July obtained continuation of by-laws as to depositing plans of drainage under the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, section 22, and the Metropolis Management. Acts Amendment (By-laws) Act, 1899, and upon the receipt of these by-laws a revised form for the making of drain plans was drawn up, and towards the end of the year approved by the Borough Council. The following are the by-laws requiring persons about to construct, reconstruct, or alter the pipes, drains, or other means of communicating with sewers, or the traps and apparatus connected therewith, to deposit with the Sanitary Authority of the district such plans, sections, and particulars of the proposed construction, reconstruction, or alteration as may be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining whether such construction, reconstruction, or alteration is in accordance with the statutory provisions relative thereto, and with the by-laws made under section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. Construction of a drainage system as a whole. 1. (1) Every person who, in the provision of a drainage system as a whole,, is about to construct the pipes, drains, or other means of communicating with a sewer, or the traps and apparatus connected therewith, shall deposit in duplicate with the sanitary authority of the district, at their office, such plans, sections, and particulars of the proposed construction as may be necessary for the purpose of enabling such authority to ascertain whether such construction is in accordance with the statutory provisions relative thereto, and with the by-laws made under section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. (2) He shall cause such duplicate plans and sections to be clearly and indelibly made on a durable material to a scale (except in the case of block plans) of not less than one inch to every sixteen feet, and shall, amongst other things, show thereon every floor of any building in connection with which such pipes or drains are to be used, and the position, form, levels and arrangement of the several parts of such building, including the roof thereof, and the size and position of every drain, manhole, gully, soil pipe, waste pipe, ventilating pipe, and rain-water pipe, and of any drain passing under such building, and the position of every bath, water-closet apparatus, slop-sink, urinal, lavatory basin or apparatus sink (not being a slop-sink) and trap in connection with the foregoing. (3) He shall also show thereon the positions of all windows and other openings into the building, and the height and position of all chimneys belonging to the building within a distance of twenty feet from the open end of a soil pipe or ventilating pipe. (4) He shall at the same time deposit in duplicate with the sanitary authority of the district, at their office, a detailed description in writing of the intended mode of constructing, jointing and fixing any such drain, manhole, gully, pipe, bath, water-closet apparatus, sink, urinal, lavatory basin or apparatus, or trap. (5) He shall at the same time deposit in duplicate with the sanitary authority of the district, at their office, a block plan of the premises upon which any such building is to be situated, or any such work is to be carried out (drawn to a scale of not less than one inch to every twenty-two feet), and he shall show thereon— 84 (a) The block plan of such building. (b) The position of the whole of the buildings on the premises, and so much of the properties adjoining thereto as may be affected by the proposed work. (c) The names of the streets or thoroughfares immediately adjoining the premises, and the number or designation of the premises. (d) The difference of the level between the lowest floor of such building and the adjoining pavement. (e) The level of any yard, area, or ground, or open space belonging to such premises. (f) The lines, size, depth and inclination of the proposed drainage, and so far as can be ascertained without opening the ground, the lines, size, depth, and inclination of the existing drainage, the surface drains (if any) and if such proposed or existing drainage be in connection with a building the arrangements for the ventilation of the drains—the existing pipes and drains and the proposed pipes and drains to be distinctively indicated by different colours. (g) The position and form of every existing or proposed manhole or access chamber, gully, junction, bend, intercepting trap, or any connection with a sewer. (h) The points of the compass. Provided, nevertheless, that it shall not be necessary to deposit a block plan in any case where the plans, sections and particulars deposited in accordance with the first paragraph of this by-law clearlv shows the particulars hereinbefore required to be shown on a block plan. (6) The plans, sections, particulars and detailed descriptions hereinbefore mentioned shall be so deposited 15 days at least before the work is proposed to be commenced, and in the case where a building is to be erected, before commencing the erection of such building. Addition to, partial construction, entire or partial reconstruction, or alteration of, a drainage system. 2. Every person who shall make any addition to, partially construct, entirely or partially reconstruct, or alter any pipes, drains, or other means of communicating with a sewer, or the traps and apparatus connected therewith, shall be deemed to have satisfied the foregoing by-law No. 1, if he shall cause a deposit to be made (in the manner therein provided) of only such plans, sections, and particulars of the proposed addition, partial construction, entire o.r partial reconstruction, or alteration as may be necessary for the purpose of enabling such authority to ascertain whether such addition, partial construction, entire or partial reconstruction or alteration is in accordance with the statutory provisions relative thereto, and with any by-laws made under section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and, if in any case plans and sections have been previously deposited in conformity 85 with the foregoing by-law No. 1, it shall be sufficient for him to give in writing with the deposit the date of the previous deposit, and to show the new work on the plans and sections to be deposited, and only so much of the existing work as will enable the sanitary authority to see the relative positions of the new and old work. Provided that this by-law shall not be deemed to require the deposit of any plans, sections or particulars in the case of any repair which does not involve the alteration or the entire reconstruction of any pipe, drain, or other means of communicating with sewers or the traps and apparatus connected therewith. 3. (1) In any case in which an alteration of the drains must be carried out at once, every person who is about to carry out such alteration shall, in lieu of depositing the plans, sections, and particulars referred to in these by-laws, forthwith send to the sanitary authority of the district a notice in writing of any such proposed alteration. (2) He shall also within two weeks of the commencement of such alteration make the deposits required by these by-laws. 4. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing by-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of two pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of twenty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence given in accordance with section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, 5. In these by-laws the word "person" includes any body of persons whether corporate or unincorporate. 6. These by-laws shall not extend to the City of London. The foregoing by-laws were made by the London County Council on the 21st day of July, 1903, and were submitted to and confirmed at a subsequent meeting of the Council held on the 28th day of July, 1903, and the Common Seal of the Council was hereunto affixed on the 30th day of July, 1903.

The collection of House Refuse.—The reconstruction of London houses in flats is necessitating the more frequent removal of domestic refuse. Dust shoots are objectionable. Every separate dwelling should have its small separate portable receptacle. It is physically difficult for dustmen to carry down from each flat or dwelling each separate receptacle to the dustvan. The simplest method is to have a large portable common receptacle or receptacles for the whole house or building on the ground floor level and to cause it to be emptied daily by the dustmen, and to require the tenant of each flat or dwelling to cause his small portable receptacle to be emptied daily into the larger portable receptacle or receptacles. 87 §9.—NUISANCES. Regent's Canal Water.—It was resolved on the 17th December, 1902, that four samples of water should be taken from parts of the Regent's Canal within the Borough once in every six months and be sent to the Public Analyst for analysis. Accordingly samples have been taken from time to time and sent to the Public Analyst. The detailed result of the analyses have been reported to the Borough Council; the general results were that the Public Analyst found that the samples of water were sewage contaminated, but that contamination was not such as to cause a nuisance. §10.—SUMMONSES.

Summons dismissed, the magistrate holding that there was no evidence that the defendant intended to sell the fowls. 90 v.—FOOD. §1. FOOD PREMISES. The licensed slaughter-houses and offensive trade premises, and also the registered cowsheds, dairies, and milkshops, have been inspected periodically. Places where food is manufactured, especially where tripe, sausages and polonies, extracts of meat, and ice-creams are made, and shops and places where food is sold, have been regularly visited. The markets and marketing streets have been kept under frequent observation, and also visited on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. Bakehouses, restaurant kitchens, and similar workplaces fall under the Factory and Workshop Acts in Part IV. of this Report. Public versus Private Slaughter-houses.—The word "abattoirs," which is not English, merely tends to confuse the issue of any discussion as to "slaughterhouses." The real questions at issue are whether slaughter-houses should be dotted about a town (segregated) so as to render it impossible to continuously inspect them and keep the animals and meat in them under observation, or whether they should be concentrated in one spot (aggregated), and if concentrated in one spot whether they should belong to a number of private individuals, a company, or a municipality. When the policy of concentration is adopted it usually follows that, failing others, the municipality steps in and erects public slaughter-houses, but there is nothing to prevent a company from doing the same thing. The great difficulty is to transfer the slaughtering from the segregated to the aggregated slaughter-houses. Aggregation at some distance from the selling places but wiih increased facilities for supervision has to be weighed against segregation in proximity to the selling places, but with increased difficulties of supervision. Thus, the balance of opinion lies between the public interest in having a complete and continuous supervision of animals and meat intended for human food, and the personal interest in saving the expense of the carriage of dead meat from the place of slaughter to the place of sale, and in this connection those butchers who have no slaughterhouses and the increasing sale of imported dead meat, not supervised at or before slaughter, have to be taken into consideration. §2. UNWHOLESOME FOOD. Ice Creams.—Part VIII., Ice creams, sections 42, 43, and 44 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, were quoted in the Annual Rejiort for 1902, under Part VI., Legislation. Since a notice quoting these sections was distributed the following further notice for the guidance of the makers and vendors of ice creams has been printed and distributed to them:— ST. PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Health Department. Regulations to be observed by persons being Manufacturers of, or Merchants, or Dealers in ice creams, or other similar commodity within the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. 1.—No such commodity must be manufactured, sold, or stored in insanitary premises, nor in any cellar, shed, or room in which there is any inlet or opening to a drain, or which is used as a living room or sleeping room. 91 2.—Such premises must at all times be kept in a thoroughly clean and sanitary condition. 3.—All materials must be of a sound and wholesome description. 4.—All utensils used in the preparation of ice cream, &c., should be thoroughly cleansed and scalded with boiling water before use. 5.— Such utensils should not be used for any other purpose than for making ice creams, &c. 6.—When in the process of manufacture materials are boiled, freezing mast take place immediately afterwards. 7.—Such materials, after manufacture, should be kept in clean vessels, covered, and placed in cool, well-ventilated rooms. 8.—No ice cream or other similar commodity should be kept for a longer period than 48 hours after manufacture, if remaining then unsold it must be destroyed. 9.—If any case of infectious disease occur amongst the persons employed in the business, or living, or working in, on, or about the premises, in or on any part of which any such commodity is manufactured, sold or stored, notice shall be forthwith given to the Medical Officer of Health, Public Health Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. Any infringement of the above Regulations will be dealt with as the I jaw directs. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. August, 1903. Sub-Section (b) of Section 42 of the L.C.C. General Powers Act of 1902, Part VIII., relating to Ice-creams runs as follows:—"In the manufacture, sale, or storage of any such commodity does any act or thing likely to expose such commodity to infection or contamination, or omits to take any proper precaution for the due protection of such commodity from infection or contamination." In connection with Ice-cream, which is mainly composed of milk, it is interesting to draw attention to Regulation No. 30 of the Regulations as to Dairies, Cowsheds, Milksliops, etc., and as to precautions against the infection and contamination of milk in the Metropolis, as showing the view taken of contamination:—"30.—Every purveyor of milk or person selling milk by retail, shall not keep milk for sale in any place where it would be liable to become infected or contaminated by gases or effluvia arising from any sewers, drains, gullies, cess-pools, or closets, or by any offensive effluvia from putrid or offensive substances, or by impure air, or by any offensive or deleterious gases or substances." There is a tendency in small general shops to sell milk and ice-creams in proximity to paraffin, blacking, and miscellaneous commodities, which has to be constantly watched and guarded against so as to prevent contamination. 92 Food destroyed.—The following food, unfit for human consumption, was destroyed during the year:— Date.

Butter.—In the Annual Report for 1901, under §3 Adulterated Food, the Regulations of the Board of Agriculture were que ted with regard to the minimum standard quantity of milk-fat and milk solids other than milk-fats permissible in milk, and with regard to the maximum quantity of water permissible in butter. In July, 1903, the Board of Agriculture on account of the loss of water found in samples of butter improperly kept or wrapped, issued the following recommendations as to the sampling of butter. (1) The quantity to be purchased should not be less than one pound, except that it may be expedient to purchase only half-a pound in cases where there is reason to believe that the object of the purchase would be defeated if a greater quantity ice re demanded. (2) The division of the sample into three parts should be made as equally as possible, so that the portion reserved by the purchaser may be not less than one-third of the whole. It is desirable that each portion should consist of one piece only. (3) The portions should not be wrapped in paper, but should be placed, without pressure, in dry and clean screw-capped bottles in such manner that the water present may be retained in the butter. (1) The screw-capped bottle should be provided with a cork-lined metallic lid. The mouth should be as nearly as possible the full width of the bottle, and the cork lining of the lid should be firmly screwed down against the edge of the bottle. (5) The bottle, labelled with the necessary particulars, should be enclosed in an envelope of stout paper, which should be secured with the official seal. (6) The reserved portion should be kept in a cool dark place pending its production in Court in the event of proceedings being taken, and if directed by the Court to be referred to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue it should be carefully packed in order to ensure its safe transmission to the Government Laboratory. Milk Adulteration.—The following is an analysis of the operation of the Food and Drugs Acts, with regard to milk during the three years 1901, 1902, and 1903. North and East Divisions of St. Pancras.

In Islington in 1902 a similar course showed two cases of adulteration per 100 samples taken. This is evidence that the number of prosecutions obtainable per 100 samples of farmers' milk arriving at railway stations in London does not exceed 2 per cent. If the preceding figures be thrown into one table we have the following results:— Classes of Vendors. Number of Prosecutions per 100 . samples. A. Persons selling a gallon or two daily 17.3 =17.3 B. ,, ,, churn or two ,, 7.2 =6.5 C. ,, ,, several churns „ 6.1 D. ,, ,, a van load or more daily 5.3 E. Farmers or producers 2.0 =2.0 95 From this it will be seen at a glance the progressive stages of adulteration, and that the greatest amount of adulteration takes place amongst the smallest vendors who retail milk in farthing worths, and halfpenny worths, and to whom a penny worth is a large order. Warranties—Upon a communication received from the Bermondsey Borough Council, enclosing cojjy of a Report of their Public Health Committee with reference to the question of warranties, given under Section 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and in connection therewith the provisions in Section 20, Sub-section 5, of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, your Borough Council resolved on the 23rd December, 1903, that a communication be addressed to the Local Government Board, in support of the request made by the Bermondsey Borough Council, directing attention to the difficult and anomalous position of Local Authorities with regard to the use and abuse of warranties, and that the Board be urged to promote legislation to put the law in a clear and more equitable position.

FOOD INSPECTORS' REPORTS. The following are the Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors of Food and Food premises:— Inspectors' Office, Town Hall, St. Pancras. To Dr. J. F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. Dear Sir, I beg to submit to you a Report of my work in the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Borough for the year ended 31st December, 1903. Milkshops.—I made 357 visits to milkshops, and with four exceptions found the premises and milk vessels generally satisfactory. During these visits I found 45 persons selling milk without being registered in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order; this is an increase on the number of last year. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—I obtained 250 samples of milk, butter, and other articles for analysis by the Public Analyst, of which 48 samples were adulterated, and proceedings taken in 15 cases. Licensed Slaughter-houses.—I made 242 inspections of the eight private slaughter-houses in the divisions and saw 743 sheep, 123 pigs, 168 bullocks, 9 calves, and 46 lambs killed and dressed, and such organs as on examination were found to be diseased I had removed by consent of the owners, under Sub-section 8 of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The following table shows the number of animals found to be diseased, nature of disease, &c.:— No. Description of Carcases. Disease. Where affected. How disposed of. 1 Ox Tuberculosis Liver and Lungs Destroyed at the Dust Destructor 11 Oxen Flukes Livers tt tt 2 Sheep Flukes Livers and Lungs tt tt 1 Ox Abscess Liver tt ft 1 Ox Abscess Lungs tt tt 3 Oxen Abscess Livers ft tt 1 Sheep Abscess Lungs tt tt 2 Oxen Echinococcus veterinoruin Livers tt tt 1 Sheep Echinococcus veterinorum Liver tt tt On two occasions I had to call the attention of the Licensee to breaches of the By-laws. I might mention that at some of the slaughter-houses slaughtering takes place after office hours. 99 Licensed Cowhouses.—There are now only eight licensed cowsheds in the divisions, one Licensee did not renew his license, having given up keeping cows. I paid 138 visits to the cowsheds and found them fairly satisfactory. Marketing Places.—I made 1562 inspections of the various market places, including butchers', pork butchers', poulterers', fishmongers', Greengrocers' shops, &c., and made applications to the Magistrates sitting at the Police Courts to condemn and order the destruction of certain unsound food. The following food was destroyed at the Council's Dust Destructor, in addition to that found at slaughter-houses:— 78 lbs. plaice. 1 cwt. skate. 1 cwt. mussels. 34 cwt. potatoes. 25 ducks. 22 fowls. 78 tins of sardines. 18 tins of milk. Also a quantity of oranges, apples, plums, lemons, &c. Prepared Foods.—There is only one tripe boiler who dresses tripe and prepares livers, hearts, and other organs for consumption by domestic animals, as well as by man, and sells both classes of food at the same shop. I frequently called here aud always found it satisfactory. Meat Extractor and Sausage Maker.—I also visited these premises and found, with one exception, the meat in preparation for food sweet and sound. Since making my last Report I have been instructed to supervise the makers of ice cream and other similar commodities in respect to the carrying out of the London County Council By-laws. There are 138 makers in the divisions, and I have found the premises, &c., fairly clean and the By-laws carried out, with few exceptions, where I found ice cream made, or partly made, in living rooms. I am, &c., H. R. Child, Inspector of Meat and other Foods. Borough of St. Pancras, Town Hall. 1904. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit to you my Annual Report for the year ending December 31st, 1903, for the South and West Divisions of the Borough. Markets. The market streets, stalls, costers' barrows, greengrocers', fish and provision shops have been inspected daily. I have not made any seizures of unsound food or fruit during the year, against fourteen seizures for the year 1902. This is no doubt in consequence of constant inspection, dealers probably finding it does not pay to expose unwholesome food. 100 Food Factories.—There are eleven poloney and sausage makers in my district, whose premises are frequently but irregularly inspected. I have not had occasion to make any seizures. Of the meat, &c., used and the meat in pickle, I have not found any tainted or unfit for food, and the premises are kept in a cleaidy and sanitary condition. Food and Drugs Act.—Two hundred and forty samples of food have been submitted by me to the Public Analyst for analyses. Slaughterhouses.—I have made 231 inspections of the slaughterhouses in my district; the by-laws and regulations have been respected by the licensees, and the premises kept in a cleanly condition. The animals slaughtered have been free from disease and of good quality. Cowhouses.—There are seven licensed cowhouses in the district, registered to keep 102 cows. There were not any infringements of the by-laws to report. The animals were in a healthy condition and free from contagious disease. Milkshaps and Dairies.—1 made 587 inspections of premises registered for the sale of milk and found them fairly well kept, the small general shops not being quite up to the standard of the larger vendors, where nothing but dairy produce is sold. Ice Cream Makers.—Frequent inspections have been made of the premises where ice creams are sold, also the vendors' barrows in the streets. The utensils have also been examined, and only in three cases has it been necessary to report any infringements of the regulations. Unsound Food.—The following articles have been destroyed as unfit for human food:— 12 cwt. of pears. ½ box of lemons. 20 lbs. of plums. 5 lbs. of cherries. 24 bananas. 1 carcase of a pig. Legal Proceedings.—I attended the Police Courts 43 times in connection with the discharge of my duties as Food Inspector, this being a decrease of 17 attendances on those of 1902. I am, yours obediently, J. Osborne. In pector of Meat and other Foods. Town Hall, Pancras Road, Canal Boats Act. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, During the year 1903 I made 111 inspections on the Regent's Canal in connection with the above Act. Seventy-one registered dwelling boats were inspected; in three cases I had to report infringements of the by-laws to the Committee, when the owners were given notice and the necessary work carried out without resort to legal proceedings. Yours obediently, J. Osborne, Canal Boats Inspector. 101 VI.—LEGISLATION. §1-GENERAL ACTS. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1903. (3 Edw. 7, Ch. XXXIX.) Section I extends the maximum term for the repayment of loans from 60 to 80 years. The Local Government Board in their circular letter on the new Act, dated 22nd September, 1903, stated that they propose as a general rule to allow the full term of 80 years for the repayment of money borrowed for the purchase of freehold land, and 60 years for the repayment of money borrowed for the erection of buildings under the Housing Acts. Section 2 permits the transfer of any powers and duties of the Home Office to the Local Government Board. Section 3 imposes Jhe obligation upon any authority, company, or other person acquiring land under any Act, or Order, to comply with the provisions in the Schedule as to the provision of dwelling accommodation where thirty or more persons of the working classes may be displaced from occupation and not to enter on the dwellings so occupied until the Local Government Board have approved of a housing scheme. Section 4 enables the Local Government Board to order a scheme to be made; in case of failure to make such scheme, the order may be enforced by mandamus. Section 5 amends the procedure for the confirmation of an improvement scheme. Section 6 enables a proposed scheme that has been framed in an Order to be amended before confirmation. Section 7 enables neighbouring lands to be included in the area of a scheme. Section 8 amends the law with regard to Closing Orders. Under the old Act notice had first to be given to place the premises in repair. The Act now gives power, in cases in which the Local Authority thinks a notice cannot or will not be obeyed, to apply to a magistrate and take out a summons for a closing order without giving the preliminary notice. Section 9 provides that when houses are demolished under the Act, and the sale of the materials fails to cover the cost of the demolition the balance can be recovered from the owner as a civil debt. Section 10 gives a speedy and more efficacious way of recovery of possession of a house in respect of which a closing order has been made. Section 11 empowers the Council if they supply lodging houses, or if they supply housing accommodation, to provide and maintain in connection with such accommodation, shops, recreation grounds or other buildings or land, which in the opinion of the Board might serve a beneficial purpose. An authority may for instance, build a block of artisan's dwelling, with shops or workshops, or provide in connection with artisan's dwellings a playground for children or a gymnasium. 102 Section 12 renders it impossible for landlords and tenants to agree to contract themselves out of the provisions of the principal Act, which enacts a condition is implied in letting a house or part of a house for habitation by the working classes that such house is at the commencement of the holding fit for human habitation. Section 13 relates to the services of notices. Sections 14, 15, and 16 specially apply to London, enabling agreements as to contribution to schemes to be made between the London County Council and the Metropolition Borough Councils, extending the loan period in the Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act, 1869, from sixty to eighty years, and making the Secretary of State the Officer to administer the Schedule of the Act in London instead of the Local Government Board until such powers and duties are formally transferred. §2-LOCAL ACTS. London Connty Council (General Powers) Act, 1903, (3 Edwd. 7, ch. clxxxvii.) Horse Slaughter-houses, &c. Clause 53.—1 "From and after the passing of this Act it shall not be "lawful for any person to use any yard, building, or other premises "within the County for receiving or keeping horses for slaughter or "the carcases of dead horses unless he shall hold a license from the "(County) Council to use such yard, building, or other premises for "that purpose. (2) " The (County) Council may grant such licences subject to such "conditions as they may think fit, and every such licence shall be "subject to the provisions relating to granting and otherwise for the "time being in force with respect to licences for keeping or using "premises within the County as a slaughter-house or knacker's yard. "Provided that no licence under this Section shall extend to entitle "the holder to carry on upon the premises in respect of which the "same shall have been granted the business of a slaughterer of "horses or knacker, but the provisions of this Section shall not bo "construed or deemed to prejudice or affect the right of any person "for the time being lawfully carrying on any of such last-mentioned "businesses to use under a licence from the (County) Council and "subject to the provisions of the 'Public Health (London) Act, "1891,' premises in the County as a slaughter-house or knacker's "yard. (3) "Any person contravening the provisions of this Section or any of the "conditions subject to which his licence shall have been granted, "shall be liable on conviction to a penalty of not exceeding fifty "pounds for every such offence, and to a further penalty of not "exceeding fifty pounds for every day during which such offence "shall continue after conviction thereof." 103 Clause 54.—"From and after the passing of this Act it shall be lawful "for the (County) Council to make, vary, and amend by-laws with "respect to the mode of conveying the carcases of dead horses through "and along public streets in the County. "Such by-laws shall be subject to the provisions of 'The Metropolis "Management Act, 1855,' respecting the making, confirmation, "approval, publication, and evidence of by-laws; but the said pro"visions shall for the purposes of this Act be read and construed as "if the Local Government Board were named therein instead of one "of His Majesty's principal Secretaries of State." Clause 55 —"Subject to the provisions of this Act the by-laws referred "to in the last preceding Section of this Act may be enforced by the "Council of the Metropolitan Borough in which any breach of any "such by-law shall be committed, and the provisions of the said " 'Metropolis Management Act, 1855,' respecting proceedings under "any such by-laws sliall apply to such enforcement. "Provided always that the (County) Council on it being proved to their "satisfaction that the Council of any Metropolitan Borough has "made default in the enforcement of any such by-law may institute "any proceeding and do any act which such Council might have "instituted or done for that purpose, and shall be entitled to recover "from the Council of the Metropolitan Borough in default all such "expenses in and about the said proceeding or act as the Council "incur, and are not recovered from an)' other person, and have not "been incurred in any unsuccessful proceeding. §3—ORDERS. Cremation Act, 1902; Section 7. Under this Section the Home Secretary, on the 30th March, 1903, issued regulations as to crematoria and cremations (Statutorv Rules and Orders, 1903, No. 286). FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. Sanitary Accommodation. The Sanitary Accommodation Order, August, 1902. In pursuance of Section 9 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, I hereby determine that the accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences provided in a factory or workshop shall be deemed to be sufficient and suitable within the meaning of the said section if the following conditions are complied "with and not otherwise:— (1) In factories or workshops where females are employed or in attendance there shall be one sanitary convenience for every 25 females. (2) In factories or workshops where males are employed or in attendance there shall be one sanitary convenience for every 25 males: provided that— 104 (a) in factories or workshops where the number of males employed or in attendance exceeds 100, and sufficient urinal accommodation is also provided, it shall he sufficient if there is one sanitary convenience for every 25 males up to the first 100, and one for every 40 after; (b) in factories or workshops where the number of males employed or in attendance exceeds 500, and the District Inspector of Factories certifies in writing that by means of a check system, or otherwise, proper supervision and control in regard to the use of the conveniences are exercised by officers specially appointed for that purpose it shall be sufficient if one sanitary convenience is provided for every 60 males, in addition to sufficient urinal accommodation.

A. W. Fitzroy. Circular. Sanitary Authorities. Order of Council declaring Carbolic Acid a Poison. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S W. 10th January, 1901. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to enclose a copy of an Order made by the Lords of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council approving a Resolution passed by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain that liquid preparations of Carbolic Acid and its homologues containing more than three per cent, of those substances should, except in certain cases connected with agriculture and horticulture, be deemed poisons within the meaning of the Pharmacy Act, 1868, and the Second Part of Schedule A to that Act. 108 The Board have reason to believe that, in a very large number of cases where, local authorities disinfect or procure the defection of premises and things which have been exposed to infection, the disinfectant employed is Carbolic Acid. They desire to take this opportunity therefore, of pointing out that whenever the disinfectant employed is Carbolic Acid, or any other poision within the meaning of the Pharmacy Act, 1868, only bottles similar to those prescribed by the Regulations adopted by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and approved by an Order of the Lords of the Council, dated the 31st January, 1899, should be used to contain it. A copy of the last-mentioned Order is also enclosed. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, S. B. Provis, Secretary. To the Town Clerk. §6. LEGAL DECISIONS. Having regard to the question that so often occurs whether cutting off one drain from another converts a remaining unordered combined drain or sewer into a drain, the following decision is definite and clear:— Vestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, v. Phelan (L.R. 1896 1.9.B 533, 74 L.J. 285, 65 L.J.M.C. 111). This case of the Yestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, v. Phelan has not been overruled by any subsequent decision. In delivering judgment in this case, Mr. Justice Day said— "It appears from the facts that the pipe in question did at one time take the drainage of two houses, and there was no evidence of any sanction by the Local Authority so as to constitute a combined operation within Section 250, and so make the pipe a drain. Hence at one time this pipe was a sewer and consequently vested in the Parish Authorities, who had to keep it in repair. This burden they did not discharge, and whilst it was out of repair it was allowed to constitute a nuisance. While an attempt was being made to get the nuisance abated, an arrangement was made that the owner of one house (No. 36) should dispose of Lis sewage in some other way. This he did and cut off his drainage system from that of No. 42, the other house. The Vestry say this pipe is no longer a sewer it has become a drain, and the obligation to repair it is on the owner and not on us." In concluding, the learned Judge says:—"In my judgment, once a sewer always a sewer if used for the purpose of carrying drainage. I am led to this conclusion from the words of the Act of Parliament, which provides for the vesting of all sewers made and to be made in the Vestry." Mr. Justice Wills concurred, and said:—"The vesting is the governing factor in the determination of this, and that provides that all sewers made and to be made shall be vested in the Vestry. Therefore, when this combined system came into existence the pipe vested in the Local Authority. They (the sewers) have vested in the Parish, and I think once and for all, I see no provision for vesting them in the owner if the other houses are taken away and I think express words are required to effect such an alteration." 109 Court of Appeal. April 7th, 1903. Before Yaughan "Williams, Stirling, and Mathew, L. JJ. Silles v. Fulham Borough Council. Metropolis Management Act, 1855, Section 250.—Sewer.—Drain. Where the rainwater of two houses is drained into the same pipe as drains the sewage of one of the houses, that pipe becomes in consequence a sewer.—Holland v. Lazarus, 66, L. J. Q. B. 85, affirmed. This was an appeal from a decision of Wright, J., in an action brought by the owner of two houses against the Fulham Borougli Council, to recover a sum of money expended by him in abating a nuisance which had arisen in an underground pipe. The money had been expended by him on a threat of proceedings by the Borough Council. The question in issue was whether the pipe was a drain or sewer. The plaintiff contended that it was a sewer, and that the defendant Council should have done the work. The determination of the question depended on the interpretation of the word " drain " in Section 250 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855 (18 & 19 Vict., C. 120), which provides as follows :—" The word ' drain ' shall mean and include any drain of and used for the drainage of one building only, or premises within the same curtilage, and made merely for the purpose of communicating with a cesspool or other like receptacle for drainage, or with a sewer into which the drainage of two or more buildings or premises occupied by different persons is conveyed, and shall also include any drain for draining any group or block of houses by a combined operation under the order of any vestry or district board ; and the word ' sewer ' shall mean and include sewers and drains of every description except drains to which the word ' drain' interpreted as aforesaid, applies." In this case the two houses were built in one block, and had a gutter running along under the eaves, which carried a portion of the rain-water from the roofs of both houses into a down-pipe, into which also flowed the slops and bathwater of one of the houses. The down-pipe discharged into a gully, and from thence into the pipe in question, which communicated with a main sewer. Wright, J., on the authority of Holland v. Lazarus, 66 L. J. Q. B. 85, held that the pipe was a sewer, and gave judgement for the plaintiff. On appeal it was contended that that case was wrongly decided. Green v. St. Mary, JNewington (1898) 2 Q.B. 1, was referred to. Mattinson, K.C., and L M. Richards appeared for the plaintiff ; Macaskie, K.C., and Sylvian Mayer for the defendants. The Court without calling upon counsel for the plaintiff, dismissed the appeal. Lord Justice Yaughan Williams said that it was admitted that the facts in this case were substantially identical with the facts in the two cases of Holland v. Lazarus, decided by Mr. Justice Bruce, and Green v. Yestry of St. Mary, Newington, decided by the Divisional Court. It was held in those cases that where there were two drains carrying sewage matter, which ran into one another and served two buildings and not a block of houses drained by a combined operation sanctioned by the vestry, those two drains so running into one another came to be a sewer within the meaning of the definition of "sewer" in Section 250 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. And it was further established that it made no difference if one of the two drains happened to be a drain which only carried rain-water; such a case came equally within the definition. These cases he considered to be rightly decided. Stirling and Matthew, L. JJ., concurred. 110 Court of Appeal. March 18th, 1903. Before Yaughan Williams, Stirling, and Mathew, L. JJ. Prcctor v. Metropolitan Borough of Islington. Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 3.—Notice on Owner—Drain— Sewer—Liability of Borough Council to Owner. Where an inspector of nuisances of a Metropolitan Borough Council served an intimation notice upon an Owner of premises under Section 3 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and requested the owner to abate a nuisance in a drain, and the owner did so, and towards the completion of the work it was found that the pipe in question was a sewer, it was held that the owner could recover from the Council the expenses properly incurred in abating the nuisance. This was an action to recover a sum of £71 spent by the plaintiff in abating a nuisance served by an inspector of nuisances of the defendant Council pursuant to Section 3 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The defendant had done the work required by the notice, but towards its completion it was found that the pipe in connection with which the work had been mainly done was a sewer and not a drain. The plaintiff claimed a return of the money so expended by her on the ground that it was the duty of the Council to have done the work, and that she at the Council's request, and under compulsion, had done work which the Council were legally liable and compellable to do. The Council contended that the notice in question was not a request by them, but a notice served as required by statute, and further, that the plaintiff was not bound to obey it. They also contended that the plaintiff had done other work than was necessary. Wright, J., who tried the case, decided in favour of the defendants, on the ground that the notice was an intimation which the plaintiff was not bound to obey, and that therefore she was not compelled to do the work. On appeal, the plaintiff appeared in person, and Courthope Munroe appeared for the defendants. The court allowed the appeal on the ground that the plaintiff had been compelled to incur expense which ought to have been borne by the local authority. No formal judgment was delivered, but the court intimated that they thought there had been sufficient legal compulsion by the Council, as the inspector was the Council's servant, and the notice stated that if default was made in complying with it a statutory notice would be served, and the costs of so doing recovered. By consent of the parties the court assessed the amount due for work done on the sewer at £40, and gave judgment for that sum with -costs of the action, but not of the appeal. King's Bench Divisional Court. 4th February, 1904. Before Lord Chief Justice Alverstone, Mr. Justice Wills, and Mr. Justice Kennedy. Treasure & Son v. Bermondsey Borough Council. Judgment. The Lord Chief Justice:—"I am very anxious indeed to repeat what I have said more than once when giving Judgment with regard to these 1ll by-laws, that I decline to be a party to a Judgment which would suppose that we have expressed an opinion upon the merits of any particular sanitary, engineering, building or other question. One cannot of course shut one's eyes to what is common knowledge that there have been questions raised as to the desirability of draining in a particular way, or building in a particular way, or engineering in a particular way when it is a known common thing, and one cannot be ignorant of the fact that there has been a very considerable controversy as to whether it is desirable to have traps which themselves may become foul below each basin, or desirable to have something which could be readily cleaned out, but I absolutely decline to express the slightest opinion as to which is the best. All I say is that there is much to be said on both sides. But I come back to the point. We have had repeatedly on several occasions to say, in construing these by-laws, that if a local authority who have the right to do it and the duty of exercising a discretion, do wish to indicate that the thing is to be done, they must say so in fairly plain and clear language. I do not think that any Judgment to which I have been a party, certainly I have never, intentionally construed these by-laws unfavourably to the Local Authority by putting a strained construction upon them, but I have, where I supported them and where I have thought they could not be supported, endeavoured to point out that the language must be reasonably clear. " Let us take this and read it without assuming the absurdity of the one contention or the other, either 011 Mr. Macmorran's side or Mr. Avory's side. The statement is that a person who shall erect a new building shall cause every pipe in such building for carrying off waste water from every lavatory or sink to a sewer to be constructed in a certain way. Now the class of pipe they are speaking of there is a pipe which leads from the lavatory, and for this purpose I will take that to be from a basin in a lavatory to the sewer. If they mean by that, you must not take the water from the basin into the sewer by any other means except a pipe, they must say so, it is nothing unreasonable to ask them to say so, they must indicate it. Mr. Avory, who always touches the point, said that that was the construction he sought to put upon the by-law that this was a prohibition against taking the waste water away in any other method. Now, that I am not putting a false construction upon this bye-law is clear from the last paragraph of the same by-law. ' He shall cause every pipe in such building for carrying off waste water to a sewer to be taken through an external wall.' Therefore it is quite clear that they knew perfectly well what they were talking about, they were talking about pipes which led to the sewer from the lavatory, or if you like, from the basin, and while I perfectly agree with the criticisms my brother Wills has pointed out that the ordinary reader would take this to mean from the lavatory, and not from each basin, yet still I think what is far more important is that even if you take it from each basin, they have not told the people that they are not to use an open trough, but they have told the people that if they do use a pipe to the sewer it must be of a particular construction. Now, in this case I think to say that a short end of pipe which runs into an open trough, which open trough leads into a pipe, to call that a pipe leading to a sewer would be simply an abuse of language. Of course it is a pipe which takes the waste water to the sewer in the same sense that the housemaid may take the waste water into a sewer when she empties the basin into the slop pail, and pours the contents of the slop pail down a water closet or sink. No reasonable man reading that by-law would understand he was told you are not to be allowed to use the system of having 112 no closed pipe at all, but an open trough which can be cleaned out every day if you like, and to have no possibility of any foul connection between the open trough and that basin, by simply having a short length of pipe open, but you must use a closed pipe with the elaborate system suggested as the alternative. " I repeat I express no opinion as to which is the best, I do not know, but all I say is, that if the local authority desire to say our sanitary regulation shall be such that there shall always be a pipe from each basin to a sewer trapped in this way, they must say so. They are not entitled by describing how such a pipe is to be constructed and trapped to read into that a prohibition, that nobody shall do it in any other way. " I am therefore clearly of opinion that the Magistrate came to a wrong decision in this case, and that what was done here was not within the words of this by-law, construing it in the most liberal way in order to carry out the views of the Sanitary Authority." Mr. Justice Wills.—" I am of the same opinion, and for the same reasons." Mr. Justice Kennedy.—"I am of the same opinion, though I confess not quite with the same confidence, and therefore I will just add that it seems to me that the view which my Lord, and my brother Wills have adopted, and have expressed is the right one here, because I do not think that while it is necessary not to be hypercritical of language in matters that after all conducted by Officials aud Public Bodies, who must bo presumed to be sensible and just minded persons, on the other hand it is equally necessary to do justice to those about them, and my objection to the decision of the Magistrate mainly is this, that while I confess for myself I cannot regard as a matter of fair construction and grammatical rendering, the construction that Mr. Avory put upon this as altogether an impossible one. I think before persons are brought before Magistrates for the breach of a by-law of this kind it ought to be made not merely inferentially possible, but absolutely clear as a matter of ordinary construction of language that they have done something which is forbidden. Here the most Mr. Avory can put upon the construction of this by-law is that it ought to be a matter of inference that the only connection from each of these basins to a sewer should be a pipe, and not a pipe plus trough. I do not think that you ought to convict a person on inference, and I do not think that it is desirable to encourage such kind of legislation by by-law as will make it even arguably possible that the thing which has been done is not the thing which is forbidden in the by-law. I agree therefore entirely with the Judgment which has been pronounced." Mr. MacMorran.—" My Lord, the Appeal will be allowed with costs." The Lord Chief Justice. —" Yes." Mr. MacMorran.—" If your Lordship pleases." 113 King's Bench Divisional Court.—Wednesday, 9th December, 1903. Before The Lord Chief Justice of England, Mr. Justice Lawrence, and Mr. Justice Kennedy. Nokes and Another v. The Mayor, &c., of Islington. By-law of L.C.C. under Sec. 39 (and 16), P.H.L.A., 1891—Lodging House— Water-closet Accommodation—Notice Before Proceeding. Judgment. The Lord Chief Justice : I think the objection taken to this by-law by Mr. Woodfia in the way he has stated it is a good objection. In reply he summarized his argument very concisely and neatly by stating that it was objected before the Magistrate that the by-law was unreasonable, because in the analogous circumstances under Section 37 it is contemplated that the Sanitary Authority shall give a specific notice ; that this by-law contemplates none, and therefore, the by-law is unreasonable. I think in substance that is a good objection. I have no doubt whatever as to the power of the County Council to make these by-laws, I think the point taken by Mr. Woodfia originally that this must be regarded as a lodging house notice, and that inasmuch as lodging house water-closet accommodation is not governed by Section 94 this lodging house by-law for providing water-closets is bad, is not a good point. I agree with Mr. Courthope-Munroe's argument that Section 39 is a re-enactment with some amendment of the old provisions which now puts upon the County Council the duty which was previously put upon certain other local authorities. I think, therefore, that under Section 39 this is quite within that section. That these sanitary powers onght to be construed liberally we have often pointed out. It is competent to the County Council to make an order in connection with the water-closet by-laws that there shall be what they think at any rate a right and proper minimum of water-closet accommodation in respect of any tenement or any class of tenement, but that does not decide the question for reasons which I think will appear to be obvious. Sub-section 3 of Section 39 imposes the duty upon the Sanitary Authority of observing and enforcing the by-laws under this section. The by-laws themselves contemplate that any person who offends against one of the by-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of £5. This case illustrates the importance of there being some notice given to the person complained of. Nokes and Nokes collected the rent which Gates paid, and I agree with the argument of Mr. Courthope-Munroe that having regard to Section 100 they ought to be treated as standing in the position of their clients ; there is no doubt about that. On the other hand Gates is the responsible person for allowing more than the 12 persons to be in the house with one water-closet. Therefore, it is a case in which injustice may be done if proceedings are taken against people who may have partly parted or wholly parted with the control of their premises, unless some knowledge is given to them before proceedings are taken, because they may attempt to put pressure, as they did here, or more pressure on their tenant to reduce the number. But why I think the by-law which does not contemplate any notice being given to the landlord or owner before he is proceeded against for a penalty is bad, 114 is because that I find in Section 37 (the Sanitary Authority being the persons who are to say what is the minimum number of water-closets which according to the circumstances are to be required), and the Sanitary Authority being the persons who have power with regard to any house whether built before or after the commencement of the Act to say what is sufficient water-closet accommodation for a given number of people, and who have to give a statutory notice calling upon the landlord or owner to provide that the terms of the section shall be carried out, and that if not he shall be liable to a penalty of £5, it contemplates that the Local Authority shall give notice to the landlord or owner before proceedings are taken. I think, therefore this objection to a by-law which imposes a penalty for a breach of it, especially when you remember it is intended to be put in force against people who are not in fact owners but put in the position of owners, is a good one, and that there should be the same kind of notice given to them before proceedings are taken as is contemplated by Section 37. I think, therefore, this by-law which provides that proceedings may be taken and that the landlord shall provide, and does not make provision for a notice to be given before proceedings are taken is not a reasonable by-law. Mr. Justice Lawrence : I agree. Mr. Justice Kennedy: I only wish to say what, of course, my Lord intended, that the by-law is bad taking Section 26 in the respect which my Lord has pointed out in a judgment in which I entirely concur, because it must be read with Section 28 under which the proceedings are taken. The by-law indicates something which is to be done, and Section 28 says with regard to that—that if it refers to the other by-laws —if there is a breach of them, then it shall be treated as an offence, and penalties may be inflicted both for the breach and also for its continuance if continued. Mr. Courthope-Munroe : My Lord, then as regards the costs. You see we did in fact give notice. The Lord Chief Justice : No. Mr. Courthope-Munroe : We were really enforcing the by-law as it stood. The Lord Chief Justice : No. We have indicated that the matter can be cured perfectly easily. The notice you gave is not the proper kind of notice. Mr. Courthope-Munroe : No doubt the London County Council will make a new by-law. The Lord Chief Justice : It is quite easy to put something into a by-law provided that if the owner upon having proper notice shall not do what is requested, that then he shall be liable to a penalty. I do not see why the usual consequences should not follow. Mr. Courthope-Munroe : We did in fact give notice. Your Lordship is now holding that the by-law is bad because it did not contain an obligation to give a notice. We in fact did give a notice. The Lord Chief Justice : You gave an intimation in which you said that if it was not obeyed the statutory provisions would be put in force. Mr. Courthope-Munroe : We gave that on the 27th April. 115 The Lord Chief Justice : I know that, but I do not see why the usual order should not follow. The point has to be determined. Mr. Courthope-Munroe : It has to be determined by somebody, but it is unfortunate that it should be at the expense of Islington. Mr. Woodfia : Your Lordship includes the costs of the hearing before the " magistrates. The Lord Chief Justice : No. I only give you the costs of the appeal. Mr. Woodfia : I ask your Lordship for the costs of the proceedings before the magistrate. The Lord Chief Justice : No, you are not entitled to that. Mr. Woodfia : If your Lordship pleases. The County Council are considering the question of the general amendment of the by-laws made under Section 39 (and Section 16) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, but desire at once to repeal by-law 26, and to substitute an amended by-law, a copy of which is appended to their circular letter of the 29th February, 1904. By by-law 26 it is required that— " The landlord or owner of any lodging-house shall provide and maintain, in connection with such house, water-closet, earth-closet, or privy accommodation in the proportion of not less than one water-closet, earth-closet, or privy for every twelve persons." The County Council propose to add the words— " Provided that the landlord or owner of any lodgiug-house shall not deemed to have offended against the last-mentioned requirement of this by-law until the Sanitary Authority shall have caused notice to be served on such landlord or owner requiring him forthwith, or within such reasonable time as may be specified in the notice, to provide and maintain, in connection with such house, water-closet, earth-closet, or privy accommodation in the proportion as aforesaid, and he shall have failed to comply with the notice." The Borough Council's by-laws for Houses let in Lodgings contains a similar by-law to that made by the County Council in regard to the number of waterclosets in proportion to the number of inmates, and also contains the following by-law as to penalties and previous notice : — 16.—Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing by-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority. Provided that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceeding may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this by-law. It would therefore appear to be unnecessary for the by-laws of St. Pancras to be altered. 116 VII— REPORTS OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1903.
