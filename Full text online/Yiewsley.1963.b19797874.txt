Drayton Hall, West Drayton, Middlesex. October, 1964. To The Chairman and Members of the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District Council. Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen. I have the honour to submit my report of the Health of the District for the year 1963. The health of the district on the whole has been good. Coronary disease was again the principal cause of death during the year. Malignant Disease of the lung and Bronchitis combined were a close second. It is gratifying to record that there were no deaths from Tuberculosis. There were approximately 20 times more cases of Measles notified than all the other Infectious Diseases combined. I would like to add my tribute to Dr. P. M J Bobbett who retired during the year after 24 years sterling service to the Council and hope he will enjoy many years of well-earned leisure. My sincere thanks are due to Mr. Makin, Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. Marshall, his Deputy, the other Health Inspectors and the Staff of the Public Health Department for their help and co-operation during the year. It has indeed been a pleasure to work with them. Your obedient servant, L. F. KEENAN. Temporary Medical Officer of Health. 6 SECTION A Area in acres 5,276 Total population 1963 (midsummer) (estimated by the Registrar General) 24,190 Estimated number of inhabited dwellings 8,960 Rateable Value (31st March, 1963) 6/3d.

To The Chairman and Members of the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District Council. Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report for 1963. I must again apologise for the delay in producing it but I am sure you will appreciate that there have been many difficulties, not least, the pressure of work. You will observe from the Report that the department has been quite busy and I am grateful for the co-operation 1 have received from the Public Health and Housing Committees of the Council and from the staff of the department both inspectorial and clerical. I do not propose this year to make any specific comments on any aspect of the work of the department. I am, Your obedient servant, A. Makin, Chief Public Health Inspector. 14 SECTION D WATER SUPPLY Mains water was supplied by Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company. There are only 5 houses in the Urban District where the water supply is derived from wells. Several complaints were received about brown discolouration in mains water. This was found on investigation, to be coincidental with the flushing of water mains. The Water Company's attention was drawn to this matter and the cause stated to be due to the disturbing of rust sediment by mains flushing, abnormal consumption, use of fire hydrants and other factors. One hesitates to think what a housewife would say after using a fully automatic washing machine into which the discoloured water had entered. The Company's reaction to this is that the British Waterworks Association have been recommended to approach manufacturers to fit fillers to their machines. The recommendation to fit filters is given to consumers who make complaints direct to the Company. That we have water in practically all our houses, we are truly grateful, because some people in this country still, believe it or not, have to carry water from a well or village pump, and some unfortunates in other parts of the world have no water at all except that which falls from above occasionally If only we had softer water we would be truly, truly grateful. 15 91 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION Location Type Residual Chlorine p.p.m. Colonies per ml 2 days Colonies per ml 3 days Bad. coli (Type 1) Probable number per 100 ml Presumptive Colicerogenes Probable number per 100 ml West Drayton P.S.

As you will see by reference to the statistics much work has been done and in no case has legal action been necessary lo cnforce compliance with the law. The service has operated satisfactorily during the year under review and splendid co-operation by the general public continues. Complaints were received during the year concerning infestation of your tips by rats, this, despite constant surveillance which is exercised regularly. Prompt investigation and thorough action was undertaken to deal with the nuisance; this resulted in quick abatement It is worthy of note to mention that despite considerable disturbance of the Cherry Lane Tip by Contractors constructing the new motorway, there was no increase in the incidence of reported rat infestations of surrounding properties. As in the previous year, your sewers throughout the district were treated bi-annually by a specialist firm ; a most successful service. For some time now a proprietory poison has been in general use throughout the country with outstanding results. However, there are signs that resistance to this poison is appearing in the rodent population and the position is being watched very closely by all concerned This is just another reminder of the vigilance that must be maintained at all times in the war against the rat. Infestation control of the banks of the Duke of Northumberland river continues to operate satisfactorily; this work is undertaken on behalf of the Middlesex County Council.

All condemned meat was coloured with an approved dye and sent, by arrangement, to Smithfield Animal Products Ltd , for processing into fertilisers. My thanks are due to both the Director of the Pathological Laboratory at Hillingdon and the Director of the Ministry of Agriculture. Fisheries and Food Research Laboratory at Byfleet, whose services and help have been available when difficult diagnosis of disease has been encountered.

This programme was maintained in 1963 as Smoke Control Area No. 5 became operative on 1.12.63. Area No. 5, comprised 281 acres and was bounded on the North by Whitethorn Avenue, Laburnum Avenue and the northern boundary of Kingston Lane Playing Fields, thence easterly along the Urban District Boundary to its junction with Hayes and Harlington Urban District Boundary, thence southwards to Starveall Bridge, thence westerly to Horton Bridge Road, thence northwards along Horton Bridge Road to the junction of that read with Horton Road, thence westerly along Horton Road to Acacia Avenue, thence northerly along Acacia Avenue to its junction with Whitethorn Avenue, Yiewsley. The classification of properties in the area are as follows:— Area No. Industrial Commercial Dwelling« Others 5 24 3 244 - Private Houses Council Houses Grant Aided Non-Grant Aided Grant Aided Non-Grant Aided 32 — 180 32 33 LONDON AIRPORT The year that has passed represents the first full year of passenger handling in the Central Terminal Area, and one can already see the start of redevelopment work on the North Terminal Area. Two new Aircraft Kitchens are in the process of construction to take the place of existing kitchens which are both outdated and inadequate to cope with increased passenger handling. Routine inspections have been made throughout the year in all the catering premises but unfortunately in one case summonses had to be issued for contravention of the Food Hygiene Regulations. These were withdrawn following compliance with the regulations before the case should have been heard. Food inspection: The Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations 1937.48 were administered by your Staff and 152tons 12cwts. 2qrs. 12 lbs. of food imported into the Country from Austria, Germany, Australia. U.S.A. France, Holland, Czechoslovakia and Ireland were inspected. 509 inspections during the day and night were made. Details of the various foods inspected are as follows:— No. of Samples Confectionery and Flour Confectionery 1 4 3 1 Fresh Meat 41 2 3 18 Cooked Meat and Meat Products 14 19 1 13 Salami and Other Sausages 56 7 1 25 Fish 5 16 0 10 Shellfish 1 11 2 22 Fruit 7 8 3 24 Vegetables 3 9 0 23 Offal 1 1 17 Cheese 2 12 1 10 Butter 2 0 7 Miscellaneous 17 16 1 10 34 In addition to the above inspections, sampling of foodswas also carried out and the results are shown hereunder:— No. of Samples Taken Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Gypsy Pork Roast 36 16 20 Sausages 44 32 12 Fish in Aspic 1 — 1 Cooked Meats 29 17 12 Pate de fois 3 3 — Pastry 3 2 1 Mayonnaise 4 4 — Cheese 11 8 3 Lobster 2 1 1 Fresh Meat 2 2 — TOTALS 135 85 50 Drinking Water from Aircraft: 52 samples of drinking water were taken from Aircraft during the year and details of these are as follows:— Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Taken from fixed tank system 4 — Taken from portable flasks 17 — Taken from Bowsers 6 — Taken from Mains Water 6 — Taken from Siphons 19 — 52 - Petroleum Installations: There are four major petroleum storage depots, holding a total of 3,765,900 gallons of fuel, which were licensed for the year, and approval in principal has been given for a fifth major installation. Fumes and Noise from Aircraft: Complaints of fumes and particularly of noise from aircraft are still voiced loudly by complainants and although many high level meetings have taken place on this subject existing legislation does not seem to offer any remedy. 35 WEST DRAYTON PRINTING CO.
