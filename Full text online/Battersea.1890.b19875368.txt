Davies was appointed to take charge of the third key held by Mr. E. Wood, J.P., during the past year, and relinquished by that gentleman upon his retirement from the Vestry. Meetings of the Vestry. The Vestry have found it necessary to hold 44 Ordinary and Special Meetings during the year, in order to cope with the multitudinous matters coming under their jurisdiction, and a table, shewing the attendances of Members at these meetings, and also at meetings of the Committees of the Vestry, is inserted as an appendix to this report. (No. I.) The Works and General Purposes Committee The Works and General Purposes Committee, at their 26 meetings held during the year, have considered and submitted recommendations upon a large number of very important subjects, including many matters specially referred to them by the Vestry. The extent of the business transacted by this Committee may be gauged by their 15 22 reports submitted to the Vestry, containing no less than 336 recommendations, dealing with the various questions which they have had before them from time to time. These recommendations may be classified as follows, viz.:— No. of recommendations. Subjects. 17 Apportionments of costs of making up and paving of new streets. 26 Contracts and specifications for works and services and the supply of materials. 15 Drainage, gullies, sewerage, sewer tion, &c. 93 Erection of new buildings. 4 Formation of new streets. 16 Improvements. 16 Lamps and lighting. 3 Lines of frontage. 16 Making up of new streets. 76 Miscellaneous. 20 Paving carriage and footways. 9 Street naming and numbering. 6 Tramways. 2 Trees on footways. 17 Urinals. 336 In addition to the matters upon which the Works and General Purposes Committee reported to the Vestry they considered at each meeting reports and estimates submitted by the Surveyor relating to general small works and repairs in accordance with the authority conferred upon them by the Standing Orders of the Vestry and gave the necessary instructions as to the carrying out of such works and repairs. The Street Cleansing Dusting and Depot Committee The Street Cleansing Dusting and Depot Committee have held 37 protracted sittings during the year, and have submitted 28 reports to the Vestry upon the matters under their control and management containing 165 recommendations. 16 This Committee having to arrange and superintend the work connected with the cleansing of the 60 miles of streets under the jurisdiction of the Vestry, the collection and disposal of house refuse and the supervision of all matters connected with the Vestry's Stables, Dust Destructor, Dep6t and Wharf including the manufacture of silica and tar paving from the residue of house refuse after the same has been passed through the Dust Destructor, and also having the control of all stores and materials at such Depots, necessarily devote much time and attention to the enormous amount of detail and routine work relating to these matters, and the reports and recommendations submitted to the Vestry cannot be taken as an index of the work actually carried out by this Committee, especially having regard to the fact that the whole of the work of the Parish is now carried out by workmen directly employed by the Vestry under the supervision of the several Committees. During the year the Street Cleansing Dusting and Depot Committee have devoted considerable time and attention to the question of the collection and disposal of the dust and house refuse from premises within the Parish and a full report upon this subject in connection with the operations at the Vestry's Dust Destructor Dep6t will be found in the annual report of the Surveyor. (See Appendix No. III). The Sanitary Committee. The Sanitary Committee during the period under review have dealt with the matters relating to the sanitation of the Parish and the health of the inhabitants at 24 meetings, and have submitted to the Vestry 22 reports containing 129 recommendations thereon. This Committee at each meeting received and considered the reports of the Medical Officers of Health, the Inspector of Nuisances and the four Assistant Inspectors and gave directions as to the procedure of the respective officers in all cases of urgency; the Committee also examined the Register of Bodies taken to the Public Mortuary and the Register of the Notification of Infectious Diseases which are laid before them at each meeting. The Committee gave instructions to the Inspector as to 17 the purchase of samples of Food and Drugs for submission to the Public Analyst for analysis, received the report of and conferred with the Public Analyst upon the analysis of such samples and directed proceedings to be taken against the vendors of samples certified by the Public Analyst as adulterated. The Finance Committee The Finance Committee have held 23 meetings, and have submitted 22 reports relative to the financial transactions of the Vestry during the year. At each meeting all vouchers for payments ordered by the Vestry were submitted to and examined and checked by the Committee with the Bankers' Pass Book, and the Vestry's Cash Book ; the Committee also examined the Clerk's Cash Book, and Wages Sheets. All accounts passed for payment by the Works and General Purposes, the Street Cleansing Dusting and Depot, and the Sanitary Committees, were examined by the Finance Committee before being submitted to the Vestry for payment. This Committee also received, and considered, all applications relating to amounts due under Orders of Apportionment of the estimated cost of paving new streets, and the refunding of sums due to owners of property in respect of the excess of the estimated over the actual cost of paving new streets upon the completion of the work, and made recommendations to the Vestry, or gave instructions to the Clerk thereon as circumstances required. The Law and Parliamentary Committee The Law and Parliamentary Committee have found it necessary to meet 14 times during the year and have submitted 11 reports to the Vestry upon the several matters brought before them. 18 The decisions of the Vestry upon the following Parliamentary Bills, all of which received careful consideration by the Committee, were as under:— Title of the Bill. Decision of the Vestry. Bribery (Public Bodies) Prevention Bill That a petition be presented in favour. Horse Flesh (Sale for Food) Bill That no action be taken.

Smoke Nuisance Abatement (Metropolis) Bill That no action be taken. Theatres (County of Lon don) Bill j That a petition be presented against. 19 The Committee also conferred with and instructed the Solicitor relative to the conduct of the various legal proceedings. The Vestry considered the so-called Betterment Clauses contained in the London Streets (Strand Improvement) Bill, and addressed a communication to the London County Council thereon, to the effect that they were entirely in favour of the clauses, and urging the Council, pending general legislation on the subject, to incorporate similar provisions in Bills dealing with cases where the surrounding property is specially benefited by public improvements. The Vestry also considered and presented petitions against the London Subways and Overhead Wires Bill, promoted by the County Council, and the Richmond Footbridge, with removable sluices, Lock and Slipway Bill. Receipts and Expenditure. The Vestry have received from the Board of Churchwardens and Overseers the sum of £76,379 19s. 7d., paid pursuant to Precepts based upon the Annual Estimates of Expenditure of the Vestry. This amount included the following sums which the Vestry were required to raise and pay to the undermentioned bodies, viz.:— The Metropolitan Board of Works £6,853 8s. 7d. The School Board for London £24,794 2s. 7d. The amount received by the Vestry on account of private works carried out by the Vestry for and at the expense of owners of property, such as the making-up and paving of new streets, repairs to trenches cut by the Gas and Water Companies, drain connections, &c., was £9,424 5s. 6d., and from sundry other sources £5,121 15s. 9d., making the total receipts £90,926 os. 10d., while the total expenditure of the Vestry amounted to £96,767 1s. 5d. An abstract of the receipts and expenditure of the Vestry is appended to this report, pursuant to the provisions of the 198th section of the 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 12, (See Appendix No. VII.)

Conference— Delegates appointed to attend. Messrs. F. Higgs, H. Turnor, and A. Bridge were appointed by the Vestry to attend a conference convened by the Kensington Vestry, and held at the Town Hall, Kensington, on the 14th and 28th April, 1890, in re Precepts of the School Board for London, and those gentlemen subsequently submitted a report upon the deliberations of the Conference, which was duly considered by the Vestry. Deputations received by the Vestry. The Vestry received a Deputation of ratepayers on the 12th March, relative to the lighting of Wandsworth Common. This subject is referred to at length on page No. 33 of this report. Albert Bridge. The repairs to the Albert Bridge, which had been in hand during the greater part of the previous year, were completed under the supervision of the Engineer to the London County Council in the month of May, 1889. Battersea Bridge. The anticipations of the late Metropolitan Board of Works, that the new Battersea Bridge would be completed during the year 1889, were not realized, and the work is still in hand. The Vestry learn, however, that the County Council expect to open the bridge to the public in July, 1890. The necessary powers for the re-construction of this bridge were conferred upon the late Metropolitan Board of Works by the Metropolitan Bridges Act, 1881, and the length of time occupied by the work has caused great inconvenience to the inhabitants and manufacturers of the Parish, and has resulted in serious loss to the traders in Bridge Road, the bridge having been necessarily closed for vehicular traffic during the process of re-building. 22 Improvement of the West London Extension Railway Bridge, Latchmere Road. In the last Report the Vestry referred to the question of the improvement of the footbridge and the approaches thereto, over the railways of the West London Extension and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Companies at Culvert Road, and the widening and improvement of the West London Extension Railway Bridge over Latchmere Road, for which the necessary powers were obtained by the late Metropolitan Board of Works in their Various Powers Act of 1888. The Vestry are pleased to record that the widening and heightening of the railway bridge over Latchmere Road was put in hand in January, 1890, by the London County Council, and the work is making rapid progress. It is anticipated that a very large increase of traffic will take place along this road upon the completion of the improvement, when facilities will be afforded for the passage of vehicles by the additional headway under the new bridge. In connection with this improvement, the sewer passing under the bridge will be required to be laid at a lower level, consequent upon the lowering of the roadway, and the Vestry have arranged with the County Council to include in the Contract for this work a length of 210 feet of sewer, which it is also necessary to relay between Abercrombie Street and Sheepcote Lane, at the cost of the Vestry ; this portion of the sewer being entirely distinct from the portion which the Council require to alter. Footbridge Culvert Road. The Vestry regret that the improved footbridge over the West London Extension and the London Chatham and Dover Railways in Culvert Road has not yet been commenced. The County Council, are, however, acquiring the necessary property, and the Vestry have every reason to believe that this work will be proceeded with very shortly. 23 Proposed Widening of York Road, Battersea Park Road, Nine Elms Lane, and High Street Vauxhall. The Vestry at their meeting on the 24th April, further considered the question of the widening of York Road, Battersea Park Road, Nine Elms Lane, and High Street, Vauxhall, and on the 29th April a communication was addressed to the County Council again pointing out the urgent necessity of these improvements being carried out as speedily as possible. On the 18th June a further communication was addressed to the Council upon the subject, but the Vestry can only again express their extreme regret that the Council did not consider the question of improving these thoroughfares of sufficient importance to justify action in the matter. New Bridge by the Royal Masonic Institution forGirls, Wandsworth Common. The contract with Messrs. M. T. Shaw & Co., for the construction of a bridge for vehicular traffic over the railways by the Royal Masonic Institution for Girls, Wandsworth Common, reference to which was made in the last annual report of the Vestry, was completed and the bridge thrown open to the public on the 23rd December. Action by the Royal Masonic Institution for Girls, relative to new Bridge. During the construction of this bridge, a difference arose between the Vestry and the Governing Body of the Institution, as to the fixing of the face girder at the south-eastern corner of the bridge adjoining the schools, the House Committee of the Institution contending that the girder, if fixed as proposed, would prevent free access to the Institution. A writ of action was served upon the Vestry in the matter on the 9th September and on the nth September, an interim injunction was obtained restraining the Vestry from fixing the girder referred to. A specification and plan of works at the Lodge and entrance to the Institution which would, if executed by the Vestry, meet the objections raised by the House Committee, were received and considered by the Vestry on the 25th September. On the 2nd October the action for a continuance of the interim injunction came before Lord Justice Denman, who 24 intimated that, in his opinion, the case was one in which a compromise should be effected; but, as counsel stated they had no instructions which could form the basis of a settlement, the case was adjourned for hearing until Friday, 4th October. Meanwhile, negotiations were entered into with a view to a compromise, and, at a conference held on the 4th October, the following terms were agreed to, viz.:—The Vestry to pay the sum of £50 to the Institution, together with the costs incurred, upon condition that the School Authorities convey or grant perpetual license to the Vestry for the use of the piece of ground at the south-west abutment of the bridge, in order that the Vestry may build a pier thereon if necessary; also to allow the Vestry to have access to so much of their land as is necessary for the purpose of erecting such pier, and to forego all claims (if any) which they may have against the Vestry, on account of the raising of the levels of the roadway. An order was subsequently made by the Court which gave effect to these terms. Lombard Road and York Road Improvements. The Vestry having carried out the widening of Lombard Road at the junction with York Road, decided to dispose of the surplus land not required for the improvement by public tender. The tenders received were, however, considered in connection with a communication from the London County Council, stating that the Council required a site in the Parish for the erection of an office for Weights and Measures, and enquiring upon what terms the Vestry would be prepared to sell the land in question for that purpose ; negotiations were subsequently commenced with the Council which will doubtless lead to the purchase of the land by that body as a site for an office for Weights and Measures. Lombard Road, further improvement. The Vestry considered the question of the further improvement of Lombard Road by continuing that thoroughfare through the grounds of the Battersea Training College to Vicarage Road, so as to afford a direct means of communication between York Road and Battersea 25 Bridge, and resolved to take proceedings for acquiring the necessary lands under the provisions of the General Paving (Metropolis) Act, 1817. Negotiations were accordingly commenced but ultimately abandoned, the Vestry having resolved to take no further steps therein. Widening of Latchmere Road and Amies Street. With a view to the completion of the improvement of Latchmere Road and Amies Street, which thoroughfares are to be widened in front of the land belonging to the School Board for London, as mentioned in their last annual report, the Vestry on the 26th June, resolved to acquire under the provisions of the General Paving (Metropolis) Act, 1817, the piece of land projecting into Amies Street at the corner of Dorothy Road, and the necessary steps are now being taken in the matter. Northcote Road Extension. Reference was made in the last annual report to a communication addressed to the late Metropolitan Board of Works with a view to the acquirement of the necessary land for carrying out the extension of Northcote Road through to Chatham Road as a Metropolitan improvement, but the late Board then informed the Vestry that the communication reached the Board too late to admit of the question being considered in connection with an application to Parliament in the ensuing session for powers to effect the improvement. The Vestry have, however, had the matter constantly under their notice, and on the 22nd January, upon consideration of a letter from the Superintending Architect of the London County Council, inviting the suggestions of the Vestry upon an application for the formation of new streets upon the Bolingbroke Grove Estate between Bolingbroke Grove and Webb's Road, they decided to inform the Council that they had no objection to offer to the formation of the proposed new streets, but suggested that the Council should require the portions of the estate abutting upon the Bolingbroke Grove and Webb's Road to be given up to form part of those thoroughfares, and drew the attention of the Council to the extreme desirability of Northcote Road being continued 26 through and connected with Chatham Road over the existing line of the sewer vested in the Council, and requested the Council to refuse their consent to the erection of any buildings over the line of such sewer at the spot in question, it being proposed by the owners of the estate to form a new street in continuation of Northcote Road, but not to connect such new street with Chatham Road. The Vestry are pleased to state that the portions of the Bolingbroke Grove Estate abutting upon Bolingbroke Grove and Webb's Road respectively, which have been a great obstruction in those thoroughfares, will, in accordance with the requirements of the Council, be given up to form part of the respective highways. The Vestry on the 12th March instructed the Surveyor to prepare the necessary plans with a view to acquiring the property between the end of Northcote Road, as proposed to be continued through the Bolingbroke Grove Estate, and Chatham Road for the purpose of opening a direct route from Northcote Road to Nightingale Lane. Falcon Road Improvement. The Vestry on the 26th February, considered the question of widening Falcon Road between Lavender Road and No. 94, (Messrs. Hallet's Timber Yard.) Many complaints have been received of the exceedingly small space allotted to foot passengers on the west side of this road when the tradesmen's goods are displayed in front of their shops, and the Vestry decided to acquire compulsorily the forecourts of these premises for the purpose of improving the thoroughfare, and proceedings with this object are now in progress. Plough Road Improvement. The School Board for London having agreed to surrender a strip of land extending the whole length of the frontage of the School premises in Plough Road and Plough Terrace, now in course of erection, for the purpose of widening the highway, the Vestry, in view of the increase of traffic along Plough Road, consequent upon the opening of the new bridge by the Royal Masonic Institution for Girls, Wandsworth Common, which affords direct means of 27 communication for vehicular traffic between Plough Road, St. John's Hill and Bolingbroke Grove, and the large number of children who will attend the new Board Schools when completed, resolved on the 10th July to complete the improvement and to acquire under the provisions of the General Paving (Metropolis) Act, 1817, 57 Geo. III., cap. 29, a strip of land adjoining Mr. Butter's premises at the south corner of Plough Road, and also land on the eastern side of that road, including the forecourts of Nos. 117 and 119, which have for so many years caused a serious obstruction to pedestrian traffic, and the Vestry hope to complete this desirable improvement during the ensuing year. Sheepcote Lane Improvement. As the result of a conference between the Works and General Purposes Committee and the Commissioners for Public Baths and Washhouses for this Parish, the road in front of the Baths in Sheepcote Lane has been widened to 40-ft., the Vestry paying the Commissioners the sum of £170 for the land required to effect this improvement. In connection with this matter the Vestry at their meeting on the nth September, ordered that the necessary steps should be taken for the purpose of acquiring under the provisions of the General Paving (Metropolis) Act, 1817, 57 Geo. III., cap. 29, the requisite land for continuing the widening of this road to 40-ft. in front of the Allotment Grounds. In reply to the Statutory notices served by the Vestry, the Board of Churchwardens and Overseers, as Trustees for the Latchmere Allotments, stated that they were prepared to surrender the necessary land for the sum of £500, upon the understanding that the work of making-up and paving the road should be executed at the expense of the Vestry, and on the 27th November these terms were accepted by the Vestry. The Vestry further resolved on the 12th February, with a view to the completion of the widening of Sheepcote Lane, between Latchmere Road and Culvert Road, to acquire under the Act the necessary land and buildings between the Allotments and the latter road, and Statutory notices have been served upon the owners of the property affected. 28 Communication between the Queen's Road, the Beaufoy, the Shaftesbury Park, and the Latchmere Grove Estates. The Vestry on the 8th May appointed a Special Committee consisting of twelve members to consider and report as to the best means of establishing communication between the Queen's Road, the Beaufoy, the Shaftesbury Park, and the Latchmere Grove Estates; but at the close of the period covered by this Report the Committee had not come to a final conclusion upon the reference. Culvert Road Archway. On the 7th March, 1889, the Vestry received a communication from the Coroner for Westminster to the effect that a lad named T. Cutting had recently died in St. George's Hospital from injuries received by being crushed between the wall of the railway arch in Culvert Road and a passing vehicle. The subject of this narrow and dangerous archway had been on several occasions before the Vestry and as a temporary measure the Vestry ordered on the 10th April that the footpath on the western side of the railway arches be abolished, the existing kerb be placed close to the walls of the arch, and a slope formed thereon in cement to prevent the same being used by the public, and that the footpath on the eastern side of the roadway passing under the arches be widened as far as possible, after allowing for a sufficient width for vehicular traffic ; and with a view to prevent further accidents to persons passing under the arch, that the Railway Companies should be requested to give their consent to the formation of a subway, or to construct the same on the eastern side of the archway in question for the use of foot-passengers, the work to be carried out at the cost of the Vestry. Communications were addressed to the London, Brighton and South Coast and the London and South Western Railway Companies accordingly, and on the 19th November a letter was received from the London and South Western Railway Company in reply, to the effect that certain widenings of the railway were contemplated in Battersea which might affect Culvert Road and for which the necessary powers would be sought in the ensuing Session of Parliament, and that in view of this they were not able to give the proposal any further 29 consideration. The matter was therefore deferred, but the Vestry decided to endeavour to obtain the insertion of a clause to provide for this improvement so far as related to the arch of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company in the Bill promoted by that Company, and to take a similar course with the London and South Western Railway Company when the next application to Parliament is made by that Company for further powers. Re-naming and renumbering Streets. During the period under review, the London County Council, with the concurrence of the Vestry, made an order for the re-naming of the thoroughfare on the north side of Clapham Common" Clapham Common North Side," and for the re-numbering of the houses. Cross Street was re-named "Ascalon Street," and the houses renumbered ; Beauchamp Road was incorporated with Bleisho Road, and the houses in both roads re-numbered ; John Street, (York Road), and Nottingham Road were re-numbered. New Streets Orders ot apportionment The Vestry made the necessary orders for the apportionment upon the owners of the property adjoining, of the costs or expenses of making-up and paving the following new streets:— Beechmore Road Mossbury Road. Broomwood Road. Robertson Street West (additional). Eckstein Road. Silverthorne Road (additional). Harroway Road. Stewart's Lane West. Holman Road. Wroughton Road. Latchmere Grove. New Streets made-up and paved. The following is a list of new streets which were made-up and paved during the year by workmen directly employed by the Vestry under the supervision of the Surveyor:— Beechmore Road Lavender Gardens Burland Road Marney Road Chatto Road Mossbury Road Comyn Road Prince of Wales' Road Dulka Road Severus Road Eckstein Road Sugden Road Forfar Road Warriner Gardens 30 New Streets— Apportionment charges. The Vestry reconsidered the question of the collection of amounts under Orders of Apportionment of the cost of paving New Streets, and having regard to the fact that all new streets are now formed and made up by workmen directly employed by the Vestry, under the supervision of the Surveyor, and that the Vestry are consequently required to make prompt payments for labour and materials, and that the General Rate Funds cannot be applied to the execution of private works, directed that in future the making up and paving of new streets be not proceeded with until three-fourths of the amounts due under such orders of apportionment have been actually received. Trees on Footways. The Vestry gave directions to the Surveyor, in the making-up of new streets, that in future no trees should be allowed to remain therein unless protected with substantial iron guards, provided by the respective owners ; and the Surveyor was instructed to call upon the owners of adjoining premises where trees, or guards thereto, in the public streets, are broken, to replace such trees or guards, and, in default, to remove the same. New Streets excess refunded. The excess of the estimated over the actual cost of making up the undermentioned new streets was refunded to the respective owners of property:— Andoe Road Froude Street Ashness Road Grandison Road Burland Road Leathwaite Road Chatto Road Marney Road Comyn Road Sugden Road Dulka Road Swaby Road Estcourt Road Thurleigh Road Contractor fined for delay in making-up new streets. The last contract entered into by the Vestry for the making-up and paving of new streets (Estcourt and Thurleigh Roads), had a very unsatisfactory termination, the contractors having greatly exceeded the stipulated time, the Vestry under the provisions of the contract imposed a fine of £15 os. od.—£7 10s. od. in respect of each road. 31 Making up of Roadway between Chivalry Road and Bolingbroke Grove Attention having been drawn by the residents to the condition of the short piece of roadway between Chivalry Road and Bolingbroke Grove, which belongs to, and is maintainable by the London County Council, as successors to the Conservators of Wandsworth Common, the Vestry, upon the application of the Council, agreed to make up the road in a similar manner to the adjacent roads, upon payment by the Council of the sum of £205, and also to maintain the road in a proper state of repair for the sum of £10 per annum. On the 17th January the Council agreed to these terms, and the work will be put in hand upon receipt of the stipulated sum. John Street York Road, Maintenance, &c. In accordance with an arrangement made between the Vestry and the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District, the County Council, upon the application of that Board, issued an Order placing John Street, situate partly in this parish and partly within the Parish of Wandsworth, under the exclusive management of the District Board, for the purposes of sewerage, drainage, paving, lighting, watering, cleansing, repair and maintenance, the Vestry paying to that Board one half the costs and expenses of and incidental to such works. Christchurch Garden. The Vestry having undertaken the management and maintenance of the garden in front of Christ Church, Battersea Park Road, the land having been duly conveyed to the Vestry, constructed an entrance to the ground from Cabul Road by the formation of a brick pier and gate to the second tier of railings westward from the carriage gates; a footpath was also formed on the east side of the garden to connect the existing paths and the whole of the paths were tar paved. New Buildings. During the year the Vestry have received and considered notices for the erection of 289 new buildings. New Sewers. Plans were submitted to the Vestry for the construction of sewers in the undermentioned new Streets, and the same having been provisionally approved were 32 duly forwarded to the Council for the approval of that body, pursuant to the provisions of the 25 and 26 Vic., cap. 102, sec. 48, viz.:— Chatham Terrace (in continuation.) Bramfield Road. Kelmscott Road. Northcote Road (in continuation.) Cupar Road. Lurline Gardens (in continuation.) Macduff Road. Old Park Avenue. The whole of these sewers were subsequently sanctioned by the Council, who also approved plans submitted by the Vestry for the sewerage of Sheepcote Lane and Victoria Circus. Tramway defects. In May a report was presented to the Works and General Purposes Committee by the Surveyor, upon the unsatisfactory and dangerous condition of the tramways throughout the Parish, and the Vestry, acting upon a recommendation of the Committee, directed that the attention of the South London Tramways Company be drawn to the matter, and that they be required to put the lines in a proper state of repair forthwith. The Company having replied that they were advised that the lines were in a good condition generally, a notice to remedy the defects, accompanied by a schedule of such defects, was by order of the Vestry on the 24th July, served upon the Secretary of the Company. Upon a further report by the Surveyor to the effect that the defects had not been remedied, the Vestry resolved, on the 8th January, to engage Mr. J. Kincaid, M.I.C.E., to inspect the lines and report thereon, with a view to an independent confirmation of the report of the Surveyor preparatory to taking the necessary proceedings to enforce compliance with the requirements of the Vestry. 33 This report, which fully supports that made by the Surveyor, has been received, but the Tramways Company have now remedied some of the most serious defects ; at the close of the year the Works and General Purposes Committee still had the matter under their consideration. Lighting of footpaths on Wandsworth Common. The Vestry considered the question of lighting the paths crossing Wandsworth Common, and at their meeting on the 18th December, it was resolved to request the County Council, who have succeeded to the duties and responsibilities of the Metropolitan Board of Works with regard to the Common, to light the paths where necessary. A deputation attended the Vestry on the 12th March and submitted resolutions passed at a public meeting of ratepayers held at St. Michael's School Rooms, Bolingbroke Grove, and Mr. F. Higgs, Chairman of the Meeting, addressed the Vestry, urging that the paths referred to should be lighted. The Deputation were informed of the action which the Vestry had taken in the matter. The decision of the Council has not yet been communicated to the Vestry. Maintenance of main roads under the Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act, 1878. The Vestry on the 27th March considered a report of the Works and General Purposes Committee as to the roads which should in their opinion be declared main roads under the provisions of the Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act, 1878, and the Local Government (England and Wales) Act, 1888, and the following list was submitted to the County Council on the 5th April with a request that the roads mentioned therein should be declared main roads, under the provisions of the Acts in question and with a view to the Council contributing to the future maintenance of the same ; but up to the present the Council have not intimated their decision. 34 Name of Road or Street. Length in yards Name of Road or Street. Length yards.

On the 28th June notices were received from Messrs. Bircham & Co., on behalf of the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, and from Messrs. Wyatt & Co., on behalf of the House to House Electric Light Supply Company, Limited, of intention to apply, under the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 and 1888, for Provisional Orders for power to supply electricity for lighting and other purposes in certain streets within the Parish, but these applications were not proceeded with. The London Electric Supply Corporation, however, made an application under the above mentioned Acts, but the Vestry opposed the granting of the Provisional Order, inasmuch as it appeared that the Corporation did not propose to include the whole of the Parish within their area of supply, but sought the necessary powers merely with a view to the erection of a generating station for the supply of electrical energy to other portions of the Metropolis ; that the necessary notice, that the Provisional Order had been, or was intended to be applied for, 35 was not given to the Vestry by the applicants on or before the 1st July, 1889, in accordance with the provisions of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, section 4, sub-section I; and, further, that the necessary notice and advertisements relative to the proposed application did not shew that the Parish of St. Mary, Battersea, was intended to be included within such application. Owing to the opposition of the Vestry, the scheme was subsequently abandoned. Chalet Accommo-dation. On the 21st May a letter was received from the Council stating that they were of opinion that it was most desirable that the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis should provide sufficient accommodation for men and women in their districts by the provision of Chalets, or by constructing places giving such accommodation below the level of the ground, in the manner which had proved so successful in the City and elsewhere, and expressing a hope that the Vestry would do something towards making such provision in this Parish. The Vestry informed the Council that they were fully impressed with the necessity for such conveniences, and that they were prepared to at once provide such accommodation by the construction of water closets and urinals below the surface of the triangular piece of vacant land at the junction of St. John's Road and Lavender Hill upon receiving the sanction of the Council thereto. The steps which had been taken by the Vestry during the previous year with a view to the provision of a Chalet on this site are fully set forth in the last annual report. The Council have not yet announced their pleasure in the matter. Advertise-ments affixed to hoardings. The Advertising Stations (Rating) Act, 1889, affixed to came into operation on the 29th September. This Act gives the Vestry power to include in licenses granted for the erection of temporary hoardings, &c., conditions prohibiting the affixing of any advertisement, or sanctioning the affixing of advertisements thereto upon payment of such sum and on such conditions as the Vestry may determine, and on the 30th December it was decided upon the recommendation of the 36 Works and General Purposes Committee, that a charge of 1/per yard super (or part of a yard) be made for hoardings so used in main thoroughfares, and 9d. per yard super for bye streets. Overhead Wires. The Vestry on the 31st October received a letter from the Superintending Engineer, Post Office Telegraphs, applying for consent to the erection of a wire on the existing overhouse line between the Fire Brigade Station, Battersea Park Road, and the ground pole in the rear of Culvert Road, and also to an additional wire from the West London Extension Railway Bridge in Lombard Road to the Post Office, No. 193, York Road, in order to complete the direct radial system to the fire alarms, with a view to ensure more effectually the prompt attendance of the Fire Brigade at fires in the Parish. The Vestry resolved not to object to the erection of overhead wires which may be required for Fire Brigade purposes, but they are strongly of opinion that all wires should be placed underground where possible. Overflow of Sewers. The Surveyor submitted a report to the Vestry at the meeting held on the 12th June, upon the flooding of 319 houses in the Parish, consequent upon the overflow of the main sewers during the heavy fall of rain on the 25th May, and the Vestry directed that a copy of this report be forwarded to the County Council. Enlargement of Buildings, &c., Bridge Road West. The Street Cleansing Dusting and Depot mittee, having determined that their meetings should take place at the Surveyor's Office, Bridge Road West, the accommodation for this purpose was found to be totally inadequate, and the Vestry, upon the recommendation of the Committee, erected a Committee Room and also an additional office over the existing buildings, to meet the growing requirements of the work in the Surveyor's department. In order to check the weight of the provender and other stores purchased by the Vestry, it was found necessary to fix a 10 ton weighbridge at the Dep6t in Bridge Road West. 37 Street Ob-structions. The Vestry are pleased to state that they have succeeded in keeping the main thoroughfares clear from obstruction to the great benefit of the general community, with much less friction with tradesmen, and costermongers and other street vendors, than in past years. The Vestry may fairly assume that the improved condition of affairs is due in no small degree to the firm but considerate manner in which they have dealt with this difficult question through the Street Cleansing Dusting and Depot Committee. Removal of Fish Waste In consequence of continual complaints to the Vestry of the nuisance occasioned by fish vans in removing the waste from fishmongers' premises within the Parish, the Street Cleansing Dusting and Depot Committee, to whom the matter was referred, enquired fully into the whole of the circumstances, and expressed their opinion that the system of removing the fish waste was very objectionable, and was a constant source of annoyance to the public. In their report presented to the Vestry on the 23rd October, the Committee submitted a recommendation to the effect that arrangements should be made for the collection by the Vestry of the waste daily. An agreement was subsequently entered into with Mr. J. F. Johnstone, of Chrisp Street, Poplar, as a tentative measure, by which the Vestry undertook to collect the offal from the fishmongers' premises in vans and tanks to be provided by Mr. Johnstone (who agreed to convey the same away from the parish) daily. This agreement, which has been in operation for two months, terminates on the 20th July, 1890, and meanwhile the question as to the advisability of continuing the arrangement will be considered by the Vestry. Registra-tion of Horses. On the 12th June the Vestry received a letter from Major-General Ravenhill, on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, thanking the Vestry for their patriotic response to the scheme of voluntary Registration of Horses, and renewed his invitation for the Vestry to register such a number of horses for military purposes as they would be prepared to sell to the Government upon the occasion of a great national emergency. 38 The Vestry having replied that they were prepared to continue to register the ten horses selected by the Government last year, and also such further horses as the Government might require, an agreement was entered into to register the ten horses upon the same terms as before, viz., the payment by the Government of a retaining fee of 1os. per horse per annum. Dust Depot Clerical Work, Weigh-bridge, &c. Mr. F. A. Bailey, Junior Clerk in the Surveyor's Department, was transferred to the office of the Manager of the Dust Depot, Culvert Road, on the 21st October, to assist the Manager in the clerical work and record the weights registered by the weighbridge constructed at the Depot in October, for the purpose of weighing the dust and house refuse and other materials taken into and out of the Depot ; and on the 13th November the Vestry, having regard to Mr. Bailey's altered duties decided to increase his salary from £26 to £30 per annum, with an annual increment of £5 to a maximum of £50, the first increment to date from the 1st January, 1890. Inspection of Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses. In the month of October the Medical Officers of Health reported that the whole of the Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses in the parish had been inspected, and that there was no objection to be offered to the application for the renewal of the Licenses. The Licensing of Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses is one of the duties now transferred to the County Council, and the Clerk was accordingly directed to inform that body that the Vestry had no objection to offer to the renewal of any of the licenses. The number of licensed Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses in the parish is as follows:— Cow-houses 15 Slaughter-houses 17 32 39 Bake-hosues The whole of the bake-houses numbering 114 have been inspected, and after notices served to limewhite and repair in nine cases, which have been complied with, with the exception of that of No. 187, York Road, which is closed, the same are now in a satisfactory condition. Public Mortuary. Mr. A. Braxton Hicks, Coroner, having suggested that an addition should be made to the Mortuary, situate in the grounds of St. Mary's Church, Church Road, for the ambulance and shells, the Vestry resolved on the 12th June, that a closed shed should be erected at the east side of the Mortuary for this purpose. Plans were accordingly prepared by the Surveyor, and the necessary consents having been obtained, advertisements were inserted in the local newspapers inviting tenders for the execution of the work upon a Specification to be prepared by the Surveyor. The tender of Messrs. Street & Son was subsequently accepted, and the work was at once put in hand. During the past year 161 bodies have been conveyed to the Mortuary, five of which were removed for sanitary reasons only; 156 inquests were held, and 134 post mortem examinations were made. Infectious Disease (Notifi-cation) Act. On the 22nd May, the Vestry considered the great danger arising from the facility for the spread of Infectious Disease by the circulation of books from Public Libraries, and, upon the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, they directed that a communication be addressed to the Local Government Board, drawing attention to the subject, and requesting that prompt action may be taken with a view to early legislation, providing stringent penalties against persons, residing in houses where infectious disease exists, applying for, using, or returning such books without notifying the existence of disease to the Librarian, in the same way as persons suffering from infectious disease are liable to penalties for exposing themselves, without proper precaution against spreading the disease, in any street, public conveyance, &c., under the provisions of the 29 and 30 Vic., cap. 90, sec. 38. 40 On the 10th July, a reply was received from the Local Government Board, stating that a Bill had been introduced into Parliament providing that the Vestries and District Boards in London should be promptly informed of cases of Infectious Disease existing in their districts. This Bill passed into law as the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, 52 and 53 Vic., cap. 72, and came into operation on the 30th October, 1889. Under the provisions of this Act, it is compulsory for the following diseases to be notified to the Medical Officers of the Vestry, viz.:—small pox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas, scarlatina, and scarlet, typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing, continued, or puerperal fevers. The notification is required to be given by the head of the family to which the patient belongs, and, in his default, by the nearest relatives of the patient present in the building or being in attendance on the patient, and, in default of such relatives, by every person in charge of, or in attendance upon the patient, and, in default of any such person, by the occupier of the building. Every Medical Practitioner attending on, or called in to visit, the patient, is also required to give notice, and every person required by the Act to give a notice who fails to do so is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. The Act applies to every ship, vessel, boat, tent, van, shed, or similar structure used for human habitation, in like manner as nearly as may be as if it were a building. The Vestry are required to pay to Medical Practitioners for each certificate received, a fee of two shillings and sixpence if the case occurs in their private practice and a fee of one shilling if the case occurs in their practice as Medical Officer of any public body or institution. The fees paid to Medical Practitioners in respect of cases so notified are refunded to the Vestry by the Metropolitan Asylums 41 Board under the Act; but the Vestry as the Local Authority have to defray the cost of the prescribed forms, which are required to be supplied gratuitously, and other expenses incidental to the administration of the Act. The following forms were prepared by the Clerk and approved by the Sanitary Committee:- (a) Form of certificate of notification to be gratuitously supplied to any Medical Practitioner residing or practising within the Parish, as required by the Act, in books containing 100 forms with counterfoil. (b) Copy Certificate to be forwarded to the Metropolitan Asylums Board by the Vestry, as required by the Act, in books with counterfoil. (c) Notification to the Librarian and the Head Masters and Mistresses of Schools as to the existence of cases of infectious disease, in books with counterfoil. (d) Register of notifications to be kept by the Inspector of Nuisances under the direction of the Medical Officers of Health. (e) Memorandum for the information of Medical Practitioners to accompany the forms of certificate above mentioned. (f) Handbills giving notice to the inhabitants of the ments of the Act. In consequence of the additional duties devolving upon the Sanitary staff in carrying out the provisions of this Act, the Vestry on the 13th November appointed D. E. Richards to perform the clerical work in this department at a salary of eight shillings per week. Water Supply. The Vestry at their meeting on the 10th April had under consideration a report by the Sanitary Committee with reference to a case of diphtheria at a milkshop within the parish. The premises were thoroughly inspected by Mr. Oakman, Medical Officer of Health, and the Inspector of Nuisances, with 42 the view of ascertaining any sanitary defect that might exist, and if possible to prevent the spread of the disease. The premises were found to be, as regards their sanitary arrangements and their general cleanliness, in a very satisfactory condition, and the Sanitary Committee therefore, acting upon the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health, directed that a sample of the water should be taken from the drinking supply of the house, and forwarded to the Public Analyst for analysis. The result of this analysis shewed that the water contained a quantity of vegetable debris and was swarming with living Infusoriae and Bacteriae in large numbers. The condition of the water was doubtless due to improper storage and neglect to cleanse the cistern, and as water in this condition would be exceedingly dangerous to health, and might cause disease, the necessary steps were taken to enforce the immediate cleansing of the cistern. The Vestry directed that a handbill be distributed, recommending the Parishioners to periodically empty and cleanse all cisterns containing the water supply for domestic use, and to boil the water before the same is used for drinking purposes. The Vestry also addressed communications to the London County Council and the Southwark and Vauxhall and Lambeth Water Companies, requesting that the necessary steps might be taken with a view to supplying the whole of the houses and premises in the parish with a continuous supply of water, and after correspondence with the Companies, the Council replied in June to the effect that the Lambeth Water Company were willing to give a constant supply to the portion of the parish within that Company's District to which a constant supply had not already been given without the Council requiring the Company to provide a constant supply under Section 8 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, and that that Company would within a few weeks prepare plans and give notices with regard to one or more districts within the parish; and that the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co. had expressed their 43 willingness to give a constant supply to the portion of the parish within their district at the end of the year 1889. At the close of the period under review the necessary alterations to the service pipes in the portion of the parish within the district of the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, in connection with the constant supply, were being rapidly proceeded with. Seizure of Unsound Food. On the 22nd May the Vestry considered a report of the Sanitary Committee to the effect that on Saturday night, the 4th May, about ten o'clock, Inspector Richards was present in the York Road and saw Richard Garlic, of No. 108, Sheepcote Lane, with a pony and cart, selling fowls. Having ascertained that the fowls were putrid, the Inspector endeavoured to seize them, but Garlic jumped into the cart and drove away. The Inspector, however, succeeded in getting into the cart also, when Garlic drove furiously along York Road and Battersea Park Road, towards Culvert Road and back down Simpson Street, Henry Street, and Castle Street, using threats to the Inspector meanwhile. Upon reaching the corner of Althorpe Grove, Garlic stopped the pony, and the Inspector again endeavoured to seize the fowls. Garlic resisted, and a large crowd collected, and sympathised with him. A policeman then appeared, and the Inspector called him, and explained the position of affairs, and requested him to prevent a breach of the peace. The Inspector then removed about thirty of the fowls from the cart and placed them on the footpath, when Garlic in the presence of the Constable thrust the Inspector violently aside and threw the fowls into the cart. The Inspector then requested the Constable to arrest Garlic, but he refused to do so, and went away. Garlic again jumped into the cart and drove off amid the cheers of the crowd in the direction of Battersea Square, and when opposite the " Raven " publichouse, Garlic attacked the Inspector and endeavoured to throw him from the cart. After considerable difficulty the Inspector, with the assistance of some of the residents in the locality, succeeded in getting the pony and cart to the Vestry's Depot, 44 Bridge Road West, and seized forty-two fowls, which were submitted to Mr. Oakman, the Medical Officer of Health, on the following morning, who declared them to be putrid and totally unfit for human food, and on Monday, the 6th May, they were taken to the Magistrate at the Wandsworth Police Court, who ordered them to be destroyed. Proceedings were taken against Richard Garlic for offering the fowls for sale, and also for obstructing the Inspector while endeavouring to seize the same. The summonses were heard together, and the Solicitor examined the Sanitary Inspector, the Medical Officer of Health, and Mr. Ireland, one of the witnesses to the obstruction, the Inspector proving the seizure and unfitness of the fowls for food, and the Medical Officer testifying as to their putrid condition. For the defence a woman was called who stated that she had purchased ten fowls for 5/-, and a man who stated that he had purchased six for 3/. Both persons swore that the fowls were fit to be eaten, that they had eaten them, and that they were perfectly good. Upon this evidence the Magistrate stated that he was satisfied that the fowls were fit to be eaten, and he dismissed the summons for exposing the fowls for sale, but fined the defendant £1 and 2/- costs in respect of the obstruction. The Vestry considering the decision in this case most unsatisfactory directed that the facts be laid before the Home Secretary. The Vestry also considered the extreme danger to which the Inspector was exposed by the cowardly conduct of the Police Constable who refused to assist him when called upon to do so and a communication was addressed to the local police authorities with the view of ascertaining the name and number of the constable in question; the Vestry also directed that a report upon the subject be forwarded to the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis with a request that he would cause an investigation to be made into the whole of the circumstances. 45 The Inspector was commended for the courageous manner in which he effected the seizure. Urinal Accommo-dation at Licensed Premises. The Sanitary Committee on the 4th February caused communications to be addressed to the proprietors of certain public houses in the parish requiring them to provide proper urinal accommodation upon their respective premises for the use of their customers. A further communication was addressed to the defaulters on the 19th February, informing them that unless the necessary accommodation was provided by the 28th February the Vestry would consider as to making a representation to the Licensing Justices upon the application for a renewal of the licenses. The Vestry, at a meeting held on the 26th February, considered a full report of the Sanitary Committee upon the subject, and it was resolved that the Inspector of Nuisances should attend before the Justices and point out the requirements of the Vestry in the matter. Accordingly at the adjourned Sessions, held on the 31st March, the Inspector attended on behalf of the Vestry with regard to the following cases:—The Old House, Plough Road, the Rose and Crown, Culvert Road, the Victoria Tavern, Bridge Road, the Royal Oak, Patmore Street, and the Princes' Head, York Road. Considerable opposition was manifested by counsel on behalf of the publicans to the course adopted by the Vestry, but the Bench expressed their entire concurrence with the action the Vestry had taken, and considered that the alterations or additions required by the Vestry at the several premises were reasonable and absolutely necessary, and stated that had the Vestry thought it desirable to oppose the renewal of the licenses and given statutory notice to that effect, they would have refused to renew the licenses until the requirements of the Vestry had been satisfactorily complied with. The Bench under the circumstances advised the proprietors to carry out the wishes of the Vestry forthwith, and intimated 46 that in the event of the required works not being executed, and upon the Vestry giving the necessary notice at the next Licensing Sessions, they should certainly refuse the applications for the renewal of licenses in those cases to which objection was taken by the Vestry. The Vestry regard the decision of the Justices in thus fully recognizing the locus standi of the Vestry as highly important, and intend to take all necessary steps to enforce proper sanitary accommodation at public houses within the Parish. Dilapi-dated Structures. The Vestry on the 30th December considered a report of the Sanitary Committee upon a letter from the London County Council with regard to dilapidated structures and directed that the attention of the Council be drawn to the condition of the houses Nos. 22, 47, 49 and 51, and Burnell Cottage, Linford Street, which were in the opinion of the Vestry cases requiring to be dealt with by the Council under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management and Building Acts (Amendment) Act, 1882, and the Council subsequently took proceedings for the demolition of Burnell Cottage, Linford Street. Accumula-tion of refuse on land in Victoria Road. Vestry on the 12th March instructed the Medical Officer of Health and the Solicitor to prepare and present a joint report as to the course to be adopted to ensure the discontinuance of the nuisance arising from the sorting, sifting, and accumulation of refuse in Victoria Road. This report was subsequently considered by the Vestry, and the necessary proceedings for the abatement of the nuisance were ordered to be taken. Sewer Ven-tilation. During the year numerous complaints were ceived from residents along the line of the main sewer in York Road and Battersea Park Road, of the smell proceeding from the sewer gratings. Communications were accordingly addressed to the County Council upon the subject, and the Council are erecting ventilating shafts up the fronts of the houses where practicable, and closing the sewer gratings. 47 A letter from Sir Hugh Owen, Secretary, Local Government Board, was submitted to the Vestry on the 12th February, enclosing copy of the draft of a bill prepared for the purpose of consolidating the law with reference to the Public Health of the Metropolis, and inviting the suggestions of the Vestry thereon. This letter and the draft bill were referred for consideration to the Sanitary Committee, and the Committee having conferred with the Solicitor, recommended that the Clerk be directed to thank Sir Hugh Owen for his letter, and to state that the Vestry entirely agree with the proposed consolidation of the law, and that they had no suggestions to offer with regard to an amendment of the Bill. The report of the Committee was considered and approved by the Vestry on the 26th February, and a communication was addressed to Sir Hugh Owen accordingly. Adultera-tion of Food and Drugs. The Vestry have not relaxed their efforts for the detection and punishment of persons offering for sale articles of food which have been adulterated. One hundred and six samples have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts for analysis, and of these 41 samples have been certified to be more or less adulterated. The proportion of samples so adulterated will be seen to have been equal to 38.67 per cent. Legal proceedings were directed and taken in 28 cases, and in 11 cases cautionary letters were addressed to the vendors. The cases in which convictions were obtained are set out in the following table, which also shews the percentage of adulterations:— 48 Name and Address of Vendor. Description of Article.

On the 11th December it was reported to the Vestry that in the case of Mrs. L. Miller, of No. 5, Hartington Terrace, Queen's Road, Battersea, who was summoned for selling milk a sample of which upon analysis was certified by the Public Analyst to have had at least 50 per cent. of its original fat abstracted, a fine of only 3/- and 2/- costs was imposed. With regard to this case the Solicitor reported to the effect that the Defendant had a portion of the sample of milk analysed by an independent Analyst who certified that 40 per cent. at least of fat had been abstracted, the only defence being that the defendant sold such a small quantity of milk that she could not get a guarantee from the person from whom it was bought, and that although he applied for the usual costs of the analysis the Magistrate declined to grant them. The subject was referred to the consideration of the Sanitary Committee, and, upon their report, the Vestry, on the 30th December, directed a communication to be addressed to the Members of Parliament for the Borough, requesting them to bring the matter under the notice of the House of Commons. Accordingly, on the 20th February, Mr. O. V. Morgan moved, in his place in the House of Commons, for a return of the number of cases under the Food and Drugs and the Margarine Acts which had been brought before the Magistrates sitting at the Wandsworth Police Court during the past year, shewing the extent of the adulteration and the amount of fines and costs inflicted in the various cases, and the Home Secretary replied that there were twenty-three cases under the Food and Drugs Act, and thirteen under the Margarine Act, and stated that he would be happy to shew Mr. Morgan a return of the fines inflicted in each case. 50 Mr. Morgan, not being satisfied with this information, placed a further question upon the paper on the 27th February, in the following terms:— "To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, relative to the return of cases under the Sale of Food and Drugs and the Margarine Acts, which have been brought before the Magistrates sitting at the Wandsworth Police Court during the past year, and to the very inadequate fines inflicted in the various cases, whether the Local Government Board have in several of their annual reports drawn attention to the varying and insufficient penalties imposed upon offenders under these Acts, and whether, having regard to the importance to the Public of the efficient administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts, he will take such steps as he may deem advisable with a view to uniformity of practice of the Police Magistrates in the Metropolis, in dealing with offenders against the Acts in question." To this question the Home Secretary gave the following reply:— "Yes, sir, my attention has been called to those passages in the annual reports of the Local Government Board which comment upon the smallness of the fines frequently imposed in cases under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. I propose to draw the attention of the Chief Magistrate to this subject and to the complaints of the Hon. Member, and to request him, in conference with his brother Magistrates, to arrive, if possible, at some common understanding with a view to securing uniformity of practice in the administration of these Acts." The Vestry at their meeting on the 12th March, passed a vote of thanks to Mr. Morgan for the prompt and vigorous action taken by him in this matter, and congratulated him upon the very satisfactory reply of the Home Secretary. The Vestry 51 trust that the action which the Home Secretary proposes to take will have the effect of inducing the Magistrates to inflict adequate penalties, which under the Statutes they are fully empowered to do, and thus prevent to a far greater extent the gross frauds which have hitherto been practised upon the public by unscrupulous tradesmen. An important point has been raised under the Margarine Act upon a summons taken out by the Vestry against a person for exposing for sale margarine which was not labelled in accordance with the provisions of the Margarine Act. The summons was heard before Mr. F. Mead, the Magistrate sittingatthe Wandsworth Police Court, on the 26th February, who decided that inasmuch as the article was not exposed to view it was not exposed for sale. The Solicitor in pursuance of the instructions of the Sanitary Committee, applied for a case to be stated for the opinion of a Superior Court, and the Magistrate having granted the application the case is shortly expected to come before the Court for argument. The Food and Drugs Act provides that the penalties inflicted under that Act shall be paid to the Vestry to be applied in aid of expenses incurred in the execution of the Act, and the amount received by the Vestry from this source during the past year was £9 12s. 6d. The Margarine Act, however, provides that the penalties recovered under that Act may, if the Court so direct, be paid to the person who proceeds for the same to reimburse him for the legal costs of obtaining the analysis and any other reasonable expenses to which the Court shall consider him entitled, and the Court have not thought fit to award the Vestry in any case under this Act more than the costs of the summons. Appoint-ment of Assistant Inspector of Nuisances. In Tune, Mr. J. E. Evans, one of the Assistant Inspectors of Nuisances, resigned his appointment, and in response to advertisements twenty-six applications for the office were received. The Sanitary Committee having selected three Candidates, the Vestry on the 10th July appointed Mr. Isaac Young to the post at a salary of £91 per annum, the amount paid to Mr. Evans. 52 Contract for Printing In consequence of the unsatisfactory manner in which the contract for the printing work of the Vestry had been carried out for some time past, the Vestry at their meeting on the 10th April, upon the recommendation of a Special Committee appointed to consider the matter, decided to determine the contract, and notice having been given to the contractor to that effect, the contract terminated on the 31st January. In response to advertisements the tender of Mr. J. Hitchcock, of Sunny Hill Road, Streatham, was accepted for the work in question for the period ending 25th March, 1891. Office Staff-Surveryor's Depar-ment. The Vestry considered as to the additional duties imposed upon the Surveyor and the staff in his office, in connection with the taking over and performance of various important works which had hitherto been entrusted to contractors, and the office work in the Surveyor's department was re-arranged and the staff re-organized; the following additional appointments were made on the 24th July and 11th September respectively, viz.:—Mr. H. W.Phillips as Second Assistant and Draughtsman, at a salary of £100 per annum, rising by annual increments of £5, to a maximum of £120, and Mr. E. C. Jones as Chief Clerk and Accountant, at a salary of £110 per annum, rising by annual increments of £10 to a maximum of £150. On the 11th December G. King was appointed as office youth in the Surveyor's Department, at a salary of £13, per annum, in the place of Mr. F. A. Bailey, promoted to the office at the Depot, Culvert Road. Office Staff-Clerk's Depart-ments. The Vestry also took into consideration the large increase of work which had devolved upon the Clerk's Department, consequent upon the carrying out by the Vestry of the various works which had previously been performed by contractors, and which had necessitated an increase of staff in the Surveyor's Department, and also the transfer of the payment of the weekly wages from the Surveyor's to the Clerk's Department, and Mr. E. J. Wood was appointed Junior Clerk, on the nth September, and W. Stone, who had been 53 engaged as lad messenger during the past fourteen months, was, on the 24th July, promoted to this department as office youth, at salaries of £50 and £30 per annum, respectively, rising by annual increments of £10 and £5 to maximums of £80 and £50. G. W. Tubby was appointed lad messenger at a weekly wage of 8s. Applications for the whole of the above appointments were invited by advertisements in the public press. Accident, Latchmere Road Railway Bridge, Action for damages. Reference was made in the last Report of the Vestry to an action commenced against the Wandsworth Board of Works prior to the separation of the Parish of Battersea from the District of that Board, by Mr. W. Warner for damages in respect of alleged injury caused by the insufficient height of the West London Extension Railway Bridge in Latchmere Road. The action was tried on the 4th April before Mr. Justice Field and a special jury, when the plaintiff was non-suited, the Judge remarking that the plaintiff must prove negligence before he could succeed in making the Board liable and that in his opinion there was no evidence of negligence. Judgment was accordingly given for the defendants with costs. The plaintiff, however, applied to set aside the non-suit and for an order for a new trial and this application came before the Court on the 20th June when it was dismissed with costs. Brackley the Vestry. Action for seizure of barrow. An action was commenced against the Vestry on the 30th August, 1888, by Mr. H. Brackley for the alleged illegal seizure of a barrow-and goods by the Vestry's Street Keeper on the 14th July of that year in Falcon Road. The case came before Mr. Justice Charles on the 2nd May, 1889, when judgment was given in favour of the Vestry with costs, but with a stay of execution for 14 days to allow the plaintiff to appeal should he be so advised. The plaintiff gave notice of appeal and on the 8th August it was heard before Lord Esher, the Master of the Rolls, and Lords Justices Lindley and Bowen and dismissed with costs, the Court unanimously upholding the judgment of the Court below, and 54 the Vestry instructed the Solicitor to take the necessary proceedings for the recovery of the costs awarded by the Courts. Action against the Street Keeper. In September, a writ of action was issued on behalf of Mr. John Tyler, of No 44, Falcon Grove, against Mr. J. Willson, the Vestry's Street Keeper, for the recovery of the sum of £50 for alleged acceptance by him of a fee under colour of his office. The Vestry instructed their Solicitor to defend the action; in February, the plaintiff having omitted to make the statement of claim, the Vestry directed that the necessary steps should be taken with a view to the discharge of the action. Legal proceed-ings. The Vestry found it necessary to instruct the Solicitor in no less than 135 cases which were brought before the Magistrate sitting at the Police Court at Wandsworth during the past year, and penalties amounting to £14 2s. 6d. were recovered and paid in to the account of the Vestry. The several matters with which the Magistrate was required to deal were as follows:— For enforcing payment of amounts due under orders of apportionment of the cost of paving new streets 44 For the abatement of nuisances of various kinds 33 Street obstructions 10 Proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 27 Building without notice 1 Depositing refuse on highways 14 Embezzlement 1 Damaging street lamps 3 Seizure of unsound food 1 Obstructing Officer in the execution of his duty 1 135 Parlia-mentary plans. In the month of November, Parliamentary Plans affecting this Parish were deposited at the Vestry's Offices by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company in accordance with the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. 55 The Bill to which these plans related, viz.:—the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (Various Powers) Bill, dealt with the widening and improvement of the railway at Victoria, Battersea, &c., and contained clauses which would, if the bill passed into law, authorize the Company to deal with the following matters:— The stopping up of the footpath on the southern side of the West London Extension Railway leading from Falcon Road to Clapham Junction, &c. The closing of Prested Road, St. John's Hill. The widening of the line under St. John's Hill, the new bridge recently constructed by the Vestry adjoining the Royal Masonic Institution for Girls, Wandsworth Common, and the bridge, Bellevue Road. The acquisition of the whole of the land, houses, and roadway situated between the existing lines of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, Culvert Road, and the West London Extension Railway, and the closing of cartway entrance from Culvert Road to the Vestry's Dust Depot. The Bill having been duly considered, the Vestry decided to petition against the same praying to be heard by Counsel with a view to the insertion of clauses for the protection of the Vestry and for the improvement of so much of the archway in Culvert Road as belongs to the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company, to which reference has already been made on page 29 of this report. Revision of Bye-Laws. The Bye-Laws and Standing Orders of the Vestry underwent revision during the period covered by this report, and many material alterations and amendments were made. Wages of Workmen in the employ of the Vestry. The Vestry at their Meetings on the 12th and 19th February, considered the question of the wages of the workmen in their employ, and after fully debating the matter, adopted a scale regulating the future payment of wages. 56 Coroner's Court. The Vestry at their Meeting on the 22nd October, considered the question of providing a Coroner's Court, and referred the subject for further consideration to the Works and General Purposes Committee. This Committee invited Mr. Braxton Hicks, the Coroner, to attend their Meeting, and devoted considerable time to the reference. Mr. Braxton Hicks conferred with the Committee, and suggested certain premises which were, in his opinion, suitable for the purpose, and which he believed were for sale, and the freehold could be obtained upon reasonable terms. The Committee having caused enquiries to be made, found that the premises in question were not for sale. A report was subsequently presented to the Vestry to this effect, and Mr. Braxton Hicks was informed accordingly. Board Schools, Battersea Park Road exits. The Vestry on the 11th January drew the attention of the School Board for London to the danger to the scholars attending their Battersea Park Road Schools owing to all the gates of the schools being in Battersea Park Road and suggested that additional means of exit should be provided from the schools in question into Forfar Road where there was very little vehicular traffic. The Vestry, however, regret to state that after considerable correspondence the Board declined to adopt the suggestion. Access to Battersea Railway Station. The Vestry at their meeting on the 18th December considered as to the inconvenience occasioned by the want of a railway station on the West London Extension Railway in Battersea Park Road near Christ Church, and a communication was addressed to the Railway Company, suggesting that the station in the High Street should be removed to the Battersea Park Road. A reply was received from the Company on the 28th February stating that the Directors regretted that they could not entertain the suggestion of the Vestry. A further proposition was then submitted to the Company that in order to meet the demands of the neighbourhood direct means of communication should be established between the Battersea Park Road and the platforms of the Company's existing station, but to this the Directors also declined to accede. 57 Approach-es to the Clapham Junction Railway Station. The Vestry presented memorials to the London, Brighton and South Coast, and the London and South Western Railway Companies, and also to the Board of Trade, drawing attention to the dangerous condition of the approaches to the several platforms at Clapham Junction Railway Station, and suggesting that the name of the Station should be changed to Battersea Junction. The Companies stated in reply to these memorials that they were constructing the necessary steps with a view to affording increased facilities of approach to the platforms but that for various reasons they could not adopt the suggestion of the Vestry to alter the name of the Station. Opposition to applica-tion for beer off-license for No. 133, Sugden Road. The application for a beer off license for the premises No. 133, Sugden Road, at the corner of Clapham Common, North Side, referred to in the previous report of the Vestry, wasrenewed. The Vestry, by their Solicitor, again opposed the application, as did also the residents in the locality, and the Justices having viewed the premises, and having regard to the strong opposition, decided to refuse the application. School Board Precepts. The large increase which has taken place in the amounts of the precepts of the School Board for London has also occupied the attention of the Vestry, and having regard to the excessive taxation borne by the ratepayers of the Parish and the Metropolis generally, they resolved to communicate with the Vestries and District Boards throughout the Metropolis with a view to a Conference being held in order that united action might be taken to urge Her Majesty's Government to take such steps as might be necessary to secure a greater economy in the administration of the affairs of the School Board. In response to their invitation the Vestry received replies from a large number of the Vestries and District Boards expressing a desire to be represented at the proposed Conference. On the 10th March, however, the Vestry received a letter from the Vestry Clerk of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington, stating that the subject had been considered by that Vestry and forwarding 58 copy of the resolution passed by the Vestry of Kensington thereon, and asking the Vestry to co-operate with them by appointing Delegates to attend a Conference to be held at the Kensington Town Hall. The Vestry, although the first to move in the matter, were very anxious that the whole of the local Authorities in the Metropolis should work harmoniously together, and as they felt that two independent Conferences would not tend to strengthen any representations which might be made to H.M. Government upon the question, they resolved to cordially unite with the Vestry of Kensington, and the position of the Kensington Town Hall especially commended itself as a convenient place of meeting for Delegates from the whole Metropolis. The Vestry therefore decided to forego the holding of a Conference, and appointed Messrs. F. Higgs, H. Tumor, and A. Bridge, Delegates to represent the Vestry at the Conference to be held at Kensington. The Vestry also addressed a further communication to the other Vestries and District Boards expressing a hope that they would adopt a similar course. Business Papers of the Country Council. The Vestry in September addressed a tion to the County Council, asking in common with the other Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, that the Council would continue the practice established by the late Metropolitan Board of Works, and furnish the local authorities with the reports of the Committees of the Council before the meeting of the Council at which the same would be presented. The Council however, considered it inexpedient that reports of Committees should be communicated to outside parties before submission to the Council, but stated that although the relation of the Council to the Vestries and District Boards differed very much from that of the late Metropolitan Board of Works, the Council were at all times desirous of affording to the local bodies all possible information respecting its proceedings, and of co-operating with them in promoting the interests of the inhabitants of London. The Vestry regret this decision, as it is very desirable that the 59 Councillors for the Local Divisions should be made acquainted with the views of the Vestry upon questions affecting this Parish before the Council come to a determination thereon. Opening of the Galleries of the RoyalAcademy of Arts on Saturday evening. With reference to the petition mentioned in the last report as having been presented by the Vestry to the Governing Body of the Royal Academy of evenings. Arts, urging the extreme desirability of the ing of the art galleries on Saturday evenings, at a reduced fee, in order that the exhibition might be accessible to the working classes, a further communication was received from the Secretary to the Academy, stating that the President and Council regretted that, after giving the matter their very careful consideration, they found that there were certain difficulties of a practical character which render it, in their opinion, impossible to comply with the Vestry's request. Motions after notice The business introduced by private Members will be gathered from the following motions, which were submitted for the consideration of the Vestry after due notice, in accordance with the Bye-Laws; the name of the Member by whom the motion was introduced, and the result in each case, is also set out:— 10 April, 1889.

The Council for the Administrative County of London succeeded to the powers, duties and responsibilities of the late Metropolitan Board of Works on the 21 st March, 1889, and the Vestry at a meeting held on the 27th March unanimously passed the following resolution in recognition of the efficient manner in which Mr. Purdy, their representative upon the late Board, continued to discharge his duties until the Board ceased to exist. This resolution was, by direction of the Vestry, suitably inscribed and presented to Mr. Purdy at a meeting held on the 27th March, 1889:— That this Vestry do, and they do hereby tender their sincere and hearty thanks to Nathaniel Purdy, Esq., for the faithful and efficient manner in which he has discharged the responsible and onerous duties devolving upon him as the Representative of this Vestry at the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Vestry fully recognize the tact, energy and ability which have characterized Mr. Purdy's action in connection with the varied and important questions affecting the welfare of this Parish which have been dealt with 72 by the Metropolitan Board of Works during his term of office, especially the intended widening of the thoroughfares of Nine Elms Lane, Battersea Park Road and York Road, and they sincerely hope that Mr. Purdy may long be spared to continue to exercise his sound judgment and knowledge of local questions for the benefit of the ratepayers of the Parish of St. Mary, Battersea. Vote of thanks to Mr. E. Wood, J. P. On the 8th May, 1889, the date of the last Meeting of the Vestry prior to the annual elections in that month, Mr. E. Wood, J.P., made a personal statement from the Chair with regard to his retirement from the Vestry, when the following resolution was unanimously passed and by order of the Vestry suitably inscribed and presented to Mr. Wood That this Vestry learn with extreme regret that Mr. Churchwarden Edward Wood, Justice of the Peace for the County of Surrey, and for the Administrative County of London, does not intend to allow himself to be nominated for re-election as a Member of the Vestry, and the Vestry cannot permit the retirement of Mr. Wood from the busy arena of parochial affairs, in which he has borne so prominent a part during the past twelve years, to take place, without recording their appreciation of the valuable services rendered to the Parish during that period. The position which Mr. Wood has taken upon the many important questions and reforms with which the Vestry have dealt during his Membership; his constant and careful attention and complete knowledge of parochial matters; and his thorough grasp of the various subjects which have from time to time presented themselves for consideration, have contributed in no small degree to the satisfactory conclusions at which the Vestry have arrived. The Burial Board, Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, the Board of Governors of the Sir 73 Walter St. John's Trust, the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District, the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Board of Churchwardens and Overseers, have at different periods claimed Mr. Wood as a colleague; for six years he occupied the distinguished position of Churchwarden, having served three years as the elected representative of the Vestry, and three years as Vicar's Warden. The Vestry are further desirous of tendering their hearty thanks and congratulations to Mr. Wood upon the admirable manner in which, during the period of his Wardenship, he has acted as Chairman of the Vestry, a position to which in the absence of the Reverend Canon J. Erskine Clarke, M.A., the Vicar, he has invariably been elected, and the impartiality, tact, and experience in the conduct of public meetings, which he has thus displayed, have greatly assisted in the transaction of the important business which has devolved upon the Vestry since the transfer of the Parish from Schedule "B" to Schedule "A" of the Metropolis Local Management Act, by virtue of the provisions of the Battersea and Westminster Act, 1887 (50 and 51 Vic., cap. 17). This important change in the Local Government of the Parish of St. Mary, Battersea, with a population of upwards of 170,000 persons, whereby the ratepayers obtained for the first time a direct control by elected representatives of their local affairs, being due in a great measure to the instrumentality of Mr. Wood. County Councillors The Vestry in their last Annual Report, dealing with the Local Government (England and Wales) Act, 1888, referred to the great disadvantage under which the Metropolis, pending the establishment of District Councils, would labour owing to the severance of all connection between the Central and the present Local Authorities. Under the provisions 74 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestries elected representatives to the Metropolitan Board of Works and were therefore in direct touch with that body, but this is not now the case. One of the representatives for the Electoral Division of Battersea upon the County Council, Mr. James Tims, was also an elected member of the Vestry during the period ended the 25th March, and the Vestry are pleased to record that Mr. J. Burns, the colleague of Mr. James Tims, for this Division, and Mr. T. L. Corbett and Colonel A. Rotton, Councillors for the Electoral Division of Clapham, have accepted their invitation, and have been frequently in attendance at their meetings. These gentlemen have on several occasions supplied the Vestry with information as to the proceedings of the Council upon matters of local interest, which could not otherwise have been obtained, and have also been informed of the wishes of the Vestry upon such subjects.

J. T. PILDITCH, Surveyor. The Uestry of the Parish of St. Mary, [SANITARY DEPARTMENT.] REPORT upon the SANITARY CONDITION of The Parish of St. Mary, Battersea, DURING THE YEAR 1889. by the MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH. 1890. Co the uestrg of the parish of st. mary, Battersea. Gentlemen, In presenting our report for 1889, on the sanitary condition of the parish during that year, we have to congratulate you, as the Sanitary Authority, on the persistent improvement in the public health, which the following statistics amply demonstrate. In our report for the year 1888, we gave a statement of the ascertained mortality per thousand in the parish for several groups of years. Thus, in the seven years inclusive from 1867 to 1873, the mortality was 22.98 From 1874 to 1880 20.32 From 1881 to 1887 18.75 During the year 1888 15.83 „ „ 1889 14.48 For the twenty-one years, 1867 to 1887 inclusive, the mean mortality was 20.68 per thousand; that for the year 1889, including the deaths of all non-parishioners in the Workhouse Infirmary, and other public institutions situated within the parish, being, as above stated, 14.48; and therefore, 6.2 per thousand below that average; and 3.0 per thousand below the Metropolitan mortality of 17.4, for 1889, according to the Annual Summary of the Registrar General. During the year 1889, there died within the parish as is shewn in appended table of Mortality A.

Totals 2240 1093 1147 713 365 49 55 223 352 411 62 30 54 231 1925 4 Upon an estimated population of 154,595, as calculated in accordance with the method formulated by the Registrar General, a mortality of 14.48 per thousand will be deduced. It is obvious that, immediately before the census year, estimated populations are frequently very wide of the correct numbers. What is believed to be the real state of the population of Battersea is, that owing to the tendency to gravitate towards the Southern and Western districts of the parish, the population for East Battersea is over estimated; that for West Battersea equally under estimated; and that in the whole parish not very far from the estimated numbers exist. The next annual report will not be presented until the census of 1891 has been taken, and the actual numbers of the people are known, when the calculations therein contained will be based upon absolutely accurate data. Our present estimates of population may, however, be provisionally accepted as the most correct obtainable. It has been stated by some, that vast numbers of the people of Battersea die, outside the parish, in the hospitals and other public institutions of the Metropolis. In the report for 1888, it was shewn that the persons so dying were almost exactly balanced by the number of non-parishioners who die in the Workhouse Infirmary and other institutions situated within the precincts of the parish. The number of Battersea parishioners dying, both within and without the parish, during 1889 are here given.

This is the highest death-rate which any mode of calculation can assign to the parish, and is 2.44 below the Metropolitan mortality of 17.4 per thousand. Particulars of the causes of death of all persons dying in public institutions in the parish are given in Table B, and when these are added to those contained in the Statistics of Mortality for East and West Battersea respectively (which latter only include the ordinary residents), the total number of deaths will be found to be 2,240, as shewn in the Table A of Mortality Statistics. Births. The total number of births registered in the whole parish, during 1889, was 5,161, exceeding the numbers of the previous year by one hundred. The birth-rate was 33.38 per thousand for the year ; that for the Metropolis, by the Annual Summary of the Registrar General, being 30.3 per thousand, the rate becoming in both instances lower year by year. Natural The excess of births over deaths, during the year, was Increase. 2,921, which is termed the natural increase. As an estimated increase of 5,896 is, in accordance with the law for estimating populations, assumed for the year, the remaining 2,975, so added, would be made up by immigration into the parish from elsewhere. At the usual estimate of seven persons to a house, four hundred and forty-four new houses would be required to house these latter. But it is probable that many of the existing houses are, without illegal over-crowding, more densely inhabited than heretofore. Infectious The total number of deaths from diseases of this class, Diseases. during the year, was three hundred and sixty-six, being, in proportion to the population, the lowest recorded zymotic mortality, and equal to 2.36 per thousand. 7 Notifica- Diseases of the variety termed zymotic, infectious or tion of Infectious epidemic, that is, diseases which are readily Diseases communicated from one individual to another through the medium of the air, water, food, or by contact with articles of clothing, &c., or the surface of the persons affected; after a contest for existence, which has always gone on between the defensive forces of the human body and the specific elements constituting these diseases, are now being brought under control, owing to the improved knowledge of the method of their propagation, distinguishing the science of medicine of the present day from the crude speculations of former eras, when they were considered as necessary scourges inflicted by providence for some purpose not defined. It is now known that they all depend upon the development and multiplication of certain specific germs of very low organization and of a type akin to the lowest forms of cell growth. Their origin is absolutely unknown, but the fact of their transferance from the body of a sick person to that of a healthy one, unprotected by a previous attack, is well recognised. It is found that they all have but a limited radius of infectivity, and that absolute separation of the sick from the healthy, with proper disinfection of their apartments, clothing, and other immediate surroundings, will absolutely arrest any extension of these diseases. In order to secure such isolation, it is necessary that those in charge of the sanitation of any given district should have accurate knowledge of every case of infectious disease, and this is provided for by the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, which came into operation on October 30th, 1889. Up to the 28th day of December last, the following cases were notified under the provisions of that Act in the Parish of Battersea 8  East West Total Scarlet Fever 43 56 99 Diphtheria 27 56 83 Erysipelas 24 41 65 Enteric Fever 7 20 27 Peurperal Fever 0 I 1 Continued Fever 1 0 1 Total Cases 102 174 276 It is also provided that in addition to the above mentioned diseases, there are included Small-Pox, Cholera, Membranous Croup, and Relapsing Fever, "together with any other infectious disease to which the Act has been applied by the local authority in manner provided by the Act." The Local Authority in this case is the Metropolitan Asylums Board, which repays all sums disbursed by the Vestry in payment of fees to medical practitioners in attendance, who notify the existence of any of the above-mentioned diseases. There is a conspicuous omission from the list of infectious diseases of Measles and Whooping Cough, which reference to the table of Statistics of Mortality (Table A), will shew combinedly caused one hundred and eighty-five deaths, out of the total zymotic mortality of three hundred and sixty-six, or rather more than one half. When it is remembered that both these extensively fatal diseases are amenable to the same laws of prevention as the other diseases of the zymotic class, it will be evident that a great responsibility rests upon those who oppose the inclusion of Measles and Whooping Cough in the list of notified diseases; and by their ill-considered antagonism, prevent the Metropolitan Asylums Board from receiving cases which are not effectively isolated. But very few years since, it was generally considered inadvisable, and indeed useless, to attempt to remove to hospital cases of Small Pox, Scarlet, Typhus, or Typhoid Fever, and assertions were frequently made that the people generally would never assent to the removal of 9 their friends and relatives to hospital when attacked by either of those diseases. We know how signally all such predictions have failed, it now being a very rare circumstance for any opposition being offered to removal to hospital of such cases where proper isolation cannot be provided at home. Indeed, it is very common for the Sanitary department to receive a request for the removal of the patient, together with the notification form. In every case where the notifying medical attendant is not satisfied with the efficiency of isolation of a case, the assistant inspector of the sub-district in which it occurs, inspects the house as soon as the notification is received; and, in the majority of cases, the patient is in hospital within two or three hours, without trouble or expense to the family or friends. The continued diminution of zymotic diseases depends upon the energetic and early isolation of the sick, and the separation of the healthy from them. Vaccina- The supplemental return, made to the Guardians tion Re- turns for 1888 annually by their Vaccination Officer, is subjoined. The total number of births returned by the Registrars was 5,081, of whom 476 died unvaccinated, a great number being children of premature birth. Forty were returned as insusceptible of vaccination; which is very doubtful, as arm to arm vaccination will be successful in 99 per cent. of cases, and the so termed insusceptible cases will generally take if care be taken to vaccinate with fresh lymph from arm to arm. The use of stored lymph, whether human or animal, is, without doubt, the cause of most of the failures. Five hundred and fifty-seven had removed, or were lost sight of, a very large proportion altogether, as the Vaccination Officers of the districts to which removals could only be communicated with in sixteen cases. The postponement, by medical certificate, of eighty-two cases, had not expired at the date of the return. The other 3,926 cases were successfully vaccinated. 10 Supplemental Return, 1889.] VACCINATION. Registration Sub-District. Number of Births returned in the Birth List Sheets—1888.

We have the honour to be, gentlemen, Your obedient servants, W. H. KEMPSTER, J. OAKMAN, Medical Officers of Health for Battersea. 12 The Registrar General in a foot note to his weekly reports remarks that "the population is estimated on the hypothesis that the rate of increase in the last inter-censal period has been maintained since 1881; nine years after the last enumeration, such an hypothesis is, however, obviously somewhat untrustworthy." In my report for the year 1888, it was stated that "the determination of the real population becomes increasingly difficult, the more remote the preceding census. As a fresh numbering of the people will take place in 1891, no estimation of the number of inhabitants residing in East Battersea during the year can be absolutely depended upon; that of the Registrar General, which assumes that the population has increased to the same extent as during the inter-censal period 1871-81, being, however, sufficiently approximate to correctness for the purpose of ascertaining the birth and death rates." The usual methods therefore will be used in estimating the population of East Battersea for the purpose of calculating these rates, and this assumes the residence in the district of 78,446 persons during 1889. There can be but little doubt that this somewhat overstates the real population, the greater increase having taken place in the Western division of the parish, 13 It is well, however, to point out that even should the population be over estimated to the extent of 10,000 persons, the real death-rate in that case would only be 1.75 per thousand higher. At all events, all sanitary districts are in a similar difficulty, and if we err, we do so in very excellent company. The arguments in favour of a quinquennial census for the large towns, obviously are that a more accurate knowledge of the real population would be always attainable; and in addition to this it may be urged that the Registrar General's department has to make a great and most expensive augmentation of its forces for some years at each censal period, only to be broken up when its records are completed; whereas an enumeration of the people taken every five years would occupy a smaller, less expensive, and more useful because more efficient staff, permanently. Table I. shews that the natural increase of the population, that is the excess of births over deaths during 1889 was 1,528; singularly enough the same number as in 1888, and tending inter alia to shew that the population is somewhat stationary. The calculated increase of population for the year is 2,948, which would leave a balance to be made up by immigration of 1,420. This table also shews the births and deaths with their respective rates for the ten preceding years. Births. The births of 2,411 children, 1,267 males and 1,144 females, were registered during 1889, being one hundred and two less in number than in the preceding year. The birth rate was equal to 30.73 per thousand, by far the lowest rate recorded for the district. This decrease, as Table I. shews, appears to be a permanently progressive one, as is indeed the case with the Metropolis at large. Whether the lowered birth rate results from the greater mean age of the population, the result of lives saved by improved sanitary conditions: or greater 14 prudence in undertaking the responsibilities of matrimony until a later period of life than formerly (and this alone would greatly diminish the number of births, it having been authoritatively stated that if the average age of women at the time of marriage was increased by five years, the population would become absolutely stationary, that is, there would be no excess of births over deaths): or whether less obvious causes control this diminution of the birth rate cannot be determined with any degree of certainty, probably they all contribute to the result.

The total mortality in East Battersea during 1889 was 883, the details of which will be found in Table III, which shews the deaths from each class of disease, the sex, mortality, age grouping at the time of death, and the social position of the deceased as deposed to by the informants at the time of registration. The eight hundred and eighty-three deaths upon the officially assumed population for the year would give the extremely low rate of 11.25 per thousand. Many causes have contributed to this result; the very small zymotic mortality being probably the most prominent, a result upon which the Local Sanitary Authority may be congratulated as the measures they have energetically and persistently carried out for the purpose of averting all pveventible diseases from the inhabitants of the district have been rewarded by conspicuous success; with the absolute certainty that those measures have been the means of preventing or arresting other diseases not usually included in the category of infectious diseases, but equally affected by general sanitation and improved conditions of existence. 16 TABLE III.

From one to five years, 165 deaths occurred, equal to 18 per cent. of such deaths. Under five years, all the above-mentioned deaths combined numbered 473, being 53 per cent. of the total deaths. This, high as it is, is a very distinct improvement upon the infantile mortality of past years; indeed, it may be said, that the greatest saving in human life recently effected has been at the infantile period, a result at which sanitarians have always aimed. Still, the waste of life at these ages is far too great. Thus, out of 140 deaths from zymotic disease during the year, 118 were in children under five years of age. The numbers dying under one year are duly augmented by the inclusion of 107 deaths from Premature Birth, Low Vitality, or Congenital Mal-formation, most of which are wholly unavoidable, and of whom a majority, previous to the strengthening of the law on the subject some few years since, would have been buried as stillborn. The number of deaths under one year per thousand births was 127, comparing favorably with the preceding year, when it was 146 per thousand births. From old age twenty persons died, nine being over 80 years. In the case of many other very aged persons, death was ascribed to other causes, one hundred and thirty-three persons dying between sixty and eighty years of age, and sixteen over eighty years.

Measles has been the most fatal of the class, forty-eight deaths having taken place. Its associated disease, Whooping Cough, was fatal in twenty-one cases, a very great reduction on the mortality of past years. Still sixty-nine deaths from these combined causes is excessive, and it must not be forgotten, that although not perhaps immediately fatal, attacks of these diseases are frequently followed by Tubercular diseases and affections of the Brain and nervous system. They seem to bring into activity morbid constitutional tendencies which might otherwise have remained quiescent. Isolation is the only effectual means of meeting this type of disease, and much has been done in this direction by the receipt of information from the masters and mistressesof thepublic schools in the parish, whom I have to thank sincerely for the courtesy which they have always shewn in sending notification of the existence of zymotic disease in the families of their pupils; a courtesy which has, as far as possible, been met by the Sanitary department giving notice of the existence of infectious disease in the families of their school children. It is believed that the reciprocal adoption of these measures has averted much sickness, and probably saved many lives. Diarrhoea caused thirty-eight deaths, being an extremely small number as compared with all previously recorded years, with the exception of 1888. This was the result of the low temperature which prevailed during the usually hotter months. The average number of deaths from diarrhceal diseases during the ten years 1879-89, being sixty-four per annum. Scarlet Fever caused but nine deaths, a great contrast to the high mortality of some previous years. Diphtheria had a mortality of eleven, slightly above the average, and caused by the inclusion of many cases formerly called Croup, but which are now known to be Diphtheritic Laryngitis, or, as it is officially termed, Membranous Croup. The Zymotic death-rate for the year under report was but 1.7 per thousand, by far the lowest during any year on record. 19 Influenza. At the end of December, especially on the 28th, very numerous persons, mostly males, of active habits and employed away from home, were simultaneously attacked by great prostration, pains in the back and limbs, especially in the muscles; with, in many cases, severe headache from brain implication, jaundice from the liver being affected, or other symptoms characteristic of the invasion of different organs. Shivering, followed by a very high temperature, and terminating by a sweating stage, characterised the attack, clearly pointing to a malarious origin, in which the cold, hot, and sweating stages are typical. Relapses were very common, the duration of each attack being three to four days; where existing longer, its remittent character being clearly manifest. Large numbers of persons were attacked on the same day, and, as subsequent experience shewed that the period of inculation was about two to three days, probably 72 hours, it seemed that some aerial influence was the scource, hence the name fancifully applied to the disease in the middle ages, since which era many such visitations have been recorded. The affection soon spread to the families of those primarily attacked, the first being the wives of men already affected, and then the younger members of the family contracted the disease ; giving distinct evidence of its infectivity, in which respect, indeed, it seems to exceed most diseases. Very few, if any, deaths arose directly from influenza, except, perhaps, in the very old or very young, and then from intercurrent diseases, such as Bronchitis, and especially Pneumonia, in the latter respect strongly resembling Measles. It was subsequently found that the invasion of influenza had the effect of stimulating into activity dormant tendencies to constitutional disease, more especially tuberculous affections and diseases of the nervous system. In fact, the evil results of the disease were felt by many people long after apparent recovery. The majority, however, speedily convalesced sufficiently to resume their respective occupations, a week or ten days usually ending the illness. Great diversity was, 20 ever, exhibited by different constitutions, some recovering in two or three days completely, others convalescing very slowly, and not throwing off the effects of the attack for months. Metropolitan The cases of zymotic disease admitted to the Asylums Board Hospitals. hospitals of this Authority during 1889 are given below, together with the mortality therefrom. Cases. Deaths. Scarlet Fever 29 4 Enteric Fever 2 1 Diphtheria 7 1 Totals 38 6 Two other deaths arose from lung diseases. It appears, therefore, that one in seven and a quarter of the cases of Scarlet Fever died; one half of the two cases of Enteric Fever, which number, being so small, hardly permits of the determination of a fair average; and that the cases of Diphtheria were fatal to the extent of fourteen per cent. In all the six deaths in the 38 cases admitted, give a fatality of 15.7 per cent., which considering the severe type of many of the cases cannot be considered as excessive, speaking well for the treatment of patients in these institutions, being in all probability a much lower percentage of mortality that would have occurred if left at home with, in too many circumstances, insanity surroundings, defective nursing, and probably, improper food. Besides the great argument in favour of removal is that where it is resorted to at an early stage of the disorder, it is very rarely indeed that an extension of such disease is found amongst the other inhabitants of the house from which the patient has been relioved. Deaths in One hundred and sixty-eight persons, ninety-three stitutions. males and seventy-five females, died in 1889, in various public institutions outside the district, who were registered as having been parishioners of East Battersea; a large number of whom were probably members of families resident in the Parish but themselves employed elsewhere. These 168 deaths are equal to a death rate on the estimated population of 2.12 per thousand, and if added to the death rate 21 of 1125 of residents in the district would give a gross death rate of 13.37 per thousand for the year 1889. This is by far the most onerous test of the mortality of a district, and speaks well for the salubrity of East Battersea. The details shew that 101 died in the various hospitals of the Metropolis, 49 in the Union Infirmary, eight in the infectious disease Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board, eight in the County Lunatic Asylum, while one man died suddenly in the Vestry Yard of Saint George in the East, and the body of another man was found in the River Thames, at Wapping.

The non-zymotic diseases which proved fatal during as usual, varied but slightly from the normal number, a proof, in an increasing 1 Population, of a high 22 health standard. It will, however, be noted upon reference to Table VI that the deaths so registered, seven hundred and fortythree, are smaller in number than during any of the ten preceding years. The real decrease is of course greater than appears from these figures, as the population has probably increased considerably during the decade. It will be observed that these diseases exhibit much the same relative proportions; with perhaps the exception of deaths registered from premature birth, many of which were formally registered as stillborn; but in compliance with more stringent legal regulations are now registered if having an independent existence, if that be but for a few hours or minutes.

Totals 760 793 744 798 818 867 878 897 770 802 743 There can be no doubt that the Sanitary measures which have lowered the mortality from Zymotic Disease have lessened the incidence of the so called Non-Zymotic Diseases, many of which are governed by the same laws as those of the infectious kind, although the connexion between the two classes may not 28 be very obvious. For example, the tubercular diseases, more especially ordinary consumption, are now considered by most competent authorities to be highly infectious, and therefore amenable to those measures which control the diseases of that class. Uncertified Sixty-eight deaths occurred during 1889 in East Deaths. Battersea, where no medical certificate was obtainable. Sixty-four of these were submitted to the Coroner, Mr. A. Braxton Hicks, who held inquests in 59 cases, and decided that in five the cause of deaths was obvious, and directed registration. Three of these latter were under one day old, and resulted from premature birth or defective vitality; one died from convulsions, aged five months, and the other was an aged person of 72 years, who died of "syncope from senile decay." There were four deaths which do not appear to have been submitted to the Coroner, in the first three it is stated that an unregistered practitioner was in attendance, and in the last case a certificated midwife. The particulars of these cases is as follows:— Male 2 years. Measles 21 days, Bronchitis 7 days, Convulsions. Female 37 years. Bronchitis 14 days, Exhaustion 12 hours. Male 7 years. Tubes Mesenterica 4 months, Exhaustion 24 hours. Female 2 hours. Probably inviability. (" Doctor did not attend until after death.") VaccinaThe numbers of successful cases of primary tion. vaccination and re-vaccination respectively in the register kept by the Public Vaccinator during the year 1889 are as follows:— Primary Vaccinations 1,146 Re-vaccinations 13 Total 1,159 24 Inquests. In the fifty-nine cases in which inquests were held by the Coroner, the recorded verdicts were as follows:— From Natural Causes 26 From Accidental Causes:— Asphyxia (fourteen in bed with parents) 20 Concussion, Compression, and Fracture 4 Drowned 2 Poisoned by Carbolic Acid 1 27 Homicidal:— Wilful Murder—Newly born, Suffocation,one; Portions of Body of Female aged 24 in Park, River, &c., all belonging to one person 2 Suicide—Drowned, one; Cut Throat, one; Hanging, one; Poisoning by Styrchnine, one 4 — 6 Total 59 In former years attention has been drawn to the large number of infants asphyxiated in bed with parents or other persons, and the sad prevalence of such cases continues. The proportion of inquests to deaths is 6-8 per cent, which, although not quite so high as in 1888, is much above the Metropolitan average, and affords evidence of the exemplary manner in which the Coroner carries out his important duties, all the enquiries conducted by him being of a very complete nature.

TABLE VIII. Summary of sanitary operations in East Battersea during the years 1888 and 1889:— 1888. 1889. Number of Houses and Premises Inspected 12,743 12,388 First Notices Served 999 1,383 Second Notices Served 154 136 Number of Houses Disinfected and Cleansed after Infectious Diseases 176 95 Overcrowding Abated 15 13 Premises Cleansed and Repaired 164 128 Defective Drains Cleansed and Repaired 338 634 Sink and Waste Pipes Altered to Discharge Outside over Gullies or Syphon Traps Fixed 572 628 Water Closets Cleansed and Repaired 47 69 Water Closets, supply of water laid on 505 636 Urinals Cleansed 4 3 Accumulations of Manure Removed 10 7 Cesspools Abolished 16 1 Dust Bins Provided 180 159 Mews and Stables Drained and Paved 12 4 Yards Drained and Paved 7 88 Leaky House-roofs and Gutters Repaired 32 90 Houses Supplied with Water 9 10 Cisterns Covered and Repaired 242 252 Houses Supplied with Disinfectants 1,100 487 Proceedings Ordered by Vestry 34 142 Summonses Issued 5 20 Magisterial Orders Obtained and Enforced 3 20 Three trunks of plaice were ordered to be destroyed as unfit for human food, being the only unsound food detected during the year; a great contrast with the large quantities of diseased and decomposed food condemned in former years. 69 The Sanitary Staff has been actively engaged during the year under report in the work of inspecting the houses, workshops, factories and other premises in the district. Reference to the Summary Table VIII will shew that the number of such premises inspected was 12,388, being slightly fewer than in 1888 but with the result that first notices were served to remedy defects in 1,383 instances. In about ten percent. of these cases, viz.: in 136 instances, second notices had to be served involving re-inspection—which in fact was necessary wherever defects were found, in order to test the result of the first notice. Proceedings were ordered by the Vestry in 142 instances, but its orders were complied with before the issue of a summons in all but twenty cases, in all of which latter magisterial orders were obtained and the necessary works carried out. The Table shews how varied were the defects remedied. It will be observed that but 95 houses required disinfection in 1886 compared with 176 in 1888; and that the houses supplied with disinfectants numbered but 487 in 1889 compared with 1,100 in 1888. This results from the great diminution in the numbers of those attacked by infectious disease in the year under report. The details of Sanitary operations for 1888 are included in the table as a useful means of comparison. Sewer The ill ventilated low level Main Sewer in York Ventilation Road and the Battersea Park Road, has during the year under report been the subject of numerous complaints. The great pressure which is always found to exist therein, probably due to the admission of heated effluent from factories, together with the chemical reactions which take place owing to the different composition of such effluents ; causes its serial contents to be forced up the tributary sewers, and the house drains of the houses in the adjacent streets, inmanycasesovercomingthe water seals of the gullies and traps and manifesting the presence of the sulphur compounds which result from the decomposition of human excreta by the blackening of the painted wood work of the doors and windows. This is evidence of defective ventilation of the sewer, and could be easily remedied by the provision 28 of a sufficient number of up-cast shafts to the tops of buildings in its line of route. The Battersea Bridge Road Sewer was for many years the subject of numerous complaints for identical reasons, but the erection of a few such ventilators removed the nuisance, and none have since been made. The London County Council, under whose control the low level Main Sewer is, have erected one such ventilator at the corner of Lockington Road with excellent results, but the whole line of Sewer requires similar treatment. It is to be hoped that the Council will see fit to order this to be done. If such ventilation were thoroughly effected, there would be no pressure upon the contents of the sewers and house drains in the localities lying on either side of the Main Sewer, and when it is remembered that the germs of many diseases may be conveyed by gaseous emanations from sewers, the importance of preventing their access to the houses of the inhabitants is manifest. Water The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company Supply. have announced their intention to extend a constant supply of water to the whole of the district, and active preparations are being made to provide the necessary fittings. It is to be hoped that the supply will really be constant in the ordinary acceptation of the term, as water undergoes much contamination by storage in dirty and improperly placed or badly cleansed cisterns. Another advantage which may be anticipated will be the disuse of the open reservoirs and filter beds at Nine Elms ; the water exposed in which must undergo great contamination by exposure to the atmosphere of a district surrounded by factories and houses. The water supplied by the Company is now to a great extent derived from underground sources, and not entirely from the river Thames, as formerly; such water is already filtered when caught, and not fouled by the drainage from the numerous towns and houses existing on the banks of the river 29 above the point of intake. Some such contamination may, of course, be derived from cesspools situated at a higher level than the underground source of supply, but analysis does not reveal any such pollution. It is extremely desirable that the Thames should not in the future be the source from which our supply of drinking water is obtained. By the constant supply, with the more rigid supervision as to waste, which is the invariable and necessary complement, the Water Company will save enormous quantities of water; such being the experience obtained in other districts in which constant service has existed for some time. The sewers will receive a correspondingly smaller quantity of water, which in dry and hot weather may possibly be of serious consequence ; it being of the highest importance that their contents should always be flowing, and never stagnant, in order to avert the formation of the so-called sewer gases. Cow and The whole of these premises have been inspected Slaughter . . Houses. from time to time, and the prescribed cleansing and lime washing carried out. It has not been necessary to oppose the renewal of any license. Bake- The Bakehouses have been subjected to similar supervision, and their sanitary condition is in striking contrast to that which existed some years ago. The more modern Bakehouses have generally been built above ground, and it is desirable that the building of underground Bakehouses should be prohibited for the future. Apart from the desirability of such factories being above ground, thus probably ensuring greater cleanliness in the manufacture of bread, there are several cases on record of workmen being asphyxiated by the carbonic acid gas which is evolved in large volume during its fermentation, some being within my own knowledge; as the workers in cold weather frequently close all apertures by which ventilation might be effected and go to sleep during the setting of the sponge, the result being fatal asphyxia from poisoning by carbonic acid gas, which being heavier than the air, by its greater ponderosity will drive out the latter from basements if proper through ventilation be arrested. 30 It will be seen that the Sanitary staff carries out its duties on a scale of yearly increasing magnitude. The Sanitary operations detailed in Table VIII; the duties of inspection under the Food and Drugs Acts; the inspection of new house drains ; the supervision of urinal and other Sanitary accommodation and the duties imposed by the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act have been performed in an efficient manner in addition to those undertaken by them at time of the separation of the parish from the Wandsworth District Board, by its transference to Schedule A of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The performance of these duties has, of course, fallen mainly upon Chief Inspector Richards, whose energy and devotion to the work of his office are above all praise, and I have again to record my entire approbation of his conduct. His assistants, Messrs. Freeman and Poole have afforded him great assistance and have got through a large amount of useful, but not always very pleasant, work to my satisfaction. The great professional experience of Mr. Pilditch, the Surveyor, has always been freely placed at my disposal, and I have to thank him for much valuable assistance during the year under report. Mr. Byworth, the Vestry Clerk, has, in spite of his numerous and onerous duties, rendered me valuable aid by his profound knowledge of the necessary procedure in Sanitary work, and with great ability and energy given me much highly appreciated help on numerous occasions. To the Members of the Vestry, and more especially to those constituting the Sanitary Committee, I may once more be permitted to express my sincere gratitude for the uniform support which has been extended to me ; which has enabled me to perform the duties with which I have been entrusted, the preservation of the health and the lives of the inhabitants of East Battersea; with the satisfactory results recorded in the preceding pages. W. H. KEMPSTER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health for East Battersea. 31 WEST BATTERSEA. In presenting the Twenty-first Annual Report for this District the Vestry may again congratulate itself and also the inhabitants, on the very high standard of health which has been maintained during the year. The year 1888 was exceptional as compared with former years, and it was scarcely to be expected that the favourable statistics then given would be maintained in the future ; it is, however, pleasing to relate that whether judged by the Birth rate, Death rate, or Sanitary condition, 1889 bears favourable comparison with any of the previous ones, and points forcibly that the measures taken by the Vestry and their Officers for the suppression of all those nuisances which may be and are prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants, have met with deserved success. The Births, notwithstanding the fact that many which used to be registered in this District, but owing to the removal of the Workhouse are now recorded in the Parish of Wandsworth, have fully maintained their numbers, and the rate is consequently high, whilst the mortality has but slightly increased. As will be seen further on in the Report the Sanitary Staff under the direction of the Inspector of Nuisances have done good work, which is fully set forth in Table VII. Two of the most noticeable matters which have come into operation during the year is the Notification of Disease Act, and the better facilities given for the removal of persons to Hospital. With regard to the former, which came into operation on October 30th, 1889, it has worked very satisfactory—has revealed the fact that not nearly so much epidemic disease exists as was imagined. No friction has occurred and 1 think the public as well as the Medical Attendants appreciate the assistance always offered, where required; but there is one defect in connection with it, it does not go far enough in 32 the diseases which have to be notified, two of the, if not the most important at all events in supplying by far the larger number of deaths, and left out, namely, Measles and Whooping Cough. From the latter, no less than iii fatal cases were returned; whilst from all the others under notification, there were but 32, leaving a balance to the credit of Measles, and Whooping Cough of 79, a fact which will at once attract the notice of those who take an interest in this subject ; and, I may further say, that this is not only the case this year, but is invariably so. The great benefit derived from this Act is that your Officers are at once made acquainted with the first case which occurs, and are enabled to take such measures as may be necessary for the immediate stamping out of the disease, and so prevent its dissemination by actual contact with the sick and healthy. As the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee remarked, a bucket of water would prevent a fire at the first onset, which subsequently would take many fire engines. Ambulance The facility given for the immediate removal of Service. persons suffering from Infectious disease have made rapid strides during the year; the old routine to which so many persons objected of first applying to the Relieving Officer has, with the exception of Paupers, been abandoned, and any medical practitioner can sign a certificate, have it conveyed to the Sanitary Inspector, and the case is at once dealt with. The Asylums Board also permit their Ambulances to be used by persons suffering from dangerous infectious disease, for their conveyance to places other than the Board's Hospitals, but for this a fee is charged; this charging of a fee is, I think, a mistake, and is under the consideration of the Asylums Board for remission. As the removal of infected persons is of such vital importance, I append for general information the regulations necessary to be followed in each case:— 33 Metropolitan Asglums Board. AMBULANCE SERVICE. Removal of Persons suffering from Infectious Diseases. 1.

(a) Only persons suffering from Smallpox, Fevers, or Diphtheria are Admitted into the Board's Hospitals. (b) Every application must state the name, age, and full address of the patient, from what disease suffering, and in cases of fever the particular kind of fever ; and also the name of the person making the application. (c) Unless a Medical Certificate be handed to the Ambulance Nurse the patient will not be removed. (d) Patients should leave all valuables, money, &c., and all outside clothing at home, should wear body linen only, and be wrapped in the blankets provided for the purpose (e) The Ambulance Nurse will leave, at the house from which the patient is removed, a notice stating the Hospital to which the patient is to be taken, and a copy of the regulations as to visiting, &c. 3. CONVEYANCE TO OTHER PLACES. (a) Persons suffering from any Dangerous Infectious Disorder may be Conveyed by Ambulance to Places other than the Board's Hospitals. N.B.—Dangerous Infectious Disorders include the following: Smallpox, Cholera, Diphtheria, Membranous 34 Croup, Erysipelas, Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever, Typhus, Typhoid, Enteric, Relapsing, Continued and Puerperal Fevers, and Measles. (b) Every application for an Ambulance must state:— (i.) Name, sex, and age of patient. (ii.) Description of disease, and, in the case of fever, the particular kind of fever. (iii.) Full address from which the patient is to be conveyed. (iv.) Full address to which the patient is to be conveyed. (c) The patient must be provided with a Medical Certificate of the nature of the disease, to be handed to the Driver of the Ambulance. (d) The charge for the hire of the Ambulance, including (when the patient is over ten years of age) the services of a male attendant is 5s. This amount must be paid to the Driver, who will give an official receipt for the same. (e) One person only will be allowed to accompany the patient, and such person may be conveyed back to the place from which the patient was conveyed. (/) The Ambulances may be sent outside the Metropolitan district only by special sanction of the Ambulance Committee or of the Clerk to the Board, and in such cases an extra charge will be made of is. for every mile outside the Metropolitan area. 4. The Drivers of the Board's Ambulances are not allowed to loiter 0:1 their journeys or to stop for refreshments on pain of instant dismissal. It is particularly requested that any breach of this regulation, or any neglect or incivility on the part of the Drivers, Nurses, or Attendants may be immediately reported to the undersigned. The Servants of the Board are forbidden to accept any gratuities or refreshments. by order, W. F. JEBB, Dated 16th December, 1889. Clerk to the Board. From the above it will be seen that the Asylums Board is now the body to provide accommodation, &c., for infectious diseases in the Metropolis, whether they come under the denomination of paupers or otherwise. 35 VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The population, estimated on the method pursued by the Registrar-General, viz.—that the rate of increase in the last decade has been maintained during the year 1889, would be 76,189. Knowing that the birth rate has fully maintained its high standard, the above estimate is not at all excessive, and when the Census which will be taken next year is revealed I believe it will be found that we are rather below than above the actual numbers. At the same time it is scarcely possible to prophecy with any degree of accuracy. Births. The Births returned as registered in this District was 2,750, of which 1,378 were males and 1,372 females, these numbers are 202 more than those of the preceding year, and this notwithstanding all births taking place in the Workhouse are now registered in Wandsworth Parish. The return for each quarter was as follows:— 1st Quarter 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter 747 650 662 691 Birth Rate. The Birth rate, presuming that the population has increased at the same ratio as in the decade of the last Census, is 36.1 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, that of the Metropolis being 30.3, the latter being the lowest ever recorded in London, which as the Registrar-General remarks has been continuously falling since 1876. This remark, however, does not apply to this District, for on looking back to 1880 I find the number of births was 1,838, and for the past year 2,750, so that in the place of decreasing there has been a steady and continuous increase. 36 The following table gives the birth and death rates for the past ten years. Years. Births. Birth-rate. Deaths from all Causes. Deathrate.

The deaths returned by the Registrar as having taken place in this district was i,o88, of which 524 were males, and 564 females. DeathRate. The above 1,088 deaths give a rate of 14.3 per 1,000 per annum. In the previous year, 1888, 1,049 were registered, therefore this year shows an increase of 39—and is entirely due to the mortality of summer Diarrhcea of 1889, which trebled that of 1888. 87 In addition to the above 1,088 deaths there occurred in Institutions within and without the District 184, of which 105 were males and 79 females, and were returned as the following Table sets forth.

Mortality The deaths from this class of disease were 217, of from Zymotic or which 112 were males and 105 females; this total Diseases. gives an excess of those of the previous year of 37. This excess is entirely due to summer diarrhoea, and accounts for the increase of this class of disease, and also the decimal in the general death rate—the greatest fatality was from Diarrhoea Measles and Whooping Cough, whilst other diseases remain about the normal average. Of the total number 95 were under one, 96 from one to five years of age, whilst from 20 and upwards but 26 were returned, thus conclusively showing, as in previous years, the age most susceptible to this class of disease. In reference to the deaths from Diarrhoea which were 74 out of the total, 55 were under one year of age, 14 from one to five, and five from 20 and upwards. The following table gives all deaths from Zymotic causes during the past ten years also the death-rate. TABLE III.

From diseases of the digestive organs 60 were returned, 25 males and 35 females—21 being under 1, 33 under 20 years of age, and 31, 20 and upwards. The deaths of infants from premature birth were 98. These are more numerous than last year and augment the number of deaths, and add more than one per 1,000 to the death rate.

Reverting to the opposite duration of life, we find 67 existed a few days, 20 a few hours, and eight a few minutes.

Enquiries were made on the bodies of 50 males and 29 females—in all 79, being 27 more than those of the previous year. The verdicts were as folows:— From Natural Causes 45 „ Accidental 20 Suicides 8 Murder 3 Neglect 2 Manslaughter 1 79 Of the accidental causes, ten were suffocated, five by falls, three run over, one jammed in a lift, and one poisoned. The suicides were eight, two cut throats, and three by poison, hanging and shooting one each, and one by throwing himself over a balcony. The verdicts of wilful murder were three, all against some persons unknown. Case "A." Male, newly born, found in Altenburg Gardens. Case "B." Female, newly born, found on Clapham. Common. Case "C." Male, newly born, found in Falcon Terrace. 42 Seven infants were suffocated whilst in bed with their parents, the dates and days being— 16th January, Wednesday. 25th February, Monday. 17th March, Sunday. 10th August, Saturday. 2nd November, Saturday. 24th November, Sunday. 1st December, Sunday. In addition to the above 14 cases of sudden death were submitted to the Coroner who did not deem any enquiry necessary. Natural The births returned as registered in the district Increase. being 2,750, and the deaths as 1,272, the difference would be 1,478, and constitutes the natural increase during the year, which is 132 in excess of the previous. Cases of The number of persons applying and receiving Sickness and Parochial Medical relief have again exceeded those amongst' of the previous year; indeed, ever since the estabUnion poor lishment of the Dispensary in Latchmere Road the cases have regularly year by year increased—in fact have doubled—so that in the past year they have reached the large total of 1,039, which five years ago was but 514. What the cause of this accelerated numbers may be, it is impossible to say, but it certainly does not speak well for any improved condition of the poorer classes, though I am bound to say that many of the poorer classes of Chelsea have migrated into this Parish since the demolition of houses on the estate near Chelsea Barracks, and that many of them apply to the Relieving Officer and so increase the numbers. Looking at the cases of Disease, it is pleasing to remark that, in those relating to the Zymotic or Epidemic Class, there has been a decrease, and that the increase has been solely in general complaints. Of the 1,039 treated, 29 died, giving a death rate of 2.8 per cent. 43 The following tabulated form gives the causes and number of deaths in each class:— Return of sickness and causes of death amongst the parish poor during the year 1889, under the treatment of the District Medical Officer for West Battersea, compiled from the medical relief books.

In the course of the various inspection of premises, it was found necessary to serve 1,700 first notices 44 for the remedying of defects found in their sanitary arrangements. In most of these cases the notices were complied with, but in 162 it was necessary to serve second notices, which, in all but 16, were complied with; in the latter, it was necessary to apply to the Magistrate for compulsory powers, which, in each case, was granted and enforced, so that it may be said that the 4,035 defects were eventually remedied. As those defects refer principally to the houses in which we live, and on which depends so much the health of the individual, too much importance cannot be attached to their abolition, and any work given to that object, or any expense incurred in its being carried out, is well spent. This is conclusively proved by the improvement of the health of the inhabitants, as shown by the mortality table during the past 10 years, fully set forth in the vital statistics accompanying this report. The total number of houses and premises inspected during the year was 12,998, or within two of 13,000; this total shows an increase on the previous year of 656, and resulted in the discovery and remedying of 4,035 defects; 132 houses were disinfected and cleansed after infectious disease; 524 were supplied with disinfectants, and no less than in 1,389 cases the sink and waste pipes were altered to discharge over gullies, or syphon traps fixed, thus cutting off any escape of Sewer Gas into the house, and freeing the inhabitants from a serious source of evil. It has but recently been admitted that the Sanitary Authority has the power to compel water to be laid on to closets; of course it goes without saying that this is an absolute necessity, alike for comfort and health, the enforcement of this power has resulted in water being laid on to 1,113 closets; this number is 698 more than those of the previous year. OverThere were twenty-two cases of overcrowding, the crowding. most prominent of which areas follows, and will show under what conditions some persons will live. Case "A." In a basement containing about 1,200 cubic feet a family consisting of the mother and seven children, the two 45 eldest being females 14 and 16 years, were living and sleeping. In addition, a man (not the father) slept with them. Notice was served and complied with. Case "B." A basement room was found to be occupied by a woman, two sons aged 17 and 20 years, two daughters aged 15 and 13 and one younger. Notice was served to relieve the congestion and complied with. Case "C." A room was found to be occupied by a man, his wife, a son aged 20, two daughters 18 and 13 and two younger children. The room contained 1,586 cubic feet.—Notice to discontinue was at once complied with. Cow and The whole were duly inspected and found to be in Slaughter Houses. good condition. Some cleansing was necessary which on request was readily complied with and no opposition to the licenses was made. BakeHave all undergone the usual inspections. Some Houses. new ones have been built and are in conformity with the Act of 1883. Fat boiling. Complaint was made of offensive effluvia being emitted from a yard at rear of Maysoule Cottages. Inspection was made, when it was found that a trade for the extraction of fat was being carried on without any license. Communication was at once made to the County Council, who rightly refused to grant a license and the factory was at once closed. Articles Articles of food ordered to be destroyed as unfit for destroyed as unlit for human food were:— food. 1 trunk of mackerel (60). 1 bag of mussels (about 3 bushels). 250 bad cocoa-nuts. 3 trunks of plaice. 42 fowls. In the latter case of the destruction of fowls the Vendor was summoned and the decision of the presiding Magistrate was so peculiar that for the information of all Vestrymen I deem it worthy of being set forth in this report. The Sanitary Committee took up the matter, and by their representation to the 46 Vestry the whole proceedings were placed before the Home Secretary. Report on Seizure of Putrid Fowls and the Magistrate's Decision thereon. Mr. Richards, the Inspector of Nuisances, reported to the Sanitary Committee that on Saturday night, the 4th May, about 10 o'clock he was present in the York Road, and saw Richard Garlic, of 108, Sheepcote Lane, with a pony and cart, selling fowls, that having ascertained that the fowls were putrid, he (the Inspector) endeavoured to seize them but Garlic jumped into the cart and drove away, the Inspector however succeeded in getting into the cart also, when Garlic drove furiously along York Road and Battersea Park Road, towards Culvert Road and back again, down Simpson Street, Henry Street, and Castle Street using threats to the Inspector meanwhile, upon reaching the corner of Althorpe Grove Garlic stopped the pony and the Inspector endeavoured to seize the fowls, Garlic resisting and a large crowd collecting sympathised with him; a policeman then appeared and the Inspector called him and explained the position of affairs and requested him to prevent a breach of the peace. The Inspector having removed about thirty of the fowls from the cart and placed them on the footpath, Garlic in the presence of the Constable thrust the Inspector violently aside and threw the fowls into the cart. The Inspector then requested the Constable to arrest Garlic but he refused to do so and went away. Garlic again jumped into the cart and drove off amidst cheers from the crowd. The pony was driven in the direction of Battersea Square, and when opposite the "Raven" public house, Garlic attacked the Inspector and endeavoured to throw him from the cart. After considerable difficulty the Inspector with the assistance of a few of the residents in the locality managed to get the pony and cart to the Stone Yard, and seized forty-two fowls which were submitted to me as the Medical Officer of Health, on the following morning. I declared them to be putrid and totally unfit for human food, and on 47 day the 6th May they were taken to the Magistrate at the Wandsworth Police Court who ordered them to be destroyed. The Committee directed that proceedings be taken against Richard Garlic for offering the fowls for sale, and also for obstructing the Inspector while endeavouring to seize the same ; they also considered the extreme danger to which the Inspector was exposed by the cowardly conduct of the police constable who refused to assist him when called upon to do so, and they directed that a communication be addressed to the local police authorities, with a view to ascertaining the name and number of the constable in question, and for a report upon the subject to be forwarded to the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis with a request that he would cause an investigation to be made. The Committee commended the Inspector for the courageous manner in which he effected the seizure. Garlic was summoned before the Magistrate for exposing for sale fowls unfit for the food of man, and for obstructing the Sanitary Inspector in the execution of his duty—both summonses were heard together, and the Solicitor to the Vestry having examined the Inspector, myself, and Mr. Ireland one of the witnesses to the obstruction, the Inspector proved the seizure and unfitness of the fowls for food, as likewise myself. The defendant thereupon called two witnesses; a woman who swore that she had purchased ten fowls for 5s., and a man that he had purchased six for 3s., both these persons swore that the fowls were fit to be eaten, that they had eaten them, and they were perfectly good; upon this evidence the Magistrate expressed his satisfaction that the fowls were fit to be eaten, and dismissed the summons for exposing the fowls, but fined the defendant £1 and 2s. costs in respect of the obstruction. Too much praise cannot be awarded to the Inspector for his conduct in this matter; the opinion he formed of the condition of these fowls as unfit for food, was correct, but it is extremely discomforting to be told, by a verdict given in court, that your evidence is not believed, as to unfitness for food, but 48 only that the defendant had no right to obstruct the Inspector in the performance of his duties. Notification of Infectious Disease. Since the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act came into force, October 30th, 1889, up to December 28th, 1889, the following cases have been notified, viz.:— 56 cases of Scarlet Fever. 56 ,, Diphtheria. 41 „ Erysipelas. 20 „ Typhoid Fever. 1 case of Puerperal Fever. Total number 174 Asylums' Board Hospitals. Infectious Diseases admitted to the Asylums Board's Hospitals during the year were:— Scarlet Fever 49 Enteric Fever 6 Diphtheria 6 61 Mortuary. In all, 140 bodies were received into the Mortuary during the year, six of which were placed therein for Sanitary purposes, and the remainder, 134, removed by the Coroner for the convenience of holding post mortem examinations, who now, in all urgent cases, orders the removal for the operations necessary previous to the enquiry being held. The removal of bodies by the Coroner, as expressed in previous year's reports, has my entire concurrence and should be encouraged, as it saves the Coroner and Jurymen much trouble and the possibility of being brought into actual contact with disease ; further, it has the effect of removing from the house, that which, if delayed must become most objectionable and a danger to health. It also enables Medical men to perform their operations under the most favourable conditions and removes all the objections which must exist if such examinations were carried out in a private house. Of the 140 bodies received, 82 were males, and 58 females, 49 The verdicts returned varied from in the case of the adult, of Natural or Accidental Causes of death, to that of the infant, who died of Wilful Murder by some person or persons unknown. The constant rule of the Coroner of ordering the removal of all bodies coming under his notice to the Mortuary, has pressed severely on our accommodation, which indeed at times has not been at all adequate. As an instance of which I would state that five bodies were removed on May 19th to the Mortuary, on which post mortem examinations had to be made. Two medical gentlemen met at the same time, one was using the post mortem table and the other had to use one of the dead house slates on which to perform his operations, without any convenience whatever and in the presence of other corpses in a most offensive and putrid state ; should this necessity occur during the period of an epidemic with infectious bodies lying therein the danger is impossible to estimate. This not only applies to the person who performs his official duties but to the friends and relatives who come to visit the remains of the poor departed, and it is a question which will sooner or later arise, as to the provision of an extra post mortem operating room, and also that of another chamber for the reception of persons dying from dangerous infectious disease, for it must be palpable to anyone, that persons visiting a mortuary in which bodies dying from infectious disease are deposited in one common chamber, that mischief will inevitably arise. There is, whilst on this subject another matter which should be mentioned on behalf of the Jurymen who have to view the remains before holding an inquest and that is, that a glass sliding window should be placed between the Mortuary proper and the post mortem room, so that the body might be viewed through the window and so prevent actual contact which at times must be very revolting to their feelings. Under the care of the late Mr. Saxby the Mortuary has been well kept and there was no fault to be found at the way he performed his duties therein. Inspection of new House Drains. 50 In respect to new house Drains, which only a short time ago were allowed to be laid down without any inspection at all, are now thoroughly examined by the Inspector of Nuisances before being covered up, who sees that they are properly laid, pipes jointed, &c. This will do away with a serious evil which has existed for years past, and so save the tenant who looks about for a house, and finds one neatly done up and in every way pleasing to the eye, falling into one of those death traps from which previously he had no protection ; nothing too detrimental can be said of imperfect drains running through a house, allowing escape of sewer gas with it, it is a very frequent cause of the general malaise, and often times more serious disease, such as diphtheria, typhoid fever, with which one is constantly brought in contact. In proof of the effects of bad drainage the case of one of the recent School Board Buildings may be mentioned. TABLE VII.

It can hardly be expected that such improvement can be continuous, but the Vestry may rest assured that its officers will continue to preserve the same active measures for the suppression of all those nuisances which are calculated to have an injurious effect on the welfare of the people. I have to express my thanks to the Vestry for the support always accorded me, and my satisfaction of the work done by Inspectors Crane and Young, also of Chief Inspector Richards, who with a considerable amount of increased duties has carried them out in a way which has commended itself.

CASSAL, F.I.C., F.C.S., Public Analyst. 3 VESTERY OFFICES Battersea Rise, S.W., June, 1890. Gentlemen, 1. During the year ended on the 31st March, 1890, one hundred and eight samples of Food have been submitted to me for Analysis, of which one hundred and six were obtained by your Sanitary Inspector, and two (of Milk) were submitted by " private purchasers." Two samples of water which were taken by order of the Sanitary Committee have also been analysed. 2. The foods consisted of 49 samples of milk, 24 of butter, 15 of coffee, 7 of black pepper, 4 of bread, 4 of tea, 3 of flour, 1 of cayenne pepper, and 1 of white pepper. They may be conveniently classified as follows:— Milk Foods (Milk and Butter) 73 — 67.6 per cent. Coffee and Tea 19= 17.6 ,, Condiments 9 = 8.3 ,, Cereal & Starchy Foods (Flour and Bread) 7 — 6.5 ,, 108 Taking the population of Battersea (in 1881) as 107,262, the number of samples of all kinds taken in the year is equal to one for every 993 persons. 3. Table I. shows the names and numbers of the samples taken during each quarter, 4 TABLE I. Ist Qr. 2nd Qr. 3rd qr. 4th Qr. Total.

It will therefore be seen that the Milks of bad quality, including Adulterated and Inferior samples, amounted to 59.2 per cent. of the number taken, as against 44.0 per cent. during 1888.89. 8. Adulterated Milk.—The twenty samples returned in Table II. as "Adulterated" had been tampered with at least to the extent indicated in the following Table (V.) In order to facilitate reference the quarters of the year in which each sample was taken are also given in this Table. Percentage of fat abstracted is calculated upon the amount of fat which should 6 have been present in the particular sample under examination, according to the percentages of other constituents found in it.

Total 20 9. Analytical Results.—The results in Table V. were calculated on the lowest admissible limits which were consistent with the Analytical data obtained; a fact which adds considerably to the significance of the figures. With reference to the lesser amounts reported, it should be noted that the percentages are only to be regarded as " small " when compared with the higher ones. Adulteration of Milk to such extents as will result in samples being reported, upon low limits of quality, as containing at least 3 or 5 per cent. of extraneous water or of having had at least 3 or 5 per cent. of the original fat abstracted, is extensively practised. 10. Milk from "Private Purchasers."—The two samples of Milk certified as Adulterated during the second quarter and marked with an asterisk (.) in Table V., were submitted for analysis by private purchasers in the parish. 7 The sample with at least 23 per cent. of the original fat abstracted was part of some Milk supplied to a large public establishment. The case would appear to afford another example of the manner in which contracts for the supply of certain foods to such establishments are carried out when, as is generally the case, no real check is kept upon the contractor, by systematic analysis. In some institutions it is the custom to " test " Milk by means of the so.called " Creamometers " or by the " Lactometer." It ought to be more generally known that these instruments give very illusory results, that their use does not constitute Analysis, and that they cannot, therefore, be relied upon in any way. 11. The sample containing at least 12 per cent. of water was taken from a can delivered at Clapham Junction Station. No information was received as to any proceedings in these cases. 12. " Private" Samples.—The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, enables any private purchaser in a district to submit a sample for analysis to the Public Analyst for that district, if the purchaser has conformed with the 12th and 14th Sections of the Act, and has prepaid a nominal sum, viz., 10s. 6d., for such analysis. It is well known that the intention of the Act is thereby to place the services of a Public Analyst—appointed by the Local Authority and receiving a salary from them—within the reach of any " private purchaser," and thus to encourage the public to assist the authority in checking adulteration. The public, however, have availed themselves but little of these privileges. It has always been found that a much larger proportion of the private than of the official samples were adulterated, one of the main reasons for this being that unless a private purchaser has strong grounds to suspect a vendor, he will not take the trouble to obtain an analysis. Under the Act the result of analysis of "private" samples, obtained as above, are to be included in the quarterly reports of Public Analysts. 13. Standards of Quality.—The composition of milk varies widely ; and in the absence of any legal limits below which 8 the percentages of Total Solid Matter, of Milk.Fat, and of other "proximate" constituents, should not be allowed to fall, it becomes a matter of necessity to calculate upon low standards of quality and to certify to minimum percentages when dealing with such adulterations as the admixture of water or the abstraction of milk.fat. The fixing of statutory limits for natural products varying widely in composition undoubtedly presents considerable difficulties, more especially in this country; but it has been done elsewhere, apparently with great benefit. In this country, anything of the kind would involve certain modifications of, and additions to, the existing Law, and would, no doubt, cast further duties upon Inspectors. The difficulties in the way are by no means to be regarded as insuperable. The main one is due to the variability of composition of the milk of individual cows, which is often very considerable. But the mixed milk of herds of cows, such as is used generally for public supply, presents comparatively small variations in composition. 14. Profits of Milk Adulteration.—In the Report of the Local Government Board for 1887 the following remarks are made upon the subject of Milk :—" The ease and the profit of milk adulteration are so considerable that the practice will not be easily suppressed. Assuming that the retailer buys milk at is. a gallon and retails it at 4d. a quart, his legitimate profit is 4d. a gallon ; but by adding one.eighth of water he makes nine pints out of every gallon, and thus his profit of 4d. is increased to 6d., a clear gain of 50 per cent. He can thus afford to pay fines, and go on adulterating." The fallacy of drawing conclusions as to the seriousness of adulteration from what appear to be small percentages has been pointed out in previous Reports to your Vestry. The Board's very apt and simple illustration renders this fallacy still more obvious. 15. "Inferior'' Milk.—The 7 samples returned as "Inferior and probably Adulterated," were of very bad quality ; all of them being exceedingly poor in Fat. In these cases the Milks had most probably been purposely deprived of some proportion .9 of their Fat, but the amounts left did not admit of the samples being reported as adulterated, having regard to the existing necessity for calculating results upon low standards of quality which has been alluded to above ; but it is altogether misleading to report Milks of this description as " Genuine," and it is important to ascertain, for administrative purposes, where and under what circumstances they were sold. A permanent record of these sales is of much value in the working of the Acts. 16. " Genuine " Mill;. — Of the 22 samples of Milk reported as "genuine," 6 were of good quality, 12 were of fair average quality, and 4 were poor Milks. BUTTER. 24 Samples. 1888.89. 1889.90. Genuine, 37.5 Per Cent. 45.8 Per Cent. Adulterated, 62.5 Per Cent. 54.2 Per Cent. 17. The thirteen samples reported as adulterated were all certified to be Margarine, under the Margarine Act of 1887. They were seized under the provisions of that Act, and each sample consisted chiefly of foreign fat; that is, each sample contained at least 90 per cent. of fat other than the fat of Butter; with one exception ; namely, a sample containing at least 70 per cent. of foreign fat. Under the Act a sample containing any proportion of fat other than butter.fat is to be regarded and certified as " Margarine." 18. The Act defines "Butter" as "the substance usually known as butter, made exclusively from Milk or Cream, or both." The word " Margarine " means "all substances, whether compounds or otherwise, prepared in imitation of Butter, and whether mixed with Butter or not, and no such substance shall be lawfully sold, except under the name of ' Margarine,' and under the conditions set forth in the Act." Any such substance not being marked according to the directions laid down in the Act is to be considered as being consigned, or exposed for sale, as " Butter." 10 19. The statement of a Vendor that he has sold " Margarine or his admission that he has exposed what he believes to be " Margarine " for sale as " Butter " (that is, without a label, or improperly labelled), is not sufficient to justify action, it being necessary that the substance shall be definitely proved to be " Margarine " by the Public Analyst's Certificate. 20. From the Local Government Board's returns it would appear that the adulteration of Butter, and the sale of Butter substitutes as Butter, are very extensively practised. COFFEE. 15 Samples. 21. The 8 samples reported as adulterated all contained Chicory in the following proportions at least, viz., 80, 60 (2 samples), 45, 40, 30, 20, and 7 per cent. 22. The 6 first.named samples were bought in Tins, the contents of which were in each case described by the word " Coffee," but the fact of admixture with Chicory was stated also upon the labels. Labelling as a " Mixture " is not to be regarded as a protection to the Vendors of such preparations. When the percentage of the adulterant exceeds a certain limit (to be determined by the discretion of the Magistrate) such a sale constitutes an offence under the 8th Section of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. The offence is obvious where the amount of the adulterant exceeds 50 per cent., although this percentage is not to be taken as the limit. Tea. 23. The sample returned as being of inferior quality probably contained some exhausted or inferior leaves, but not in quantity sufficient to constitute adulteration. BLACK PEPPER. 7 Samples. 24. The two samples reported as adulterated contained unduly 11 high proportions of total mineral matter and of silica and sand, viz:— Total Mineral Matter Silica and Sand per cent. per cent. 13.3 77 8.8 3.8 25. Genuine Commercial Black Pepper should not yield more than 5 to 5.5 per cent. of total mineral matter. Any sample yielding more than 7 per cent. is regarded as adulterated. An allowance of 1.5 to 2 per cent. is therefore made over and above the amount known to be yielded by Genuine Black Pepper. 26. The three samples reported as "Inferior" contained unduly high proportions of total mineral matter, but having regard to the above.mentioned limits, were not certified as adulterated. 27. As shown by Table II. the samples of Bread, Flour, White Pepper and Cayenne Pepper were all reported as Genuine. 28. Prosecutions were instituted by your Vestry against the vendors in all the more serious cases of adulteration, and in the other cases cautions were addressed to the persons concerned. I have been furnished with a return of the results which were obtained in the cases where legal action was taken, and for the sake of convenience they have been included in my Quarterly Reports to your Vestry, and are now embodied in the following Table (VI.), together with the cases where it was considered sufficient, for the present, to warn the Vendors.

Casks A & B.—In these cases the summonses were dismissed on the ground that the summons should state that the article had been sold to the " prejudice of the purchaser." Cases C & D.—These cases were dismissed on the ground that the article could not be seen in the shop, and that it was therefore not " exposed for sale." 13 29.. With respect to the prosecution of persons for selling Adulterated Pepper, the admixture of what appears to be a small percentage of refuse with Genuine Pepper may seem to be a trivial offence from the point of view of a single small purchaser. It must be remembered, however, that the Sale of Food and Drugs Act is the only existing check upon those, who, through the channel of certain retail dealers, succeed in disposing of large quantities of valueless material to the detriment of the public generally. 30. The Local Government Board recently requested Local Authorities to inform them of the results of any proceedings that may have been taken under the Acts, when forwarding the quarterly reports of their Public Analysts to the Board. The cautionary letters which were addressed by your Vestry to those Vendors against whom, for various reasons, it was not deemed advisable to institute proceedings, cannot have failed to produce a salutary effect. This action, as I understand it, is however, not to be taken to mean that the Vestry will decline to prosecute in all future cases which are similar as regards nature and extent of adulteration. 31. Fines.—In dealing with the fines inflicted, the Local Government Board in their report for 1887 concluded that in over 80 per cent. of the cases taken into Court during that year the average fine was only about £1, and went on to state that '• With magistrates thus lenient, it is not surprising that adulteration continues to a large extent unchecked." 32. The attention of your Vestry has been frequently called to the inadequacy of the fines inflicted in cases of adulteration. A more severe administration of the law would possibly result if the seriousness of the practice of adulteration was more clearly appreciated. 33. Striking instances of what may certainly be termed merely nominal fines are shewn in Table VI. The very bad cases of Milk and Butter Adulteration where such fines as 6d. and is. were imposed may be specially cited ; but the whole of the cases afford ample justification for the above.quoted remarks of the Board. 14 In the Local Government Board report for 1888 it appears that the average generally was about, but under, 27s. Excluding a comparatively small number of cases where the fines were unusually high, the average was only 18s. GENERAL REMARKS. 34. Samples examined in England and Wales. —During the year 1888—the last for which the returns have hitherto been received —the total number of samples of all kinds examined by the Public Analysts of England and Wales was 26,344, an increase of about 1,900 upon 1887. This is a large increase when compared with that of 1887 upon 1886 which was only 844. The data in the following table have been obtained from the reports for 1887 and 1888, and show the number of samples of each kind which were examined, and the number reported as adulterated in those years, with a comparison of percentages. The table also contains the percentages of adulteration for the five years 1877.81 and 1882.86. ARTICLES. No. of Samples in 1887. No. of Samples in 1888. Percentage adulterated in. Examined.

Totals 24,440 3,134 26,344 2,836 12.8 10.8 16.2 13.9 15 35. Lowest percentage.—The lowest percentage of Adulteration yet attained is that of 10.8 in 1888. In 1886 it was 11.9 and in 1887 it rose to 12.8. The improvement has been generally progressive. In 1877, when the results of the Analyses made under the Act of 1875 were for the first time tabulated, the percentage of adulterated samples was ig.2. This was of course a very high percentage, and it must be remembered that at that time the Act was very inadequately applied as compared with the present. 36. Metropolis.—The total number of samples of all kinds taken in the Metropolis in 1888 was 6,922, an increase of 520 upon 1887. Of these 761 were adulterated, as against 894 in 1887, giving a percentage of 11.0 for 1888, against 14.0 for 1887. 37. Milk and other Articles.—Although milk is the chief article dealt with, the high percentage of adulteration in other articles is very striking, and would certainly appear to justify the conclusion that these are at least as liable to the practice as milk ; and, it may be added, that the extra profit to those concerned is probably at least as large as in the case of milk, although not so obvious, and not so easy to illustrate. 38. "Private Purchasers."—As explained in another part of this Report, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, private purchasers have the privilege of submitting samples for analysis upon payment of a nominal sum. The intention was to encourage the public to assist the authorities in checking adulteration—one of the principles of the old Adulteration Act (1860) having been to leave to private purchasers the duty of taking samples. The fact that the public have availed themselves but very little of the provisions of the Act, is largely due, no doubt, to the unnecessarily cumbrous machinery provided. Of the 24,440 samples analysed during 1887 all but 287 were obtained by officers of Local Authorities. Of the 26,344 samples analysed in 1888, all but 164 were also obtained by such officers, and, as usual, a much larger proportion of the private than of the official samples were found adulterated. 16 WATER (2 Samples.) Nos. 110 and 111 39.—The examination of samples of Water is not included in the duties of Public Analysts, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act; but as two samples have been examined at the request of the Sanitary Committee during the year, it will no doubt be convenient to record the results in this Report:— Water, No. 110, obtained from a cistern in the Parish, was certified to be a polluted water, totally unfit for drinking purposes. Water, No. 111, which I am informed was obtained from the service-pipe supplying the above mentioned cistern, was certified as fit for drinking purposes. The analytical results in the case of " No. 111," showed that in composition and character it was an average specimen of the water supplied by some of the London Companies. It could be regarded as " sufficiently well-filtered" to admit of its use for drinking, in view of the general standards of quality allowed. The effect produced by the storage of the water in a polluted receptacle is clearly shown by the analysis and condemnation of "No. 110." The use of a water thus polluted is unquestionably dangerous to health ; the case is an illustration of the dangers of neglected cisterns, and of the importance of applying the constant supply system. 40. Extension of Public Analysis.—The extension of Public Analysis to other articles besides foods and drugs—although these afford, as it is, a very wide field of work—is urgently necessary. That necessity has of late years been very generally recognised in foreign countries, in some of which the laws against sophistication, using the word in an extended sense, are far more comprehensive and effective than in England. The Select Committee of 1874, upon whose report the Act of 1875 was based, stated, in effect, that the mere existence of the Acts of 1860 and 1872 had done much good, and that (in 1874) the public were, 17 upon the whole, " cheated rather than poisoned " by adulterators. It is not too much to say, from the experience of Analysts in their private capacities, that at the present time, in regard to numerous articles untouched by public analysis, the public are liable to be poisoned as well as cheated ; not, of course, "poisoned" in the violent sense of the term, except in comparatively rare instances, but injured in health by the habitual use of materials and preparations containing improper and sometimes absolutely dangerous ingredients ; and it appears to me to be the duty of those to whom these facts are known to take every opportunity of impressing them upon public authorities, as well as upon the public at large, with the view of ultimately obtaining satisfactory legislation on the subject. I desire to express my appreciation of the very efficient manner in which Mr. Richards, the Chief Inspector, and the Assistant Inspectors have carried out their duties under the Acts. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, CHARLES E. CASSAL, Public Analyst. 1 APPENDIX No. 6.
