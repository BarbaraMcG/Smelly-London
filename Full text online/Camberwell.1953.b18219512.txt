AC4376 5B 2 libariry Metropolitan Boroagh of Camberwell OF HEALTH HOWELL W. BARNES, B.A., M.B., B.Gh. D.P.H. Printed BY MERRITT & HATCHER LTD. London, CAM 48 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Camberwell, S.E.5. May, 1954. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for 1953 which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Ministry of Health Circular 1/54 dated the 12th January, 1954. As this is my last Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of Camberwell, it gives me great satisfaction to record that there was no serious outbreak of infectious disease during the year nor any other occurrence which interfered with the satisfactory maintenance of the good health of its inhabitants. It will be remembered that my Annual Report for 1951 presented a comprehensive survey of the Public Health Service of the Borough during the last 30 years and it would be pointless therefore to cover the ground again before my retirement. The Registrar-General's estimate of the population of the Borough at mid-year was 180,200 which is 1,000 less than the previous year's figure. The death rate dropped by one point to 12.1 deaths per thousand of the population. Slight decreases also occurred in the tuberculosis and maternal mortality rates. The infant death rate, however, increased from 23.6 in 1952 to 26.4 last year. The birth rate, which has been steadily falling since the end of World War II, continued its downward trend and dropped a further eight points to 15.3 per thousand of the population. Every endeavour was made to accelerate improvement in the housing situation by the provision of new accommodation under the building programmes of both the Borough Council and the London County Council. Action was also taken under the Public Health and Housing Acts to keep properties in a reasonable state of repair; closing and demolition orders were made in respect of houses and parts of buildings which could not be rendered fit at a reasonable expense and slum clearance operations were continued. The smoke-fog of December, 1952, which gave rise to such a sharp increase in the number of deaths in London stimulated interest in the subject of smoke abatement and much energy and research has been directed to the difficult problem of atmospheric pollution. The Council actively contributed to this campaign by purchasing and setting up within the Borough instruments for measuring the extent of atmospheric pollution and co-operating with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and other bodies in their endeavours to find a solution. May I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks and appreciation to the members of the Council for the consideration and encouragement that have been shown to me at all times. I am also grateful to the other Chief Officers and their staffs for the co-operation and assistance which have always been so willingly given. In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the Staff of the Public Health Department for the efficient manner in which they have discharged their duties. I have been fortunate in having a team of officers who have never spared themselves in the interests of public health and I am deeply indebted to them for their loyal service. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient Servant, H. W. BARNES, Medical Officer of Health. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. Constitution at the end of 1953. Chairman : Alderman A. F.

Population. The Registrar-General's estimate of the population of Camberwell at mid-1953 was 180,200. This shows a decrease of 1,000 on the previous year's estimate, but is still above the figure revealed by the Census in April, 1951, which was 179,777. For the past three or four years the population has remained fairly static, in the region of 180,000. The London County Report of the 1951 Census has now been published and contains some interesting and useful information. The table on the following page shows the acreage, population, private households and dwellings in each ward of the Borough. (Note.—As the Census was taken before the operation of The Camberwell (Councillors and Wards) Order, 1953, the particulars given are in respect of the Wards as constituted in 1951.) In the following table the population of the Borough as revealed by the Census is shown by sex and quinary age groups.

The number of infants who died before reaching the age of one year was 73. This was an increase of only 4 deaths as compared with the previous year, but resulted in a jump in the infantile death rate from 23.6 in 1952 to 26.4 in 1953 in view of the reduction in the number of live births. The former figure was the lowest infantile mortality rate ever recorded in Camberwell. Neo-natal deaths —that is deaths of children under one month—numbered 48. The following table shows the infant death rates for England and Wales, London and Camberwell during the past five years:— 1953 1952 1951 1950 1949 England and Wales 26.8 27.6 29.6 29 34 London 23.8 26.4 26 31 24.8 27 Camberwell 26.4 23.6 25.7 31 Maternal Mortality. As in the previous year, only two maternal deaths occurred in Camberwell during 1953. Owing to the fall in the number of births recorded, however, the maternal death rate increased from 0.67 to 0.70. The causes of these two deaths were internal haemorrhage due to ruptured ectopic pregnancy in one case, and acute hepatic necrosis and toxaemia of pregnancy in the other. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water Supply. No complaints were received during the year with regard to the purity of the water supply in Camberwell. Every dwelling house in the Borough has a service pipe direct from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. There are seven wells in operation in the Borough but the water from them is used for industrial purposes and not for domestic consumption. Water Certificates. There were 58 water certificates issued during 1953 under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. These involved 801 new dwellings. Drainage and Sewerage. Applications for approval in respect of the drainage of new buildings and alterations to the drainage of existing buildings numbered 107 during 1953. One thousand and eighty yards of sewers were reconstructed ; 69 brick road gullies were replaced by pot gullies and 4 defective pot gullies were renewed. Public Cleansing. The following information has been kindly furnished by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, who is the officer responsible for this service:— Amount of house refuse (including sal- vage and kitchen waste) collected during the year 42,397 tons Method of disposal Removed by barges from Honduras Wharf, Bankside, to a controlled tip. Frequency of collection weekly from dwelling houses and twice-weekly from blocks of flats and tenements. Smoke Abatement and Atmospheric Pollution. The authorities concerned gave a great deal of attention to this matter during the year and considerable research was carried out in connection with the effects of the smoke fog which occurred during December, 1952. A Government Committee was set up to investigate the problem of atmospheric pollution generally and it is anticipated that its report will lead to further legislation on this subject. During 1953,43 complaints were received of alleged nuisances from the emission of smoke and 83 observations were kept by the district sanitary inspectors. Where such complaints were found to be justified, steps were taken to secure the abatement of the nuisance. During the early part of the week commencing Monday, October 12th, a number of verbal and written complaints were received by the Public Health Department of nuisances from offensive odours during the preceding weekend. These odours were mainly described as sulphurous and choking in character and in some instances were stated to have caused vomiting. The complaints were not confined to any particular area of the Borough, but were widespread throughout Peckham and Dulwich. It was, therefore, apparent that the nuisance could not be attributed to emissions from a local factory as was alleged by at least one complainant. Enquiries made at the Public Health Departments of adjoining Boroughs elicited information that they had received similar complaints. The Meteorological Office reported that atmospheric conditions during the weekend in question were conducive to fog ; it was mild, with very little wind ; humidity, although low on the Saturday morning, was high the following day, and there was inversion in temperature. The conclusion arrived at, therefore, was that the atmospheric conditions gave rise to an abnormal concentration of oxides of sulphur emitted from chimneys which caused a feeling of choking and irritation of the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Fortunately, on Tuesday, 13th October, there was heavy rainfall which washed these impurities from the atmosphere and no further complaints were received. There is, however, the possibility of a recurrence of this concentration of impurities in the air whenever atmospheric conditions are favourable. Normally, rising smoke reaches air of a lower temperature. During fog, however, fall in atmospheric temperature with increase of altitude may be negligible or there may be an inversion and the atmospheric temperature increase with height. Under these conditions, smoke will not rise and will tend to fall, thus resulting in a concentration of impurities in the air at a low level. One of the main causes of atmospheric pollution is the burning of coal; the more inferior the coal (e.g., nutty slack) the greater the pollution. Other causes of pollution are the gases discharged from the engines of the numerous omnibuses and motor vehicles on the road. It has been estimated that two million tons of smoke are emitted into the air annually, more than half of which is the result of domestic fires. Factories, railway locomotives, motor vehicles, etc., are responsible for the remainder. Atmospheric pollution, whatever may be the cause, results in the loss of daylight, the erosion of metals, damage to plant life and, without doubt, has a deleterious effect on health owing to the aggravation of already existing heart or lung disorders. Standardised methods for measuring atmospheric pollution have been evolved. The main instruments used are a deposit gauge, a smoke filter, a volumetric and a lead peroxide method for the determination of sulphur dioxide. A number of atmospheric pollution measuring stations have been set up in London and other parts of the country. This Council has already purchased a deposit gauge and lead peroxide instrument which, on the advice of the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and by arrangement with the London County Council, are sited on the roof of the Queen's Road Centre, St. Mary's Road, Peckham. The deposit gauge is an apparatus designed to collect solid and liquid material (i.e., rain-water) which is measured, the acidity or alkalinity determined together with the amount of soluble and insoluble matter. The lead peroxide instrument is used as a means of estimating the relative concentration of sulphur dioxide in the air. The contents of these instruments are submitted to the Public Analyst monthly and the results of his examinations are forwarded to the Fuel Research Station. The following table sets out the Public Analyst's findings since the instruments were set up on 1st June, 1953. The monthly deposited matter, expressed in tons per square mile is divided into total insoluble and total soluble deposit. The sulphur dioxide figures give a rate of sulphation as measured by the lead peroxide instrument and are expressed in milligrams of SO 3 per day per 100 square centimetres of lead peroxide.

Insoluble Deposit Soluble Deposit Total Solids SO3 mg/day 100 cm2 Tons per sq. mile 5.97 June 33 8.74 14.71 1.04 8.17 July 82 10.24 18.41 0.58 August 5.57 2.97 39 8.54 0.76 September 39 8.04 5.44 13.48 1.02 October 69 10.93 8.00 18.93 2.43 November 4.10 41 6.47 10.57 2.39 December 15 7.64 10.87 18.51 3.35 Bombed Sites and Static Water Tanks. Complaints continued to be received with regard to nuisances arising from offensive refuse deposited on bombed sites and in 13 instances the Borough Engineer and Surveyor was requested to arrange for its removal. The accumulation of stagnant water and refuse in static water tanks also gave rise to public health nuisances, and in 12 cases the London Fire Brigade was asked to co-operate by arranging for the water to be pumped out, after which the refuse was removed by this Council's employees. As the result of negotiations between the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee and the London County Council, arrangements were made whereby the County Council reimburse the Borough Council the cost reasonably incurred in cleansing emergency water tanks. Swimming Bath Waters. The following table shows the number of samples of swimming bath water from the Council's Baths submitted for bacteriological and chemical examination during 1953. Bacteriological Examination Chemical Examination Camberwell Front Swimming Bath 5 5 Camberwell Rear Swimming Bath 12 12 Dulwich 1st Class Swimming Bath 5 5 Dulwich 2nd Class Swimming Bath 5 5 27 27 Totals The reports on all the above samples indicated that the waters were in a satisfactory condition. Samples of water from the swimming bath at the Mary Datchelor Girls' School, Camberwell Grove, were obtained on three occasions during the year. The bacteriological and chemical examination reports were satisfactory in every case, except for adjustments to the free chlorine content. The Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 At the end of the year there were 7 premises registered under the provisions of the above Act. The Sampling Officer obtained 27 samples of filling materials from these premises for submission to the Prescribed Analyst. The number and type of the samples examined are indicated in the following table:— Rag flock (loose) 7 Rag flock (layered) 5 Woollen mixture felt 3 Washed jute felt 1 Grey wadding (cotton felt) 2 Cotton felt 1 Hair (loose) 1 Hair (pad) 1 Fibre (loose) 3 Coir fibre (pad) 1 Kapok 2 Total 27 Two of these samples did not comply with the standards of composition and purity laid down in the made under the above Act, and on the instructions of the Public Health Committee cautionary letters were sent to the firms concerned. Offensive Trades. At the end of the year there were only 5 premises in the Borough registered for the conduct of offensive trades as follows:— Skin dressers 4 Soap boilers 1 These premises were kept under supervision by the District Sanitary Inspectors, but no infringements of the Bye-laws were reported. On investigatiing a complaint of offensive smells emanating from premises in Addington Square, it was found that such premises were being used for the purpose of conducting an offensive trade, to wit, drying sheepskins, without application having been made to this Authority for consent to establish such a business as required by Section 140 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Legal proceedings were taken against the proprietors of the business and a fine of £10 with £6 6s. costs was imposed. The conduct of the offensive trade was discontinued. Caravans on Bombed Sites. A number of complaints were received during the year with regard to the use of a bombed site at the corner of Coldharbour Lane and Crawford Road by persons living in movable dwellings (caravans, converted motor coaches, etc.). No statutory action could be taken by this Council as no public health nuisance arose, nor was there any contravention of the appropriate bye-laws. The attention of the London County Council was, therefore, drawn to this matter, as it was understood that an application under the Town Planning Acts for consent to use this land as a caravan site had been refused. Shops Act, 1950. The local sanitary authority is responsible for the provisions of the above Act which relate to temperature and sanitary accommodation in shops. The district sanitary inspectors made 435 visits of inspection during the year and two notices were served for contraventions of the Act, which were complied with. There were no applications for the issue by the Council of exemption certificates under the provisions of Section 38 (6) of the Act. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. Nineteen new applications were received during the year for registration as sellers of poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List prepared under the provisions of this Act. In addition, 184 applications were received for the annual renewal of registrations. The premises concerned were kept under supervision by the district sanitary inspectors but no contravention of the statutory requirements were reported. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. Difficulty continued to be experienced in securing the services of qualified sanitary inspectors and the number of these officers was below the authorised establishment during the whole of the year. Complaints received during 1953 numbered 5,385. The visits made by the sanitary inspectors, which totalled 31,996, are summarised in the following table: — SUMMARY OF WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE YEAR 1953.

The following table shows the number of outworkers in Camberwell at the end of the year classified by the occupations in which they were employed:— Artificial flowers 2 Linens 2 Baby linen 19 Needlework 4 Belts 2 Novelties 17 Blouses 5 Overalls 16 Boots and shoes 6 Paper bags 8 Shoulder pads 34 Brushes 2 Cardboard boxes 34 Tailoring 19 Card lacing 72 Ties 8 Embroidery 4 Toys 1 Feather sorting 3 Umbrellas 2 Handbags 7 Uniform caps 7 Hats 5 Wearing apparel 455 Miscellaneous 43 Hosiery 2 Industrial Gloves 4 Lampshades 8 Total 791 Pet Animals Act, 1952. Two applications were received during the year for the issue of licences under the provisions of the above Act, and there were 14 applications for the annual renewal of licences. At the end of the year there were 15 licensed pet shops in the Borough, one having been discontinued. All these premises were kept under supervision by the district sanitary inspectors, but it did not become necessary to take action for any infringement of the statutory requirements or contravention of the conditions of the licence. GENERAL PROVISION FOR HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA. Welfare of Aged Persons. The Camberwell Old People's Welfare Association which is supported by a financial grant from the Borough Council, undertakes various services for the comfort and well-being of old persons residing in the Borough. Particulars of some of these services are set out in the following paragraphs. Meals on Wheels and Dinner Clubs. The "Meals on Wheels" Service provides for hot mid-day meals to be delivered to the homes of those old people who are unable to cook for themselves or attend a dinner club. The meals were collected from the union of Girls' Schools Settlement, Staffordshire Street, and from the L.C.C. Londoners' Meals Service Restaurant at Grafton Hall, Village Way, S.E.21, and were distributed by one van belonging to the Old People's Welfare Association, one van (with driver) loaned by the Council for approximately 2 hours on four days each week, and by the Women's Voluntary Services volunteer cars. Approximately 15,000 meals were supplied in this way to old people in Camberwell during 1953, at a reduced charge. In the case of meals collected from the Londoners' Meals Service, the balance of the cost of each meal was borne by the London County Council. There are also three dinner clubs in the Borough which cater for old people's mid-day meals at a reduced charge. These are situated at the U.G.S. Settlement, Staffordshire Street, Peckham, the Women's Voluntary Services, 47, Camberwell Church Street, and Troy Town Old People's Club. Old People's Clubs. There were 19 old people's clubs in the Borough at the end of 1953. Their social activities provide a welcome diversion for many old persons who live alone and by stimulating and maintaining their interest, assist in preventing them from detiorating in their general health and habits from apathy of the aged. In addition to providing recreation and entertainment, many of these Clubs encourage their members to take up hobbies such as knitting, needlework, raffia work, etc. On Saturday, 16th May, the Camberwell Old People's Welfare Association arranged an exhibition at the South London Art Gallery at which were displayed many items of handiwork by members of Old People's Clubs throughout the Borough. Interesting contributions to this exhibition, which was attended by approximately 3,000 visitors, were also made by the Borough Council, the London County Council, Camberwell Hospitals Management Committee, Women's Voluntary Services, the British Red Cross Society, and other organisations. Mobile Library Service. The Council has provided a Mobile Library which visits the homes of aged and infirm persons and supplies a welcome relief from the monotony and loneliness of their lives. This service, which is under the control of the Libraries Department, is greatly appreciated by the persons who take advantage of its facilities. Chiropody. Care of the feet is very important for old people, but presents a serious problem as advancing age renders it increasingly more difficult to give attention to one's own feet. In order to deal with this problem, Chiropody Clinics for Old People have been established as follows:— British Red Cross Society, 160, Peckham Rye, S.E.22. U.G.S. Settlement, Staffordshire Street, S.E.15. Cambridge House, 131/139, Camberwell Road, S.E.5 (for members of its Old People's Club only). C.O.P.W.A. at W.V.S., 47, Camberwell Church Street, S.E.5. In addition, a Mobile Chiropody Clinic has been provided by C.O.P.W.A. to visit the homes of old persons who are unable to attend at one of the above Clinies. Old Persons' " S.O.S." Scheme. This Scheme, which has been put into operation by the Old People's Welfare Association, provides for old people living alone to be supplied with a card bearing the inscription "S.O.S." in large red letters with wording below informing the reader that an old person is in urgent need of assistance. In the event of sudden illness this card may be placed in the window to summon assistance from passers-by. Space is provided on the reverse side of the card for the insertion of information as to the old person's doctor, nearest relative, etc. Night Sitter-in Service. Both the London County Council and the Camberwell Old People's Welfare Association have made arrangements for attendants to sit up throughout the night with elderly invalids in emergency cases or where relatives or friends, who are caring for the old person, are in need of a few nights' rest. Holidays for Old People. In the early part of the year the Council gave consideration to the establishment of a Holiday Home for Old People somewhere on the coast. In view of the approach of the summer months, however, it was decided to adjourn the matter until the autumn and a grant of £500 was made to the Camberwell Old People's Welfare Association to be spent in providing holidays for old people at suitable boarding houses, etc. One hundred old people were sent away for a fortnight's holiday under this Scheme and in view of its success no further action was taken in relation to the setting up of a holiday home under the aegis of the Council. Domiciliary Assistance and Supervision. The district sanitary inspectors paid 125 visits to old people known to the Department, The object of these visits was to ensure that the old people were not living in insanitary conditions and to report on their needs, such as home help or home nursing services, etc., thus endeavouring to prevent the necessity arising for securing the compulsory removal of any aged and infirm person to an old people's home. It is gratifying to record that in no instance during the year was it necessary to invoke the provisions of the National Assistance Act, 1948, for this purpose. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. This Act, which came into operation on 23rd March, 1953, prohibits the sale or letting under Hire Purchase in the course of business, all gas fires, electric fires or oil heaters without guards or fitted with guards which do not comply with the standards prescribed by regulations made by the Home Secretary. These regulations, known as the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Regulations, 1953, came into operation on 1st October, 1953, and require every heating appliance to which the Act relates to be fitted with a guard which shall be robustly made and of such standard of construction and fitting as is specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. The Schedule also describes certain tests to be employed in ascertaining whether guards comply with the standard laid down. There is, however, a provision in Regulation 5 that heating appliances, other than imported appliances, which were manufactured before the date of the coming into operation of the Regulations and not fitted with the requisite guard may be sold or let until the end of September, 1954. In view of this provision, there appeared to be little point in carrying out any inspections or tests before the end of the year, and the officers of the Public Health Department therefore confined their activities in this matter to the preparation of a card index of premises where heating appliances are sold or exposed for sale in order to facilitate the administrative arrangements for ensuring compliance with this new legislation. Accidents in the Home. Following the publication of the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee, the Home Office issued copies to Local Authorities with a Circular suggesting that advice on this subject might well be effectively disseminated by Medical Officers of Health and other public health workers, and could be included in any general publicity on the prevention of illness, etc. Accordingly, some notes on this subject were included in the Council's Booklet on the Health and Social Services in the Borough when it was re-printed and brought up to date. One of the exhibitions which it is customary to arrange on evenings when the Council meets was also devoted to this subject, the material being kindly loaned by the Crusader Insurance Company. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1951. The Rodent Control Staff continued to wage a vigorous campaign against rats and mice during the year. The following is a summary of their work during the past three years:— 1951 1952 1953 No. of complaints received 1,383 1,383 1,370 No. of inspections 2.709 2.802 2.391 No. of operators' calls 20,257 21,473 19,340 No. of private premises baited 1,427 1,484 1,280 No. of business premises baited 216 281 183 No. of pre-baits laid 49,898 39,884 31,101 No. of poison baits laid 23,886 16,959 16,040 In 48 cases where the rat infestation was suspected to be due to defective drains, such drains were tested and in 22 instances positive results were obtained. Half-yearly sewer maintenance treatments were carried out during June and December but systematic block treatments of sewers was continuous throughout the year. Occupiers of 172 dwelling houses which were infested with mice were supplied by the Public Health Department with 377 packets of poison baits (totalling 1,508 baits). The annual return on page 25 has been prepared on the lines required by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Following a recommendation by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries that local authorities should use bread rusk as a base for rat baits, the Public Health Committee early in the year authorised the purchase of a mincing machine to produce bread rusk from stale bread in view of the high cost of purchasing this material commercially. This experiment was so successful and effected such a financial saving that, at the suggestion of the Ministry, the Rodent Officer prepared an article on this method of producing bread rusk which was published in the Municipal Engineering Journal in order that the matter might be brought to the notice of other local authorities. A few months later the Committee authorised the installation of an electricity supply to the bait-preparing room at 6, Artichoke Place and the purchase of an electric motor to operate the mincing machine. Disinfecting and Cleansing Station. The following tables show the number of attendances for treatment made at the Municipal Cleansing Station, Frensham Street, Peckham Park Road, S.E.15, during the year, by residents affected with vermin or scabies: — CLEANSING STATION ATTENDANCES (VERMIN) Male.

Advice and information on health matters were publicised by the display of posters and issue of pamphlets at Dulwich, Nunhead, Livesey and North Camberwell Libraries as well as at the Town Hall. The subject matter, which was changed periodically, included diphtheria immunisation, poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis), influenza, clean food, etc. Copies of a booklet prepared by the Public Health Department on the Health and Social Services in the Borough were distributed through the medium of the Public Libraries, Information Centre, Infant Welfare Centres, District Nursing Associations, and various voluntary organisations. During the year talks on the Public Health Services were also given by a senior officer of the department to pupils at a local girls' school, the Denmark Hill Branch of Toe H and at Scout Troop at Dulwich College. At the request of the Camberwell Hospitals Management Committee, following the issue of a circular by the Regional Hospitals Board on Hygiene in Hospital Catering Departments, lectures on food hygiene were given by the Medical Officer of Health to the catering staffs at Dulwich, St. Francis' and St. Giles' Hospitals. Individual instruction was also given hy the Sanitary Inspectors in the course of their visits to dwelling houses, food premises, shops, factories, etc. HOUSING. New Dwellings. Under the Council's Building Schemes 141 new dwellings were completed during the year and 932 were under construction at the end of the year. At 31st December there were 7,241 tenancies under the Council's control in all types of properties, including 1,527 permanent dwellings and 519 prefabricated bungalows. Requisitioned Properties. Close co-operation exists between the Public Health Department and the Housing Department in relation to requisitioned properties. Where sanitary nuisances in Council-controlled houses are brought to the notice of the Sanitary Inspectors, a memorandum specifying such nuisances is forwarded to the Housing Department for attention. Two hundred and sixty-one memoranda were passed to the Housing Department during 1953. The Housing Department notify the Public Health Department in all cases where it is proposed to de-requisition a house owing to its bad condition, in order that the premises may be inspected from the point of view of dealing with them under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936. Information of 21 such properties were received by the Public Health Department during the year. At the request of the Housing Department inspections are made by officers of the Public Health Department of underground rooms, basements and parts of requisitioned properties to see whether they are fit for human habitation within the meaning of the Housing Acts. Sixty-one parts of premises were inspected in this way during the year under review and in 24 instances the Director of Housing was notified that they were unfit. Slum Clearance. Under the five-year Slum Clearance Programme agreed between the Borough Council and the London County Council, no areas were due to be declared by this Authority during the year under review. The Council gave further consideration to the Astley Street Clearance Area with a view to its acquisition together with other properties in the vicinity, for the purpose of developing the site for housing. At the end of the year negotiations had proceeded to an advanced stage. The two houses in the Sandgate Street Area, which was also represented at the end of 1952, were demolished after the occupants had been rehoused by the London County Council. Housing Survey. The Housing Repairs and Rents Bill, which came before Parliament at the end of the year contained provisions requiring local authorities to survey their districts and formulate proposals for dealing with unfit houses for submission to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. In anticipation of this becoming law, the Council's Inspectors commenced a preliminary survey of the Borough. Individual Unfit Houses capable of being rendered fit at reasonable expense. Ten formal and four informal notices were served under the provisions of Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936, in respect of houses which were unfit for human habitation but were capable of being rendered fit at a reasonable expense. Seventeen unfit houses were rendered fit during the year— six by informal action and 11 by statutory action. Of the latter, six were repaired by the owners and five by the Council in default of the owners. Individual Unfit Houses not capable of being rendered fit at reasonable expense. Only one demolition order was made during the year in respect of a dwelling house which was not capable of being rendered fit for human habitation at a reasonable expense. Two houses were demolished and two houses made fit by the owners following action by the Council under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936. In addition, two undertakings by owners were accepted by the Council to render premises fit for habitation. Underground Rooms and parts of Premises. Closing Orders were made by the Council in respect of 25 underground rooms and parts of premises which were unfit for human habitation. In one instance a Closing Order was determined following action by the owner to render fit the underground room. Record of Work carried out during 1953 by the Council's Housing Inspector.

During 1953, 135 cases of statutory overcrowding came to the notice of the Public Health Department, and certificates of overcrowding were forwarded to the Housing Departments of both the Borough Council and the London County Council in support of housing applications by the families concerned. In one instance, it was necessary for a statutory notice to be served requiring the abatement of overcrowding which was complied with. A total of 101 overcrowded families were provided with alternative accommodation during the year—53 by the London County Council and 48 by the Borough Council. The figures on page 32, which have been extracted from the London County Report of the Census, 1951, give some idea of the distribution of families in dwellings of varying sizes. They do not, however, indicate the number of cases of statutory overcrowding as room sizes are disregarded and the number of persons in the household is actual and not equivalent, i.e., children under ten years of age are included as " persons," whereas for the purposes of ascertaining overcrowding a child between one and ten years is counted as half a unit and a child under one year is disregarded.

During 1953, the Medical Officer of Health dealt with 508 applications in this way. Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. Twenty Certificates of disrepair were issued under the above Act during the year under review following applications by the tenants of dwelling houses in the Borough. Common Lodging House. There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough of Camberwell. This is situated at 124, Camberwell Road and is licensed for the accommodation of 224 male persons. The district sanitary inspector made 37 visits of inspection during the year, and at all times found the premises to be well-conducted, clean and in a satisfactory state of repair. As a precaution against possible infestation by vermin, this lodging house is sprayed every month by the Council's Disinfecting Staff, on payment by the owners of an agreed charge. NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Two thousand, three hundred and forty-one notifications of infectious disease were received during the year and in 18 instances the patients were subsequently found not to be suffering from the disease. This compares with 2,720 for the previous year, with 26 amended diagnoses. The decrease was mainly due to a reduction in the number of cases of measles which occurs epidemically every other year. A summary of the notifications by diseases and age groups appears on the following page. The Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1953. These Regulations, which came into operation on 1st April, 1953, revoke and substantially re-enact the former Regulations in a form to accord with the present shape and working of the health service. They require the notification of malaria, dysentery, acute primary and acute influenzal pneumonia, and provide for preventive steps against the spread of certain diseases. The Regulations amplify the precautionary measures against food poisoning : — (1) by relating these (instead of to enteric fever and dysentery, as formerly) to typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever or other salmonella infections (which includes the diseases previously known as enteric fever), dysentery and staphylococcal infections likely to cause food poisoning ; (2) by applying these measures in general to persons shown to be carriers of these diseases as well as to persons suffering from them ; (3) by preventing such persons (in either class) not only from continuing employment involving the handling of food, as formerly, but also from entering such employment; and (4) by enabling a local authority to authorise the Medical Officer of Health to issue notices in emergency, in order to check the spread of these diseases. In accordance with the requirements of the Regulations, a copy of them was sent to each medical practitioner practising in the Borough. Diphtheria. No confirmed case of diptheria occurred in Camberwell during the year. Although this is the third consecutive year free from this disease, there has been no slackening in the intensity of the diphtheria immunisation publicity campaign. The remarkable reduction in the incidence of this disease which has occurred during the past few years should not be allowed to INFECTIOUS DISEASES, 1953.

It is still of the utmost importance to ensure that the highest possible proportion of the child population is protected against diphtheria and parents should be constantly reminded that it is their duty to their children to take advantage of the immunisation facilties provided by local health authorities. Poliomyelitis and Polio-encephalitis. There was an increase in the number of confirmed cases of this disease during the year —20 as compared with five in 1952 —the highest figure reached since the epidemics of 1947 and 1949. The following table shows the number of confirmed cases of poliomyelitis and polio-encephalitis which have occurred each year since 1947. 1947 34 1948 8 1949 26 1950 16 1951 8 1952 5 1953 20 Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever. Two notifications of typhoid and one of paratyphoid fever were received during the year. In one case of typhoid it was discovered that the patient had been on holiday in Italy, where the disease was probably contracted, and in the other instance, the patient was subsequently found not to be suffering from the disease notified. All efforts to trace the source of infection in the paratyphoid case were unsuccessful. Smallpox. No case of this disease occurred in the Borough during the year, although small outbreaks occurred in Yorkshire and Lancashire and it was necessary to keep two Camberwell contacts under surveillance. Four persons who proceeded to addresses in Camberwell on disembarking from a ship from India in which a case of smallpox had occurred were also visited daily by the district Sanitary Inspectors until all danger of contracting the disease had passed. Diarrhoea and Enteritis. An outbreak of enteritis, mild in character, occurred in a Nuns' Home in the Borough. Forty of the 60 persons in the Home were affected. Investigations led to the conclusion that the cause of the outbreak was probably due to a " carrier" working in the kitchen. Rectal swabs were taken from the catering staff and examined for dysentery bacillus but the results proved to be negative. The Consultant Physician at St. Giles' Hospital reported to the Medical Officer of Health that cases of diarrhoea were occurring periodically among patients and staff at the hospital. The possibility of a " carrier " being engaged in the preparation of food was investigated. One male member of the catering staff had a history of recent diarrhoea and arrangements were made for rectal swabs to be taken and examined bacteriologically. The man concerned was not allowed to handle foodstuffs until negative results were obtained. Arrangements were also made for each member of the catering staff to be interviewed to ensure that nobody engaged in handling or preparing food was working with diarrhoea, boils or septic spots. The question was raised with the Secretary of the Camberwell Hospitals Management Committee as to the advisability of hygiene being taught to the members of the kitchen staffs at the hospitals. Food Poisoning. One hundred and sixty-five notifications of food poisoning were received during the year. The following is a copy of the Annual Return of Food Poisoning notifications which was forwarded to the Ministry of Health in accordance with Circular 46/49 and Memo 188/Med, dated 24th May, 1949. 1.

Total: 30. † 6 of these were resident in the Borough of Southwark and 10 in the Borough of Lambeth. * None of these cases was notified. The large number of notifications received during the third quarter was mainly due to an outbreak of food poisoning at two schools in the north-western area of the Borough. Many of the pupils and staff were taken ill with vomiting after consumption of the mid-day meal which had been prepared in one of the school kitchens. Investigations showed that the meal included custard and prepared cream made from dried milk powder. Some of the custard and dried milk was submitted for bacteriological examination which revelaed a high count of staphylococcus aureus. Prompt action was taken by the London County Council who took steps to recall from the Schools Meals Service all packs of dried milk from the same source. Fortunately, the illness was not severe and nearly all the patients recovered within 24 hours. An outbreak of food poisoning was also reported at St. Francis' Hospital, where 27 patients were taken ill with diarrhoea, and in some cases slight sickness, following the consumption of an evening meal consisting of meat pie and meat hash. Unfortunately, none of the food remained available for examination. Specimens of stools from the patients were submitted to the laboratory, however, but the results proved to be negative. Inquiries revealed that all the kitchen staff concerned were in good health. It was not possible, therefore, to discover the agent responsible for this outbreak. TUBERCULOSIS. There was a considerable fall in the number of primary notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis received during the year —286, as compared with 377 in 1952. Notifications of nonpulmonary tuberculosis numbered 20—three less than the previous year. TABLE SHOWING SEX AND AGE DISTRIBUTION OF ALL PRIMARY NOTIFICATIONS AND DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOSIS DURING 1953.

The election of Councillor Miss Rosina Whyatt as Mayor of Camberwell caused a vacancy on the Committee. Alderman Mrs. Jessie Burgess, J.P., a past member of the Committee for many years, was appointed in her place to represent the Divisional Health Committee, L.C.C., Division 7. The Committee placed on record their pleasure in the election of Councillor Miss Rosina Whyatt as first citizen of the Borough. At the close of the year, Mrs. Margaret Manning, who was a representative of the Camberwell Borough Council, resigned from the Committee, having left the district. A nomination from the Council was awaited. The Committee added to their customary work by the provision of house plants, bowls of bulbs and the hanging of reproductions of well-known pictures in the waiting rooms of the Clinic. These have considerably brightened the appearance of the waiting rooms and created much interest amongst the patients. We are indebted to the Chest Physicians for their knowledgeable advice on the choice of plants and for their continued interest in their growth; to the British Bed Cross Society for the supply and exchange every six months of the pictures and to the Camberwell Hospital Management Committee for providing the frames. Included in the general work the Secretary had consultation with 1,570 patients. The table below indicates the number of patients who have been assisted by the Committee during the year and the type of assistance provided: — Assistance given Number Clothing and footwear 49 Pocket money while in hospital 12 Wireless: repair and licences 5 Fares of relatives to distant sanatoria 62 Re-housing advance rent and arrears of rent 3 Household removals and help with furnishings 3 Taxi fare 7 Loan of bedside comforts 39 Loan of beds 28 Supply of bedding 22 Supply of towels 6 Loan of jig-saw puzzles and books 203 Hire purchase payments 3 Fees for correspondence courses 4 Part payment of funeral expenses 1 Purchase of second-hand sewing machine 1 Settlement of coal, electricity and gas accounts 5 In addition, 213 patients were referred to the National Assistance Board for financial or other help. The medical staff and health visitors of the Chest Clinic and the various voluntary organisations were helpful in bringing to the notice of the Committee cases which they considered needed advice or assistance. The response to the Christmas Seal Sale appeal was again most generous. The income from this sale is the " life blood " of the Committee and it is pleasing to record that Camberwell, for the fifth time in succession, exceeded the sum collected by any other Metropolitan Borough. The sum received by the Committee during 1953 was £1,238 14s. 6d. The London County Council again assisted the Committee by contributing to the Fund the sum of £10 from the proceeds of the Sunday Cinematograph Entertainments. Although the amount is less than in previous years this contribution is gratefully acknowledged. The handicraft class met regularly throughout the year on Friday afternoons. Many of the students from previous years continued their attendance and new students enrolled. There was a roll of 20 with an average attendance of 15. Some patients left the class having become fit for work. This loss, of course, is very satisfactory. Others married, left the Borough or undertook full-time training under the Government training scheme which prevented their further attendance. The more general handicrafts, such as dressmaking, embroidery, cane work, silk lamp shade making, leather work and glove making were continued. A desire was expressed to learn weaving and the necessary apparatus and material were purchased. Fancy cane work was most popular, particularly plant pot holders and hanging baskets to display plants. There has been a ready market for all the goods made. The Committee were able to arrange the usual summer and winter social events for the students. An outing for a day at Brighton in July and a party just prior to Christmas were organised. On both occasions the students expressed their appreciation. In our last Report we were able to record the many successes in leather work of one of our founder students. It is with some regret that we lose his attendance, having moved to the coast. He has attended the class since its formation on 4th November, 1932, and has been an inspiration to other leather workers. The following voluntary associations in the Borough have maintained close co-operation as in the past: The British Bed Cross Society; Family Welfare Association; Nursing Associations, Invalid Childrens' Aid Association; Soldiers, Sailors and Air Force Families' Association; and the Women's Voluntary Services. Their assistance is much appreciated. The official bodies have also continued to give their advice and help and for this we thank them. To those of our friends, who know the need, and have given assistance in the form of clothing, books, games and jig-saw puzzles, we are indebted. We desire to place on record our thanks to the Honorary Officers : the Worshipful the Mayor of Camberwell, Councillor Miss Rosina Whyatt as Patron to the Christmas Seal Sale; Mrs. Cecilia Greenwell, as Organiser of the Christmas Seal Sale; Mr. H. Smith, Borough Treasurer, as Treasurer ; and Mr. A. W. J. Lamb, as Auditor ; and to the Borough Council for affording us accommodation for our meetings. We also wish to thank Dr. H. W. Barnes, Medical Officer of Health, for including the Committee's Annual Report for 1952, in his Annual Report for the same year. J. M. LEONARD, Secretary. A. F. CROSSMAN, Chairman. FOOD AND DRUGS ADULTERATION. The Council's Sampling Officer obtained 350 formal and 503 informal samples during the year for submission to the Public Analyst under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. The following table summarises the results of the examinations made by the Public Analyst:— Number examined. Number adulterated, etc. Percentage of adulteration. Formal. Informal. Total. Formal.

Details of the results of various tests carried out during the year on samples of special designated milk are set out in the following table: — Methylene Blue Test Phosphatase Test Turbidity Test Designation Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Unsatisfactory 131 2 131 Pasteurised - 7 - 54 54 - - Tuberculin tested pasteurised - - - - 60 Sterilised - - - Supply of Milk to Schools and Hospitals. One hundred and five samples of milk —37 from hospitals and 68 from schools in the Borough—were obtained and submitted to both the methylene blue and phosphatase tests with satisfactory results in every case. Biological Examination of Milk. Two samples of pasteurised milk and two of tuberculin tested raw milk were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service for examination during the year. In each case it was reported that animals inoculated with these milks showed no evidence of tuberculosis on post-mortem examination. Ice Cream. Sixty-nine samples of ice cream were obtained by the Sampling Officer for examination by the methylene blue test, with the following results: — Number of Samples Grade I 47 II 7 III 3 IV 11 N.B. One sample was not suitable for the methylene blue test owing to its colour, but was found to be free from B. Coli. In addition to the above, 32 samples of ice cream were submitted for chemical analysis; three of these were found not to comply with the prescribed standard and further action was taken. One sample of water ice was submitted to the methylene blue test and found to be Grade 1. Eight ice lollies and two ice cream lollies were submitted for examination. Owing to their colour, it was not possible to carry out the methylene blue test, but, with one exception, all were found to be free from Bacillus Coli. The exception was an ice cream lolly in which faecal coli was present. The manufacturer was visited and the remainder of his stock destroyed. Bacteriological Examination of Food. The following table gives details of various foods which were submitted for routine examinations during the year:— Food No. of Samples Evaporated milk 5 Pork kidneys in piquant sauce 1 Canned peeled tomatoes 1 Synthetic cream 5 Damson jam 1 Cream (single) 3 Cream (double) 5 Cream (sterilised) 2 Ham and eggs—prepacked (frozen) 3 Milk (whole) powder 1 Cocoa, milk and sugar powder 1 Dessicated coconut 1 Sugared coconut 1 Preserved pork sausages 1 Cane sugar (Demerara) 2 The results of these examinations produced no evidence that the commodities were unfit for human consumption. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES. Registration of Food Premises. The following table indicates the number of premises in Camberwell at the end of the year which were registered with the local authority as required by Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and also the number of dairies and milkshops registered under the provisions of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949:- Sale, manufacture or storage of ice cream 438 Preparation or manufacture of: — Potted, pressed, pickled or preserved meat 220 Potted, pickled or preserved fish 70 Potted, pickled or preserved other foods 20 Dairies and Milkshops 217 Supervision of Food Premises. The district sanitary inspectors are responsible for the supervision and periodical inspection of all premises where food is manufactured, processed, stored or sold. The numbers of visits made to each type of premises during 1953 are set out in the following table : — Type of Premises No. of Inspections Bakehouses 64 Bakers and Confectioners 72 Butchers 112 Cooked and Preserved Meat Shops 22 Dairies and Milkshops 68 Fishmongers and Shell Fish Vendors 15 Fish Fryers 75 Fish Curers 115 Food Factories 31 Ice Cream Vendors 330 Public Houses 38 Restaurants and Eating Houses 373 Slaughterhouses 6 Street Markets 944 Street Traders Food Stores 4 Other Food Premises 1,316 Total 3,585 Clean Food. In September, 1953, the Ministry of Food issued a Circular (MF 16/53) drawing attention to a booklet which had been prepared entitled " Clean Catering," in which advice was given on the importance of maintaining, and on practical ways of securing, the highest possible standards of hygiene in catering establishments. This booklet was published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office at 2s. 6d. per copy. On the instructions of the Public Health Committee, a copy for each Sanitary Inspector was obtained in order that they should be conversant with its contents and bring it to the notice of the managements of all catering establishments in their respective districts. The following month the Ministry of Health issued a Circular relating to the Clean Food Campaign and enclosing a copy of a new coloured wall sheet showing some of the ways in which food can become contaminated through faulty " handhygiene "; by uncovered cuts and sores or dirty bandages, by germs conveyed from nose or mouth, by hands contaminated after using the W.C. Local authorities were invited to order, free of charge, as many copies as they could profitably use and, with the approval of the Public Health Committee, 500 of these wallsheets were obtained and distributed to all food premises in the Borough, with a covering letter inviting the proprietors to co-operate by displaying them in a prominent position at their premises for the information of all persons engaged in the handling of food. Hygiene in Hospital Catering Establishments. In addition to lecturing on hygiene to the catering staffs at Hulwich, St. Francis' and St. Giles' Hospitals, the Medical Officer of Health, at the invitation of the Camberwell Hospitals Management Committee, undertook an inspection of the catering departments at each of these hospitals and forwarded to the Group Secretary reports on his findings and recommendations for improving the standard of hygiene and cleanliness in order to reduce to a minimum the danger of an outbreak of food poisoning among the patients and/or staff. Similar action was taken in respect of the Babies Hospital, Sydenham Hill, at the request of the Bromley Group Hospital Management Committee. Both Committees expressed their thanks and appreciation for the co-operation and assistance given in this matter. Unsound Food. Any food which is suspected to be unsound is examined by the Council's Pood Inspector. If it is considered to be unfit for human consumption it is surrendered for destruction and a condemnation certificate is issued. The number of such certificates issued during 1953 was 2,646 and the following table gives particulars of the foods concerned which were destroyed by burning in the Council's incinerator:— Weight Total Weight Description Tons cwt. qrs. lbs.

The following is a summary of the work of the Pood Inspector during the year under review:— Complaints received 40 Complaints found to be justified 19 Visits:— Bakehouses 7 Butchers 41 Fish curers 102 Fish fryers 34 Ice cream premises 114 Restaurants and eating houses 149 Slaughterhouses 6 Street markets 933 Food control 281 Other food premises 937 Merchandise Marks Act 5 Inspections not defined 207 Re-inspections 9 Slaughterhouses:— 9 Carcases inspected 7 Carcases condemned Nil. Organs inspected 37 Organs condemned Nil. Food surrendered 445 Foodstuffs certified for export 2 Food condemnation certificates issued 2,646 Slaughterhouses. Only one of the three licensed slaughterhouses in the Borough was used during the year, and details of the animals slaughtered are given in the following table which is set out in the form required by Ministry of Health Circular 42/51 :— Carcases Inspected and Condemned. Cattle, excluding Cows. Cows. Calves. Sheep and Lambs. Pigs. Number killed Nil Nil Nil Nil 7 Number inspected - - - - 7 All diseases except Tuberculosis. Whole carcases condemned - - - - Nil.

The Orders in Council, made under the provisions of the above Act, require that all imported food sold or exposed for sale shall bear an indication of the country of origin. No infringements of these Orders came to the notice of the Public Health Department during the year. By-laws for the Protection of Foods. No infringements were reported of these By-Laws which are designed to secure the observance of sanitary and cleanly conditions and practices in connection with the handling, wrapping and delivery of food sold or intended for sale for human consumption, and in connection with the sale or exposure for sale in the open air of food intended for human consumption. Underground Bakehouses. At the end of the year there were 11 underground bakehouses in the Borough for which Certificates of Siutability were still valid under the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, but five of them had ceased to be used for baking purposes. The quinquennial review of underground bakehouses is due to take place in 1954. Restaurants and Eating Houses. There were 339 eating houses on the register at the end of the year, which is 20 less than the previous year, but still 138 higher than before World War 11. It would appear, however, that the public faculties for communal feeding in the area have reached saturation point, and there is little likelihood of any substantial increase in the present number of such establishments. The district sanitary inspectors kept these restaurants, cafes, etc., under supervision and where necessary action was taken to ensure compliance with the statutory requirements for the conduct of businesses of this nature. Street Traders. Street traders licences issued by the Council in respect of the sale of foodstuffs from barrows and stalls numbered 80 during the year.
