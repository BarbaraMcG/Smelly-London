Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, As this report is being prepared the Council of the new Borough of Hillingdon has been elected and as Hayes and Parlington prepares to enter a new phase in company with its neighbours Ruislip Northwood, Uxbridge and Yiewsley & Best Drayton, I thought it would be interesting to look back at the reports of previous Medical Officers of Health. The first is 1905 when Hayes was split off from Uxbridge and became a separate entity. There was a population of 3,000, a crude birth rate of 32.6, and a crude death rate of 12.6. 80% of the dwellings had a mains water supply but there was no main drainage. The Medical Officer commented that the demand for cottage accommodation was much greater than the supply- a familiar cry which has been repeated through the years. In 1910 many cottages were closed because they were insanitary and the Council erected 38 dwellings, but 9 years later a scheme for the erection of 2,078 houses was started. By now there were 1,086 occupied houses in the district and an estimated population of 5,750. The first maternity and infant welfare centre had been opened, there was a district nurse and a lady health visitor, but the infant mortality rate was 111. 1/1,000 births. In 1921 there is a record of 3 houses being built by private enterprise. In 1922 the Medical Officer was deploring the number of deaths from cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis. He also made a plea for routine vaccination against smallpox, commenting or the rush for vaccination when an outbreak occurred in London that year- people who had refused it earlier were fighting to get into the centres, when supplies of lymph were running low. He would have felt quite at home 40 years later when history repeated itself! Improved amenities in 1922 included an incinerator for disposing of the district's refuse (he viewed tippins ivith horror) and the provision of an operating theatre at Payes Cottage Hospital which had 6 beds. 4 In 1924 the present Town Hall and park had been acquired and were brought Into use and now the Registrar General was providing the estimated population figure of 8,238. The Medical Officer complained about the cottages at Hayes Gate where for lack of facilities the pail closets were emptied outside the doors and the water seeped back into the surface wells which were the only available water supply. In 1930 Hayes was united with Harlingtor. and Cranford, and tad a population of 17,950, 5,702 houses and an infant mortality rate of 64.51. Once again the deficiency of houses is commented upon and the number of applicants on the housing list is given as 2,066. By now however, there were only 7 houses without water closets or other adequate sanitary accommodation. Two years later the horse-drawn refuse wagons were replaced by motors. In 1934 the boundaries were altered again and that Part of Cranford east of the River Crane was transferred to Heston and Isleworth reducing the area of the district from 5,513 to 5,161 acres. Diphtheria immunisation was started late in 1935 and its success was apparent by 1937 when diphtheria notifications dropped by 80% compared with the previous year's figures. Also in 1937 the first old people's bungalows were built, with a rent of 5s. Od. per week inclusive of rates. Prom 1939-1945 abridged reports consisting only of statistics were published owing to the war, and there was continual movement of the staff into H.M. Forces. There was a rise in the notifications of tuberculosis and overcrowding in the district was commented upon. By 1946 the working population was 64,650 the infant mortality rate was 24.46, the birth rate war, rising and the death rate falling. In July, 1948 the National Health Service Act came into operation. The two cottage hospitals, previously subsidised by a penny rate were transferred to the regional hospital board, responsibility for diphtheria immunisation and the ambulance service went to the County Council, and the issue of free insulin, started in 1943, lapsed. Since then the emphasis of the work has been on environmental matters. High standards of food hygiene in shops etc. were obtained on a voluntary basis before legislation requiring these was introduced in 1955, the 10 year Clean Air programme mentioned elsewhere in the report was drawn up and is now nearly completed and work is in progress to Persuade owners of houses lacking the standard amenities of bath, wash hand basin, indoor water closet, hot water supply 5 and food store to take advantage of the grants available for the provision of these. The proposed amalgamation of the district with its neighbours to form the new Borough of Hillingdon has brought a considerable amount of work. Many discussions have been held with our colleagues in order to standardise the methods of work and make the eventual fusion as smooth as possible. It has been both interesting and instructive to exchange ideas and I feel that the time taken was well spent. The statistics for 1963 follow a similar pattern to those of previous years. Owing to the introduction of re-rating the rateable value of the district has taken a sharp rise, but this has not meant that more money was available for spending. The birth rate has increased and I am pleased to be able to report a decrease in the perinatal and infant mortality rates, although the latter is still well above the lowest for the district 14.0 recorded in 1957. There were outbreaks of infectious vomiting in 2 schools in the district during the early summer. These came to our notice through the head teachers concerned. Vigorous attention was paid to personal hygiene and the opportunity was taken to ensure that adequate facilities for hand washing were available in all the schools in the district. The facilities preferred are liquid soap and paper towels, as they are economical and each user has a clean towel and does not risk picking up germs from the previous user's hands. I was pleased to have quoted back to me by the mothers the lessons on personal hygiene which we had given to the children- it is not often that health education shows such rapid results. I should like to thank the staff of the Public Health Department for their enthusiastic work during the year and the staff of the Council's printing section for their work on this report, and I should like to conclude by thanking the members of the Council and especially of the Health and Safety Committee for their interest and support, not forgetting their sense of humour during meetings. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, V. SHAW Medical Officer of Health. 6 STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5,15S Population (census 1961) 67,912 Population (mid-year 1963) Registrar General's estimate of civilian population 68,630 Number of inhabited houses as at 31st December, 1963 20,826 Rateable value (estimated) as at 31st.

The notifications of infectious disease were greater than in the past few years; in addition to the expected measles epidemic (1,152 cases), there were 48 cases of scarlet fever and 60 of whooping cough. Those of scarlet fever were all mild and treated at home, but 7 patients with measles were admitted to hospital, 5 of them on account of complications; all 7 were under the age of 6 years and 4 of them were under 3 years. 9 patients with whooping cough were treated in hospital and of these 6 were under the age of 6 months. Immunisation against whooping cough is usually started at about 4 months, and it is evident from these figures that this is not too early. Mumps and German measles are not routinely notifiable, but it is interesting to note that out of 6 cases of encephalitis admitted to hospital. 5 were due to mumps and 1 to German measles. Vaccination and Immunisation The figures for immunisation and vaccination which appear on pages 13 and 14 were very kindly supplied by the Area Medical Officer. A new introduction is the use of quadruple vaccine containing diphtheria/whooping cough/tetanus and poliomyelitis antigens. It does not mean that the child receives fewer injections, as poliomyelitis vaccine can be given by mouth, but the mother need make three less trips to surgery or clinic thus saving time and effort. 12 VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION Smallpox Vaccination Poliomyelitis Vaccination Primary Re-Vaccination Primary Re-Vaccination 1959 865 177 8,050 11,403 1960 737 241 4,915 6,165 1961 959 245 4,504 5,795 1962 8,348 11,360 1,506 3,356 1963 513 139 1,141 1,957 13 14 VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION, 1963 Born in Years NUMBER OP CHILDREN IMMUNISED Diphtheria only Whooping cough only Tetanus only Diphtheria Whooping cough combined Diphtheria Tetanus combined Triple Quadrilin First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster 1962-1963 1 - - 2 4 1 2 1 21 27 962 110 100 - 1959-1961 - 4 - - 3 - - 1 12 185 58 144 3 - 1949-1958 - 51 - - 286 17 1 12 43 574 9 155 1 - TOTAL 1 55 - 2 293 18 3 14 76 786 1029 409 104 - B.C.G.

These are administered by the Middlesex County Council and there are numerous sessions for ante-natal and post natal care, child welfare, immunisation and school health services in clinic buildings, church halls, schools, and the mobile clinic. Medical Examination of Council employees. The total number of examinations carried out during 1963 was 140. Of these 37 were for superannuation purposes alone, 18 for admission to the Council's sick pay scheme, 57 for sick pay and superannuation and 28 for various special purposes. Water Supply. The water supply in the district comes from Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company and the South West Suburban District Hater Company. It is adequate in quality and Quantity and samples tested during the year have reached a satisfactory standard. The water is hard and has no plumbo-solvent action, its natural fluoride content is less than l part per million of water but it is anticipated that action to remedy this will be taken by the local health authority (the County Council). All dwellings in the district now receive a direct mains water supply, but there are approximately 130 caravans and these draw their water from standpipes on various sites. Samples taken from these pipes have proved satisfactory. Establishments for Massage or Special Treatment. There are now 7 establishments registered under the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. Six of these pre for chiropody and one for physiotherapy and all are of a satisfactory standard. 18 REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR I have pleasure in presenting my fourteenth Annual Report Only one staff vacancy occurred on the inspectorial side and this was quickly filled but the departure of Mrs. Haynes and Mrs. Pool, members of the clerical staff for 6 and 8 years respectively, caused difficulties from which the Department has not yet fully recovered. The Public Health Inspectors at present employed by the Council are the best qualified and most widely experienced staff the Department has had for many years. As the other qualityenthusiasm- which has an incalculable influence on the standard of an inspector's work, was not lacking, the years work can be looked back on with satisfaction. The Council responded to the need to improve old dwellings by approving an all-out effort to persuade owners to carry out improvements particularly the provision of bathrooms, wash hare basins, hot water supplies, internal water closets and proper food stores. The results of a survey of the older type houses in the District are given elsewhere in this report. The passing of the rousing Bill, which contains powers to declare Improvement Areas and enforce the provision of standard amenities on a systematic basis, is eagerly awaited. Once again a great deal of attention has been paid to health education, mainly in its simplest and most elementary form i.e. explaining why hands should be washed after using the toilet or before handling food, why milk is pasteurised, why refrigeration helps to keep food in good condition and so on. This kind of effort in schools is doubly rewarding as the children pass on the message at home. An example of this occurred when an outbreak of vomiting occurred in some of our schools. Unusually stringent precautions to prevent the infection spreading were put into operation. That the outbreak Petered out may have been purely coincidental but what is certain is that the lesson to wash hands was carried into hundreds of homes in the District. We have heard of many Parents who received gentle reminders, in the endearing way which children have when given an opportunity of correcting their elders, when they failed to wash their hands at the appropriate times. 19 An old-standing problem took a turn for the better during the year. The case concerns an aged and eccentric man of professional background who for many years has lived alone, apart from the company of a large number of cats, under very unsatisfactory conditions. All attempts to persuade him to clean the place or even accept help which was available from official and voluntary services failed. During the year, for the second time, it was necessary to obtain a Magistrates warrant to obtain access to the premises for inspection. This time however the old gentleman remained unimpressed when presented with the official document and actual physical force would have been necessary to execute the warrant. Wisely drawing the line at this, the Public Health Inspector who had the unpleasant task of dealing with this situation, made a graceful withdrawal. A few days later, we learned with some surprise that he had agreed to have a Home Help in two or three times a week. I am glad to report that this help is still continuing with the result that no further action has been necessary by the Public Health Department. My report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors is set out under the following headings:- I. Sanitary Administration, viz:- inspection of the district, summary of complaints, notices served, legal proceedings, offensive trades, drainage and sewerage, keeping of animals, rodent control, destruction of vermin and insect pests, disinfection, ponds, ditches and watercourses.

Visits to dwelling houses re disrepair, nuisances, etc. Visits to dwelling houses re overcrowding, multiple 1, 120 occupation and rehousing enquiries 330 Visits re improvement grants 303 Visits re certificates of disrepair 59 Visits re defective dustbins 42 Visits re defective drainage 1,219 Visits re disinfection and disinfestation 169 Visits re accumulations of refuse and refuse tips 204 Observations re smoke, noise and smell nuisances, etc. 750 Visits re smoke control areas 4,242* Inspections of public conveniences 43 Inspections of piggeries, stables, etc. 31 Inspections of moveable dwellings and caravan sites 54 visits re infectious diseases and food poisoning 986 Visits re Shops Act 1,019 Visits re inspection of food 252 Inspections of dairies and milk shops 81 Inspections of ice cream manufacturers premises 15 Inspections of ice cream dealers premises and vehicles 205 Inspections of food shops, cafes, etc. 2,039 Inspections of clubs, licensed premises, etc. 78 Inspections of hawkers' vehicles and store-places and mobile canteens Inspections of factories, workplaces and outworkers 123 premises 403 Inspections re rodent control 1,004 Inspections re music and dancing licences 28 Visits re sampling of milk, water, ice cream and other foods 276 Interviews with builders, owners, etc. 522 Inspections of petroleum stores 271 Inspections of ditches, watercourses, etc. 30 Inspections of schools 44 Inspections of swimming pools Miscellaneous visits 13 1,409# Total 17,364 In addition 1,501 visits were made to premises where access was not obtained. * These figures include visits made by the Ceneral Assistant for Smoke Control Areas. # Miscellaneous visits include visits re Pet Animals Act, Fireguards regulations, Pag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, Scrap Metal Dealers, etc. 22 The number of visits made by the Inspectors is slightly less than last year, but as I have pointed out on previous occasions this, in itself, is of little significance. In 1962: there was a heavy back-log of routine inspections to make up, but last year, with these arrears cleared off, more time could be spent on each visit. One figure which increased significantly was the number of visits to dwelling houses re disrepair, nuisances, etc. This however cannot be due to a deterioration in the general standard of repair of dwelling houses. It is my opinion, and also that of the district public health inspectors, that house property in this district is in better repair at the present time than it has been for a long time. A more probable explanation is that the occupiers of rented houses are no longer willing to accept without complaint defects which a few years ago would have been considered commonplace. If this tendency of the general public to become more fastidious is in fact a correct explanation, it is a very welcome sign and worthy of encouragement not only in the field of housing but in every other aspect of public health endeavour. Complaints. The number of complaints received is substantially more than last year with significant increases in the figures for blocked drains, housing disrepair, offensive accumulations and food. Here again, l am convinced that the most likely explanation, in most of these cases, is the increasingly high standard demanded by the public in all matters affecting their environment. One would like to think that the considerable amount of attention paid by the Public Health Inspectors to the more simple and homely aspects of health education in recent years has been a contributory factor. 23 Choked and defective drains 473 Insanitary or dilapidated condition of premises 129 Offensive accumulations or deposits 38 Defective dustbins 21 Vermin or insects 41 Gypsies 3 Rat and mouse infestations 277 Unsound or contaminated food 45 Nuisances from animals 1 Overcrowding 10 Dust, smoke and noise nuisances 39 Other Nuisances 78 Total 1,155 Notices Served. Informal Notices served 268 Statutory Notices served: - Public Health Act, 1936, Section 39 4 Public Health Act, 1936, Section 45 1 Public Health Act, 1936, Section 75 2 Public Health Act, 1S36, Section 78 1 Public Health Act, 1936, Section 83 1 Public Health Act, 1936, Section 93 10 Public Health Act, 1936, Section 277 1 Public Health Act, 1961, Section 17 26 Housing Act, 1957, Section 85 1 Housing Act, 1957, Section 170 4 Housing Act, 1961, Section 15 7 Clean Air Act, 1956, Section 12 206 Legal Proceedings. Food and Drugs Act, 1955. (a) A baker was fined £20 and ordered to pay £6 costs in respect of the sale of a loaf of bread containing pieces of glass. (b) A baker was fined £10 with £6. 6s. 0d. costs for selling through his roundsman beef sausages which were mouldy. (c) A greengrocer was fined £5 with £2 costs for smoking whilst handling food. 24 (d) A baker was fined £50 with £5, 5s. Od. costs for selling a cake containing a piece of wire. (The firm concerned had a number of previous convictions). (e) A national dairy was fined £15 with £10. 10s. Od. costs for selling a bottle of milk containing a mould growth. (f) A charge against a local grocer of selling a mouldy meat pie was dismissed by the Magistrates - no costs were awarded to either party. Middlesex County Council Act, 1961, Section 47. A car breaker was fined £5 with £1. 1s. Od. costs for emitting dark smoke from industrial premises other than from a chimney, i.e. by burning a motor van. Offensive Trades. There are two establishments in the district at which the trade of rag sorting is carried on. In both cases the premises are satisfactory and proper supervision over the disposal of the rags is exercised. Drainage and Sewerage, The table below includes all premises in the District which are not on main drainage. There are now only three premises within a reasonable distance of a sewer which still retain cesspools or pail closets and there is a good prospect of these being dealt with in the near future. The practice of clearing stopped drains free of charge where this can be achieved simply by rodding or plunging was continued. Cesspool drainage Pail closets A. Premises within 100 ft. of an existing accessible sewer 2 1 B. Premises within 100 ft. of a possible sewer extension - - C. Premises where no sewer is likely to become available 14 5 D. Premises likely to be demolished soon 3 - Totals 19 6 25 Four small private sewage disposal plants are in use. A 50% grant is available for the conversion of pail closets to water closets and for the abolition of cesspools. Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. Keeping of Animals. Byelaws under section 81 of the Public Health Act to control the keeping of pigs, horses and cattle are in force. They deal with structural condition and cleanliness of premises in which these animals are kept, boiling of swill, drainage, the storage of manure, etc. Rodent Control. Infestation in the District is at a very low level and one assistant, with many duties in addition to rodent control is well able to cope with all the treatment necessary. At dwellings this is free but a charge is Fade for work carried out at business premises. The statistical report on rodent control is set out in Appendix II. Destruction of Vermin and Insect Pests, During the year the following treatments were carried out: - Beetles 1 Ants 9 Fleas 6 Bugs 7 Wasps 7 Disinfection. In accordance with current practice terminal disinfection of premises or personal property is no longer carried out except in the case of the more serious infectious diseases. All library books, however, which have been in infected premises are disinfected before they are returned to the library. 26 Facilities for the steam disinfection of bedding are available when required at Ft. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, but it has not been necessary to use these facilities during the year. Ponds, ditches, Watercourses, etc. The routine inspection of these sites for rodent infestation, pollution, general nuisances and mosquitoes was carried out and remedial action taken where necessary. The canal feeder, which runs across the northern part of the District was again the subject of complaint. Although the responsible authority always takes palliative action when the matter is referred to them it will undoubtedly remain a source of trouble until it is filled in. 27 PART II - AIR POLLUTION (a) Smoke Control Areas. The ten-year programme to bring the whole of the Urban District under Smoke Control continued according to schedule and by the end of the year the following progress had been made:- No. of Smoke Control Orders Acres No. of Dwellings Involved Other Buildings Involved Local Authority Private In operation 21 4,065 2, 118 10,512 738 Confirmed but not yet in operation 1 76 294 576 22 Submitted for confirmation 1 180 496 785 119 Preparatory work in progress 1 202 146 1,007 35 Totals 24 4,523 3,054 12,880 914 These areas account for 88% of the area of the district and 76% of the dwellings of the district. Just before the end of the year the Government White Paper on Domestic Fuel Supplies and the Clean Air Policy and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular 69/63 on the same subjects were issued. The former made it clear that due to important technological changes in the gas industry the expected increase in production of gas coke would not take place and future Smoke Control Areas must rely on other fuels such as hard coke, gas, off-peak electricity and oil. The latter document made provision for revised grant arrangements, enabling Local Authorities to allow expenditure on approved types of gas, oil and electric heaters and also on closed or openable stoves and under-floor draught grates for grant purposes. These appliances each offer at least one of the following advantages to off-set against their higher cost i.e. lower emission of sulphur, cheaper heat, greater comfort in the home, additional convenience, labour saving operation, elimination of delivery and storage difficulties. 28 No exemptions to Smoke Control Orders have been granted except in the case of premises likely to be demolished in the near future. Exemptions permitting the use of sticks and paper for kindling have not been necessary as gas is readily available throughout the district and where a householder rooted objection to the use of gas, electricity is invariably available as an alternative. (b) Height of Chimneys. Under Section 10 of the Clean Air Act, 1956 plans of new industrial buildings deposited for byelaw approval must be rejected if the height of any chimney shown on the plan is insufficient to prevent smoke, grit, dust or gases from becoming prejudicial to health or a nuisance. This is the only provision in the Clean Air Act for reducing the harmful effects of gases, e.g. sulphur dioxide, emitted from chimneys, but the section is so full of loopholes that its full potential is not being realised. Efforts are being made by the Council and the West Middlesex Clean Air Co-ordinating Committee acting through the Association of Municipal Corporations to obtain amending legislation so that these powers can make their maximum con tribution to clean air. Plans submitted for byelaw approval are passed to me by the Engineer and Surveyor for a decision on this particular point. During the year seven plans were examined for this purpose and in six instances it was necessary to ask for a taller chimney than was shown on the plan. (c) New Furnaces. Eleven notifications under Section 3(3) of the Clean Air Act were received regarding the installation of new furnaces; nine were oil-fired, one gas-fired and one fired by solid fuel. No applications for prior approval under Section 3(2) of the Act were received. (d) The Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958. These regulations lay down the maximum period for which lark and black smoke may be emitted from industrial furnaces. 29 Industrial boiler plant in the District is now operated at a very high degree of efficiency and most installations are, for all practical purposes, entirely smokeless in operation. no contraventions ware observed during the year. (e) Grit and Dust. One complaint of dust emission carried over from the previous year was remedied and no further cases have occurred. (f) New Building Byelaws re. Heating and Cooking Appliances. A new building byelaw, made under Section 24 of the Clear Air Act, has been in force in this district from 1st September, 1957. It requires that new dwellings should be provided with heating and cooking appliances which are suitably designed for burning gas, electricity, oil or solid smokeless fuels. (g) Pollution from Flood Vehicles. Although the Council has no statutory powers to deal with the emission of smoke or fumes from road vehicles any cases which are observed are drawn to the attention of the owners of the vehicles and in most cases a co-operative attitude is met with. Two letters were written to the owners of offending vehicles and in both cases an apology was received together with an undertaking that immediate steps would be taken to prevent a recurrence. (h) Pollution from Railway. The main line of the Western Region of British Railways which runs through the industrial part of the district is now largely dieselised. (i) Industrial Bonfires. Section 47 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1961, which closes one of the gaps in the Clean Air Act by prohibiting dark smoke from industrial bonfires, is in operation, and is proving a most valuable additional aid in the clean air campaign. 30 Successful proceedings under the Section were taken against a car breaker who, after stripping everything of value from a vehicle would set fire to it and cause dense black smoke. (j) Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution. Three stations for the measurement of atmospheric pollution by the daily volumetric method are in use. The pollutants measured are smoke and sulphur dioxide, Contrary to the national trend, sulphur pollution in the District has for several years been falling slightly. Last year however, this position was not wholly maintained; in some months the figures at some of the measuring stations were higher than in previous years. A change in the technique of measuring smoke pollution (the use, during the winter months of a 2 in. clamp instead of a 1 in.) carried out at the suggestion of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research made comparison with previous years difficult and it is probably advisable to defer comment until next year. 31 Monthly Averages for Sulpher Dioxide, 1963 (Microgr ammes per cubic metre) William Byrd School, Bath Road Coldharbour Lane Grange Park School, Lansbury Drive January 189 236 317 February 191 251 321 March 115 176 167 April 81 100 118 May 38 67 59 June 43 52 49 July 56 87 66 August 41 65 50 September 90 119 105 October 96 122 109 November 143 166 175 December 202 210 219 Monthly Averages for Smoke, 1963 (Microgrammes per cubic metre) William Byrd School, Bath Road Coldharbour Lane Grange Park School, Lansbury Drive January 165 159 115 February 125 166 100 March 71 97 52 April 51 61 51 May 30 28 16 June 24 24 15 July 30 29 20 August 34 27 20 September 55 53 46 October 56 56 52 November 99 100 74 December 186 145 121 32 (k) Publicity. More than 10,000 leaflets were distributed in proposed and actual Smoke Control Areas. These leaflets are supplied free of charge by the Ministry, the Coal Utilisation Council, Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, the North Thames Gas Board and the Southern Electricity Board. (1) Vest Middlesex Clean Air Co-ordinating Committee, Three meetings were held during the year anc! the range of. topics discussed included:- the performance of pumps used in measuring pollution, the price of solid smokeless fuels in paper bags, emergency supplies for old people, moisture in fuel, domestic oil-fired central heating boilers, notification of new furnaces, coke supplies, contraventions in Smoke Control Areas, future trends in Smoke Control, grants for adaptations, contractors inability to cope with adaptations in Smoke Control Areas, chimney heights. The Committee's representatives met officials of the North Thames Gas Board to discuss the Board's serious arrears of work in adapting fireplaces in Smoke Control Areas. The outcome was most satisfactory; all arrears were cleared off within a month and the Board agreed to take steps to try to prevent a similar situation recurring. Recommendations made by the Committee for strengthening Section 10 of the Clean Air Act (dealing with the height of chimneys) are being considered by the Association of Municipal Corporations with a view to the introduction of amending legislation. The following authorities with a population of 654,990 and an area of 40,050 acres are represented on the Committee: - Acton Borough Council Brentford & Chiswick Borough Council Ealing Borough Council Feltham Urban District Council Hayes & Harlington Urban District Council heston & Isleworth Borough Council Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council Southall Borough Council 33 PART III - FOOD Milk Supply. A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy farms and farmers) is maintained and the numbers shown on the Register are:- Milk Distributors 30 Dairies 2 No action could be taken in respect of a complaint about a bottle of milk containing cement owing to the necessity of taking proceedings in the area where the milk was bottled. In this case the milk might have been bottled at either of two dairies from which the firm concerned supply milk into this District. The Council had no means of determining at which dairy the milk was actually bottled and could not therefore take proceedings. An unusual complaint about foreign matter in homogenised milk has been received. The foreign matter consisted of greyish brown deposit, in globular formation, which was readily dispersed when the milk was slightly agitated, but settled out again later. Two pint bottles were sent to the Public Analyst and his report states that the foreign matter consisted of pollen grains and vegetable debris, adding that although harmless the foreign matter should not have been present. This complaint is the first of its kind which has ever been received in the Department and consequently I have made wide enquiries about it. It is a condition known as sedimentation and occurs only with homogenised milk. Any treatment other than homogenisation would leave the foreign matter widely dispersed in suspension or enmeshed in the cream; in either case it could not be seen. The process of homogenisation however results in its forming a smudgy dirty deposit at the bottom of the bottle which is repellent to consumers. There is no question of the homogenisation process adding anything to the milk which was not already there. When it first occurred, sedimentation was recognised by the dairy industry as one of the serious and more troublesome defects of homogenised milk; it was however overcome by the use of the process known as clarification which is now common practise in all large dairies, some using this process only in conjunction with homogenisation and others using it for all heat treated milk. The dairy concerned in this case is not a national concern but operates mainly in West Middlesex and 34 shire, their plant being at Eracknell. In reply to my request for their observations on the complaint the firm stated that the deposited matter was naturally present in the milk, but the Public Analyst's Certificate does not support this. Literature on the subject also confirms that attention to securing a clean milk supply in the first place and closer supervision of sanitation are both important points in overcoming the trouble. Throughout their correspondence with me the firm have placed great emphasis on the good state of their dairy and as it is comparatively new this can be taken for granted. It is however largely irrelevant to the present issue. As I have pointed out, this phenomenon can be minimised by strict attention to conditions on the farm, but if present when the milk is delivered to the processing plant can be eliminated by the clarifying process, amethod which is not used by this particular firm. It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies regulations, 1959, to prohibit the sale of milk. Ice Cream. Twenty premises are registered for the manufacture of ice cream but only five of these are now actually used for this purpose. A further 111 premises are registered for the sale of ice cream, in the majority of cases only wrapped ice cream is sold. The requirements of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations are complied with by all manufacturers in the district. Sixty samples of ice cream were obtained and taken to the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, for bacteriological examination. The use of the special standard devised by the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, has been continued and is, for convenience, set out as follows:- Grade Count Faecal Coli I Below 500 Nil II 500 - 10,000 Nil III 10,000-100,000 Nil IV over 100,000 or present 35 The grading of samples taken was as follows: - Grade I 17 or 28 . 33% Grade II 32 or 53.33% Grade III 7 or 11.67% Grade IV 4 or 6.67% These results, with nearly 82% of the samples falling in Grades I and II, are almost equal to the best we have ever had. The percentage of Grade IV samples was substantially less than ever before. The samples were taken mainly from those manufacturers and itinerant vendors whose products have been found to be unreliable in a bacteriological sense. All vehicles from which unwrapped ice cream is sold are equipped with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nailbrushes. The Inspection of Meat and Other Foods. By Orders (S.I, Nos. 2154 and 2155 - 1960) made by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood under the Slaughterhouse Reports (Appointed Day) Order, 1959, the Construction Regulations contained in the Slaughterhouse (Hygiene) Regulations, 1958, and the Slaughter of Animals (Prevention of Cruelty) Regulations, 1958, are in force. There are no licensed slaughterhouses in the district. A large proportion of the meat sold in the district comes from the London wholesale markets and there does not appear to be any demand from the trade for slaughtering facilities in this district. One slaughterman's licence was issued. In view of the popularity of poultry as an article of diet the availability of a refresher course on poultry inspection was opportune. It was held at Smithfield and was attended by all the Public Health Inspectors. 36 The following foods were condemned during the year: - Meat (raw) 3,455¾ lbs. Meat (tinned) 4.508¼ lbs. Fish (raw) 541 lbs. Shellfish 364 lbs. Fish (tinned) 64¾ lbs. Fruit (tinned) 2,678¼ lbs. Vegetables (tinned) 483¼ lbs. Vegetables (raw) 672 lbs. Miscellaneous Food (tinned) 94 lbs. Other Miscellaneous Food 221¾ lbs. Miscellaneous Frozen Food 1,273¼ lbs. Condemned foods are disposed of, whenever possible, to a manufacturer of animal feeding stuffs and fertilisers. Small quantities of condemned foods are buried, under supervision, on the Council's refuse tip. Food Hygiene. Emphasis has again been placed on the education of food handlers, as the general standard in this aspect of food hygiene still falls short of the structural standard of food premises. Thirteen lectures were given to a total of 572 people. No certificates of exemption from certain requirements of the Food Hygiene regulations, 1955, have been granted. Byelaws under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, have beer in force in the district since July, 1950. Hawkers of Food The registration of hawkers of all classes of foodstuffs is compulsory under the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950. The vehicles and storage premises used by these traders are regularly inspected by the Public Health Inspectors and have to comply with the Food Hygiene Regulations. Mobile shops from which groceries, meat, fish, ice cream, refreshments or any other open food are sold, are all fitted with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels, and nailbrushes. 37 Number of hawkers registered 76 Number of hawkers' storage premises registered 9 The difference between these figures is accounted for by (a) the fact that it is common for these traders to buy their produce from day to day, and (b) many hawkers having storage premises in other districts. Sampling of Food and Drugs. (a) The routine sampling of miscellaneous foods was continued during the year. The following samples were examined: - Cream Cakes etc 19 Imitation Cream 5 Pish Cakes 1 Frozen Prawns 1 Cooked tinned meats 88 144 Although there are no bacteriological standards for these foods, the reports received, apart from giving an assurance of the absence of pathogenic organisms, are a useful guide as to the standard of handling practised in the food trade. The bacteriological examination of samples of ice cream, water and some of the miscellaneous foods is carried out at the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, and I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory for their ready assistance at all times; also to the Director and Staff of the Central Public Health Laboratory, N.W.9 for their valued assistance in connection with samples of miscellaneous foods. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respective headings. (b) The sampling of food and drugs for chemical analysis is carried out by the Middlesex County Council and it is usual to give details of this work, supplied by the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department. Owing to pressure of work in connection with the new Weights and Measures Act and the transfer of functions under the London Government Act the Chief Officer says he would find it extremely difficult to produce a report in respect of the District. A full report of the work of his Department will appear in due course. 38 Food Poisoning. No outbreaks of food poisoning occurred during the year. Complaints about Food. Forty-five complaints were received, compared with twentyseven last year and twenty-two the year before, about food alleged to be contaminated, unsound or not of the nature, substance or quality demanded. Some were of a trivial nature but it was decided to take proceedings in six cases. Inspection of Food Premises.

In 1961, it was agreed that a further 48 unfit houses should be dealt with during the four years 1962 to 1965; this programme is now being carried out. Inspection of Houses during the year. 1.

(a) Number of Clearance Areas declared (b) Number of unfit dwellings included in Clearance Areas (c) Number of unfit dwellings in Clearance Areas demolished 7 41 Overcrowding. At the beginning of the year there were three known cases of overcrowding. During the year 15 new cases were discovered. In four of the new cases an offence under Section 78 of the Housing Act, 1957 was committed end the Council decided to take action against the owners concerned unless the overcrowding was abated within fourteen days. In each instance Commonwealth immigrants were involved. Legal action was not necessary as in each case abatement of the overcrowding took place within the specified time. The average number of occupants for each inhabited house in the district was 3.30 slightly less than last year, and the lowest figure since 1938. Houses in Multiple Occupation. A combination of prompt action by the Clerk and Solicitor under Planning Law and the Public Health Department under the Housing Act, 1961, has kept this symptom of the housing shortage under control. Seven new cases were reported for action and in five of these notices were served under Section 15 of the Housing Act, 1961, requiring the provision of additional amenities in accordance with the Standards adopted by the Council last year. These notices usually produce a reduction in the number of occupants of the houses or sometimes the person in control decides to sell up and leave the district, no doubt in the certain knowledge that he will find a district where life is a little easier for him and bis business can be carried on with less official interference. As Commonwealth immigrants are often involved in multiple occupation it is a considerable advantage that a member of the clerical staff of the Department can speak both of the principal languages of the Indian sub-continent. Certificates of Disrepair. The following action was taken under the Rent Act, 1957, in connection with Certificates of Disrepair:- 42 Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) 5 Landlords notified of proposals to issue a Certificate of Disrepair (Form J) 4 Undertakings given by Landlords to remedy defects (Form K) 5 Applications by landlord or tenant for Certificate as to the remedying of Defects which Landlord has undertaken to remedy (Form 0) 7 Certificates issued as to the Remedying of Defects specified in a Landlord's Undertaking to remedy Defects (Form F) 7 Improvement Grants. Consideration was given by the Council to Circular 42/62 in which the Minister of Housing and Local Government urged Local Authorities to take positive action to stimulate applications for grant. I was authorised to approach owners with a view to persuading them to apply for grants and the Council agreed that as a last resort, where owners were unwilling to carry out improvements, they would use their powers of compulsory acquisition and do the work themselves. This however has not yet been found necessary as the other steps taken have resulted in the owners showing increased interest in the scheme and by the end of the year applications had started to come in steadily. Thirty-three applications for Standard Grants were received against nine last year, and all were granted. Only three applications were received for Discretionary Grants-, all were subsequently withdrawn and re-submitted as Ptsndard Grant applications. A survey showed that there were 639 privately owned houses in the District which lacked one or more of the five standard amenities, i.e. bath, wash hand basin, internal water closet, hot water supply and proper food store. These houses showed a lack of:- 400 bathrooms, 517 wash hand basins, 517 internal water closets, 466 hot water supplies, 379 food stores. 43 Moveable Dwellings. To avoid involving both the Health and Safety Committee and the Town Planning Committee in this matter and as planning consent is an essential preliminary to a site licence, the enforcement of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, has been entrusted to the Town Planning Committee. Consultation between the Engineer and Surveyor's Department and the Public Health Department takes place on applications for Site Licences. New Houses. During the year the following dwellings were completed by the Council and Private Developers:- Council: Houses 39 Old Persons' Dwellings 8 Plats 33 Maisonettes 24 Privat e Development: Dwellings 87 Housing Association: Dwellings 44 PART V - FACTORIES, SHOPS, OFFICES, ETC. There are one hundred and seventy three factories with mechanical power and five factories without mechanical power on the Register, with a ranee of products including:- Aircraft, bread and confectionery, building materials, car accessories, carbon products, chocolate, cocoa, coffee extracts, cold stores, electrical condensors and transformers, electronic devices, fibre glass articles, furniture, lubricating oil, meat products, optical lenses, plastics, precision tools, radar, gramophone records, rubber products, tarniacadam, steel wool and wood block floors. Pull details of the inspections carried out and notices served are set out in Appendix 1 to this report. Outworkers. Part VII of the Factories Act requires the occupier of a factory who employs persons carrying out certain classes of work in tleir own homes to supply a list of such persons to the District Council every six months. There are 108 outworkers in the district and 174 inspections were made; in every instance the work was found to be carried out under suitable conditions. Shops. All parts of the Shops Act are administered, including hours of closing, assistants' half holiday, Sunday trading, comfort and welfare of assistants etc. The Act applies to 66S Premises in the district to which the Public Health Inspectors made 1,019 visits. As a result three informal notices were served, but it was not considered necessary to institute legal proceedings. For the convenience of shopkeepers a stock of the statutory forms which they are obliged to display on their premises, is beld in the Public Health Department. 45 Offices, Workplaces, etc. The Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act received the Royal Assent on the 31st July. Efforts by the Council to secure an amendment so that the Public Health Inspectors in this District could continue to inspect offices in connection with factories, which they have been doing for many years, were unsuccessful. The inspection of these premises when the Act comes into force in 1964 will therefore pass to the Factory Inspectorate. 46 PART VI - M ISCfcLLANIKOUS Petroleum (Regulation) Acts. These Acts apply not only to the storage of petrol but to petroleum mixtures, cellulose solutions, other oils and calcium carbide. During the year 107 licences were issued in respect of:- 204,050 gallons of petroleum spirit and mixtures. 29,022 gallons of cellulose solutions. During the year the Council adopted the Home Office Code of Principles of Construction for (a) storage of cans, drums and other receptacles (b) petrol filling stations (c) basement, sub-basement garages and underground car parks and also the Model Conditions of Licence for the latter group of premises. All licences now incorporate the Model Licensing Conditions suggested by the Home Office in 1957, and the latest recommendations of the Home Office for electrical equipment and installation in connection with petrol pumps have been adopted. Electrical work is checked by a suitably qualified member of the Engineer and Surveyor's staff. During the year 271 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the requirements of the Acts were complied with and six minor infringements were dealt with by warning letters. An incident occurred which illustrates the need for strict enforcement of existing Regulations and which led to the conditions of licence being strengthened. Whilst work was in progress on the construction of a pit for a new underground petrol store at a filling station a very strong smell of petrol was noticed and the Fire Prevention Officer confirmed that the atmosphere in the pit was explosive, work continued under strict supervision and as the pit got deeper petrol could be seen percolating into it from the direction of the existing tanks. Ultimately the leakages were traced and faulty lines disconnected. A fire engine was standing by for three days, considerable overtime was worked by the Council's refuse tip attendant and a bull-dozer driver ensuring the safe disposal of petrol contaminated soil, and a great deal of the Public Health Inspector's time was used. 47 An employee of the firm who had been called in to trace the leakage told the Inspector that the firm had been called to five breaks in the pump draw-off pipes in the last eighteen months. The breaks were caused by electric drills working on the forecourt. A representative of the petrol filling station stated that the pimps had not been used following the breaks until they had been repaired. This department was not informer of any of these breaks. It appears that there are strong grounds for making it obligatory upon a person holding a licence to store petrol, to give notice to the local authority of any repairs carried out so that the installation can be tested on completion of the repairs. The inclusion of a new clause in licences was approved by the Council making it obligatory on the part of the licence holders to give notice in writing if any work other than minor adjustments in the course of routine maintenance is carried out to any part of the installation or likely to affect the installation. Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act. Although upholstering is carried out at several premises in the district the Act does not apply to any of them as the type of filling generally used is outside the scope of the Act. All premises used for upholstery and similar trades are visited occasionally so that if circumstances change and the type of work to which the Act applies is undertaken, the provisions of the Act can be enforced. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. This Act makes it compulsory for new gas, electric and oil heaters to have suitable guards. Such appliances are sold at 3 1 shops in the district and all were visited by the Public lea 1th Inspectors in the enforcement of the Act. Pet Animals Act. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that pet animals are sold under conditions which do not expose them to cruelty or unnecessary discomfort. Pour premises are licensed under the Act and eight visits made by the Public Health Inspectors to secure compliance with the conditions of the Licence. 48 Agriculture (Safety, Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 195G. Sections 3(1) and 5 of this Act relating to the provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences for agricultural workers are enforced by the Public Health Inspectors and in this district, which is still partly rural, the Act serves a useful purpose. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907. Section 86 of this Act, requiring dealers in marine stores and scrap metal to be registered with the Local Authority, has been adopted by the Council. Registered premises,of which there pre six, are visited from time to time and the records which are required to be kept, inspected. Swimming Pools. There is no public swimming pool in the district. There are practice pools at two local junior schools, both have automatic dosing equipment and continuous filtration. There is a swimming pool at one of the new hotels in the district. Continuous filtration and automatic chlorination is carried out. Samples of water from all these pools were taken regularly and all were reported to be of excellent bacteriological quality, showing that the arrangements for purification of the water were working satisfactorily. Land Charges Act, 1925. During the year 1,740 applications for information from persons proposing to acquire premises in the district were dealt with. Each one required answers to questions about sanitary notices or orders (outstanding or contemplated), Smoke Control Orders, Certificates of Disrepair and Slum Clearance. Licensing Act, 1961. The above mentioned legislation amended the Conditions governing the issue of licences for the supply of intoxicating liquor to private clubs. This Council is now informed of such applications by the Clerk to the Justices, and can object to 49 the issue if the premises are not suitable and convenient, in view of their character and condition and the size and nature of the club. The Council appointed its Public Health Inspectors as "authorised officers" under the Act. Twelve applications for the issue or renewal of a licence were investigated and all the premises were found to be satisfactory. Noise Abatement. London Airport is by far the greatest source of noise in the District; aircraft however are exempt from the provisions of the Noise Abatement Act. Various bodies have made strenuous and persistent efforts to get the nuisance mitigated but with little effect. The statutory undertakings (gas, water, electricity, etc.) are also substantial, if intermittent, contributors to the general noise level with their pneumatic road drills. Five complaints of noise nuisance were received. Three referred to noises from local factories and every effort was made to minimise the nuisance. The other two referred to continued excessive noise due to starting private motor vehicles late at night and the persons concerned were persuaded to be more co-operative neighbours. 50 Appendix I Part A.
