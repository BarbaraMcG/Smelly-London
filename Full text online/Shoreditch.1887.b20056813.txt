Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1888, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was .£63,319 8s. od.; the amount in the pound levied for the four Quarters was 2s. 2d., being for the Quarter to Midsummer, yd.; to Michaelmas, /d. ; to Christmas, 6d. ; and to Lady-day, 6d. During the previous year the Poor Rate was 2s.. The amount of the Guardians' calls for the year ending Ladyday, 1S87, was £41,660; and for the last year, £48,900 ; and for the Half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1888, is £31,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1888, was £5,500. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rates will be found in the Balance Sheets, as audited and signed. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The statement hereto appended will give the details of the Receipts and Expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last year were— s. d. General—in the £ ... ... 20 Sewers ditto ... ... ... o 9 2 9 The total amount collected on the Vestry Rates for the year was £79334 8s. 4d., an increase upon the previous 'year of £985 us. 6d. 8 Of these sums collected by the Vestry as for Poor Rates large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposes over which the Vestry has no control. Thus, in addition to the £48,900 paid to the Guardians, out of which the County Rate and Metropolitan Asylum's Board's charges are paid, there is a sum of £ 12,510. 10s. 8d. paid to the Commissioners of Metropolitan Police, and £687 17s. 5d. for Registration, &c., expenses. From the Sewers Rate is paid the Metropolitan Hoard's Consolidated Rate of £17647. 18s. 4d. From the General Rate is paid the School Board Rate of £22273 is. 6d., and the Toll Bridges Precept of £2625 os. 4d. All these charges are based upon the rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses, nor for the allowance to owners. ASSESSMENT. The valuation of the Parish for Assessment purposes, for the year beginning the 5th of April, 1888, is as follows:— April, 1887. , 1888. Increase. Gross value .£790,308. £790,553. £245. Decrease. Rateable value £642,380. £642,133. £247. It will be seen that very little addition was made during the last year, and in consequence of a general fall of rents throughout the Parish the rateable value shows a decrease. The number of Assessments and the Rateable Value of each Ward, omitting such of the Gas, Water, Railway and other Assessments, as are included in several Wards, are as follows:— Number of Assessments. Rateable Value. Moorfields Ward 1,4I5 80,589 Church Ward, North 2,040 56,575 Church Ward, South I,IOQ 60,868 Hoxton Ward 2,330 71,728 Wenlock Ward 1,796 54,282 9  Number of Assessments.

The Shoreditch Workhouse arrd Infirmary is not assessed. The total of the above is £144,318, which shows that the ordinary Assessments, under £500, amount to £497,815. THE TOWN HALL During the year the Large Hall has been let 126 times ; the Council Chamber 5 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by Local Societies on several occasions. The receipts for letting Hall, Council Chamber and Committee Rooms were £66g. 14s. od. 10 VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The number of Vestry and Committee Meetings held during the year ended 1st May, 1888, 1s as follows:— . 44 Finance Committee (including Meetings of Audit Committee) 33 Sewers, &c., Committee 30 General Purposes Committee Valuation Committee, including Sub-Committee ... 6 Town Hall Committee ditto ... 20 Parliamentary and Improvement Committee ... 5 Special Committees ... ... ... 14 lotal ... ..I * 1 < .I. i6y RAILWAY AND LOCAL UNDERTAKINGS. No Bill has been introduced in the present Session of a Local character, directly affecting this Parish, except one to obtain an extension of time for the construction of the Columbia Market Railway. This Bill was unopposed, and an extension of time for three years was obtained. In respect of the powers already granted by Parliament for the following purposes : the Regent's Canal and Docks Railway, the Great Eastern Railway widening through Shoreditch, the Tramway Extension from Great Eastern Street to Whitechapel, and the widening of Plough Yard by the London and North Western Company, little progress has been made. I am not aware that any steps have been taken to acquire any property in Shoreditch for the Regent's Canal Railway, and 1 have no information as regards any progress made or contemplated with respect to the Western section—Barbican to Paddington. The Great Eastern Railway Company has been for some time past engaged in acquiring property for the widening in Bishopsgate, Norton Folgate, and Shoreditch,and active steps maybe shortly expected. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company commenced the construction of 11 the Commercial Street extension about the beginning of June and it will shortly be completed. GENERAL PARLIAMENTARY PROPOSALS. A number of Bills have been introduced—some by the Government, but mostly by private members—which, if passed, would have some bearing upon the duties and functions of the Metropolitan Local Authorities. The most important, because most likely to pass, are the Bills introduced by Mr. Ritchie, President of the Local Government Board. The first, the Local Government Electors Bill, provides for the making of an extra Register of Voters for the purpose of electing County Councillors. This Register is to include female occupiers, as well as male, where the qualification would be the same, and some minor matters. This Bill has passed, and the Act is now being put into force. The Local Government Bill as it affects the Metropolis has for its chief features, the abolition of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the transfer of the powers of that body, as well as some of the functions of the Justices of the Peace, to a new body to be called the County Council of London—London being the district now under the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works. It also proposes to transfer certain License duties to the new Councils as part of its revenue. The Vestry has petitioned for certain amend_ ments to be made in this Bill, but it has at present made such little progress through Committee, that it would be useless to hazard any opinion (even supposing the Bill should pass) as to its ultimate form. The Bills introduced by private members comprise miscellaneous subjects, such as Rating of Advertisement Hoardings, Dwelling Houses Sanitary Inspection, Early Closing, Housing of the Working Classes, London Coal and Wine Duties continuance, School Board for London Elections, School Board Officers' Pensions, Metropolis Local Government, Metropolitan Fire Brigade Expenses, Parliamentary and Municipal Registration of Voters, Parliamentary Election Expenses—charge to Ratepayers, Poor Rates Equalisation, Vestrymen's Qualifications, &c. The 12 mentary Committee has passed most of these Bills under review. Some they have petitioned against, others in favour with amendments, and in respect to others have recorded their observations and objections. As there does not seem to be the slightest probability of any one of these Bills passing this Session, it is unnecessary to enter into further details as to their contents. APPOLD STREET IMPROVEMENT. The accounts between the Vestry and the Metropolitan Board, in respect to this Improvement, were stated in the last year's report to have been closed except as to outstanding loans. The nett cost to the Vestry, exclusive of interest on loans, was £42,986 9s, 9d. The amount of loan outstanding at Lady-day last on this account was £33,602. PROJECTED BATHS AND WASHHOUSES. In March, 1887, the Vestry appointed a Special Committee to consider and report upon the expediency of establishing Baths and Washhouses in this Parish. The committee made extensive enquiries and visited several of the best and most recent establishments. They also inspected two available sites within the the Parish and ultimately reported to the Vestry in favour of the project, putting the probable cost of the establishment including land at £30,000; but the Committee did not recommend any particular site, as the selection of that would come within the scope of the Commissioners if any were appointed. The Report of this Committee was printed and submitted to a Special Meeting of the Vestry in November last. It fell very fiat upon the Vestry and excited no interest whatever as is proved by the fact that it brought together but a small Vestry, and the motion for the adoption of the Report which would have required a majority of two thirds to carry it, was rejected by 20 to 15. It may not be without interest if a word or two is said upon the history of this movement in Shoreditch. In the year 1854 while the Vestry of the parish was an open one —i.e. open to every ratepayer to attend and vote—a proposal was 13 made to adopt the Baths and Washhouses Act. This motion was carried by a fair majority and the Act was formally adopted and nine Commissioners were appointed. At that time considerable difficulty was experienced in the search for a suitable site- At length the Commissioners selected some practically vacant land in the High Street where Calvert Street now stands ; and made a provisional purchase of the same from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for £8400. When the Baths Commissioners submitted the proposal to the Vestry for ratification and for permission to borrow the money required, the Vestry adjourned the consideration for six months. Whether the reason for this vote after the adoption of the Act was an objection to the site or to the cost, or possibly both, the official records do not say. The Commissioners accepted the resolution as a rejection of the scheme, They paid the legal costs of the provisional purchase, wound up their affairs and dissolved- In 1877 the subject was brought under the consideration of the Vestry as at present established. A committee was appointed which reported in favor of the adoption of the Act, but upon their recommendation being presented to the Vestry the motion for its approval was rejected by a resolution to postpone the consideration of the matter sine die. If Baths and Washhouses are essential to the cleanliness and health of the inhabitants of the poorer and crowded localities, it is a remarkable fact that with the exception of a comparatively small establishment at Poplar, one of the first to be established in the Metropolis, and one originally founded and enlarged by private means, but now taken over by the parish of Whitechapel, there is no Parochial Establishment of this kind east of St. Giles, Bloomsbury, and Tottenham Court Road. Even the Corporation of London which has in the Eastern District a considerable and poor population and which is always ready to expend its wealth upon Markets, Cemeteries, Lunatic Asylums, Prisons, Open Spaces &c. seems never to have regarded the provision of Baths and Washhouses as worthy of serious consideration. 14 THE LATE CHIEF SURVEYOR For some time past the question of removing the Chief Surveyor from his office on the ground of age and occasional infirmity has been under consideration, but upon which question conflicting views prevailed. In November last, the Paving and Sewer's Committee recommended to the Vestry that the Surveyor, Mr. G. C- Perrett.be awarded a pension upon his retirement of ^"ioo, (the amount allowed by Act of Parliament if the Vestry had been willing to grant the full scale at Lady-day last would have been £160,) the proposal to allow the £1oo was met by a counter proposal: "That in consequence of his advanced age and infirmity the services of Mr. Perrett, Chief Surveyor, be dispensed with" This was resolved by the Vestry on the 6th of December last. Subsequently in the month of February a further resolution was passed:— "That in lieu of notice the late Surveyor, Mr. Perrett, be offered one year's salary." Following this Resolution some communications were received from Mr. Perrett which the Vestry did not answer ; but after the Lady-day Quarter and upon the Vestry declining to pay a quarter's salary to Lady-day, a communication was received from Mr.Perrett's Solicitor. This was referred to the Parliamentary and Law Committee, and the result was an interview between Mr. Perrett and his Solicitor and the Committee, and on the 1st of May a recommendation from the Committee was brought up and read— "That the Vestry do pay Mr. Perrett a sum of £400 in full settlement of all his claims upon the Vestry, and that Mr. Perrett's connection with the Vestry cease immediately on this arrangement receiving the sanction of the Vestry. 'This was adopted by the Vestry and accepted by Mr. Perrett, a cheque for £400 was then drawn and from that time Mr. Perrett's office as Surveyor to the Vestry terminated.

THOS. STEVENSON, Analyst. 49 REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR. Surveyor's Department. Gentlemen, I beg to submit a summary of works, &c., carried out under the superintendence of the above Department during the year ending the 25th March, 1888. MAINTENANCE OF ROADS. The following quantities of material were supplied by the Contractors at the cost stated, and used on the Macadam and ballast roads in the parish during the year:— £ 8. (1. 308I yaids cube Broken Granite 222 3 11 209* „ „ Flints 65 10 11 2\ ,, Ballast 0 15 0 301 i ,, „ Hoggin 92 7 6 During the year 426 cubic yards of old pebbles, York, etc., were broken up, costing 3s. od., and loaded and carted for repairing the roads at a further cost of about £53 5s, od. One foreman and eight laborers on average were employed in the yard, and on the general repairs of the unpaved roads and over trenches opened by the Gas and Water Companies ; their wages for the year amounted to £405 13s. 4d. The sum of 3s. was also paid for Watchman's wages. The companies contributed £97 6s. 1o½d. for labour (exclusive of Foreman's time) and £228 19s. yd. for material required in the said repairs. In consequence of the use of the Steam Roller the unpaved roads are, generally speaking, in a satisfactory condition. 50 STEAM ROAD ROLLER. The Roller was at work 237 days during the past year, and about 14 men on average, under the direction of a foreman, to November 11th, 1887, were employed in scoring, rolling, sweeping and watching the highways; the amount expended in labour was £811 12s. 5d. Anew road foreman was appointed on December 6th, whose duties, in addition to the above, include the direction of Paviors and Masons. The following Table gives the roads that have been rolled, together with the cost of same, and other details:— 5i LOCALITY. Broken Guernsey Granite. MATERIALS AND COST.

Gentlemen, During the past year 4,752 births—2,402 males and 2,350, females ; and 3,296 deaths, were registered in this Parish; deducting 434 deaths of non-res1dents, which occurred in the Public Institutions, situated in this Parish. The death rate was 22.60 per 1,000 living, that is 1.74 per 1,000 above the average of the last five years Of the deaths in the Public Institutions, there were in Res1dents Non Res1dents There were in Shoreditch Infirmary 365 11 Hoxton House 9 61 North Eastern Hospital 4 84 Holborn Infirmary — 278 378 434 The statistics below given, show the rate of mortality in the different Registration Districts of the Parish :— Population Deaths Average per 1,000 living Holywell 7,376 127 17.21 St. Leonard 14,967 252 16.80 Hoxton New Town 29,937 566 18.09 Hoxton Old Town 28,036 567 20.20 Haggerston 46,275 1,350 29.10 88 The High rate of mortality ascribed to Haggerston district is due to the 369 deaths which occurred in Shoreditch Infirmary and in the North Eastern Hospital (both situate in Haggerston) these deaths are proportionately due to each of the five Registration districts. The exceptional mortality was due to the increased number of deaths from whooping cough and from chest diseases. There were 421 deaths from bronchitis, 264 from phthisis' and 185 from pneumonia, making a total of 870 deaths registered under the above headings as against 739 in the previous year 931 deaths occurred under one year of age; against 819 in the previous year. The deaths under five years of age were 1,506 against 970 in the previous year. 422 deaths occurred of persons 65 years of age; and upwards. As against 351 in the previous year, viz.:— 272 from 65 to 75, 114 from 75 to 85, 35 from 85 to 95, and one at 98. In the previous year 215 persons died between 65 and 75 years of age, 112 from 75 to 85, and 23 from 85 to 95. In childhood (from 1 to 5 years) the largest number of deaths was caused by lung disease, comprising 185 from bronchitis, 115 from pneumonia, and 64 from congestion of the lungs, &c. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were atrophy, and debility (167 deaths;) convulsions 85; whooping cough 202; premature birth 71; and diarrhoea 144. From the age of 55 and upwards 200 deaths were caused by bronchitis; 81 by heart disease; and 24 by paralysis; 173 were registered under the term of old age. ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 554 deaths, viz. :—26 by scarlet fever ; 15 by enteric ; 15 by diphtheria ; 70 by measles ; 203 by whooping cough ; 157 by diarrhoea ; and 68 by other zymotic diseases. Of the 203 deaths from whooping cough, 92 occurred in infants under one year of age, and 82 in infants between one and two years of age. 89 Of the 157 deaths from diarrhoea, 141 occurred in infants under two years of age. DISINFECTION.—This has been carefully attended to in all instances of infectious diseases, 361 houses were disinfected; the infected rooms fumigated by sulphur, and subsequently the windows kept open to expose the rooms freely to the oxydising influences of the open air. The walls of the room, where necessary, were stripped and otherwise cleansed. At the disinfecting oven 3,338 articles were disinfected, and the Sanitary Officer, Inspector Lear, reports that he has been able to secure the removal of 259 of the infected sick to the Asylums, and that he has generally experienced little difficulty in inducing these persons to the removal. Inspector Alexander reports that 1,148 premises were carefully inspected, and in 1,137, nuisances dangerous to health were found, and notices served requiring their abatement. In his report an account is given in detail of the various works that have been done to abate the nuisances; and it is there ev1denced that much has been done in the year to render the dwellings more suitable for health. Some of the alterations were structural, for instance to remove damp, 100 roofs were repaired. Some alterations were needed to carry away sewage products and for that purpose, 426 drains were repaired or replaced. Cesspools have mostly been abolished but they are now and then still found ; only six were discovered in the year. A great deal of attention has been given for some years past to securing the inhabitants improved closet accommodation, (i.e.) structures more fitted for the purpose, and more cleanly, by provision of increased water supply. 576 closets were cleansed and repaired, and water supply restored, or newly la1d on in 669 closets. Additional care has been bestowed in endeavouring to prevent sewage gases penetrating the basement rooms, and sleeping chambers, hence in 309 premises, waste pipes were securely trapped, or their connection with the drain cut off, rain pipes have also been disconnected from drains in 426 premises to prevent sewer gas entering bed rooms. 90 Much work has been done also in paving yards to keep the earth under and around the dwellings dry and pure, such dryness is indispensible for freshness, and to enable air to circulate through the surface earth, and disinfect by ox1dation any organic products that might accumulate and become poisonous. FREEHOLDERS AND LEASEHOLDERS. In referring to the improvements effected in many of the dwellings of this Parish, I cannot omit to mention, that the arrangements which exist and which are made from time to time between Freeholders and Leaseholders, whilst more or less profitable to themselves, have certainly not tended to promote the health of the Parish. On the contrary, the Leaseholders in many instances having regard to the termination of their interest in their property, have allowed their houses year by year, to become more and more decayed and dilap1dated. In the pending alterations in Local Government of the Metropolis, some power should be conferred on the Sanitary Authority of the Parish to enable them to exercise a reasonable degree of control over the agreements made between Freeholders and Leaseholders, leaving both to study their indiv1dual advantages but at the same time, taking care that whilst they profit by the general industry of the inhabitants of the Parish, and obtain tenants accordingly ; they must adapt their mutual arrangements to the requirements and the interest of the public health. Whilst the present system of leasing continues resulting in the construction and retention of houses unfit for the requirements of working men's families, like those in Wilmer Gardens (described in Inspector Alexander's Report, to which I direct attention) the product will be, as it has been the perpetuation of conditions, which gathers within the parish, numbers of sickly impoverished persons who become a tax on the ratepayers, and the diseases amongst them, increases the death rate of the Parish above that of some of the surrounding and more favoured districts, furthermore the position those persons occupy in the parish would probably be taken 91 by able bodied industrial inhabitants, who require to be near to their work ; if instead of these badly constructed and dilap1dated places, there were suitable houses for their accommodation. THE "EAST LONDON WATER COMPANY." The " East London Water Company " still continues to insist upon cisterns being retained in dwellings and workshops. They do this the Company sets forth, by right of the original powers conferred upon them by Parliament and those powers they are ev1dently disposed to strain to the utmost in their own immediate interest The inhabitants of the dwellings and workshops, therefore have to drink water polluted by unclean cisterns, and cisterns moreover that cannot be kept clean, in an atmosphere like that of London, yet the Sanitary Authority, has so far, appealed to the East London Water Company without inducing them to concede to the public, the right of drawing water direct from the main, without the intervention of cisterns. A somewhat similar difficulty was experienced with the New River Company, but with this difference that, that Water Company only required cisterns to be retained on the premises of moderately large sized houses not on the premises of small dwellings, whereas the East London Company make not even that exception ; and after a while the New River Company less and less insisted on the cisterns being retained. It is difficult to understand how it can be to the lasting interest of the East London Water Company to oppose this public want for whilst the Sanitary Authority has not hitherto been inclined to force this question on public attention it seems to your Medical Officer of Health that it cannot be allowed to continue long as it is, without appeal to the Authority which originally conferred on the Company the power they possess, but which they seem disinclined to exercise generously in the public interest. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. G. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health. 93 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. ST. LEONARD, SHORE DITCH, Sanitary Department, 25th March, 1888. To the Medical Officer of Health, SiR, I beg to present the following report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendence during the year ended 25th March, 1888, showing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement. Notices served requiring the abatement of nuisances injurious to health in 1137 premises WORKS DONE TO SECURE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.

Overcrowding abated in 7 premises Dead bodies removed from 3 „ Animals, kept so as to be a nusiance, removed from 4 „ Accumulation of dung and rubbish removed from 13 „ Smoke Nusiances abated in 1 „ Making a total of 5434 separate nusiances, dangerous to health, abated in 1137 dwellings. In addition to the ordinary notices served for the abatement of nusiances 519 letters have been written. To show the character of the work done during the year a few cases are given in detail, as follows: Nos. 62 to 80, WILMER GARDENS. These houses were reported to the Sanitary Committee to be unfit for habitation, and were viewed by the Committee, by whom I was instructed to communicate with the owner, with a view to secure the demolition of the premises. In reporting this Case I venture to direct attention to the principal points in the history of these houses, as they well illustrate the Sanitary evils attendant on the present leasehold system. (1). In promotion of Ground Rents, ten houses were crowded on a frontage measuring 120-ft. 7-in. which gave an average of 11 feet between the walls in each house, a w1dth utterly inadequate for dwellings. (2.) The houses were built of the most inferior bricks and wood, consequent upon the building owner's interest in the houses he erected, being limited to a term of years, and being thereby subject to a reduction of value year by year. (3.) Consequent on bad material, bad workmanship, narrow frontages, and smallness of apartments (none of which afforded elbow room for family life) there has been for many years past, and probably from the day when they were first occupied a process of disintegration going on, which it has been very difficult for the successive leaseholders to cope with. It has therefore been necessary repeatedly to serve notices to repair dilap1dations upon the owners, and thus, a few years ago under Sanitary Notices, walls and ceilings, floors, stairs, &c., were repaired and the yards 96 Were paved, water was la1d on to water closets, and dust bins prov1ded, but it was recognised then that the whole fabric of the houses was so much decayed, that in a few years they would of necessity be removed. Since then the houses have reverted to the Freeholders and a short period of neglect by the Freeholder, and the destructiveness of some of the tenants showed that they could no longer be continued as habitations The points above referred to, were pressed upon the attention of the Freeholder and within a month of the Committee's instructions, the ruinous old houses were demolished and carted away; and the ground is now to let upon building leases. Referring to the new buildings to be erected, I ventured to urge on the cons1deration of the Freeholder's Surveyor, that large rooms are necessary for poor people with families to move, and to breathe in, and that they are kept cleaner, and are not so liable to damage as small ones, and that the site of the ten houses was really only adapted for six houses. LEONARDS YARD, WILMER GARDENS. In this place there are many stables and workshops, all of recent construction. The surface of the roadway was unpaved, the loose gravel la1d down when the premises were opened was in a very filthy state, and could not possibly be kept clean. Notice was therefore served on the owner, requiring him to properly pave and drain the roadway, this has been done; the whole surface measuring 313 square yards, has been covered with cement concrete, la1d with proper slopes to one gulley and the drain rectified. Acting on my suggestion the owner has also prov1ded one of the dung receptacles designed by myself to mitigate the nuisance arising from the retention of dung in the pits in common use. It may be of interest to the public in connection with this case, to point out the advantages of the one receptacle, and the disadvantages of the other. DUNG RECEPTACLES. In cons1deration of the want of proper provision for the retention of horse dung and stable litter; even for a short time, and the nusiance and annoyance to the ratepayers arising therefrom, as to which frequent com plaints have been received. I have designed a new, and a Sanitary dung receptacle, the advantage of which will be better understood from the following description of the ordinary manner in which dung is accumulated in stables, and stable yards and its effects. 97 The old familiar receptacle is a pit usually several feet deep from which dung on removal has to be inconveniently dug and from that it follows generally that the lower stratum, however rotten and foul, is seldom disturbed from one years' end to another; such pits being usually uncovered their contents are alternately drenched with rain and heated with the sun, and are thereby usually reeking abominations. And it cannot be regarded as any real improvement that some pits are covered, for in such cases, the foul gases are condensed and from time to time on being liberated, pollute the air, and persons complain that thereby they are subject to nausea. To minimise the annoyance, inseparable from stables adjoining dwelling houses, I venture to recommend that dung pits, in all such cases be abolished, and that dung be retained only in receptacles constructed as follows : (1.) The bottom of the receptacle should be six inches above the adjoining pavement of yard, and formed of Portland Cement Concrete trowelled to a smooth face. 2.) The walls should be of substantial brickwork and also finished ins1de with Portland Cement trowelled to a smooth face. (3.) The cover should be a permanent fixture to protect the contents from rain and sun, and should be either of stone or substantial woodwork dressed with pitch and tar ins1de. (4.) The front should be fitted with a substantial wood frame, in the upper part of which there should be a sufficiently large opening for the free reception of dung and litter and for ventilation ; and in the lower section a substantial door, large enough to admit of the free removal of the contents, and the washing and purification of the interior from time to time. Experience shows that dung accummulations (which were previously intolerable nuisances) can now be kept in the new receptacle within a few feet of dwellings without annoyance. STEPHENS MEWS, HOXTON. The whole area of this place was paved and drained in a very defective manner, the surface could therefore not be kept clean. The owner's attention having been called to the conditions by letter, an interview was obtained, and it was not nccessary to serve a notice. Acting on my recommendation the owner has re-constructed a large part of the drain, and has repaved the whole area of the Mews, measuring 359 square yards with granite cubes in a very satisfactory manner. 98 CONTAGIOUS DISEASES ARTICLES DISINFECTED AT VESTRY'S OVEN.
