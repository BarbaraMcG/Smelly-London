LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY, BY E, EILLING & SON, BERMONDSEY STREET. 1860. FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. In conformity with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestry of the said Parish submit to the Parishioners a statement of their proceedings in the execution of the various powers vested in them. And an Account of their Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending the 25th March last. SURVEYOR'S REPORT, For the Year ending March 25th, 1860. Gentlemen, My Report of last year,was prefaced with some remarks on. the proposed works of the Southern Main Drainage, in which I gave a short description of the scheme, as far as it affected this Parish ; and also explained the requirements which it was designed to fulfil. And I stated that a contract had been advertised for the Southern High Level Sewer and its Effra Branch. I am now enabled to report that one of these works is in course of execution in several parts of this Parish, viz. —at Nunhead, at Dulwich, (where the work is being tunnelled) and also at or near Cold Harbour Lane,—a subsequent contract lately let, enbraces the continuation of the above down to the outlet at Erith Marshes, which works also are now in progress. I also stated, that the contract for the Low Level Sewer had not been advertised, neither am I at present, enabled to inform the Vestry of any progress having been made towards the execution of this work. I can, therefore, only reiterate the hope which I then expressed, " that no unnecessary delay will take place in putting this work into the hands of the contractors," as it alone, can provide the necessary requirements of Low Level Drainage for this Parish. 4 Pending the somewhat lengthened period which must necessarily elapse, ere the benefits sought from the last named work could possibly be obtained, I ventured in that report, again to refer to the proposition of the Earl Pumping Station, as suggested by me, to the Yestry, in a report dated September 16th, 1857, and I have the gratification of announcing that even, after so great a lapse of time, this work is now being carried into effect (and will probably in a few weeks be in operation) with a view, not only to the temporary advantages which I anticipated would result from it, but it also will become a permanent auxiliary to the Main Drainage Works, as a storm overflow. Until the completion of the Main Drainage Works before referred to, it will readily be conceived, that no great progress can be made with our LOCAL MAIN SEWERS, but, nevertheless, in localities from which the Yestry has received special applications, and from which, in most instances contributions have been received, works to some extent, and of a permanent character (as shewn by the table given below) have been constructed under the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, in such manner, that they will eventually form portions of the ultimate permanent Sewerage of the Parish. I would here beg to remark, it has been urged that the Yestry might reasonably anticipate the completion of the Main Drainage Works—and at once commence the construction of some portions of the Local Sewerage, so that the completion of the combined works might to some extent be simultaneous, and consequently hasten the much desired Sewer improvement of this Parish; but in this view I cannot coincide, and the 5 reasons which I now lay before you, will I trust prove the soundness of my opinions on this subject. It is well known that the portions of this Parish most iu need of improved Drainage are those, the levels of which lie some feet under high water mark, and where at a very small depth below the surface—the water bearing strata of sand and gravel exhibits itself. Now to execute Sewer Works in such ground as this, without an outlet, would entail considerable increased expense, and incur much risk; and indeed, in some parts of the Parish, it would be practically speaking, almost impossible. Whilst by delaying these works (however desirable, and upon the necessity for which, at the earliest possible period, no doubt can exist) until the deep Low Level Sewer is constructed, which will be much deeper than anything required for this immediate locality; the effect which I anticipate, will be to filter as it were the sub-strata, through which our Sewers Works will have to pass, and consequently render their execution safer, more economical and perfect. For these reasons therefore, which I trust have been made clear to the Vestry, I am of opinion, that it is not desirable to enter very largely at present into the execution of our Local Main Sewerage. The new Sewers constructed during the last year, as above referred, are BRICK SEWERS.

I beg also to report, that a scheme for the permanent Sewerage of a large portion of the Dulwich College Estate, has been under my consideration, in conjunction with the Surveyor of the Estate, Mr. Barry, which plan, when it has been thoroughly matured, will be laid before the Vestry for its approval. It is unnecessary for me to enlarge upon the ordinary matters of highways, building frontages, new streets, general improvements, and the many other matters which it has been my duty from time to time, during the past year, to bring before you. The Vestry records bear ample testimony to 7 the care and attention bestowed on these various subjects, by the respective Committees who have them in charge. LIGHTING. In the last.Twelve months, No. 8 additional public lamps have been erected, and No. 29 have been altered to improved positions.

C. REYNOLDS, Wells Street, Camberwell, SURVEYOR, July, 1860. 1859-60. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. ANNUAL REPORT BY J. S. Bbistowe, Jun. M.D., Lond., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital, Medical Officer of Health for Camberwell, Gentlemen, The year 1859 was, I am happy to say, a healthier one than its immediate predecessor ; the deaths registered therein for this parish being 1367, while those recorded in 1858 amounted to as many as 1440. 641 of the deaths were in males, 726 in females. In the sub-districts of Camberwell. and St. George's, the decrease in the number of deaths was considerable ; in Dulwich, however, there was an increase of 1, and in Peckham of 30. But the increase in the latter two localities was accompanied by a very considerable rise in the number of children born, and is probably to be looked on, therefore, rather as an indication of growth of population, than of deterioration in health. The actual numbers of persons dying in the several districts, were for Dulwich 20, for St. George's 364, for Camberwell 483, and for Peckham 500. But it should be added, that a portion only of the 483 deaths here assigned to Camberwell proper, belongs fairly to that sub-district; inasmuch as the whole number includes 66 12 occurring in the Workhouse, and 102 in the Lunatic Asylums, which, in forming a comparative estimate of the death rates of the several districts, ought to be proportionately divided between them. In both of these institutions, the deaths were considerably less numerous than last year. The mortality is generally, in consequence of inclemency of weather, greater during the first and last quarters of the year, than it is during the second and third ; but we find that there was a little variety in this respect during the year which has just passed. In the first three months the mortality was unusually high ; in the second, it dropped to the lowest figure, at which it has ever stood during my tenure of office ; in the third, it again became somewhat excessive; and in the fourth, it underwent a comparative diminution, and sunk below the average. The disturbing influences to which these fluctuations were due, are easily recognised on examining the tables appended to this report. During the latter part of the year 1858, we were suffering severely from epidemics of scarlet fever, measles and hooping-cough; and these, though diminishing in severity, still produced a considerable number of deaths in the first quarter of 1859, and rendered the mortality during that period unusually high. The excessive death-rate in the third quarter again was due to the very great prevalence of diarrhoea, and to its fatality, especially among the young. 494 children were cut off under 5 years of age, and 58 between 5 and 10; 17 persons died between 10 and 15, 26 between 15 and 20, 77 between 20 and 30, 113 between 30 and 40, 122 between 40 and 50, 114 between 50 and 60, 138 between 60 and 70, and 208 from 70 upwards. Infantile mortality, therefore, is still considerable, but is less by 33 than it was last year. It is less in every one of the districts except Peckham, and there the increase amounts only to one. The total diminution in the number of early deaths is the more satisfactory, in that it is 13 accompanied by a considerable increase in the number of births. The only periods of life, during which, the death rate has advanced, are those between 40 and 50, and above 70. In every other decennial interval there has been a marked, and in some instances considerable, diminution. 81 deaths will be found claesed under the head of "violence' privation, poison and premature birth;" 31 under that of "fever;" 4 under that of "diarrhoea and acute dysentery of adults ;" 82 under that of " scarlet fever and diphtheria;" 12 under that of "small pox;" 15 under that of "erysipelas, pyoemia and puerperal fever;" 183 under that of "diarrhoea, bronchitis and pneumonia of infants under three years of age ;" 66 under that of "measles, hooping-cough and croup;" 89 under that of " hydrocephalus and convulsions of infancy 182 under that of "phthisis and other tubercular diseases;" and 622 under that of " other diseases, chiefly chronic." Of the diseases just enumerated, several only call for remark. The deaths from hydrocephalus and infantile convulsions were less numerous by 19 this year than last. The mortality from hooping-cough, measles and croup sunk from 108 in 1858, to 66 in 1859 ; they prevailed chiefly in Peckham and St. George's, and were most fatal during the first quarter of the year. Again scarlet fever and diphtheria showed a diminished mortality, the deaths therefrom being 82 this year, against 143 last; these affections prevailed pretty equally throughout the entire year, but were most severe in Peckham. Small-pox and fever, on the other hand, shewed a decided increase. From the former the deaths rose from 7 to 12 ; it was fatal chiefly in Peckham, and in the first six months of the year. From the latter, the deaths increased from 20 to 31, and were most numerous in St. George's, but spread pretty uniformly over the whole twelve months. Further, deaths of young children from diarrhoea and acute pulmonary affections mounted from 126 to 183. Deaths from 14 these causes, in the several districts, were very nearly in proportion to the births, and hence more numerous in Peckham than in other parts of the Parish. These diseases (but diarrhoea more especially) prevailed with peculiar severity in the months of July, August and September, and produced during that period, a larger number of deaths than during the other nine months collectively. On striking a balance however between the increased severity of certain diseases, and the diminished intensity of certain others, the result is decidedly a favorable and gratifying one. The births of 2195 children (1101 boys and 1094 girls) were registered during the year. This is an increase of 94 on the returns of the former year; and exhibits an excess of no less than 828 over the deaths. It may have been observed that, during the last year or two, I have become more and more reserved in making comparisons between the health of this and that of other districts. In the present report, I have contented myself with giving a simple abstract of the mortality of the year, accompanied by a brief comparison with that only of the year immediately preceding. The reason of this increasing caution on my part is, not that I have any fear of contrasting our health with that of other parishes, but that the fallacies which beset such an inquiry are becoming from year to year more and more numerous and large, and consequently the results to be deduced from it proportionately untrustworthy. A comparison of health cannot be a just one, unless the true death-rates of the districts to be compared have been ascertained. And the death-rate can be ascertained only by a comparison of the actual number of deaths, with the actual number of the population among whom these deaths have been distributed. The first item in this inquiry we obtain regularly, and pretty accurately, from the returns of the district registrars ; 15 but the second item is furnished only at distant intervals—once in ten years, when the census is taken—and nine years have now elapsed since the last occasion of the kind. Now it has been ascertained that London generally increases in a tolerably uniform ratio. Consequently the number of its inhabitants can be pretty accurately estimated for any date between successive censuses, and its death-rate determined. But what is true of London, is not equally so of its separate constituent parishes. Thus, up to the last census, the increase of the population of Camberwell had been both much more considerable and, at the same time, much more irregular than that of London. It follows, therefore, that although the number of inhabitants in this parish might have been calculated with some degree of correctness shortly after the last census, and even for several years subsequently: it has become now, on the eve of another numbering of the people, quite impossible to form any estimate sufficiently accurate to be adopted as a safe basis of comparison. I should add, however, that the sources of fallacy, here pointed out, do not affect the calculations which I have given, and the comparisons which I have made of the health of the parish during the years 1858 and 1859. And I must repeat that the mortuary tables, accompanying this report, indicate a decided improvement in health ; and this, not merely by a diminished aggregate mortality, but by considerations deduced from the ages of the defunct, the nature and progress of the diseases which have prevailed, and the increased number of births. The sanitary works accomplished during the year terminating on the 2nd March, 1860, by myself and the Inspectors of nuisances acting under me, have been considerable, and I believe satisfactory. 2374 houses have been systematically inspected. As a result of these inspections, 280 houses have been whitewashed and cleansed, and 79 repaired ; 274 cesspools Lave been emptied, and 120 filled up and abolished ; 118 closets have been 16 provided, and 62 supplied with water; 307 drains have been trapped or amended; 78 houses have had water laid on for drinking purposes ; 56 dust-bins have been erected ; and 50 yards paved or amended. In addition to the above, 1358 nuisances arising from pigs, accumulations of dung, ashes, refuse, and sundry other matters have been removed or ameliorated ; the various mews have been systematically reported on, and cleared of rubbish; and the slaughter houses in the parish, 43 in number, have been regularly inspected ; and when necessary, have been cleansed and whitewashed, or had the paving amended, or other repairs executed. In the carrying out of the above works, it was deemed necessary, in 6 instances only, to apply for summonses ; and in three cases, at my recommendation, applications for the licensing of slaughter houses were withdrawn. Several trades—nuisances also of more or less importance have been from time to time brought under the notice of the sanitary committee ; the most important of which (one arising in the manufacture of Ostend butter from melted fat) was driven from the neighbourhood, in consequence of proceedings taken before the magistrate. I have continued to lay before you monthly analyses of the waters supplied by the water companies; the result of which has been still to shew that the fluid which you receive from them is reasonably pure and wholesome. Lastly, in consequence of the frequent out-breaks of smallpox, to which this parish, together with other districts of London, has been subject, I instituted (in conjunction with the district vaccinators) towards the close of the year, whose proceedings this report embraces, an examination of the children of the various charity schools throughout the parish, This work, 17 however, is still in progress, and the results (which have yet to be ascertained) will belong to a future occasion. I beg gentlemen, in conclusion, to thank you for the great personal kindness which you never fail to shew me, and for the constant encouragement and assistance which you continue to afford me in the performance of the duties of my office, And remain, Your obedient Servant, J.
