Samuel Rayson and Charles Edwin Watts were re-elected Churchwardens on Easter Tuesday, March 31st, 1891, Mr. Robert Stephens Cufflin being elected as their colleague. Messrs. William Henry Walkley, John-Thomas Johnson, and William Smith (since deceased), having been duly nominated by the Vestry, were appointed Overseers by the local Justices on the 10th April, 1891. The following appointments were made by the Vestry on Easter Tuesday, 1891:— As Commissioners of the Burial Board.—Messrs. John Spencer Furlong, Samuel Lambert, and Frederic James Minasi. As Assessors.—Messrs. Edwin Cox, Ilenry Charles Dove, George Samuel Elliott, Henry Samuel Friend, John Spencer Furlong, William Goodman, Thomas Hollyman, Joseph Henry Thomas Keeves, William Hepple Peacock, James May Stroud (since deceased), William Henry Walklev, and William Wells. f 7 As Solicitor.—Mr. William Lewis. As Sexton.—Mr. Horace B. Baker. As Inspector of Houses for Slaughtering Horses pursuant to 26 Geo. III, Ch. 71.—Mr. H. J. H. Tuck. 12 The Act under which the latter appointment was annually made by the Yestry is repealed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (vide p. 79), so that from the 1st January, 1892, the appointment ceased so far as the Yestry is concerned. The Assessment Committee was appointed on April 17th, 1891, pursuant to the Valuation (Metropolis) Act of 1869, and consisted of Messrs. Henry Abrahams, William Adams, Frederick Thomas Bailey, Joseph Harrison Brown, John Thomas Johnson, Samuel Lambert, James May, William Thomas Niblett, Arthur Rumbelow, William Smith (since deceased), Joshua Thompson and John Young. The nomination of Vestrymen and Auditors took place on Monday, May 25th, 1891. At the polls, which were held on the following day in Wards 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8, about 2,300 persons recorded their votes, the constituencies being estimated to contain 21,000 persons qualified to vote. There were 43 vacancies, and these were filled up by the re-election of 24 of the members who retired by effluxion of time, and of 3 who had been Vestrymen previously, and by the election of 16 entirely new to office. At the Poll in St. Peter's Ward, Mr. Churchwarden Watts, the officiating Chairman, in the exercise of what he no doubt believed to be a wise discretion, permitted the BallotBox to remain open a few minutes beyond the statutory hour (8 p.m.) in order to enable all the ratepayers within the polling station to vote. Mr. G. S. Elliott, one of the defeated candidates, raised the question of the validity of the election and obtained a writ of quo icarranto and a judgment of ouster against; the elected members Messrs. Doherty, Gladman, Kayes and Whetstone, who immediately resigned their seats. Mr. Elliott subsequently obtained a mandamus against the Vestry and Churchwardens to take the necessary steps for a new election. The Vestry accordingly, on November 6th, 1891, fixed Friday, December 4th, as the day for holding the election in St. Peter's, when Messrs. G. S. Elliott, W. Hirst, T. Osborn and F. J. Street were elected for the three years ending May, 1894. On May 29th, 1891, Messrs. John Alfred Grasemann, Matthew 13 Henry Hale, William Nodes, George James Raves, and Edward Cullum Smith (since deceased), were elected Auditors of the General and other Vestry Rates. The following permanent Committees were appointed by the Vestry on May 29th, 1891 :— FINANCE COMMITTEE. Wards. 1. Cussans, John Edwin 1. Davies, Griffith 1. Goddard, William 1.

Doherty, Gladman, Kayes and Whetstone, who resigned in June, 1891), were appointed on 18th December, 1891, upon the Sanitary and Works Committees as follows Sanitary Committee. Works Committee. Hirst, William. Elliott, George Samuel. Osborn, Thomas. Street, Frederick James. In July, 1891, Mr. John Lawrence, one of the original Commismissioncrs for Public Baths and Washhouses, resigned, and Mr. P. S. Cufflin was shortly after appointed to fill the vacancy. In the following November, Mr. Cufflin and Mr. J. T. Johnson retired by effluxion of time. Mr. Johnson was re-elected, but the vacancy caused by Mr. Cufflin's retirement was filled by the election of Mr. Wm. Goodman. Death was busy during the year amongst those connected with the local government of the Parish. On Sunday, May 3rd, occurred somewhat suddenly that of Mr. Wm. Smith, a representative of Upper Hollo way, who had only recently been appointed an Overseer of the Parish. This was followed, early in June, by that of Mr. Chas. Higgins, to whose career as Surveyor of the Parish reference is more particularly made in the annual report for last year. On November 16th, Mr. E. C. Smith, an old and respected tradesman of Upper llolloway, who had for some years served the Parish in the capacity of Auditor, passed suddenly away. In January, 1892, died, at the age of 79, Mr. James May Stroud, who, for over 40 years, had rendered invaluable services to the Parish as a member of the Board of Assessors. He, like his brother, whose death is recorded in the Report for the year ending Lady Day, 1887, was noted, not alone for the interest he had long taken in the local affairs of Islington, but for remarkable kindliness of character, which was recognised, as in his brother's case, by the number of old friends and colleagues who followed him to his grave. The changes which the physical features of the Parish had undergone during his lifetime 17 may be inferred from a remark be was in the habit of making to his friends to the effect that he remembered as a boy having shot snipe in Highbury Fields. Mr. W. H. Wimberley, a representative on the Vestry of the Ward of Highbury, died on February 24th, 1892. Dr. Charles Meymott Tidy, who had for nearly 20 years acted as the Medical Officer of Health for the Parish, died on the 15th March, 1892, at the comparatively early age of 49. In dealing with the career of a man so eminent in his profession as Dr. Tidy the following remarks from the Islington Gazette may with advantage be quoted:— Dr. Tidy, who was appointed Medical Officer of Health in 1872, in succession to Professor Corfield, was one of th® most distinguished analytical chemists of his time, and by his death, which took place after a protracted illness, at his residence, 3, Mandeville-place, Manchester-square, sanitary science loses a powerful demonstrator. He was early distinguished by his facility in popularising science, and attained considerable popularity as a lecturer to literary institutes all over the kingdom. On taking the appointment vacated, after a short experience, by Dr. Corfield, he had to sustain the prestige which Dr. Ballard had created for Islington as one of the foremost parishes to apply hygienic principles to its administration. He entered into the work with characteristic enthusiasm, and ere long his racy and pregnant reports became text-books amongst sanitarians. Meanwhile he pursued his chemical researches with such success that he became in constant request all over the kingdom as an expert, and he figured in several great trials where the point to determine was the presence of human blood. The Government largely utilised, his services, and although at times there were local objections, born of the narrower Vestry mind, to his extending his usefulness over the borders of Islington, his paramount usefulness to his country triumphed over small-minded prejudice. Before committees of the Houses of Parliament his evidence was in constant request, and a testimony of his influence was given before a committee of the House of Lords on Wednesday, March 16th, 1892, when Mr.Pember, Q.C., announcing his death, said his opinion carried almost unlimited, weight on water and sanitary questions with Parliamentary committees: while he was a household word with local authorities throughout the country. He held several scientific appointments, including, we believe, the professorship of Hygiene at the London Hospital. His twenty years' work in Islington stamped him as not merely a theoretical enthusiast, but a thoroughly practical sanitarian. He astonished some of his commentators by his scepticism as to the testimony of averages as demonstrating the existence of particular effects, and on one occasion he almost disheartened sanitarians by an attempt to prove that where mortality was reduced by the stamping B 18 out of certain diseases it was always equalised by the appearance of some other mortal malady. His dealings with some of the slums of Islington were, however, in the best sense of the word, emphatic. He refused from the first to tolerate the idea that a rookery could ever be made tolerable by patching, and one of his first raids was upon the old High-street slums, that finally disappeared under the sweeping conditions of Cross's Act. Dr. Wynn Westcott, who had recently resigned his position as a member of the Vestry, was appointed to temporarily discharge the duties of the office thus rendered vacant, the consideration of the permanent appointment being for the time deferred. The following Vestry men resigned their seats during the year:— Mr. Geo. Adams Ward 1, Upper Holloway. Mr. G. H. Judd „ ,, ,, Mr. J. R. Priestley ,, ,, „ Dr. Wm. Wynn Westcott Ward 2, Lower Holloway. Mr. Abraham Jones Ward 5, Barnsbury. Mr. E. B. Camps Ward 8, St. Peters. Mr. P. J. Doherty ,, „ Mr. Thos. Gladman „ „ Mr. Geo. Kayes „ ,, Mr. Fredk. Whetstone ,, „ In October, 1891, the Trustees of the Cloudesley Charity Estate appointed Mr. Brinsley Harper, of 4, Beresford Terrace, Highbury, Solicitor, their Clerk in the place of Mr. Oldershaw, deceased. In December, 1891, the Sanitary Committee, together with some additional Members from the General Purposes and Works Committee, was constituted a Public Health Committee, for the purpose of administering more effectually the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; and in the following January the Sanitary Committee was dissolved, and its duties and powers transferred to the recently constituted Public Health Committee, which was at the same time constituted a Committee for the purposes of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. 19 VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The number of Meetings during the year have been:— Vestry 31 Finance Committee 59 Assessment Committee 19 Assessors 24 Excuse Committee 4 General Purposes Committee 49 Public Health Committee 18 Sanitary Committee 31 Works Committee 52 „ Northern District Sub-Committee 23 ,, South Eastern „ „ 24 „ „ Western „ „ 21 ,, Horse and Depot Sub-Committee 55 Special Committees 24 Total 434 ACREAGE AND POPULATION. The area of Islington is 3,107 statute acres. The full details of the census taken on April 6th, 1891, are not yet obtainable. The population was then shown to be 319,422, with 38,259 inhabited houses. ASSESSMENT AND RATEABLE VALUE. Since the issue of the report for 1890-1891 several Appeals then pending have been heard and settled; but a complete report of the result has not yet been received from the Assessment Committee. As regards, however, the most important, that of the Gas Light and Coke Company, it will be remembered that it was intimated in the report of the Assessment Committee attached to the Annual Report of last year that the Assessment Committees of several other parishes which contained Works and Mains belonging to the Company and which had received notice of appeal had agreed to unite with the Assessment Committee of this Parish for the purpose of fighting the case. The assessment of the Company in Islington had been fixed at £60,000 Gross and £54,490 Rateable Value, these figures having B 2 20 been arrived at in the same method and upon the same lines in respect of the Company's current accounts as in previous Quinquennial Valuations, while the number of houses newly erected during the previous five years had also been taken into consideration. The Appellants claimed a reduction to £19,364 gross, and £17,396 rateable value, and contended, not only that there had been a considerable depreciation in the value of the gas receipts and more especially that their working expenses and the cost of coal had considerably increased, but that as regards Islington the original valuation had been calculated upon incorrect principles. The hearing of the consolidated appeals, after occupying the Court for twenty-five days, concluded on the 23rd March, 1892, when the rateable value of the Company's works, mains, and pipes throughout the Parish of Islington was reduced to £28,873. "While loyally accepting this decision it is but fair to point out that Islington was greatly handicapped by having to combine with parishes which had nothing like the same interests at stake. It is also to be regretted that after such a heavy outlay in costs on both sides the judgment of the Court merely amounted to the adoption of certain figures, somewhere meanway between those put forward by the respective Assessment Committees and those submitted by the Company, and that no principles were laid down for the guidance of Overseers or Assessment Committees in regard to the future valuation of this and similar undertakings. The magnitude of this appeal and of the interests involved may to some extent be appreciated by bearing in mind that it lasted over a period of about 18 months, that there were 15 respondent Assessment Committees, and that 21 Counsel and 15 expert Valuers were engaged in it, and further that the shorthand writer's notes, a copy of which is bound for reference, cover 767 foolscap pages. The costs of the Company are understood to have been over £11,000. Those of the Parish of Islington, including its taxed share of the Appellants' costs, will, it is to be feared, be very considerable. The Royal Agricultural Hall Company's appeal was based on the question of maintenance and annual profits, and on the receipts and expenditure in connection with the various exhibitions annually held. 21 This appeal was compromised, and the assessment reduced from £5,675 Gross and £4,563 Rateable to £5,500 Gross and £4,000 Rateable each party paying their own costs. The appeal of the Midland Railway Company in respect of that portion of the Tottenham and Hampstead Railway which runs through Islington, and which connects the Midland Railway at Kentish Town with the Great Eastern Railway at Tottenham was also compromised. Particulars as to the nature of this appeal were set forth in the Report of the Assessment Committee attached to the Annual Report of last year. The result of the compromise was a reduction of £400 in the Rateable Value. These appeals have necessarily been very expensive, and having regard to the nature of the professional assistance employed, particularly in the case of the Gas Light and Coke Company, some time must necessarily elapse before complete accounts can be rendered. Since Lady Day, 1891, 530 new buildings have been erected and assessed, the district chiefly affected being the Whitehall Park Estate, Upper Holloway. On the other hand, the assessments of 419 properties have been reduced on evidence of a depreciation in value. The total increase from new properties and structural additions amounts to £7,222 gross and £5,946 rateable, giving a grand total of £2,047,260 gross &nd £1,704,398 rateable, as the valuation of the parish at Lady Day, 1892. RATES. The rates made by the Vestry during the year amounted to 5s. 0d. in the £, a reduction of ½d. in the £ upon those for the previous year The details are as follow:— Made on the 6th Feb., 1891. Made on the 31st July, 1891. Total. Rates for previous year. s. d. s. d. s. d. s. d.

Od. in the £), the Vestry is responsible for not quite 1s. 4½d., the remainder being required to meet the precepts of other Boards over whose expenditure the Vestry can exercise no control.

Of this latter amount £17,700 19s. 5d. is accounted for by empty property, reduced assessments, and commission allowed to owners under Section 3 of the Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act. The losses from "runs" and rates excused amounted to £1,841 6s. 9d., or about 8s. 6d. per cent, of the total debit. Upon comparing the following table with, that in last year's Report it will be seen that the percentage of "empties," &c. and losses have both slightly decreased. Year ending Lady-day.

For the past year the average number per 23 quarter has been 1,512, as against 1,806 for last year, and 2,010 for 1889-90. 25,233 summonses for non-payment of rates have been issued during the year, a reduction of about 400 on the number issued last year. Of the persons summoned each quarter (on an average 6,308), about 1,100 appeared to ask for time. 3,155 distress warrants were handed to the brokers, and in 161 cases it was found necessary to levy but in very few of these were the goods actually sold. Out of 54 committal warrants obtained, 29 persons paid prior to or upon arrest, 15 absconded, 7 were conveyed to Holloway Prison, and 3 were abandoned. The total amount received by the vestry Clerk during the year in respect of summons fees was £1,162 8s. 6d. This amount was paid over to the Vestry's Bankers to the credit of the General Rate in accordance with the terms of his appointment. HIGHWAYS. The cost of labour on the roads during the year amounted to £11,473 3s. l0d. as against £12,787 1s. 1d. for the year ending Lady-Day, 1891. This decrease (£1,313 17s. 3d.) is accounted for by there being but a small expenditure for extra labour in the clearing away of snow. The following table shews the quantities and cost of materials used in the repair of the roads and footways, in the formation of pitched channels and crossings, and in improvement works.

A less quantity of granite has been purchased for the repair of the macadam roads than last year, the macadam removed from parts of Holloway Road and Highgate Hill prior to those roads being paved with granite setts having been utilized for repairing macadam roads in other parts of the Parish. Notwithstanding this, the total expenditure is, owing to the increase in price of all road materials and of Masons' and Paviors' work, and to the fact that a greater quantity of the latter work has been executed than during the previous year as stated above, in excess of that for the previous year. MACADAM ROADS. The following have been converted from flint into macadamized roads:— St. John's Road, from Holloway Road tp Miranda Road. Elthorne Road, from Summerfield Road to Hazellville Road.

STREET WATERING. Carbolic Acid has been mixed with the water for watering certain streets during the hot weather when necessary. The quantity of water used for watering the streets, steam rolling, and washing pitched roads was 45,778,000 gallons, for which the Vestry paid £1,852 6s. Id. including the rent of meters.

Banbury Street, Newington Green Road, and Stroud Green Road, twice instead of once weekly. Two additional sweeping machines have been purchased, and painted by the Vestry's workmen, the total cost being £112. SNOW STORMS. There have been three falls of snow during the year. On the 8th January, 1892, about ½ an inch of snow fell, and inasmuch as the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, had cast upon the Local Authorities 29 the duty of clearing the snow from the footways, additional men were engaged, who with the Vestry's workmen were employed in removing the snow from the footways in the principal thoroughfares. On the night of the 15th February, 1892, snow fell and continued falling until the early hours of the morning of the following day, when it lay to a depth of from three to four inches. Additional men were again engaged and the footways and carriageways in the main roads were cleared, the snow being melted by means of salt and water and swept down the gulleys. A further fall of 2 inches of snow occurred on the night of the 17th of February, and on the night of the 19th it fell to a depth of 1 inch. Similar action was taken in regard to these falls as with those previously referred to. On the 9th of March, 1892, snow fell to a depth of 1£ inches, and on the following day a like fall occurred. On both occasions additional men were engaged and the footways in the main roads were cleared. The total cost of the work done in connection with these snow storms amounted to £975 4s. 10d., of which amount the sum of £683 Is. 2d. was paid to the extra men employed. SANDING ROADS. 1,807 loads of sand and other material have been spread on the roads on thirty one days when they were in a slippery condition. The cost of the material and labour amounted to £380 lis. 3d. IMPROVEMENT WORKS. Highgate Hill.—South-west side.—Two sets of steps with iron guard railings have been constructed at points opposite No. 15, West View, and 85 feet north-west of Despard Road respectively, to facilitate the approach to and from the high pavement on this side of the road at a cost of £20 0s. 2d.

The new buildings on part of the ground at the rear of the Manor Dairy Company's premises and between those premises and Findon Terrace have been erected and the ground referred to given up in accordance with the above conditions. The carriageway has been widened and a kerbed and paved footing laid at a cost of % £154 12s. Id. This improvement has effected a widening of the road which by No. 1, Findon Terrace was only 29 feet, and at a point 109 feet north-west of Hanley Road only 37 feet 4 inches wide. Hornsey Rise.—South-west side from and including No. 1 to No. 5.— The owner of property abutting on this part of the road being desirous of pulling down Sylvan Cottage and erecting two new buildings on the site in advance of the front of the building to be removed and of bringing out the front of No. 1 to the same proposed line, the London County Council consented to this being done on condition that the ground in front was given up and added to the public way. The ground, which had an average width of 6 feet and contained 393 feet super, has accordingly been given up and added to the public footway and paved at a cost of £18 10s. 8d. Elthorne Road.—North-west side, by Sunnyside Road.—The circular corner of the footway, which projected so far into the carriageway as to cause great inconvenience to vehicles turning it, has been improved by setting back the kerb at the corner 8 feet, and adding a portion of the footway (100 feet long by an average width of 4 feet) to the carriageway, resetting the kerb and part of the footway paving, and extending the pitched crossing over Elthorne Road to the improved line, at a cost of £20 19s. 5d. Grove Road.—South-cast side, from No. 108 to Hornsey Road.—A strip of land of an average width of 2 feet 7 inches and containing 166 feet super having been given up by the owner of the premises 31 abutting upon it at the time of erecting new buildings this land has been added to the footway which has been widened, and a pitched channel laid. The cost of the work amounted to £17 8s. 2d. Hornsey Road.—South-west side, between St. Mark's Mission Hall and Grove Road.—The owner of this land being desirous of erecting ten new shops in advance of the general line of buildings, the London County Council consented to this being done provided the fronts of the buildings were erected at a distance of 45 feet from the opposite side of the road and the ground in front given up and added to the public way. Although only five of the shops have been erected the ground in front of the site of the whole of the proposed number has been given up. The ground referred to was 10 feet 6 inches wide and contained 1,963 feet super. The carriageway and footway have been widened, a pitched channel laid and the footway paved, the cost of the work amounting to £193 9s. 9d. Ilornsey Road.—South-west side, from No. 193 to St. Mark's Mission Hall.—The owner having set back the fences and walls of the property abutting on this part of the road to a distance of 45 feet from the opposite side of the road and given up the ground in front on condition that the Vestry made up the same and added it to the public way, the ground referred to has been made up, the carriageway and footway widened, a pitched channel laid and the footway paved, at a cost of £799 5s. 3d. This ground had an average width of 7 feet 6 inches, and an area of 6,926 feet super.

Holloway Road.—North-cad side, between Seven Sisters Road and Lister Mews.—The steep and dangerous tar paved margin of the footway has been abolished by the formation of paved terraces, the paving of the footway relaid and repaired, and the portion of the tar paved slopes between the top terrace and the edge of the paving has been flagged^ thus materially increasing the width of the paved footway. An improved curve has been made in the kerb at the corner of Seven Sisters Road by the Nag's Head Public House by taking off a small portion of the footway and adding it to the carriage- way. The total cost of these works amounted to £835 0s. l0d. Highbury Park.—Between No. 70 and No. 245.—The owners of the North Holme and the South Holme estates, being desirous of laying out their property for building purposes, have set back the boundary fence abutting on the east side of this road, between the above mentioned points, a distance varying from 50 to 65 feet from the west side of the road; and the Vicar and Churchwardens of St. John's Church on the opposite side of the road have also consented to the setting back of the boundary fence of the church premises an average distance of 15 feet. The whole of the ground outside the fences referred to has been given up and added to the public way, making the road, which had formerly a width of 28 and 35 feet, 62 feet wide. Paved footways and pitched channels have been formed on both sides of the road, pitched crossings laid over Northolme and Sotheby Roads, the carriageway made up and the severe incline near the site formerly occupied by North Holme lessened by taking about 2 feet off the crest of the hill. The total cost of the works amounted to £967 12s. 9d. Hillmarton Road.—North-east side, at the flank of the Holloway Cattle P. II.—The kerb and footway paving have been reset to improved levels in order to enable the new pitched channel being laid at a better gradient for draining the road. The cost of the work amounted to £10 0s. 11d. 33 Green Lanes, Albion Road, and Matthias Road.—A proposal to widen these roads by Newington Green has been for some time under consideration by the Hackney Board of "Works, the South Hornsey Local Board, and the Vestry, and during the past year a plan prepared by the Chief Surveyor to the Vestry for the improvement of the roads in question was adopted by these authorities. The South Hornsey Board agreed to acquire the property and to carry out the works necessary for widening those portions of Green Lanes and Albion Road which were in their district, and the Hackney Board and the Vestry came to a similar understanding with regard to the property and the work in their respective districts. The two latter bodies approached the London County Council with a view to obtaining a contribution towards the cost of the property required for the improvements in their districts which it was estimated could be purchased for £6,574 0s. 0d. with the result that the Council has agreed to contribute the sum of £3,025 0s. 0d., of which £1,650 0s. 0d. is to be applied towards the purchase of the property in the district of the Hackney Board and £1,375 0s. 0d. to a similar purpose in this Parish. The Vestry has purchased the property required for widening Green Lanes between Newington Green and the Parish Boundary opposite No. 32, which consisted of a strip of ground on the west side of the road having an average width of 19 feet and an area of 906 yards super, for the sum of £1,500 0s. 0d., and the work of widening the road on the west side is in progress. The widening of the footway on the east side of the road cannot be proceeded with until the South Hornsey Board has obtained the property required for widening that part of the road in front of Holland House, the purchase of which, however, will shortly be completed. The Vestry is in communication with the owner of the property required for widening Matthias Road. Woodville Road.— West-side, from No. 37 to Matthias Road.—A paved and kerbed footway has been formed with old materials at a cost of £11 10s. 0d. Highbury Crescent.—East-side, from No. 12 to 19.—Old kerb redressed has been laid to the gravel footing round the outside of Highbury Fields, in continuation of that referred to in the report for last year, at a cost of £15 3s. 2d., thus completing the kerbing of the whole of this footway. 34 George*s Road.—For the purpose of carrying George's Road through into Roman Road, a piece of ground attached to the Pocock Arms P. H., having a frontage of 35 feet to Roman Road and containing an area of 2,781 feet super, has been purchased by the Vestry for the sum of £1,100 0s. 0d., the money being raised by loan from the London County Council. George's Road is now being continued through the ground. Bentley Road.—A strip of previously enclosed ground averaging 2 feet in width and 80 feet in length having been given up by the owner of the adjoining promises on the western side of this road and added to the carriageway, the whole surface from Balls Pond Road to a point 100 feet south thereof has been paved with redressed pitching, the gradient improved and the footway repaired at a cost of £60 16s. 8d. Balls Bond Road.—North side betiveen Balls Pond Place and Newington Green Road; and Newington Green Road, east side between Balls Pond Road and No. 6.—The owners of the corner premises abutting upon these roads having given up a strip of ground averaging 3 feet 2 inches in width and containing 284 super feet, the same has been paved, the previously existing lines of kerb set back and the carriageways thereby widened, the additional width thus added in Balls Pond Road being paved with new gratite pitching.

Nine new trees have been planted to replace dead ones in the following roads at a cost of £5 12s. 6d.:— St. John's Park—7. Hanley Road—2. New cast iron tree gratings have been fixed round all the trees which were planted in the footwavs last year, at a cost, including the mason's work in fixing the same, of £172 5s. 4d. The cost of maintaining the trees in public roads has amounted to £103 3s. 11d. 37 ARCHWAY ROAD. Twenty-four houses with shops haying been erected on the northeast side of the road north of Thomas St reet, the vestry resolved to put the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts in force to compel the owners of property in and abutting on the road to make and pave it as a new street. A strip of ground having an average width of 10 feet 8 inches and containing an area of 5,553 feet super having been given up and added to the public way by the owner of the property between Thomas Street and Archway Villas, in compliance with a condition imposed by the London County Council when giving consent to the erection of the shops in advance of the general line of buildings in that part of the road, the kerb has been set back between a point 50 feet north-west of Flowers Mews and No. 2, Archway Villas, the carriageway and footway widened, and a pitched channel laid; and the footway on the north-east side of the road has been paved between Flowers Mews and Archway Villas. The whole of the work has been done at the expense of the owners of property in the road. HIDES STREET. The School Board for London having obtained a provisional order under the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, empowering them to take Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10, Hides Street, and also the portion of the street, about 54 feet in length on which those premises abut, the street has been stopped up and appropriated by the Board. The vestry owned the paving in the portion of the street referred to, and this the Board was required to take up and deliver to the Vestry's depot. WORKHOUSE LANE. In the annual report for last year it was stated that the Vestry was taking steps to get this lane closed. Daring the past year the magistrates have, on the application of the Vestry, made an order for closing it on the understanding that the Guardians should purchase a piece of ground between the north-east angle of Cressida Road and the north-west end of the lane sufficient to admit of the making of a road 40 feet wide, and that the vestry should make the road and construct a sewer therein at their expense in substitution for the thoroughfare thus closed. The works have been carried out, and the lane closcd and added to the workhouse grounds. The Guardians have given up a 38 piece of land at the north-west corner of the workhouse grounds containing 722 feet super, and this has been added to the new road; a 9 inch pipe sewer and the necessary gullies have been constructed at a cost of £49 1s. 11d. (of which amount, however, the vendor of the ground is liable to pay £22 2s. 5d.), and pitched channels and paved and kerbed footways have been formed on both sides at a cost of £162 13s. 2d. WAGES OF THE VESTRY'S WORKMEN. The Works Committee has had under consideration the question of the wages of the workmen employed by the Vestry with the result that during the year ending Lady Day, 1892, the vestry has on the Committee's recommendation increased the wages paid to most of the men in its employ. The subjoined table shows the result. The Vestry has also adopted a scheme providing for the men engaged in the Sewers and the Horse and Depot departments when unable to work in consequence of illness or injury received while on duty.

The attention of the Vestrv has been again directed to the disgraceful state of Askell Mews, Blackstock Road, which, it will be remembered, has been the subject of much discussion and negociation for some years past. The decision of the Vestry in April, 1890, to purchase the property for the sum of £3,000 was unfortunately rendered abortive by the action of the County Council, with the result that the opportunity of carrying out the improvement at a reasonable price passed away. The Vestry is given to understand that a more reasonable spirit now prevails in the Council, and it has accordingly referred the matter to its "Works Committee with a view to some step being taken to carry out the proposed improvement. It is, however, extremely doubtful whether anything can now be done except at a greatly increased cost. NEW STREETS. 3,930 feet in length of roadway have been made, and 5,190 feet in length of footway flagged by the Vestry during the past year pursuant to its powers under the Metropolis Local Management Acts. The provisions of the Metropolis Management Act Amendment Act, 1890, were put in force to repair spme 687 feet of carriageway, and 635 feet of footway in Highbury Mews, between Calabria Road and the north end of the Mews. £4,602 0s. 4d. has been received during the year from owners of property, while £4,657 14s. 6d. has been paid by the Vestry during the same period for the making and paving of "New Streets." The following are the streets in which work has been carried out during the year:— Arvon Road, between Ronald's Road and Melgund Road. Melgund Road. Witherington Road. Providence Place. Beversbrook Road, between Mercers Road and Tytherton Road. Andover Gardens. Andover Grove. Tytherton Road. 40 Liberia Road. Fergus Road. Alsen Road, north-west of Bedford Terrace, part.

Hornsey Road, between Isledon Road and Seven Sisters Road (footpaths). Table A (attached) gives particulars of work done during the year. LIGHTING. The number of street lamps at Lady Day, 1892, was 4,502, gas being supplied to them at the cost of 2s. 2d. per 1,000 feet. 143 new lamps have been erected during the year, of which 70 were of the recently introduced ornamental pattern with improved lanterns. 42 The old columns and lanterns have been removed from City Road, Qoswell Road, Newington Green Road, and from a portion of Green Lanes, and ornamental columns with improved lanterns substituted. The total cost of the gas supplied to street lamps for the year (including lighting, extinguishing and cleaning) amounted to £12,827 10s. 10d., as against £12,518 5s. 0d. for the previous twelve months. £708 0s. 9½d. was expended in the purchase of now columns, lanterns and fittings, and for the general maintenance of street lamps. New refuge lamps have been fixed in Holloway Road opposite the south-east side of Junction Road, in Sunnyeide Road by Elthorne Road, and in Mercers Road, by Yerbury Road. The positions of 79 lamps have been altered, the lighting of 39 has been discontinued, and 110 street name tablets have been fixed upon lamps which are in suitable situations at the corners of streets. The substitution of 16 inch lanterns for old 14 inch lanterns has been continued, 31 of the former having been put up during the year. Permission has been given for the erection of private column lamps on the footway at the undermentioned places, an agreement having been entered into by the owner of the lamps in each case:— 2 in front of Holloway Hall, Holloway Road. 9 in front of Nos. 136a, 136, 138, 140a, 140, 142, 144a, 144 and 146, Seven Sisters Road. 2 in front of Middleton Hall, Almeida Street. 4 in front, of Nos. 358, 360, 364 and 366, Holloway Road. 2 in front of Nos. 442 and 444, Holloway Road. Six convictions have been obtained at the Police Courts against persons found guilty of wilfully extinguishing street lamps. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. No steps having been taken as mentioned in the last Annual Report by the House to House Electric Supply Company to carry the Order obtained by them iu 1890 into effect, a correspondence ensued 43 between the Board of Trade and the Company, from which the Vestry inferred that the Company had not made the required deposit of £1,000 or satisfied the Board that they were in a position to efficiently discharge the duties and obligations imposed upon them by the Order. The Vestry accordingly requested the Board of Trade to exercise its powers by revoking the Order, a request which the Board complied with as from the 10th July, 1891. In June, 1891, notices were received by the Vestry from Messrs. Sharp & Kent, Electrical Engineers, of 34, Victoria Street, "Westminster, and from Mr. Sydney Morse, of 4, Fenchurch Avenue on behalf of the County of London Electric Lighting Company, Limited, of their intention to apply to the Board of Trade for provisional Orders authorising them respectively to supply electricity in the parish. Both applications were proceeded with, and drafts of the Orders were taken into consideration by the Vestry. In the case of the Order promoted by Messrs. Sharp & Kent, under the title of the "St. Mary, Islington, Electric Supply Order," the whole of the Parish was scheduled as the area in which the undertakers were to be authorised to supply electricity. The draft Order agreed in the main with the model Order issued by the Board of Trade. The Vestry, however, had at this time in view the possibility of itself supplying the Parish with electricity and declined to give its consent to the Order in the form deposited although it intimated its willingness to do so in respect of the area then supplied by the promoters under their arrangement with Mr. Beale as mentioned in the report for 1889-90. This proposal did not give satisfaction to Messrs. Sharp & Kent. The Board of Trade ultimately refused to grant the Order on the ground that the promoters had failed to produce the consent of the local authority or to satisfy the Board that it should be dispensed with. The County of London (North) Electric Lighting Order was also drafted in accordance with the model Order of the Board of Trade, but the Vestry, for similar reasons to those just mentioned, refused to give its consent. In January, 1892, the Vestry appointed a special Committee consisting of 20 members to inquire into the working of the various 44 electric lighting systems and to ascertain what would be the probable expense of introducing the light into the main thoroughfares of the parish. This Committee was also instructed to draw up a report to the Vestry setting forth the comparative cost of gas and electricity. The matter was under consideration at Lady Day last. SEWERS AND DRAINS. During the past year new sewers have been constructed in the undermentioned parts of the parish. Under Special Contracts.

Thunderstorms with very heavy rainfalls occurred on the 27th and 30th July, 1891, the sewer under the Tottenham and Hampstead Railway being overfull on each occasion. On the first mentioned D 50 date the water rose to a height of 2 feet 4 inches above the rails at Crouch Hill Station, and 1 foot above the rails at Hornsey Road Station, the traffic on the railway having to be suspended for threequarters of an hour. On the latter date the water rose 4 inches above the rails at Crouch Hill Station, and 12 inches at Hornsey Road Station. On the 2nd August, 1891, several very heavy falls of rain occurred, the water rising to a height of 3 feet 6 inches above the rails at Crouch Hill Station, and 1 foot 3 inches at Hornsey Road Station. On this occasion the London County Council's Northern High Level Sewer was running full in Holloway Road opposite No. 416 and was overfull opposite No. 417, and its Fleet Branch Sewer in Caledonian Road was overfull between Caledonian Crescent and Lyon Street.

Seven Sisters Road at Russell Road and Palmerston Road. Andover Road at Durham Road. Durham Road at Paddington Street. Hornsey Road near Citizen Road. Balls Pond Road, between No. 166, and Kingsbury Road. The last storm occurred on the 27th August, 1891, when the water from the sewer under the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway rose 9 inches above the top of the rails at Crouch Hill Station. With a view to-relieving the sewers in Hornsey Road south-east of Seven Sisters Road and in Seven Sisters Road between Hornsey Road and Fonthill Road, and to preventing'the flooding of the basements of the premises in portions of Fonthill'and Seven Sisters Roads, a scheme has been prepared by the Chief Surveyor for diverting the water flowing along the Fonthill Road sewer into the sewer in Seven Sisters Road and for conveying it into the Northern High Level sewer by the construction of a 21 inch pipe sewer in Isledon Road from Coleridge Road across Seven Sisters Road to Fonthill Road. This scheme also contemplates the construction of a 3 feet 9 inch by 2 feet 6 inch brick sewer in Tollington Park from Hornsey Road to a point 120 feet northeast of Wray Crescent for conveying the sewage and storm water from the district bounded by Tollington Park, Stroud Green Road, Hanley Road, and Hornsey Road which at present flows through the sewers along Alsen Road, Andover Road, and Durham Road into the sewer in Seven Sisters Road, and thus relieving the sewer in the latter road. This scheme, which is estimated to cost £1,200, has been adopted by the Vestry and will shortly be carried out. d 2 52 BUILDING AND DRAINAGE NOTICES. Plans and notices Have been submitted to the Vestry under and pursuant to the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Acts in respect of the drainage of the following buildings in the parish:— Houses 203 Shops 26 Model Dwellings 1 Factories 5 Workshops 18 Warehouses 3 Public Baths and Wash-houses 2 Schools 1 Stables 14 Couch-houses 1 Sheds 4 Offices 2 Engine-rooms 2 Billiard-rooms 1 Ironing-rooms 1 Smithies 1 Halls 1 Studios 1 W. C.'s 5 Additions to existing Buildings 22 404 Notices of intention to re-drain existing Buildings 178 582 In connection with the drainage of now and existing buildings, 167 trapped connections have boon made with brick sewers, 58 junctions with pipe sewers formed, and 22 feet of 18 inch, 53 feet of 53 12 inch, 374 feet of 9 inch, 4,936 feet of 6 inch, and 35 feet of 4 inch pipe drains (making in all a total of 224 outlet drains) have been laid under the public ways of the parish. These works were carried out at private expense, the cost, amounting to £1,005 l1s. 5d , having been first deposited with the Vestry by the persons for whom the works were executed, in accordance with estimates prepared by the Surveyor. 424 houses have been drained or re-drained at private expense, the work in conncction therewith, which included the laying of 132 feet of 12 inch, 305 feet of 9 inch, 26,687 feet of 6 inch, and 11,898 feet of 4 inch glazed stoneware pipes, the construction of 230 inspection chambers, the fixing of 212 intercepting traps, 374 ventilating pipes, 497 closet pans, and 1,177 trapped gullies, having been carried out under the supervision of the Surveyor. The approximate cost of this work was £6,643 17s. 6d. The Yestry, on the 4th March, 1892, approved and adopted regulations, prepared by the Chief Surveyor, respecting drains and sanitary arrangements of houses and other buildings. These regulations will, no doubt, lead to the more perfect sanitation of houses and other buildings hereafter to be erected or rc-draincd. PROPOSED INTERCEPTING SEWER FROM CROUCH HILL TO HOLLO WAY ROAD. In connection with the proposed intercepting sewer to take the storm water from the north-eastern portion of Upper Holloway, referred to in the last annual report, it is understood that the Main Drainage Committee of the London County Council have been advised by their Engineer that the proposed use of the Ilolloway relief sewer would relieve the immediate district only at the expense of producing still more serious evils lower down the line of that sewer, and that nothing can be done until the sewerage works of the Metropolis are increased 54 so as to overtake the growth of houses. The first steps in this direction have already been taken by the Council, and plans and estimates for the new sewer required to relieve the lower portions of the Ilolloway and Hackney Storm Relief Sewer have been ordered. FLUSHING CISTERNS. The condition of urinals at public-houses has been brought under notice by the Chief Surveyor who had previously been in communication "with the New River Company with a view to fixing automatic flushing cisterns to secure the proper cleansing and flushing of such urinals This the Company had declined to sanction but had intimated that they would be willing to allow cisterns to be used which were dependent for their action upon the services of an attendant. The Yestry being of opinion that some automatic means of flushing such urinals should be provided, applied to the London County Council, as the Metropolitan Authority under the Metropolis Water Act, 1891, to request the New River Company to make such alterations in their regulations as might be necessary in order that automatic flushing cisterns of such capacity as might be required for the efficient flushing of urinals might no longer be prohibited. It was also suggested that cisterns of a capacity of three gallons should be allowed for the flushing of w.c.'s, the two-gallon cisterns permitted by the New River Company being, in the opinion of the Chief Surveyor, inadequate for the proper flushing and cleansing of the w.c. basins. The Council declined to move in the matter, alleging that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain any alteration of regulations which were settled by the Board of Trade after long enquiry with the several Water Companies and the late Metropolitan Board of Works. They also stated that they had been in communication with the New River Company with a view to arriving at some arrangement whereby automatic flushing cisterns might be allowed ; but they found that the Company were only prepared to permit the use of such cisterns when payment for the water supplied thereto was by meter. 55 DUSTING AND SLOPPING. The following statement shews the nett cost of the collection and disposal of house refuse and road sweepings during the year:— Gross expenditure £27,714 17 5 Credits. Amounts received by the sale of ashes, breeze, sand, horses and carts, and the removal of trade refuse £1,448 15 2 Cartage, smith's and wheelwright's work in repairing tools and water vans in connection with the repair and watering of the roads 2,606 18 5 Cartage and disposal of sludge from sewers and gullies, and repairing tools 551 0 5 Work done in connection with public lamps 0 14 2 4,607 8 2 £23,107 9 3 The cost for the year ended Lady-day, 1891, amounted to £19,411 1s. 3d., or £3,696 8s. Od. less. The increased cost this year is due to an advance in the wages of the dustmen, to the larger quantity of house refuse collected, and to the increase in the cost of disposal of both house refuse and refuse from the roads. The amount paid for freightage and for shoots for house and trade refuse and road sweepings was £6,175 Is. Od., an increase of £2,152 4s. 8d. on the previous year. The contract price for the disposal of mixture and slop was £5 10s. Od. per freight, as against £3 10s. Od., the amount paid during the greater portion of the previous year. The receipts for the sale of ashes and breeze amounted to £262 l1s. l1d., an increase of £6 18s. 1d., and for the sale of sand to £516 13s. 2d., an increase of £74 4s. 4d. over the preceding year. The average cost per load for the collection and disposal of house and trade refuse and road sweepings was 4s. 10½d., as against 3s. ll½d. for the year 1890-91. This increase is chiefly due to the increase in dustmens wages and in the amount paid for freightage, and to the cost of the erection of loose boxes and sheds. 56 48,164 loads of house and trade refuse were removed during the year as against 45,120 loads during the preceding year, an increase of 3,044 loads. In connection with the coming into force of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the work in connection with the removal of house refuse has been re-organised. The Vestry has adopted a scheme providing, for dust carts passing through each road and street every alternate day and householders have been supplied with a "D" card to exhibit when the refuse is required to be removed. The system of paying the slopmen and dustmen according to the number of loads removed has also been abolished and a new arrangement has been made by which the men are paid at the rate of 4s. per day for each day worked, the slopmen being required to cart not less than five loads or to clear the roads allotted to them during the day. In addition they are paid 9d. for each load carted in excess of the five referred to. The quantity of slop and sweepings removed from the roads during the year was 46,538 loads. 18,407 loads of this material and 1,017 loads of sludge from the sewers and gullies were passed through the wash mills, and the sand resulting from this work was sold or used upon the roads. The following quantities were disposed of during the year:— 6,318¼ cubic yards sold £534 0 2 952 „ „ used on the roads 47 12 0 £581 12 2 The number of horses in stock at Lady-day was 88 and 2 cobs. 20 horses were purchased during the year at a cost of £1,415 10s. Od. 17 horses were sold for £107 18s. Od. their average term of work having been 6½ years. The Vestry having obtained from the Guardians a lease of the old workhouse cottages and yard adjoining the present depot in Liverpool Road has erected six new loose boxes on the site of the cottages and a shed on part of the yard. Alterations have also been made in the old workhouse, the ground floor rooms having been converted into a shop where the Yestry's vans and carts can be painted and the upper floors into stores for road materials. The total cost of these works amounted to £1,015 16s. 6d. 57 SUMMARY OF DUSTING FOR 12 MONTHS ENDING MARCH 31ST, 1892. Ward. Collection. Number of Assessments, Lady Day 1692. Where Delivered Loads.

The Metropolitan Public Gardens Association haing obtained possession of the western half of Barnsbury Square, and laid it out at its own expense, it was opened to the public by Her Grace the Duchess of Westminster on 30th April, 1891, and having been handed over to the Vestry it is now being maintained by that body in the same manner as the other open spaces under its control. Newington Green, Islington Green, Canonbury Square Gardens Barnsbury Square Gardens, Thornhill Gardens, Edward Square Gardens, and the enclosures in Caledonian Road and Goswell Road have been maintained as open spaces at the following expense:— Labour and Keepers' Wages £509 15 9 Keepers' Uniforms 33 17 0 Seeds, Plants, Manure, Tools, Repairs, New Garden Seats, New Green Keepers' Lodges and decorations at opening of Barnsbury Square 180 5 11 Water and Rent of Meters 34 19 0 £758 17 8 The band of the Parish Schools played on several afternoons during the summer in Newington Green, Islington Green, Thornhill Gardens, and Barnsbury Square Gardens. The Parish Churchyard is also maintained as an open space by the Churchwardens at the expense of the Vestry under and pursuant to the Open Spaces Acts. CHAPEL-OF-EASE GROUNDS. Nothing of importance has transpired with reference to these grounds. The Churchwardens forwarded the plans of the proposed laying out to the Vicar, but the formal assent to them had not been given during the year with which this report deals. 59 CONTRACTS.

With a view to preventing the re-establishment of the shows which a year or two ago caused considerable annoyance in the High Street and neighbourhood during Cattle Show week, the Vestry, as in the previous year, caused notices to be exhibited in the vicinity cautioning shopkeepers and others against letting their premises for the purpose of holding shows or exhibitions therein, intimating that proceedings would be taken against any person offending. The notices apparently had the desired effect as no further action was necessary. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES. The site of Devonshire House, Hornsey Road, having been obtained, as intimated in the report for last year, for the erection of the northern Baths and Washhouses, the Commissioners in June, 1891, reported to the Yestry that Mr. A. H. Tiltmanhad again, after competition, been chosen as the Architect, and requested and obtained the sanction of the Yestry to a loan of £24,000 for the erection and fitting up of the necessary buildings. The loan having been sanctioned by the Local Government Board, a contract was shortly afterwards entered into with Messrs. Macfarlane Brothers for carrying out the works. These at the termination of the year with which this report deals are well advanced towards completion, and promise to form one of the finest Public Bath and Washhouse establishments in the kingdom. The other establishment (that in the Caledonian Road), will, it is anticipated, be ready for opening in May next. ALTERATIONS TO YESTRY HALL. It was intimated in the last annual report that the General Purposes Committee had brought under the notice of the Vestry the desirability of the Burial Board being requested to vacate its present office on the ground floor in order that better accommodation might be provided for the increased staff of the Works Department, but that the proposal had not met with the approval of the Yestry. The Committee has again brought the necessity for further accommodation under notice and ultimately it was decided to utilize the front 61 room in the basement as an office for the Road Foremen and to adapt the room hitherto used as a store for road tools, plans, books, &c. These works were carried out and the windows in the general offices facing Florence Street were lowered so as to give increased light in the offices, the partitions separating the old Highways and Sewers departments were removed, and other necessary alterations made. The ventilation painting and decorating and the construction of strong rooms which the Vestry resolved, in February, 1891, to carry out, were mainly completed during the vacation of that year. The whole of the work was done by Messrs. Stevens Brothers, of 148, Seven Sisters, Road, at a cost, including the alterations before mentioned, of £1,307 0s. 3d. REGISTRATION OF VOTERS. The revision of the County and Borough and County Council Lists of Voters occupied five days, and took place at the Vestry Hall in September, 1891.

The reduction in the amount of fees received is due to the County Council having made a new arrangement under the Public Health (London) Act which came into operation on the 1st April, 1891. This arrangement was that the use of rooms for the holding of inquests should be paid for by time instead of per case as heretofore. For four hours or less the payment of 7s. only is allowed, and for more than four hours 10s. REGISTRATION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. (29 and 30 Vic., Cap. 30.) There are now 300 houses upon the register. Seven houses in Hercules Place and two in Hornsey Road were demolished during the year, whilst two other houses were taken off the register by resolution of the Vestry upon the application of the owners the houses in question having been let to one family. DISORDERLY HOUSES. One warrant has been obtained against the keeper of a disorderly house with the result that the person charged was fined £20. The fine was paid. The warrant mentioned in the last annual report as remaining unexecuted at Lady Day, 1891, was executed in June, 1891. The magistrate inflicted a fine of £10 or one month's imprisonment. The fine was paid. Observation was kept during the year on sixty houses with regard to which complaints had been received and notices were served on the occupiers of most of these piemises with the result that in nearly every case the houses were vacated without further trouble. Two claims were made upon the Vestry for the informer's fee of £10 in respect of the prosecution and conviction of Jane Turner in June, 1891, for managing the Wellington Coffee House, 18, York Road, as a common brothel. The claims were paid. 63 In connection with this subject, the Vestry received a communication in December, 1890, from the Finsbury Park Vigilance Association calling attention to the position taken up by the Vestry with regard to the prosecution of keepers of disorderly houses and to the action of the Association in suppressing such houses in the parish, and inquiring whether the Vestry would repay to the Association the costs incurred. It may here be noted that on a report from the General Purposes Committee presented in January, 1890, the Vestry had decided to adhere to the provisions of the Act of George II., which requires that two ratepayers shall enter into their recognisances to produce material evidence before proceedings were taken, and further, that as representing the Overseers, it would confine itself to prosecuting in those cases only where complaints have been made by ratepayers as provided by that Act. The General Purposes Committee to whom the letter from the Vigilance Association was referred caused communications to be addressed to overseers of other metropolitan parishes as to the mode of procedure adopted by them, and found that in some parishes the system was similar to that in Islington, while in others the recognisances of two ratepayers were not required the costs of the prosecution being paid out of the general rate. The Vestry accordingly modified its practice so far as to authorise its Committee in any notorious case where a difficulty was found in obtaining two ratepayers willing to enter into their recognisances to proceed without such recognisances, and, if necessary, to charge the expenses of the prosecutions to the general rate. The Vigilance Association was informed in reply to its application that the Vestry had no power to refund any expenses incurred by the Association. The following are the particulars of the prosecutions before mentioned:— Name. Premises. Date of Conviction. Sentence. Jane Turner Wellington Coffee House, 18, York Road 12th June, 1891 Fined £10 or one month (fine paid). George Penfold (alias Watson) 6, Cloudesley Road 30th Oct., 1891 Fined £20 (fine paid). 64 METROPOLIS WATER SUPPLY. The Bill promoted by the Executive Committee of Vestries and District Boards for the purchase of the Water Companies' undertakings, towards the promotion of which this Vestry contributed the sum of £150, did not, unfortunately, meet with the approval of the Select Committee of the House of Commons, to which, as mentioned in the last annual report, it had been referred. It is not necessaiy here to refer to the evidence given before the Committee on behalf of the various bodies interested, but it is a matter much to be regretted, having regard to the importance of a final settlement of the water question being effected without delay, that some understanding should not have been arrived at by which such clauses in the bill as were deemed impracticable might have been amended and the main principle of the bill, viz., that of placing the water supply of London in the hands of some public authority, adopted and passed into law. ALEXANDRA PALACE AND GROUNDS. The question of dealing with this important open space is one which is under consideration by the public bodies interested in securing to the north of London and that part of Middlesex in which the Alexandra Park is situate so valuable and important an acquisition. The initial step towards attaining this object has been taken by the Middlesex County Council, the Vestry having received in December last a communication from the Chairman (Mr. Littler, Q.C.) enclosing particulars of a scheme for the acquisition of the Palace and grounds for the use of the public. The Palace and grounds at present belong to the London Financial Association, who, it will be remembered, have lately been trying to relieve themselves of their statutory inability to sell some 130 out of the 414 acres which constitute the Park. The scheme before mentioned proposed that the whole of the estate of the London Financial Association at Muswell Hill should be purchased, including the Palace and racecourse, glass-house, boating lake, &c., &c., in all about 414 acres, at an estimated cost of £300,000. As regards control it proposes 65 that the estate should be placed in the hands of trustees to consist of persons to be appointed by the City of London, the County Council of Middlesex, the London County Council, and of the Chairmen of the various local bodies in London and of the Local Boards of Health in Middlesex whose districts would be called upon to make special contributions. This scheme was referred by the Vestry to its General Purposes Committee, who reported that the scheme was too crude for the Vestry to express its views thereon but that it felt the park should be retained as a public recreation ground provided it could be secured at a reasonable price. The report of the Committee has been approved and adopted by the Vestry, and a deputation has been appointed to attend any conference that might be held in the matter. In connection with this subject the Vestry also had under consideration in February last a bill promoted by the London Financial Association for authorising the transfer of the Alexandra Palace and Grounds to a public body as trustees of the public. The bill proposed to empower the Association to enter into an agreement with any public body or persons as trustees of the public for the sale of the palace and a part of the grounds for the purpose of public resort and recreation upon such terms as might be agreed, and provided that upon such purchase the Act of 1866, precluding building on a certain portion of the estate, should be repealed. The Vestry, deeming the said bill objectionable, presented a petition against the same. LONDON GOVERNMENT. A conference of members of the Council of the London Municipal Reform League, members of the London County Council, and members of the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, was held at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, in April, 1891, to consider the heads of a draft District Councils Bill. The Vestry appointed Messrs. Bartram, Buckell, Furlong and May to represent it at the conference. Having regard to the intimation of Her Majesty's Government that they intended to introduce a measure for the purpose of forming e 66 District Councils, the Vestry in May, 1891, on the recommendation of its General Purposes Committee, resolved to express its opinion as to the principles upon which such a measure should be framed, and referred it to a special Committee to bring up a report upon the subject. The Committee, while taking note of the heads of a Bill as settled at the above-mentioned Conference, a scheme for District Councils proposed by the London Liberal and Radical Union, and a scheme framed by the Vestry of St. James, Westminster, submitted an independent scheme a copy of which, together with the Committee's report, will be found in the Appendix. This report was adopted by the Vestry; and copies thereof including the scheme were sent to the President of the Local Government Board and to the Home Secretary, to the Members of Parliament representing the Borough of Islington and the various Metropolitan Constituencies, to the Chairman and Members of the London County Council, and to the various Vestries, District Boards, and Rating Authorities of the Metropolis. FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. In May, 1891, the Vestry, as the Local Authority under the Public Libraries Acts, received a requisition signed by a number of ratepayers in the Parish requesting that a vote of the ratepayers might be taken to determine upon the adoption or otherwise by the inhabitants of the above-named Acts with a view to the establishment of Free Libraries in Islington. The Vestry fixed Thursday, the 4th day of June, as the day for the issue of voting papers, and appointed its Vestry Clerk (Mr. W. F. Dewey) Returning Officer. The vote was taken in accordance with the Public Libraries Acts Amendment Act of 1890 by voting papers, the names on the County Council Register forming the electorate for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Acts should be adopted or not. 7,542 persons answered "yes" to the question put to them, and 10,912 answered "no," there being consequently a majority of 3,370 against the adoption of the Acts. There were 1,330 invalid voting papers. The expenses of taking the poll amounted to £211 13s. 5d. 67  North Division. East Division. West Division. South Division Total of Parish. The following is an analysis of the voting:— No. of persons voting "Yes" 2,070 2,313 1,607 1,552 7,542 No. of persons voting "No" 2.933 3,007 2,490 2,482 10,912 No. of invalid voting papers 299 380 304 347 1,330 No. of persen who voted 5,302 5,700 4,401 4,381 19,784 No. of papers undelivered by police or received back through "Dead Letter Office" on account of "Death," "Eemoval," &c. 1,225 935 830 840 3,830 No. of blank papers collected by police 1,605 1,422 613 695 4,335 No. of papers omitted to be returned or returned "Too Late" 1,343 1,265 952 1,053 4,613 No. of persons on the electorate who did not vote 4,173 3,622 2,395 2,588 12,778 Total No. of persons who voted 5,302 5,700 4,401 4,381 19,784 Ditto ditto who did not vote. 4,173 3,622 2,395 2,588 12,778 Total of the electorate 9,475 9.322 6,796 6,969 32,562 68 STREET CLOAK-ROOM ACCOMMODATION. In April, 1891, a communication was received from the Ladies' Sanitary Association, of 22, Berners Street, inquiring whether the provision of Cloak-Room Accommodation in the streets was contemplated in this Parish, and calling attention to the grave suffering caused to women and children through the lack of such sanitary accommodation. The Vestry deemed the subject of sufficient importance to refer this communication to the Works Committee for consideration and report, but no practical decision had been arrived at at the close of the year with which this report deals.

In May, 1891, a communication was received from the Vestry of Clerkenwell calling attention to the recent gifts of pictures and money to the Government for the establishment of a Gallery of British Art and to the proposal that the site of such Gallery should be at South Kensington, and intimating that that Vestry had decided to petition Parliament in favour of the selection of a position more central and accessible. Having regard to the faot that no such Gallery exists in the northern part of the metropolis the Vestry resolved to present a petition to Her Majesty's Government in support of a Gallery being established in North London, and requested the Member for the Borough to support the proposal. A communication was subsequently received from Sir Albert Rollit, M.P., enclosing a letter from Mr. Plunket stating that the selection of a site for the new British Art Gallery to a great extent would depend upon the views of the anonymous donor, who had offered to erect the building at his own expense as well as to contribute a very valuable collection of pictures. Mr. Plunket also intimated that he would bring the Vestry's suggestion under the notice of the proper authorities. POLLING DISTRICTS. During the year the number of Polling Districts for Parliamentary and County Council Elections was increased in three of the Divisions of the Borough, those in the North Division from three to eight, those in the East from three to seven, and those in the West from three to five, the Districts in the South Division remaining the same as heretofore, viz.:—three. 69 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Eayres v. Chisnell. This action against one of the Rate Collectors, particulars of which will be found in the Annual Report for last year, was tried before Mr. Baron Pollock and a Special Jury on June 4th, 1891, with the result that judgment was given for the Defendant with costs, the Plaintiff not having given the statutory notice of action. The Vestry, which had instructed its Solicitor to defend the action, has, however, had to pay the whole of Defendant's costs (amounting to £83 17s. 4d.), it having been found impossible to recover any portion from the Plaintiff, who has, moreover, intimated his intention of appealing against the judgment. The Vestry v. Barratt. A summons was issued at the instance of the Yestry in May, 1891, from the Clerkenwell Police Court, against Mr. G. O. Barratt, a builder, for erecting a shop on the forecourt of 147, Stroud Green Road beyond the general line of buildings without the consent of the London County Council, contrary to the provisions of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862. The building had been decided to be in advance of the general line by the Superintending Architect of the London County Council, against whose decision the Defendant had appealed to the court of experts constituted by the London County Council General Powers Act, 1890. This Court, consisting of three members appointed by the Council of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Council of the Surveyors Institute, and by the London County Council, also decided after considerable delay against the Defendant, but having regard to the fact, which came subsequently to the knowledge of the Vestry, that negociations were in progress to obtain the consent of the Council to the erection of shop-fronts on all the adjacent forecourts, the Vestry subsequently withdrew the summons. Smithers (otherwise Henry) v. The Yestry. In December, 1891, a notice of action was served upon the Yestry at the instance of the Plaintiff in respect of damages alleged to have occurred to his horse and brougham through a subsidence in Poet's Road. The Yestry instructed its Solicitor to defend the action, but the matter had not come into Court up to the end of the year with which this report deals. 70 Warlski v. The Vestry. This case was interesting as being the first summons issued against a Metropolitan Vestry under the Public Health (London) Act for nonremoval of dust after written notice had been given to remove it. The dust was removed pending the return to the summons, and the Plaintiff accordingly withdrew the summons when it came on for hearing before Mr. Haden Corser at the North London Police Court. The law, however, which renders local authorities liable to very heavy penalties for an omission which may be unavoidable and in itself of no serious importance remains, and it is only due to the good sense of the ratepayers as a body that the power vested in them has not been abused. Regina v. Rayson and other Churchwardens. (.Exparte Elliott.) A brief summary is given on page 12 of the facts connected with the abortive election in St. Peter's Ward in May, 1891, and of the subsequent election in December, 1891. The mandamus for the new election was argued before Justices Matthew and A. L. Smith on October 26th, 1891, by Mr. Lumley Smith, Q.C. and Mr. V. Austen on behalf of the Churchwardens and by Mr. McCall for Mr. Elliott. It would have been, of course, useless for the Churchwardens, after the judgment which had been previously given against the Vestrymen who had been declared to be elected in May, to have contended for the validity of that election, and the Vestry's Counsel contented himself with pointing out that although the Court might have jurisdiction, the Yestry under the Metropolis Management Acts could of its own motion only hold an election in May. The Court, being satisfied as to its power to direct a new election, ordered the mandamus to issue and gave costs to Mr. Elliott. Gordon v. Williamson. Although the Yestry was not directly concerned in this case, it was important as being brought against a member of the Yestry, and as affecting the position probably of many Vestrymen not only in Islington but in other Metropolitan Parishes. It was an action by the Plaintiff in the capacity of a common informer for penalties against Defendant for sitting and acting 71 as a Vestryman without being duly qualified, contrary to the provisions of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855 (sec. 54), and was tried before Mr. Justice Denman and a common jury. The Defendant was elected in May, 1890, he being (as he supposed) qualified in respect of premises known as 57a, Ashburton Grove, and described as yard, stable and workshops which were assessed at a rateable value of £125. At the trial it appeared that the Defendant only occupied a portion of the premises himself the other portions being sub-let, but the jury found that the portion so occupied was as a matter of fact of the rateable value of £40. Mr. Justice Denman reserved his judgment upon the point of law which was raised, and on March 19th gave judgment in favor of the Plaintiff to the extent of £250, but declined to grant costs. The learned Judge decided that to qualify a person to act as a Vestryman he must not only be rated to the amount of £40, but that he must beneficially occupy the whole of the premises for which he is rated himself, and intimated that in so deciding he was governed by the dicta of the Master of the Rolls and Lord Justice Lopes in Mogg v. Clark and in R. v. Soutter. Mr. "Williamson's Counsel having intimated his intention to appeal, a stay of execution was granted, so that this point fraught with so much importance to many Vestrymen yet remains undecided.

PARLIAMENTARY. The following Acts (inter alia) passed during the year with which this report deals:— County Councils {Elections) Act, 1891.—An Act to alter the date of holding County Council Elections, and to remove doubts respecting the holding of such elections. 78 Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1891.—An Act which by section 4 amends the provisions contained in sub-section 2 of section 26 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890, with respect to the exemption of certain houses from inhabited house duty, by increasing the amount of such exemption from £20 to £40 annual value. Electoral Disabilities Removal Act, 1891.—An Act which provides that a person shall not be disqualified from being registered by reason only that during part of the qualifying period not exceeding four months at any one time, he has in the performance of any duty arising from his office or employment been absent from his dwelling house or not resided within the required distance from the borough or county. Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation [No. 9) Act, 1891.—An Act confirming, among other orders, the Provisional Order granted by the Board of Trade under the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 and 1888, to the Camberwell and Islington Electric Light and Power Supply, Limited, in respect of the Parish of St. Mary, Islington. Great Northern Railway Act, 1891.—An Act to authorise the Great Northern Railway Company to purchase Nos. 311 and 313, Hollow ay Road. London Overhead Wires Act, 1891.—An Act to provide for the control and regulation of overhead wires in the administrative County of London, and authorising the London County Council to make by-laws and to appoint inspectors for the proper control of such wires. London Sky Signs Act, 1891.—An Act for the prohibition of future and regulation of existing sky signs in the administrative County of London. Registration of Electors Act, 1891.—An Act providing that where a parish is situate in a parliamentary but not in a municipal borough, one half of the expenses and receipts under the Registration Acts, 1843 to 1888, in respect of such parish shall, as from the passing of the County Electors Act, 1888, be defrayed out of and paid to the County Fund. 79 Public Health (London) Act, 1891.—The Public Health (London) Law Consolidation and Amendment Bills which were fully dealt with in the report for the previous year, have become law in a consolidated form under the above heading. The Vestry, upon the recommendation of the Special Comtmitee referred to in the report for 1890-91, petitioned against the Bill, and at the instance of Sir A. Rollit, M.P. for South Islington drafted a series of amendments which were sent to the Metropolitan Members of Parliament, to the Local Authorities of the Metropolis, and to the President of the Local Government Board, upon whom, moreover, they were pressed by the Members representing the Borough. A conference of Metropolitan Local Authorities was subsequently held at the Vestry Hall of St. George, Hanover Square, when these and other amendments were agreed to, and in June, 1891, a very numerous deputation representing almost all the local authorities of the Metropolis waited upon the President of the Local Government Board to protest against the more objectionable clauses of the Bill, and to urge upon him to amend the Bill in the manner suggested by the Vestry of Islington and other Metropolitan Local Authorities. The result of this action was seen when the Bills as consolidated under the above heading became law, and may be gathered from the following extract from the Report of the Special Committee to which the Bill had been referred by the Vestry:— "Your Committee is gratified to find that, although still "a centralizing measure, several important modifications were "made during the passage of the Bill through the House of "Commons, and that these modifications were in the direction "suggested by this Vestry and other Local Authorities of the "Metropolis. Among them may be mentioned the substitution "of the 'Sanitary Authority ' for the ' County Council' as the ''authority to make by-laws for dealing with certain nuisances "which are more particularly under the control of that ''authority; the removal of the responsibility hitherto cast "upon house-holders with regard to the sweeping and cleansing "of the footways and watercourses in front of their premises, "which is devolved under the Act upon the local authority; 80 "the reduction of the fine to which Sanitary Authorities are "to be liable for failing to remove street or house refuse in "accordance with the Act from £50 to £20 ; and the abolition "of the continuing penalty of 5s. per day during non"compliance; and the retention by the Sanitary Authorities "of some control over their own officials." The Act, notwithstanding its penalizing and centralizing tendencies, is, no doubt, a great advance (if considered simply as a consolidation) upon the Acts which have hitherto regulated the action of local authorities in dealing with the health of the inhabitants of the Metropolis. Schools for Science and Art Act, 1891.—An Act to facilitate the transfer of schools for science and art to local authorities. Technical Instruction Act, 1891.—An Act to amend the law relating to Technical Instruction. It provides by section 1 that the Local Authority (London County Council) may make provision in aid of technical or manual instruction, and provide, or assist in providing, scholarships for the same purpose. The following Public Bills also received the attention of the Yestry during the year :— Alexandra Palace and Grounds. Building Law Consolidation and Amendment. Burials. City and South London Railway. County Councils (Elections). General Paving (Metropolis) Act (1817) Amendment. Great Northern and City Railway. Guardians of the Poor Qualification. Hospitals (Assistance from Rates). Lea Valley Drainage. Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Local Authorities (Acquisition of Land). Local Authorities (Purchase of Land). London Building Law (Consolidation). London, Tottenham and Epping Forest Railway. Metropolis Water Supply. National Telephone Company. New Telephone Company {Limited). North Metropolitan Tramways Extension. Old Age Provident Pensions. Public Health London Law Amendment. Public Libraries Law Consolidation. Registration Acts (Lodgers) Amendment. Smoke Nuisance {Metropolis). Street Organs (Metropolis). Streets (Strand Improvement).

MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, At the request of the Public Health Committee, I have undertaken to compile the Annual Report for 1891. In the ordinary course, a report would have been prepared by Dr. C. M. Tidy ; but, unfortunately, his illness and subsequent death rendered this impossible. I do not propose to enter at length into the details of the work performed in the Public Health Department, neither do I intend to criticise the mortality returns, for the simple reason that I was not Medical Officer of Health at the time. CENSUS. The Census of Islington was taken on April 5th, when it was ascertained that the number of houses and inhabitants were as follows 1891. 1881. Houses 38,259 34,046 Inhabitants 319,443 282,865 There has been, therefore, an increase of 4,213 in the number of houses, and 36,578 in the population in the ten years, 1881-91. 6 Table No. I.

From the 1st January to the 31st December, 1891, 720 bodies were received at the Mortuary, the daily average being .19. 407 inquests have been held during the same period, the sum of £39 1s. 6d. having been paid to the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. The proportion of inquests to deaths was 0.9 per cent. for the whole year. The reduction in the amount of fees received during the year is due to the fact that the County Council made a new schedule of fees payable by the Coroner on holding inquests, which came into operation on the 1st of April, 1891. The Council has decided to pay for the use of rooms on the holding of inquests by time instead of per case, as heretofore, e.g., when such room is used for four hours or less, the payment of 7s. only is allowed, and for more than four hours 10s. But as the Coroner seldom sits longer than four hours at a time, and generally twice a week, the amount has not exceeded 14s. per week, hence the reduction in the amount received. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR, 1891-92, Table No. IX. This table of the Sanitary work has been prepared in the usual manner showing in the upper portion the number and variety of the inspections, re-inspections, and calls made by the District Inspectors during the year, and in the lower portion the amendments effected. In addition, the Inspectors generally have reported the premises from which they have found the removal of dust to be necessary on making their ordinary inspections. 21 DISINFECTION. The practice adopted by the Sanitary Committee of carrying out the fumigation of rooms, free of cost, where infectious disease has occurred, continued to be very effectual. The following table gives the number of rooms which have been fumigated by the Disinfect or after cases of infectious disease, during each month of the year. Districts. Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr.

Courts, Lanes, and Street Channels.—Carbolic Acid Disinfecting Powder was applied during the hottest portions of the year to these places, and also to the channels in some of the dirtiest parts of the district. Dust-bins.—These were also disinfected (after emptying by the Dustmen) during the summer, and indeed.- as long as the weather continued warm. 22 Disinfectants Distributed and used.—In the following statement are given particulars of the manner in which the disinfectants were distributed.

This piece of legislation does for the Metropolis what the Public Health Act, 1875, did for the rest of the county. By it a large number of statutes, or parts of statutes, formerly in force in London and relating to public health have been repealed. These are, however, for the most part consolidated in the new Act. One of the most important features in the new statute is the new power it confers on the County Council, which was constituted under the Local Government Act of 1888, to make certain By-laws, which the Sanitary Authorities, the City excepted, must enforce, and to take action if they do not enforce them. Among the principal amendments affected by this Act are:— The Law Relating to Nuisances. „ „ Offensive Trades. „ „ Smoke Consumption, „ „ Workshops and Bakehouses, „ „ Dairies. 23 The Law Relating to Refuse Removal. „ „ Regulations as to Water-closets. &c. „ „ Unsound Food. „ „ Water Supply. „ „Infectious Disease Notification. „ „ „ „ Pretention. „ „ Hospitals and Ambulances. „ „ Prevention of Epidemic Disease. „ „ Mortuaries. „ „ Houses Let in Lodgings. „ „ Tents and Vans. „ „ Underground Rooms. Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1891.—By section 4 the Act of 1890 is amended as follows:— 1. Sub-section 2 of section 26 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890, is hereby amended by the substitution of the words "where the annual value of each dwelling shall not amount to £20 "for the words "for persons at rents not exceeding for each dwelling the rate of 7s. 6d. a week, and occupied only by persons paying such rents." 2. In the case of any house originally built, or adapted by additions or alterations, and used, so far as the same is used as a dwelling house, for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings at an annual value not exceeding forty pounds for each dwelling, the Commissioners acting in the execution of the Acts relating to inhabited house duties shall, upon production of such a certificate as is mentioned in the said sub-section, grant relief by confining the assessment to the annual value of the house exclusive of every dwelling therein of an annual value below twenty pounds (if any) and by reducing the rate of duty to three-pence. 3. The provisions in the said sub-section in relation to a certificate shall apply to a certificate to be produced under this section. 24 SUMMARY OF SUMMONSES. Year ending 25th March, 1892.

At the Annual Licensing in October, 1891, there were 72 applications for the renewal of licenses to Slaughter-houses, 70 of which were granted, and two were refused upon objections being raised by the County Council to the premises. For the renewal of licenses to Cow-houses, 32 applications were made, 31 were granted, and one refused on account of the premises not having been used as a Cow-shed for some years. The annual inspection of these places, prior to the licensing, proved them to he generally in a satisfactory condition. 25 REGISTRATION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS, OR OCCUPIED BY MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. (29 & 30 Vic., cap. 90, s. 35; and 37 & 38 Vic., cap. 89, s. 47.) Of the 311 houses upon the register, 7 in Hercules Place and 2 in Hornsey Road were demolished during the year, whilst one house in Bemerton Street and another in Benwell Road were taken off the register by resolution of the Vestry upon the application of the owners who had let the houses to one family. The remaining 300 houses have been regularly inspected during the year, and the regulations duly enforced. 155 notices were served for non-compliance with the regulations, but in no instance was it found necessary to resort to legal proceedings to enforce them. THE DUSTING OF THE PARISH, 1891-92. I have appended the usual tabulated statement (Table No. X.) of the applications for the removal of Dust during the year ending Lady Day, 1892, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the Parish. Of the total number of 10,838 applications received from residents during the year, 8,013 were by Letter or Post Card, and 2,825 by personal application at the Vestry Offices. The 10,838 applications received from inhabitants were at the rate of 25.6 per cent. of the 42,180 assessments in the Parish, as against 26.9 per cent. in 1890. 26 MATTERS CONSIDERED BY THE SANITARY COMMITTEE. Disinfecting Chamber. The subject, of a suitable site for a disinfecting chamber was considered by the Sanitary Committee, and on January 16th it passed the following resolution:— "That having carefully considered various sites, more or less "suitable for the purpose of erecting a disinfecting chamber, the "Committee is of opinion that a portion of the site in the Hornsey "Road, for which the Baths and Washhouses Commissioners are "in negotiation, is the most suitable, and instruct the Vestry "Clerk to write to the Baths' and Washhouses' Commissioners "as to which portion of the land can be obtained and at what "price the same can bo purchased." Subsequently the Sanitary Committee received a letter from the Commissioners in which the latter body enquired the amount of land that would be required, whereupon the former body passed another resolution to the following effect:— "That the Committee acquire a piece of land about 3,000 "superficial feet for the purpose of erecting the chamber, and that "the Superintendent write to the Commissioners of Baths and "Washhouses in reply to the letter under notice. And also enquire "whether a portion of either the undermentioned sites may be "obtained for the purpose of erecting the proposed Disinfecting "Chamber, viz.:—Technical Institute in Holloway Road and "French's Yard in Liverpool Road." It was also resolved:— "That the piece of land in rear of the mortuary keeper's "house be measured up as to whether it is large enough for the "same purpose." A reply was subsequently received from the Commissioners to the effect that as they did not quite know their own requirements they could not give the Committee a definite answer. 27 The site of the Technical Institute naturally and properly fell through, and the Medical Officer of Health (Dr. Tidy) reported against that at the Mortuary because it was in too close proximity to adjacent buildings, and would entirely block up the air space in rear of the mortuary keeper's house. The proposed site at French's Yard was also not attainable and unsuitable, so that once more the Committee wrote to the Commissioners of Baths and Washhouses about the Hornsey Road Site, and received a reply which further deferred the settlement. Advertisements were also inserted in the papers about the end of June, and three replies were received, but the sites offered were not suitable. Thus, it will be seen that great difficulties were experienced by the Sanitary Committee in their endeavour to procure a site for a disinfecting chamber. Informal Notices to Abate Nuisances. Owing to the fact that costs were allowed to the defendant in the case of a nuisance existing at a house in Ashley Road, a reference from the Yestry caused the Sanitary Committee to enquire into the matter. A report was, therefore, submitted by the Yestry Clerk, who stated that the form of notice which had been served upon the defendant was in accordance with a form that had been in use in the department for a number of years, but he thought to prevent informality in future, all notices prior to being served should receive the approval of the Superintendent. In consequence of this statement, the Committee passed a resolution that in future all notices before being served by the Inspectors should be initialled by the Superintendent (9th March). 28 Mortuary Buildings. The Coroner, through Dr. Wynn Westcott, the Deputy Coroner, presented a report containing the views of the Coroner relative to alterations proposed to be made in the building. It was as follows:— "To the Chairman and Members of the Sanitary Committee. "Gentlemen, "Her Majesty's Coroner for Central London has "requested me to bring before you the following suggestions as to "alterations in the Mortuary Buildings, because he believes they "would tend to the convenience of the public. There are now five "rooms in the building:— "No. 1. Public Mortuary. "No. 2. Infectious Disease. "No. 3. Waiting Boom. "No. 4. Lumber Boom for Coffins, &c. "No. 5. Postmortem Boom." He suggests:— "(a.) That No. 1 should be used, as now, as a mortuary, and "for the view of the Jurymen. "(b.) That No. 2 be arranged as a postmortem room "instead of No. 5, and that a door of communication be made from "Nos. 1 to 2. "(e.) No. 3 remains as a waiting room, but that a women's "w.c. should open out of it behind, instead of out of No. 4; the "coffin room as at present. "(d.) No. 4 may remain as at present, only that the women's "w.c. be closed. "(e.) That No. 5, the farthest off, be kept for the infectious "cases. "All these alterations, as suggested, I do myself believe "would be of public advantage, and could be made at small "expense. "Faithfully Yours, "(Signed) WYNN WESTCOTT, "Deputy Coroner." 29 Plans and specifications were also submitted by the Surveyor, and the Committee resolved that the suggestions contained in the Coroner's letter be carried out. Norfolk Square Area. The insanitary condition of this area was discussed on various occasions by the Sanitary Committee, who for one reason or another wavered as to the course to be pursued in remedying the evils complained of by that locality. At one time it was thought possible to remedy the defects in the different houses, and by this means to place them in a condition fit for human habitation. Some differences of opinion existed among the members of the Committee with respect to the possibility of doing anything with them under the "Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890," and on inspecting the various premises this view was strengthened, for the Committee (16th June) ordered notices to be served on the owners of certain houses to lime-wash and repair the premises, also to repair the water waste preventers, and to provide a more efficient water supply to the closets. These notices were to have been served under the "Nuisance Removal Act." This view was not, however, shared by the London County Council, for at the meeting of the Committee held 5th October, a letter was read from that body stating that "the Housing of the Working Classes Committee "of the Council, having again inspected the area referred to, is of "opinion that nothing short of a scheme for the arrangement and "re-construction of the area under Section 39 (1) (b) of the 'Housing "of the Working Classes Act, 1890' will be an effectual remedy for "the evils within it." This view of the matter on mature consideration met with the support of the Sanitary Committee, and on 19th October, it passed a resolution authorising a scheme to be prepared. This course was undoubtedly the proper one; and it is doubtful if at any time any other scheme would have been entertained if it were not for the cost. On this subject, however, the minds of the Committee were greatly relieved, and their resolve strengthened to do the right thing, by the County Council offering to pay half the expense. Pending the execution of the scheme the Committee succeeded in getting some improvement effected in Concord Buildings so as to make them less objectionable, and more healthy. 30 Finally the Sanitary Committee on the 18th December, drew up an important report to the Vestry,of which the following is a portion: 2. Your Committee is, however, of opinion that the closing of the houses in question will not do away with the necessity for an improvement scheme in connection with the whole of the buildings comprised within the said area, and having regard to the communication from the London County Council, your Committee recommends that the Vestry do resolve:— "(a.) That it appearing to the Vestry as the Local "Authority under Part 2 of the 'Housing of the Working "Classes Act, 1890,' that the closeness, narrowness and had "arrangement or bad condition of the following buildings' " viz.:— "Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, Concord Buildings. "Nos. 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20, Ecclesbourne Road. "Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, Norfolk Court. "Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, Norfolk Square. "Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, Norfolk "Gardens. "Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, Morton Road. "Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 7 and 8, Lindsay Cottages. "and the want of light, air, ventilation and proper con"veniences and other sanitary defects in the said buildings "are dangerous and prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants "of the said buildings and of the neighbouring buildings, and "that the demolition or the reconstruction and rearrangement "of the said buildings or of some of them is necessary to "remedy the said evils, and the area comprising such buildings "and the yards, out-houses and appurtenances thereof, and "the site thereof is too small to be dealt with as an unhealthy "area under Part I. of this Act, a scheme be prepared for the "improvement of the said area under and pursuant to the "provisions of Part II. of the said Act." And this was the position this important matter was left in at the end of the year when the Sanitary Committee ceased to exist, and when the newly constituted Public Health Committee came on the scene. 31 Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890. In a report by the late Medical Officer of Health presented to the Committee on May 11th, he stated that 10 applications for certificate3 under the Act had been applied for, and that the work of examining the houses had entailed an enormous amount of labour both on himself and on the staff of the department. From this report it appeared that no leas than 997 tenements had been inspected, and that every detail in connection with the inspections had been recorded in a book which he produced. It was gratifying to learn that a great many improvements had been effected in the several dwellings. The working of the Act had entailed, in addition to the work thrown on the Medical Officer, the Superintendent and the several Inspectors, a large amount of correspondence and numerous interviews with the owners or their representatives, before the necessary requirements of the chief official had been carried out. Subjoined will be found a list of the dwellings which were examined, showing whether certificates were granted or withheld. Date of Inspection. Situation of Premises. Number of Dwellings.

IV "THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875." Report of the Public Analyst appointed for the Parish of St. Mary, Islington, upon the Articles Analysed by him under the above Act during the Quarter ending the 31 st December, 1891. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, During the last quarter I have analysed 96 samples of Food and Drugs submitted to me by your Inspectors. No samples were submitted to me by private purchasers. Of the above samples 2 were adulterated, a Vinegar and a Milk. The percentage of adulteration has become so low in this Parish that the question of purchasing the samples by an agent will have to be considered, the application of the Margarine Act is also another question which will have to be faced. In another Metropolitan Parish where I am Analyst, and where purchases are made by the Inspectors through an agent, and where moreover the Margarine Act is very rigorously carried out, the percentage of adulteration has varied between 20 and 33 per cent, during the last 2 years.

By order, WM. F. DEWEY, Vestry Clerk. london : cha8. straker and sons, "avenue works," bishopsgate avenue, e.g. 1891. VESTRY OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON. Estimates for Rates. POOR HATE. The amount required to be raised for the half-year ending 30th September next is £112,220, equivalent to a rate of 1s. 5d. in the £. Compared with the Rate for the corresponding period of last year, this is a reduction of ½d. in the £, but is an advance on the current Rate, made in August last, of ¾d. in the £,—accounted for by an increase of £6,640 in the amount of the Board of Guardians' Contribution Order. . No estimate has been obtained of the requirements of the London County Council. The amount actually contributed to that body for the corresponding period of last year, has accordingly been taken as the basis of this half-year's estimate. LIGHTING RATE. The amount necessary to provide the expenses of Public Lighting for the forthcoming half-year is £5,922, a reduction of £1,348 on the amount to be raised by the current Rate. In making a Rate of l¼d. in the £ in August last, it was estimated that there would be a surplus at the end of the half-year, and upon reference to the account of the Lighting Rate on Page 6, it will be seen that a balance of £1,195 has been carried forward to the credit of the next Rate. It will now be necessary to make a Rate of 1d. in the £, or ¼d. in the £ less than the current Rate. GENERAL RATE. The sum required for the purposes of the General Rate for the half-year ending Michaelmas next is £78,520. Of this amount, £38,200, or very nearly one-half, is required to meet the demands of the School Board for London. A Rate of ll¾d. in the £ (which was also the Rate levied for the corresponding period of last year) is estimated to produce £77,608, and will leave a deficiency of about £900 at the end of the half-year. SEWERS RATE. It is estimated that a sum of £2,206 will be required to defray the expenses connected with the Sewerage of the Parish during the next half-year. To mr-et this a rate of ¼d. in the £ will be required, which will necessitate the carrying forward of a Dr. Balance of about £550. It will be seen from the foregoing, that the total amount required to be raised during the half-year ending Michaelmas next, for all purposes is £198,768 to meet which it will be necessary to levy Rates amounting altogether to 2s. 6d. in 1he £, namely :— Poor Rate 1s. 5d. Lighting Rate 1d. General Rate ll¾d. Sewers Rate 0¼d. 2s. 6d. 3 As before stated if the Hates are made at these figures there will probably be a deficit on the General and Sewers Rates amounting in all to about £1,450. There is, however, a set.off against this in the probable surplus on the Poor and Lighting Rates of £748, so that in the whole it is not likely that there will be a greater deficit than £700 at the close of the half.year. In calculating the Rates in the £ required, the present Rateable value of the Parish, namely, £1,669,556 has been taken as the basis. The Rateable value according to the new Quinquennial Valuation List which comes into force on the 6th April next, is £1,686,235 (an increase of £16,679 only); but in view of the important appeals which are now pending before the Court of Quarter Sessions, it, would not be advisable to rely upon the new value. The production of 1d. Rate has accordingly been estimated at £6,605, being a slight increase upon that for the Quarter ending Christmas last. The subjoined statement shews the proportions of the: Rate under the various heads of expenditure, also the amount required for Vestry purposes and that for expenditure over which the Vestry has no control. It should be observed that out of a Rate of 2s. 6d. in the £, less than 7£d. of that sum only is actually disbursed by the Vestry. The figures for the two previous half.years are given for purposes of comparison. Half.year ending Michaelmas, 1691. Half.year ending Lady.day, 1891. Half.year ending Michaelmas, 1890.

By order, WM. F. DEWEY, Vestry Clerk. LONDON: HAS. STRAKER AND SONS, "AVENUE WORKS," BISHOPSGATE AVENUE,' E.C, 1891 VESTRY OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON. Estimates for Rates. Before proceeding to deal with the various Rates in detail, it is desirable to draw the attention of the Vestry to the Assessment upon which these Rates must be based. The rateable value of the Parish, according to the Quinquennial Valuation List, which came into force on the 6th April last, was £1,686,285 The Vestry will remember that in making the Rates last February it was considered, in view of the important appeals to Assessment Sessions which were then pending, that it was not advisable to rely upon the new Assessment, and the Rates were accordingly made upon the Rateable Value as it stood at the close of the Lady Day Quarter, when the nett amount produced by a Penny Rate was £6,605. The appeals above referred to have not yet been heard, and the parties concerned have paid the last Quarter's Kates on their increased Assessments. The consequence of this has been that the Rate has yielded a larger sum than was anticipated, but it must bo borne in mind that in the event of these appeals being sustained, the Rates which will then have been paid in excess must be returned. In the Estimates now to be dealt with, a sum is provided to meet this contingency. A Rate of a penny in the £, alter allowing for empties and losses (about 4.80 per cent.) is estimated to produce £6,644. 3 POOR RATE. It is satisfactory to note that there is a reduction in the amount required for the Poor Rate for the ensuing half-year to 31st March next. This is occasioned mainly by the fact that the sum included in this estimate for the requirements of the London County Council, namely, £41,281 is less by £4,422 than that for the last half-year. It must not be overlooked, however, that this is, after all, only an estimate. No particulars have yet been furnished by the Council, and the only basis that can be taken is the amount actually required by that Board during the current half-year. There is, in addition to the above, a sum of £1,000 which has been contributed by the Burial Board, and £2,009 received for Rates in excess of the amount originally estimated. It should also be here noted that there has been a saving of £4,422 on the estimate for the County Council's requirements in the present half-year, but this is absorbed in additional expenditure by the Board of Guardians which was not contemplated at the time the last estimates were framed. The total amount now proposed to be raised for the half-year to 31st March next is £101,846, which will necessitate a rate of Is. 3^d. in the £. This is a reduction upon the current rate of l½d. in the £. LIGHTING RATE. £6,141 is required to meet the expenses of Public Lighting for the forthcoming half-year. This is equivalent to a Rate of 1d. in the £. GENERAL RATE. It will be seen on reference to page 21 that the next rate is charged with a probable deficit at the end of this half-year of £3,305, equivalent to a rate of ½d. in the £. It was anticipated at the time of making the last Rate that there would be a deficit at the 30th Saptembar next of 4 £912 (vide last Estimates, page 2), but there is now to be added to this the sums by which the actual expenditure will exceed the original estimates, namely:— £ Highways 340 Horse & Depôt 550 Sanitary 148 School Board 81 Churchwardens 240 Loans and Interest 4 Valuation and Assessment 2,383 3,746 Deficit, as above 912 Deduct gain in actual Receipts over estimated Receipts 4,658 1,353 £3,305 The amount necessary to be raised for the General Rate, for the half-year ending 31st March, 1892, is £86,348, to meet which a Kate of 1s. 1d. in the £ will be required, an increase of a penny in the £ upon the Rate for the corresponding period of last year. Of this sum the School Board takes £38,562, or rather more than 5¾d. in the £. This is less than for the corresponding half of last year, owing to the increased assessment upon which the Rate is levied. SEWERS RATE. A Rate of ½d. in the £ will be required to defray the expenses connected with the Sewerage of the Parish for the six months ending 31st March, 1892. This is the same as for the corresponding period of last year. 5 From the preceding statements it will be seen that the total of the Rates necessary to be raised for the half-year ending 31st March next, is 2/0 in the £. The statement below shews that out of this Rate, only 9d. in the £ is to cover expenditure actually under the control of the Vestry. ARTHUR TOWERS, Accountant to the Vestry.

DISTRICT COUNCILS. Report of the Special Committee, appointed by the Vestry of St. Mary, Islington, on May 16th, 1891, to bring up a Report on such schemes relating to District Councils as may be already before the public, and to make such recommendations in the matter as they may deem expedient. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Your Committee, in accordance with the terms of reference, have considered the Heads of a Draft District Councils' Bill which were settled at a conference between Members of the Council of The London Municipal Reform League, Members of the London County Council, and Members of the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, at which delegates from the Vestry of St. Mary, Islington, were present; also a scheme for District Councils, proposed by The London Liberal and Radical Union; and a scheme framed by the Vestry of St. James, Westminster. All these documents contain suggestions of a valuable character, but your Committee have, instead of dealing with them separately, deemed it better to prepare an independent scheme embodying such of them as they approve, together with others which they consider should be included in any legislation that may take place upon the subject. ( 2 ) This scheme will be found as an appendix to this report, and although most of the suggestions contained therein speak sufficiently for themselves, it may be well to indicate some of the principles which have guided your Committee in framing it. In the first place, it seemed to your Committee that they were not called upon to draw up a District Councils' Bill, but simply to make recommendations which should guide opinion in the framing of such a measure so far as the Metropolis is concerned. In the second place, while the experience which your Committee have acquired in administering the affairs of a parish like Islington has predisposed them in favour of large areas and extensive jurisdiction, they have not thought it desirable to express an opinion on the varying details of administration which necessarily exist in connection with other parishes, but have felt that it would be better to prepare a scheme suitable for the Parish of Islington on the assumption that it will form one District, leaving it to those who draft the Bill to adopt such portions of it as may be deemed applicable to the requirements of the Districts which may be created. Again, your Committee have felt that the District Council, when appointed, should be entrusted with as much of what is comprised within the term "Local Government" as, having regard to other and possibly conflicting interests and to its capacity for the work, it is prudent 1o confer upon it; that the inhabitants of the district should be fully and adequately represented on the Council; and that to such inhabitants should be secured frequent opportunities of expressing their opinions upon the action of their representatives. Another principle which has guided your Committee is that, having regard to the special work for which the new Council is designed, it should not retain any portion of the semi-ecclesiastical business which was transferred to the Vestry by the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the amending Acts. The election of Churchwardens is therefore ( 3 ) not included in the duties to be conferred on the District Council, neither is it proposed that the Vicar or Churchwardens should be ex officio members of such Council. In framing their scheme your Committee have taken into consideration the powers and duties at present vested in County Councils, in Municipal Corporations and in the existing Vestries and District Boards, in order to see how far the District Council should be clothed with like powers. Your Committee recognise the fact that in London it would be impossible to give to a District Council all such powers as are, for instance, vested in the Corporations of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, and other large provincial cities. Some of these must in London be exercised by a central authority, such as the County Council, which is in a position to carry out enterprises that a District Council could not hope to undertake and to enforce measures designed to benefit the whole Metropolis and not particular localities. At the same time, your Committee are of opinion that where it is possible to carry out any matters of local administration without interfering with the interests of those residing in other districts, it is a sound principle to insist on such administration being exercised by the persons living in each district or by their duly authorised representatives. Your Committee, in making their recommendations, have been guided solely by a desire to make local government in London as effective for its purpose and as little liable to friction as in the nature of the case it can be. Before concluding, your Committee would acknowledge the assistance they have derived from your Yestry Clerk, whose large experience has materially aided them in their consideration of the subjects brought under discussion. Your Accountant too has aided the Committee with some valuable suggestions. Having indicated the principles upon which they have proceeded, (4) your Committee now beg to submit the scheme set out in the Appendix hereto, and to recommend— (a) That the scheme be approved and adopted by the Vestry. (b) That copies of this report and of the scheme be sent to the President of the Local Government Board and to the Home Secretary, to the Members of Parliament representing the Borough of Islington and the various Metropolitan Constituencies, to the Chairman and Members of the London County Council, and to the various Vestries, District Boards, and Rating Authorities of the Metropolis. (e) That this Committee be empowered from time to time to consider, and if necessary to report on any further schemes or communications relating to this subject, and in particular to report on any Bill which may be introduced into Parliament thereon. All which is submitted. RICHARD BARTRAM, Chairman. ( 5 ) APPENDIX. SCHEME. AREA. 1. That the Parish of Islington should form one District Council area. 2. That such area be divided into 12 Wards, corresponding as nearly as may be to the Parliamentary Polling Districts as they stood at the end of November, 1891, with the exception of the Lower Holloway Polling District, which should be divided into two by a line running down the centre of the Caledonian and Camden Roads.
