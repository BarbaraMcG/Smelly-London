To the Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Hornsey. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, This, my Annual Report for the year 1964 must be brief and incomplete owing to the necessity to publish it before the 31st March, 1965, on which date the Borough of Hornsey ceases to exist as an administrative unit of local government by merger into the Greater London Borough of Haringey. Omission of certain statistics and commentary arises from the fact that the Registrar General's figures for 1964 will not have been received within the lifetime of the Borough, Also excluded is an account of local administration of personal and school health services: made impracticable due to time factor and pressure by all concerned in preparatory work of merger into the new Borough. Looking back over 15 years, and more, I have been privileged to serve this Borough as Medical Officer of Health, I recall most vividly the excellent team spirit between members and staff in their joint effort to promote and maintain the health of the public in Hornsey. I am, Your Obedient Servant, G. HAMILTON HOGBEN, Medical Officer of Health. March, 1965.

The area consisted of the following houses:- 1-17 (odd) and 2-14 (even) Osborne Grove At the recommendation of the Housing Committee a Compulsory Purchase Order was made on 25th November, 1964, on all the above houses except Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 & 17 which were already owned by the Council, together with the sites of Nos. 16-18. Only one objection was received but as this was later withdrawn no public inquiry was required.

RE-HOUSING ON HEALTH GROUNDS During the year ten families unable to attract a sufficient total of points were put forward to the Committee as in need of special consideration. The Committee approved six and five were rehoused before the end of the year. The total number of new housing cases reviewed on health grounds during the year was 133. In 123 cases action was as follows:- Nil points recommended 20 5 „ „ 7 10 " " 11 15 " " 85 The remaining 10 cases required no further action as for various reasons the applications were withdrawn or not substantiated. Nine cases were recommended for rehousing outside the points scheme of which six were approved by the Committee. Twenty-four families, including 3 specials, with medical points were rehoused during the year. LICENSING OF PET SHOPS During the year 18 inspections were carried out, 8 by the Veterinary Inspector and 10 by the Public Health Inspectors. Six existing licences were renewed at the beginning of the year and 1 new licence issued. HAIRDRESSERS Thirty-seven premises are exclusively used for ladies' hairdressing, twenty for men and six cater for both sexes. All the establishments were inspected during the year and with the exception of a few minor matters were found to comply with the byelaws which are designed to secure the cleanliness of the premises, the staff, instruments and equipment used. 11. IMPROVEMENT OF HOUSES During the first half of the year 210 houses in the Wightman Road and 116 houses in the Uplands Road area were inspected to ascertain their suitability for improvement with the aid of standard and discretionary improvement grants. It was found that whilst a number of houses could be provided with basic amenities with the aid of standard grants, many would require major structural work in order to benefit from discretionary grants and a number would need a reduction in the number of families occupying the dwellings. The majority of the houses most suitable for improvement were in Uplands Road. Action was taken following the receipt of these reports, to publicise the methods of obtaining grants. The information obtained from the survey will be of value in future consideration of policy regarding improvement areas. HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION Since before the 1961 Act the work of inspecting houses in multiple occupation has been progressing and during this last year the Council authorised the appointment of additional public health inspectors to increase the rate of inspection. Having dealt with those concerning which complaints or information is received in the department, it has now been possible to commence the house-to-house inspection of houses in multiple occupation in the Finsbury Park and Stroud Green areas of the Borough. The concentration of this type of premises is such that within many roads every house is found to be occupied by more than one family. The standard amenities as prescribed by the Council under Section 15 of the Housing Act, 1961 are required to be provided by the person having control of the premises and in certain cases the Council has carried out necessary work in default, either by direct labour or by instructing a suitable builder. The Housing Act, 1964 was welcomed for its extension of the provisions of the 1961 Act, in particular for the introduction of the penalty clause for failure to carry out works to comply with a notice under Section 15 of the 1961 Act. Builders are sometimes reluctant to undertake work in houses in multiple occupation as working conditions within these houses are not attractive and building operatives prefer to work in houses where the occupation is not so concentrated. Registration At the end of the year the Council approved a scheme of registration of houses in multiple occupation in the Finsbury Park and Stroud Green areas of the Borough. The scheme was submitted to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. 12. OFFICES, SHOPS & RAILWAY PREMISES ACT, 1963 Registration of premises under this Act commenced on 1st May and should have been completed by 31st July. From 1st August the principal health, safety and welfare sections became operative. With the exception of certain special classes, all shops and office premises within the Borough will require to be inspected and registered and regard must be had to each of the following matters:- 1. Cleanliness 9. Accommodation for clothing 2. Overcrowding 10. Sitting facilities and seats for 3. Temperature sedentary work 4. Ventilation 11. Eating facilities 5. Lighting 12. Floors, passages and stairs 6. Sanitary Conveniences 13. The safety and operation of 7. Washing Facilities machinery 8. Drinking Water 14. Noise and vibration 15. First aid. At the end of the year only 579 premises had been registered and it is thought that this figure is considerably below the number of premises which will be subject to the new Act. Estimates are extremely difficult to make, particularly as offices have not previously been registered and premises which are run as "family concerns" are not subject to registration. This rules out many of the smaller shops in the Borough. The Medical Officer of Health and his deputy and all the public health inspectors were authorised as inspectors under the Act and inspection of premises commenced in the autumn. By the end of the year 30 premises had received a general inspection. Having regard to the many other responsibilities of the inspectors it is inevitable that some time will elapse before all registered premises have received a complete general inspection. WATER SUPPLY The water supply for Hornsey continues to be satisfactory both in quality and quantity. All except a very small part of the Borough is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, whose officers are continually sampling for both chemical and bacteriological examination. The extremely high standards set by the Board have been maintained through the year. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL That part of the Borough north of Fortis Green is drained into the East Middlesex main drainage system and the remainder of the Borough's sewerage system joins the northern outfalls of the London County Council's drainage system. The whole of the Borough is thus adequately served. 13.

RODENT CONTROL Rodent baiting at the sewer access points to secure the reduction or elimination of rats was continued during the year with treatments at four monthly intervals at approximately half of the accessible places. Two treatments with sodium fluoroacetate were followed by one with Warfarin and it was found that the rodent population in the sewage system has been so reduced that "takes" occur at less than 5% of the baiting points. Endeavours are being made to trace old unused sewers, the positions of which are not clearly defined on available maps and records. Some further reduction in the rodent population might be expected when these old pipes are found and treated. Full extermination, however, appears to be unlikely unless the treatment programmes of all adjoining local authorities can be fully synchronized. The control of mice is now undertaken at a nominal charge of 2s.6d. per domestic building and a large proportion of the rodent operator's time is now spent on this work. The evidence available suggests that house infestations by mice are being kept within reasonable limits. Comparative figures relating to surface infestations for 1963 and 1964 are as follows: 1963 1964 January - March 35 58 April - June 40 56 July - September 29 67 October - December 43 66 147 247 15. CLEAN AIR The sixth Smoke Control Order came into force on 1st December, 1964 and thus by the end of the year almost two-thirds of the area of Hornsey was subject to smoke control. The remaining four areas to complete the whole of the Borough should, according to the present programme, be dealt with by the end of 1968. Inspection of properties in the seventh area was carried out during the year and the Order made in March, 1965. This Order, it is expected, will be in force on 1st December, 1965. The area is in the eastern half of the Borough and lies principally to the north of Weston Park, east of Park Road, south of Priory Road and High Street, Hornsey and west of Wightman Road. In December, 1964 the Ministry of Housing and Local Government issued circular No.60 which discussed the payment of grants in smoke control areas in relation to the installation of direct acting electric space heaters. This is because of the shortage of electric fuel at peak periods. Grant Will continue to be paid on the installation of thermal storage heaters which use off peak electricity. Additional Assistance Additional financial assistance is given to old age pensioners and others who lack the means to pay the balance after seven-tenths of the cost of conversions has been paid by the Council. 79 cases were dealt with and the total sum granted (in addition to the statutory grant) was £664.17s.11d. 16. Food The inspection of food and of premises used for the storage, preparation and sale of food for human consumption has progressed steadily during the year. There are still considerably diverse opinions as to whether the public interest would be served by the marking of wrapped foodstuff with a date or mark which was intelligible to the ordinary consumer. Whilst it would appear to be an immediate advantage for the consumer to be able to read on the package some date after which the food should be considered as not in a fully fresh condition, no system of date marking can give full regard to the wide differences in the condition of the food which can arise from varying methods of storage and the care taken in storage and handling. Criticism of the proposal to mark food wrappers with the date also arises from an apprehension that the public would examine the wrapping, particularly in self-service shops, and demand the most recently packed article. This practice, it is said, might lead to an increase in wastage of the foodstuff and thence lead to increased prices. Perhaps some compromise could be found in this matter if manufacturers and packers were prepared to advise retailers on the interpretation of the code marks which appear on most wrapped food. This recommendation to shopkeepers that they should themselves mark all wrapped foods received, is found by many small shopkeepers to be impracticable with the limited staff and facilities available during the busiest shopping periods. The dirty milk bottle still gives cause for concern. It is appreciated that the condition of an unclean milk bottle arises in most cases from misuse by members of the public, but so long as the milk bottling companies continue to operate the re-usable container system the onus must remain with them to ensure that the container is absolutely clean and fully fit for use for the reception of food intended for human consumption. Some progress has been made in the Borough in this regard in that more and more non-returnable containers are being used for the distribution of milk both to the schools and to the public generally. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF FOOD The sampling of cooked meats has been continued at regular intervals from grocers and butchers' shops. A total of 50 samples was submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale for bacteriological examination. Half of these were described as 'satisfactory', 'fairly satisfactory' or 'within normal limits'. Of the remaining 25, 21 were 'not satisfactory' while 4 were 'not entirely satisfactory'. Although no pathogenic organisms which could be directly responsible for food poisoning were isolated, these results show unsatisfactory handling or storage of food and thus leave room for improvement. Whenever an unsatisfactory result is received the public health inspector carries out a.careful check on the storage and handling processes and makes recommendations which should result in much improved hygiene. 17.

REGISTRATION OF HAWKERS OF FOOD AND THEIR STORAGE PREMISES REGISTRATION OF PREMISES FOR THE SALE ETC. OF ICE CREAM During the year one application was received for the registration of premises for the storage and sale of ice cream and one for the sale of ice cream only. In both instances the premises were satisfactory in the terms of the Food Hygiene Regulations and accordingly the Council agreed to their registration. REGISTRATION OF DISTRIBUTORS OF MILK Four applications were received for the registration of premises for the sale of milk. In all cases conditions were considered satisfactory in the light of Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations and the registrations were granted. During the year one new registration was effected under Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 19501 and at the end of the year there was in the Borough one registered storage premises used by a hawker from another Borough and 52 registered hawkers who are at present selling the following foods:- Confectionery 1 Groceries 1 Eggs 2 Ice cream 17 Fish 1 Winkles and shrimps 1 Fruit and vegetables 28 Fish and chips and pickles 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Date of hearing Offence Result Milk & Dairies (General) Regulations 1959 Para.27 10th mrch Iron filings and carbon in milk Fine £5 Costs £7.7s.Od.

GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF STAFF Sixty-seven persons were medically examined to determine their fitness for acceptance on the permanent staff; all but six were found to be fit. One of the conditions of the scheme for sickness pay for employees who come within the scope of the National and Provincial Councils for Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers) is that all new employees be required to submit to a medical examination before the completion of six months' service with the Council in order to determine their fitness for admission to the scheme. 100 persons were examined, 99 of whom were accepted for the scheme. 2 examinations were carried out for other purposes. MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Part XII of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944, which was brought into operation in Hornsey on 1st October, 1952 provides that premises in the Borough used for the reception or treatment of persons requiring massage or special treatment must be licensed. The Act gives the Council power to inspect licensed premises, and these inspections are carried out by the deputy medical officer of health. No reason for complaint has been found during inspections carried out in the year and generally speaking the standard maintained is good. Licences were issued in respect of 15 premises. The following summary shows the numbers licensed for each form of treatment. Massage 2 Chiropody 15 Electrical treatment 2 Other similar treatment 2 One exemption certificate was received from a registered member of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy. Such certificate in an approved form signed by two registered medical practitioners exempts members from the need to obtain a licence but their premises are nevertheless subject to inspection. PETROLEUM SPIRIT The number of establishments licensed for storage is 61 and the number of licences issued is as follows:- Petroleum 47 Petroleum mixtures 20 Hydro-carbon 2 Napthaline 1 70 (Nine establishments are licensed for more than one product). From 1st April, 1965 all work in connection with petroleum licensing will be transferred to the Greater London Council. 21. DISEASES OF ANIMALS F. G. Buxton, Esq., M.E.C.V.S., the Council's VeterinaryInspector, has supplied information on his work during the past year. Mr. Buxton has completed over 40 years as part-time Veterinary Inspector to this Council and over the years has seen many local changes. At one time he was responsible for inspecting farms, riding establishments and dairy cows kept locally for the sale of milk. Now no cows are kept in the Borough and the last of the riding establishments closed a few years ago. Veterinary inspection in Hornsey is now limited to the inspection of pet shops and the occasional professional consultation, outbreaks of fowl pest or such rare diseases as psittacosis. Details of the work during the past year are as follows:- Eight inspections were made under the Pet Animals Act, 1951. There were no outbreaks of Fowl Pest. Two inspections were made of a flock of racing pigeons which were suspected of infecting their owner with ornithosis. The pigeons were found to be in good condition and fortunately it was later confirmed that ornithosis was not present. No action was necessary under the Tuberculosis Order of 1925. Eighteen certificates were issued for animals and birds going abroad and blood tests taken in three cases as authorised by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food. BURIAL OF THE DEAD Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it is the responsibility of the Borough Council to arrange the burial or cremation of all persons who die in the Borough for whom no suitable arrangements would otherwise be made. Arrangements were made for the burial of six bodies, males of 3, 5^ and 73 years, and females of 82, 84 and 89 years. PUBLIC MORTUARY As reported last year, the new building in Myddelton Road is in use. The working conditions in the new building, a model of its kind, provide ideal conditions for the reception and accommodation of bodies and for the pathologist to carry out his examination as well as for other doctors who may wish to be present. During the year 116 bodies were admitted for post mortem examination and inquests held on 9 of them. It was hoped that the accommodation on the first floor would be brought into use as a Coroner's Court late in 1964 or early 1965, but this has not proved possible owing to delays in obtaining necessary furniture. 22. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 s.47 In no case was it necessary to require the compulsory removal of an old person to a home or hospital. As is usual many persons were referred to the department as being in need of care and attention and 29 such peapel were brought to our notice for the first time during the year or were dealt with without recourse to compulsion. In the overwhelming majority of cases by the provision of statutory and voluntary aids such as the home nurse, home help and various services provided by the Old People's Welfare Council. In a few cases admission to hospital was arranged after some persuasion of the person concerned. 23. STAFF BOROUGH HEALTH DEPARTMENT Medical Officer of Health G. HAMILTON HOGBEN, M.R.C.S., D.P.H.
