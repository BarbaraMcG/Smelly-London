The works undertaken during the year for extending and giving efficiency to the sewerage of the Hamlet, and for paving and improving the streets, will be found in detail in the Report of the Surveyor to the Vestry, which is submitted herewith for the information of the Ratepayers. So far as they include new works, they will, it is trusted, be accepted as a satisfactory instalment of the public improvements which the inhabitants have a right to expect from the Governing Body of the District, and so far as they relate to the maintenance of existing works, it is hoped that they show a due regard to the public health and convenience. The Vestry have not been unmindful of the demands made upon them as the Sanitary Authority. The following is a list of the minor works, which, acting in that capacity, they have caused to be effectually carried out:— Old drains abolished 109 Houses and premises connected with sewers 130 Foul drains cleansed 96 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 22 Traps provided for drains, closets, &c 843 Houses cleansed and purified 147 Dust bins provided 90 Premises from which pigs were removed 16 Houses visited where disease has occurred; and notices left, re contagious diseases 542 Water-waste preventers provided 3 8 The usual periodical visits have been made to cowhouses, slaughter-houses, and bake-houses, and in all of them the observance of sanitary precautions has been enforced. At the Licensing Court, held in October last, the occupiers of 40 slaughter-houses and 38 cow-houses received licenses from the Justices, and, in every case, the decision was in accordance with the views of the Sanitary Committee, based on the survey of the premises or the Reports of the Officers of Health. In the course of the year an important legislative measure, entitled "The Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Act, 1868," came into operation. It confers upon the local authorities very great powers for the compulsory improvement of houses inhabited by the more helpless classes, or, in case of need, their demolition. Such powers require to be wielded with great caution and forbearance, but without losing sight of the object the Legislature had in view. In the only case in which, during the year, the Vestry received from the Medical Officer of Health the formal report, which is necessary to set the law in motion, they were enabled, by the ready compliance of the owner of the premises complained of with their requirements, to secure the due enforcement of the law, without stretching their powers to the utmost, or acting with harshness. The Vestry will not shrink from administering a law which, although at first sight it may appear to be an invasion of the rights of property, is founded upon a due consideration for the health and comfort of the poor; but they hope, in every case, to temper the exercise of authority with discretion and conciliation. The Accounts for the year ending 25th March, 1869, were, at the appointed time, submitted to the Auditors, duly vouched, and allowed, and an abstract of them is appended to this Report. 9 The sum of £1000, which remained due on Mr. Buxton's Loan, contracted for paying works, was paid in February last, and completed the liquidation of the Mortgage for £5000, granted in February 1858.

REGINALD MILLS, ROBERT JAMES TUCKER, REPORT of THE SURVEYOR to THE VESTRY of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. REPORT June, 1869. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in laying before you a statement of the works carried out under the superintendence of my department, during the year ending March 25th, 1869, and in doing so permit me to express my thanks for the unanimous support I have recently received at your hands, and to a hope that my endeavours to faithfully perform the duties of my office will meet with your approval. Paving. Daring the year 11,648 ft. superficial of 3-in. paving have been laid in Burdett-road, and 15,506 ft. superficial of 2½-in. paving in Esmond-road, Coborn-road, St. Dunstan's-road, and St. Ann's-road. This work was performed under contract with Messrs. Booth & Griffith, in a satisfactory manner, and cost the sum of £1017 3s. 10d. In addition to this 10,000 ft. superficial of 2½-in. paving have been purchased under contract from Mr. White, and laid in various parts of the Hamlet by your own masons. One hundred and fifty tons of 4-in. pitching have been bought for the purpose of paving crossings in various parts. 4 New Streets. During the year you have paved, made up, and taken under your charge Latimer-street, Diggon-street, Oley-place, Tillotson-street, Baggallay-street, and St. Dunstan's-road, being an addition of 2290 ft. lineal or 91600 ft. super to the roads of the District. The work in these streets has been performed at the cost of the owners of property. Turner's-road, Woolmore-street, Rowsell-street, Robert-street, Edward-street, and Hall-street, have been made up and paved by the Trustees of the Cotton Estate, and taken under your charge as Public Highways. These roads have a superficial area of 158300 ft., equal 3950 ft. lineal, making a total quantity of 6240 ft. lineal of new roads added to the roads of the Hamlet during the year. The following Tabular Statements will shew the cost of materials and labour for the past three years. ROAD MATERIALS. Year ending March, 1867. Year ending March, 1868.

The arrangement which I was enabled to make last spring with the Great Eastern Railway Company, for taking the slop and refuse, carted from the roads of our Hamlet, has been most advantageous. The Company have taken our slop for nearly the whole of the year, and have been enabled to dispose of it readily up to this time. The Vestry constructs stanks to receive the slop, and load the material into the Company's trucks, when it is of about the consistency of cheese. During the year 11,319 yards of slop and dry sweepings have been taken to Devonshire Street Railway Station. The cost for cartage has been £ s. d. s. d. 1056 5 0 or 1 10½ per yard. For trimming and loading into the Company's trucks. 115 13 0 or 0 2½ per yard. £1271 18 0 Being a saving of £224 18s. upon the outlay of last year for the same work. Watering. During the summer months the water carts were employed on 109 days, at a cost of £552 1s. 4d. for horses, carts, and drivers, and £369 1s. 6d. for 9,170,000 gallons of water. Lighting. The lighting of the Hamlet is done by the Commercial Gas Company, who light 742 lamps. The cost of lighting and maintenance to the Vestry was £3265 4s. 10d. No complaint has been made during the year, either of the quality or quantity of the gas supplied. 9 Sewers. New Sewers have been laid in Rhodeswell-road, Silver-street, and Wellington-street, at an outlay of £397 1s. 3d.

REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION & PUBLIC HEALTH OF Mile End Old Town, FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH the 27th, 1869, BY MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: T. PENNY & CO, PRINTERS, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, E. 1869. REPORT. Gentlemen, In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act (18 and 19 Vict., c. 120, s. 132, and 25 and 26 v., c. 102, s. 43), I beg to submit the Thirteenth Annual Report upon the state of the public health and general sanitary condition of the Hamlet, for the year ending March, 1869. Births and Deaths. By reference to Table I., it will be seen that the number of births for the year is slightly below that of the previous year, but 225 above the average of 5 previous years, and shows an excess of births over deaths of 1632. The birth-rate per 1000 of the population living in the Hamlet was 39.11, or within a fraction of 4 per cent. The rate for the whole kingdom was 36.36, and for the Metropolis 36.23 per 1000 population, being only a little over 3½ per cent. in each case. The same Table shows the number of deaths to have been 52 above the average of 5 previous years; this slight increase is chiefly attributable to the severe epidemic of scarlatina, which prevailed throughout the whole country. In the two winter quarters ending in March, 1869, 97 deaths occurred in the Hamlet from this disease, whooping-cough was also exceptionally fatal. But to form a just estimate of the public health of the Hamlet, we must compare our rate of mortality to the population living, with the death-rates of the Metropolis and the whole country. 4 Population and Rates of Mortality. The annual rate of mortality per 1000 population living in the Hamlet, was 20.97; in the Metropolis, 24.10; and for the whole country 22.76. The average rate for the rural districts of England, including small towns, is about 20 per 1000 population living The comparison between these rates (both for births and deaths) is very satisfactory with regard to this Hamlet. I am anxious to refer to the question of the present population of the Hamlet. In 1861, the census showed a total of 73064, since that period, over 2600 new houses have been built; estimating the number of occupants of each of such houses at 6 persons and deducting half as already resident in the Hamlet, this source alone would give an immigrant increase of 8,000 to the population; add to this the natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths, from which source, during the eight years since the last census, there is an increase in Mile End of 9,824 persons; this number is of course subject to reduction by removal. In view of these facts, I have estimated the present population at 90,000, and based the statistics and calculations thereon. The birth-rate of nearly 4 per cent, in the Hamlet, during the last 5 years, appears conclusive confirmatory evidence that the increase of population is rather under than over estimated. Epidemic Diseases. Tables II. and III. show the number of deaths from this class of diseases in each quarter of the year, and the total numbers for 10 previous years. The deaths for the year ending March last, exceeded by 55 the average of 10 previous years. This excess arises mainly from 5 scarlatina, which was especially fatal during the two winter quarters; the deaths from this disease increased from 10 and 19, in the two summer quarters respectively, to 60 and 37 in the two winter quarters, making a total of 126 deaths during the year from scarlatina, against 59 from the same cause during the previous year. The three last fatal epidemics of this disease begun in 1858—9, 1863—4, 1868—9, respectively, showing an equal interval, representing probably the period of incubation or elaboration of the specific virus of this disease. Scarlatina is more easily communicable, and its infectious property more permanent and persistently ineradicable than other ordinary epidemic diseases, hence the rapidity and certainty with which it spreads, unless vigorously checked, through schools and localities, or wherever young persons are congregated in numbers. Scarlatina is eminently a preventable disease, its morbid principle being especially producible by sewage matter as it exists in old obstructed and disused drains; once originated in thisway, its extension is only limited by the number ofpersons susceptible to infection who may come in its way. Small Pox.—There were only 4 deaths from this disease during the year. The average number of deaths for the 10 previous years was 22. Fever was fatal in 95 cases, the average number for 10 previous years being 73. Measles.—Twenty-nine deaths occurred from this disease, the average for 10 years being 49. At the commencement of the scarlatina epidemic in October, I caused printed notices to be sent to every known school in the Hamlet, containing instructions as to the best and most stringent measures to be adopted n the event of the disease appearing among the 6 scholars; at the same time bills and placards were distributed and posted throughout the Hamlet, containing plain and concise recommendations for the prevention and suppression of epidemic diseases, this plan is still continued, and, I believe, has been the means of doing much good. Causes of Disease. It is far easier to discover and remove the primary or generating causes of these diseases, than it is to check their spread by infection and contagion. For example, in three instances in which scarlatina had been especially fatal — George Place, Diamond Row, and Frimly Street—foul, obstructed, and very offensive drains were discovered under the basement floors of the houses. The necessary remedial works, and sanitary measures were at once carried out, and the disease did not spread in the locality immediately surrounding. In what may be termed "spontaneous outbreaks" of scarlatina, I have invariably been able to trace the cause to a similar origin, and I have little doubt that the primary causes of ordinary epidemic diseases emanate from similar subterranean sources. In London and most old towns, the dwellings are surrounded or undermined by old, obstructed, or disused drains, similar to the examples I have given, containing stagnant filth of the foulest description, and it is only a question of time for the maturation of the the disease virus and degree of facility for its escape into the air we breathe, or possibly the water we drink, or may be contact with the food we eat, for the inevitable production of some fatal blood poison disease. These decayed old sewers and drains are the most prolific sources of disease, their power for mischief being enhanced by their close relationship with the houses they were formerly intended to serve. 7 I do not think that recent sewage-matter, however injurious to health the emanations therefrom, has the power to generate specific diseases, such as scarlatina, measles, diphtheria, &c., otherwise we should have a permanent plague of epidemics, but if allowed to remain wholly or partially stagnant for a lengthened period, the duration of which would be modified by various circumstances, as dilution with water, exposure to the air, confinement in closed drains, extent of movement, if any, and nature of the sewage-matter, it acquires the property of generating specific epidemic diseases. In warm weather, during the evenings and nights, when the upper atmosphere condenses, the lower air becomes loaded with the sewer gases that have been to an enormous extent previously diffused during the day, the breathing air immediately above the ground being charged to saturation with these vapours; to this fact, the senses of both smell and taste bear ample testimony. It is in this source of atmospheric pollution we have, I fully believe, the principal cause in towns of the annual epidemics of summer and choleraic diarrhoea. The removal of the evil must be concomitant with the solution of the problems of sewer ventilation and sewage utilization. Sanitary Laws. A Royal Sanitary Commission is at present sitting, with a view to obtain information available for amended sanitary legislation. I have seen no evidence of their having investigated such practical, common, and certain causes of disease as some to which I have alluded, but probably they may yet descend to such essential enquiries. One important result to be hoped for is the consolidation and simplification of the laws relating to public health, which at present are vague, complicated, and often 8 impracticable in their application. I doubt whether the public is sufficiently impressed with the value of the science of sanitation, to submit to the literal application of laws sufficiently stringent and comprehensive, to be really effective in suppressing epidemic disease. Take for example an epidemic of scarlatina: to check its course, complete isolation of patients, and often removal of persons from their homes would be essential to success, in addition to the more practical sanitary works of disinfection of houses, bedding, clothing, &c. These measures must all be carried out systematically, stringently, and under competent authoritative supervision; their partial application, in the case of such a disease, would produce only partially good results. You cannot check or extingush a fire without removing or isolating the combustible material, and by the ample application of water; leave, however little flame and combustible matter within reach, and the conflagration will spread; so with these infectious diseases, they must be treated as I have indicated to produce their effectual suppression. To attain this object is quite practicable, but as I have said, I do not think the public is yet prepared for such application of the necessary means. I trust the Royal Commission will obtain such information as to induce them to base their recommendations for future legislation upon practical rather than theoretical data, so that the administration of the laws relating to the public health may be really efficient, and, at the same time, just and economical. Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Act. The powers given under this Act have been exercised in two instances, embracing fourteen houses in Frimley Street, North Ward, and Eaton Place, Centre Ward. 9 My Reports thereon being referred to the Surveyor, he recommended certain structural alterations in all the houses, to remedy the faults I had indicated. These recommendations were adopted by the Vestry. The necessary works were then executed by the owners to the satisfaction of the Surveyor. Hospitals. Number of Patients sent to Hospitals at the cost of the Hamlet. Fever Hospital. Small Pox Hospital. Men. Women. Children. Men. Women. Children. 54 37 13 2 1 0 Total 107 Being exactly the same total as last year; but the numbers of the respective diseases varied, this year the fever cases were 104 against 93 in the previous year; small pox cases, 3 this year against 14 previous year. The immediate cost to the Hamlet for the patients alone would necessarily be about the same as the previous year, viz., £349 10s. 8d., but this primary charge is insignificent, if compared, as in my last year's Report, with an estimate of the ultimate cost resulting from deaths of parents leaving children a permanent charge upon the ratepayers, by the patients themselves being disabled from and losing work, or through impaired vital powers, remaining for an indefinite period incapable of arduous labour. My object in making special allusion to this charge upon the rates, is to promote an increased interest in such sanitary works as will not only save many valuable lives, and prevent much human suffering, but would also prove a great pecuniary gain, by prevention and removal of those conditions, which experience has clearly proved to be the cause of such a large proportion of disease and death. 10 Special Reports.

The average illuminating power of the gas supplied by the Commercial Gas Company has been equal to 14.4 sperm candles or 2.4 candles higher than required by Act of Parliament. 13 Purity. Ammonia.—The quantity has varied, but has never exceeded from ½ to 3 grains per 100 cubic feet—the last testing showing only half a grain—the maximum quantity permitted by the Gas Referees under the City Gas Act of 1868, but which does not apply to the Commercial Company, is five grains of ammonia to 100 feet of gas, this standard has probably been somewhat arbitrarily fixed. The Act of 1860, which rules the Commercial in common with other Companies, does not prescribe any specific quantity of ammonia, but provides for a mode of paper-testing by which all Gas Companies would be repeatedly liable to conviction if the quantity of ammonia were only one-fifth part of the amount allowed under the City Companies Act of 1868—the test is delicate, and shows the presence of an infinitesimal proportion of ammonia. It has occurred during several successive days that this test has failed to detect the presence of any ammonia in the Commercial Company's gas. Sulphuretted Hydrogen has never been present. Sulphur.—Under the Act of 1860, 20 grains to 100 cubic feet is the maximum quantity allowed for this impurity. At that period, I believe, it was found quite impracticable to manufacture gas that should with any degree of certainty contain only this amount of sulphur. Hence the City Act of 1868 does not prescribe any specified amount but confers upon referees the power to fix from time to time, as in the case of ammonia, the quantity of sulphur which shall be ligitimately present in the gas. The last testing showed 23 grains of bisulphide of carbon to 100 cubic feet in the Commercial Company's gas, but the average of numerous testings was only 18½ grains. From this short review of gas testing it will be seen that gasology has not yet attained the position of an exact science. 14 It is, however, satisfactory to know that the gas supplied to this Hamlet exceeds the requirements of the Act of Parliament. Every facility has been given by the Company to investigate both the manufacture and quality of their gas. A recent request from me for the Company to provide an improved photometer at the local Testing House was at once agreed to by Mr. Robert Jones, the Engineer.

Open Places. The subject of Epping Forest having recently given a special interest to the question of open places in and around densely populated towns, I have thought it my duty, with the permission of the Vestry, to state very briefly my views upon the question. There is no difficulty in conceding the truism that air and light are necessary to human existence, it must therefore be equally true that their value in this respect bears direct relation to their purity and freedom, Any cause which shall vitiate the one or obstruct the due action of the other, must, in a corresponding degree, be prejudicial to health. If these simple but vital facts are applied to the case of vast multitudes of people congregated together, as in this Metropolis, without a single urban oasis of any extent in the wilderness of bricks, the question becomes one of so serious a nature as to be difficult of exaggeration. The urgency of the question is greatly enhanced by the present imminent danger of Epping Forest being extensively enclosed, and so lost for the purposes for which it has hitherto been used. There is every indication that London will continue as hitherto to increase in population and extend in area; imagine the result, say, in only ten years, probably another circle of two miles around the present circumference would in that time be built upon; let this go on for an indefinite period without interference, and the result to 22 the public health and general well being of the community must be disastrous. How is the atmosphere, or rather the compound of vapours and smoke which represent it, to become purified? The early morning atmosphere of London is now tolerably clear and pure, the smoke (which ought to be more consumed) and other impurities having managed to escape, but to be presently again re-placed by a similar almost unbreatliable atmosphere. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to obtain a sufficient supply of pure air for the due maintenance of health. Hence the pressing necessity for legislative interference in the question of Metropolitan Building Extension—not, of course, to limit, but to regulate building of dwellings. For instance, it might be enacted that no more houses should be erected within two miles of the present inhabited circumference of the Metropolis, the circle to be defined and modified according to circumstances. In this way a great circular lung or reservoir of air would be secured to the half stifled people. It is quite plain that some such course must eventually be adopted, enforced, probably, by the gradual degeneracy of the multitudes who are compelled to exist permanently under such devitalizing conditions. Provision is made in the Sanitary Acts to prevent overcrowding of human beings in the interior of houses, on account of the danger to health, in an insufficient supply of air. The same principle and effect would apply and result from overcrowding houses themselves for habitation upon a given area. This is probably the most important of all questions relating to the public health. A plentiful supply of air, light, and means of recreation, would do more to resist and suppress disease than all other sanitary measures combined. For these reasons, the recently expressed adverse views of the present Government, with regard to 23 Epping Forest, are to be deplored, and the more so because they are the views of a Government which attained power presumably to legislate for the social well being and happiness of the people. Another example in our own District is afforded, of disregard to local feeling and interest, in the sanction given by the Poor Law Board to the establishment of a Casual Workhouse, for another Parish in the best part of this Hamlet, without consulting either the local authorities or inhabitants. Such an advent is certainly an additional source of danger to health, as well as depreciation of the value of property. It was refused to withdraw or modify such sanction, upon an appeal being made with that object. These are vital questions in relation to the public health, otherwise I should not have troubled the Vestry by their introduction. The loss of Epping Forest would especially be a calamity. Better far to disestablish and compensate Lords of Manors, than to allow the health and enjoyment of the people to be sacrificed by the deprivation of that which contributes and is essential to both.
