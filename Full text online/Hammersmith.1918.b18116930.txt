To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith. Gentlemen,—I beg to submit a Report for the year 1918. which, in accordance with the suggestion of the Local Government Hoard, is limited to a record of the most important facts and figures. I beg to take the opportunity of thanking Dr. Jackson, who for the last two years carried out the duties of Medical Officer of Health, during mv absence in the Army. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, .J. B. HOWELL, Medical Officer of Health. Population.—The following estimates of population have been adopted by the Registrar General for the calculation of the Death and Birth rates of the Borough. For the Death Rate (estimated civilian population 115,833 For the Birth Rate (estimated total population) 129,787 Looking at the crowded state of the Borough it is probable that both are under estimated. The ration card population 133,000 Marriages.—1,149 marriages were registered during the year against 1,121 in 1917, and the marriage rate, i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 inhabitants was 17.7. Births.—Including 205 children born of Hammersmith mothers in lying-in institutions situated in other Boroughs, 2,014 births were registered, representing a birth rate of 15.5 per 1,000, being the lowest recorded in Hammersmith and 2.2 below that of 1917. Illegitimacy.—The illegitimates numbered 169 or 8.4 per cent of the total births. 2 Deaths.—During 1918, 1445 deaths were registered in the borough, but of these 175 were of persons not belonging to the borough, while 713 inhabitants of Hammersmith died outside the borough, chiefly in various public institutions. There were therefore 1,983 deaths of persons having their usual residence in Hammersmith, representing a death rate of 17.1 per 1,000 of the estimated civilian population, which is the highest death rate recorded since 1899. The death rate of the County of London was 18.9 per 1,000, and in the various Metropolitan boroughs the rates ranged from 13.4 in Hampstead to 24.3 in Shoreditch. Excess of Births Over Deaths.—The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 31, compared with 643, 937 and 787 in the preceding three years. The following table gives the statistics of the borough during 1918 and the five previous years in the form prescribed by the Local Government Board. TABLE I.
