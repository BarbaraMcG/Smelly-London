Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report for 1945 which again contains only the bare essential matters with regard to the health of the district. In spite of the ravages of war the health of the district is extremely satisfactory, the infectious disease rate has again been low, and I am glad to report that no major epidemic has occurred. Owing to the cessation of hostilities the work in the district, which was for the time being left in abeyance, has again been taken up, and this has necessitated considerably more effort from all the staff of the department, to whom I take the opportunity of expressing my sincere appreciation of the work which they have carried out so efficiently. I am, Your obedient servant, L. D. BAILEY. Medical Officer of Health. 4 MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE Medical Officers, Middlesex County Council: Northwood, Eastcote and Ruislip: Mrs. E. G.

Out of the 9 cases of Diphtheria notified, 3 occured in Service patients between the ages of 18 and 36 years, and it is unlikely that these persons had been immunised. Of the remaining 6, 2 were female adults who probably had not been immunised; 3 occurred in children between 2 and 8 years who had not been immunised, one of whom died. The other case was a child of 4 years who had been immunised in June 1944 and who contracted the disease in November 1945. This was a mild case and recovered quickly. Smallpox: There have been no further cases of Smallpox in this area since the epidemic of 1944.
