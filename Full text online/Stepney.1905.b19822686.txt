STE6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst FOR THE Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. 1905. 1 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST, Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting to you my fifth Annual Report, which deals with the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Borough of Stepney, for the year 1905. Population. The population estimated to the middle of the year was 305,466, distributed as follows:— FOR THE YEAR 1905, To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Limehouse District 58,259 St. George's District 50,992 Mile End District 115,642 Whitechapel District 80,573 4 Births. The total number of births registered during the year was 10,596, which consisted of 5,299 males and 5,269 females. 1,918 births were registered in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 32.9 per 1,000 of the population. 2,126 births were registered in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 41.6 per 1,000 of the population. 3,938 births were registered in Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 34 per 1,000 of the population. 2,614 births were registered in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 32.4 per 1,000 of the population. The birth-rate throughout the whole Borough was 34.6 per 1,000, while that of London as a whole was 27.1 per 1,000. The birth-rate, though 7.5 above London as a whole, is not only lower than the average rate for the ten years 1895-1904, but it is the lowest on record. The method of calculating the birth-rate is slightly different to what it has been in previous years. This is the first time it has been possible to distribute the births occurring in Public Institutions to the various districts from whence the mothers have come. It has been found necessary to deduct 164 births which belonged to other districts, and to add 28 births belonging to this Borough, which took place in various institutions outside the district. There are, therefore, 136 births to be deducted this year from the total, which would be included if the same method were adopted as in former years. The difference is not great, and does not materially alter the conclusions, inasmuch as on the old basis the birth-rate would be 351 per 1,000, which would still be the lowest on record. The birth-rate is lower in each district than it was in the previous year, with the exception of the Limehouse District. In the latter the birth-rate is -2 per 1,000 higher, but this is more than accounted for by the fact that to the births actually occurring in the district, are added 95 births which took place in the Mothers' Home, Commercial Road;—1 in the Mile End Infirmary, 1 in the Whitechapel Infirmary, 8 in the London Hospital, and 5 22 in the Stepney Workhouse. The women who gave birth to these 127 were residents of the Limehouse District, and were confined during the period they were in-patients. Deducting this number the rate would be 30.7. The birth-rate in St. George's was 41.6, or 2.2 per 1,000 less than in the previous year; though 72 births are included this year, to which no allusion would have been made in previous years. Of these 72 births, 59 occurred in the Mothers' Home, 8 in the London Hospital, 4 in the Whitechapel Infirmary, and 1 in the Mile End Infirmary. Deducting this additional number, the birth-rate would be 40.2 per 1,000. The birth-rate in Mile End Old Town was 34 per 1,000 of the population. This is 4.5 per 1,000 less than in the previous year. 372 births occurred in 1905 in the Mothers' Lying-in Home, Commercial Road. This institution is situated in Mile End, and in former years all the births would be included in that district, though 86 only of the 372 women confined were residents of Mile End. 58 births occurred in the Mile End Infirmary, of which 56 belonged to Mile End, 1 to Limehouse, and 1 to St. George's. On the other hand, 9 Mile End residents gave birth in the Whitechapel Infirmary, 12 in the London Hospital, 1 in Stepney Workhouse, and 3 in the City of London Lying-in Hospital. Calculating on the old basis the birth-rate would be 36.3 per 1,000, or 2.2 less than in 1904. The birth-rate in the Whitechapel District was 1.4 less than in the previous year, and if the calculations were made on the former basis, the birth-rate would be lower still. It will thus be seen that the birth-rate of the Limehouse District is similar to that of the Whitechapel District, and that of Mile End is only slightly higher. The birth-rate of St. George's is by far the highest of any district in London, and is 14.5 per 1,000 higher than that of London as a whole. The reason is, probably, the fact that the old residents in recent years have moved into the suburbs, and their houses have been taken by aliens who are chiefly of the child-bearing age. Old houses have also been demolished, and large model dwellings erected instead. These dwellings have also been occupied by a similar class of people. It is therefore obvious that when old residents leave, and their places taken by young married people, the birth-rate must, for a few years, be above the average. The larger the 6 number of persons of this age-period in a district, the greater will be the number of children born, and the higher will be the birth-rate. 75 births occurred in the London Hospital:— 10 belonged to the Whitechapel District. 12 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 8 belonged to St. George's. 8 belonged to the Limehouse District 37 belonged to outlying districts. 117 births occurred in the Whitechapel Infirmary:— 90 belonged to the Whitechapel District. 9 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 4 belonged to St. George's. 1 belonged to the Limehouse District. 13 belonged to other districts outside the Borough. 372 births occurred in the Mothers' Home, Commercial Road:— 86 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 59 belonged to St. George's. 95 belonged to the Limehouse District. 18 belonged to the Whitechapel District. 114 belonged to other districts outside the Borough. 58 births occurred in the Mile End Infirmary:— 56 belonged to Mile End. 1 belonged to Limehouse. 1 belonged to St. George's. 23 births occurred in the Stepney Workhouse:— 22 belonged to the Limehouse District. 1 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 5 of the births that occurred in the City of London Lying-in Hospital, Finsbury, belonged to this Borough. 3 to Mile End Old Town, and 2 to Whitechapel. Illegitimate Births. 43 illegitimate births were registered in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 22.4 per 1,000 births. 27 illegitimate births were registered in St. George's, or at the rate of 12.7 per 1,000 births. 7 67 illegitimate births were registered in Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 17.2 per 1000 births. 51 illegitimate births were registered in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 15.0 per 1,000 births. The number throughout the whole Borough was 188, which corresponds to a rate of 17.7 per 1,000 births, while that for the whole of London was 37 per 1,000. The number of illegitimate births was less in St. George's and Whitechapel than in the previous year. There was a slight increase in Mile End Old Town; and in the Limehouse District the number was more than doubled. The latter may be partly accounted for by the fact that, of the 22 births belonging to Limehouse that occurred in the Stepney Workhouse, 13 were illegitimate. The births in the Stepney Workhouse were in former years included with the Poplar returns. Marriages. The Marriages during the year numbered 2,732, or 69 more than in the previous year. The proportion of persons married was 17.8 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was 16.9 per 1,000. 416 marriages occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 14.2 persons married, per 1,000 of the population. 273 marriages occurred in St. George's, or at the rate of 10.7 persons married, per 1,000 of the population. 1,450 marriages occurred in Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 25 persons married, per 1,000 of the population. 593 marriages occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 14.7 persons married, per 1,000 of the population. Deaths. The total number of deaths occurring in the Borough was 5,673 Deduct deaths occurring within the Borough among persons not belonging thereto 1,014 4,659 Add deaths of residents that occurred outside the Borough 774 5,433 8 The correct number of deaths, which include those of residents that occurred in Outlying Institutions, but exclusive of those of non-residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated in the Borough, numbered 5,433. This corresponds to a death-rate of 17.7 per 1,000 of the population. This is the lowest death-rate that I have a complete record of. 1,184 deaths occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 20.3 per 1,000 of the population. 1,041 deaths occurred in St. George's, or at the rate of 20.4 per 1,000 of the population. 1,964 deaths occurred in Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 16.9 per 1,000 of the population. 1,244 deaths occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 15.4 per 1,000 of the population. The following table shows the death-rate throughout the Borough and in the various districts since 1890:— Limehouse. St. George's. Mile End. Whitechapel. The whole Borough. 1890 26.8 35.0 20.0 24.0 25.2 1891 26.0 29.1 21.2 24.7 24.4 1892 25.5 27.8 23.0 25.2 24.9 1893 27.7 31.0 22.8 25.0 25.5 1894 24.2 26.5 21.1 20.3 22.3 1895 27.3 29.5 22.5 22.8 24.0 1896 23.7 24.4 19.9 20.1 21.7 1897 25.1 26.4 18.7 19.7 21.4 1898 23.7 24.8 23.4 19.7 22.7 1899 25.5 27.1 20.3 19.3 22.0 1900 25.9 24.4 19.3 18.1 21.0 1901 24.6 23.0 18.5 19.3 20.8 1902 23.6 22.1 19.0 19.2 20.5 1903 19.7 20.3 16.3 17.5 17.9 1904 23.2 21.4 18.2 17.4 19.5 1905 20.3 20.4 16.9 15.4 17.7 9 From the above table, it will be seen that the death-rate in the whole Borough is the lowest since 1890, and with the exception of 1903, it has been the lowest in each individual district. The most marked decrease last year was in the Whitechapel District, where the death-rate was much lower than it has ever been. There has been a gradual decline in the death-rate of the Limehouse District and St. George's since 1900. Indeed, in these two districts the rate has been under 21 per 1,000 on one previous occasion only. Compared with 1904 the causes of death were:— Disease 1904. 1905. Increase. Decrease.

Nine occurred in Mile End, one in St. George's, and one in the Limehouse District. Nine of the persons attacked were vaccinated, and two were unvaccinated. All the patients were above 10 years of age. Of the two unvaccinated cases, one recovered, and the other—a girl 13 years of age—died. The first person attacked with Small Pox was William Nunn, aged 50, of 38, Bradwell Street, Mile End. He worked in a large printing establishment in the Borough of Finsbury. The patient was taken ill on February 23rd, the rash appeared on February 25th, and he was removed to the Hospital on February 27th. In this house there were 3 families, consisting of 13 people. On March 11th, 12th, and 14th, five of his children, and three others from the same address, were removed to the Hospital, suffering from Small Pox. On March 3rd, Fievall Berknosky, aged 25, was taken by a friend to the London Hospital, where he was found to be suffering from Small Pox. He arrived from Russia on the previous day, but could not give the address where he had slept that night. The only address that he could give was "Jewish Shelter," Cannon Street Road. In spite of all inquiries, I could not trace where ne had slept. It may fairly be assumed that he slept in a room with several others, and though no disinfection was possible, no other cases occurred. 15 On April 4th, Alice Cunningham, aged 26, was removed from 8, North Block, Peabody's Buildings, to the Hospital suffering from Small Pox. Measles. The number of deaths was 151, or 25 less than in the preceding year. 47 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .80 per 1,000. 23 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .45 per 1,000. 56 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .48 per 1,000. 25 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .31 per 1,000. The death-rate for the whole Borough was at the rate of .48 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole of London was .37. The infant class-rooms of three schools were closed for a period of a fortnight during the year on account of the prevalence of Measles. Scarlet Fever. 1,771 cases were notified, of which 1,646, or nearly 93 per cent., were removed to the various Fever Hospitals. 429 occurred in the Limehouse District, with 24 deaths. 190 occurred in the St. George's District, with 5 deaths. 689 occurred in the Mile End District, with 21 deaths 463 occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 11 deaths. The death-rate for the whole Borough was 19 per 1,000, while that for the whole of London was 12 per 1,000. The number of cases notified gradually increased week by week, from 18 in the second week in June, to 64 in the third week in August. There was a sudden drop for two weeks, and then the numbers gradually rose to the maximum for the year, which was 68 in the fourth week in September. Afterwards the number gradually declined until the end of the year. I found on investigating the matter that a large number of the cases were notified from the neighbourhood of Montague Street and Wentworth Street. As a result of an anonymous communication, I visited College Buildings and examined the children resident therein. I discovered one boy whose skin was in a peeling condition. A Doctor had been attending 16 him for over a fortnight, but as the disease had not been diagnosed correctly, the boy had been allowed to go out and mix with other children. I removed the patient immediately to the Fever Hospital. I have no doubt that he has been the means of spreading the disease to other children in the immediate neighbourhood. Another case was responsible for the spread of the disease in another part of the Borough, three weeks afterwards. A girl, aged 17, went to a Doctor, who notified the case as Scarlet Fever. Unfortunately the patient and her mother gave a wrong address. Later on, I found her, but she had then returned to work, though her hands were in a peeling condition. She was employed by a large potted meat firm. She declared that the peeling of her hands was due to the conditions she worked under. Her duties consisted in chopping up boiled meat, previous to its being tinned, and in washing up afterwards. She said her hands had been peeling for two years, and that the hands of the other girls were in a similar state. I immediately visited the premises where she was employed and examined those that worked with her in the room. There was no sign of any peeling, and the other girls informed me that they did not notice there was anything the matter with the patient's hands until the day she returned to work after her illness. These statements, which I afterwards found to be untrue, appear as if the wrong address was deliberately given to the Doctor with the intention of wilfully misleading us, so that she should not be prevented from following her employment. Whooping Cough. The number of deaths was 123, or 8 less than in the previous year. This corresponds to a death-rate of .40 per 1,000. 52 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .89 per 1,000 of the population. 29 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .56 per 1,000 of the population. 34 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .29 per 1,000 of the population. 8 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 09 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate throughout London was .32 per 1,000. 17 Diphtheria 530 cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year, and 488, or 92 per cent., were removed to the Fever Hospitals. 1 ne number of cases was 195 less than in the preceding year. 87 cases occurred in the Limehouse District, with 13 deaths, which is equivalent to a death- rate of 22 per 1,000 of the population. 109 cases occurred in the St. George's District, with 16 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .31 per 1,000 of the population. 190 cases occurred in the Mile End District, with 18 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .15 per 1,000 of the population. 144 cases occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 16 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of 19 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate throughout the Borough was .20 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole of London was 12 per 1,000. Croup. 5 cases were notified during the year, and all were treated at their homes. 1 occurred in the Limehouse District. The patient recovered. 1 occurred in the St. George's District, which proved fatal. 3 occurred in the Whitechapel District. All recovered. Enteric Fever 117 cases occurred during the year, or 66 less than in the previous year. Seven only were treated at their own homes. 23 cases occurred in the Limehouse District, with 6 deaths. 26 cases occurred in St. George's. None proved fatal. 47 cases occurred in Mile End, with 9 deaths. 21 cases occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 6 deaths. b 18 The death-rate throughout the whole of the Borough was 07 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate in the whole of London was 05 per 1,000. Typhus Fever. Typhus Fever is one of the most contagious diseases known to Medicine. It originates and spreads to predisposed individuals solely by the direct or indirect transmission of the specific contagium, and develops in the body of the patient. The mode of transmission, and entrance into the body, is probably in all essentials similar to that which obtains in Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Measles, etc. The poison of Typhus Fever is not carried a very great distance through the air. Therein it differs from the poison of Small Pox, which can undoubtedly be wafted across a street, and carried to the inmates of a house on the opposite side. It is owing to the fact that the contagium cannot easily be carried a great distance, that the disease did not spread when the undermentioned cases were admitted to the London Hospital and that the wards are large and well ventilated. The infection is rapidly destroyed by dilution with fresh air, and does not cling to articles of clothing. Five cases were notified during the year, four occurring in Mile End and one in Whitechapel. On January 14th, Milly G, aged 12, of 21, Brantridge Street, attended as an out-patient at the London Hsopital. She complained of headache, vomiting, and had a temperature of 101 degrees, but was not considered ill enough to be admitted. On January 17th, Dr. C, of Burdett Road, was asked to attend her. He daily visited the patient at her home from January 17th to January 24th inclusive. On the latter date Dr. C came to the conclusion that she was suffering from Typhoid Fever, and notified the fact accordingly. The patient was removed to the Fever Hospital on the same date, and the premises were disinfected. On January 31st, I was informed by the Medical Superintendent of the Hospital, that the disease the patient was suffering from, was Typhus Fever, and not Typhoid. I informed Dr. C of the Medical Superintendent's opinion. The patient's father and mother, with 5 other children, besides the 19 patient herself, occupied four rooms at 21, Brantridge Street. The two other rooms in the house, which are on the second floor, were occupied by a man and wife with six children. These two rooms were slightly overcrowded, and a notice was at once served to have it abated. The premises throughout were in a good condition, all the rooms having been cleansed, limewashed and papered before the house was taken by these two families, three months previously. On February 4th, Abraham, aged 15, was admitted to the London Hospital, supposed to be suffering from Rheumatism. On February 7th, I received a notification from the London Hospital that Abraham was suffering from Typhoid Fever. I communicated with the Hospital Authorities, and informed them of the previous case of Typhus Fever in the same family. Later, he was removed to Homerton Fever Hospital as it was thought he was suffering from Typhus Fever. The latter diagnosis was confirmed by the Medical Superintendent. On February 14th, Kate, aged 9, and on February l6Gth, Woolf, aged 10, were removed to the same Fever Hospital. Both were suffering from Typhus Fever. In tracing the origin of the disease, I found that the father of these children was a tailor's presser, and had been working in Reading for several months. He returned home to Brantridge Street for the Christmas holidays, and on December 25th he was taken ill. On that day he was seen at his home by a Medical man, who after carefully examining him, thought he was suffering from slight Pleurisy. The Doctor did not see him after this date. Mr. G got gradually better, and on January 3rd he went to Reading. According to his statement, he still felt very weak, and saw a local Doctor. He did not feel well enough to continue his work, and on January 9th he returned to Brantridge Street. As stated above, Milly was taken ill five days afterwards, and was attended by Dr. C from January 17th to January 24th. Dr. C himself was taken ill on January 31st, and was made an in-patient at the London Hospital on February 5th. At the time of admission he was supposed to be suffering from Influenza. He became rapidly worse—mental symptoms being very marked—and died on February 14 th. As the cause of death seemed doubtful, a post-mortem examination was made. The Spleen was enlarged, the Lungs were congested, and the blood showed the usual characteristics seen in a person that has died from severe b 2 20 fever. The cause of death was certified to be Influenza and Toxaemia. I called the attention of the Physician who made the post-mortem examination —who also attended Dr. C when alive to the fact that the Doctor had attended Milly from the 17th to 24th. He adhered to his opinion that the disease was not Typhus Fever. Due importance must, of course, be placed on his opinion, as he had the advantage of seeing the patient alive, and of afterwards making a post-mortem examination. I communicated with the Medical Officer of Health of Reading, giving him the above facts and Mr. G's. address while he resided in Reading. Personally I am of opinion that Dr. C, as well as the others, suffered from Typhus Fever. As the former was not officially certified to be suffering from Typhus Fever, I have excluded him from the number of notifications and deaths from that disease. Both the Doctor's premises and 21, Brantridge Street were thoroughly disinfected. Three Wards at the London Hospital were put in quarantine. No fresh patient was admitted to either of these three Wards for a period of three weeks, the addresses of all those discharged therefrom being communicated to me, and these were kept under supervision at their homes. No other case occurred as a result of infection from any of the above. On October 12th a patient was removed from 36, Fashion Street, supposed to be suffering from Typhoid Fever, but on the following day the Medical Superintendent of Homerton Fever Hospital notified the disease as Typhus Fever. Erysipelas. 504 cases were notified, and 110 were removed to various Hospitals and Infirmaries. 85 occurred in the Limehouse District. Six died. 92 occurred in the St. George's District. Five died. 160 occurred in the Mile End District. Seven died. 167 occurred in the Whitechapel District. Five died. Diarrhoea. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, which includes Epidemic and Zymotic Enteritis, Dysentery and Dysenteric Diarrhoea, Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhoea, was 288. Of these, 274 were infants under one year of age. 21 59 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 101 per 1,000. 67 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 1.31 per 1,000. 122 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 105 per 1,000. 40 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .49 per 1,000. The death-rate for the whole of the Borough was .94 per 1,000. Enteritis. The number of deaths from Enteritis, which includes Gastro-Enteritis, Muco-Enteritis, and Gastric Catarrh, was 147. Of this number, 66 were children under one year of age. 50 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .85 per 1,000. 19 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .37 per 1,000. 47 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .40 per 1,000. 31 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .37 per 1,000. The total death-rate from Diarrhoea and Enteritis throughout the whole Borough was 1.42 per 1,000 of the population. Puerperal Fever. 14 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified during the year, and nine proved fatal. 2 occurred in the Limehouse District, and one proved fatal. 3 occurred in the St. George's District, with 2 deaths. 5 occurred in the Mile End District, with 3 deaths. 4 occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 3 deaths. Zymotic Diseases. 1 he total deaths from Zymotic Diseases numbered 718. This number corresponds to a death-rate of 2.35 per 1.000 of the populatioa It includes deaths from Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Croup, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever, and Diarrhoea. 202 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 3.46 per 1,000. 22 143 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 2.80 per 1,000. 264 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 2.36 per 1,000. 109 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 1.35 per 1,000. Diseases of Respiratory Organs. There were 1,164 deaths due to diseases of Respiratory Organs, which coresponds to a death-rate of 3.81 per 1,000 of the population. 228 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 3.91 per 1,000. 216 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 4.23 per 1,000. 429 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 3.70 per 1,000. 291 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 3.61 per 1,000. Infantile Mortality. 1,514 Infants died under 1 year of age. This corresponds to a deathrate of 142.8 per 1,000 births. This number is 259 less than in the previous year, when the death-rate was 158.8 per 1,000 births. 313 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 163.1 per 1,000 births. 334 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 1571 per 1,000 births. 555 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 140.9 per 1,000 births. 312 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 119.3 per 1,000 births. The infantile mortality is the lowest of the Boroughs in the Eastern portion of the Metropolis, and, indeed, compares very favourably with the other districts in London. Though the mortality in the Limehouse District is lower than in previous years, it is still too high, and maintains its position of having nearly the highest infantile mortality in London. 23 It is only fair to mention, that there has been a gradual improvement in recent years in this direction, as will be seen by the following table, which is not so marked in the other districts:— Limehouse. District St. George's. Mile End. Whitechapel District The whole Borough, 1899 216 199 161 147 174 1900 227 141 166 140 166 1901 211 185 150 140 165 1902 197 160 163 117 155 1903 165 170 122 138 141 1904 208 161 145 143 158 1905 163 157 140 119 142 The infantile mortality in the Limehouse District was at its highest in 1900. Curiously enough, the neighbouring district of St. George's had the lowest mortality in this year. The high infantile mortality in the Limehouse District in 1900 received the serious consideration of the late Limehouse Board of Works. It was decided in this year to appoint Health Visitors to visit and instruct mothers in the proper rearing of infants. The Local Government Board refused to sanction the appointment of such officers and to give them the same status as Sanitary Inspectors, which was necessary in order to have half their salaries returned. The Limehouse Board, on the other hand, refused to proceed with the appointments if they had to pay the whole of their salaries. There the matter ended, except that pamphlets on the proper method of rearing infants were distributed extensively throughout the district, by means of Medical men practising in the district, district visitors, nurses, etc. The matter was further considered by the Stepney Borough Council three years ago. The Public Health Committee recommended the appointment of Health Visitors, but the Council refused to approve of their recommendation. Fortunately, a Health Visitor was appointed to a small district in the Borough known as Limehouse Fields, through the kindness of a well-known nobleman who paid her salary for two years. The Committee were very fortunate in securing the services of Miss Forrester a lady holding the necessary certificates, as well as possessing tact, which is quite as essential to the successful carrying out of the duties involved. The district selected is bounded by Commercial Road on the south, White Horse Street on the west, Ben Jonson Road on the north, and the Canal on the east. This area was selected because it had the highest infantile mortality, and the people inhabiting it changed their homes less frequently, than in any other part of the Borough. Miss 24 Forrester commenced her duties on October 1st, 1903. As may be imagined, the work of the Health Visitor at the beginning was " uphill," suspicion of her motive being one of the principal obstacles. Her visits, however, were as a whole, well received, and in most cases appreciated. She visited and re-visited the homes of 721 infants, 74 of whom died under the age of one year. The rate of infant mortality among infants she visited, was therefore 102 per 1,000 births. This is very satisfactory when it is considered that this area was selected on account of its high infantile mortality, and that the infant mortality for the whole of the Limehouse District in that period was 185 per 1,000 births. A large majority of these infants were suckled by the mother, only a few comparatively being fed entirely by artificial means. On the other hand, it is very difficult to find out, from the parents, to what extent breast feeding was supplemented by oatmeal, biscuits, soaked bread, or "just a little of what we have ourselves." As the result of continuous teaching by the Health Visitor, there is undoubtedly less ignorance on that point, and more knowledge of the value of milk as an article of diet for the infant. Most of the mothers believe that whenever the babies cry, they must be fed. It is most difficult to make them comprehend that babies cry from other causes than that of hunger. The wasting diseases that are so common among babies in the East End, as well as elsewhere, are often due to the overloading of the stomachs with unsuitable food. The Health Visitor always pointed out the disadvantages of the bottle with the long tube. Though they were not quite extinct at the end of her two years' labours, they were far less in evidence. The "dummy" seems to be considered the panacea for all the trials and discomforts of infant life. It does not matter how dirty the wretched thing is, as soon as the child cries and the feeding bottle is not convenient, the "dummy" is used. The Visitor spoke to the mothers, and advised them to do away with the "dummy," and try to reason as to the cause of the child's crying. The "dummy "could not possibly do away. with the cause of the trouble. Overlaying is a frequent cause of death of infants in our Borough. The parents were always advised to have a separate sleeping accommodation for the infants, even if it only consisted of a comfortably constituted box. The Health Visitor was only able to persuade the parents to adopt this course in five cases. 25 The ever present poverty and the large number of drinking mothers were the two most distressing elements of the Health Visitor's work. The former produced ill-nourished mothers, the latter idle, careless or indifferent ones. Both factors are to be reckoned with in the struggle against infantile mortality. At the end of two years, the Health Visitor was re-appointed for a similar period. The Committee who controlled her actions and supervised her w ork, thought fit to change her district. In my opinion, however, it is only when she has become thoroughly well known to the inhabitants, suspicion allayed, and her motives appreciated, that such an officer can be of real benefit to the mothers in teaching them the proper management of infants, and thus tending to lower the high infantile mortality of the district. Old Age. 198 deaths were due to old age. This corresponds to a death-rate of .64 per 1,000 of the population. 47 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .80 per 1,000. 22 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .43 per 1,000. 94 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .81 per 1,000. 35 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .43 per 1,000. Alcoholism. The number of deaths due to Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver was 64, or 32 less than in the preceding year. 19 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .32 per 1.ooo. 5 occurred in the St George's District, or at the rate of 09 per 1,000. 19 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 16 per 1,000. 21 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .26 per 1,000. 26 Cancer. The number of deaths from Cancer was 228. 52 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .89 per 1,000. 39 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .76 per 1,000. 90 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .77 per r,ooo. 47 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .58 per 1,000. Notifiable Diseases. 2,957 cases of Infectious Disease were notified during the year, and 2,377 were removed to various Hospitals and Infirmaries. 628 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 10.78 per 1,000. 421 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 8.25 per 1,000. 1,105 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 9.55 per 1,000. 803 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 9.96 per 1,000. The greatest number notified was in the fourth week of September, when 102 cases were notified. This was due probably to the fact that 68 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified in this week. This was the greatest number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified in one week during the year. Twenty-four cases of Typhoid Fever were notified in the fourth week in January, which was the greatest number in one week during the year. Nine cases of Diphtheria were the largest number notified, whicli occurred in the second week in October. The largest number of notifiable diseases occurred in the Limehouse District in the third week of August, in St. George's and Whitechapel Districts in the fourth week of September, and in Mile End Old Town in the fourth week of October., Chart showing the number of cases notified week by week of Scarlet Fever, Typhoid and Diphtheria during 1905 SCARLET FEVER I DIPHTHERIA ( Chart showing the total number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified week by week in Limehouse, St. George's, Mile End and Whitechapel, during 1905.

This corresponds to a death-rate of 1.87 per 1,000 of the population. 98 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1.68 per 1,000. 117 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 2.29 per 1,000. 171 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 1.47 per 1,000. 187 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 2.32 per 1,000. In addition to the above, there were 159 deaths from other Tuberculai Diseases. This corresponds to a death-rate of .52 per 1,000 of the population. 42 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .72 per 1,000. 29 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .56 per 1,000. 53 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .45 per 1,000. 35 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .43 per 1,000. In my Annual Report of 1904, I gave the result of my inquiries with regard to the voluntary notification of Phthisis, in those districts where it had been adopted. The Public Health Committee carefully considered the report, and reported to the Council as follows:—" Since it is now certain that Consumption is an infectious disease and therefore preventable, we recognise that it is desirable (1) that patients so suffering should be notified to the Public Health Authority, (2) that they should be segregated for treatment, and (3) that after removal or death, the rooms occupied by them should be disinfected. " We recognise, however, that at present such methods of dealing with these patients are impossible, if compulsion is desired, and futile if left to voluntary action. Therefore, until such measures can be adopted, it is desirable that the 'health conscience' of the public in general, and more especially of the individual patients, should be educated, as to how they may aid themselves, and at the same time prevent danger to the health of others. '28 In the furtherance of this practicable object, we advise that pamphlets, which we have drafted, should be issued to : — (1) Medical men practising within the Borough. (2) The friends of those who have died from consumption. (3) Consumptive patients. (4) The Clergy and Visitors, the Registrars of Deaths, Guardians' Officials, Officers of Friendly Societies, the Coroner's Court, Post Offices, Public Dispensaries, Public Libraries, Museums, and Baths, the Police, etc. Finally, we believe (a) that consumptive patients who have been discharged from the hospitals as incurable should be visited from time to time to insure that all possible precautions are being adopted; (b) that public lectures by competent men, on the prevention of the spread of consumption, might lead to a much wider appreciation and application of the acknowledged facts of the case." These pamphlets were printed and distributed to those mentioned above. I.—Suggestions for the Guidance of Consumptive Patients. 1. In the early stages many cases of consumption are curable. 2. The disease is infectious. Careless habits are dangerous both for the patient himself and also to his friends. 3. It is certain that the phlegm coughed up by patients contains the living seeds of the disease. 4. Consumptive patients should not, when indoors, spit about the floor, but into special spitting cups (or pots) containing water. The spitting cups should be emptied into a bright fire, or into the water closet, but never anywhere else, and especially not into the dust heap. Out of doors, a pockethandkerchief may be used, but all handkerchiefs so soiled should be boiled for at least five minutes before being washed. 5. Sunlight and fresh air are the greatest enemies of infection by Consumption. The room in which a Consumptive patient lives by day, or by night, should be well aired, and the windows should be thrown wide open as soon as he leaves it. I he windows should always be kept a little open at the top, both by day or by night. The chimneys should not be stopped up. The floors of the rooms should be kept very clean, and great care should be taken that no dust remains upon them; they should be cleaned with a wet cloth and carbolic soap. 29 6. Consumptive patients should sleep by themselves. 7. Mothers who are consumptive should not suckle their children and should not themselves make use of the children's feeding bottles, cups, spoons, etc. 8. Over-fatigue, intemperance, bad air, dusty occupations and dark dirty rooms favour consumption. II.—Suggestions for those rvho live in a house where a Consumptive patient has died, or whence he has removed. 1. The rooms which have been occupied by consumptive people can be disinfected free of charge, on application to the Medical Officer of Health, 43, White Horse Street, Commercial Road, E. 2. Children recovering from Measles and Whooping Cough are very liable to catch Consumption unless they are specially cared for. 3. Should any other member of the household be noticed to be " declining," medical advice should be sought at once; delay may be dangerous and fatal. Homeless. 113 deaths occurred at the Whitechapel Infirmary and Workhouse, 13 at the Mile End Infirmary, and 6 at the St. George's Infirmary, among persons admitted from the streets without an address, or temporary lodgings of any kind. They were described as homeless. This number does not include those admitted from Common Lodging Houses, nor does it include those deaths that occurred at various Lunatic Asylums, where no addresses could be given. 110 such deaths occurred at the latter institutions, 33 stated to have been taken from the Limehouse District, 7 were said to belong to St. George's, 14 to Mile End Old Town, and 46 to Whitechapel. Appendicitis. 56 deaths occurred at the London Hospital during the year from Appendicitis, but 12 only belonged to this Borough. The remaining 44 were residents of neighbouring Boroughs. Two deaths occurred from the same disease at the East London Hospital for Women and Children, of which one belonged to this district. 30 There were in addition two deaths from the disease at the deceased s homes, and two occurred in Outlying Institutions. 17 residents therefore died from Appendicitis during the year. A few years ago the origin of Appendicitis was frequently attributed to the influence of foreign bodies, the seeds of various fruits being most frequently described. Now, however, it is generally recognised that in the majority of cases, Appendicitis is not associated with the presence of foreign bodies or concretions. The vermiform appendix is found only in man, the higher apes and the wombat, although in certain rodents a somewhat similar arrangement exists. It may at one time have some important function to perform, but at present it appears to be useless. It is admitted that those structures which remain to us as functionless vestiges of parts once useful in our prehistoric ancestors, are possessed of low vitality, and but feeble resistant powers. This doubtless partly explains the special susceptibility of the appendix to inflammation. In addition, its dependant position, its communication by an orifice—often more or less narrowed—with that portion of the bowels in which inspissation of the contents of the bowels first occurs, whilst at the same time it is removed from the direct currents in the bowels, all appear to be conditions favourable to inflammatory attacks. Deaths from Appendicitis from 1891 to 1905. Year. Deaths in Residents. London Hospital 1891 - 1 - 2 1892 - 1 - 2 1893 - 1 - 6 1894 - 6 - 12 1895 - 4 - 13 1896 - 5 - 11 189T - 5 - 17 1898 - 7 - 14 1899 10 - 27 1900 - 5 - 29 1901 15 - 34 1902 - 9 - 39 1903 15 - 49 1904 12 - 63 1905 17 - 56 31 It will be seen that the deaths from Appendicitis are on the increase. In the earlier of the above mentioned years, there were few deaths from Appendicitis recorded as such. Most of the deaths that I have included in those years were registered as Typhlitis and Perityphlitis. There was hardly a death recorded as Typhlitis or Perityphlitis in the latter years. It is only fair to assume that as the number of operations increase year by year, the case mortality should diminish. That is, if a certain number of operations from Appendicitis had been performed last year, there ought to have been fewer deaths than would occur when a similar number had been performed a few years ago. It is therefore apparent that a far larger number of persons actually suffer from Appendicitis than a few years ago. What is the cause of this apparent increase ? It is surely something in our mode of living, which was not present some years ago. Dr. Campbell Williams in the Clinical Journal of May, 1905, points out that the increase in the use of boracic acid as a food preservative may possibly account for the frequency of Appendicitis nowadays. This drug acts as an irritant of the gastro-intestinal tract, producing pain in the epigastrium and gas in the stomach ana intestines, together with colic and diarrhcea. Boracic acid also prevents the normal digesting action, performed in the gut by bacteria, especially in the large gut, and hence probably the Peyer's patches are diminished in functional size. These conditions may predispose to Appendicitis from invasion of the intestinal wall by the bacillus coli communis. It is undoubtedly true, as is seen in another part of this report, that Boracic acid is extensively added at the present time to the most frequently used of our foods. On the other hand, infants and young children drink large quantities of milk, which frequently contains Boracic acid, yet children under two years of age are practically exempt from the disease. Constipation, following the ingestion of too much cooked food, has also been suggested as a cause, and per contra, the consequent abuse of drastic purgatives. Both lead to abnormal lethargy and activity of the gut alternatively. 32 NUMBER OF ARTICLES DISINFECTED IN THE DISINFECTING APPARATUS. ARTICLES. January. February. March. April. May. June. July.

The number of bodies deposited in the mortuary during the year was 679. Of these, 609 were removed by order of the Coroner, 48 by the Police, 6 by Relieving Officers, 5 at the request of friends of the deceased, and 11 on my instructions. Nine of the latter had died from Infectious Diseases, and were placed in the Infectious mortuary. 652 inquests were held in the Coroner's Court, and 87 post-mortem examinations were made. Unsound Food. The quantity of unsound food destroyed during the year was only a little over a third of that destroyed in the previous year. Most of it was surrendered at the various wharves. In former years the greater part was destroyed by a contractor living out of the district. It was suggested at one of the meetings of the Public Health Committee that it might be possible for some of the unsound food to be taken elsewhere than to the place to be destroyed, and find its way back again to be offered for sale for human food. Personally, I do not think that this is possible. In order to allay any suspicion of this, I submitted the following plan to the Committee, which was adopted. These rules are rigidly applied to all unsound food that is surrendered or seized in our district:— 1. Whenever unsound food is to be removed to the Council's premises for destruction, the Wharf Inspector will notify the Borough Engineer of the fact. c 34 2. The Wharf Inspector shall visit the premises where the unsound food is to be destroyed, and see that all goods that were surrendered have been delivered. 3. The Borough Engineer will submit his accounts to the various wharfingers, which will be at the same rate as they have been in the habit of paying to the contractor, viz., 10s. per ton. 4. The Wharf Inspector, whenever possible, is to advise that the removal and destruction shall be done by the Council's employees. 5. Whenever tinned goods are removed to the Contractor's premises, the Wharf Inspector is to give information to the Medical Officer of Health, who will arrange for one of the disinfectors to visit these premises, and see the goods spiked. 6. The Wharf Inspector is to supply to the Medical Officer of Health the accounts of charges made by the contractor, which will be forwarded to the Borough Treasurer, prior to being submitted to the Public Health Committee for payment. 7. The Wharfingers, in addition to the above, are to be asked to notify the Medical Officer of Health, or the Wharf Inspector, when it is their intention to have tinned food removed and destroyed by the Contractor, stating the date and time of such proposed removal. 8. All other food stuffs are to be sprinkled with Carbolic powder, previous to removal. 9. All small quantities of unsound food brought to the office are to be deposited at the Disinfecting Station, and destroyed, if possible, at the Incinerator, which is in connection with the Disinfecting Station. The Contractor is also a soap boiler, and the fat extracted from the tinned meat is of commercial value to him. He pays 10s. for all tinned beef and mutton, as well as removing the goods free of charge. This is the reason that all unsound food is not destroyed by us, which would undoubtedly be more satisfactory. The amount destroyed by the Contractor was about 83 tons. The amount destroyed at the Incinerator was about 140 tons. The amount destroyed at the Destructor was about 9 tons. 35 The following unsound foods were destroyed during the year : — Apples 196 cases, 56 barrels, 131 tins. Apple Pulp 194—36-gai. casks.

Canal Boats entering the navigable waters within this Borough are inspected by a Sanitary Inspector under the Canal Boats Acts, 1877 and 1884. His inspections are in addition to the examinations I personally made, as Examining Officer for the purpose of registration. The number of boats inspected during the year 1905 was 23. The condition of the boats and their occupants, with regard to the matters dealt with in the Acts and Regulations, was very good. No infringements of the Acts and Regulations were discovered, consequently no legal proceedings were taken during the year. No infectious disease was notified as having occurred on any Canal Boat during the year. No boats were detained for the purpose of cleansing or disinfection. The number of Canal Boats on the register on the 31st December, 1905, was 69. One boat was registered during 1905. Annual Report of the Public Analyst. During the year 1905, 1176 samples were examined under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, consisting of 622 Milks, 279 Butters, 4 Margarines, 5 Cheeses, 4 Lards, 20 Cocoas, 53 Coffees, 5 Ground Gingers, 43 Mustards, 92 Peppers, 1 Malt Vinegar, 1 Vinegar, 3 Arrowroots, 10 Oatmeals, 2 Ground Rices, 1 Sago, 2 Wheat Flours, 5 Gins, 2 Rums, 9 Whiskies, 3 Demerara Sugars, 2 Almond Oils, 1 Camphorated Oil, 1 Nut Oil, 3 Olive Oils, 1 Powdered Rhubarb, 2 German Sausages. 187 Samples, or 15-9 per cent., were found to be adulterated. These consisted of 132 Milks, 49 Butters, 1 Margarine, 2 Cocoas, 1 Malt Vinegar, 1 Sago, 1 Demerara Sugar. Proceedings were taken in 76 cases. The two sam pies of German Sausages were examined solely for preservatives, and were found to contain Boron compounds equivalent to 10 grains and 4 grains of Boracic Acid per lb. respectively. 39 The quantities being small, no action was taken. One sample of Milk was examined unofficially. It was found to be genuine and of good quality. The total fines secured during the year amounted to £137 11s. 1d. The total costs allowed amounted to £71 9s. The average fine secured on the prosecutions was £1 16s. In addition, proceedings were taken against 6 Milkvendors for obstructing the Sanitary Inspectors in the execution of their duties. Fines were inflicted amounting to £18, and £6 18s. costs. Compared with the previous years the adulterations were as follows:— Year Number examined. Number adulterated. Number of prosecutions. Per cent, of adulteration. Per cent, of prosecutions. 1901 693 107 66 15.4 9.5 1902 1187 260 118 21.9 9.9 1903 1171 214 88 18.3 7.5 1904 1191 190 58 15.9 4.9 1905 1176 187 76 15.9 6.4 Formalin was detected in 7 samples of milk, and Boracic acid in 9. The quantity ranged from 5 to 20 grains per gallon of milk. No action was taken by the committee beyond cautioning the vendors. Boracic acid was detected in two samples of butter, to the amount of 45 and 60 grains per lb. The vendor of the latter was fined £3 and 23s. costs. Though the Royal Commission on Food Preservatives issued their report in 1901, no action has been taken by the Legislature to promote a bill on the lines indicated in that report. The Commission recommended that the use of formalin in foods or drinks be absolutely prohibited, and that any preservative or colouring matter in milk offered for sale, be constituted an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. That the only preservative permitted to be used in butter and margarine be boric acid or a mixture of boric acid and borax, to be used in proportions not exceding 5 per cent, expressed as boric acid. 40 Until a bill is passed as suggested in the report mentioned above, proceedings will be taken in very few instances, as the present method is most cumbersome. It is now necessary to prove to the satisfaction of the Magistrate that the amount discovered to be present in the articles is injurious to health. If the latter be disputed, it is possible that every case taken may prove a lengthy and expensive proceeding. The quantity of butter consumed daily varies from 1 to 2J ounces. The Boracic acid in the above case where proceeding were taken amounted to the large percentage of 11. The amount of Boracic acid consumed in 2J ounces of butter would be a little over 12 grains. A< cording to Dr. Wylie's report to the United States Board of Agriculture, experiments on the direct effect of boracic acid when administered in food, showed that taken in small quantities,—less than 7^ grains per day,—no noticeable effects are immediately produced. The symptons of the cases where small doses are given for a lengthened period, or larger doses extending over a shorter period, produce a feeling of fulness and uneasiness in the stomach. In some cases these symptons result in nausea, with a very general tendency to produce a sense of fulness in the head, often manifested as a dull and persistent headache. In addition to the above, there appear in some instances sharp and well located pains, which, however, are not persistent. After the withdrawal of the preservative the unpleasant sensations in the stomach and head disappear, although the feeling of depression persists for a more lengthened period. On the whole, Dr. Wylie's experiments showed that 8 grains per day are too ii uch for the average man to receive regularly. On the other hand, he can take ti e same quantity for a limited period of time without much danger of impairing his health. Boracic acid, therefore, when continuously administered in small doses for a long period, or when given in large doses for a short period, creates disturbances of appetite, of digestion, and of health generally. On this standard the amount of boracic acid in this butter was far above trie quantity that could be safely taken for a short period, even if no boracic acid was present in any other article of diet. When it is considered that this pieservative is present in milk, cream, ham, bacon, sausages, and certain beverages, the amount liable to be consumed daily becomes alarming. 41 Statistics of Adulterations for Year ending December, 1905.
