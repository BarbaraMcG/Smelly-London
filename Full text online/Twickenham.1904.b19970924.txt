TW 1040 1904. TWICKENHAM Urban District Council. ANNUAL REPORT of W. MARSTON CLARK, Diplomate in Public Health, Lond., Medical Officer of Health. twickenham: Printed by H. & C. Franklin, King Street, 1900. TW 1040 Twickenham Urban District Council. OF THE ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1904. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Twenty-first Annual Report as to the Health and Sanitary condition of the Parish of Twickenham. Appended to the Report are four tables received from the Local Government Board. Table I comprises the vital statistics of the whole district for 1904, and previous years extending from 1894. Table II consists of the Births and Deaths registered, and with a view to give more concise information, ruch table has been sub-divided corresponding with the four Wards of the District, viz.:—South, East, West and Central. I have estimated the population at 26,000, comprising 5,889 in the South Ward, 7,165 in the East Ward, 7,688 in the West Ward, and 5,258 in the Central Ward. Table III shews the cases of Infectious Diseases notified during the past year. Of the total cases 41 were in the South, 28 in the East, 56 in the West, and 29 in the Central Wards respectively. The removals to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, were 3 from the South Ward, 20 from the East Ward, 19 from the West Ward, and 13 from the Central Ward. 2 Table IV embraces the causes and ages at death for the same period. There were 319 deaths; of these 57 occurred in the South Ward, 63 in the East Ward, 132 in the West Ward and 67 in the Central. The compilation of the tables has necessitated very great care in order to ensure accuracy. In addition to the foregoing, there are four tables furnished by the Middlesex County Council, viz.Tables C (I, II, III, IV.) Tables C (I) refers to Inspections of Dwelling Houses, Houses let in separate Dwellings or Lodgings, Common Lodging Houses, Canal Boats used as Dwellings, Movable Dwellings, Caravans, Tents, &c. Inspections generally and notices served. Table C (II) contains the Inspection of Schools, Workshops, and Work-places, Laundries, Bakehouses, Slaughterhouses, Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops, Unsound Food, Adulterated Food, Offensive Trades and Mortuaries. Table C (III) relates to Water Supplyand Water Service, Closet-accommodation, Drains, Cesspools, Sewers and Ash-pits. Table C (IV) deals with Disinfection, Dust Collecting, Dampness, Contagious Diseases of animals, and sundry other nuisances, such as overcrowding, &c. Population. The Vital Statistics are calculated on an estimated population of 26,000. The population at the time of the Census of 1891 was 16,026, Census 1901, 20,991. As nearly as can be computed the number of inhabited houses is 5,500. Births. During the year there were 723 births, 354 were males, and 369 were females, giving a birth rate of 27.8 per 1000. The total number of births for 1899 was 521 1900 „ 531 1901 „ 576 1902 „ 596 1903 „ 615 3 Deaths. With an estimated increase of 4,000 in population since the Census of 1901, the number of deaths 324 is 70 in excess of last year. The death rate is at the average of 12.2 per 1,0C0 as against 10.5 per 1,000 in the preceding year. The number of deaths for 1899 was 276 equal to an average rate of 13'8 per 1,000 1900 „ 295 „ „ 14-3 „ 1901 „ 254 „ „ 12-9 ,, 1902 „ 204 „ „ 120 ,, 1903 „ 254 „ „ 10-5 ,, The epitome of the ages at death is as follows:— Under 1 year 109 Over 1 year and under 5 years 24 Over 5 years and under 15 years 8 Over 15 years and under 25 years 13 Over 25 years and under 65 years 89 65 years and upwards 81 Of the deaths registered in the district and as occurring among the residents of Twickenham, 81 exceeded 65 years of age. 13 were between the age of 65 and 70 years. 40 „ „ 70 „ 80 „ 23 „ „ 80 „ 90 „ 5 died at the advanced age of 90 years. The nonagenarians totalled a grand aggregate of 475 years, giving averages of 95 years respectively. Two uncertified deaths occurred, one of a male 22 years of age of hamiorrhage of the lungs, and a female 86 who died of senile decay. Amongst the deaths from all causes were 9 from Epidemic Influenza, 28 Diarrhoea, 16 from Phthisis, 20 from Cancer, 34 from Respiratory diseases, 29 from Heart Disease, 2 from Accidents, and 15 Premature Births, 4 Thirteen deaths occurred in St. John's Hospital; and one in the Infectious Diseases Hospital. The following table summarises the mortality from the principal Zymotic diseases occurring during the last 10 years. 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 Small Pox 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 Measles 3 1 0 15 0 8 2 8 1 2 Scarlet Fever 0 0 0 1 2 0 3 1 1 1 Diphtheria 2 4 4 2 6 3 3 3 3 2 Whooping Cough 0 6 8 9 3 7 9 9 10 13 Enteric Fever 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 5 12 14 27 11 19 19 22 15 20 Measles. I am pleased to observe that I have had no occasion to close any of the schools during the year under review. Small Pox. The question of combining with other Local Sanitary Authorities in the County for the provision of Hospitals for the accommodation of Small Pox patients has been under the further consideration of the Council, but they were of opinion that under existing circumstances it was inexpedient to become one of the constituent Authorities. Notifiable Diseases. 5 Subjoined is a table of the scheduled notifiable diseases, with the number of cases occurring in each year for the past 10 years. 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 Small Pox 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 Scarlet Fever 28 44 34 31 142 97 105 57 23 101 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 21 22 20 19 29 27 31 12 18 30 Typhus Fever 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Enteric or Typhoid Fever 12 12 11 6 9 6 9 9 3 7 Continued Fever 0 2 0 1 1 7 2 0 0 0 Relapsing Fever 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Puerperal Fever 2 4 4 0 0 4 2 2 0 2 Cholera 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 Erysipelas 15 25 7 8 11 12 10 4 4 8 78 109 77 65 194 153 159 94 48 148 Scarlet Fever. There were 101 cases of Scarlet Fever notified ; of these 37 took place in the South Ward, 24 in the East Ward, 23 in the West Ward, and 17 in the Central Ward. Infectious Diseases Hospital. Fifty-five cases of Scarlet Fever were admitted into the temporary hospital, the Council still continuing their tenancy of this building. Of the 55 cases, 19 were removed from the West Ward, 13 from the Central, 20 from the East, and 3 from the South. Nurse Quick performed her duties efficiently to the satisfaction 6 of myself, and to the best of my belief to all the other medical practitioners who had occasion to attend at the hospital. The parents of the children who were under treatment expressed their gratitude for the experienced services rendered. Inquests. During the past year 16 inquests have been held. The findings of the juries were as follows :— 5 Heart disease. 1 Decomposed, cause of death unknown. 1 Drowned accidentally. 1 Fractured skull, from a fall. 2 Apoplexy. 1 Measles and pneumonia. 1 Hæmorrhage. 1 From overlaying. 1 Suicide by shooting. 1 ,, „ cut throat. 1 „ „ hanging. Pleasure Grounds, Radnor House. A considerable improvement has been effected here by raising the levels, and the place particularly in summer became a very favourite resort, notwithstanding the fact that the whole of the contemplated improvements are still incomplete, but are rapidly approaching that stage. I hope during the ensuingsummer the turf will be laid, and paths made, as I feel persuaded that this Pleasure Ground will become the most popular and frequented one of the district, and an acquisition which will for all time be appreciated. Water Analyses. Sixteen samples of water drawn from wells were analysed and found to be good and fit for drinking and domestic purposes. Mortuary. There were 16 bodies received into this building during the year. 7 The Education Acts. I have periodically examined the public elementary schools in the district, and I am pleased to observe that great improvements have been made in the sanitary conveniences attached to these buildings. Some of the playgrounds have also been put into a much more satisfactory condition. The ventilation and heating of the buildings also have been carefully considered, and alterations effected much to the benefit of teachers and children. The new desks provided in some of the schools are not only an improvement for scholastic purposes but also for physical development of the scholars. Manual exercise if more extensively employed would also be beneficial. The new temporary public elementary school reflects much credit upon the Council as the Education Authority. Employment of Children Act, 1903. I understand that it is intended to make bye-laws in pursuance of this statute. These are in my opinion highly essential as there are many children who are now engaged in employment of "street hawking" or the delivery of milk and newspapers and running of errands, &c., which course should not be permitted to continue. A general bye-law throughout the county would perhaps be the most efficacious manner of dealing with the question. Factory and Workshops Acts, 1901. The total number of workshops as per register is 136, including 38 domestic workshops, 18 retail bakehouses, 32 laundries, 38 other workshops, not including 26 workplaces. With regard to cleanliness notices have been served under the Public Health Acts in respect of 14 workshops and 10 domestic workshops. In one case where no sanitary accommodation was provided for the persons employed notice was served to provide suitable and proper accommodation, and such notice was at once 8 complied with. In 12 cases existing sanitary arrangements have been improved, enlarged, repaired, ventilated, &c. At the 21 factories, strict attention has been paid to the cleanliness, and suitability of sanitary conveniences. In pursuance of Sections 107—115 which have reference to home work, I have received 3 lists representing 6 out-workers engaged in the making of wearing apparel. No case of infectious disease has occurred at the house of a notified home worker. Bakehouses. Three underground bakehouses have been improved as regards their light and ventilation and other sanitary arrangements. Certificates have been issued authorising the continuance of user of such buildings. There is one bakehouse which has not yet been made to comply with the requirements of the statute, but I understand steps to do so will be taken shortly. Inspection of the Parish. Over 424 houses have been inspected, followed in 1823 cases by re-inspections. The following is an analysis of the work accomplished:— Houses, Premises, &c., cleansed, repaired, whitewashed, &c. 285 „ Roofs repaired, &c. 139 „ Guttering and Rain pipes repaired, &c. 84 ,, Ventilation below floor provided 16 ,, Yards paved and drained 78 Foul ditches and stagnant water 2 Nuisances arising from Overcrowding 73 ,, ,, Smoke 14 ,, ,, Pigs, other Animals & Fowls 105 Other Nuisances not included in the above Water—Wells closed Nil. Water laid on to houses with no supply 27 Cisterns—New provided 69 Cleansed, repaired, covered, &c. 80 Flush to W.C.'s 106 9 Water-Closets—New constructed 15 New apparatus provided 77 Repaired, cleansed, &c. 139 Supplied with water or supply rendered efficient 123 Ventilated 7 Unsound Food—Articles seized 40 Disinfection—Rooms fumigated 64 Stripped and Cleansed 23 Drains—Examined, tested, exposed, &c 49 Unstopped, repaired, trapped, &c. 172 Waste pipes, rain pipes, &c., disconnected 35 Soil pipes and drains ventilated 54 Disconnecting Traps or Chamber inserted 35 Reconstructed 12 Relaid 42 Cesspools filled in 1 Cesspools cleaned out 2 Dust—Dustbins repaired 4 Number of complaints of non-removal 128 New Dustbins provided 89 Movable receptacles substituted for fixed 36 Statutory Orders issued 627 In addition to the foregoing, repeated inspections were made and work of whitewashing and cleansing executed in the following buildings:— Laundries 49 Slaughter Houses 10 Dairies and Milk-shops 36 Workshops and Workplaces 136 Bakehouses 18 Cowsheds 8 Housing of the Working Classes Acts. The Council had occasion to issue five notices upon owners of premises in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. Proceedings before the 10 Justices with a view to obtaining Closing Orders prohibiting the user of two houses were compelled to be taken. After two adjournments the owner agreed and subsequently carried out the requirements of the Council. The execution of the works materially improved the premises. In the other cases the respective owners carried out works as specified without recourse to proceedings. Some difficulty necessarily arises, where there are courts, alleys and squares in a district in obtaining desirable sanitary and requisite arrangements in the homes of the working classes. The properties thus situate have been from time to time under my careful observation. Bye-law Infringements. Several Owners of property erected buildings in the rear of their premises thereby curtailing the air space prescribed by ihe bye-laws. Notices were served calling upon such Owners to shew cause why such buildings should not be altered, removed, or pulled down. The Council were successful in inducing the Owners to remedy the causes of complaint. Defective and Epileptic Children Act. The Council have appointed me as the Medical Officer under the above Act, and the Board of Education approved of such appointment. I examined five children who were believed not to be imbeciles nor merely dull or backward, but defective, that is to say children by reason of mental or physical defect are incapable of receiving proper benefit from the education in the ordinary Public Elementary Schools, but not incapable by reason of such defect of receiving benefit in some special classes or schools. After carefully examining the children and interviewing the parents and teachers and in consultation with H.M. Inspector, I arrived at the conclusion that all five cases came within the terms of the statute. It must not be forgotten that by "feeble minded" it is meant those who cannot be certified as being idiots or imbeciles, but who are so ill-equipped mentally as to be unable to take an independent place in the world. 11 Shop Hours Act, 1904. The powers which this statute conferred upon the Council have already been reported upon by the Clerk. It would appear that any initiative step must emanate from traders who must satisfy the Council that there is a prima facia case for a closing order. There does not appear at present any movement in the district in respect to the matter. Alkali, &c. Works Regulation Act. The question of the establishment of a business or works authorised by this statute, or whether the owner of certain premises was establishing a "noxious or offensive" trade caused considerable trouble. After inspecting the premises in question on several occasions and conferring with the County Medical Officer of Health a doubt existed whether the business was an offence under the above statute, or even under the first section of the Public Health Act, 1875, which has reference to "noxious or offensive trades." I reported to the Health Committee that continued observations could only enable the Council to arrive at any conclusive decision upon the question at issue. This course was adopted. Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, 1904. This Act came into operation in October last. The expression in the statute of "local authority" includes an urban district with a population according to the census of 1901 of over 20,000, and expenses incurred by a local authority in administering the Act maybe defrayed out of the Council's fund. The Guardians have however, powers dealing with the offences prescribed by this and other statutes, so it may be inad visable generally for the Council to apply provisions of the Act as overlapping may ensue. Diseases of Animals Acts. Swine Fever. The Secretary's letter from the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries respecting this matter has received consideration and attention. 12 Wild Birds Protection Act, 1904. Although this Act may not be administered by the Council nor its officials too much publicity cannot be given to the provisions of the Act, which penalises a person who affixes, places or sets any spring trap, gun, or other similar instrument for catching "wild birds," which term appears to mean all wild birds. Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890. One application was made under Section 26 of the above Act by which exemption can be claimed from Inhabited House Duty. Upon the premises being inspected and found to be so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons dwelling therein, and that due provision be made for their sanitary requirements, a certificate may be issued. The property in question was duly inspected, and having reported the condition to my Health Committee, I was unable to grant the desired certificate. Sewers and New Streets. I am indebted to the courtesy of the Surveyor to the Council for the following particulars:— Plans of houses approved (excluding those known to be abandoned) 413 Plans for alterations and additions to existing buildings 18 Houses connected to soil sewers 361 Houses connected to surface water sewers 342 The following new streets have been made up under the provisions of the Private Street Works Act, 1892:—Cornwall Road, Napoleon Road, Crane Road, Gould Road and Gravel Road. The number of yards of new sewers constructed 2358 Number of yards of surface water sewers constructed 2904 New manholes constructed 76 13 Sewers have been laid in the following roads:— Kenley Road, Godstone Road, Alfgar Road, Hartington Road, Copthall Gardens, Chudleigh Road, Palmerston Road, Russell Road, Grove Avenue, Rowntree Road, London Road, Ivy Road and Cole Park Road. In conclusion I have to remark that from a sanitary point of view the health of the parish has been most satisfactory. The work occasioned by the increase in population, has been well performed by the Sanitary Inspectors. My personal thanks are due to the Health Committee and Council for the support accorded me in all matters affecting my department. I have the honour to be, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. MARSTON CLARK, Diplomate in Public Health, London. Medical Officer of Health. TABLE I.
