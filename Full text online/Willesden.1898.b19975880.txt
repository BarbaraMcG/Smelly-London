Gentlemen, I beg to present my Report of the working of the hospital during the year 1898. There were 71 patients remaining in hospital at the commencement of the year, 49 suffering from scarlet fever, and 22 from diphtheria; of the latter number 16 were under treatment at Stonebridge Farm There have been 487 cases admitted, exactly the same number as in the previous year; there have been consequently 558 patients under treatment, an average of 60 every day.

In 1895 and in 1896, out of every 1,000 of the population 4.3 each year were admitted to the hospital; in 1897 the proportion was 5.0, in 1898 it has been rather lower, 4.7. Of Scarlet Fever alone, the proportion in 1896, was 3.3; in 1897, 3.5; in the present year, 2.2. Of Diphtheria in 1896 it was 0.6; in 1897, 1.4; in 1898, 2.2 per 1,000. (7) The admissions during the last three years have been as follows :— 1896. 1897. 1898. Scarlet Fever 296 329 223 Diphtheria 53 137 221 Typhoid 5 16 38 Other Diseases 16 5 5 370 487 487 Since the opening of the permanent buildings in the Autumn of 1894 there have been 1,722 cases admitted, and since the opening of the original iron building there have been 1,970. Stonebridge Farm was occupied altogether four months, during which time 64 cases were admitted there; the building of course was only intended as a temporary resource and gradually became so much in want of disinfecting that it was a necessity to give up admitting cases. Unfortunately the type of cases was, at the latter part of the time, of such a malignant character that death took place before the treatment adopted had time to exercise any effect. I was more than ever impressed with the absolute necessity that exists for any hope of success in the treatment of this disease that there shall be good superficial space as well as cubic area; free ventilation of the Wards or rooms where the patients are. The air of the rooms was endeavoured to be purified as much as possible (8) by vaporising disinfectants repeatedly and by open windows. After the building had been given up the rooms were thoroughly disinfected, the walls stripped and cleansed. It was subsequently occupied by a family with several children but no illness of a diphtheritic character has appeared among them. The Registrar-General in his instructions in connection with calculating averages in such Institutions directs that the deaths, multiplied by 100, should be divided by half the total of admissions, discharges, and deaths. This apparently takes no notice of the patients remaining in hospital from the previous year. Excluding these latter and two deaths, the death rate for the year calculated on the above plan was 11.9 per cent., but calculating the total deaths, 61, by the total under treatment, 558, the death rate was 10.9 per cent. The following figures give the rate per cent. of cases admitted for the different diseases in 1896. 1897. 1898. Scarlet Fever 4.0 2.7 3.3 Diphtheria 22.6 24.8 19.3 Typhoid Fever 60.0 12.5 10.5 All causes 8.1 9.2 10.9 SCARLET FEVER. The death rate of Scarlet Fever was a mean between the two previous years. (9) Although there were far fewer cases admitted there were many serious complications and subsequent effects. Seven were found to be suffering from Diphtheria; four had Chicken Pox ; two Measles ; two Whooping Cough. There were fewer cases of Post-Scarlatinal Diphtheria, only two having occurred, I am of opinion that having fewer cases and consequently more space has contributed to this result; Rheumatism occurred in six cases one being a very severe attack of Rheumatic Fever. Five children also suffered from a mild form of Typhoid Fever; I made an investigation into the circumstance and could not trace the disease to any outside influence ; it was after very hot weather when the ground very dry and cracked; an outbreak occurred in a house not far from the hospital grounds at the same time. Cases of severe Kidney affection have been few, and though evidence of Albumen in the Urine was detected in a great many cases, two only developed into a very serious condition; they eventually recovered. DIPHTHERIA. Diphtheria, not withstanding the number of deaths in the early part of the year, had a more (10) favourable rate than before, the number of cases under treatment being many more. ANTITOXIN SERUM. In the treatment of this disease I have made great use of the Antitoxin Serum, being confirmed in the opinion of its value. 67.8 per cent. of the cases were treated with it, a total of 150 out of the 221 admitted. The following table gives some details with regard to ages. Under 1 year. From 1 to 2 years. From 2 to 6 years. From 6 to 10 years. Over 10 years. Total. Males 1 7 24 27 9 68 Females 0 4 20 35 23 82 Total l 11 44 62 32 150 Recovered— Males l 4 14 23 8 50 Females 0 3 16 25 20 64 Total 1 7 30 48 28 114 Died— Males 0 3 10 4 1 18 Females. 0 1 4 10 3 18 Total 0 4 14 14 4 36 The death rate was higher among males 26.4 per cent. than females 21.9. The early use of the Serum is most important; it (11) is very desirable to use it even in mild cases before any membrane becomes visible, if there is a history of a previous case to confirm the diagnosis, without Bacteriological examination. I have had reason to regret not having used it at once, in cases that have been of a very mild character the progress towards recovery being much slower. In post-nasal cases where the throat at first may show very little affection, I consider the Serum should be used as soon as possible as it is extremely likely there may be membrane at the back of the Nose which is not visible. Cases which have appeared on first examination to be absolutely hopeless, the throat and palate being covered with membrane and the nose blocked, have recovered with the use of Serum. Life undoubtedly was prolonged in some, and consequently there are a large number of cases, 44, of Paralysis; the patients may get over the primary attack, the throat and nose having recovered quite the normal healthy appearance, but succumb to paralysis and heart failure. Paralysis may supervene on mild cases, and may affect the sight, the power of swallowing, the voice, the heart, the limbs; the muscles of the body may be so weakened as to be quite unable to support the head; the disease need not be confined to one of the above only, but three or four may gradually follow in succession. The length of time that may elapse before the paralysis shows itself is uncertain, and the duration, before recovery is complete, may be months. ( 12) CASES OF DIPHTHERIA TREATED WITHOUT SERUM. Under 1 year. From 1 to 2 years. From 2 to 5 years. From 5 to 10 years. Above 10 years. Total. Males 2 3 10 11 10 36 Females 0 2 12 11 10 35 Total 2 5 22 22 20 71 Recovered.— Males - 2 10 9 10 31 Females - 2 9 9 10 30 Total 4 19 18 20 61 Died.— Males 2 1 0 2 — 5 Females 0 0 3 2 — 5 Total 2 1 3 4 10 The death rate among these was lower, 14.08 per cent., than the others, as might be expected. Two were operated upon immediately on admission as a last resource, but without success. Five died within 24 hours of admission. There were 10 cases of Paralysis, of whom 3 died. In 17 cases out of the 221 the disease was found to be complicated with Scarlet Fever, in some cases the rash appearing within a day or two, in others shown later on by desquamation. Other complications were Rheumatism, Typhoid Fever, Hœmorrhage, Water on the Brain, Diarrhœa, and Pneumonia. (13) TRACHæOTOMY. This operation was performed 7 times, of whom 4 recovered; two children were of one family, and both recovered. TYPHOID EEYER. There were many more cases of this disease than we have had before and I deeply regret to have to record the deaths of two nurses ; five of the staff were attacked. The first case occurred in a nurse who was taken on the staff, commencing her duties on a Sunday morning, the following Saturday she was admitted into the ward, with severe symptoms of the disease; it was then found that during the few days she was on duty she was suffering from diarrhoea, but made no complaint. She died after three weeks' illness. Subsequently two nurses, one wardmaid, and one laundry-maid took it; one nurse recovered, but Nurse Jackson, to my sincere regret—she having been at the Hospital for four years—died from perforation of the intestine. Several cases were admitted from one house. It was a question whether a patient suffering from pneumonia may not also have had typhoid, the latter symptoms being masked by the severe nature of the former. Severe pneumonia occurred as a secondary I have found the examinations of the greatest interest and value. It occasionally happens that a case presents some doubt, and, if on examination, the diphtheria bacillus should not be found, precaution can be taken to separate the patient as much as possible, and on subsequent examinations, if found free, (14) disease in some of the cases. One case sent in as typhoid, but which proved to be blood poisoning, is not included, and is returned under the head of other diseases; it was fatal, and the post-mortem examination revealed severe inflamation of the surface of the heart, pleurisy and peritonitis, but no lesions affecting the interior of the intestines, the mucous membrane appearing quite healthy. BACTERIOLOGY. Feeling the great importance and the advantage it would be to be able to make bacteriological examinations of the mucous from the throat, I received sanction from the Council to purchase the necessary appliances. £ s. d. Microscope with 1/12 oil immersion lens 20 12 6 Incubator 6 10 0 Sterilizer 3 0 0 Fittings, etc. 4 4 6 £34 7 0 ( 15) can be discharged. In this way it has been found possible to discharge patients earlier than would otherwise have been the case. I have received specimens from the throat forwarded by Medical men, and on some occasions have at once on examination found the bacillus present, the examination takes but a short time, in other cases it has been found necessary to place the specimen under cultivation before being able to decide, which takes about 24 hours. I have prepared sterilized swabs in test tubes enclosed in wooden boxes and envelopes so as to be forwarded by post; these can be had at the hospital or the offices in Dyne Road. The preparation of the material for cultivating the growth of the microbes in the Incubator is a very important point and requires the greatest care and nicety. I was fortunate in obtaining an introduction to Drs. Dean and Salter, of the branch of the Institute of Preventive Medicine, where the Antitoxin Serum and the many various media necessary for use in the cultivation of the different Bacilli are prepared. I have received much valuable information from them which has been of great help to me in studying the processes necessary for the due microsocopical examination of the various microbes to be met with; they (16) most kindly offered to supply me with the two media specially recommended for the cultivations I required to make and I feel greatly indebted to them. No doubt it will be understood by the Council that these scientific investigations are of comparatively recent discovery, and therefore any assistance given to me in perfecting my knowledge was most acceptable and deserves my sincerest thanks. The importance of these examinations will be apparent and will be of the greatest assistance, not only to me at the hospital, but throughout the district. EXPENSES. The great increase in the supply of water is in part due to a different arrangement of the apportionment by meter, the amount of the charge having been too little in the previous years; but it is also due to the frequency with which the automatic flushing cisterns at the head of the drains discharge themselves in the 24 hours; it had been found that the drains were liable to become choked and the cisterns were consequently set to empty much more frequently; there are 7 of them and they each contain 200 gallons. I found by measuring the quantity of water flowing in, that one cistern would discharge between every three and four hours ; the others were not set to go off so frequently.

The amounts received from other Sanitary authorities for patients taken at their requests were—Acton, £257 17s. 0d.; Chiswick, £24 6s. 0d.; Wembley, £57 3s. 0d.; total, £339 6s. 0d. This might have been increased as patients had to be refused for want of space. The sum of £1 0s. 6d. was received for the use of the ambulance in conveying patients suffering from other infectious diseases not admitted to the hospital, to other places. The expenditure under Land, Interest, &c., includes interest on loan for the purchase, in lieu of rental, of the remaining portion of the hospital ground, which now consists of 8 acres. The expenses of the staff, provision and other general details remain very nearly the same. The average weekly cost for each patient during the year was 5s. 2d., which was precisely the same as last year, for the staff 8s. 2½d., which is rather less. Including the 71 remaining in hospital at the beginning of the year, the actual cost of the provisions divided among the 558 patients comes to £2 12s. 8½d. In 1897 it was £2 15s. 0d. In 1896 £3 5s. 0d. HOSPITAL STAFF. This has consisted for most of the year of Medical Superintendent, Matron, Steward, four charge nurses, (five for a portion of the time) two assistant (18 ) Nurses, and seven Probationers, a Seamstress and an assistant, 12 subordinate female staff, including laundry maids; Coachman,Porter (who attends also to the Steam apparatus for the Laundry and Disinfector). Steam is used for heating the water in the Laundry, not for machinery. There are also two lads to assist in the Laundry and in the house. There have been several changes in the nursing staff, three have left and taken up superior positions in other Fever hospitals. I desire to express my acknowledgements of the valuable and willing assistance I have received from the Matron and Steward, and Nurses in carrying on the important duties in the Ward. PROPOSED EXTENSION. In my Sanitary and Hospital Reports for 1897, I drew attention to the need for increased accommodation. A resolution was passed by the Council that Mr. Robson, the Engineer, should make a report on the subject according to the requirements of the Sanitary Committee, &c. The proposed extension included.— Enlargement of Administration Block. One Storey Pavilion. Two Storey Pavilion. Laundry including Machinery. Extension of roads and some details. (19) This increase would provide 56 beds for patients bringing up the total number of beds in permanent buildings to 98. It provided greatly improved sleeping accommodation for nurses. The cost of the whole was estimated at £29,672 17s. 0d. In the following month the Council passed a resolution agreeing for the present to a much modified plan, consisting of an annexe for the nurses, and the two storey pavilion and the minor details at an estimated cost of £14,351 13s. 0d.* I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, D. S. SKINNER, Medical Superintendent. *A resolution has since been passed approving of the original plans for the extension. WILLESDEN Urban District Counicl. SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1898, BY D.

Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my tenth Annual Report giving the statistics and general sanitary condition of the District during the year 1898. METEOROLOGY. In the first quarter the temperature was 2.6 degrees above the average. January was mild, 6.9 degrees above the usual. The rainfall was below the average by 1.71 inches. In the second quarter the temperature was identical with the average, the rainfall being slightly below. In the third quarter the temperature was above the average, though it was slightly below in July, but 3.7 in August and 5.5 in September above. The rainfall was much below; the total for the 12 months ending September being only 14.76 inches, which is about ten inches less than the average annual fall. The three months were noticeable for the amount of sunshine, (6) In the fourth quarter the temperature was above the average; the rainfall for the first time being above the average, but leaving a large deficit on the year. Although there was a good deal of rain, the amount of sunshine proved to be again above the average. In the first quarter the deaths from specific Febrile or Zymotic diseases and Respiratory diseases were high. In the second and fourth quarters the climatic conditions being more nearly in accordance with what usually prevails. The number of deaths being below the average 249 and 250 respectively. In the third quarter Infantile Diarrhoea was prevalent, as is usually the case during hot weather. THE DISTRICT AND WARDS. The District is situate on the north-western border of the Metropolis, and is somewhat triangular in outline. The southern boundary extends from Maida Yale, Edgware Road on the east to parish of Twyford on the west, a linear distance of about 4 miles. It abuts in its course the parishes of Paddington, Chelsea (detached), Kensington, Hammersmith, and Acton. (7) The north-western boundary is the River Brent and Twyford parish, a linear distance of about 3½ miles. The north-eastern boundary is the main road from London to Edgware from a point nearly 300 yds. below the London and North-Western Railway, known as Kilburn Gate, to the Welsh Harp Reservoir at Hendon, a distance of over 3 miles. SEWERAGE. The drainage of the southern part of the District which passes into the Metropolitan system has not undergone any change. The works connected with the Brent area on the northern side of the ridge dividing the two areas have been completed. The works consist of 121 acres, and are now under the inspection of the County Council as well as the Thames Conservancy. All analyses of the effluents have been satisfactory. The treatment is triple throughout. Chemical before passing into the depositing tanks; artificial filtration through beds of Polarite; intermittent downward filtration and irrigation. The bed of the river Brent is being levelled, which will be of great advantage. WATER SUPPLY. In my report of previous years, I have called attention to the inadequate supply of water in South Kilburn, which chiefly consists of houses let in tenements. (8) This has now been ameliorated to a great extent. The West Middlesex Water Company had expressed their willingness to give a constant supply, but difficulties were experienced in enforcing the provisions of the necessary fittings. Prior to the passing of the Metropolis Water Act, 1897, the Company were only empowered to enforce the necessary alterations of fittings in the Metropolis; but by the passing of the above Act they are now enabled to extend that power to the area within which they are authorised to supply water. The Kilburn district has been scheduled in separate areas, and the most populated parts are now in the enjoyment of a constant supply of water. The other portions of the District will in due time receive the same attention. The retention of the Storage Cistern is an indispensable condition which should be enforced in all cases, as the closing of the mains when repairs or other circumstances require it does not then inconvenience or cause annoyance to the occupants of the houses. The limiting of a 2-gallon flushing cistern is in my opinion a serious mistake, as in a number of instances it has not had the required result in effectually cleansing the W.C. (9) The two gallons of water discharged into the drain is not of sufficient force to keep the obstructions constantly moving, and when the water reaches the intercepting trap, it has lost all its power, and is of no utility to cleanse the trap, allowing the foecal matter to remain putrid, giving off foul and offensive odours, which are eventually discharged into the open air through the fresh air inlet, causing a serious nuisance. There is one point in connection with water supply which is of great importance. The cisterns are often placed in an inaccessible position, so that it is almost impossible to get at them for inspection or for cleansing; they are generally too small, so that under any extra drain upon them the supply fails, and it is most important that they should be so placed as to be easily cleansed, should be provided with properly constructed and fitting covers, so that insects, birds, and animals should not be able to get into them. Instances have come under my notice where the cisterns have been repeatedly fouled by black beetles within a very short time of being cleansed. OPEN SPACES. Queen's Park is much used by children for cricket and games; it is 30 acres in extent, is (10) gradually getting more and more surrounded by houses, and therefore more and more valuable as a breathing space. Roundwood Park is 26¼ acres in extent, and much used as a promenade. The view from the Mound is extensive and fine; the air fresh and exhilarating. NEW HOUSES. In different parts of the district plans for laying out new building estates have been approved, and are being rapidly developed, and covered with houses. During the year 1498 plans for new houses were approved as having complied with the Bye-laws. All buildings in course of construction are kept under the continual observation of the Building Inspectors, and the drainage is tested with the water test before being covered up. EXEMPTION FROM INCOME-TAX. I have been requested on various occasions by landlords to visit houses occupied by two or more families with a view to giving a certificate so that they may be exempt from Inhabited House Duty under Section 26 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890, On several occasions I have been unable (11) to give the Certificate, although the houses are new, because of the smallness of the cisterns; under certain conditions the water supply fails for several hours, the closets consequently cannot be flushed, and thus become offensive. I have found that two families having separate and suitable accommodation are supplied from one cistern which has not been large enough for the requirements of one family; I also cannot see my way to certifying that "due provision is made for their sanitary requirements" when the water waste preventer contains frequently less than a two-gallon flush although supposed to hold the two gallons.

It will be seen from tables one and two that the population is estimated to have increased during the twelve months from Midsummer, 1897, to Midsummer, 1898, from 92,605, to 99,180, an increase of 6,575 altogether. In the Metropolitan area 3,191, in the Brent 3,384, so that both are progressing at nearly the same rate. (14) In addition, however, to the total of 99,180 there have to be added 402 people belonging to the District, but living outside it; in the Hendon Union Workhouse:— Males 58 Females 101 Children under 5 years of age 17=176 In the Hendon Union Schools:— Boys 46 Girls 22 Women 2= 70 In the County Asylum:— Males 63 Females 93=156 Total 402 which raise the population to a total of 99,582. These figures show that the pauperism has remained the same rate as last year, and lunacy the same, there being an increase of 13 in the Asylum. Although the Parish has been a separate Poor Law District for some time the Workhouse and Infirmary have not yet been built. (15) TABLE No. 3. MARRIAGES. 1698. First Quarter. Second Quarter.

The number of marriages solemnized were 89 more than during the previous year, being an increase in the rate from 4.7 in 1897 to 5.3 in 1898. The birth-rate has also slightly increased which seems to indicate, as far as the parish of Willesden is concerned, that the report of the Registrar-General, of the slow but gradual decline of the marriage and birth-rates in the Kingdom generally, is not occurring here, and also indicates that the general prosperity of the District has been rather more than maintained. (17) BIRTHS. The births registered in the year were 3,142, including 17 which occurred in the Workhouse, giving a rate per 1,000 of 31.5, but that does not apparently represent the actual total, as from information obtained at Queen Charlotte's Lying-in-Hospital, it appears that 28 married women went from Willesden for their confinements, besides 63 single women. ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS. These occurring and registered in the parish were 63:—boys 33, girls 30, being 2.0 per cent. of the total births. DEATHS. The deaths registered in the District were 1,197 —Males 570, Females 627. This would give an average per 1,000 of 12.06, which is rather more favourable than last year and the year before. There have been many deaths of Willesden people occurring outside the District which have to be added. The number, as nearly as can be ascertained, is 200; of these, 60 occurred at the Hendon Union, 21 at Asylums, and 119 in the various London Hospitals. There were 9 deaths known to have occurred in the (18) District of people not belonging to it, which leaves 191 to be added to the 1,197, making a total of 1,388, and giving an average of 13.93 on the whole population of 99,582. The death rate for England and Wales was 17.7. The comparison of the death rates of various Districts is of little value unless the whole circumstances of each are known. Districts having low birth rates will have also low death rates. A birth rate of 20 per 1,000 probably means a class of population who marry much later in life than the operative class of a large manufacturing town, a difference in the mode of life where the mothers are able to look to the care of the children themselves, instead of leaving them to the care of others while they go to work in factories. The deaths from the seven zymotic diseases were 252, which is less than last year and the year before. The averages for the last ten years will be seen in Table 9. With the exception of diarrhoea the numbers decreased from quarter to quarter. The deaths that occurred in the Metropolitan Hospitals were 119, from the following causes:— (19) Scarlet Fever 1 Enteric Fever 1 Diphtheria 3 Consumption 19 Bronchitis and Pneumonia 11 Heart Disease 9 Suicide 1 Accidents 17 Various Diseases 57 119 INFANT DEATHS. These numbered 427, a decrease in the two previous years, the number in 1897 being 444, and in 1896, 460. The rate was 13.6 per cent. of the births, and 36 per cent. of the deaths. Of children under 5 years of age the total deaths were 626, giving a rate of 52.2 per cent. of the total deaths. ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. The number of illegitimate children that died was 29. Although shewing a very high rate of mortality compared to the general infant death rate, it was very much less than the average of the previous four years. Born. Died. Average per cent. Certified.

Of the other 26, the causes were: Bronchitis 2, Consumption 4, Diarrhoea 11, Debility 7. DEATHS NOT CERTIFIED. There were 28 deaths not certified, and in which no inquests were held. Under 1 year 10 From 1 to 5 3 From 5 to 65 8 Above 65 7 When an uncertified death is sought to be registered, information is given by the Registrar to the Coroner, who decides whether an Inquest is to be held. I again made application to the Secretary of Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Charity, and having received permission to count the number of cases, the following information was obtained as to the number of women who went from the Parish to be confined. From a Home in Kilburn 30 From a small branch of Queen Charlotte's 13 Various Addresses 48 Total 91 A smaller number than the year before. As before stated there were 28 married women. (21) SCHOOLS. Owing to outbreaks of diphtheria in private schools, I drew attention to the importance of having the right to inspect them. A communication was made by the Council to the Local Government Board on the subject, and a reply received to the effect that the point might be introduced into a future Bill amending or consolidating the Public Health Acts. I think it very desirable that such should be done. INQUESTS. Forty-six inquests have been held, the verdicts being:— Natural Causes 22 Accidents 11 Suicide 8 Wilful Neglect at Birth 1 Newly Born 2 Murder 1 Starvation 1 46 Knocked down on Railings 3 Run over in Streets 4 Overlaying 4 Were some of the causes.

It will be seen from the above that the number remaining unvaccinated has increased by more than double—64 per cent. were vaccinated in 1897, but 46 per cent. in 1898. These figures mean a very serious condition when the inevitable outbreak of Small Pox takes place. I would seriously draw the attention of the Council to the fact that at present there are no means of isolating any case that may arise, and that it would not be possible to erect any temporary accommodation on any part of the ground of the Isolation Hospital.

(28) From the above table of Notifications it will be seen that the cases have not been so numerous as last year by more than a hundred. One case was notified as Small Pox but it proved subsequently not to be so. Scarlet Fever has not been nearly as prevalent. Of the five years referred to in the table only one year, 1894, had a smaller number; in 1896 and 1897 the numbers were much higher. As will be seen by a reference to Table 10 there has been no special prevalence in any "Ward. Diphtheria has exhibited a very marked increase having been more especially prevalent in Harlesden, Kensal, and Kilburn. There have been outbreaks connected with school attendance. In one instance in a private school nine cases suddenly occurred, the school was at once closed and the outbreak ceased. I have given instructions that the house drains in roads where Diphtheria is notified should be flushed, as it frequently happens that the trap at the lower part of the drains before entering the sewer becomes blocked and consequently giving off foul gases. Of the 333 cases notified 217 were removed to the hospital, many of them in the early part of the year were of such a severe type that no treatment had any influence upon them; this will be more fully entered into in the Hospital Report. (29) BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. In consequence of a suggestion by a member of the Council that facilities should be given for a Bacteriological Examination of the throat in doubtful cases, the Council supplied the necessary apparatus at the Hospital, and 1 have found it of the greatest assistance. Several specimens have been forwarded and where the examination has proved the existence of the Bacillus the case has been put under treatment at once, the early treatment being most important. I have also found it of great assistance in cases that have been under treatment in the Hospital in deciding whether the throat is free and the patient ready for discharge. Diarrhœa.—There was the usual prevalence of this illness during the hot weather of the Summer, but not quite to the extent of the year before. The return of hot weather in September caused the continuance of the illness to a later date than usual, the severity having much mitigated at the end of August. Measles, Whooping Cough, Chicken Pox and Mumps.—As these diseases, although of a very highly infectious nature at the onset of the illness, are not required to be notified, and yet early information of them being very desirable, I endeavoured to make use of the Education Code to obtain that object. Section 101* of the Code refers to "epidemic grant" as follows.— ( 30) "Where the Department are satisfied that by reason of a notice of the Sanitary Authority under Article 88, or any provision of an Act of Parliament, requiring the exclusion of certain children, or by reason of the exclusion under medical advice of children from infected houses, the average attendance has been seriously diminished, and that consequently a loss of annual grant would, but for this article, be incurred, the Department have power to make a special grant not exceeding the amount of such loss in addition to the ordinary grant." Under this article it would be practical for the Medical Officer of Health, on receiving a notice from a School that certain children were absent from infectious diseases, on satisfying himself that such was the case, to give a certificate so that the school authorities might receive the grant without the school being closed by the Sanitary Authority. To enable the Medical Officer to give such a certificate it would be necessary for the school teachers to send a weekly return of the children absent, and I have prepared a form to be supplied to the head teacher of the various elementary schools. I am in hopes that the plan may be made to work as it would be of mutual advantage, and am glad to say the School Board have expressed a wish that it should be carried out. (31 ) DISINFECTIONS. The fumigating of rooms, in which have occurred cases of Zymotic Disease, is executed by the Council's workmen, two men being specially engaged for that purpose, and to assist in the testing and examining of drains. Over 800 rooms were fumigated, self-consuming sulphur candles being used. In a great number of cases the rooms were stripped, cleansed and whitewashed after service of notice under Sec. 46 Public Health Act, 1875. The bedding and articles exposed to infection after being fumigated by the above process, are moved in a closed van to the Council's Isolation Hospital, and purified in a special apparatus by super-heated steam. In instances where the bedding is in such a foul and dilapidated condition as to be unfit for use, I have given instructions to have it destroyed and provided new in lieu of same. The total cost of same was as under:— £ s. d. Fumigating of Rooms 122 5 8 Cost of Disinfecting and Destroying of Bedding, etc. 163 19 0 Total £286 4 8 In cases of Infectious Disease which have proved fatal at home, and the family have been unable to (32) effectually isolate the body, instructions have been given to the undertaker in charge to remove the corpse without delay to the Infectious Disease Mortuary to await burial. RETURN CASES OF SCARLET FEVER. The question of Return Cases presents very many points of great difficulty in considering it. In the first place the actual cause of Scarlet Fever is not yet definitely known, and its means of propagation arc still the subject of enquiry. "It is impossible to say, with our present ignorance of the cause of Scarlet Fever, in what part of the body the infection lingers; perhaps in the nasal, buccal, or pharyngeal mucous membrane, perhaps in the skin." (See Goodall and Washbourne's Manual of Infectious Diseases, page 90). From the above quotation it will be seen how difficult it is to say how the disease spreads; it may be in several ways, from person to person, by discharges from a patient, "infected garments that have been put away for months have been known to originate an outbreak;" it is absolutely uncertain how long the breath of a patient may remain in an infected condition. Infection begins at the earliest period of an attack, and is greatest when the fever is at the highest. The question is one that is engaging attention all over the Country; it is not only in our own parish that (33) such cases are liable to occur, but there is not an Infectious Diseases Hospital in the Country, where the population is large enough to cause a continuous succession of cases, that the same thing does not occur. Un referring to the work on Infectious Diseases already quoted, at page 60 will be found this statement,—" The Incubation period is invariably less than a week, and is usually only three days." The average length of time each patient is in Hospital is about eight weeks, and the average number of return cases has been less than 2 per cent. on 223 admissions. ISOLATION HOSPITAL. At the commencement of the year Stonebridge Farm was still being used as an auxiliary to the hospital for the accommodation of Diphtheria patients. Not having been constructed for such a purpose it gradully became impregnated with the germs, and unsuitable for the purpose; I was very glad consequently to be able to vacate the building and accommodate the Diphtheria patients in one of the Hospital blocks. I was enabled to do this owing to a decrease in the number of Scarlet Fever patients. The block was disinfected and thoroughly cleansed, and I am glad to say no Scarlet Fever manifested itself after the Diphtheria patients were received into it. (34) Stonebridge Farm was vacated in February, was twice disinfected, the walls stripped and cleansed; when subsequently occupied by a family no Diphtheria occurred among them. In July the Council passed a resolution to enlarge the Hospital by the addition of an Annexe to the Administration Block for sleeping-quarters for the Nurses and a two-story Hospital Block. ENTERIC FEVER. In the early part of the year there were very few cases notified—three in January, none in February, one in March, two in April. It was not till October when the rains commenced after a long very dry season that the disease assumed active proportions. During such a dry season the level of the underground water becomes much lower, the soil dries and cracks. It is known that Enteric Fever reaches its greatest prevalence in October and November which generally coincides with the increased rainfall, and did very markedly so in the present year. SANITARY INSPECTION. This work has been kept up as in previous years, but owing to the large increase of the District and the urgency of other work, so much attention could not be devoted to these special examinations. This work of systematic inspection entails a large (35) amount of time on the part of the Assistant Inspectors, as it is not only the first visit, but the second, and in many instances a third visit must be made to the houses in order to see that the necessary work is carried out. It will, however, be seen from the Summary that 2,729 houses were inspected during the year. An additional Inspector has recently been appointed, and consequently the more frequent inspection of the tenement houses of the District can now be made. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS. Privy Council Order, 1885. The inspection of the Cowsheds, Dairies, and Milkshops in the District under the above order has been carried out as in other years. As mentioned in my last report the Cowsheds are gradually disappearing, at the present time there is only one remaining in the Kilburn District. The vendors of milk find it more profitable to receive the milk from the country than to keep their own cows, and the grazing land being utilised for building purposes likewise handicaps the keeping of cows. There are seven cowsheds in the remaining (36) portion of the District which received attention and were kept under observation. The conditions were favourable, as in no instance was there any necessity to take stringent measures to enforce compliance with any necessary requirements. The cows being out grazing the owners were called upon to cleanse and limewash the cattle lairs. DAIRIES AND MILKSHOPS. There are 70 Dairies and Milkshops registered in conformity with the Order. The greater number of the premises were found in a very clean condition, but in some instances the limewashing and cleansing of walls, &c., had not been carried on periodically as required by the Privy Council Order, and in one instance the odour emanating from the copper used for heating water for cleansing of utensils was so pungent as to lead to a further examination, when it was discovered that the encrustation of putrid fat on the sides of copper when heated diffused the objectionable odour experienced. In two instances the drains were discovered to be very defective, and in one case they were of a most primitive type, being constructed of bricks. This was in a very old house. In another instance there was found a large heap of putrid and decaying vegetable refuse which was of a most objectionable nature. (37) Notices were served on all the offenders, and others contravening the Regulations, and the conditions were amended without unnecessary delay. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. There has not been any addition made to the number of slaughter-houses, consequently there are five licensed and four registered. As I have in my former report advocated the desirability of the Council providing a Public Abattoir, I shall refrain from enumerating the advantages to be derived from such a course, but must still condemn the unsuitable situation of some of the registered houses. The premises were visited from time to time at uncertain intervals, and the limewashing and frequent removal of blood and offal ordure insisted upon as required by our slaughter-house Regulations. In one instance the receptacle for retaining the blood and preventing its escape into the drain was totally inadequate for its purpose, as on visiting while the slaughtering was in progress the blood was flowing over, and making its way down the drain inlet. The proprietor's attention was at once called to this, and a new and larger receptacle was provided. (38) FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACT, 1878-1895. Prior to the passing of the Factory Acts, 1895, Laundries were excluded from the operation of the Factory Acts. By the passing of this Act the control of Workshops are now placed under the supervision of the Sanitary Authority. The provisions of the Act are set out under three principal heads, Cleanliness, Overcrowding and Ventilation. The Factory Act of 1895 lays down specific Rules and requirements regulating Laundries. The Laundries are placed under two heads, those using team power are known as Factories and are under the supervision of the Factory Inspector. All other Laundries using only manual power come under the definition of a Workshop and are controlled by the Sanitary Authority. The number of such in district aggregate a total of 140. A very large number of these do not employ more than two outside hands and are thus exempt from the provisions of the Act, but are visited from time to time during the systematic inspection of Houses. The workrooms of the larger premises were all measured up and the necessary papers properly filled in and forwarded to the proprietors for the information of their employees. (39) The smaller laundries are usually carried on in private houses and are totally unfitted for such purposes. The stove for heating is located in the middle of the Ironing room and is surrounded by women employed. In a number of instances the temperature of the Ironing room was taken and was found to be most excessive, the heat from the stove being supplemented by the Solar heat and ranging from 90 to 118 degrees. In this latter instance the stove was red hot and the heat almost insufferable. The statute calls for a reasonable temperature to be maintained in a Laundry, but gives no definition of what might be considered reasonable, it is therefore difficult to discriminate. In premises built for the business of a laundry special provisions are made for the effectual ventilation of Workrooms, but in the private houses improvised for the purpose the means of ventilation require structural alteration in a number of instances. In taking the dimensions of workrooms four cases of overcrowding were found to exist. In one instance five women were engaged washing in a room having only sufficient air space for two. In many cases the periodical Limewashing has not been observed. (40) Notices requiring the necessary Sanitary Work and amendments were served and in all cases no difficulty was experienced in enforcing same. The workshops which include Dressmakers, Tailors, Bicycle makers, and other miscellaneous businesses aggregating a total of 56 were inspected. The Dressmakers with a few exceptions are on a very small scale and employ but two or three hands besides the proprietress. In many instances the workroom is improvised for the occasion, and often serve the purpose of living rooms. The larger establishments were also visited and the workroom measured up and the necessary papers properly filled up and forwarded to the proprietor to exhibit in a conspicuous place in the workroom. In only one instance was there any over-crowding as laid down by the Statute, which provides that every adult shall have 250 cubic feet of Air space. The premises generally were found in a cleanly condition, but the provisions for ventilation were not all that should be desired. The Tailors' workrooms were found with a few exceptions in good condition, only one case of overcrowding being discovered. (41 ) The Bicycle makers are on the increase in the District, these were kept under observation and in two instances instructions were given that special provisions should be made to carry off the fumes emanating from the process of brazing. As this business is of a very dirty nature the periodical Lime-washing of premises is essential. Notices were served on the Proprietors to carry out the necessary work as required by the statute and in all cases were observed. BAKEHOUSES. The Bakehouses in District number 51; of these 19 are underground, and in many instances are not all that could be desired, being dark, with low ceilings, and not efficiently ventilated. The Bakehouse Regulations call for the limewashing to be done twice a year, but it is found necessary to call upon the proprietors of those underground to do so at more frequent intervals. The greater number of those built above ground are kept in a most cleanly condition, and in a few instances where the walls are covered with white glazed tiles or bricks, the appearance of cleanliness and light is greatly enhanced. In no case was there any serious fault calling for special attention, but in three instances the sanitary arrangements of premises were remodelled. (42) New cards with the Bakehouse Regulations were printed and distributed to all the proprietors, calling their attention to the necessary lime washing, &c. REMOVAL OF FISH OFFAL. This, as in previous years, has caused a great number of complaints owing to the surreptitious removal of offal from the fish shops of the District. The odour from the emptying of the receptacles into the iron tank or cart is most objectionable and sickening, it impregnates the air for a considerable distance, causing a great annoyance to pedestrians. Our Bye Laws call for this offensive matter to be removed between the hours of 12 o'clock midnight and 6 o'clock a.m. The greatest difficulty is experienced by the collectors in persuading the proprietors to get up at so early an hour to give access to the tins used for storage, and they often have to go away without collecting, leaving the tradesman to dispose of it in the manner above referred to. As the nuisance is a growing one and of constant recurrence, I should like to suggest that the Council enter into an agreement with one of the fish-collecting contractors to collect at certain stated times the fish offal from all the shops in the District, the contractor to find all plant and the disposal of offal, but the Council to have a man to help in the collection, who, (43) upon finding any tradesman refusing to allow its removal, should give immediate information to the Sanitary Inspector, and he, on at once visiting and finding this objectionable matter not removed as required, would be thus enabled to report to the Council with a view to proceedings being taken against the offenders. CELLAR DWELLINGS. In the neighbourhood of South Kilburn there are a considerable number of houses of which the basement floor does not comply with the definitions of a cellar dwelling, as laid down by the statute, i.e., Unless the following requisitions are complied with; unless the ceiling of room is at least three feet above the surface of ground or street adjoining; unless there is an open area extending along the entire frontage at least 2 feet 6 inches wide. There are also several other clauses in the statute which in some instances preclude the rooms being used as a dwelling. The greater number are located under shops, and are often let separate as a living and sleeping room, and a constant watch has to be kept, as the shops are often changing hands, and the new tenant lets the basement floor, ignorant of the fact that it is illegal to so let or occupy. These rooms are totally unfit for occupation, being dark and damp, and without efficient means of ventilation, it being necessary in some instances to (44 ) provide artificial light. As it is a contravention of the Act to knowingly let or occupy as a dwelling any premises not coming within the above definition, notices are at once served on the owner and occupier to vacate. During the past year 11 such notices have been served, and the owner prohibited from re-letting same. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. In only two instances were the provisions of the above Act set in force during the year. These premises were located in the High Road, Willesden Green, being two old and dilapidated cottages. Notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1875, Sec. 91, and the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Sec. 32. Proceedings were taken, and the Justices made a closing Order. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875. The Middlesex County Council have the enforcing of the provisions of the above Act. A Report was submitted to this Council from their Inspector, shewing the number of samples taken under the Act in the Willesden District for the year ending September 30th, 1898. The following is a Summary thereof:— (45) Not Adulterated 367 Inferior Quality 12 Adulterated 9 Margarine not Labelled 2 Total 390 The number of adulterated samples appear to be few, being slightly over 2 per cent. GIPSY CARAVANS. The nuisance from the locating of Gipsies with their vans and tents on the vacant land in the neighbourhood of Harlesden has been more persistent than in former years, and consequently a greater number of complaints from the residents in the immediate vicinity have been received. The law in respect to nuisances is the same for tents or vans as for houses, but owing to their temporary location, it would be better to make Bye-laws which would aim in preventing nuisances rather than to trust to Statutes, which only enable us to demand their abatement. Section 9 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, empower a Sanitary Authority to make Bye-laws for promoting cleanliness and for the prevention of nuisances, etc., arising from vans, tents, sheds. During the year the Council instructed that proceedings should be taken against these itinerant hawkers, and Notices were served under Sec. 91 of (46) the Public Health Act, and Sec. 9 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, on the offenders, and in ten instances orders to abate were obtained. This has had a salutary effect, as but very little persuasion is now necessary to get their assent to vacate the neighbourhood. BALLAST BURNING. A great number of complaints have been received during the year from the occupiers of houses abutting on the various building estates of the district, from the offensive smell and smoke generated from the burning of clay. The nuisance is of constant recurrence from the large amount of land being developed for building, and is one which is most difficult to deal with, as there are no regulations stipulating the distance from inhabited houses that a fire may be lighted. It appears necessary that the Sanitary Authority should have the power to locate the position of the fires, as by being in close proximity to the adjoining houses they cause great annoyance and inconvenience to the occupants. By the time the matter has been reported to the Council and proceedings taken the fire has, in most instances, burnt entirely out. In one very bad instance the fire had been burning for three weeks within 40ft. of the adjoining inhabitants' bed-room windows, and after taking proceedings against the offender, the Magistrate ordered the nuisance to be abated within 14 days. (47) LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. During the year legal proceedings were taken to enforce the orders of the Council in the following cases. Houses in such a state as to be a Nuisance 6 Overflowing Cesspools 2 Overcrowding 2 Deposit of Fish Offal 1 Ballast burning 1 Gipsy Caravans 10 22 INSPECTION OF CANAL BOATS. During the year 1898, 46 visits were made to the Canal running within the area of the District Council, for the purpose of executing the provisions of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations. Inspections were made of 98 boats, principally those working short distances, trading between Paddington and West Middlesex, in the brick, sand, and gravel business. Many of these are hired by small men, who undertake the unloading and delivering of materials. These were occupied or worked by 99 men, 84 women, and 150 children. Of the latter I estimate about 1/6th to be above five years of age. No case of Infectious Disease was reported. (48 ) The Regulations were contravened in 12 instances, as follows:— 1 Boat not registered. 3 Boats without Certificates. 7 ,, required general repairs, painting, writing, and marking. 1 Boat, extra bulkhead defective. Notices were served to amend the irregularities, and vouchers have been received from Local Inspectors certifying the execution of the work. The Government Inspector inspected vouchors in connection with the previous year's work in September last, and expressed satisfaction with the result. SPECIAL COMPLAINTS, 1898.
