GEORGE BROOKS THOMAS REED W. FROLICH, Jun JOSEPH BOX Auditors. General Report Of Works EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR, 1881-82. 17 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly. June, 1882. Reverend Sir, Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen, It has been explained before, that the Parish of St. James does not admit of expansion as it is very closely built upon as it is. But upon comparing the Map of the Parish as it is now, and was originally, very considerable alterations have been made that at the time must have been considered very great advances. As there has not, however, been any actual extension for many years, although several variations are proposed, and will soon be in course of execution, they having not yet been actually commenced, the work of the Vestry has been limited to the maintenance of the Works under their control, very few positively new ones having been 18 taken, the amount of uncertainty still existing is sufficient to account for this, various proposed New Streets and projected enterprises, render it, to say the least, premature to expend money in a manner that may prove futile within a very limited time. The proceedings of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Electric Lighting, Telegraphy, and other imminent subjects, amply justifying a temporary delay. The subjoined abbreviated lists touch upon the most salient works executed by the Vestry, should the lists be published in extenso, it would involve almost the whole of the vestry proceedings books and all, so much being done for the Gas and Water Companies, Telegraph, Electric Lighting, Removal of Hoardings, that the entries would be simply tedious, without being interesting. That the gradual conversion of Road surfaces to wood will progress there will be no doubt, at the same time an increased watchfulness on the part of the Local Authorities will be involved with regard to the Foothold for Horses, in other words, an additional responsibility; the balance of good to some extent remains to be seen, especially in such situations where the kerbs or footways are not on the same level at opposite sides, and in several of the principal roadways of St. James's this is the case, from circumstances they were not carefully set out at first, if set out at all, but the levels have to be accepted as they are, and no blame can be attached, if, during the execution of the work, the best has to be made of fixed points that 19 cannot be remedied, the only course to be pursued is vigilance to guard against the consequences. Since the Vestry have undertaken their own Main Sewers Works, the numerous items that used to appear in Contractors' Accounts have ceased, and are now absorbed in the General Wages and supply of Material, the numerous apparently small things that are done would fill a volume. The Re-construction of Gullies has been the chief point considered, so as to obviate the necessity for openings, especially in all newly-laid surfaces, which are now increasing. The subject of Urinals is almost exhausted.—No new ones have been constructed, and those that exist are open to the attacks of every fool that can take liberties with them, the list of these small, but vindictive assaults are almost too numerous to mention. The various workmen in the employ of the Vestry are constantly trying to counteract the mischief done, and at present that is all that can be expected to be accomplished. As things stand there appears to be no means of prevention, especially, as wherever they are placed, they are, to say the least, unpopular. The Sewer in Broad Street is not an inviting subject, but it cannot last much longer without Re-construction, it is really dangerous, having been shored up internally, for about two years. This was originally done as a temporary measure, but cannot hold out much longer, Having 20 before referred to this special question, I would suggest that the fact be borne seriously in mind. Also that every Gulley that is built gradually involves a danger little thought of, and that is the general question of VENTILATION OF SEWERS, On this subject much has been written, more has been said, and more thought of, and is still in embryo. The Sewers of St. James's were mostly constructed to carry off Surface Water only, no House Drains being allowed under heavy penalties to be connected with them, Cesspools being the recognized order of the day. Times having changed, they are called upon to do work never contemplated at the first, so that the gradual variation has led to the public spread of "smells," so to speak, that were formerly confined to the houses. No data being known upon which to arrive at the results of either system, we now have to face the existing facts. As to any definite plan of "Ventilating" the complicated lines of Sewerage, no ingenuity has, as far as I know, accomplished it, 21 The effluvia (much exaggerated) may be checked in detail, but not in the mass. A volume might be written on the subject, and little advantage gained. Having gone over the same ground before, and given much attention to it, and calling attention to the fact that the drainage of many miles has to pass through St. James's, the solution, an admittedly unpleasant one, must remain unsolved. New roads can be dealt with, but as new roads they are wider and at higher level, St. James's is one of the districts that has to accommodate them, they cannot help St. James's. The Sewerage of St. James's is, on the whole, good in itself, but the various fluctuations of Acts of Parliament and so-called "fashion" have complicated affairs generally, that it is a wonder these matters are kept as well as they are ; and on the whole, they are in very fair condition. Perpetual watchfulness has its place in this result. The Gas and Water Companies would coincide with myself in saying that if the whole system could be started afresh at the present time, many, if not most of the existing inconveniences could be avoided, but as at the time when these works were done the exigencies of the day were never dreamt of, allowances must be made for 22 trying to alleviate the apparent oversight of a generation now passed. I have the honour to be, Reverend Sir, Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen, Your most obedient, humble Servant, A. P. HOWELL, Surveyor. 23 GENERAL.

Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James's, "Westminster, for the year 1881. According to the Census of 1881, the District of the Parish of St. James's covers an area of 162 acres, and contains a population of 29,865. The Golden Square Sub-District covers an area of 54 acres, and contains a population of 11,585, whereas at the Census of 1871 its population was 12,860—showing a diminution during the ten years 1871-80 of 1,275 in the number of its inhabitants. The Berwick Street Sub-District covers an area of 108 acres, and, whereas in 1871 it contained a population of 20,759, in 1881 it contained only 18,280, showing a diminution of 2,479. The District of the Parish of St. James's, therefore, has diminished in its population by 3,754 persons during the last decade; its population in 1881 being 29,865 against 83,619 in the year 1871. This decrease in the resident population is due, doubtless, to the growing value of business premises, and to an increasing tendency to reside in the suburbs of London. The mean density of the 30 population is now 184 per acre, and the nett mortality for the year 1881 was 545—a death-rate of 18.22 per 1000. The density of the population in the Golden Square SubDistrict is 215 persons per acre, and in the Berwick Street Sub-District 169 persons per acre. The mortality from zymotic diseases during the year has been 48, and there have been in addition 12 other deaths among zymotic cases removed from the Parish to extra-Parochial Hospitals. (At page 39, table ii.) Of Fever, Small Pox, and Diphtheria, 114 cases came under notice during the year; but many cases may not have been known, there being no law requiring that notice of such cases be given to the Sanitary authority. Of these 114 cases, 60 were of Small Pox, 48 of Fever, and 6 of Diphtheria. Sixty-one cases—19 of Fever and 42 of Small Pox—were removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals. During the year 1881, 52 bodies wero removed into the Mortuary. In one case disinfection was required, and the removal of the corpse was probably the means of preventing the spread of infectious disease. In 31 cases bodies were removed from the presence of families generally living in a single room, and where, but for the public Mortuary, the living would have lived and slept in presence of a decomposing corpse, upon which, possibly, a post mortem examination would have to be made before the interment could take place. In 20 cases the bodies have been those of casual strangers—homeless, or occurring in hotels or lodging-houses. 19 Inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 17 post mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in tho Examination Boom which adjoins the Mortuary. 31 The following number of Deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's during the year 1881:— First Quarter 148 Second Quarter 132 Third Quarter 147 Fourth Quarter 142 Gross mortality for year 1881 569 Deduct Deaths of Non-Parishioners: Dying in the Workhouse 31 Dying in the Throat Hospital 5 36 533 Add Deaths among Zymotic cases removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals 12 Net mortality for the year 1881 545 545 deaths in a population of 29,865 is a death rate of 18.22 per 1,000.

REPORT UPON ARTICLES ANALYSED DURING THE YEAR 1881, for the District of St. fames, Westminster, by JAMES EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P. Lond., F.R.M.S., F.C.S., Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for St. James's, Westminster. Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, During the year 1881 I examined seventy-one samples of food, all of which had been procured for the purpose by the Inspector of the Vestry. Of these samples one was a loaf of bread obtained in consequence of a parishioner having lodged a complaint to the effect that the bread sold by this baker was adulterated with alum. The bread was found to be free from adulteration. Ten samples were tinned and bottled articles of food. All these were found to be fair specimens of what they were described to be, and none of them were found to contain any injurious colouring matter. Sixty specimens were milk, of which three were found to be adulterated with water, and the vendors were warned by letter as to the consequences of continuing to sell milk of such character. I have the honour to remain, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 8, Grafton Street, Bond Street. 59 ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER.
