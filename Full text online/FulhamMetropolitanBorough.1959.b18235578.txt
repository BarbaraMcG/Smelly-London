Day (All part-time) 4 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF FULHAM PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, FULHAM, S.W,6. May, I960. To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham Mr. Mayor Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the annual report on the health and sanitary circumstances in the Borough for the year 1959. together with the report of your Public Analyst. T. McLachlan. Esq., A. C. G. F. C., F. R. I.C. I am pleased to report that there has been no serious outbreak of infectious disease during the year and the health of the inhabitants has remained satisfactory. In June the Council lost the services, by retirement, of Dr. Mary I. Adams, who had been Medical Officer of Health since 1949 and Deputy Medical Officer of Health from 1948 to 1949. The writer took up duty on the 21st September, 1959, and in view of the short time I have been in office during the period under review, my observations and comments are necessarily limited. It is gratifying to find the Council and the residents so enthusiastic in implementing the Clean Air Act and the progress made at the end of 1959 is two Smoke Control areas in operation, covering 9,754 properties and a third Smoke Control area awaiting formal approval, covering 2,483 properties. These are developments of which the Borough can be justifiably proud. In my opinion the ridding of the atmosphere of this country of the largely unnecessary man-made pollution is the most important public health problem to be faced in the next few years. At the end of the year attention was being given to possible ways in which the present programme which aims to make the whole Borough smoke-free by 1967 could be accelerated. Taking up duty in a new post as a stranger to the district brings many problems and it is with pleasure that I place on record my sincere appreciation of the help and encouragement I have received from the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee, Members of the Council, and my Chief Officer, colleagues and their staffs. In my own Department I am particularly indebted to my deputy. Dr. C A. Meade, the Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. G. W. Herrick, my Chief Clerk, Mr. J. Burton, and my Secretary. Miss R. P. Begg, for their patience and willing help at all times and to all members of the Public Health Department staff for their loyal assistance. 5 My thanks are also due to the local medical practitioners, hospital medical and nursing staff and to Dr. B E. A. Sharpe, the Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council, and her staff for their invaluable assistance and co-operation at all times. As in the past, I am grateful for all the willing assistance rendered to the Department by the various voluntary organisations in the Borough. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health. 6 Section A General and Vital Statistics Page Physical Features of Borough 7 Population and Area 7 Rateable Value and Product of 1d.

Its other boundaries are formed by the Boroughs of Hammersmith in the west. Chelsea in the east, and the Royal Borough of Kensington in the north. It is very flat and low lying being only 12—13 ft. above sea level. The subsoil is of flood plain gravel overlying London clay 20 to 40 ft. below. Subsoil water is rarely met within 15 ft. of the ground surface. Fulham is principally a dormitory Borough with a fringe of heavy industrial undertakings on the riverside, and is well served with open spaces and parks which have been added to by post-war development. The slum clearance and redevelopment programmes are also having the dual effect of improving the standard of housing and the appearance of the Borough. Area of Borough 1706 acres Separate Dwellings 29,604 Rateable Value £1,946,017 Rate levied - 17s. in the £ - Estimated Yield £1 611.600 A Penny Rate produces approximately £7 900 No. of assessments 33 556 No. of Marriages registered during the year 907 Population (estimated mid-1959) 113,300 The Registrar General' s estimate gives the mid-year population of the Borough as 113,300 - a decrease compared with 1959 of 1,400. Ten years ago, in 1949. the estimated population was 124,040 and, at that time, the population was increasing. The birth rate is 15.56 compared with 15.39 in 1958. Ten years ago the birth rate was 21 46. The infant mortality rate has risen to 21.46 compared with 18.13 in 1958, when the lowest figure ever recorded in the Borough, i.e. 18.13, was recorded. The figure for England and Wales in 1959 is 22.0. The death rate in 1959 shows a slight increase compared with 1958 - being 12.06 as compared with 11.16. Heart disease continues to be the main "killer", with cancer the next most important. This is dramatically shown in the diagram on page ll, where it will be seen that heart disease and cancer together account for nearly half the total number of deaths. With an ageing population, it is likely that this proportion will increase in future years. 8 Sex LIVE BIRTHS STILL BIRTHS Total Legitimate Illegitimate To tal L egitimate Illegitimate Males 908 835 73 19 16 3 Females 909 812 97 18 16 2 Totals 1,817 1,647 170 37 32 5 Birth Rate (crude) per 1,000 population 16.04 Birth Rate (adjusted) per 1,000 population 15.56 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 live and still births 19.96 Illegitimate Live Births per cent of total Live Births 9.36 DEATHS Total Males Females (All Ages) 1,384 716 668 Death Rate (crude) per 1,000 population 12.21 Death Rate (adjusted) per 1,000 population 12.09 INFANT DEATHS Total Males Females (Under 1 year) 39 26 13 Infant Mortality Rate:- All Infants per 1,000 Live Births 21.46 Legitimate Infants per 1,000 Legitimate Live Births 21.86 Illegitimate Infants per 1,000 Illegitimate Live Births 17.65 Neonatal (first 4 weeks) Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births 15.96 MATERNAL DEATHS - Total 1 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live and Still Births 0.54 9 1.384 Deaths as follows:- CLASSIFICATION OF CAUSES OF DEATH Under 1 Age Groups Over 65 Total 1-5 5-15 15-45 45-65 Tuberculosis.

There were 1,281 notifications - an increase of 251 over 1958. Measles accounted for 898 of the total. Three cases of poliomyelitis were notified. Two paralytic cases were Fulham residents one non-paralytic case was a non-resident. Dysentery has shown a dramatic fall. In 1958. 223 notifications were received in 1959 only 70 Whooping Cough continues to be a relatively unimportant disease - the nation-wide vaccination against this disease having effectively reduced the liability to this very distressing and damaging complaint of infants and young children. 15 TUBERCULOSIS Return for Year Ending 31st December, 1959 PULMONARY NON-PULMONARY Men Women Chi Idren* To tal Men 1to men Children* To tal Notified cases on Register at 1st January, 1959 663 490 35 1,188 53 58 13 124 Add:- Notifications 45 23 8 76 — 2 — 2 Transfers from other areas 40 21 — 61 2 — — 2 Children transferred to adults 2 6 — 8 — — — — Deduct:- Deaths (all causes) 20 1 — 21 — — — — Left the Borough 85 33 5 123 2 3 — 5 Recovered 5 16 4 25 — — — — Children transferred to adults — — 8 8 — — — — Other reasons 10 5 2 17 — — — — Notified cases on Register at 31st December, 1959 630 485 24 1,139 53 57 13 123 * For the purpose of this Return, children are recognised as adults upon attaining the age of 15 years T B Death Rate 12 4 per 100 000 Population compared with 14 8 in 1958. T B Notification Rate 78.5 " " " " " 90.7 " " Tuberculosis The tuberculosis death rate has again shown a fall, being 12.4 compared with 14.8 in 1958. There has been a steady decline in the incidence and mortality of this disease since the end of the war. largely due to the introduction at that time of drugs which are effective against the tubercle bacillus. The dramatic improvement is shown by the fact that, in 1949 the tuberculosis death rate per 100,000 population was 48.4 The notification rate for tuberculosis in 1959 was 78.5 compared with 90 7 in 1958. Ten years ago. in 1949, the rate was 192.7. 16 FOOD POISONING During the year fifteen single cases were notified and in eleven of these the causative agent was identified as follows:- Agent Identified No. of Cases Salmonella Typhi-murium 9 ,, Group E 2 There was one mild family outbreak notified of four cases but no causative organism was found. In April an outbreak of food poisoning involving 41 persons occurred in a canteen where the catering was carried out by contract. Specimens were obtained from four persons who had been affected, two of the canteen staff and also a sample of the suspected dish which was stewed steak. Laboratory investigation revealed that Heat Resistant Cl. Welchii (Haemolytic Serological Type 5) was present in the specimens from the persons affected and one of the canteen staff (who had tasted meat), and also in the sample of stewed steak. It was found that the meat, which was sliced frozen chuck steak, was delivered to the kitchen at 9.30 a.m. on 8th April and on receipt was washed and cooked with flour, salt, pepper, gravy powder and garlic, brought to the boil and simmered until 11.45 a.m. It was then cooled in the coolest part of the kitchen, but was not actually cool until 3.15 p.m. It was then put in the refrigerator. The meat was taken out of the refrigerator at 8 a.m. on 9th April and, after skimming, was warmed. The gravy was noticed to smell sour and accordingly it was poured away. After washing the meat, which tasted sweet, a new gravy of dripping, flour, salt, pepper and Worcester sauce was added. The stew was plated up at 11 a.m. and kept on hot plates until serving time at noon. After "between 20 and 30" portions had been served, it was noticed that they were "frothy" and the dish was withdrawn. Another item served on the same day was mince and it is reported that a few people who ate the mince had diarrhoea when gravy was added. This gravy was made separately but could have been ladled with the same spoon as the stew. The contributory factors were considered to be (a) Attempt to cool, in bulk, 30 lbs. meat, which was probably still at blood heat in the centre for some considerable time after it was put in refrigerator. (b) Failure to realise that the gravy could not have been unfit for use unless the meat itself was unfit for use. and (c) Long period of hot-plating allowing heat resistant Welchii to multiply. A meeting was held with representatives of the catering firm and these points were discussed and future procedure suggested which would obviate the danger. 17 SCABIES AND ALLIED CONDITIONS (Treatment Centre - Disinfecting Station, Tounmead Road) The Centre which commenced in January 1957, is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1.30 to 4.30 p.m. During the time of bathing the clothing is heat treated and is ready to wear afterwards. The work of bathing the men is undertaken by the existing staff under the supervision of the Superintendent, and the bathing of women and children by a part-time female bathing attendant. Medical practitioners are notified after treatment has been carried out. Number of treatments carried out during the year:- Adults 62 Children (under 5 years) 11 Children of school age are referred to local L.C.C. School Treatment Centres. AUTHENTICATION OF VACCINATION AND INOCULATION CERTIFICATES In several parts of the world certificates of vaccination and/or inoculation are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a Medical Officer in the Government or Municipal Service of the country of issue. The form of authentication which appears to be most readily accepted by Health Authorities abroad is that given by Public Health Authorities, whereby practitioners signatures are verified by the Medical Officer of Health. The Minister of Health therefore has asked Local Authorities to make arrangements under which any person who desires to have a certificate of vaccination or inoculation for the purpose of travel abroad may have it stamped accordingly at the office of the Health Department. The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those Health Authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Authenticators are not required to certify that the vaccination or inoculation has been properly carried out or, indeed, that it has been carried out at all; the responsibility for issuing the certificate remains with the doctor signing it. This does not imply any suggestion that a certificate of vaccination or inoculation issued by a registered Medical Practitioner requires any official supervision or control in order to be of adequate medical value. Authentication is not a requirement of Her Majesty's Government but the proposal is designed as a remedy for difficulties which have in practice been met by persons from this country travelling abroad. During the year a total of 534 certificates of vaccination and/or inoculation were authenticated.

REPORT FROM THE SOUTH WEST LONDON MASS X-RAY SERVICE (DETAILS SUPPLIED BY COURTESY OP DR. F. A. NASH MEDICAL DIRECTOR) The South West London Mass Radiography Service, which operates three Mobile X-Ray Units from its headquarters at the Western Hospital, Seagrave Road, Fulham. continues to hold regular weekly sessions at the Central Mass X-Ray Centre at that address. These public sessions on Wednesday afternoons and evenings are open without appointment to everyone over the age of fifteen regardless of where they work or live. People from all parts of South West London attend there, but the Centre is particularly convenient for those who live in the Borough of Fulham. and a considerable number 20 of them make use of it. In addition to members of the public, many patients are referred there by general practitioners, and local firms and organisations also make arrangements for their employees to attend. During 1959. 15,785 X-ray examinations were carried out at the Fulham Centre, of which total 6,408 were doctors patients. A Mobile Unit carried out seven visits to factory and other premises in the Borough, including one at which staff of the Fulham Town Hall were X-rayed. As a result of these visits a further 1,374 examinations were made. Five Fulham firms and organisations are co-operating in the attempt, being made by the Mass X Ray Services of South London, to afford some protection against the hazards of lung cancer, which is causing an increasing number of deaths, particularly in men in the older age groups, by making it possible for their male employees to use the special six monthly Chest X-Ray Service for men over 45. This service is also available to men of that age group who live in the Borough, and an increasing number of them receive regular six monthly appointments to attend the Mass X-Ray Centre at the Western Hospital. FULHAM CHEST CLINIC - ANNUAL REPORT, 1959 (SUPPLIED BY COURTESY OF DR. H C. PRICE - CHEST PHYSICIAN) 1959 was the first complete year of routine work carried out in the new Chest Clinic at the Western Hospital. It was hoped that the new layout would increase the efficiency and smooth running of the clinic, and this expectation has been amply justified in practice. This is particularly noticeable in regard to the flexibility of the wet film service during clinic sessions and the easy running of two clinic sessions simultaneously. A bronchography session is now held as required on a Thursday afternoon, including in-patients from the Chest Unit. The allergy clinic has been extended somewhat during the year, though this investigation is very time-consuming, particularly with the extensive range of sensitivity tests, both dermatographic and aerosol which are now available. Daily breathing exercise classes have been held almost continuously during the year, but these have had to be suspended from time to time due to the shortage of physiotherapy staff. It is hoped that this situation will be remedied in the coming year with the appointment of an additional member of the staff. Pulmonary function, chiefly ventilatory function, is playing an increasingly important role in chest clinic work. During the present year the Wright Peak Flow Expiratory Meter has been the main instrument in use but it is hoped to correlate this with other apparatus and by means of more extensive studies using the modified Bernstein light weight bell spirometer this coming year. TUBERCULOSIS The total notifications for 1959 was 76, showing a further fall from the 95 of the previous year, two of these being the non pulmonary variety, which also showed a decrease from the 9 in 1958. The number of deaths fell from 30 to 21, these were all cases of pulmonary disease. Total attendances (7 663), however, have shown a marked rise the pattern of earlier years has continued, following the fall in 1958 due to the disruption of the move. The present figure is slightly below the high figure of 7,711 in 1955. 21 Contact work is improving again, and the figure of 4,019 shows a marked improvement on the 2,842 of 1958 and 2,492 of 1957. Many more contacts and others are now receiving B C G vaccination shortly after birth. The general trend of the annual figures for 1959 is similar to those seen in clinics all over the country and reflects the effect of the still rapidly falling death rate on the total attendances and new notifications. The effects of chemotherapy in prolonging the life of patients with disease and eradicating sources of infection is only now becoming reflected in the falling notification rate. This withdrawal of infection from the population is also affecting the percentage of Mantoux positive reactors found in school-leavers which has fallen from 33% in 1948 to 10% in 1959, thus leaving a larger pre-puberty population at risk each year. Whilst full employment remains and living standards are good, this may be satisfactory, but the remaining sputum positive individuals who are still known to remain in the population present an ever present risk if these standards should fall again to those of the hungry thirties. Whilst we should all rejoice that the captain of the men of death has been laid low, no one in the epidemiological and preventive medical service can afford to become complacent. Some part of the increase in attendances is caused by the need for follow-up and after-care of patients who previously in the pre-chemotherapeutic period would have died within 5 years, but whose disease now becomes quiescent or arrested. These patients require several years of chemotherapy and, after their tuberculosis has subsided suffer considerably each winter from the resultant pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. The age distribution of pulmonary disease has not altered appreciably in Fulham. although the figures in each age group are too small to be significant - NEW NOTIFICATIONS FOR 1959 IN AGE GROUPS Years Males Females 1-5 5 1 6-15 1 1 16-25 9 6 26-35 9 6 36-45 8 4 46-55 8 1 56-65 5 4 Over 65 7 1 52 24 AFTER CARE During the year the social care work continued as usual and was concerned with both tuberculous and non-tuberculous patients, about 1,100 interviews being given. The operation of the Local Health Authority care and after-care service could be seen for example in the grant of free extra nourishment to tuberculous patients (an average of 63 at any onetime), in recuperative holidays free or at reduced charges (27), in home diversional therapy (3 sessions a week) and referrals to the home help service. Close co-operation was maintained with the National Assistance Board, especially over extra nourishment allowances for those not eligible for the Local Health Authority grants in kind and with many other statutory or voluntary social service agencies. Of the latter, the Fulham Tuberculosis Care Committee, of which the Care Organiser is secretary, helped 43 patients with fares, holidays, removal expenses, clothing etc., from its Samaritan Fund and made special gifts at Christmas time. 22 The Care Committee was also much concerned with the progress of the pottery workshop opened in 1958 to assist in the rehabilitation of the chronic chest patient. In spite of many difficulties over staffing and transport, classes continued to be held twice weekly and it is hoped that better premises on a site nearer the clinic will shortly be available. Housing problems loomed very large and their discussions were time-consuming and more often than not fruitless for both staff and patient. In particular the triennial review of the L.C.C. waiting list brought many enquiries from despondent applicants to whom the extremely restricted medical preference schemes of both county and borough authorities had to be tactfully explained. Those few cases which did qualify for medical preference and were otherwise eligible appear to have been offered accommodation comparatively quickly. The difficult problem, however, of getting for example, the chronic bronchitic, out of London has still to be tackled effectively. With regard to rehabilitation, the practice of meeting the Ministry of Labour Disablement Resettlement Officer to discuss individual problems with the Chest Physician, Care Organiser and patient at the clinic was resumed, and these regular meetings have been most valuable in ensuring a better follow-up of the patients' progress. The employment problems of thirty-one patients were reviewed, 16 of whom were at work at the end of the year. It is gratifying to note that the Ministry of Labour appreciates the scope for more intensive individual case work in this aspect of the work, and it is hoped this will be developed in the future in spite of overall staffing considerations of the Ministry. NON-TUBERCULOUS CHEST DISEASE This is demanding increasing attention because of its annual toll and its increasing severity in the polluted air of the London conurbation.

How much longer will the public conscience allow unlimited freedom for the advertisement and sale of a dangerous habit-forming drug like tobacco. 228 new non-tuberculous patients were referred to the clinic last year compared with 175 in 1958 and routine attendances rose from 1,187 to 1,558. Non-pulmonary 23 attendances now form 20.3% of the attendances against the 27.2% of notified cases attending, the balance of 52.4% being contact attendances. This figure of 20.3% for the non-pulmonary attendances will continue to rise in the next ten years. The pilot survey, the preliminary to the Nuffield population survey of respiratory symptoms was started in May, 1959. Six months were spent in studying the methodology, with particular reference to the structure of the population in this borough. The borough was divided into ten distinct ecological sub-areas, based on housing, proximity to the river, main roads, type of dwelling, etc. Invaluable assistance was given in this preliminary work by the public health department and other local authority departments. Towards the end of the year a small pilot survey was carried out in the Hammersmith area to test the questionnaire and interviewing techniques. The main Fulham survey was scheduled to start in January, 1960, and 2,500 will be completed shortly on the basis of visiting all the families in dwellings selected at random.

HOME NURSING In Fulham. Home Nursing is provided by the Fulham District Nursing Association, a voluntary body which receives the major part of its financial resources from the London County Council, the Statutory body responsible for the provision of this service under the National Health Service Act, 1946. The Department receives every co-operation from the Superintendent. Miss P. N Crook. S.R.N S. C. M. Q. N , and Mr. Vernon Phillips, Secretary/Accountant of the Association, who has kindly supplied the following details of the nurses work:- Cases nursed 2,026 Visits to patients over 65 years 41,770 Total visits to patients 54 829 New Cases Sent by Doctor 1,417 Sent by Hospital 537 Sent by T.B.

The General Nursing Care figures remain very high while those requiring injections have again shown a considerable reduction. More terminal cases are being sent from hospital and this has tended to increase the necessity for visits late at night. EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FULHAM OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE KINDLY SUPPLIED BY C. F. THATCHER, ESQ., LLB., HONORARY SECRETARY OF THE COMMITTEE Meals on Wheels and Luncheon Clubs The number of meals supplied by this service for the period January to December, 1959, was as follows:- Meals on Wheels 8,953 Luncheon Clubs "Brunswick" (Red Cross) 4,142 "Coronation" (W. V. S.) 2,706 "Shamrock" (W. V. S.) 2, 375 "Lytton" (W. V. S.) 127 (Opened November, 1959) 18,303 The delivery arrangements both to the housebound old people and luncheon clubs was undertaken by the W.V.S. Due to the shortage of helpers to carry out the delivery of meals, the W.V.S. were at times in difficulty and appeals were made for volunteers for this work. The service, however, was at no time interrupted on this account. The meals were purchased from local caterers and made available to the old people for 10d. each. The London County Council paid their usual subsidy of 11d. per meal; the Committee paid a further subsidy of 2d. per meal and met the cost of transport. Due to shortage of voluntary helpers for this service the Committee's hopes to increase the number of meals per week supplied to housebound old people has not yet been realised but efforts are continuing in this direction. 27 Invalid Meals Invalid Meals for London continue their vital service in delivering meals to invalids needing special diets. A large proportion of the recipients are those over 65 years of age and meals are delivered on five days a week. The meals are prepared at the Munster Road kitchen and are delivered only to those who qualify for them by reason of their physical condition which has to be supported by a medical certificate. The charge varies according to circumstances, the minimum being 1s. 4d. for each meal. The two vans used for delivery work to full capacity and It is planned to employ one further van shortly to meet the increased demand for the service. Social Clubs Old people's clubs in the Borough now number 13, 7 of which are run by the W.V.S., two by Bishop Creighton House and the remainder by other local voluntary organisations. Two new clubs were opened during the year. Most of the clubs receive indirectly from the Council some measure of financial assistance towards their expenses in providing recreation and all their weekly meetings are well supported. Apart from the companionship which these gatherings offer, the clubs are a useful means of disseminating information which is of particular interest to elderly people. As in previous years the Mayor and Mayoress visited the clubs from time to time and took a keen interest in their activities. Chiropody Last year the Minister of Health authorised the extension of chiropody services under Section 28(1) of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and the London County Council besides increasing the number of sessions at its own foot clinics agreed to bear the cost of chiropody services provided by voluntary agencies, Particulars of the two chiropody clinics hitherto financed by the Committee and in future to be financed by the L.C.C. are given below:- British Red Cross Society, 52 New King's Road. S.W 6. Day Time Chiropodist Tuesdays 9 a.m. - 1 p.m. Miss Hardman ,, 2 p.m. - 4 p.m. Mrs. Taylor Bishop Creighton House, 378 Lillie Road, S.W.6 Day Time Chiropodist Tuesdays 10 30 a.m. - 12. 30 p.m. Mrs. Taylor ,, 1.30 p.m - 5 30 p.m. Miss Hardman The number of treatments for the period 1st January. 1959 to 31st December, 1959. were as under:- British Red Cross Society 588 Bishop Creighton House 625 During the year the Committee also inaugurated a domiciliary chiropody service which enabled treatment to be given to old people too infirm to visit a clinic. During the period July to December. 62 treatments were administered to 27 housebound patients. The cost of this service is also being borne by the County Council. Holiday Scheme This scheme offers a seaside holiday at Broadstairs in good class boarding houses at very reasonable terras to all Fulham residents over 60 years of age. In the year under review 241 pensioners availed themselves of these facilities as compared with 193 in the previous year and the periods and charges were as follows:- 28 Charges per week for accommodation Return fare £ s. d. s. d. 12th September - 26th September, 1959 3 17 6 15 0 20th May - 3rd June. 1960 4 0 0 15 0 The parties travelled from Fulham Town Hall direct to the boarding houses by coach and escorts were provided by local voluntary organisations. The pensioners enjoyed several concessions offered by Broadstairs Urban District Council such as the free use of deck chairs, reduced rates of admission to entertainments, etc. Christmas Parcels A very generous donation by His Worship the Mayor (Councillor W. J. Bolton, J.P.) out of his Charity Fund enabled the Christmas parcels delivered this year to old people in the Borough to be increased to 300. The names were selected from those recommended by local organisations and churches and the Christmas fare was parcelled and delivered by Fulham Boy Scouts under the supervision of Mr. A. E. Corrock of the 23rd Fulham Group. Co operation between the Committee and local organisations who also distribute parcels helped to avoid duplication and consequently to extend the field of this scheme which brings so much pleasure to old people. Home Decorating Scheme The Committee accepted a kind offer by the International Voluntary Service to send a "work camp" of young people to Fulham for the weekend 12th-13th March, 1960, to decorate the rooms of about 6 old people. As was expected there were many more nominations by organisations than the 6 asked for and a careful selection had to be made. It transpired that only 5 addresses in Fulham could ultimately be dealt with but it is hoped to arrange further camps in future. Those who benefitted by the first scheme were most appreciative and included an old lady who was blind. BATHING FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY Public Baths Old people may obtain without charge, a hot bath at the Fulham Baths on Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10 a.m. and 12 noon, and 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. I am informed by the Baths' Superintendent, Mr. R. C. Gerred. M.N.A.B.S., M.I Mar.E.. that 30 40 persons a week take advantage of these facilities. Home Bathing This service was commenced in April 1954. It has proved immensely popular and not unduly costly. Number of baths given 2,154 Number of persons receiving baths at end of year 90 Number of persons on waiting list at end of year 4 At the moment there are 4 part-time female attendants engaged on this work paid on a sessional basis. It is hoped to increase the number of baths given as soon as additional suitable staff to carry out the duties can be found, and there are sufficient persons on the waiting list. 29 S. O. S. CARD SCHEME The S.O.S Card Scheme was started in August, 1953, with the object of getting help quickly to elderly people in emergency. Total cards issued since scheme started 115 Total cards issued during 1959 11 OLD PEOPLE'S LAUNDRY (Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936) Service for Incontinent Persons: A scheme under the provisions of this Section to cleanse the linen and bedding of aged, infirm and incontinent persons was commenced in March. 1952, and is proving of real benefit. The work is carried out at the Disinfecting Station where modern equipment is enabling the staff to deal quickly and efficiently with the work. By arrangement with Chelsea Borough Council the laundry of their old people is dealt with at the Station. The following 15 052 articles of Fulham residents were cleansed during the year:- Sheets 3,806 Pillow Cases 1,473 Towels 1,863 Underwear 5,269 Mattress Covers 165 "Pieces" 2,181 Blankets 295 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 19 48, SECTION 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Visiting of old people whose circumstances require assessment under the above Acts is carried out by the Public Health Department. One old person, aged 83, was removed under the Amendment Act by a Magistrate's Order to Fulham Hospital because she was living in insanitary conditions, unable to devote to herself and not receiving proper care and attention from other persons. She was admitted on 26th June 1959 and died on 24th August, 1959. Departmental Records of Old People The details of old persons as they become known are recorded in the Department and the number although fluctuating is on the increase. Number of new cases investigated in 1959 330 Number of above recorded for supervision in 1959 155 Number of deaths recorded in 1959 72 Number of old people admitted to Hospitals.

The pattern and extent of inspections made showed little change from the previous year; with the important exception that the improved staffing position enabled a substantial increase in house-to-house inspections to be undertaken.

Byelaws made by the Council to secure the cleanliness of premises, persons engaged and the instruments, towels, materials and equipment used came into force on March 1st, 1957. Contravention of the Act and Byelaws can attract substantial penalties, and the Court, in lieu of or in addition to imposing a fine, can order the suspension or the cancellation of the registration. There are 89 registered hairdressing establishments in the borough. A complete survey of these premises was made in 1959 and the majority were found to be in a satisfactory condition. In five instances informal action by the public health inspectors succeeded in bringing about necessary improvements. The legal requirement to display certificates of registration and copies of the Council's byelaws was not being followed at a number of the premises, so a general reminder was issued.

(Cumberland Crescent, Fulham) Order, 1958 This Order, involving 24 premises in Cumberland Crescent and Gorleston Street, mentioned in previous reports, was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The L.C.C. (Pearscroft Road, Fulham) Order, 1958 This Order, also confirmed by the Minister, involved 51 premises in Pearscroft Road and Sandilands Road of the clearance category and a further 46 premises in these roads and Bagley's Lane added in order that the site could be properly developed. 35 The L.C.C. (Burlington Road, Fulham) Order, 1958 This Order also confirmed by the Minister, dealt with 33 premises of clearance category in Burlington Road and Burlington Place, together with 4 premises in Rigault Road added to make possible proper site development. The L.C.C. (Lurgan Avenue, Fulham) Order, 1959 This Order comprising 60 premises in Lurgan Avenue placed in the clearance area category and 24 premises in Claybrook Road added to enable proper site development to take place, was submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government during the year, and his decision was being awaited at the end of the year. RENT ACT 1957 The administration regarding questions of certificates of disrepair under this Act continued to work smoothly. The examination of documents and giving of advice was undertaken in the Town Clerk's Department, whilst inspections, preparations of forms and correspondence made necessary were carried out by the Public Health Department staff. The number of applications received fell sharply from 224 in the previous year to 63 in the year under review. When visiting premises it was often found that nuisances under the Public Health (London) Act existed sometimes, but by no means always included in the tenant's notice (Form G). Independent statutory action was taken in these cases to secure abatement of nuisances. During the year no certificate of disrepair issued by the Council was challenged by any owner or occupier in the County Court. There are still 96 certificates issued under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954 uncancelled, seven being cancelled during 1959. Details of action taken between 1st January and 31st December. 1959. are as follows - Applications for certificates 63 Decisions not to issue certificates 6 Decisions to issue certificates 57 (a) in respect of some but not all defects 41 (b) in respect of all defects 16 Undertakings given by landlords 29 Undertakings refused by Council Nil Certificates issued 23 Applications by landlords to Council for cancellation of certificates 41 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 18 Council decisions to cancel in spite of tenants' objections 9 Certificates cancelled 32 HABITATION CERTIFICATES UNDER SECTION 95(2) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936 During the year 6 certificates were issued in respect of 93 newly erected dwellings in the Borough. REHOUSING OF FULHAM RESIDENTS The situation in relation to the rehousing of Fulham residents remains substantially the same as last year, with priority being given to families displaced from slum clearance and compulsory purchase areas.

No. of visits made by Rodent Operatives _ 6,672 651 7,323 37 The number of complaints (560) received from occupiers of dwelling houses was 55 less than last year, whereas the number of complaints received from business premises (109) increased by 21. In addition to premises dealt with following the receipt of a complaint, 188 dwelling houses and 58 business premises were inspected as parts of surveys of adjoining premises to check the full extent of the infestations being investigated. All cases of infestation were dealt with by baiting treatments and any necessary proofing carried out by the owners. Most of the dwelling house infestations were found to be directly attributable to defects in the house drainage or outlet drain between the interceptor and the sewers. Disused outlet drains which served houses demolished owing to enemy action during the last war, were in most cases sealed off at the intercepting chamber leaving a dead length of drain between it and the sewer. It was often found that rats had burrowed from these dead drains. In such cases the outlet drain was sealed off at its junction with the sewer. During the year two large scale poison treatments were carried out on the sewers. In April one treatment was carried out using zinc phosphide as the poison agent, but as the results of this treatment were very similar to those carried out in previous years, it was decided to carry out two three-monthly treatments using sodium fluoracetate as a direct poison with no pre-baiting. The first treatment of this type was carried out in September and the second will be carried out in January 1960. It is hoped that when the result of these treatments are available they will show a marked diminution in the rodent population of the sewers, and that this will be reflected in a reduction of the number of cases of rodent infestation on the surface. CLEAN AIR ACT, 19 56 Industry The improvement brought about by the lessened amount of industrial smoke emitted commented upon in last year's report has continued throughout 1959. Heavy smoke emissions have been few and sporadic and in practically every case there was a reasonable explanation as to the cause. In every case managements co-operated fully in tracing the cause and rectifying the trouble. Several new factories have been established during the year and in each case possible problems have been the subject of full discussions with a view to avoiding future trouble. It is pleasing to report that smoke nuisances due to burning rubbish etc. in the open air have been few. This shows that the public in general and shopkeepers and other small traders in particular are aware of their responsibilities. in the few cases calling for the department's attention a visit proved sufficient to bring about the abatement of the nuisance and prevention of its recurrence. One other matter is worthy of special note. Many industrialists in the borough have arranged for their boiler operatives to attend courses of training. The Council's smoke abatement officer has noticed that as a result, these men can now discuss intelligently the apparatus under their charge and the techniques for running them. Despite the generally favourable position as regards industrial smoke, regular observations continued to be made throughout the year. 38 Measurement of Air Pollution TABLE OF RESULTS OF RECORDINGS AND ANALYSES Month Site Rain falI (in inches) Insoluble Deposit Soluble Deposit Total Solids Mg. of SO3Day collected by 100 sq. cm. of Batch "A" Lead Peroxide (Tons per Sq.

Every effort was made to give all householders in the area the fullest information on the action to take to comply with the Smoke Control Order. The methods employed were as follows:- (1) All householders were sent a letter after confirmation of the Order was received from the Ministry, telling them of the action to take to obtain grant aid towards the cost of any necessary conversions or adaptations of their fireplaces. (2) Estate Agents, coal merchants, local builders, the North Thames Gas Board and the London Electricity Board, were informed at the same time and their attention drawn to particular aspects of the Order with which they were most concerned. (3) All organisations with headquarters in the area were circularised and offered a speaker to give a talk about the responsibilities of householders. (4) Local Press. In their editions of the 6th February, the three local papers ("Fulham Chronicle"; "Fulham Gazette" and "West London Observer") published a prepared press statement, linked with an official announcement of the confirmation of the Order. (5) Mobile exhibition vans were loaned by the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation the North Thames Gas Board and the London Electricity Board, and these toured the area as follows:- Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation - one week. 20th to 25th April North Thames Gas Board - one week, 11th to 16th May London Electricity Board - two weeks, llth to 23rd May. (6) Reminder Leaflets. The mobile units distributed some 3,500 reminder leaflets to householders as the rate of applications for approval to alterations of fireplaces was below expectations. (7) A loudspeaker van was hired to tour the area and publicise the visit of the mobile van. (8) Circular. On the 4th August a further circular was sent to householders telling them that it was desirable to submit applications before the 1st September to enable them to receive the Council's approval to proposed works and incur expenditure before the 1st October. (9) Window Display. This was on view by courtesy of Messrs. France & Partners in their showrooms, North End Road. The display detailed the action to take and listed all the streets affected by the Order. The display has been made so that it can be re-used in subsequent areas. (10) Friends of Fulham Hospital Carnival and Tableau - June 13th. The theme of the float entered by the Department was "CLEAN AIR IS YOUR AFFAIR" based on the caption of one of the posters of the National Society for Clean Air. A picture of this tableau is shown on page 41 Smoke Control Areas Steady progress was made during the year towards the Council's aim of making the whole of the Borough subject to Smoke Control Areas as soon as possible. Confirmation of the second Smoke Control Order was received on the 29th January and by the 1st October, the operative date of the Order, 1,110 applications for grant aid had been received. In accordance with the Council's policy notices were served on householders whose applications were received after the 1st October to enable grants to be paid and by the end of the year the total number of applications for Nos. 1 and 2 Smoke Control Areas was 2 504. It has also been decided that late applications will only be dealt with in this way until nine months after the operative dates of Orders, i.e. 30th June. As soon as the survey of one area is completed, a survey of the next area starts. Householders are warned by letter that a survey of their area is being made and their co-operation invited to allow the Council's officers to gain access and ascertain the facts regarding methods of heating and cooking employed.

This possibility has always been stressed but in order to remind householders, the following message was printed in the three local papers in March:- 42 MESSAGE TO HOUSEHOLDERS It is anticipated that all Fulham will be a smoke controlled area within the next nine years, which means that more and more people will find it necessary to use SOLID SMOKELESS FUELS. OPEN FIRE COKE is the only one of these in ample supply, and the purpose of this message is to say that if you have a suitable type fireplace and follow the simple rules for its use. OPEN FIRE GAS COKE (now being sold in this district as "GLOCO") can be recommended as an entirely satisfactory fuel, suitable in all respects for domestic fires. All new grates if installed so as to obtain Council grants towards cost of conversions will operate efficiently on OPEN FIRE GAS COKE". The Chairman of the Public Health Committee, Councillor J. W. Perotti, also repeated the message at the Council meeting on the 18th March. WEST LONDON INTER-BOROUGHS SMOKE CONTROL LIAISON COMMITTEE Six meetings of this Committee were held during the year for the purpose of exchanging views and advice on common problems arising from the creation of Smoke Control Areas. All the four Metropolitan West London Boroughs, as well as those of Acton. Barnes Chiswick and Willesden are actively engaged in this work.

GERRED, M.N.A.B.S. . M. I.Mar.E.) The Fulham Public Baths establishment comprises of 3 swimming baths, 90 personal washing baths, and 2 Public Laundries. The swimming baths are respectively 75" x 25L - 100' x 30' - 125' x 35'. They are filled from the Metropolitan Water Board mains, and from then on are purified by continuous pressure filtration, with a 4 hour turnover. Chlorine is used as a sterilising agent, and bacteriological tests are taken regularly, which show a high standard of purity commensurate with recommendations of the Ministry of Health. Once a year all baths are emptied for thorough cleaning. During the winter season, two of the swimming baths are closed and floored over, being used for badminton, indoor bowls, table-tennis, meetings, dances etc; while one swimming pool remains open all the year. The facilities in both the private warm baths, which includes showers, foam baths etc, and the Public Laundries, prove very popular and are used to capacity particularly at the weekends. 44 Section E Inspection and Supervision of Food Page Food, Examination 45 Food, Voluntary surrender 45 Milk 45 Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations 46 Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations 47 Sampling, Foods and Drugs 48 Adulterated or Irregular Samples and Food subject to Complaint 48 Bacteriological Examination of Foodstuffs 52 Basement Bakehouses Survey 52 Food Establishments, Inspection 54 Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 55 Report of the Council's Public Analyst Thomas A. McLachlan 55 45 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD There are no offensive trades, slaughterhouses or licensed slaughtermen in the Borough. EXAMINATION OF FOOD AND SEIZURE OF UNSOUND FOOD Certain articles of food which are liable to be adulterated are controlled by sampling and chemical analysis by the Public Analyst, but foods which deteriorate in quality, and become unfit for human consumption are supervised by inspection and can be seized with subsequent condemnation by a Justice of the Peace and destruction. Voluntary Surrender of Food In practice, shopkeepers make very little attempt to sell to the public any foodstuff which is unfit for human consumption and it is customary for retailers who find food they have purchased from wholesalers to be unsound at the time they receive it or to have become unfit after storage on their premises to notify the local authority, and request an inspection by the district public health inspector who, if satisfied after examination that the food is unfit, issues a certificate to that effect and arranges for its removal to, and destruction at, the Council's Refuse Destructor. During 1959, 827 Certificates of Condemnation were issued by the public health inspectors relating to the undermentioned voluntarily surrendered foods:- Tinned, Packeted and Bottled Food 8,458 items Rice 112 lbs. Milk Powder 56 lbs. Apricots 209 lbs. Coffee 6 lbs. Chicken 66 lbs. Confectionery 3 lbs. Dried Fruit 44 lbs. Fish 55 lbs. Meat 1,360 lbs. Kidneys 24 lbs. Sale of Milk Regulations, 1939 The above Regulations state that where a sample of milk contains less than 3% of milk fat and less than 8.5% of solids not fat, until the contrary is proved, the sample shall be deemed to be not genuine. The following table sets out the monthly statement of the number of samples taken, together with the percentage of fat and non-fatty solids present. These percentages follow the usual trend. Month No. of Samples Fat Average % Non-fatty solids January 17 3.73 8.70 February 10 3.57 8.60 March 9 3.33 8.68 April 8 3.51 8.68 May 11 3.48 8.72 June 14 3.40 8.64 July 8 3.55 8.55 August 2 3.55 8.60 September 10 3.68 8.59 October 7 3.93 8.68 November 11 3.80 8.65 December 10 3.66 8.69 Monthly Average 3.59 8.65 46 Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations, 1956 These Regulations prohibit the sale for human consumption of milk described as "Channel Islands", "Jersey". "Guernsey", or "South Devon" if it contains less than 4% milk fat. The following table shows the details of samples taken - No. of samples Average % Fat Non-fatty solids 28 4.36 8.92 In no case did a sample fall below the minimum of 4.0% milk fat.

Registration of Purveyors of Milk The arrangement whereby milk was sold from retail shops continued and there were on the register at the end of the year 132 number of premises so engaged. Number of Inspections of milk shops 128 Number of Inspections of Dairies 56 Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc ) Regulations 1959 These Regulations came into operation on the 27th April, 1959, and consolidated and amended the previous Regulations. 47 Ingredients used in the manufacture of ice cream are to be pasteurised or sterilised and thereafter kept at low temperature until the freezing process is begun. As before, ice cream which has been allowed to reach a temperature exceeding 28°F must be heat treated again before sale. Exempted from the heat treatment requirements are water ices and ice lollies that are mixed before freezing and have a pH value of 4.5 or less. During the year, the trend towards the exclusive sale of wrapped ices continued. Routine sampling has been carried out, and it is pleasing to report that every sample has reached the highest grade of cleanliness prescribed under the Regulations. Details of samples taken are as follows:- Wrapped "Loose" Total Ice Cream 23 7 30 Lollies 29 — 29 59 All samples reported in Grade 1. The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959 These Regulations came into operation on the 27th April, 1959, and revoked and replaced the Pood Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1953. The Regulations prescribe amended standards for ice cream and for "Parev" (kosher) ice and introduce separate standards for dairy ice cream and for milk ice. The requirement that ice cream should contain not less than 10% of sugar is replaced by a Drovision that no type of ice cream shall contain any artificial sweetener. The standard of composition briefly stated is as follows:- Ice Cream. Shall contain not less than 5% fat and 7½% milk solids other than fat. (Where ice cream contains any fruit, fruit pulp, etc. the total fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½% of the whole). Dairy Ice Cream. Shall contain not less than 5% milk fat and no other fat and not less than 7½% milk solids other than fat. (Where dairy ice cream contains any fruit, fruit pulp, etc. the total content of milk fat and milk solids other than fat, shall be not less than 12½% of the whole). to ilk Ice (or milk ice containing any fruit, fruit pulp, etc.) shall contain not less than 2½% of milk fat and no other fat and not less than 7% milk solids other than fat. "Parev" or kosher ice shall contain not less than 10% fat and no milk fat or other derivative of milk. During the year a total of 32 samples of ice cream were obtained with the following results:- Commodity Average % Fat Non-fatty solids Total solids Ice Cream 9.39 27.07 36.46 Dairy Ice Cream 11.56 28.68 40.24 In no case did a sample fall below minimum requirements. 48 Food and Drugs Sampling During the year 800 samples of food and drugs were purchased by the Sampling Officer and submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis. The Public Analyst commented adversely on 48 or 6% of the samples submitted. Of particular interest were the results of the sampling of currant and bun loaves which took place. From the first batch of samples obtained it was found that the fruit content varied between 4.5% and 16.3%. the cost per lb. of the loaf being 16.0d. in the former case and 16.9d. in the latter. The results of this first examination led to a discussion with all the bakers concerned, with a view to achieving a bun loaf which would have a minimum fruit content of 10%. It was somewhat surprising to find that many bakers had no idea of the quantity of fruit that went into their loaves others had a carefully measured quantity. The investigation and the communication of results were welcomed by almost every baker concerned and there was general agreement to reach and maintain a minimum of 10% fruit content. By the end of the year this standard was being kept - in many cases being well surpassed - by all but two or three of the producers. The following details show the improvement achieved:- Average fruit content of loaf on first sampling 8.0% " " " " " when last sampled13.83% 49 samples involving 67 loaves were submitted during the course of the investigations. By the end of the year the sale of milk from automatic vending machines on the forecourt of premises had been commenced at six sites. The extension of automatic vending to other premises and a wider range of foods will undoubtedly follow. Thirty complaints were received from members of the public regarding food which were fully investigated.

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF FOODSTUFFS (a) Cream filled confectionery is an excellent medium for the growth of bacteria and thus the transmission of illness and because of this, routine sampling takes place of the filling at the bakeries and of the completed confectionery as exposed for sale in the shops. The results obtained were highly satisfactory. The samples are examined for the presence of faecal coliform bacillus and staph aureus, and if either is found, conditions are checked at once and possible sources sought. Of 136 samples submitted, only I was found to be unsatisfactory containing both faecal coli and staph aureus. The usual enquiries took place and follow-up samples proved to be clear of either bacillus. The following table sets out the results:- B. Coli (non faecal) present 135 B. Coli (faecal) present 1 Staph. aureus positive 1 Staph. aureus negative 135 (b) Other samples submitted for examination were:- Toffee apple 1 Stringless green beans (canned) 12 The following table sets out the results:- Diph theroid bacilli and staph albus 1 (toffee apple) Sterile 12 (beans) FACTORIES ACT, 1937 Section 54-Basement Bakehouses The above Section imposes certain duties upon the Borough Council regarding the closure or certification for fitness for use of basement bakehouses. The Section defines a basement bakehouse as "a bakehouse any baking room of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room" and requires that 53 (1) No basement bakehouse shall be established anew; (2) No basement bakehouse may be used as such unless certified by the local authority under the Factories Act, 1901; (3) If the use of the basement bakehouse is discontinued for a period exceeding twelve months, it must not be used again (4) Every local authority shall examine all basement bakehouses between 1st July, 1938, and 30th June, 1939, and in every fifth succeeding year. After the first examination the local authority shall either:- (a) Certify the bakehouse as suitable for continued use without prejudice to the local authority's power to revoke the certificate as a result of further quinquennial examinations or (b) Give at least one month's notice of closure of the bakehouse. There is power of appeal to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction against the notice that the Certificate of Suitability of a basement bakehouse is to cease to have effect is given to the occupier, exercisable within twenty-one days. When the first examination under the Act was made in 1939 there were 47 such bakehouses of which 17 had fallen into disuse prior to the coming into force of the Act. Owing to the war no survey was carried out in 1944. The 1949 survey was concerned with 18 bakehouses still in use and in 1954, certificates of suitability were renewed in the case of 9 such premises. They were:- (1) 52-54, Dawes Road (2) 16-18, Greyhound Road (3) 393, North End Road (4) 78, North End Road (5) 96, New Kings Road (6) 102, North End Road (7) 26, New Kings Road (8) 63, Walham Grove (9) 169, Greyhound Road Of these, Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 have been disused for baking purposes for over one year and may not be used again, whilst in the case of No. 1, baking ceased on the 24th April, 1959, and is not likely to be resumed. Following the quinquennial review during the year Certificates of Suitability were therefore renewed in respect of two premises only - 96, New Kings Road 169, Greyhound Road Various factors have contributed to the continuing decline in the number of basement bakehouses in use. Perhaps the most important one has been the merging of businesses and the resultant concentration of baking in larger and more modern bakeries at a more economical rate of production. It is infinitely more pleasant for employees in the baking industry to work in new bright factories than to spend their working days below ground. It is not surprising therefore that the two remaining basement bakehouses are those wherein the occupiers" families play the major or sole role. 54 FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS Regular inspections were carried out during the year. In no case was it found necessary to institute legal proceedings.

The future of the cleanly handling of foodstuffs must now surely lie with the growing child. His elders - at least those employed in the food trade - have had ample scope over the past few years for putting into practice some elementary rules to safeguard the cleanliness of food whilst it is in their care. Many of them have accepted the opportunity eagerly as have many of the firms who employ them. Some have not, and "don't want to know about it", and whilst this latter group exists, there will still be room for improvement. Public health authorities always seek the willing co-operation of people affected by the laws which they are called upon to administer, thereby it is felt that the most lasting progress is made. It is not possible however, to protect the unwary from the unscrupulous all the time, hence the plea - made in this report last year - for the inclusion of instruction on clean food handling into the curriculum of scholars in their last year at school. In this way, the adolescent might become the standard-bearer for a clean food movement that would ultimately extend to every cafe, shop and home in the land. The implementation of the Regulations has gone on quietly during the year, but in two cases it was found necessary to institute legal proceedings for smoking, in one case in a bakery, and in the other behind the counter of a cafe. REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ANALYST THOMAS McLACHLAN, A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., M.I.Biol. During the year 1959, 800 samples of foods and drugs were examined. Of these 381 were taken formally and 419 informally. The number adulterated or about which some comment was made was 48. The incidence of complaint may be classified as follows:- Number of samples examined Number of samples adulterated, etc. Milk 148 1 Other foods 644 47 Drugs 8 - A sample of milk was submitted as a complaint because there were numerous dark marks on the interior bottom of the bottle. The bacteriological quality of the milk was satisfactory although the dirt consisted largely of decomposing milk solids with other dirt, thus showing that the bottle washing machines had been unable to cope with the dried decomposing mass at the bottom of the bottle. Two other samples of milk were suspected of containing arsenic but none was found. 56 One sample of butter was found to be slightly rancid, and another contained green colour suspected of being a mould growth. Examination showed that the green portion contained 69 parts per million of copper. Two samples were submitted as rolls and butter, but one was found to be spread with margarine and the other with a mixture of margarine and butter. Three loaves contained foreign material. One contained fibres resembling hemp, probably part of a strand from a mop, another a piece of material about 3" x 2", probably derived from fabric used for bags into which the formed loaves were dropped. The third loaf contained 6 poppy seeds due doubtless to their use on other loaves. 67 currant and bun loaves were examined during the year in order to determine the proportion of currants or fruit present, and whether there was any correlation between the quantity of fruit present and the prices charged for the loaf. The quantity of fruit present compared with the weight of the crumb ranged from 4.4 to 27.7 per cent, and as so frequently happens in these cases, it was found that the percentage of fruit bore no relationship to the price of the bread, either on the weight of loaf as sold or when calculated per lb. of bread. Currant and bun loaves are not bought regularly so that the purchaser has not the same information about which are the best makes as he would have with his daily white bread and it was, therefore, suggested to bakers that the quantity of swollen currants in a currant or bun loaf should be not less than 10 per cent in order to make the loaf sufficiently attractive, and to warrant the price charged, which ranges from 1s. to 2s. 6d. per lb. One sample of flour contained a maggot and a human hair and was accordingly reported as adulterated. Another contained a cluster of about 20 protozoa, but the other two portions of the sample and bags of the same flour were found to be free. The millers examined several hundred-weight of flour and their premises carefully, but were unable to offer any explanation as to why our sample alone appeared to have been contaminated. A cherry cake contained an object which resembled a metal spring, but was in fact a seed pod of a plant named Medicago which periodically contaminates vine fruits and has to be picked out by hand. A Cornish pasty was mouldy and unfit for sale and, although the mould could not be definitely identified, it probably consisted of a Fusarium species. A caramel custard submitted as a complaint contained a dead fly which had become entangled in the custard before cooking. The ingredients of a canned macaroni pudding were listed incorrectly as the label stated that macaroni was in greater amount than the milk similarly a junket powder was quite satisfactory except that the ingredients were not declared in accordance with the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order. Three ice lollies were also incorrectly labelled. Two were stated to contain a "Stabiliser", but this must be declared by name and the third gave no list of ingredients at all. The label of a tomato Juice cocktail said that it contained "condiments" but the word condiments is not an accepted term. These must be specified as spices, herbs, salt, or by other appropriate descriptions. A cream soda bottle found to contain clumps of yeast with a few mould spores was thought to have been improperly cleaned before filling with the soft drink. A blackcurrant drink contained artificial colour but, if sold as a Blackcurrant Vitamin C Drink and not as a soft drink, the constituents must be listed on the label, whereas only ascorbic acid and sulphur dioxide was declared. Some grapefruit juice contained 13.2 per cent of sugar and since the label showed that sugar and Vitamin C had been added to the product it should not have been described as grapefruit juice. A mineral water contained a felt of mould mycelium about ¾" in diameter. This was a penicillin species, and as the culture inside the bottle appeared to be a pure one the mould mycelium must have been due to a stray infection. 57 The manufacturers of a health drink, which appeared on the market with a considerable flourish of publicity, endeavoured to create the impression that it possessed medicinal properties, whilst evading the restrictions of the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. As a result of pressure from this and other local authorities they agreed to modify their label and the claims they were making. A tonic wine was satisfactory but there was a minor error in the description of active ingredients on the label. The label of a liquid cocoa preparation indicated that it was a chocolate preparation, and your analyst also questioned the use of the word "chocolate" in advertisements for this product. Some glace cherries were stated to contain "glucose", but the glucose should have been declared as liquid glucose or by some other term. Several samples of dried fruit were considered unsatisfactory. Pour samples of currants, a sample of figs, and another of sultanas contained maggots, and a further sample of currants contained an appreciable quantity of sugar crystals, with dust and loose vegetable matter. A sample of vegetable juices was stated to contain "Natural Seasonings", but in order to comply with the Labelling of Food Order these must be specified as herbs, spices and/or flavourings. Although the contents of a tin of corned beef was sterile and the meat tasted more or less satisfactory it gave the impression that the meat was stale before canning and was reported as inferior. Your analyst heard a rumour to the effect that luncheon meats from a particular country contain dried milk powder, which is not declared as an ingredient. It is not illegal to add dried milk powder to a luncheon meat, but if it is present its presence must be declared among the other ingredients. A few years ago it became common on the continent to add emulsifying salts to luncheon meats and not to declare their presence, because it was thought that British Public Analysts would be unable to detect their presence. This proved to be incorrect and the presence of emulsifying salts is now generally declared when they are used, but many manufacturers believe that they can make a better product without their use. That manufacturers, and particularly Continental manufacturers, should adopt this attitude of trying to beat official analysts is surprising, but it appears to be human nature to try to go one better than the other man. Your analyst believes that he has found out what is now being added to luncheon meats and hopes in due course to be able to stop this practice. Importers would be annoyed if they were prosecuted, but it is doubtful whether anyone outside a public analyst' s laboratory is aware of the financial cost of detecting these adulterations. A special report on these additives and another on Soup Powder Mixes were submitted to the Medical Officer of Health. A coffee spread possessed very little coffee flavour, and had a distinctly rancid taste. The fat contained 5.9 per cent of free fatty acids, showing that it was rancid. The spread contained 0.058 per cent of caffeine and the Food Standards (Liquid Coffee Essences) Order requires Liquid Coffee Essence to contain not less than 0.5 per cent of caffeine so that a product containing only one tenth of the strength of coffee essence could hardly be entitled to be given the description "Coffee Spread". A sample labelled as "100 per cent pure coffee" was in fact a dried coffee extract, and it was suggested that it should be labelled "Coffee" "100 per cent pure". A sample of "Brandy Butter" possessed an unpleasant flavour and a sickly taste and was reported as inferior. It is generally unnecessary to take action against products such as this one, as they will die a natural death. 58 New Legislation Food Standards and Reports Pour Pood Regulations, one draft Regulation and three Pood Standards Committee Reports have been issued during the year. Whilst this is no large amount of legislation or proposed legislation most of it is important and, in view of the controversial nature of the Reports it is perhaps well that the Pood Standards Committee have pondered over their appearance. Arsenic in Food The Arsenic in Pood Regulations, 1959, have now been issued. The Royal Commission on Arsenic Poisoning met 1901-1903, and issued a First Report in 1901 and a Final Report in 1903. The full reports with evidence occupied 780 foolscap pages, but as no real standards were laid down for foods generally, it was necessary to rely on recommendations, which have been amended slightly from time to time, leaving the position unsatisfactory. The present Regulations prescribe a standard maximum arsenic content, expressed as arsenic, of 1 part per million in foods generally, with modifications down to 0.1 part per million for soft drinks up to 5.0 parts per million spices, colourings and certain other substances used in small quantity. Perhaps one may be allowed to express the hope that other regulations regarding lead and similar metals will follow soon. Lead in Food During the year the Ministers responsible issued a draft for Lead in Food Regulations, which has not yet been implemented. The proposal is that approximately twice as much lead as arsenic should be permitted in foods and are, on the whole very reasonable, though your analyst cannot see why cider should be permitted to contain 1 part per million of lead, whilst perry may only contain 0.2 parts per million. Someone appears to have tripped up, but this is a point to which the perry manufacturers should attend if they wish it to be altered. Condensed MiIk The Condensed Milk Regulations, 1959, consolidate and amend the Public Health (Condensed Milk) Regulations 1923 to 1953 and now provide for the sale of half cream sweetened or unsweetened condensed milk with the proviso that it shall be labelled to the effect that it should not be used for babies except under medical advice. The regulations further lay down revised methods for the labelling of any type of condensed milk in order to make clear whether the food is prepared from full cream, half cream, or machine skimmed milk, whether it is sweetened or unsweetened, and what are the equivalent pints contained in each tin. Ice Cream Three regulations came into force during the year which affect the composition and quality of ice cream. The Pood Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1959, prohibits the use of artificial sweeteners in ice cream and, having done so, rescinds the requirement for a minimum quantity of sugar. The fat and milk solids-not-fat contents of the ice cream remain as before, though if all the fat is derived from milk, such ice cream may be described as Dairy Ice-Cream, Dairy Cream Ice, or Cream Ice. Provision is now made for Milk Ices, which contain not less than 2½ per cent of milk fat and not less than 7 per cent of milk solids other than fat. Parev (kosher) ice remains as before. Whilst this regulation makes no provision regarding the labelling of ice cream made with fat other than milk fat the Labelling of Food (Amendment) Regulations, 1959, prohibits the use of any illustration suggestive of butter, cream or milk or anything connected with the dairy unless all the fat in the ice creams derived from milk, other than that present in egg or a flavouring substance, though it is permissible to state that the ice cream contains skimmed milk solids. Any ice cream made 59 with fat other than milk fat must be labelled to the effect that it "Contains non-milk fat". Since standards are no longer made under the Emergency Regulations in order to allow for the modification in labelling of ice cream the wording of the principal Order has been changed slightly. The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations 1959, now permit a sterilisation process other than pasteurisation to be employed and, provided that the whole process is kept sterile, the conditions affecting cooling have been relaxed. The Methylene Blue Test is maintained for the bacteriological control of the quality of ice cream. Fluorine in Food The original Fluorine in Food Order, 1947, was brought into operation on account of the difficulty of obtaining suitable qualities of phosphates for baking powders. Now that conditions are normal the Minister has decided to allow a maximum quantity of 3 parts per million of fluorine in self-raising and similar flours, 15 parts per million in phosphate-containing baking powders, and 30 parts per million of the acidic phosphate content of any other food. This amendment will require more care in analytical control, but it is to be welcomed. Preservatives in Food Without doubt the most important report or statutory instrument issued by the Ministry during the year was that on Preservatives in Food. The report itself is controversial and it is better merely to summarise the conclusions. Sulphur dioxide will remain the chief preservative permitted and it is suggested that this may be used in wines, beer, cider and perry, soft drinks, fruit juices, vinegar, dried fruit, fruit and fruit pulp, crystallised, glace, candied and syruped fruit, raw peeled potatoes or dehydrated potatoes, other dehydrated vegetables, sausages and butchers minced meat, prepared starches and sugar syrups derived therefrom as well as other sugar, jams, gelatine and pectin, pickles and sauces and dry root ginger. Benzoic acid could be used as an alternative or with sulphur dioxide in soft drinks and fruit juice products. Either benzoic acid or a para-hydroxybenzoic acid ester could be used in unfermented grape juice used for sacramental purposes, liquid rennet, liquid coffee extract, flavouring syrups, and drinking chocolate concentrates. It is further suggested that propionic acid, sorbic acid, nisin, diphenyl, or ortho-phenylphenol should be used in very special circumstances. Report of Soft Drinks The Food Standards Committee issued a Report on Soft Drinks, early in the year, but it has not yet been implemented by a Regulation. The Committee recommend that soft drinks should be sweetened entirely by sugar and that artificial sweeteners, such as saccharin should be prohibited. They also recommend that manufacturers should be obliged to state the quantity of fruit juice present in drinks reputed to contain it, and finally they recommend that no soft drink contains sufficient carbohydrate to justify any claims relating to energy value. Other minor suggestions are put forward, but the three mentioned above are those which are likely to be discussed before its implementation. Milk Bread In October the Food Standards Committee issued a report on the composition of milk bread in which they stated that the Committee were divided on what should be contained in milk bread and by what description a loaf containing separated milk solids should be known. The majority view of the Committee was that bread containing not less than 4.2 per cent of milk solids not fat should be sold as milk bread. The Committee generally were of the opinion that the presence of milk fat does not greatly affect the nutritive value of bread, so that the consumer is not prejudiced by the use of separated milk powder.

Clean Air is dealt with on page 40 under Smoke Control Areas. Details of Home Safety and other activities are as follows:- Home Safety Background: Section 82 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1957, authorised Metropolitan Borough Councils to make arrangements for the dissemination within each Borough of advice for the purpose of promoting safety in the home and of encouraging the taking of proper precautions for avoiding the occurrence of accidents therein. Prior to this the Council had been limited to co-operating with the L. C. C. , particularly during their annual Home Safety Week, subscribing to the Home Safety Section of R. 0. S. P.A. and having speakers at Public Health Film shows when they were held at the Central Library. Now that the Council was empowered to take further action, it was decided that Home Safety should become part of the functions of the Accident Prevention Committee which previously had only dealt with Road Safety. The following action was taken by the Committee during the year to try and make people aware of the need to take action to make their homes, as far as possible, free from potential dangers:- Poster Campaign - "Cuts Cripple Tidy Up" 250 of these posters were displayed on Council and commercial sites the week beginning June 13th. By arrangement with Mr. Peirson, Divisional Education Officer, Fulham schools were given two copies of the poster with a covering letter giving some facts on the subject. Speakers: A panel of speakers was formed and local organisations were told in September that they were available to address them on Home Safety at their premises. Seven organisations took advantage of this offer. A "Burns and Scalds" Exhibition Stand incorporating a push-button Quiz was used at the "Friends of Fulham" Hospital Carnival and Fete on June 13th and proved extremely popular. "Check That Fall" Campaign October, 1959 to March, 1960 This campaign, in two phases, dealt with "falls of the elderly" in the first phase and in the second concentrated on making the "housewife and handyman" aware of the causes and dangers of falls. The campaign was advertised in the local press and Borough Organisations and Old People s Clubs were informed of it and invited to have a speaker to give them a talk and/or conduct a "Check That Fall" Quiz amongst their members. They were also offered the Quiz cards to conduct the Quiz themselves. As a result 152 cards were completed and returned to the Department for analysis. Of these 8 cases were referred to the North Thames Gas Board, 2 to the London Electricity Board and 2 to the L.C. C. Home Help Service for investigation. 65 Discussion Groups and Talks These were given on a variety of subjects. The talks all dealt with some particular aspect of the Department's activities. Six Discussion Groups were held to a total audience of 131 persons - average attendance 22. Seven Talks were given to a total audience of 181 persons average attendance 26. One film show was arranged for members of the Fulham Palace Road Congregational Church, which was attended by 73 persons. Posters and Leaflets Every opportunity was taken to distribute leaflets and display posters within the restrictions of limited space and finance, the Public Health Enquiry Foyer being the principal place used for this purpose. Visits by Students Apart from the regular bi-monthly visits to the Disinfecting Station of students from the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene studying for their diplomas in Public Health and Industrial Health, five students from London University taking their diploma in Health Education, also visited the Department for one day a week over a period of eight weeks. These students, who came from all over the world, were shown the work of the Department, especially in the way of Health Education. Arrangements were made, in co-operation with the Borough Architect, Mr. E. A. H. MacDonald, for a group of twelve medical practitioners studying for the Diploma in Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, to visit and inspect certain old and unfit properties in the Borough and also two modern Council Housing estates. The students also carried out an investigation into the social and health changes which could be attributed to rehousing, interviewing a large number of rehoused families in their new homes for this purpose. From the findings of the survey, it seemed that the great majority of persons rehoused on the Council's estates were happy and well adjusted in their new surroundings. FULHAM MORTUARY Following the decision of the Hammersmith Council that their Mortuary would have to be reconstructed as it was not large enough to deal with the increased use being made of it, the West London Coroner requested permission to use the Fulham Mortuary for some of his cases. This was agreed to and this arrangement was operative from the 4th February to the 9th October. The post mortem work was carried out by the Hammersmith Borough Council staff. Hammersmith paid a fee for the facilities provided and the hours worked by our Mortuary Keeper when acting as a holiday relief for the Hammersmith staff. The work carried out during the above period was as follows - 716 bodies were dealt with from Chelsea, Fulham, Hammersmith and Kensington, 5 of these bodies being admitted at the request of undertakers, i.e. convenience cases, the remaining 711 all being post mortems. In addition there were 47 Fulham convenience cases accommodated - 29 from 1st January to 4th February, 18 from 9th October, to 31st December, 1959. 66 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Section 50 - burial or cremation of the dead 11 Funerals (10 adults and 1 child) were arranged under the provisions of this section of the Act. Details of the cost of the burials are as follows:- £ s. d. 11 funerals as per contract 168 19 6 Less amount recovered from estates of deceased, or by gifts, or responsible relatives traced 115 0 1 Balance being cost to Council £53 19 5 PUBLIC CONVENIENCES There are seven Public Conveniences, each with a Mens and Womens Section, under the control of the Public Health Department, which have been constructed at various times between 1900 and 1939. All the conveniences have both a free and paid wash for the convenience of the public, the only exception being at Wyfold Road, where there is a free wash only. These facilities are well used and appreciated. New Convenience - Corner of Ismailia and Townmead Roads Wandsworth Bridge Although the work of building this convenience was due to commence in July, it was not started until September owing to the delay in deliveries of foundation bricks. Further delays were caused through difficulties in obtaining suitable coloured tiles and it is anticipated the convenience will be ready for use in May, 1960. Replacement of Gibb's Green Convenience A suitable site near the existing convenience having been found and approval to rebuild having been obtained from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, it is anticipated that the new convenience will be ready for use in 1960. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year 100 medical examinations were carried out. These included the examination of new entrants to the Council1 s service, to determine their suitability for acceptance under the Superannuation Scheme, and of others referred because of sick leave or accident. The latter usually required specialist investigation and resulted in quite a considerable amount of correspondence with private doctors and hospitals. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 - THE POISON RULES PHARMACY AND MEDICINES ACT, 1941 The retail sale of poisonous substances by shopkeepers who are not registered pharmacists is controlled by the Acts and rules made thereunder. The poisons List, which has been prepared by the Poisons Board and confirmed by the Home Secretary, prescribes two Lists of Poisons - Part I and Part II. The sale 67 of poisons included in Part I is restricted to registered pharmacists whilst those included in Part II may be sold to the general public not only by registered pharmacists, but also (subject to certain conditions) by ordinary traders whose names are entered on a List of Persons entitled to sell such poisons, kept by the Local Authority. The Acts and Rules lay down certain requirements regarding type of container, labelling, storage, transport and sale of poisons, penalties being prescribed for non-compliance. Fees are payable to the local authority by persons whose names are entered on the List. At the end of 1959 there were 153 names on the Council's List and the following changes took place in the Register during the year:- Number of listed sellers on Council's register at 1.1.59 156 Number added during the year 11 167 Number who transferred their business or discontinued the sale of poisons 14 Number on register at 31.12. 59 153 25 Visits were made during the year under review. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act regulates the sale of pet animals and empowers a local authority (in London a Metropolitan Borough) to grant licences to keep a pet shop on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings. During 1959, ten licences were renewed. No contraventions of the Act were found during 37 routine inspections. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Under this Act it is unlawful in the course of business to use filling materials to which the Act applies in any form of upholstery, the stuffing or lining of toys, baby carriages etc., except on premises registered by a local authority (in London, a Metropolitan Borough). It is also an offence to sell or expose for sale on any premises, any article containing filling material to which the Act applies, which is unclean. The standards of cleanliness for the various types of filling material are laid down in the Rag Flock and Other Pilling Materials Regulations, 1951-1954. In Fulham there are six premises registered for the use of filling materials, but the appropriate type of goods on sale in all furnishers shops are covered by the Act. During the year samples were taken as follows:- Type of filling No. of samples Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Feathers 3 3 – Hair 1 1 – Hair and Fibre Mixture 1 1 – Rag Flock 2 1 1 Kapok 2 2 – Cotton Millpuff 4 3 1 Down and Feather Mixture 2 – 2 Wadding 3 3 – Wood Wool 2 1 1 20 15 5 68 The samplesb comprised 10 of filling material taken at registered premises, and 10 of articles exposed for sale in shops. A sample of Rag Flock (No.2/59) was found to contain 32 parts per 100,000 chlorine, against a permitted maximum of 30 parts per 100,000. A letter was sent to the supplier and the wholesaler. A sample of feather and down mixture (No.9/59) was found to contain total average impurities of 3.4% against a permitted maximum of 2.0%. Legal proceedings were instituted against the supplier and the case was heard on the 18th March 1960. The magistrates found there was no case to answer and dismissed the defendants, awarding 20 guineas costs against the Council. A further sample of feather and down mixture (No.16/59) contained in cushions on sale by a kerbside trader was found to be composed of cut-up pieces of eiderdown, with very little feather and down present. The Analyst reported contraventions in respect of the chlorine content 82 parts per 100,000 (permitted maximum 30 parts per 100,000) and soluble impurities 2.3% (permitted maximum 1.8%). It was found, on enquiry, that this trader had given a wrong address and all efforts to trace his correct address had not succeeded by the end of the year. There was growing reason to believe that he had also supplied a fictitious name. Although he did not return to trade from the same place again, the Council were unable to take further action against him. A sample of millpuff found in a pillow (No.18/59) was found to be rag flock. The retailer and wholesaler were notified and the pillows ceased to be so described. A sample of wood wool contained in a pouffe (No.19/59) was examined by the Analyst as an "other filling material" and contravened the standard in respect of the average soluble impurities, the figure being 5.8% (permitted maximum 1.8%). Although the label attached to the article stated that it was "guaranteed to conform with the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act", the Ministry subsequently informed that the filling was not one covered by the Act. It was found that proposals were in hand for including this type of filling in new legislation, no further action was taken. 4
