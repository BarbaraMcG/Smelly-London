NEW 5 1899. Annual Report OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE PARISH OF ST. MARY, NEWINGTON, LONDON. LONDON: Printed by order of the Vestry, by R. Tilling, 106, Great Dover Street, S.E. 1900. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, NEWINGTON. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Annual Report for the year 1899. The various tables to be found in the report are, I believe, sufficiently clear to enable a comparison being readily made between London as a whole and Newington, and between the various parts of the parish on all important health matters. As year by year more improved methods of sanitation are adopted, and the organization of the department becomes more determined, so is it more difficult for me to refer in the report to anything fresh or novel. The work of the year compares favourably with what has been done in the past. The health of the parish, apart from an increased incidence of Diphtheria in children, and of Enteric Fever among adults in the Autumn, has been as good as usual. The year's history, although so often told, can never be uninteresting with such a parish as ours where the wear and tear of life is immense. It is amusing to hear celebrated Divines and other important personages unburden themselves on the apathy and dullness of the good people of Walworth. We may not be a fashionable folk, if that is what is meant, but that the people lack freshness and vigour, in a word, vitality, is distinctly untrue. Life is not dull in Newington, nor is the parish, as described, one monotonous area of squalid houses. It is a pity such remarks are made amongst strangers, who believe them, because no one with a knowledge of the district is there to refute them. I have to thank the Vestry for their courtesy and support, and the various members of the staff for the work that has been done.

The Health Statistics of the Parish of St. Mary, Newington, for the year 1899. I have to record a year of very active work in all sanitary matters. The death-rate for 1899 will be seen to be not quite so favourable as that for the last few years. Many causes have contributed to this increase. Whooping Cough and Measles were more than usually prevalent. The hot summer was accompanied by a heavy mortality from Diarrhoea in Infants. Throughout, I may say, the whole of the year Diphtheria was present amongst us in an excessive quantity, whilst in the autumn months Enteric Fever was both very prevalent for our parish and very fatal. The sanitary condition of the parish generally must be admitted by those acquainted with this subject, to be steadily improving year by year. There are certain parts of the parish in which the interior of the houses is not quite so clean as could be wished, yet by a little more energy we hope the homes of even the very dirty of our people may be made sweeter and less depressing. 6 A reference to the table of works carried out during the year will show that a large number of houses have had the rooms cleansed and the yards and forecourts paved. Floor ventilation and permanent ventilation to the staircases have been provided to an increasing number of houses. House drains have been reconstructed in about a thousand cases. In a large and densely populated parish such as Newington is, although much good and useful work is done in the year, the necessity for better supervision on the part of the sanitary staff becomes more pressing as time goes on. The subject of overcrowding alone, if properly attended to, would pretty well occupy the whole of the time of the present staff. Still it is pleasant to be able to report that during the last few years a large proportion of the houses in the district have passed through a very radical course of repair. The Vestry have also at considerable expense reconstructed many old and defective sewers. The reconstruction too of combined drains and sewers has entailed a good deal of expense to the parish. POPULATION. The number of the population at each Census since 1841 was— Population.

No case of this disease has been notified during the year. A few cases of Chicken Pox were notified to me as Small Pox, but the error in the diagnosis was recognised and the friends reassured as to the milder character of the complaint. Deaths from Small Pox during: the last ten years— 1890 — 1891 — 1892 — 1893 6 1894 2 1895 4 1896 1 1897 — 1898 — 1899 — SCARLET FEVER. The deaths from Scarlet Fever were 13, as against 24 in the year 1898. This is a remarkably low mortality, and it is the smallest number of deaths on record for one year. The total number of cases notified was 509 this year, against 617 for last year. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.10. Deaths from Scarlet Fever during the last, ten years— 1890 37 1891 17 1892 45 1893 51 1894 19 1895 16 1896 29 1897 33 1898 24 1899 13 Of the 509 cases notified, as many as 448 were removed to hospital. The deaths in the hospital were 11 a mortality of 2.4 per cent. 61 cases were treated at home, of which 2 died, a mortality of 3.2 per. cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital was 88.0. The disease continues to be of a mild type. From time to time cases which have been returned home as "cured" have, undoubtedly, communicated the disease to other members of the 25 family. This difficulty in the hospital cases, and especially in those that have been in the hospital beyond the usual period, is a serious one. Most of these cases that are infectious, when returned home, have a discharge either from the nose or ears, and in some cases from both organs. This discharge, although highly infectious at the moment of return from hospital, seems to lose its infective power when the child has been at home for a week or ten days. I believe that many of these cases are kept in hospital far beyond the period at which any good can accrue from such residence, indeed, I am disposed to think that this prolonged stay in hospital is harmful to the patient, and certainly renders it more capable of infecting others when it is discharged. I think that more care should betaken at the hospital to the regular disinfection of these nose and ear cases, and also that when such cases are returned home notice should be sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the district, so that they can be watched. I cannot understand why the Asylums Board will not give notice to the Medical Officer of Health when any of the patients of his district are discharged from hospital. Such information would assist Medical Officers enormously. The discharge of a patient from a crowded hospital, where the infectious disease has become, so to say, "grafted" on to the individual, must be the means of propagating the disease in many cases. The only way, as it appears to me, is to place these cases, known to be infectious in a more or less degree, in small detached houses, where each is isolated for a week or ten days before it is returned home. This would be an additional expense to the Board, but it would be compensated for by many of the cases being discharged home earlier than is now the case. DIPHTHERIA. The deaths from this disease have much increased in the year. The number being 104 this year, against 72 in 1898. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 728. The notified cases in 1898 were 459. 26 The annual mortality was 0.84 per 1,000 living. Deaths from Diphtheria during the last ten years — 1890 32 1801 44 1892 38 1893 93 1894 61 1895 52 1896 71 1897 65 1898 72 1899 104 Of the 728 cases, 633 were removed to hospital, with 78 deaths: a mortality of 12.3 per cent. 95 cases were treated at home, with 26 deaths: a mortality of 27.3 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital was 87.9. WHOOPING COUGH, The deaths from this disease during the year were 104 as against 45 for 1898. The annual rate per 1000 living was 0.84. Deaths from Whooping Cough during the last ten years— 1890 .. 87 1891 .. 115 1892 .. 93 1893 .. 109 1894 .. 75 1895 .. 72 1896 .. 66 1897 .. 82 1898 .. 45 1899 .. 104 TYPHUS FEVER. No death occurred from this disease during the year and no case was notified. MEASLES. The deaths from Measles numbered 87 against 55 for last year. The annual mortality rate per 1,000 living was 0.70. 1890 103 1891 31 1892 182 1893 34 1894 103 1895 132 1896 98 1897 85 1898 55 1899 87 27 ENTERIC OR TYPHOID FEVER. The increase in the cases of Enteric Fever began about the second week in September, and reached the highest point by the fourth week in October. The cases notified week by week up to the end of the year, were far in excess of what we are accustomed to have in this Parish. All the cases from the middle of September to the middle of November I carefully investigated. In quite one half of the cases notified within those two periods, the friends of the patients attributed the disease to the eating of Shell-fish—principally Mussels. Certainly, the eating of the Mussels had taken place about eight or ten days before the illness commenced, or within the usual incubation period. The Mussels were the Dutch variety. In one of my reports I mentioned "that Newington is not a Parish particularly affected with Enteric Fever, as anyone can see by looking at the annual reports. The Parish is generally in its Enteric rate a little below that of London as a whole. The outbreak of Enteric Fever in London commencing in the second week of September has appeared in nearly all the London parishes, but has reached its highest prevalence in the eastern and southern parishes. Enteric Fever is usually a water borne disease, and generally is introduced into the body either in drinking water, or in milk with which contaminated water had been mixed. There is another way in which the disease may be propagated by the emanations arising from a water-logged subsoil contaminated with sewage. Shell-fish living at the mouth of a river polluted with sewage may also spread the disease. Milk, as a cause in the cases reported, may, I think, be excluded, especially as no two persons affected appear to have taken their supply from the same source. It has been considered that a polluted subsoil to cause Enteric Fever must be more than polluted by the occasional storms which we complain of as flooding the basements. It must be a condition similar to what exists in parts of Dublin where the sewage polluted subsoil water is constantly on the ebb and flow. The disease, as the cases shew, has not been introduced into this 28 parish by persons returning from the country. Its widespread prevalence would point rather to the water supply, or to some article of food almost universally eaten. Before we could attack the water supply we should have to enquire whether, during the second week of September, flood water had been discharged into the mains without having passed properly through the filter beds. Again, I think, if the water supply had been affected, the disease would not have been kept within the present bounds. Shell-fish has been proved over and over again to be the cause of Enteric Fever." We know that grave pollution of the subsoil of our parish does take place during storms, by the number of houses more or less flooded with sewage. This state of things occurs in all the riverside parishes, especially the southern ones, and it is in those districts that Diphtheria is most prevalent. It was also in those districts that this excess in Enteric Fever was most noticeable. This subsoil pollution may have simply prepared the ground by lowering the general health of those inhabiting the houses in which this pollution occurs. TYPHOID FEVER. The number of cases notified during 1899 was 111, as against 90 last year. The deaths from the complaint were 23 this year, and 10 last year. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.19. Deaths from Typhoid Fever during the last 10 years— 1890 18 1891 12 1892 10 1893 13 1894 14 1895 15 1896 18 1897 9 1898 10 1899 23 DIARRHŒA. The deaths from this disease were 124 in the year. The annual rate per 1000 living was 1.00 Deaths from Diarrhœa during the last ten years— 1890 84 1891 77 1892 83 1893 126 1894 53 1895 110 1896 127 1897 165 1898 182 1899 124 29 PHTHISIS. The deaths from this disease were 325 during the year. The annual rate per 1000 living was 2.62. Deaths from Phthisis during the last ten years— 1890 285 1891 314 1892 260 1893 283 1894 231 1895 304 1896 304 1897 285 1898 298 1899 325 During the last four years it has been our practice to visit and examine every house in which a person has died from Phthisis. Disinfection of rooms after Phthisis takes place in about two-thirds of the total deaths from that complaint, viz., in more than 200 cases in the year. TABLE 10.

The various processes of disinfection, of which a full description was given in my report for 1898, have been carried out in a satisfactory manner during the year under consideration. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The number of houses on the register at the end of 1899 was two. At the time of writing this report an additional twenty.five houses have been added to the list. The work of inspecting the houses has been placed upon the shoulders of Mr. Long, Chief Sanitary Inspector. BAKEHOUSES. The total number of existing Bakehouses is 70. Inspections have been made during the year. They were all found in a clean and satisfactory state. It has not been necessary during the year to serve any notice as no defect has been complained of. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES AND COWHOUSES. Four Cowhouses and seven Slaughter-houses were inspected, and found to be in a clean and good sanitary state. Slaughter-houses. Name. Address.

In order to protect the public from the purchasing of food unfit for consumption, the following circular giving advice on the subject, was posted up in the various market places and business thoroughfares in the parish. Mestry, St. Mary. Newington. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. UNSOUND FOOD. It is very important that persons purchasing food, especially during the summer months, should carefully inspect the article so as to see that it is not in any way tainted or unsound. Food when in a state, more or less, of putrefaction or rottenness, is highly dangerous to health, and very often is distinctly poisonous. Diarrhoea and severe prostration usually follow the eating of decomposed meat or fruit. Cheap food is at times excellent in quality, but again it is often inferior and even bad. Purchasers therefore of cheap food must either exercise great care, or be well acquainted with marketing, otherwise they cannot escape being frequently imposed upon. Marketing should be done as far as possible during daylight, so that a fair examination of what is purchased can be made. Rotten food is nearly always sold either late at night, or amidst a bustling crowd of people when the purchaser has no means of forming an opinion of the actual quality of the article. If unsound food is purchased towards midnight and only 38 detected next morning it is then too late to submit it to the Sanitary Officers. In order to get any redress, food, found to be unsound after purchase, must be brought at once to the Vestry Hall, Walworth Road, for examination. It obviously would not be fair to a salesman for a purchaser to keep meat several hours before submitting it for examination, as during hot weather freshly killed meat will often in a few hours change and become unfit for food. CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD AND BAD MEAT. Good meat has a pleasant, sweet flavour in its raw state, and gives off while being cooked a savoury odour. It is bright in colour, juicy, and firm and elastic to the touch. The meat should have plenty of fat upon it. Bad or unsound meat pits or crackles on pressure. If a skewer is plunged into the middle of the flesh and then withdrawn it will be found to have an unpleasant and offensive odour. The flesh of bad meat is wet and not firm ; thin and without fat. FISH. Good fish should be firm and glistening, and the gills bright in colour. The white portion should not be discoloured. Unsound fish is soft and the skin wrinkled. The flesh pits on pressure. The gills have an offensive odour. FRUIT. Fruit in an advanced state of decomposition is injurious to health. Unripe fruit should not be eaten in the raw state, but if cooked it loses its bad qualities and becomes a useful article of food. GEORGE MILLSON, July, 1899, Medical Officer of Health. 39 ST.
