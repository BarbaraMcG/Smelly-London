To the Chairman and Members of the Willesden District Council. Genilemen, I beg leave to submit the thirty-fifth Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of Willesden. While preserving the continuity of the statistical data, I purpose limiting, as far as possible, the dimensions of the Report, which, owing to the increasing volume and variety of work thrown upon the Public Health Department, has in recent years attained what must be the limit of its practical utility viewed as a summary in compact form of the work and concerns of the department. 11 A.—VITAL STATISTICS. 12 POPULATION. The population of Willesden, estimated to Midsummer 1910, is 153,253. Since 1901, the year of the census, the population, estimated to Midsummer each year, has been as follows:— Year. Estim. Pop. Estimated annual increment of Population. Excess of Births over Deaths. 1901 116,089 — 2,141 1902 122,211 6,122 2,120 1903 129,315 7,104 2,477 1904 131,539 5,224 2,776 1905 140,758 6,219 2,457 1906 142,871 2,113 2,600 1907 146,107 3,236 2,543 1908 149,035 2,928 2,472 1909 150,145 1,110 2,494 1910 153,253 3,108 2,417 The population of Willesden from 1851, according to the Census returns, has been as follows:— 1851 2,900 1861 3,879 1871 15,869 1881 27,453 1891 61,265 1901 114,811 It will be seen from the table above that the increase in population is the greatest since 1907, while the excess of births over deaths is the least since 1902. These facts arc the more remarkable in that the nett number of deaths for the year is the lowest since 1898. 13 The Registrar-General's estimate of the population to Midsummer, 1910, exceeds my own by nearly 13,000. It is not improbable that in the trite phrase truth lies between the two estimates which, by different methods, are based upon data which perforce are assumed to remain constant, though known to fluctuate. So great an error in a datum of such primal statistical importance as the estimated population is a reproach, not to the methods employed, but to the prolonged period during which it is nccessary to assume constants as a substitute for facts more frequently verified. That a census of the population should be taken only decennially at a time when the most active changes in the distribution of population are features of a great social transformation shows the national indifference to accurate and scientific methods in investigating the problems of highest importance to the public welfare. It is highly probable that the census of 1911 will reveal wide discrepancies between the estimated and the ascertained data which form the basis of hygienic and social science, and it is to be hoped that the recognition of this fact will lead to the adoption of a quinquennial census. 14 Table No. 1.

It will be seen from the Tables that there is a fall in the marriage rate as compared with the rate of 1909, though the rate, 13 0 per 1,000, is slightly above the average of the last 10 years, 12 7 per 1,000. A notable feature of the marriage rate is the decline in the proportion performed otherwise than in the Church of England. Since 1903 this proportion has been steadily and lapidly increasing. The increase in 1910 in the proportion of marriages performed in the Church of England has been chiefly at the expense of those performed in Non-conformist Churches, civil marriages being nearly in the same proportion to the total as those of last year.

It is so low that notwithstanding a material increase in the estimated population, and a decline in the nett number of deaths for the year (which not only yields the lowest death rate, but also the smallest number of actual deaths recorded since the period when the population was estimated at under 100,000) it reduces the natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths to a level below that at which it stood when the population was less by more than twenty thousand. Be it for good or ill this decline in fertility is the most tremendous fact I have to record in connection with the vital statistics of Willesden. The conservation of life reflected in the low and declining death rates is more than compensated in its effect on the rate of natural increase of population by the rapid fall in the birth rate. I have, in previous reports, shown how birth rates in Willesden bear roughly an inverse ratio to class rentals, that is to say, that the highest birth rates are found in the class of persons paying the smallest rents, and fall to a minimum in the class paying the highest rents. 20 It is difficult to see how, under any conceivable view of these facts, they may be regarded as satisfactory. They raise an intricate series of problems which are of the most vital interest to the well-being of the State. They are so important that their full investigation is imperatively called for, and they demand an enquiry which would probably best be conducted in the form of a Royal Commission. Having regard to the fact that a census will be taken during 1911, and that the data at a period so remote from the last census are in a District such as Willesden quite untrustworthy, I have deferred giving the Birth rate this year on the estimated number of women at the procreative age period.

For 1896 and all subsequent years the death rate is nett, i.e., is corrected for deaths of residents occurring the district and nonresidents dying within. 23 DEATHS. The deaths registered in the District were 1,313 : males, 630; females, 683. Those registered outside the District of persons belonging to it were 206, giving a total of 1,519. There were 13 deaths registered in the District of persons not belonging to it, making 1,506 deaths properly accredited to the District. The crude death-rate for the year is 8.6 per 1,000. Corrected for deaths of residents dying outside the District and of non-residents dying within, it is 9 8 per 1,000. Corrected for the age and sex distribution of Willesden's population it is 10.5. The death-rate, it will be observed, is the lowest recorded. This highly satisfactory result must in part be ascribed to favourable meteorological conditions, which it is scarcely to be expected will continue to operate in future years. The death-rates for the last eight years, corrected for residents dying outside the district, and for non-residents dying within, are as follows:— 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 12.8 12.2 12.4 11.8 11.8 10.9 11.29.8 INQUESTS.

C 26 DEATHS FROM PHTHISIS AND OTHER TUBERCULAR DISEASES. The deaths from Phthisis number 116, and from other Tubercular diseases 58. The phthisical deatH rate (757 per million) is the lowest recorded. During the year cases have been notified by the officers of the Poor Law authority. Such cases as are not receiving institutional indoor treatment, are kept under observation, being systematically visited by the Lady Health Visitors. Sputum bottles are supplied to suitable cases, disinfection is carried out where indicated, and appropriate instructions are issued as occasion suggests. Institutional treatment has so far found no place among the measures adopted by the Council for the prevention of Tubercular Phthisis. The tuberculosis dispensary, the open-air sanatorium, and the hospital for advanced and hopeless cases have each a place increasingly recognised as of importance in the comliat with this disease The dispensary aims, first at the early recognition of cases at a time when the brightest prospects of permanently arresting the disease are offered by the adoption of a suitable regime in the life and habits of the patient. The open-air sanatorium is not merely, nor even chiefly, a method of treatment; it is a school where persons suffering from tuberculosis are trained in those habits which it is essential should be adopted and practised through life in the interests alike of the sufferer and of the people with whom he lives or works in intimate association. 27 Linked with the dispensary it is valuable chiefly in the early stages of the disease, and together they correlate some of the most useful efforts in the limitation of tuberculosis which most suitably may be undertaken by Local Health Authorities. In the later stages of consumption, when the chances of recovery are past, institutional treatment for a considerable proportion of the sufferers is again indicated. For the most part this is met by the Poor Law Infirmary. I am indebted to Dr. Turner, the Medical Superintendent of the Infirmary in Acton Lane, for showing me the excellent arrangements which the Guardians have enabled him to make for the institutional treatment of tuberculosis. Two large and four small wards, witli an aggregate of 30,000 cubic feet are set aside for the exclusive treatment of tubercular patients. They are admitted at all stages of the disease, though the greater number are in the advanced stages, as shown by the following return : 1910 Number of admissions ... 66 Number of deaths ... ... 25 Average stay of patients ... 93 days. The wards are excellent, but more suitable for advanced than for early cases. The early cases should, I think, be sent to an open-air sanatorium, and the need for some provision of this kind is becoming increasingly appreciated in Willesden. CANCER. The death-rate from Cancer (1005 per million) is the highest hitherto experienced. Until the changes in the age and sex distribution of the population are known it would be unwise to draw conclusions as to the significance of this disturbing increase. C 2 28 Table 13.

It is satisfactory to record a still further decline in the rate of Infantile Mortality. The rate (80 per 1,000 births) is not only the lowest experienced, but is a very material reduction on the highly satisfactory rates of recent years. I have, on other occasions, pointed out that the type of weather experienced during recent summers has been highly favourable to infant survival. Until we have again been subject to a hot, dry summer it is difficult to say to what extent the low infantile mortality is due to increased care and more intelligent fostering of infants. Miss Gaul's report upon this province of her work I reproduce as heretofore. BIRTH ENQUIRIES, 1910. " The results of some 1,200 visits made to houses from which births have been notified under the Notification of Births Act, 1907, during the year 1910, still show much that needs to be remedied in the methods of rearing infants, as carried out by the mothers of the working classes, especially in the poorest districts. There is certainly room, and indeed great need in each part of the district, for some centre in which mothers could receive advice and instruction in addition to that which is given by the Health Visitor when the birth enquiry is made. It must not be thought that the mothers do not wish to do their best for their offspring, but their ideas are so crude that the results cannot fail to be unsatisfactory. Indeed, nothing will hurt the mother's feelings moro than to suggest that she is not doing her best for the baby. The trouble is that, so often she is content to continue the methods she has become used to seeing carried out, regardless of the fact that these are altogether unsuitable to the infant. That "mother fed 13 on boiled bread" is sufficient reason for giving it to baby, although 7 of the 13 may have died in infancy. 32 Feeding is undoubtedly the most important item in the life of the infant, while it is certainly the most difficult to deal with from the Health Visitor's point of view. It has been said that "a baby well fed will grow up healthy in mind and body." It certainly will have a better chance of battling against the ills of life than the puny, ricketty child which must necessarily be the result of improper feeding. But how to make the mother realize that to feed baby "whenever he cries" is to kill him with kindness, and that to give a child of a few months of age a little of everything from the general table is extremely undesirable, is the problem with which the Health Visitor is faced, and a very discouraging task it proves in many cases. This is particularly hard to deal with where poverty makes milk unattainable, as is frequently the case. Bread and butter with a little tea, or gruel made with water, are poor substitutes for milk. An attempt has been made in the Lower Place area, where the death-rate amongst infants is particularly high, to interest and help the mothers by simple talks and demonstrations in the best methods of infant rearing. This has been attempted under peculiarly difficult circumstances. So many of the mothers are out at work during the greater part of the week, that Monday is the most suitable day for any meeting. The mothers' meetings at the Mission Churches are held on Monday afternoons, so it was considered desirable to hold the fortnightly meetings of the "Mothers' Welcome"—as the meeting has been termed—immediately following the Mothers' Meeting at the Steele Road Mission, and arrangements were made for the Health Visitors to have the use of the rooms at that time. Dr. H. J. Campbell, of Hampstead, has been in attendance at the meetings, and has provided an admirable pair of scales for weighing the babies. After superintending the weighing of the babies, Dr. Campbell has advised the mothers as to the best food to give those children who are hand-fed, and as to the best diet for the mother 33 self, to enable her to continue nursing where the baby is being breastfed. Many of the babies were wasting and insufficiently nourished owing to extreme poverty. Where the instructions have been carried out the improvement has been very marked. There is something futile, however, in advising these mothers to give their babies so much milk per day, or to feed them upon dried milk with cream, or other suitable fat, when it is quite impossible for them to provide it. Dr. Campbell provided various foods, etc., which were in some cases, where the children were in urgent need of proper food and the mother too poor to provide it, given to the mothers. Dried milk, which is much cheaper in actual use than the fresh article, can be provided at a cost of 5d. per lb. for full cream milk, or 3id. per lb. for skimmed milk, if bought wholesale, but it cannot be procured at the ordinary chemist's shop. The dried skimmed milk is a most excellent food for the pregnant and nursing mothers at a cost of only one penny per day. A knitting club was formed, and instruction given to the mothers in the making of simple woollen vests, by Mrs. Day, who kindly volunteered her services. The needles and sufficient wool to make one vest were given to each mother who wished to learn, and when one vest was completed a further supply of wool was provided, for which the mothers pay at the rate of one penny per week, each vest costing about threepence. The knitting has so far proved popular and successful. A cradle made from a banana case has been provided by Miss MacColl, at a cost of 1/3½, which includes a mattress or bed, and a pillow. This is used for demonstrating the need for a separate bed or cot, and the cheapest and simplest method of providing a clean and healthy cradle. 34 Arrangements are being made for patterns of the most suitable kinds of baby clothes to be obtained, and we are hoping to give instructions in the cutting out and making of these garments. The results of any work of this sort must necessarily be very slow as any innovation is looked upon with suspicion, and the apathy of the mothers generally is very difficult to overcome, and to awaken interest in these things is not an easy matter. 36 VITAL STATISTICS OF THE WARDS. 36 VITAL STATISTICS OF THE WARDS. Not much importance attaches this year to the Ward Vital Statistics as they are the first submitted in respect of the new wards, and are calculated upon data which it is very desirable should be replaced by the ascertained facts of a census return.

There were notified during the year altogether 587 cases of infectious disease. This gives a notification rate of 3.8 per 1,000, the lowest notification rate experienced since the Act came into force. SMALL POX. Yet another year, the sixth in succession of freedom from small pox, has to be recorded. The proportion of surviving infants who remain unvaccinated has steadily risen from 27 per cent, in the smallpox years to 48 per cent, in 1910, while the number of conscientious objectors to vaccination has, during the same period, risen from 3.0 for every 100 children vaccinated to 34.8. Long continued freedom from smallpox, associated with increased neglect of vaccination are doubtless correlative facts, the correct formulation of which it is hopeless to expect will be accepted until the evidence has again enforced its recognition in the tragic terms of a smallpox epidemic. No disease is so certainly preventible as smallpox, none in which the measures of prevention have received so wide and uniform consent among those best qualified to speak, and yet to-day one half our population is growing up wholly unprotected from a disease which, in these circumstances, should it once establish a footing, will spread with an appalling ferocity of which we have no modern parallel.

When it is considered that there has been experienced in the past a rate of mortality from this cause that would on the present population have yielded nearly 200 deaths from this disease, the modifications in its epidemic character during 1910 will be appreciated. The number of cases notified was 314 giving the lowest notification rate from scarlet fever yet experienced and with the exception of the year 1894, the smallest actual number of cases notified since notification came in force. It must not, however, be assumed that this represents the conquest of the disease by administrative measures. It would be gratifying to think that all the effort expended in combatting scarlet fever had at last met its reward in so satisfying a result. Unfortunately the spread of the disease is determined by conditions still largely unknown and so far not subject to those preventive measures which our present knowledge enables us to take with not unnotable measure of success. But scarlet fever during 1910 ha* been both less infectious and less virulent than usual. The activity of the infection is at a low ebb and this it the interpretation to be placed upon the figures which are the record of its behaviour. It is claimed that they have justified the postponement of the hospital extensions which with the prevalence experienced in recent years and the increase of the population were in my opinion called for The extent of hospital provision is a question of the probability of demand based on results of wide experience. A passing and happy failure in the insistence of these demands, should it coincide with an economy on hospital extension, is a fortunate coincidence, which properly viewed is ground for unqualified rejoicing. 47 But it would be a dangerous error to assume that a fortunate accident will justify an indefinite postponement of action which the permanent probabilities call for. To hazard security because good fortune has chanced to attend a compromise with the unknown is an indifferent return for the favour upon which occasional reliance is haply entitled to be placed. 48 RETURN CASES OF SCARLET FEVER.

The "infecting cases" giving rise to "return cases" of scarlet fever are not improbably the main reservoirs from which, under suitable seasonal and cyclical epidemic conditions, are drawn the unrecognised foci of epidemic prevalence. DIPHTHERIA. It is not a little remarkable that the year which lias seen a unique record as regards the prevalence and type of scarlet fever, should be the year in which the lowest rate of incidence of diphtheria should also fall to be recorded. The number of cases notified was 166, the incidence rate 1.1 per 1,000, the number of deaths 11. TYPHOID FEVER. Twenty-three cases only of typhoid fever were notified, the smallest number since the notification Act came into operation. The fatality rate, 8 7 per cent., is also exceptionally low. So far as Zymotic diseases are concerned the year has been remarkable. MEASLES. The statistical results of enquiries into cases of measles coming to knowledge as a result of notification by the head teachers of the public elementary schools, are given in the following tables. 1 do not purpose to offer any comment at present upon these results. 50 Table 25.

The sewage of the Brent area is still treated at the Sewage Works, but the work of constructing the sewers by which the sewage of the Brent area, like that of the Metropolitan area, shall discharge into the Metropolitan sewers has commenced, and it is hoped that in the course of 1911, the whole of the sewage of Willesden will discharge into the sewers of the London County Council. COMMON LODGING HOUSES. The two Common Lodging Houses in the district are kept under constant supervision, and always found to be kept in a cleanly condition, and conducted in a satisfactory manner. Additional accommodation was made to the Common Lodging House in South Kilburn during the year 1909, but no application has yet been received for registration of the new addition..

During the year 35 notices were served in pursuance of Section 15 of the above Act, and 6 notices in pursuance of Section 10, in respect of properties in the undermentioned roads. In 40 instances the notices were duly complied with, making the houses reasonably fit for human habitation, and in one instance no further action was taken by the Local Authority owing to the premises being scheduled for demolition by a railway company. In four instances notices were served under Section 17, closing the premises as unfit for human habitation. Disraeli Road (12 houses). Brett Road (8 houses). Bourke Road. Earlsmead Road.

The importance of milk as an article of diet practically indispensable in childhood makes the supervision of the conditions under which it is produced, distributed and stored one of the chief concerns of sanitary administration. COWSHEDS. There are seven cowsheds in Willesden, of these two are situated in the urbanised portion of the district, viz., one at South Kilburn and the other at Willesden Green, the other five are in the more outlying or rural parts of the district. During the year they have all been visited on several occasions. Early in the year structural works of importance entailing a considerable expenditure of money were carried out in two instances, thus effecting a most marked improvement in the structural condition of the cowsheds. These works were rendered the more necessary owing to the replacement of horse-keeping by dairy farming, a change which has naturally followed in the rural environment of London by the growth of motor traffic and consequent decline of horse traction. 62 Table No. 34.

These by no means fulfil uanitary requirements. Persons wholly unacquainted with the rudiments of scientific cleanliness and incapable of distinguishing the grosser forms of filthy practices in which the untrained and incapable indulge, are entitled to be registered as milk vendors and to pursue a calling for which they are fitted neither by training nor natural capacity. Milk as a medium for the distribution of ingestible filth is probably unsurpassed by any other article of diet, and is likely to remain so until some standard of qualification is demanded from those who are registered as persons entitled to engage in the trade. 63 MILK FROM TUBERCULOUS COWS. The following table shows the results of examinations of samples of milk for tubercle bacilli. TABLE showing Results of Examining Samples of Milk for Tubercle Bacilli, taken in Willesden during 1910.

The first sample showed the presence of tubercle bacilli in a mixed sample of milk, the second the presence of the organisms in a sample drawn direct from the c »w which was the source of infection of the mixed milk from the herd. It is interesting to note that one sample taken from the herd of a Willesden cow-keeper was found to be infected by a cow kept specially for "nursery milk." The cow was a "good milker," and yielded an abundant supply, which was mainly reserved for infants who were believed to be benefited by being fed on the milk of one cow, instead of on the mixed milk, which constitutes the common supply. Cow-keepers are genuinely surprised when they are informed that their milk is infected with tubercle, and are most anxious to take all necessary steps, even at the cost of serious monetary loss to themselves, to rid their herds of tubercular cattle. 64 But, unfortunately, they are only likely to acquire the knowledge which will save them from the direct positive loss which open tuberculosis in their herds entails, when it is brought home to them by a personal experience which an intelligent anticipation would avoid. TUBERCULOUS MEAT. As far back as the middle of 1908, a butcher in the district was suspcctod of carrying 011 the trade on other than legitimate lines. This suspicion was subsequently confirmed by a working butcher, who called at the office and affirmed that a man living at Stanmore (a knacker) was supplying the local butcher with the meat of diseased cattle, or of animals killed "to save them from dying." Instructions were given that the shop of the butcher in question should be kept under strict observation, and from time to time freshly killed beef was seen hanging up, but already cut up into small joints, rendering detection very difficult, and in fact, destroying whatever evidence of disease may have been present. The shop was entered 011 many occasions, but without discovery of anything justifying seizure. With the view of allaying suspicion, supervision by the Inspector was withdrawn for a period. On the Inspector paying a surprise visit to the shop on Sunday morning, the 13th November, 1910, he found in a meat-safe a carcase of beef, cut up into quarters, and also the head and liver. On examining the head the pharyngeal glands were found to be extensively affected with tubercular deposits. The portal glands of the liver were also affected. The pleura of the left forequarter had been stripped, presumably with the purpose of destroying evidence of disease. The supra-sternal glands were enlarged and caseous, and a large tubercular nodule was found under the second dorsal vertebra. The lungs and other viscera were absent. Sufficient evidence, however, was present to enable an opinion to be formed that the disease was that of generalized tuberculosis. 65 The carcase was seized in pursuance of Sec. 116, P.H. Act, 1875, and taken before a Justice of the Peacc, who made an order for its condemnation, and the carcase was incinerated. The Council authorised proceedings to be taken against the butcher, and also against the person who supplied the carcase. The case was heard on the 24th November, at the Willesden Police Court, the proceedings being taken under Sec. 117 of the P.H. A. 1875. The defendant was found guilty of contravening the section, and a penalty of £10 was imposed. Subsequently at the same Court, the knacker who supplied the carcase to the defendant, was summoned at the instance of the Council. Proceedings were taken under Sec. 5 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1848, for unlawfully aiding and abetting the commission of the offence of having on the premises the carcase of a cow for the purpose of preparation for sale, and intended for the food of man. The Chairman, in summing up said, that from the point of view of the public, this was a very important case. It had been clearly proved that the defendant had guilty knowledge of the condition of the carcase by reason of the fact that he took every precaution to conceal traces of the disease. He, therefore, in this case also imposed a penalty of £10 and costs. 66 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

At the other five there are killed regularly both bullocks and sheep. The premises are visited frequently while the killing is in progress, and during the year the following carcases and organs were seized as diseased, and destroyed as being unfit for food.

F 72 SANITARY CONDITION OF WORKSHOPS WHERE WOMEN ARE EMPLOYED. During the year 1910 all the Laundries on the Register were inspected and, where necessary, re-inspected and kept under observation until the defects were remedied. On the whole the laundries were found to be in a fairly satisfactory condition. In 5 cases the washhuuse floors needed to be more efficiently drained; and cleansing was required and other defects were discovered in a number of instances. The stoves used for heating the irons in the workshop laundries are in many cases inadequately screened. Notification of this contravention of the Factory and Workshop Act has been made to His Majesty's Inspector of Factories. The dressmaking and other workshops where women are employed are for the most part satisfactory. A large number of these—38 in all—have been discontinued since 1909, and a number of new workrooms have been registered. Infectious disease occurred, on two occasions during the year, in premises occupied by dressmakers. The patients were removed to hospital, and the necessary disinfection was carried out. There is still a tendency, especially amongst dressmakers, to employ assistants in their workrooms to the utmost limit of the air space. In three cases overcrowding was discovered ; this was abated in each case after informal notice had been given to the occupier of the respective rooms. Very few outworkers are employed by the occupiers of workrooms in this district. Many of the workshops take work from factories and shops during the slack periods ot the year for private work, thus becoming outworker as well as workshop premises. This enables the occupier of the workshop to retain workers who would otherwise be put ofl' until the busy season. 73 The work clone by the actual Home Workers is very intermittent and is usually done to supplement the income and not as a means of livelihood. The conditions under which the work is done are usually ver}' satisfactory, but the outworkers, generally speaking, are wanderers, working only for short periods, and constantly changing their dwelling places. 41 outworkers have removed or given up work since 1909. F 2 74 BAKEHOUSES. During the year, in addition to the usual systematic inspections, all the bakehouses have been made the subject of a night inspection during working hours. It is very desirable that this should be done periodically, for while during the day-time it is possible to inspect the premises and to see that they are in a reasonably sanitary condition, having regard to the purpose for which they are used, it does not follow that sanitary conditions are maintained even when facilities for their attainment are amply afforded. This is well illustrated in the attitude of the bakers towards the provision of lavatories. The provision of lavatories was insisted upon in the case of underground bakehouses as a condition of the certificate of the Council necessary for their continuance after 1903 as required by the Factory and Workshop Act of 1901. In the course of inspection it is found that a very large proportion of the lavatories are unprovided with soap or towels, and present other evidence of not being used. In extenuation the bakers urge that it is too much to expect of them to go out of a hot bakehouse at night in a half-clothed condition and wash in a cold lavatory where they would be exposed to severe chill, and they prefer to wash in a bucket in the bakehouse itself. Unconsciously they reveal the fact that the use of the lavatory precedent to baking is not a usual practice, and that washing is a process rendered necessary chiefly by the adhesive qualities of flour and dough when brought into contact with hands and arms. 75 Again, it has been found that very few of the bakers wear overalls—clean or otherwise—although this is a simple sanitary precaution which cannot be compensated for by the most perfectlyequipped bakehouse. Flour stores have been provided in connection with most of the bakehouses, but one quite frequently finds the bakehouse encumbered with stacks of Hour sacks which not only encroach seriously upon the cubic space of the bakehouse, but are a source of dirt and dust most undesirable in a work-placc devoted to the preparation of food for human consumption. One of the grossest instances of misuse of bakehouse premises I have yet come across I reported in 1909. Some preserved plums and cherries had been set to drain into the pan of a w.c. which was choked and full of faeces and filth. TEMPERATURE AND VENTILATION. Facilities for efficient ventilation are present in all the bakehouses, but owing to the necessity of maintaining a high temperature in the bakehouse during the time the dough is “rising,” permanent ventilation becomes a misnomer. Sacks and other obstructions are placed over any openings provided with a view to admitting fresh air to the bakehouse. A temperature of not less than 70° F. is desired at this stage, and even the rapid opening and closing of a door to admit an inspector is then keenly resented. It will be seen from the tables that temperatures considerably in excess of the requirements of the manufacturing process were not infrequently observed. Structurally, the facilities for ventilation in bakehouses are generally sufficient. In the case of underground bakehouses, provision for through ventilation was insisted upon in all instances, and very considerable structural improvements were effected in this class of bakehouse in order to comply with this requirement. 16 LIGHTING. As will he seen from the Table setting out the details with regard to natural lighting, several of the bakehouses are not well lighted, though, speaking generally, there is not much to complain of in this respect. In the case of Underground Bakehouses it was insisted upon that the lighting should be sufficient to enable the official copy of the Abstract to be read in all parts of the bakehouse without the aid of artificial light. The lighting, in all cases, however, was in excess of this minimum requirement. Artificial lighting is effected chiefly by the ordinary bat wing burner, incandescent mantles not infrequently being regarded with disfavour owing to the undue risks of damage to which they are subject in a bakehouse. CLEANLINESS, STRUCTURE AND REPAIR. In Table A below is given an analysis based on all the inspections of bakehouses made since 1903 in respect of the cleanliness and repair of walls, floors and ceilings. I am satisfied that not too high a standard has been adopted by the inspectors in classifying the results. I am of opinion that, in a trade engaged in the preparation of food for human consumption, a higher standard, especially of cleanliness, than that which generally obtains among bakers is desirable. Most of the underground bakehouses are subject unduly to the entrance of dust from the streets. Lighting and ventilation is effected in part at least in most of them by a window made to open beneath the shop window, and an opening so near to the street level inevitably admits an undue amount of street dust. This was recognised when the alterations to underground bakehouses were carried out, but appears to be unavoidable if efficient ventilation of underground bakehouses is to be made available. 7? DRAINAGE. The drainage of premises used as bakehouses in this district may be described as satisfactory. Prior to 1904 several of the underground bakehouses were subject to flooding from sewage when the sewers were surcharged. I have on such occasions seen a batch of dough lying several inches deep in sewage, while sacks of Hour standing on the Hoor have shared a similar fate. Before certifying such bakehouses, the Council had to be satisfied that efficient means were taken to prevent a recurrence of such a condition. The steps taken appear in all instances to have been effective ; in fact, so successful have they been, that the system which I recommended at the time has been extended to many other premises similarly subject to flooding from sewage. EFFECT UPON HEALTH. It is not probable, from anything which inspection has revealed, that any serious danger to the health of the consumer is incurred as a consequence of the process of bread manufacture, or of the conditions under which it is carried on. For practical purposes, bread as it leaves the oven is a sterilised product, and is not of a character likely either from its nature or its risks of exposure to become the medium of distribution of any of the pathogenic organisms ordinarily met with in this country. But the sentiment which demands clean food is sound, and there is good reason why, in eating bread, people should not consume dirt, especially in quantities that rapidly attain to the proverbial peck. It has to be admitted that the conditions under which bread is habitually made fail to exclude even to a reasonable extent the admixture of mechanical and chemical dirt from our loaves. 78 Turning from the consumer to the producer, if so the journeyman baker may be described, the influence of the conditions under which bread is made, is different. It is impossible not to be struck with the white " pasty " faces of journeymen bakers. Whatever significance attaches to the pallor of bakers, the fact of its prevalence is unquestionable. Whether it is due to a true anæmia or is merely a pigment modification I am unable to say. There can, however, be no question that the conditions under which bakers carry on their employment are responsible for bakers' pallor. For the most part bakers work during the night and sleep during the day. Well lighted and ventilated bakehouses in many instances are wholly unoccupied while in this satisfactory sanitary condition. The work of the baker is performed when natural lighting is in abeyance, when ventilation under existing conditions is incompatible with the maintainance of a temperature necessary to the trade process, in an atmosphere which is maintained at tropical heat and which is charged with the vapours given off from the oven and from human bodies working in a semi-nude condition at a temperature which stimulates exhalation. Added to this, is the fact that the bakehouse is a dusty workroom and even though the dust be comparatively innocuous, the total of the conditions can hardly be described as those of a healthy trade. In the small retail bakehouse it does not seem possible that the vicissitudes of temperature and the periodic intensification of atmospheric impurities should be wholly avoided. 79 How far the provision of a specially heated fermentation chamber or of dough troughs would be practicable I am not prepared to say, but if it were, it would remove the chief obstacle to the maintenance in the workroom of a more equable temperature, and of a reasonable standard of atmospheric purity. SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. The statutory enactments with regard to bakehouses lack chiefly, in my opinion, in their omission to confer on Local Authorities the power to make Bye-laws or Regulations controlling the conduct of the trade. The proper storage of flour and the other ingredients which go to the composition of bread and bake meats, the handling and storage of the food stuffs themselves, the cleanliness of the person, utensils and bakeroom, the prevention of uncleanly habits such as spitting in the bakeroom, are among the matters which can best be dealt with by the preparation of a model set of regulations or bye-laws to be adopted or modified by the L.A. responsible for the sanitary supervision of workplaces where food is prepared for human consumption. Again, it is important that the sanitary condition of above-ground bakehouses should not fall below that of those situated under-ground ; but it has not been found possible in all cases to secure this result, although an attempt with inadequate powers has been made, in many cases, it is a pleasure to admit, with complete success. It should at least be possible to insist that the minimum standard of sanitary requirements generally accepted as a condition of certifying underground bakehouses under Section 101 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, should be made applicable to bakehouses situated above ground. 80 If, in addition to this and the granting of powers to Local Authorities to make bye-laws, it were further provided that the fermentation process should be conducted under conditions in which the general temperature of the bakehouse might be maintained within reasonable limits, much would be done to remove the unsatisfactory conditions incidental to the manufacture of bread-stuffs.

The chief merit of the system lies in the fact that each department of each school is visited one day in each week by a Medical Officer "responsible for the health of the children in its fullest sense, and not narrowly interested in the performance of certain duties only which are specifically allotted as a necessary minimum to be discharged." It is a pleasure to report that the spirit of this description of their duties has been characteristic of the manner in which they have been discharged. In the month of November a conference of the Assistant School Medical Officers was called to discuss with the School Medical Officer suggested amendments of regulations relating to the administration which is organised and centred in the department of the School Medical Officer. Agreement was reached upon all the points raised, and these were subsequently submitted to a conference of the Head Teachers, who endorsed in all essential particulars the draft regulations submitted. Unfortunately, since this agreement as to the changes in the regulations which the organisation of medical inspection has necessitated has been arrived at, it has not been found possible for the Regulations Committee to meet, and so the regulations in question still, await authoritative sanction. The following table shows the principle on which children have been selected for inspection:— 1. Children five years of age and under. 2. Children of other ages admitted lo school for the first time—not transfers. 3. Children aged 7 but not yet 8 years of age. 4. Children aged 10 but not yet 11 years of age. 5. Children aged 13 years and over. 6. Children of other ages "leaving school"—not transfers. 7. Children (at any age) specially referred by school teachers. 12 Table showing actual number of children inspected (classified for age at date of inspection and for sex). Age. Boys.

The general results of medical inspection approximate very closely to those of the year 1909, so far as these may be judged from the statistical returns. The variations from the statistical results of last year are in fact remarkably inconspicuous. The standard of cleanliness of skin and head has deviated very little from that ascertained during the first year of inspection. Verminous heads are very slightly more frequent in boys, but in girls there has been an improvement to the extent of 2 per cent. In both there is a slight increase in the occurrence of body vermin, a comparatively infrequent condition which calls for the exercise of more drastic powers than are at present possessed. Under the Children Act, the cleansing of the verminous children may be carried out under somewhat cumbersome conditions, but no powers are given to cleanse the other members of the family, who are almost invariably in these cases verminous also. It is, of course, a mere waste of time to cleanse the children and send them back to verminous homes where they become straightway re-infected. Wherever children have been cleansed under the Children Act, an offer has been made to cleanse the other inmates of the home, together with the bedding and clothing, but in all instances this offer has been emphatically refused. As no power can be exercised to compel cleansing of the person of adults, even when verminous conditions are known to exist, permanent foci for the spread of vermin are established in the schools attended by these children. Exclusion of the children and prosecution of the parents for non-attendance is a palliative by no means satisfactory. Recurring fines are paid, but no attempt to remove the cause is made. The repeated exclusions interfere seriously with the education of the child, the fines cripple the already insufficient resources of 20 the parents, the evil remains unabated, and the whole procedure is most disheartening to all engaged in the effort at amelioration. The liberty of the subject in such cases amounts to no less than a licence to diff use a loathsome form of verminous infestation, which would not be countenanced were the results less disgusting but more dangerous to life. The remedy is obvious, but statutory powers are necessary for its application. It consists in the forcible seizure and cleansing of persons known to be persistently verminous, and the penalizing of the condition by less irrational forms than fining. ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY THE TEACHERS. I have again to express my appreciation of the whole-hearted co-operation of the teachers in all matters having for their object improvement of the health of the school children. In the table on page 27, details as to the extent of this cooperation are given ; the Assistant School Medical Officers, almost all of them, speak most highly of the assistance rendered, and it is certainly exceptional to find a head teacher lacking in seconding any of the efforts called for as the outcome of medical inspection. PARENTS. Parents were present at 48 % of the inspections of boys, and at 60 % of girls. When not present, information as to infectious illnesses from which the child has suffered is sent on the printed forms supplied for the purpose. A few parents, amounting in all to 137, are still found to object to the medical inspection of their children. In some cases it is certain that such objections arise from fear that conditions betraying neglect of the child should be discovered. Medical inspection generally, however, is rightly looked upon by the parents as a privilege conferred in the best interests of the child, and is appreciated accordingly. 21 LADY HEALTH VISITORS. The work arising out of medical inspection is absorbing an increasing proportion of the time of the Lady Health Visitors. The visiting and re-visiting of the cases of infectious diseases notilied from the schools and of the cases specially referred by the Assistant School Medical Officers entails an amount of work which can barely be appreciated from the mere figures returned in the periodical reports. Each visit is the occasion, not merely of the advice given, but of memoranda, and the issue of innumerable forms and notices rendered necessary for the effective administration of the scheme. There is still the same lack of coordination with the work of the Attendance Officers, and the need for regulations to secure uniformity of procedure among all persons taking part in the work of medical inspection. TREATMENT. It is due largely to the efforts of the Health Visitors in following up the cases which the School doctors think require continued supervision in order that treatment shall be carried out, that such results as it is possible to record have been achieved. It is true that most of the defects found upon medical inspection do receive the attention of the parents upon the representation of the school doctor alone. There remain, after all efforts have been made, a large number of cases of physical defect and disease which are allowed to go from bad to worse, to remain untreated and uncured, or to get well as hap will have it. For a considerable proportion of these, provision for treatment is required, for others, direct powers of statutory compulsion. The utterly neglectful parents are not numerous, expressed as a proportion, but they cause an infinite deal of trouble with little to see for it, and they bulk much more prominently on this account in the administrative eye. Perhaps the most urgent provision is that for the care of the teeth. Decay of dental tissue is extremely prevalent, and its effect on general health is very important on the one hand, while on the other, familiarity has bred such contempt, that the most widespread defect receives the most universal neglect. The whole question of treatment is receiving the attention of a special sub-committee appointed to consider the matter. The following table shows the result of enquiry into the cases specially referred to the School Medical Officer. Cases dealt with as a result of reference from Assistant School Medical Officers of children suitable for domiciliary visitation by the Lady Health Visitors, 1910. Condition needing attention.

The number of cases thus dealt with is shown in the following table:— TABLE SHOWING CONTAGIOUS AFFECTIONS DEALT WITH AS OUT-PATIENTS. Disease. Total Number of Cases seen primarily.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES DEALT WITH AS A RESULT OF NOTIFICATIONS FROM THE SCHOOLS. In the following tables are given the numbers of cases of infectious disease which, while not statutorily notifiable, have come to knowledge as a result of school notification. The accumulated knowledge which has resulted in consequence of the enquiries rendered possible by this system of notification has proved of great value, not only in controlling attendance, and in enabling decisions as to the advisability of school closure to be arrived at, but also in elucidating many of the natural epidemiological features of these diseases which are a precondition of more effective measures for their control. 24 Number of Medical Inspections Completed, and Infectious and Contagious Diseases Notified from Public Elementary Schools during 1910:— NAME OF SCHOOL (Provided).

In addition to repeating the tables published in the Annual Report of last year, comparative tables collected from observations taken over a wider area are given, and a new table is added giving the weight at each age for each centimetre of height. These tables become more valuable the greater the number of observations on which they are based, but even in the limited observations relating to particular schools the rough classification of social conditions which they represent exhibits the results of these conditions in the comparative heights and weights of the scholars. 32 TABLE SHOWING HEIGHTS (in Centimetres) AND WEIGHTS (in Kilogrammes) OF CHILDREN IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF ENGLAND.

The relationship between the cleanliness of the School-room floor and the purity of the air in the room will be seen by the most cursory observation to be very intimate. Whoever has seen the sweeping of an ordinary floor, and has observed the clouds of dust ejected by the broom into the atmosphere, must have been impressed with the grossly insanitary, uncomfortables, and even disgusting conditions with which the crude domestic attempts at cleanliness are associated. A school-room floor is not an ordinary floor; it is the floor of a room which is intensely occupied during a very considerable period of the waking life of a child. It is in all its parts subject to excessive use. The constant trampling of little feet keeps it in a state of continuous vibration, and subject to innumerable minor waftings which raise its dust and charge the atmosphere with all the varied ingredients which go to the composition of school-room dust. In the newer schools, hard, smooth wood block flooring has minimised materially the exaggeration of these evils to which the older rough soft wood floor boarding lent itself. But to witness in one of our best constructed new schools, the daily sweeping of a periodically washed good conditioned floor, is to realise how far we are from the attainment of sanitary school buildings. There has been a very general recognition of the evils of floor dust, and attempts to mitigate them by the use of chemical disinfectants, deodorants, malodorants, and other misapplications have been advocated extensively in the advertisement columns of the 41 press, and by pushing pseudo-scientific representatives of the firms supplying the quack remedies. It is better if an evil cannot be remedied not to ''do something," but to do nothing. A sham remedy, it may be disguises, but does not lessen the harm which threatens, while by pacifying those alive to the danger, real or supposed, it lulls to a sense of security which is dangerous if the evil is actual and not imaginary. I have for these reasons, having ground for thinking that the vaunted so-called disinfectants as ordinarily applied to school floors were useless, advised that they be not resorted to. I have, however, conducted a number of observations and experiments on the use of a number of dust allaying substances which applied to floors are claimed so to affect the dust as to prevent it from rising and so contaminating the atmosphere even during the most vigorous sweeping. Miss Ethel Cook, the Senior Assistant Lady Health Visitor, has most carefully and skilfully carried out the observations under my direction, and I am indebted to her, not only for the painstaking manner in which this has been done, but for many valuable suggestions in the conduct of the experiments. It was arranged that observations should be made upon good smooth hard wood block floors, and upon rough soft wood boarded flooring. The method ultimately adopted for testing and recording the results was the following : ordinary photographic plates were stripped of their films and immediately before being exposed were coated with a rapidly drying film of mastic varnish. During the whole time when a floor was being swept, these plates were exposed on a school desk near the middle of the room and allowed to remain 42 so exposed for not less than half-an-hour after the sweeping had ceased. The tacky surface of the mastic varnish caused all dust falling on the face of the plate to adhere, and after drying to become fixed. Immediately after exposure the plates were placed in dust-proof boxes until thoroughly dry, and thus a permanent record was secured of the dust actually falling on the plates during the period of exposure. For the purposes intended, it was considered that sufficient accuracy would be attained by classifying the degree of dustiness of the plates according to the following rough scale:— Degree. 0 1 = Practically no dust. 2 = Evident dustiness. 3 - Very dusty. 4 = Excessive dustiness. The tests were carried out as stated above, on hard and on soft wood floors. A control was kept in an adjoining room of the same school as nearly as possible identical with the room in which the dust allayer was used, the plate being exposed for the same period during and after sweeping. The results of the observations are represented graphically in the accompanying diagrams. The stars connected by dotted lines represent the degree of dustiness recorded on the plate while sweeping the untreated floors in the ordinary way and the figures at the top of the diagram represent the number of days which had elapsed since the day on which the floors were last washed and scrubbed. The dots, triangles or small circles connected by the continuous line represent the degree of dustiness recorded on the plate while sweeping 43 the treated floor with a hard broom, and the figures at the bottom of the diagram represent the number of weeks which had elapsed from the day on which the dust allayer was applied. During the whole of the period recorded on the diagrams, the floors treated with the "dust altayer " were unwashed. Of the dust allayers used two, Nos. 2 and 3, were cily substances which it will be seen gave excellent results. The other, No. 1, is more expensive than Nos. 2 and 3 and its effect is much more quickly lost. Turning now to the results, they may be summarised as follows— No. 1 Substance. On a hard wood floor, the restraining influence upon dust is as great at the end of four weeks as floor washing at the end of two days. On a soft wood floor its influence for practical purposes is lost at the end of a fortnight or three weeks, but is better then than floor-washing after two days. No. 2 Substance. On a hard wood floor its effectiveness for nine weeks was absolute. At the end of that period its restraining influence was rapidly lost, but to the end of the 15th week the results are better than those obtained from floor washing after three days, and to the end of the 19th week not worse. On a soft wood floor, the results were less constant, but on one occasion only during 13 weeks was it observed to fail to keep the dust from rising in anything but negligable quantities, and at the end of this period was better than floor washing after two days. b 44 No. 3 Substance. On a hard wood floor at the end of 19 weeks no appreciable dust had been raised during the whole period of observation. On a soft wood floor at the end of 13 weeks the restraining influence was practically unimpaired and was better than floor washing after two days. The effects of oiling floors with substances Nos. 2 and 3 in view of these observations may be described as excellent. Their general application to school-room floors twice or three times a year must mean an immense improvement in the hygienic conditions of the school-room, and be associated with a general raising of the standard of cleanliness. Furniture, walls, windows, and even ceilings will inevitably remain cleaner for a longer period when the air is dirtied to so much lesser a degree, while the work of maintaining the schools in a cleanly condition would be most materially reduced. It remains only to consider the cost entailed in carrying out systematically throughout all the schools, the treatment of floors by this means. The dust allaying substances, Nos. 2 and 3 of the experiments, are proprietary articles, and their manufacturers recommend that the floors be dressed three times in the course of the year, in order to secure the best results. In the case of both substances, the quantities used during the first application, owing to absorption, are much greater than the amount used during the second, and the quantities used during the second greater than that of the third, the ratios being approximately 4, 3 and 2. From this it follows that the cost of adopting this system of floor treatment will be greater in the first than in subsequent years. In the following table I have set out an estimate of the quantities, and of the cost of treating all the floors of Public Elementary Schools in Willesden with Nos. 2 and 3 substances respectively for one year. 45 Name of School.

For the second year I estimate that the quantities and cost would be reduced, as shown in the table. Notwithstanding the manifest advantages possessed by No. 3 as compared with No. 2 substance, so far as can be judged from the comparatively limited experience of the tests, I think it would be well if it is decided to adopt throughout the schools, the method of floor treatment by dust allaying oils, to continue the use of both these applications for at least a year. I suggest that No. 3 sub-stance should be used in, say, two-thirds of the schools, and No. 2 substance in the remainder. By this means full advantage is taken of the competitive efforts of the two firms interested, while an opportunity is afforded them 011 a commercial scale of demonstrating the comparative values of their respective products. Objections. There are two objections to the treatment of floors by dust allaying substances which so far have become apparent. The first is that they are alleged to make the floors slippery. The teachers inform me that on the floors which have been treated there is an increased liability for the children to slip. As a matter of fact, the floors are not nearly so slippery as the stairs and landings, where a slippery state is much more dangerous, and personally, I do not attach much importance to this objection. Attempts to slide the foot over an oiled floor are met with a very marked resistance. The floors in fact are in no way comparable to polished floors. In any case the dangers from dusty class rooms, in my opinion, far outweigh the slightly increased chances of the minor accident of a fall. The second objection is that the floor is rendered darker as a result of the application. This applies more in the case of No. 2 Charts showing destee of dust recorded on plates exposed during ond fot not less than hall an hour after Sweeping of floor, the dotted line in each case representing results of control observations made on an untreated floor. C. Hatd-wood floor after treatment by No 2 substance. E. Hard-wood floor after treatment No 3 substance. 47 than of No. 3 Substance, but does not appear to me to have any serious weight. There are in fact, advantages in a low toned floor which become marked if contrasted with the glare of a light brightly reflecting surface. Comparative Economy. I regret I have not the data that would enable a strict comparison of cost to be made of the two methods of treating school floors, namely, by washing or by oiling. Against the increased cost of oiling, there is to be set off the immediate reduction of floor washing and scrubbing. This is supposed to be carried out once in three weeks throughout all the public elementary schools. There is thus at once a saving in the labour entailed in scrubbing about 30,000 square yards of flooring at these intervals throughout the year. But there is more than this. The clouds of dust which are raised in sweeping an untreated floor settle on everything in the room, and this leads not only to increased dusting, but to more frequent cleansing of walls, ceilings and windows in order to maintain a given standard of cleanliness. I hope, however, that this balance will remain on the side of increased cleanliness. There is, however, a third very important saving, and that is in the economy of the floor itself. Washing not only softens and disintegrates the wood, but by causing it to swell and warp, is most injurious to the best laid floors. The life of a floor will unquestionably be increased by the use of an oil dressing in place of frequent washing And it is unnecessary to labour the advantages offered by an oil dressed floor. Unless further experience belies the anticipations raised by that gained by experiment, there will be a substantial gain not only in the cost and standard of cleanliness in the schools, but in the health of the scholars who have hitherto been subjected in a higher degree than now appears to be necessary to the injurious effects of school-room dust. 48 In the following tables the school buildings are classified as belonging to one or other of six types. These types tnay be described briefly as follows:— Type I.—A simple form of school building consisting of a single room, usually of oblong shape, in which two or more classes are taught in the same room. Type II.—School subdivided into class rooms unprovided with corridors, so that one class room opens directly into another. Type III.—Class rooms open on to a common corridor, the class rooms being arranged on one side only of the corridor which is well lighted and ventilated by windows opening on the opposite side to the outer air. Type IV,—Double rows of class rooms ranged on either side of a common corridor. Type V.—Double rows of class rooms ranged on either side of a Central Hall into which the Central Hall of Type IV. may be considered to have been expanded. Type VI.—Single row of class rooms opening on to Central Hall, the windows of which open on opposite side to the outer air.

On examining children for the second time, I find that defects of nose, throat, and eyes have in most cases been attended to, and that there is great improvement in cleanliness and tidiness of person and dress. Parents have now become aware that medical supervision is being exercised over the pupils at the school, and this induces them to take more care of and thought for the physical well-being of their children at home.

Tidiness and cleanliness remarkably good. Majority have defective teeth calling for treatment. As regards general nutrition there is room for improvement. As a rule children do not have sufficient sleep, and there is a deficiency of milk in their diet. Majority have unhealthy throats and exhibit varying degrees of submaxillary glandular enlargement, due to dietetic errors and insufficient ventilation of the homes. A few are insufficiently clothed for the winter months." 60 GIBBONS ROAD SCHOOL. Degree. Attendance. Clothing. Footgear. Nutrition. Cleanliness of Skin. Do. Head. Do. Body. Mental Condition.

I have had several parents thank me for pointing out defects in the children, of which they were in ignorance. I find that the children come to school cleaner and tidier. For instance, the younger children just entering upon their school career come with clean heads, whereas at the beginning, nearly every child's head was verminous. The parents now realise that a child with a verminous head will be subjected to a strict examination and excluded if necessary. Owing to the recent epidemics of measles and whooping cough, a great deal of time has been devoted to the examination of children returning to school after these illnesses, in order to avoid the least risk of infection."

Continents of A.S.M.O.—Dr. Mitchell says: "The children examined have come up to a very fair standard of health. Serious pathological conditions have been rare, and have been chiefly pulmonary. Carious teeth very frequent. The hair of nearly every boy being cut short, verminous heads are practically non-existent." Comments of A.S.M.O.—Dr. Schaub remarks: "The children I found, on the whole, healthy and well clothed. There is still great difficulty in getting attention paid to cases of defective eyesight, bad teeth, and enlarged tonsils and adenoids." 68 LOWER PLACE & DISRAELI ROAD SCHOOLS. Degree. Attendance.

On the other hand, one finds that a great many 4 instructions to parents' are completely disregarded, especially where defective vision is in question.

Inspection no no no Comments of A.S.M.O.—Dr. Bindley says: "I find that one very salutary effect of the inspections is the spread among the public of knowledge with regard to many removable evils in children, and that their prejudices against having nits pointed out to them and having their children's hair kept short, are gradually being broken down. Tt would undoubtedly be a great help in this direction if one of the object lessons given to children were on vermin—the life history of the various forms, and the means of their extermination." Comments of A.S.M.O.—Dr. Greeves says: "I have found by experience that the only way to keep the children clean in a poor neighbourhood is by periodic inspection of the whole school. Since I have done this the improvement is most gratifying." He is of opinion that there is the need for notification of measles, the removal of cases to the Isolation Hospital, and the disinfection of homes, the power to compel parents to have the necessary operation (dental, throat, etc.) done.

The directions given for treatment are not carried out in a very satisfactory manner. For instance, in the one school, in 60 per cent. of the cases of defective eyesight no notice was taken, and of the remainder who went to the hospital and were ordered glasses, not more than half obtained them, and several of these discarded them after a short time."

To the Chairman and Councillors of the Willesden Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Eighth Annual Report, which deals with the work at your Hospital for the year 1910. It is gratifying to note that as compared with recent years the number of patients admitted is small, and is lower than that of any year since 1900. To a certain extent this favourable circumstance may be attributed to the good effects of the isolation treatment of infectious cases, but, it is possible that it is more accurately ascribed to the diminished incidence, during the last year and more, of infectious disease within the district. From the returns of the Metropolitan Asylums Board it would seem that Districts in London have been affected in a similar manner, the number of 4 admissions to the Board's Hospitals showing a reduction of one third on that of the previous year. The total number of admissions for the vear was 437, as compared with 775 in 1909, and 854 in 1908. These 437 cases were admitted suffering from the following diseases :— Scarlet Fever, 228. In 1909 there were 524 Diphtheria, 134. ,, ,, 160 Enteric Fever, 11. ,, ,, 29 Other Diseases 64. ,, ,, .62 437 775 Amongst the 437 cases there were 16 deaths. Diphtheria accounted for 10 deaths, Enteric Fever for 1, and "other diseases" for 5, but there was not a single death from Scarlet Fever. In 1909 there were 33 deaths, and 16 of these were due to Scarlet Fever. The average daily number of patients under treatment was 50.5. In 1909 the average was 1047. 5 Average daily number of patients in Hospital 1904 69.2 1905 73.6 1906 103.5 1907 98.6 1908 108.0 1909 104.7 1910 50.5 The average stay of patients in hospital was for Scarlet Fever 46.5 days. Diphtheria 33.3 „ Enteric Fever 47.4 ,, " Other Diseases" 36.1 ,, For all the diseases taken together the average was 40 4 days, as compared with 39-4 days in 1909. Owing to the fact that such a small number of cases were admitted it was not found necessary to open the Kingsbury Hospital at any time during the year. 6 TABLE No. I. Disease.

From table No. 1 it will be seen that Scarlet Fever was the most prevalent disease, the number of cases admitted, however, was very small as compared with 1909, when there were 524 cases. The diminution in Diphtheria cases was not so appreciable, the admissions for that disease being 134, as compared with 160 in the preceding year. 9 TABLE No. 3. SCARLET FEVER. AGE. MALES. females.

In addition to the ordinary notifiable diseases, cases suffering from certain other infectious ailments were admitted.

These cases were admitted as the Medical Officer of Health, having regard to the circumstances attending them at their homes, deemed it advisable they should be removed to hospital. Cases wrongly diagnosed amounted to 51. In table No 6 the disease they were certified as, and that from which they proved to be suffering from, is shown.

The health of the Staff was fairly satisfactory. Although there were fewer members off duty during the year, they were incapacitated for a slightly longer period. The average number of days off duty being 15.1, as compared with 13.9 days in 1909. Two Nurses and one member of the Male Staff contracted Diphtheria. All made good recoveries. I regret, however, to report the death of Assistant Nurse Lillian Hibben, who succumbed 16 to a severe altack of Typhoid Fever, no doubt contracted whilst attending to patients suffering from that complaint. HOSPITAL EXPENDITURE. Having regard to the fact that a special return will in future be issued from the Accountant's Department, it is no longer necessarv to append, as in past years, the statement in respect to the Hospital Expenditure. In conclusion, I beg to tender my thanks to the Chairman (Mr. E. W. Bridges Hutt), and to the Members of the Committee for their encouragement and support throughout the year. I would also take this opportunity of thanking all the Members of the Staff for their great assistance and loyalty. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. J. J. STEWART. May 1st, 1911, APPENDIX III. Willesden Urban District Council. HOUSING, TOWN PLANNING, ETC., ACT, 1909. REPORT BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, In compliance with an instruction of the Public Health Committee of the last Council, I have the honour to submit a report on the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. It is probably not desired that I should make an exhaustive survey of the Act, and I purpose addressing myself only to its most salient features. 2 TOWN PLANNING. I would premise by saying that the value of intentional and intelligent town planning as distinguished from accidental agglomeration of separately designed centres of development having no common aim or unity of civic purpose is nowhere more definitely illustrated than in the growth of Willesden. A glance at the map which shows the existing distribution of houses makes it clear that the causes which have determined the lines of development within the area emerge only by accident in a somewhat heterogeneous town from which unity of design is conspicuously absent. A suburban district, topographically, but not administratively within the London area, housing a large population to whom easy access to the metropolis is in great part a vital necessity, Willesden has developed naturally along the lines of freest communication with London. Around the stations of the London and North Western, the North London and Metropolitan Railways and along the main roads running into London 3 houses have been built and estates laid out with little reference to other considerations than those of transit. By the good fortune of its recent growth and the operation of the building bye-laws modern houses complying for the most part with current notions of sanitary equipment have been erected, but the streets have arranged themselves at the discretion of the landowners who have laid out their estates not unnaturally in the circumstances with a view to the maximum advantage of their particular holdings rather than by concerted plan to the harmonious development of the district as a whole. As a result estates laid out clearly with the object of housing a residential population have so far as their original purpose is concerned, in course of time been blighted by the discordant ambitions of adjoining owners. Houses constructed for one class of occupiers who appear perpetually to be tieeing the results of this disjointedness of purpose, thus come to be occupied by another to whose needs they are as ill 4 adapted as the perverted intention of their occupancy is calculated to ensure. Everywhere there is a lack of persistent and pervading purpose in the planning of our towns. The intentions of one owner frustrate those of his neighbour, with the result that economic, utilitarian, aesthetic, and hygienic considerations seem to have been grudgingly included in the scheme of things which comprehends the growth of towns. Nor until the passing of the Act of 1909 was it possible in this country that it should be otherwise. TOWN PLANNING IN GERMANY. This Act may be said to owe its origin in part, at least, to the growing consciousness and uneasy sense of contrast arising from comparison of British towns with their Continental sisters. The planning of German towns has perhaps attracted the greatest amount of attention in this country. Commissions have been sent out to study the methods and results which characteristically are exhibited in the towns of Germany. The power to plan out the land at the growing edge of a town has 5 been possessed by the German Municipalities for over thirty years. The extension plans made by the municipalities have to receive the approval of the Government, but before such official extension plans which apply only to small areas are proceeded with, a general draft plan of the whole area within the town boundary is prepared, on which are shown the most suitable sites for open spaces, public buildings, lines of approach, and intercommunication between areas, etc. The familiar boulevards and tree-shaded avenues radiating from or encircling the Continental towns are alone possible where the Central Authority is possessed of planning powers such as are here indicated. Towns extension under these circumstances proceeds with a due regard to the hygienic and other civic amenities. The hap-hazard growth around chance lines of communication is replaced by intentional provision of streets, whose width, direction, and construction is adapted to a development which is foreseen, planned, and ordered with an eye directed solely to the needs of the community. Parks and open spaces, provided 6 at the public cost, may not be isolated or made difficult of access, at the caprice of an owner whose strip of land chances to intersect a street following the direct avenue of approach of a large neighbouring community. School sites may be selected before the areas for which they are required become covered with houses and the few remaining vacant plots, which are available, have acquired a value which makes the provision of schools a much costlier and more difficult matter than need be. APPLICATION TO WILLESDEN. From considerations such as these it will be appreciated what local authorities have gained by their endowment with the powers embraced in Sect. 54 to 67 of Pt. II. of the Housing and Town Planning Act. The preparation of such a plan as the Council are, subject to the consent of the Local Government Board, empowered to make under Sect. 54 of the Act, will necessarily be a prolonged and onerous task, in which the technical knowledge and 7 considered advice of every responsible officer of the Council will obviously call for consideration. Because of this, and because it is desirable that the large tracts of land in Willesden “in course of development or likely to be used for building purposes” should become subject to comprehensive and systematic planning, it suggests itself that a convenient course to pursue would be to appoint a Housing and Town Planning Committee, which, together with the officers, should investigate the local circumstances and requirements of Willesden extension, and report to the Council as to how these requirements could best be met in any scheme which the Council might then decide should be prepared. CO-OPERATION OF OWNERS. It is to be noted in this connection that provision is made in the Act, Sect. 56, Sub-Sect. 2—“for securing co-operation on the part of the Local Authority with the owners and other persons interested in the land proposed to be included in the scheme at every stage of the proceedings by means 8 of conferences and such other means as may be provided by the regulations.” In Germany it has been found that generally the property owner has recognised the wisdom of town extension plans. There, many of the municipalities have secured parliamentary powers enabling them to pool the land and to redistribute it between the different owners. By this means the cutting of wide avenues—which not uncommonly in large towns may attain a width of 150 feet—does not penalise the owners through whose land the avenues are cut. It is even possible —and in fact is arranged—in the case of streets traversing the face of a slope, to build on one side only of a street, so that the streets are terraced one above another in such a manner that a beautiful prospect is unmarred for any of the houses built on the slope. COMPENSATION CLAUSES. Although no such powers of pooling the land appear to have been granted in the Act, it is to be noted that Sect. 58 provides for compensation in respect of property injuriously affected by the scheme 9 and conversely for recovery of a moiety of the value from any person whose property is increased in value as a result of the making of a town planning scheme. Moreover, Sect. 60 of the Act enables the responsible Authority, for the purpose of a town planning scheme, to purchase any land comprised in such scheme and the judicious exercise of this power together with those powers under the compensation clauses just referred to should when applied to such a town as Willesden enable its further extension to proceed under a comprehensive plan which while conserving and protecting private interests, does no injustice to those great civic rights and aspirations which are certain to dominate our newer towns. The garden cities and suburbs which are springing into existence are competitive factors which cannot be ignored by those older communities which have hitherto been handicapped by the lack of those comprehensive powers of planning which the designers of the model towns possess. Most of the fine trees which the centuries had bequeathed and which judicious planning would have 10 preserved to Willesden have been felled. In the garden cities less bountifully supplied their preservation is an object of the designer. The Housing and Town Planning Act has come late for Willesden, but not too late to preserve much of the natural beauty which unimaginative and unordered development would otherwise unquestionably destroy. APPLICATION TO EXISTING HOUSES. I have dealt first with Pt. II. of the Act, because as I have said it is to a rapidly developing district such as Willesden, a measure of the first importance. But there are provisions in other parts of the Act which while of narrower import, effect radical changes of procedure in respect of unhealthy dwellings which should prove of great utility. Section 14 imposes upon landlords an obligation to which they were subject under the Principal Act (Housing of Working Classes Act, 1890, Sect. 75) only in respect of houses let at a rent not exceeding the sum named as the limit for the composition of 11 rates—£8 for the Poor Rate and £10 for the General District Rate—by Sect. 3 of the Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act, 1869. Now in such a District as Willesden, in any contract for letting for habitation a house or part of a house at a rent not exceeding twenty-six pounds, there shall bo implied a condition that the house is at the commencement of the holding in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. The undertaking is further extended to imply that the house shall during the holding be kept by the landlord in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. If, after viewing the state and condition of any house to which this applies, it appears to the Local Authority that the undertaking is not complied with, the Local Authority shall require the landlord within a reasonable time to execute such works as the Local Authority shall specify to make the house in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. In default of compliance with the notice within the time specified, and unless the landlord has notified the Local Authority that he has closed the house, the Local Authority may do the work required to be done, and recover the expenses incurred as a civil 12 debt. The landlord is safeguarded against arbitrary action by right of appeal to the Local Government Board. This introduces a drastic change in procedure from that followed in similar cases under the Public Health Act, 1875. Non-compliance with notices served under the Public Health Act and Housing of Working Classes Act, 1890 was followed by the issue of a Summons after information duly laid before the Court. At the hearing, if the Magistrates were satisfied with the reasonableness of the requirements of the Local Authority, an order was made upon the owner to execute the work within a time specified, and only in the event of non-compliance with this order could the Local Authority themselves undertake the work and do what was necessary, recovering the costs in due course. The main effect of the Section, therefore, is the substitution of appeal to the Local Government Board for that to the Magistrates. Section 16 extends the power of making byelaws with respect to lodging houses for the working 13 classes. The bye-laws at present in existence are in need of revision. Section 17 amends the procedure for closing orders and demolition orders. Sub-Section 2 provides that “if on the representation of the Medical Officer of Health, or of any other officer of the Authority, or other information given, any dwelling house appears to them to be in such a state it shall be their duty to make an order prohibiting the use of the dwelling house for human habitation (in this Act referred to as a closing order) until in the judgment of the Local Authority the dwelling house is rendered fit for that purpose.” Under the Housing Acts and Public Health Act, 1875, only a Court of Summary Jurisdiction could make a closing order. The increased powers placed in the hands of the Local Authority is a recognition by Parliament that the Local Authority which authorised the application for a closing order was as competent to judge of the advisability of this course as a Magistrate, who 14 might be constrained from granting it by formal legal irregularities which only the ingenuity of smart lawyers could detect. The simplification of the procedure has given a predominence to hygienic over forensic considerations. Section 36, however, would appear to have introduced formal difficulties in respect of powers of entry from which the procedure under the Public Health Act is free. For the exercise of any of the powers of the Housing Acts (including the Act of 1909), it is necessary before entering for the purpose of survey and examination, to give “twenty-four hours' notice to the occupier and to the owner.” No such notice is required under the Public Health Acts. Presumably any action taken under the Housing and Town Planning Act would require to be preceded by formal compliance with this section. “Owner” under the Housing Acts is defined as including “all lessees or mortgagees of any premises required to be dealt with under Pt. II. of the Act, except persons holding or entitled to the rents and 15 profits of such premises for a term of years of which twenty-one years do not remain unexpired." It is obvious that house to house inspection preceded by twenty-four hours' notice to such "owners" cannot proceed with despatch, while the research necessary for the service of such notices will quite preclude its application to systematic house to house inspection. The course which naturally suggests itself is to proceed under the ordinary powers of entry as at present, and in those cases where action under the 1909 Act appears the most suitable, to comply duly with the requirements of the Act, ab initio. The point is one on which you will probably desire to have the opinion of your legal advisers. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, William Buker appendix iv.

A Bye-Law for Regulating the Air-space in connection with the "Back Additions" of houses with the object of securing better Lighting and Ventilation. REPORT — BY — The Medical Officer of Health. London: Morton & Burt, Ltd., Printers, Paddington & Willesden. 1911. A Bye-Law for Regulating the Air-space in oonnection with the "Back Additions" of houses with the object of securing better Lighting and Ventilation. REPORT — by — The Medical Officer of Health. To the Chairman and Members of the Bye-Laws Revision Committee. Gentlemen, In accordance with your instructions, I have the honour to submit the following report on a bye-law relating to the open space to be provided in connection with the back additions of new houses, which has been allowed by the Local Government Board upon the application of the Urban District Council of Barnes In calling the attention of the Public Health Committee to this bye-law, I was influenced by the fact that the bye-laws at present in operation in Willesden fail to prevent the erection of a type of house, becoming increasingly common, which cannot be regarded, from the point of view of healthy housing, as other than most undesirable. The bye-law in question, which has been referred for consideration to the Bye-laws 4 Revision Committee, is as follows:— (i) Every person who shall erect a new domestic building of which any part projects in the rear from the main part of such building shall, in addition to the open space required to be provided in connection with such building by any bye-law in that behalf, provide on one side of such projecting part an open space, exclusively belonging to such building, which shall be free from any erection thereon above the level of the ground, and shall extend laterally throughout the remaining width of such building, and longitudinally throughout the entire length of such projecting part, and he shall cause the distance across the last mentioned open space from the side of such projecting part to the boundary of any lands or premises immediately opposite the side of such new domestic building to be not less in any case than five feet; If the height of such projecting part be not less than fifteen feet or the length not less than twenty feet, but the height be less than twenty-five feet and the length less than twenty-five feet, he shall cause such distance to be seven feet six inches at the least; If the height of such projecting part be not less than twenty-five feet or the length not less than twenty-five feet, but the height be less than thirty-five feet and the length less than thirty-five feet, he shall cause such distance to be ten feet at the least; If the height of such projecting part be not less than thirty-five feet, or the length not less than thirtyfive feet, he shall cause such distance to be twelve feet at the least. *(2) Provided that this bye-law shall not apply in the case of an outbuilding or other building appurtenant to a dwelling-house. "This sub-section appears to be most undesirable. 5 It will be seen that the Barnes bye-law has a twofold object— 1. To prevent the erection of buildings in which the living rooms, through faulty planning of the house, are defectively lighted, and 2. To prevent the erection of buildings in which, owing to faulty planning of the house, certain of the rooms open on to enclosed or partially enclosed spaces in which the air stagnates, with resulting defective ventilation of the rooms communicating with such areas. It is unnecessary to insist on the prime importance to health of securing in dwelling-houses efficient natural lighting and ventilation of the living rooms, and it is only necessary to consider whether the existing bye-laws in Willesden effect this object, and, if not, whether such additions and modifications as are contained in the bye-law under consideration will better secure the objects in view. It is to be noted, in the first place, that the Willesden bye-laws impose no restriction upon the width of air-space extending laterally alongside the back addition, and there is nothing, so far as the Willesden bye-laws are concerned, to prevent this lateral space being reduced to a mere narrow slit. Indeed it is not uncommon to find this space reduced throughout the length of the back addition 6 to four and even three feet; while in many instances it is further encroached upon by lateral projections from the back addition itself, which in some cases completely obstruct the direct vista of the windows opening to the rear of the main building. It may be said, speaking generally, that practically all the newer houses in Willesden conform to one type, namely, a main building with a back addition. There are, of course, "square" and other shaped buildings without back additions (see fig. i), but these are the exception, especially among the newer houses. In some of the older houses the back addition consists only of the domestic offices on the ground floor, a mere series of outbuildings (see fig. 2). Then we find that, in addition to these domestic offices, the kitchen of the ground floor is built out, with the offices beyond the kitchen or vice versa (see fig. 3). Later, as the occupancy of each floor by separate families becomes increasingly the rule, the b'...ck addition grows to two and three storeys (figs. 4 to 6), and soon is added to the kitchen and offices a bedroom with a corridor giving access to the rooms and offices arranged serially from front to back (figs 7 to 11). 7 The problem of meeting the demand for increased accommodation and convenience in houses has been met by the builder, not by increasing the frontage, but by developing and expanding the back addition. This, of course, economises the more costly portion of the site, the frontage; an economy which, in the case of virgin building land, ought to be completely overridden by the paramount considerations of the healthiness and amenities of the houses which lend to such land its enhanced value. The development of the "back addition" has been in the direction of increasing depth and breadth and height. In the more recent houses it has itself become the parent of a lateral projection leading to the formation, partial or complete, of "well holes," on to which the rooms of the main building, and the offices ranged around the well hole, open. (Figs. 7 to 12.) The effect of this is that the merest chink of skylight gets access to the rooms thus shut off from anything approaching an open outlook. Quite apart from aesthetic considerations, the light reflected from brick walls has lost enormously in quality and quantity as compared with that proceeding directly from the sky. It is less intense, less actinic, and is robbed of those qualities which are essential to healthy 8 living. Just as a plant grows sickly and fails to thrive in a dim twilight, so people living their lives in so sunless a simulacre of light become anaemic, pallid and unhealthy. Moreover, the air enclosed within these bricked-in spaces stagnates. Sheltered from the ceaseless movements of the outer air, it is unchanged while all the time it is being vitiated by the house air, the emanations from small and stuffy bedrooms, from kitchens, sculleries and W.C.'s which are ranged round a bricked shaft or slit instead of opening to the free air. The phase of the "back addition" in domestic architecture, it is to be feared, has established itself too firmly in the suburbs to be readily replaced by a more sanitary style of building, but, if it is to continue, something may be done to check the inordinate development of which some of the more recently erected houses afford a "horrid example." The bye-law of the Barnes District Council is a step in the direction of minimising the evils which spring from such defective planning. Under the bye-law, the erection of the lateral projections from the back additions—perhaps the most objectionable feature yet developed—is rendered illegal. It further insists upon a minimum width of 9 5 feet extending laterally along the whole length of the back addition, however short that addition may be. Moreover, the bye-law provides what is an important omission in the Willesden Bye-laws, namely, a ratio between the width of the space immediately at the rear of the main building and the length and height of the back addition. It is clear that this becomes increasingly important as the length and height of back additions tend to increase. The diminishing field of direct light which accompanies the extending length and height of the passages formed by the projections from the rear of the main building calls urgently for regulation. The narrow slits, not infrequently completely occluded by lateral projections, are a more frequent feature in the houses more recently erected and in course of construction, and exemplify a reversion to conditions from which the suburbs of our towns are an attempt at escape. In the Bye-law submitted an attempt is made to rectify the evils arising from this economy of the building site at the cost of hygienic principles in house planning. That its adoption will be compensated in some measure by ingenious, but wrong-headed infringement of other principles 10 in house planning is probable. It is the law of all restrictive impositions. But the desire to fly the evils that we know not of does not absolve from the plain duty of preventing those which are imminent and pressing. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, William Buker January 10th, 1911. appendix v. Millesden Arban District Council. To the Chairman and Members of the Willesden Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report for the year 1910, on the work performed under the Canal Boats Acts, 1877, and 1884, and the Regulations relating to canal boats, issued by the Local Government Board. The canal, consisting of about ¾ of a mile of waterway within the district of Willesden, is situated at Lower Place, the extreme south-west corner of Willesden and about three miles from the administrative centre of the district. The. partial cessation of building operations during the last few years has, in consequence of the fewer number of boats unloading, rendered the work of canal boat inspection very difficult. During the year the work has been further handicapped by the closing of the remaining wharf at Lower Place. At the present time there is no lay-by open for unloading boats in Willesden. This means that every boat inspected has either to be detained, or boarded whilst in motion, the former resented by the occupants, and the latter always attended with risks of immersion. 2 Every opportunity has been taken, when in the neighbourhood of Lower Place, for inspecting the boats. During the year 93 visits were paid to the canal, and 58 boats were inspected, of these nine were found to have contravened the regulations by one or more infringements, the remaining 49 were found structurally to be in good repair and cleanly condition. In one instance overcrowding was established, and a female over the age of 12 years was found to be illegally occupying a cabin. In all instances where contraventions were found to exist notices were at once served upon the offenders and the owners of the boats, and with one exception have all been remedied. This one outstanding case is the subject of correspondence at the present time. No illness of an infectious character was discovered or notified during the year as occurring on the boats. The following table is a summary of the work done, and also shows in detail the contraventions observed during the year:— Total number of visits to canal 93 „ ,, boats inspected 58 ,, ,, ,, contravening Acts and Regulations 9 Total number of infringements 12 ,, ,, ,, remedied 11 3 Infringements and nature of same.

To the Chairman and Members of the School Management and General Purposes Committee. Ladies and Gentlemen, In accordance with your instructions, I have the honour to submit the following Report on the question of providing Spectacles for necessitous children in cases where careful medical examination has shown such provision to be necessary. In the course of medical inspection during 1909 over 40 per cent, of the children examined were found to have defective vision, while seriously defective eyesight was found to be present in about 8 per cent, of the children examined. The defect in practically all the cases can be remedied by wearing proper glasses. Where defective vision is discovered the parents are notified of the fact, and they are recommended to have the refractive error estimated in order that proper glasses may be prescribed. Many of the parents take the trouble to have this done, but those in poorer circumstanoes find it impossible to procure the spectacles which have been prescribed. The cost, which ranges from 2/6 to 7/6, although beyond the compass of many of the parents, is certainly less than that which has been incurred in procuring the prescription, and as this has been provided partly in the initial cost 2 of medical inspection, partly in the equipment of charitable institutions such as Ophthalmic hospitals, and in large measure in the voluntary services of the medical staff of these institutions, it is not only uneconomical, but unfair, that all this effort should be wasted because of the inability of the parent to procure the glasses which are the end and object of the effort. The correspondence submitted herewith shows that the existing charitable organisations fail to meet effectively the difficulty here described. In a Memorandum (Circular 596) issued on 17th August, 1908, by the Board of Education, the Board say:— "Provision of Spectacles, etc.— In cases where medical "inspection shows that the provision of spectacles is necessary "for the treatment of defective eyesight, the Board will be "prepared to consider proposals from a Local Education "Authority to provide suitable and inexpensive spectacles free "of charge. They will, however, only sanction such an "arrangement' if they are satisfied that every endeavour will "first be made to obtain the provision of the spectacles by the "child's parents or by any voluntary associations which exist "for the purpose. The Board will, of course, require that due "precautions should be taken to secure accurate examination "and appropriate prescription by qualified medical men of "suitable experience." Section 1 of the Local Education Authorities (Medical Treat' ment) Act, 1909, provides :— "Where any Local Education Authority provides for the "medical treatment of children attending any public elementary "school under Section 13 of the Education (Administrative "Provisions) Act, 1907, there shall be charged to the parent "of every child in respect of any treatment provided for that "child such an amount not exceeding the cost of treatment as "may be determined by the Local Education Authority, and 3 "in the event of payment not being made by the parent it shall "be the duty of the authority, unless they are satisfied that the "parent is unable by reason of circumstances, other than his "own default, to pay the amount, to require the payment of "that amount from that parent, and any such amount may be "recovered summarily as a civil debt." In compliance with these powers, I venture to submit the following scheme:— 1. That all children discovered upon medical inspection to have seriously defective vision (visual acuity of either eye falling below 6/12 ths) whose parents fail to procure the necessary spectacles, be reported by the Assistant School Medical Officers to the School Medical Officer. 2. That the parents of such children be visited and urged to have remedied a defect so injurious to the child. Cases of wilful neglect to be recommended for prosecution under Section 12 of the Children Act. 3. That where glasses have been prescribed and the parent alleges inability on pecuniary grounds to procure them, the spectacles be provided by the Local Education Authority, and the cost, or portion of the cost, be recovered as and when after investigation seems equitable. 4. That the Attendance Officers be instructed to report to the School Medical Officer as to the suitability in all cases where glasses are so provided of exercising the powers of recovery (where necessary) or of remitting the whole or part of such cost as has been incurred. By referring to my Annual Report for 1909, it will be seen that about 700 children were discovered during that year to have vision so defective as to fall within the provisions of this scheme. 4 Assuming that one-third of the parents of such children were too poor to afford the few shillings necessary to procure glasses— I think an excessive estimate— and the average cost of the glasses to be 5/-, the cost to the Local Education Authority of absolutely free provision in such cases would not exceed £60 per annum, and it is inconceivable that a considerable proportion of this would not be returned or recovered in full or in part payment by the beneficiaries. In fact, the aim should be assisted provision where necessarv rather than free provision. Should the Committee decide to apply to the Board of Education to adopt this scheme, and the Board sanction its adoption, I think tenders for the supply of spectacles should be invited under terms of contract. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Willam Buler School Medical Officer. 24th November, 1910. APPENDIX VII. Millesden urban District Council. PUBLIC HEALTH QUARTERLY STATISTICS.

The population estimates upon which the present ward rates are based are less reliable than the corresponding data relating to the old wards. There is no census datum from which to calculate the new ward populations, and, although in a district like Willesden, with a rapidly growing, and not less rapidly changing population, an interval of nine years from the census seriously militates against the accuracy of the estimate, the census datum nevertheless affords a valuable basis of calculation which is lacking in the figures taken to represent the population of the present wards. Moreover, the age and sex distribution of the population of the wards existing at the census was then ascertained and has been estimated to have retained its character in the respective wards till the close of last year. No such knowledge of the age and sex distribution of the population in the existing wards is available and no data exist on which to base an estimate of this age and sex distribution. It is not possible, therefore, to give the corrections for age and sex distribution, which have hitherto been applied to the death rates of the wards. For the same reason it is not possible to give the incidence rates of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, upon persons under fifteen years of age (the most useful figure for the purpose of comparison of infectious disease incidence). The standard death rates for the new wards cannot be calculated until the next census figures are available. The Infantile Mortality rate which for the quarter is calculated 3 upon a fourth of the infants born during the twelve months immediately preceding, is not given for the wards in this report, as the necessary data are not available. In its place, however, I have shown a rate which represents the rate of Infantile Mortality during the first three months of life, an interesting comparative figure which until the necessary facts are forthcoming will best take the place of the usual Infantile Mortality Rate. The comparative value of the statistical returns presented, therefore, is considerably less than that of the analagous rates in previous reports. The best has been done with the material available, but it should be borne in mind that at the best these rates are merely crude approximations. These remarks of course do not apply to the rates of the district as a whole. 4 BIRTHS for First Quarter, 1910 * WARDS. Total. Boys. Girls. Rate per 1000. Corresponding period last year.

May 4th, 1910. 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, The following figures show the number of patients treated during the first three months of the year. It will be seen that 99 patients were admitted. This is an unusually low figure, and in order to find a correspondingly low admission rate for the same period it is necessary to go back to 1903, when 93 patients were admitted. For the first three months of last year, the number of patients admitted was 282, and from that period onwards there has been a progressive diminution in the number of admissions until the quarter just ended, when, as shown, 99 were admitted. It is unlikely, however, that this low admission rate will be maintained, as the number of patients usually increases as the year progresses. QUARTERLY STATISTICS. Disease.

October 8th, 1910. 11 HOSPITAL STATISTICS. To the Hospital Visiting Committee. Gentlemen, I submit the figures dealing with the number of patients treated during the quarter just ended. Disease. Remaining in Hospital, June 30,1910. Admitted. Discharged. Died. Remaining in Hospital, Sept. 30,1910. Scarlet Fever 20 66 41 0 45 Diphtheria 14 50 44 2 18 Enteric Fever 0 3 2 0 1 Other Diseases 2 18 15 1 4 Total 36 137 102 3 68 For the corresponding period last year the number of patients admitted was 165, and 75 patients remained under treatment on the expiration of the Quarter. It would seem, therefore, that the work of the coming winter will be much the same as last year and not of the excessive nature experienced in previous years. All the Wards have been washed down and disinfected during the summer and rendered in every way thoroughly fit for use. For the Quarter the maintenance of patients has cost 4/8¼, and of Staff, 8/11¼ per week. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, W. J. J. STEWART. October 11th, 1910.
