(Appointed 14.1.63). 4 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Erith Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1963, my eighteenth and probably the last to be submitted to the Authority as at present constituted in view of the creation of the London Borough of Bexley under the London Government Act, 1963. Eighteen years is not a long time in the life of a local authority (although it does represent a substantial slice of the working life of an individual) but it is long enough to warrant a comparison of the health circumstances of the Borough at the beginning and end of this period. The year 1946 witnessed the beginning of the transition from war to peace. The strain of bombardment of the civilian population was lifted and the re-integration of family life was assisted by the return of evacuated children and by an acceleration of the rate of demobilisation of the Armed Forces. Housing circumstances had been seriously affected by bombing and the suspension of new building, and represented the most serious of the problems facing the Borough at that time. Difficulties in the process of resettlement in civilian life inevitably occurred as a result of the enforced separation, over a number of years, of husbands and wives, children and parents; food shortages remained and in many ways the discipline of the wartime years continued. Strangely enough, in spite of these vicissitudes the general health of the community, as evidenced by the vital statistics of the area remained good. The infant mortality rate (i.e. the number of children dying in the first year of life per 1,000 live births), a very sensitive index of social conditions, was 32.3 per 1,000 live births in 1946, a ven favourable rate compared with previous years. At the outbreak of the war the rate was 44.28 per 1,000. This rate has continued to fall and in 1963, was 17.2 per 1,000 and, even allowing for the fluctuations which are expected when dealing with small numbers, it may be said with some justification that there has been a downward trend since the end of the war which is statistically significant. This has. undoubtedly, been due to improved environmental conditions including housing, an advance in child health services 5 including health education and the discovery of the chemotherapeutic drugs as well as penicillin and the other antibiotics which have greatly simplified the control of the childhood infections. The maternal mortality rate (the number of deaths of mothers in childbirth per 1,000 total births) had shown a similar decline. The rate in 1921 was 4.0 per 1,000 live and still births and in 1944 the rate was 2.2 per thousand. It is pleasant to record that there have been no maternal deaths due to childbirth, in the Borough, for the past five years, This improvement can be related to improved obstetric services, better housing conditions and, again, better chemical and antibiotic control of the puerperal infections. The birth rate in 1946 was 22.30 per 1,000 of the population (19.13 and 24.3 in the previous two years) and fell steadily until about 1955 when an upward trend became noticeable. The rate for 1963 was 17.91 compared with 13.51 per 1,000 in 1954. The Department for Education and Sciences publication "Statistics of Education", 1963 (H.M.S.O.) show that the post-war "bulge" now passing out of the secondary schools is but the forerunner of bigger bulges to come which are bound to have important social, industrial and educational implications for the future. The death rate, on the other hand, has remained almost unchanged over the past 18 years and more. The fall in the death rate in the country as a whole began around 1875 and was due to improvements in the adverse environmental conditions which the process of urbanisation had brought to bear on the community— not merely in regard to sanitation but housing, overcrowding, nutrition, hours of work and factory conditions. The tuberculosis death rate also began to fall about the same time and has continued unabated jo the present day. Improved standards of living and medical discoveries have combined to bring this about and to raise the general expectation of life of the population. Why then has the death rate not continued to fall ? The answer is twofold. Firstly with an ageing population more People may be expected to die for there is a limit to which life can be prolonged and, secondly, deaths from certain causes have increased over the past quarter of a century, notably, cancer of the lung, cardio-vascular disease, including coronary disease and accidents both on the roads and in the home. The causes of these epidemics, for this is what they really are, are so complex and interwoven in the fabric of our Society that there can be no easy way to their 6 vention. The highly competitive nature of life today, the pursuit of ever-increasing standards of living, automation, and the advances of science and technology, good in many respects, unfortunately bring with them new hazards to human health and happiness, e.g. radio-active contamination, atmospheric pollution, noise, sophistication of our food supplies, speed and a materialistic outlook which is not conducive to the mental health of the population. In 1950, the first year in which separate figures became available for cancer of the lung, the number of deaths from this cause was 16 compared with 26 in 1962 and 32 in 1963. The number of deaths ascribed to coronary disease similarly rose from 37 in 1950 to 105 in 1962 and 101 in 1963. During the period 28th October to 1st November, 1963, a Smoking and Health Campaign was held in conjunction with Bexley and Erith. The spearhead of this was a five day visit to the area of the Central Council for Health Education mobile unit which visited a number of secondary schools and a Youth organisation. Films were shown at those schools not actually visited by the Unit. Ten thousand copies of a personal letter addressed to parents by the Medical Officer of Health were distributed thoughout the schools and a large number of leaflets and posters were made available in the area. The Campaign made a good impact on the public at the time but I fear that it will take much more than this to shake the public generally out of their apathy in regard to this problem. Section 32 of the Children and Young Persons Act, 1963 substantially increases the penalty for the sale of tobacco to persons under 16 years of age but it would appear that the problem of enforcement will remain. The picture is much brighter in regard to the older epidemic's. In 1946 five cases of diphtheria were notified in the Borough (22 cases with one death in 1940, 35 cases with 3 deaths in 1931). There has not been a single notified case of diphtheria in the Borough for the past 14 years. In the late summer of 1947, suddenly and unaccountably, poliomyelitis struck the country after many years ot relative quiescence. Six cases occurred in the Borough with one death. Immunisation against this disease began in 1956 and it is significant that, since that time, there has been a remarkable decline in poliomyelitis. The number of cases in Erith in the six years period 1958 to 1963 was one compared with 28 the previous six years. Few would deny that this decrease is closely related to the immunisation of children and young adults in the Borough first by the Salk vaccine and now by the oral vaccine which has almost replaced the former. 7 Over the relatively short period under review there has been a marked improvement in food hygiene in the Borough as a result of the implementation of the Food Hygiene Regulations and of internal developments of the Catering trades as a whole. Refrigeration of foodstuffs is, now, almost universal and the wrapping of foodstuffs has gone to considerable lengths. The opportunities for the occurrence of food poisoning are certainly fewer nowadays (there was one notified case in 1963) but constant vigilance is still necessary as human sources of error can still defeat the most elaborate equipment. A further hazard arises from the growing tendency for people to take their holidays abroad and the importation of typhoid fever appears to be a growing risk. In regard to housing the Council have pursued a steady slum clearance programme both by clearance orders and by the demolition of individual unfit houses. Amongst their most notable achievements during this period, has been the clearance of the old houses from the Victoria Road area and the University Place area, and their replacement by modern housing estates. The Borough now has no slums in the accepted sense of the word but there are still quite a number of individual houses which will need to be dealt with in the next five years. The obsolescence factor is, indeed, low and, with the increase in the number of owner-occupiers and the provision of new houses by the Council and private enterprise and the improvement of some of the older houses by improvement grant procedure this favourable position could be maintained. The housing needs of the elderly and of young families living in cramped conditions either in furnished accommodation or with "in-laws" present an urgent problem throughout the country and are recognised by the Council as a major obstacle to health and happiness which should be removed as soon as possible. The Belvedere Marsh encampment, which at one census housed 971 persons in caravans, tents and miscellaneous structures, since about the beginning of the century, has been subject to Compulsory Purchase by the Council. Whilst conditions were at all times grossly unsatisfactory, the river flood which occurred on 31st January, 1953, produced indescribable conditions of destruction which necessitated a declaration of Unfitness on 20th February, 1953. This resulted in the rehousing of private occupiers and Persons engaged in business, to prefabricated dwellings Provided by the Council in Jenningtree Way. . By January 1954, the acreage of marshland so used was ultimately cleared of all moveable and permanent structures 8 and this ended one of the most pressing housing problems ever faced by a local authority. Atmospheric pollution is nowadays the most important hazard to the health of the community. It is comparable in its magnitude to the pollution of public water supplies in the 19th century before the provision of water-carriage sewerage schemes and, the problems involved in its abolition are probably even more complex. The atmosphere is becoming, more and more, a new kind of public sewer into which every kind of gaseous filth is discharged— from the domestic fire, the factory chimney and of course the ever growing number of motor vehicles, both diesel and petrol, which threaten to bring chaos to our roads. The Clean Air Act of 1956 has enabled local authorities to take the first step to control black smoke emissions from the domestic hearth and factory and much has already been achieved in some of the worst "black areas" of the country. Despite its many shortcomings the Act remains one of the most important and far-reaching pieces of legislation on the Statute Book and the many frustrations arising from its operation should be seen as the teething troubles inherent in such a great task as the removal of one of the main causes of chronic bronchitis, one of the great killing diseases, and of cancer of the lung, of which it is no doubt a contributory cause. The Child Welfare Services were transferred to the Kent County Council in 1948 under the National Health Service Act, 1946. Now, the wheel has turned full circle and, as a result of the London Government Act, 1963 the new London Borough of Bexley will, on 1st April, 1965 become responsible for the Health and Welfare and Children's services. It is difficult not to feel some regret at the passing of the old order but one cannot but welcome the great opportunities and challenge which face the new Borough and which will, surely, in years to come, bring about a fully integrated Health service, close to the people it is designed to serve and providing opportunities for the prevention of disease and the promotion of health greater than ever before particularly in the field of mental health and the welfare of the elderly and the handicapped. During 1963 Mr. L. E. King, Chief Public Health Inspector retired after 25 years service in this capacity with the Erith Borough Council. I wish to place on record my appreciation of the help and support which I received from him during his long and distinguished term of office. 9 In conclusion I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement and the Chief Public Health Inspector, Chief Clerk and all members of the Health Department for the good work which has been done during the year. I am, Your obedient servant, JOHN LANDON Medical Officer of Health. 10 Annual Report 1963 SECTION A:— STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA A (1) Physical Situation and Amenities Erith is situated in the north-west corner of Kent and is bounded on the north-east by the River Thames to which it has a frontage of about four miles: on the west by the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich and the Borough of Bexley, and on the south by the Borough of Bexley and the Urban District of Crayford. In spite of continuous industrial expansion, the Borough still retains in many places a rural aspect, and views from the many vantage points in the district afford evidence of its undulating nature and the tree endowed areas of Belvedere and Abbey Wood. The shopping centres are advantageously situated having regard to the disposition of the six wards in the Borough and there is a copious supply of pure water which is provided and maintained by the Metropolitan Water Board. The chief industries are light engineering, edible oil refining, manufacture of chemicals, coal shipping and lighterage, and the production of building materials, i.e., stoneware drain pipes and asbestos components. The manufacture of television and radio equipment and toys are also well established industries. As in other years, industrial expansion has continued. 11 A (2) Comparative Rainfall 1963 1962 Month Inches Month inches January 0.77 January 2.47 February 0.57 February .57 March 2.70 March 1.44 April 1.99 April 1.70 May 1.69 May 1.86 June 2.02 June .38 July 1.29 July 2.40 August 2.16 August 1.61 September 2.15 September 2.26 October 1.22 October 1.13 November 3.25 November 2.05 December 0.39 December 2.46 Total in inches 20.20 Total in inches 20.33 A (3) Unemployment Figures and Comments With the co-operation of Mrs. J. A. Walker, the Manager of Erith Employment Exchange, it is once again possible to give definite figures with regard to the state of unemployment in the district, as shown in the table. I am indebted to Mrs. J. A. Walker for the following report:— At the beginning of 1963 there was a sharp rise in unemployment, due to the appalling weather conditions, but this did not last and there was a steady fall throughout the year and the figure for 1963 was lower than at the end of 1962. The number of unemployed women, however, did not vary appreciably from month to month. I am indebted to Miss E. Martin, Youth Employment Officer, for the following report:— Although figures showing unemployment among boys and girls were fairly high in January (50 boys, including 22 school leavers, and 33 girls, including 17 school leavers) there was a steady decrease in numbers during the year. The figures for December show 6 boys and 13 girls unemployed. At the beginning of the year difficulty was experienced in placing Christmas school leavers and one boy and two girls had still not been placed by the middle of March. This position had improved by the end of the Easter Term and all Easter school leavers had been found work before the end of May— most of them having started work before the end of April. This position was repeated at the end of the Summer Term, all Summer leavers having entered emPloyment before the end of September. 12 Erith and District Unemployment Figures 1943-1963 Mouth and Year Males Females Total 18 and over Under 18 18 and over Under 18 December, 1943 27 1 6 5 39 December, 1944 31 — 6 3 40 December, 1945 91 1 133 1 226 December, 1946 177 12 58 13 260 December, 1947 131 4 94 5 234 December, 1948 208 7 129 2 346 December, 1949 111 8 153 3 275 December, 1950 114 3 122 1 240 December, 1951 82 1 103 3 189 December, 1952 134 1 82 2 219 December, 1953 101 6 91 9 207 December, 1954 52 3 74 10 139 December, 1955 38 — 43 — 81 December, 1956 53 — 41 — 94 December, 1957 113 7 52 6 178 December, 1958 222 12 120 3 357 December, 1959 152 4 72 1 229 December, 1960 125 4 60 1 190 December, 1961 96 5 46 5 152 December, 1962 233 20 8 11 262 December, 1963 186 6 13 13 218 A (4) STATISTICS A (4)a General Area (i) Including River:— 4.607 acres.

D (1) Refuse Collection and Disposal The method of storage is by means of sanitary dustbins and some 19,600 are emptied weekly. The dustbins are provided and maintained by the owners of the properties concerned, the Council securing this by a local Act— The Erith Improvement Act 1920. The refuse is transported to a Transfer Depot where it is transferred into Contractors' bulk container vehicles, and disposal is effected by tipping at Stone. In October a special vehicle was purchased for the collection of refuse from multiple flats— a Shelvoke & Drewry 18 cu. yds. Freighter, two way Tipper. D (l)a Costs £ s. d.

Sewage is disposed of at the outfall works of the West Kent Main Sewerage Board. 14 domestic cesspools are known to exist and these are emptied, when required, by a special vehicle and the contents emptied into the Council's sewer. During the year the use of one cesspool was discontinued 33 D (5)e Atmospheric Pollution With the large number of industrial premises involved, considerable time has had to be devoted to atmospheric pollution problems and co-operation has been maintained with factory management and where necessary, with the Alkali Inspector and the Factory Inspectorate. The Erith Borough Council is represented on the Thames-side Advisory Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution and in this connection a monthly deposit gauge, a lead peroxide gauge and a volumetric apparatus are maintained for the collection of the necessary data. (A) The monthly results of analysis for the deposit gauge and lead peroxide gauge are as follows:— Month Deposit gauge Lead peroxide gauge Sulphur mg/100 sq. cms/day Rain in inches Insoluble deposit Tons per sq. mile Soluble deposit Tons per sq mile Total Solids Tons per sq mile Calcium Tons per sq. mile January 1.26 6.27 15.84 22.11 3.28 3.53 February 0.65 33.60 10.87 44.47 2.34 2.47 March 2.19 10.57 8.99 19.56 1.49 1.31 April 1.93 7.78 7.38 15.16 1.31 1.20 May 1.71 7.03 4.26 11.29 0.55 1.11 June 2.33 9.79 8.12 17.91 1.21 0.59 July 1.38 8.80 6.81 15.61 1.30 0.59 August 2.82 5.42 6.31 11.73 0.91 0.51 September 2.00 5.22 8.99 14.21 1.69 0.87 October 1.51 5.50 6.85 12.34 1.32 1.13 November 3.33 2.99 6.71 9.70 0.97 1.03 December 0.48 8.45 8.12 16.57 1.91 2.01 Monthly Average 17.56 1.52 1.36 Monthly average for 1962 15.68 1.30 1.63 The volumetric apparatus is read each day in order to obtain figures for smoke and sulphur dioxide concentrations. A large proportion of the increase which occurs during the winter months is regarded as arising from domestic premises. The comparison of the highest readings this year with the highest readings of 1962, expressed as microgrammes per cubic metre of air, is as follows:— Smoke Sulphur dioxide 26th January, 1963 1049 1742 5th December, 1962 1264 2511 Whereas formerly it was possible to plead, in defence of Proceedings relating, to the emission of dark smoke from factory premises, that the contravention was due to the inability to remedy faulty buildings or equipment, it has since 5th July, 1963, no longer been possible to do so. 34 D (5)f Clean Air Act 1956 Borough of Erith (No. 1) Smoke Control Order 1961 The above. Order, which covers 390 acres, in which there are 3,234 dwellings, was confirmed on the 18th April, 1962, and during 1962 several conversions had been carried out. In the course of 1963 further information was sent out to the majority of householders affected by the Order, and by the end of the year 648 applications to carry out works of conversion or adaptation of fireplaces had been received and many premises had had work carried out to comply with the Order. There remains a great deal of work to do before this Order becomes operative on the 1st October, 1964. Although the present Order is based on the conversion of fires to improved inset open fires, the publication of the Government White Paper on Domestic Fuel Supplies and Clean Air Policy and the Circular 69/63 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government indicate that due to technological changes in the Gas Industry it may not be possible to ensure that adequate supplies of gas coke are available for future Smoke Control areas and such areas may need to be based on heating systems other than inset open fires. D (5)g Swimming Baths and Pools (1) The Council's open air bath is situated in Stonewood Road, and comprises one pool of 57,000 gallons capacity which now is exclusively used by the Kent Education Committee during normal school hours and local youth clubs during the evenings and on Saturdays. Water in the pool, which originates from a well 40 feet deep, is heated to a reasonable temperature by low pressure steam heating and is sterilised by the chlorine process. There is a slipperbath establishment with accommodation for 16 males and 4 females. Adjacent to the bath is a mechanical laundry which launders on behalf of the various undertakings in the locality and which includes the Corporation Catering Dept., the Works Dept., the County Health and Education Depts., and the Royal Alfred Seaman's Home. Due to the severe winter conditions experienced, it was necessary to close the slipper baths to the public from 14th January to 17th April, 1963. During this period workwas intensified on the changeover from coke fired boilers to two Cradley "Steampacket" Oilfired Burners, which were in operation when the baths re-opened on the 17th April, 1963. 35 During the year, 66.665 articles were laundered.

(2) A childrens' paddling pool of 60,000 gallons capacity is situated within the Belvedere recreation ground at Woolwich Road, and which, as in previous years proved to be a popular rendezvous during the summer months in which season a successful model power boat regatta is sponsored by the Welling & District Model Engineers Society. The pool is regularly emptied and cleansed during the period it is in use, and methodically dosed with chloros. D (5)h Offensive Trades Other than 11 fish frying establishments, there are no other scheduled offensive trades under Section 107 of the Public Health Act 1936 in the Borough. Fish frying was declared to be an offensive trade on 17th March 1939, and bye-laws were made accordingly. All the fish frying businesses are well conducted and the frying apparatus at each is of modern and approved pattern. D (5)i Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act 1951 There are two registered premises in the Borough in which filling materials as defined in the Act are used. The Act is designed to secure that clean filling materials are used in the upholstery trade, and applies to manufacturers' and dealers' premises alike. The persons operating businesses are dealers, and in addition to regular inspections ®ade at their premises, a sample of new cotton felt was 36 obtained and submitted to the Prescribed Analyst for the purpose of testing. The sample was reported as satisfactory, having regard to the trash content, oil content and dust index. D (5)j Pet Animals Act 1951 There are 4 pet animals shops in the Borough at which a wide variety of domestic pets can be purchased. All the premises were regularly visited and found to be well conducted, and no conditions contrary to the welfare provisions of the above Act have been observed. D (5)k Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 Under Section 3 of the above Act, there is only one conditionally licensed site existing in the Borough. The site in question consists of one half acre of land on which three caravans are stationed. During the year it was found necessary to give attention to various sites in order that unauthorised caravanners did not become established. D (5)1 Hop pickers There are no hop fields in the district. D (5)m Rodent control Two fully trained operatives are employed to deal with rodent infestations at commercial, private and Corporation premises. The numbers of premises inspected and treated during the year are as follows Inspected Treated Commercial premises 314 30 Dwellings 733 50 As in other years, Corporation sewers were disinfested during the year when manholes were successfully treated with baits consisting of oatmeal, sugar, oil, warfarin, and added preservative. The Prevention of Damage by Pests (application to Shipping) Order, 1951, applies to the many wharfs, jetties and dry slipways in the Borough, and was implemented by the following visits and inspections being made:— Commercial barges 17 Coastwise vessels 4 Tugs 4 Oil tankers Miscellaneous craft No marine infestations were located during the year. 37 D (5)n Pest control, etc. For many years, the Department has operated a private works scheme with considerable success as a result of which matters which are outside the scope of the statutory provisions of the Public Health Act can be dealt with promptly. This practical assistance of the Department's outdoor service is available to all residents who need such help, in particular having regard to choked waste pipes, soilpipes and drainsand the destruction of ants and wasps nests. The income from the above service amounted to £21 10s. 6d. D (5)o Eradication of Bed Bugs The number of dwellings treated during the year is as follows:— Privately owned houses 3 Corporation houses 5 Occupiers are encouraged to reveal promptly any signs of infestation so that the menace can be eradicated in its initial stages. D (5)p Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act 1952 and Regulations 1953 For the purpose of ensuring that gas, electric and oil appliances on sale complied with the above statute, the probe test was applied to many appliances in shops, all of which were found to be satisfactory. D (5)q Consumer Protection Act 1961 The Oil Heaters Regulations 1962 The above Regulations impose requirements in relation to domestic space heaters which burn paraffin oil and are not designed for use with a flue. Such appliances must now have warning notices attached at the time of sale, and Provision is made for appliances to be purchased by the Local Authority under Paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the J-onsumer Protection Act 1961 with a view to performance eing tested by any body authorised by the Secretary of State. D (5)r Mosquito Control Various breeding grounds, including ditches on the Belvedere Marshes, have been treated with insecticide with a Vlew to controlling mosquito breeding. 38 D (5)s Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956 No action was necessary at any premises in the Borough with regard to the above Act. D (5)t Agriculture Act 1947 Complaints were received from residents that foxes were again active in the Borough and that poultry and pets had been killed. The incidence of foxes in urban areas is not uncommon and arrangements exist whereby complaints are investigated in co-operation with the Pest Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who undertakes the necessary control measures. D (5)u Common Lodging Houses There are no registered Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. D (6) Shops Act 1950 The following Closing Orders are in operation in the area:— Closing hour (1) Erith Weekly Half Holiday (No. 1) Order dated 17th February, 1913 1 p.m. Thursday (2) Erith Hairdressers & Barbers Shops Closing Order dated 11th March, 7 p.m. every 1947 evening No partial exemption Orders with regard to Sunday trading provided for by Section 48 of the Shops Act 1950 exist. A request by a National Association for the Council partly to rescind the Shops Act Closing Order affecting the Early Closing Day, so that the way was clear for the future introduction of five day opening for shops was deferred, as the forthcoming amalgamation of Erith and the adjoining local authorities to form London Borough 18 would indicate a complete review of the present Shops Closing Orders. No legal proceedings were instituted during the yean but on three occasions it was found necessary to draw the attention of shopkeepers to statutory provisions regarding Sunday trading. Attention has been given to the facilities required under Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950, and improvements were effected as indicated at the time of inspection. 39 D (7) Sanitary Accommodation at Offices In accordance with the requirements of section 46 of the Public Health Act, 1936, all new offices constructed were provided with suitable and sufficient sanitary accommodation. Many improvements were effected at existing premises and close liaison exists with the Planning Section of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department. D (8) Street Trading There is no regular street trading in the Borough apart from an occasional fruit stall. Several mobile ice cream vans and a small number of greengrocery and similar trading vehicles operate in the area. D (9) Flooding No flooding incidents occurred during the year. D (10) Council Refuse Tip Regular visits and inspections have been made at the Refuse transit depot in Manor Road, and the necessary action taken with a view to keeping the premises free from vermin. D (11) Noise Abatement Act 1960 The reaction of people to noise varies considerably. No serious complaints have been reported during the year but on a few occasions co-operation with factory management and shop keepers has generally proved effective when dealing with local complaints. 40 D (12) Factories Act 1961 Part 1 of the Act (1) Inspections for purposes of provisions as to health (including inspections made by Public Health Inspectors).

One application referred to premises where previously a Certificate of Disrepair had been applied for but not issued as an undertaking had been given, and four referred to premises where an undertaking had been given by the owner direct to the tenant. On two occasions it was necessary for additional work to be carried out before the Certificates would be issued. No appeals, either by landlords or by tenants, against Local Authority decisions were made to the County Court during the year. The majority of enquiries made with regard to this Act are from tenants desirous of effecting rent reductions because of items of disrepair, but considerable assistance has been given to those seeking information on matters concerning de-control, notice to quit, and tenancy agreements. Having regard to the circumstances, each case is dealt with on its merits. 45 SECTION E—WATER SUPPLY—MILK—FOOD AND DRUGS ACT—FOOD INSPECTION E (1) Water supply The Borough is served throughout by the Metropolitan Water Board, the water containing some 30.8 degrees of hardness. Without known exception, the supply is led direct into the premises served. Twenty samples drawn from various points in the district have been forwarded to the Public Health Laboratory for bacteriological examination, with satisfactory results. E (2)a Milk, (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 (a) The designations applicable to milk sold in the Borough are' Pasteurised,' 'Sterilised ' and 'Tuberculin Tested." Pasteurised milk must be bottled at the premises at which it is heat treated. There are no pasteurising plants and bottling establishments within the Borough. (b) Details of dealers licences to use a special designation in relation to milk which is obtained and sold pre-packed by the dealer are as follows:— Pasteurised 27 Sterilised 16 Tuberculin tested 24 Total 67 (c) The following samples of designated milk from various sources and retailed in the Borough were obtained and submitted for examination:— Pasteurised 12 Sterilised 5 Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 2 Total 19 All satisfied the prescribed tests. 46 E (2)b Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 Number of registered distributors in Borough 12 Number of dairies 3 Number of milkshops 39 Number of producer/retailers 0 Regular inspections have been made at the above throughout the year. E (2)c Ice-Cream 130 premises in the Borough are registered for the sale of ice cream. The majority deal in prepared products produced by the large manufacturers. Two premises are used for the manufacture of ice cream by the heat treatment method. Three samples of ice cream and one sample of ice cream mix were submitted to the Public Analyst and reported as satisfactory. Nine samples were forwarded to the Public Health Laboratory for bacteriological examination and graded satisfactory as follows:— Grade 1 6 Grade 2 3 E (3) Meat and Food Inspection E (3)a Slaughterhouses There is one privately owned slaughterhouse in the Borough in which slaughtering takes place every day of the week except Friday. In order to effect 100% inspection of carcases and offals, it has been necessary for a Public Health Inspector to be in attendance during the whole of the normal day and in the evenings of usually three days a week, and every Saturday and Sunday. At times of greater throughput it has been necessary to have two Inspectors on duty. With the coming into force of the Meat Inspection Regulations, 1963, on the 1st October, 1963, it was necessary to have two Public Health Inspectors regularly in attendance at the slaughterhouse, in order to carry out the form of inspection made compulsory by the Regulations, and the marking of all carcases passed as fit for human consumption. 47 Because of the resulting disruption of other duties, an additional District Public Health Inspector was appointed to commence duties early in 1964. Until legislation makes provision for regulating the hours of slaughter, it would appear that the present exacting situation with which the department has to cope is likely to continue. The Meat Inspection Regulations, 1963, give power to the Local Authority to make charges for meat inspection and the Council have adopted the maximum charges permitted, i.e. 2/6d. per horse or bovine animal, other than a calf. 9d. per calf or pig. 6d. per sheep, lamb or goat. 48 The following table in prescribed form details the number of carcases inspected and condemned:— Carcases and offal inspected and condemned in whole or in part. Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses Number killed 2622 5689 411 8830 30621 - Number inspected 2622 5689 411 8830 30621 - All diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci.

During the normal course of meat inspection by the Public Health Inspectors at the Belvedere slaughterhouse, lesions of tuberculosis were found in five bovine carcases as a result of which the Animal Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at Maidstone was notified and veterinary officers were enabled to identify the animals concerned, trace back to the herd of origin and impose restrictions on that herd, including the carrying out of tuberculin tests. E (3)c Other Foods Much time and attention has been devoted to the inspection of food in shops and stores as a result of which a total of 7 tons, 16 cwts., 0 qtrs., 10 lbs., was found to be unfit for human consumption and surrendered for removal and destruction. E (3)d Disposal of Unsound Meal and other Food As there are no sterilising facilities for unfit meat at the Belvedere slaughterhouse, such meat is stained with naphthaline green and transported by arrangement for sterilisation elsewhere. All unsound food, exclusive of the above is disposed of by tipping with the town's refuse. E (3)e Slaughter o? Animals Act, 1958 Humane slaughtering of all animals in accordance with the above prevails in the Borough. The instruments used are the captive bolt pistol and the electrolethaler. The number of slaughtermen's licences operative is 11. 50 E(4) Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Sections 2 and 91. The following samples of food were procured during the year and submitted to the Public Analyst for the purpose of analysis with the results as follows:— Article No. of Samples Satisfactory Unsatisfactor Milk 11 11 - Ice-cream 3 3 - Ice-cream mixes 1 1 - Ground almonds 1 1 - Almond marzipan 2 1 1 Cream 2 2 — Mashed potato 1 1 — Filled bread roll 1 - 1 Bread mixture 1 1 - Bread sauce 1 1 - Milk shakes 2 2 - Tinned cream soups 2 2 - Tinned soups 5 5 - Milk puddings 6 6 - Fish cakes 1 1 - Ground nutmeg I 1 - Sauces and dressings 10 10 - Colourings & flavourings 7 7 - Corned Beef 1 1 - Coffee 2 2 - Soft drinks 4 3 1 Cake, etc., mixtures 5 5 - Cashew kernals 1 1 - Ground nut oil 1 1 - Meat puddings, etc. 6 5 1 Fats 3 3 — Miscellaneous meat dishes 5 5 — Cheese spread 2 2 — Sugar and glucose 2 2 — Dressed crab 1 1 — Christmas pudding 2 2 — Cascara tablets 1 1 — Tinned fruit & vegetables 5 5 — Condiments 4 4 — Mixed fruit 1 1 - Cut mixed peel 1 1 - Flour 1 1 — Baking powder 1 1 - Red currant jelly 1 1 - Total 108 104 4 With regard to the four unsatisfactory samples, the following action was taken:— Almond Marzipan: No further stocks were available for the taking of a formal sample. 51 Filled Bread Roll: Representation was made to the management of the factory canteen concerned. Soft Drink: A cautionary letter was sent to the manufacturer regarding a slight phenolic odour. Meat Pudding: Slightly below the recommended meat content. Information is being obtained on this matter pending the making of a Standard for meat puddings and similar products. E(5) Food Hygiene. The Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960. Almost without exception, the sale of food is limited to shop premises, and neither street trading nor mobile vehicle trading seems to have any attraction for the average food purchaser in the Borough of Erith. During the year considerable improvements have been carried out at foodshops, and having regard to the availability of ample food supplies it is apparent that the majority of trade.rs are most conscious of a discriminating purchasing public, and this in itself considerably aids an all-round improvement in the display of foodstuffs in an endeavour to attract the hygienic minded purchasers. All the 34 public houses in the Borough have been inspected as a result of which many sanitary and other improvements have been carried out, and where necessary, recommendations have been made with a view to improving food service. Liaison exists with the Licensing Justices concerning the transfer of Licences. Number of registered food premises in Borough, (a) Registered under Food & Drugs Act, 1955. No. of premises.
