459(1) ACT 60 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 195 7 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1957 2 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1957 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. I submit the Annual Report of the health of the Borough of Acton for 1957. During the year there were 919 cases of measles. Some serious sequelae occurred chiefly in children under school age. There were 12 cases of poliomyelitis and during this year the limited scheme for polio-vaccination was extended; 1884 children completed a course with 2,034 awaiting the arrival of Salk vaccine. I append below a table showing the deaths that have occurred due to cancer of the lung or bronchus. The greatest number of deaths, as one has recently been led to expect, were due to cancer of the bronchus in the male population of the 45.65 age group. 3 DEATHS FROM CANCER OF THE LUNG AND BRONCHUS— 1952 to 1957 Year Total 25—45 45—65 65 + Bronchus Lung Bronchus Lung Bronchus Lung M.

Consequently it is not strictly possible to compare the birth and death rates for Acton with those for England and Wales. 12 SECTION B GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA LABORATORY FACILITIES These continue as in previous years. The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service provides a Pathological Service at the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens submitted for examination. Type No. of specimens examined Throat and Nose Swabs 60 Sputum 30 Faeces 336 Hair, Widals, etc. 19 Milk 112 Milk Bottles 21 Water 66 Ice-Cream 229 Miscellaneous Foods 3 HOSPITAL PROVISION The Regional Hospital Board of the N.W. Metropolitan Area, which includes Acton, is responsible for hospital treatment of the sick. The most difficult cases for which to obtain treatment are old persons or chronic sick who become acutely ill or who are in the terminal stage of their illness. These types of cases need continuous care and treatment, and it is just these requirements which cannot be met in the home. 13 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Under Section 47 of this Act power is given to the Councils of County Boroughs and County Districts to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for removal and detention, in a suitable hospital or other place, of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions; and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. Application is made to the Court only as a last resort, and in several cases which came to my notice during the year it was possible, either to persuade the persons concerned to enter a hospital or home voluntarily, or to provide home help, nursing and other local services so that they could remain in their own homes. However, in one case it was found necessary to take action under Section 47. This case concerned a woman aged 90 years who was senile and had a high blood pressure condition. Her relatives refused to help in any way and it became increasingly difficult to get Home Helps to attend her due to her bad habits, behaviour and abusiveness. As she was not receiving the care and attention she needed I decided that it would be in the woman's interest if she was removed to hospital. An order was obtained authorising her detention for three months and this period was extended as her physical condition did not improve. She was still in hospital at the end of the year. Under Section 50 of this Act the Borough Council arranged for the burial of 6 persons where no other provision was being made. PUBLIC HEALTH LAUNDRY SERVICE The Public Health Laundry Service was commenced in November 1955 under the powers of Section 84 of the Public Health Act 1936, to assist incontinent old persons and to relieve them or their relatives of the burden of washing soiled linen. The service is running smoothly and the number of cases dealt with weekly continue to fluctuate between 10 and 15. There is no doubt that a service of this kind is of great value to the community. Commercial launderies will not accept articles 14 in the condition dealt with under the Council scheme, and the relief is greatly welcomed by patients and relatives. It is certain that in some cases relatives would be unable to cope with these incontinent old people and removal to hospital would be necessary. I give below details of the cases dealt with during 1957. Number of cases dealt with 44 Number of cases died 11 Number of cases removed to hospital 15 Number of cases where other arrangements made 1 Number of collections 737 SECTION C HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL AMBULANCE FACILITIES The Middlesex County Council is responsible for this service. NURSING IN THE HOME This service is administered locally by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care in Acton during the year was 937 necessitating 34,246 visits. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE In October the five weekly Child Welfare sessions at Avenue Road were reduced to four by reason of the shortage of Health Visiting staff and the two ante-natal sessions at this clinic were also compressed into a single weekly session. CHILD WELFARE CLINICS The average attendances per session for the five Child Welfare Clinics are given below, last year's figures being shown in brackets. Avenue Road 4 sessions weekly 26.3 (23.6) Trinity Way 2 sessions weekly 34.3 (38.3) Cloister Road 2 sessions weekly 26.6 (27.5) Steele Road 2 sessions weekly 26.3 (27.4) Pierrepoint Road 3 sessions weekly 32.9 (32.5) 15 Total number of children who first attended the clinics during the year, and who, on the date of their first attendance were: — Under one year of age 890 Between the ages of one and five 80 Total number of children who attended during the year, and who, at the end of the year were: — Under one year of age 821 Over one year 1,886 Total number of attendances at Clinics during the year: — By children under one year of age 13,575 By children between one and five years 6,748 HEALTH VISITING Number of visits during the year by all Health Visitors working in this area: — To expectant mothers—First visits 367 Total visits 542 To children under one year of age—First visits 981 Total visits 3,435 To children between the age of one and five years—Total visits 3,383 MIDWIFERY SERVICE Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. Only 19.1% of the total births were home confinements. The bulk of the hospital confinements were accepted at Central Middlesex and Queen Charlotte's Hospitals, the table below giving the distribution: — Central Middlesex Hospital 39.1% Queen Charlotte's Hospital 28.4% Hammersmith Hospital 2.3% Other Hospitals 10.7% Nursing Homes 0.4% 16 Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's midwives attending) 19.1% ANTE-NATAL CLINIC Avenue Road Wednesday afternoons.

The following table shows the number of attendances made throughout the year: — Number of new cases attending during the year 507 Total number who attended during the year 601 Total number of attendances made 2,336 Average number who attended per session 14.1 POST-NATAL CLINICS There were no specific post-natal clinics as the majority of patients return to hospital for this examination. The domiciliary cases who had been attended by Queen Charlotte's Midwives also attended the post-natal clinic at the hospital. Only five women attended the local ante-natal clinic for their post-natal examination. ANTE-NATAL EXERCISES Avenue Road One session weekly. Pierrepoint Road Two sessions weekly. 109 new patients were taken on during the year and there was a total of 826 attendances, an average of 6.5 per session.

One afternoon and one evening clinic weekly were held at Trinity Way, East Acton. No new patients were referred for advice in 1957. HOME HELP SCHEME At the end of the year there were 4 full-time Home Helps, and 63 part-time Staff. The following table shows the number of cases actually attended: — Maternity T_ 36 Tuberculosis 12 Chronic Sick ...... ...... 457 Other cases 47 18 SECTION D INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES, SCABIES AND OTHER CONDITIONS DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION The extension of the Poliomyelitis vaccination scheme to the younger age groups caused some temporary dislocation of the Diphtheria immunisation programme, but it is expected that this will re-adjust itself as the new techniques of inoculation fall into regular sequence. Following a report of the Medical Research Council, the use of combined Diphtheria and Whooping Cough vaccine was discontinued in July 1957 on the advice of the Central Health Services Council, and an alum-free diphtheria toxoid and a plain whooping cough vaccine given singly, were adopted at our clinics and recommended to the general practitioners for their use. The report, based on statistical evidence, showed that there is a risk of provoking poliomyelitis in using antigens in combination, and that this risk is minimal when non alum precipitated antigens are used singly. The change in material of course means more frequent injections but these can be spread over the first 12 months of life so that protection against Diphtheria, Smallpox, Whooping Cough and Poliomyelitis can be completed before the first birthday, with reinforcing or booster doses of Diphtheria toxoid in the fifth and tenth years. This explains the striking reduction in the number of " boost " doses and Schick tests which were formerly given 'every three years. The protected child population at the end of 1957 is as follows : Children under 5 years of age 2,541 Children 5-15 years 8,721 and the figures of work carried out during 1957 are given below: DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION, 1957 Total number of under 5s inoculated 587 Total number of over 5s inoculated 23 Boost dose after 3 years 614 Schick Test after 3 years—Negative 119 Positive 3 Primary Schick Test—Negative 8 Positive 2 19 POLIOMYELITIS IMMUNISATION Inoculation against Poliomyelitis proceeded more or less regularly throughout the year, though supplies of vaccine were small and there were frequent delays in delivery. From January 1957 onwards, general practitioners were given the opportunity to take part in the arrangements, and parents who had already registered their children for vaccination by the local authority were able to transfer to their own doctor if they so desired. In May, the scheme, which up to then had been limited to those children born in the years 1947 to 1954 inclusive, was extended to those born in 1955 and 1956, but although parents were invited to register these children it was not possible to commence their injections until November. In December the further extension of the scheme to include expectant mothers, and children born in the years 1943-46, was being formulated and the decision to import American and Canadian Salk vaccine made this a reality early in the New Year. The number of children who had completed the course of immunisation against Poliomyelitis at 31st December, 1957, was only 1,884 whilst a further 300 had received their first injection. The delays in delivery of vaccine had resulted in there being a waiting list of 2,034 but with the advent of the Salk vaccine this figure was speedily reduced by January and February of 1958. 20 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR (Corrected), Notifiable Disease Cases notified in whole District At Ages—Years Ward Distribution Hospital Cases At all ages Under 1 year 1—2 3—4 5—9 10—14 15—24 25—44 45—64 Over 64 N.E.

Of the total notifications 919 were in respect of measles compared with 97 last year. Poliomyelitis Twelve cases of poliomyelitis were confirmed during the year, 6 of which had some paralysis. Cases of poliomyelitis are notified as paralytic when there are or have been, signs of weakness or paralysis either permanent or transient. Four of the paralytic and five of the non-paralytic cases occurred in children under 15 years of age. Unfortunately a girl aged 6£ years died from bulbar poliomyelitis. None of the cases had been vaccinated against the disease. Food Poisoning Forty-seven cases of food poisoning or suspected food poisoning were notified, none of them being associated with an outbreak. In four cases salmonella organisms were responsible for the illness, the causative agent not being discovered in the remainder. 22 TUBERCULOSIS Age Periods NEW CASES DEATHS Respiratory Non-Respiratory Respiratory Non-Respiratory Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female 0 — — — — — — — — — 1 — — — — 1 — — — — 5 — — — — 1 — — — — 15 — 3 1 — — — — — — 25 — 4 4 2 2 — 1 1 —* 35 — 4 1 — — — — — —. 45 — 5 2 1 1 — 1 — 55 — 7 1 — — 1 — — — 65 upwards 3 3 — — 4 1 — 1 26 12 3 5 5 2 2 — 23 STATEMENT OF PARTICULARS APPEARING ON THE REGISTER OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS—1957 Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total (a) Number of cases of tuberculosis on the Register at the commencement of the year 638 males 451 females 93 males 107 females 1,289 (b) Number of cases notified for the first time during the year 26 males 12 females 3 males 5 females 46 (c) Number of cases previously removed from the Register which have been restored thereto during the year 1 males — females — males — females 1 (d) Number of cases added, to the Register other than by notification during the year 23 males 23 females — males — females 46 (e) Number of cases removed from the Register during the year 33 males 33 females 3 males 8 females 77 (f) Number of cases remaining on the Register at the end of the year 655 males 453 females 93 males 104 females 1,305 SCABIES AND VERMINOUS CONDITIONS As in previous years, cases suffering from the above conditions have been referred to the Kensington Medicinal Baths for cleansing treatment.

Eleven persons were treated for scabies. 24 SECTION E HOUSING I am indebted to the Borough Engineer for the following information showing the progress made since the end of the war. Temporary Prefabricated Dwellings. Occupied 31.12.57 208 New Permanent Dwellings. (1) Within the Borough: Completed and occupied 31.12.57 1,031 (2) Outside the Borough: Completed and occupied 31.12.57 435 SECTION F SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. Waste of water has been notified to the Metropolitan Water Board on 28 occasions and, in addition to saving a measure of water supply, these notifications have been the means of preventing nuisance from dampness in many cases. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and in the course of the year a total of 64 samples were submitted to the Council's analyst or pathologist for examination as to chemical or bacteriological content, and the results generally indicated a satisfactory supply. 25 DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are connected to the sewerage system which discharges, by an arrangement with the L.C.C., into the London sewers. Stormwater is filtered and emptied into the Thames. PUBLIC CLEANSING The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1957 was 19,945 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 3,371 tons. All was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 1,804 tons of salvage were sold. RODENT CONTROL Test baiting of public sewers and treatment as necessary have been maintained and this work contributes largely to the improved conditions in the matter of infestation on the surface. The services of the Council's Rodent Destruction staff continue to be divided between work of destruction of newly discovered rats and mice by intensive treatment and regular visitation and examination of business premises to prevent infestation. The Borough is free from serious infestation. Investigation, destruction and maintenance have entailed a total of 5,538 visits by the Rodent Operatives, 1,742 to business premises and 3,796 to dwellings, in addition to inspections by the Public Health Inspectors as noted elsewhere. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1991 Under the above Act, seventeen premises are registered for the manufacture of articles of upholstery, toys, etc., and three premises were licensed for the storing of rag flock. In the course of inspections it has been noted that rag flock and other filling materials are stored and used under hygienic conditions. COMPLAINTS The number of complaints registered at the counter was 987 and by letter 238. 26 INSPECTION OF FACTORIES The number of factories in the Borough is 703 and these have been subject to inspection by the Public Health Inspectors to ascertain that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and regulations as to sanitary accommodation are complied with. The usual work of inspection of factory canteens has been maintained, and advice given as necessary as to fitness or otherwise of food for human consumption. The home addresses of 61 outworkers engaged in work at home for Factories within and outside the Borough, have been visited to ascertain hygienic conditions and freedom from infectious disease. 27 FACTORIES ACT, 1937 PART I OF THE ACT 1.

Inspections of registered food premises are carried out from time to time and further action taken as necessary to ensure the premises and method of production being maintained at a satisfactory standard. Members of the Public Health Inspectors staff from time to time give lectures with film strip displays to stimulate and maintain interest in food hygiene and the general work of the Public Health Department. FOOD INSPECTION Reference to special examinations of consignments of food follow in this section of the report and while details of the quantity condemned are noted, it is not practicable to collate total quantities. The amount of food-stuffs surrendered owing to deterioration or damage is largely related to the extensive work of food manufacture and distribution in the Borough. There are two large wholesale grocery Depots within the Borough, and hence surrenders of canned and packeted goods are made to this Authority; these surrenders constitute the major part of such foodstuff noted. The following list collated for convenience shows some details of the surrendered food-stuffs: Bacon 691 lbs. Cream 176 tins Fish, wet 3 stone ,, tinned 823 tins 34 Flour and Flour Products 53 pkts. Fruit, tinned 23,512 tins Ham, tinned 86 lbs. ,, fresh 116 lbs. Meat: — Fresh 14,306 lbs. Tinned 1,869 tins Corned beef 278 tins Offal 540 tins Milk, Condensed 1,108 tins Pastes, Pickles, etc. 78 jars Poultry: — Chickens 15 ,, 9 pkts. Preserves 513 tins Puddings, sweet and savoury 346 tins Soup, Strained Foods, etc. 693 tins Vegetables 3,759 tins Miscellaneous 201 jars, etc. DISPOSAL OF CONDEMNED FOOD There has been no change in the methods of disposing of condemned and surrendered food noted in the report. At the large slaughterhouse and bacon factory in the Borough all diseased or infected carcases, and parts of carcases, are destroyed in special plant producing inedible material—bone meal, fertiliser, etc.— under supervision of the Council's Meat Inspectors. Apart from condemned food material dealt with at these slaughterhouse premises all surrendered diseased, or unsound, food is disposed of for animal feeding purposes, or otherwise as appropriate. 35 FOOD COMPLAINTS There were 26 complaints as to unsound food, etc., and in 3 cases the Council instituted legal proceedings. Details are as follows:— Date of Hearing Offence Result 25- 9-57 Mould in wrapped bread Fined £10 Costs £10-10-0 25- 9-57 Nail in bread Fined £10 Costs £ 3- 3-0 20-11-57 Nail in bread Fined £10 Costs £15-15-0 MILK There are only two dairies in the Borough and the practice of distributing milk wholesale in bottles from large bottling depots to local depots, for delivery by roundsmen, or over the counter in milk shops remains. 112 samples of milk were taken throughout the Borough and following submission to the Pathological Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, the results of the bacteriological examinations indicated that generally satisfactory conditions of processing and storage were maintained. The wholesale, pasteurising and bottling centre in Bollo Lane has continued in operation without cause for complaint, and 21 empty bottles taken from the filling lines for examination as to sterility, were found to be sterile. The following licences were granted under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasturised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1953, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954. Dealers' Licences:— Tuberculin Tested Milk 19 Pasteurised Milk 3ft Sterilised Milk supplementary Licences:— 31 Tuberculin Tested Milk 11 Pasteurised Milk 12 Sterilised Milk 12 123 \ 36 ICE-CREAM The number of manufacturers of ice-cream in the Borough is now 4. Each of them is equipped to produce pasteurised ice-cream, and production is in every way in accord with the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1947/1952. There are 140 premises where ice-cream is not manufactured, but where the commodity is sold in the main from pre-packed stocks. During the year 229 samples were taken, 155 of ice-cream manufactured in the Borough, and 74 from shops or itinerant vendors trading in icecream manufactured outside the Borough. The high bacteriological standard reflected in the results of examination of samples of ice-cream, together with inspection of plant and premises, has shown that processing and storage conditions are satisfactory and well maintained. MEAT INSPECTION AT SLAUGHTERHOUSES Regular slaughtering of pigs at the slaughterhouse of T. Wall and Sons has grown during the year and has necessitated the permanent attendance of a larger staff of the Local Authority in the course of meat inspection, with increased hours of overtime duty.

As these deficiencies were slight and as samples taken from other churns of milk from this same source were quite satisfactory no further action was taken. " The two samples of hot milk shown as unsatisfactory were both obtained from a cafe in your area; each was slightly deficient in milk solids other than fat and an official caution was sent to the vendor. / 40 Drugs \ " A sample of tincture of iodine was found to contain iodine slightly in excess of the maximum permitted by the British Pharmacopoeia. Attempts were made to purchase a follow-up sample but the shopkeeper in question had no further stock. Cakes " Flour confectionery was exposed for sale by a retailer and labelled " Coffee Butter Cream Gateau ".A sample was purchased and the Public Analyst certified that the filling consisted of imitation cream. The retailer received official cautions in respect of the false labelling and of the sale of this food. Fruit (Fresh, Canned and Dried) " A retailer who supplied Packham's Triumph pears when William pears were demanded was cautioned for his offence. Meat and Meat Products " A retail butcher in your area was found to be selling fresh meat containing 301 parts per million of the preservative sulphur dioxide; preservatives of any kind are prohibited in fresh meat. This shokpeeker was prosecuted and fined £10 and ordered to pay £5-13-0d. costs. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953. " 126 inspections of shops were undertaken to ensure that the Marking Orders relating to certain imported foodstuffs made under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926, were complied with. 460 separate displays of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry, honey and dried fruit, were examined, and in addition a number of test purchases were made. At one greengrocer's shop imported raw tomatoes from the Canary Islands and apples imported from America were found, neither of which were marked with the necessary indication of origin. Proceedings were instituted against the retailer concerned and he was fined £1 in respect of each offence and ordered to pay £2 2s. Od. costs. 41 Labelling of Food Order "At 31 premises 115 articles of pre-packed food were examined to see that they bore a label which gave a clear statement of the designation of the food and, in the case of compound foods, the ingredients, and also the name and address of the packer or labeller. No infringement of this Order was detected. False or Misleading Descriptions " As in previous years a considerable amount of work has been done in the detailed scrutiny of advertisements and the labels on pre-packed foods, and taking suitable action in those cases where a label or advertisement contains a false or misleading description of the food to which it relates. This work is of benefit to the whole County irrespective of where within the County offences may be detected. During the year under review corrective action has been secured in respect of salmon with potato salad, crystallized jelly, pineapple slices, pure egg mundelech, cherry juice, lime juice, imitation cream, cream filled biscuits, cream filled Easter eggs and cheese. In every case the person responsible agreed to make necessary suitable amendments to labels as a result of my representations. In no case was it necessary to institute proceedings. Special Designated Milk " During the year in question one licence was issued by my Council in respect of the use of the special designation " pasteurised " for milk processed within your area. These premises were regularly inspected, and compliance with the requirements of the Act and of the appropriate Regulations was maintained. 29 samples of pasteurised milk were taken, all of which were certified as being satisfactory. Safe Milk " In addition to the foregoing, 13 samples of raw milk were procured within your Borough and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli. None was found contaminated." 42 SECTION H DISEASES OF ANIMALS Throughout the year, the Borough remained free from any outbreak of notifiable disease, although there were numerous outbreaks throughout the country which necessitated exercising the utmost vigilance to see that no animals were moved into the Borough from infected areas. SECTION J ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION There has been no major change in the siting or recording of the three deposit gauge and seven lead peroxide stations and analyses have been maintained throughout the year. ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY THE LEAD PEROXIDE METHOD The monthly figures for each station for the years 1956 and 1957 are shown on page 43 and the 1957 figures are illustrated graphically on page 44. The station with the highest monthly figure—4.5—was Wesley Road and that with the highest average figure—2.6—was Bashley Road. The station with the lowest monthly figure—0.38—and with the lowest average figure—1.1—was Acacia Road. The average of all stations for the year was 1.9 which is below that of the previous year. DEPOSIT GAUGES The monthly figures for each station are shown statistically on page 45 and graphically on page 44. The yearly average figure—15.55 tons/sq. mile—has fallen below that of the previous year although the amount of combustible material in the deposit has again increased by a small amount. Once again the station with the greatest monthly deposit— 26.20 tons/sq. mile — and the greatest average deposit — 18.19 tons/sq. mile — was Bashley Road. The Kendal Avenue gauge showed the lowest monthly deposit of 10.68 tons/sq. mile and the lowest average deposit of 13.97 tons/sq. mile. 43 ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY LEAD PEROXIDE INSTRUMENTS Weight of S03 in Milligrams per 100 Square Centimetres per day.

Schools Four school departments have been visited and case discussions have taken place with Head Teachers. Attendance I Attendances have been good at all clinical sessions except during school holidays when a considerable drop was noticed. More parents are attending with their children and taking a practical part in their training. SPECIAL SCHOOL The School for Educationally Sub-normal Children was open for the whole of 1957 and at the end of the year 40 children were on the roll. During the year 7 new cases were admitted. TUBERCULOSIS — SPECIAL SURVEYS During the year the Tuberculin Patch Test was applied to all new entrants in the Infants' Schools. All known contacts and children who had a primary infection prior to school entry were not included in this survey. Total number patch tested 805 Total number negative 803 Total number found to be positive 2 One of the cases found to be positive had already been vaccinated with B.C.G. but the mother did not mention this at the routine medical inspection when the patch testing was done. The other case was sent to the Ealing Chest Clinic, it was confirmed that his T.B. test was positive but no significant abnormality in the chest x-ray was found. He is still under observation. Four special surveys were carried out on school children. In an infants' school a case of miliary tuberculosis occurred. 50 The class mates were patch tested, these numbered 36. One was positive and was referred to the Ealing Chest Clinic, one was not patch tested as she already had had B.C.G. (her mother was the patient). Five of the children had left the school, but in each case the respective Area Medical Officer was notified. In two senior schools, special surveys were carried out on children who had been in contact with a classmate who had developed pulmonary tuberculosis. Sixty-four children and fifteen staff were involved. Arrangements were made for the staff to be x-rayed, also for one girl who had left school (overage). This was done with satisfactory results. Of the fifty-four children who were mantoux tested, fourteen were positive reactors and attended the Ealing Chest Clinic for x-ray. All x-rays were within nromal limits. Four absentees of the mantoux testing were sent to the Ealing Chest Clinic for investigation. All had satisfactory results. Three girls had recently attended hospital. The parents of two boys refused treatment, these were followed up by home visits. The fourth special survey was carried out in a senior school as a student teacher was found to be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. It was found that there were one hundred and thirtythree class and nine staff contacts. The staff attended Central Middlesex Hospital for x-ray and all with satisfactory results. Of the 133 class contacts, 57 had previously been included in the B.C.G. scheme. Of the remaining 76, 55 had a mantoux test, 52 of these were negative, but only one of the 3 positive was sent for x-ray (this was negative). 18 children were sent for mass x-rays and these were all negative. One parent preferred to take her daughter to see her own doctor, one child's parents were abroad and the guardian did not feel free to give consent to a skin test and one already attended the Ealing Chest Clinic. HEALTH EDUCATION In several schools regular health talks and demonstrations were given by the School Health Staff.
