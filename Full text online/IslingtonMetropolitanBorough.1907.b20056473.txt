To the Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Islington. Gentlemen, It is my pleasing duty to submit for your consideration my report on the health and sanitary condition of your Borough for the year 1907, during which period I am glad to be able to state its inhabitants enjoyed very good health, the death-rate being as low as 14.6 per 1,000, and that this is the third year in succession that it has been below 15.0. The mortality among infants, it is very satisfactory to note, was also low; indeed the rate (117 per 1,000 births) is the lowest of which there is any record. This small mortality was, however, entirely due to the very favourable meteorological conditions that prevailed during the year, especially during its third qnarter. I am sorry I cannot congratulate the Borough on its birth-rate, 24.58 per 1,000 of its inhabitants, which is the lowest hitherto chronicled in Islington. In conclusion I desire to thank the Public Health Committee for their kindly consideration and assistance, and also the staff of the Public Health Department for their ungrudging help in carrying out the very onerous work of the department. To Mr. J. R. Leggatt, the Superintendent and Chief Sanitary Inspector, I desire to express my indebtedness for his hearty co-operation ; and to Mr. King, the Chief Clerk, I would convey my thanks for his valuable assistance in preparing the several reports which from time to time have been printed and laid before you. I am, Your faithful servant, Medical Officer of Health. viii. SUMMARY of Vital Statistics, 1907.

THE POPULATIONS, AREAS AND DENSITIES OF THE SUB REGISTRATION DISTRICTS, THE WARDS AND THE BOROUGH. 3 [1907 REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR YEAR 1907. SUB DISTRICTS, WARDS, AREA, POPULATION AND DENSITY. Sub-Registration Districts.—Islington is divided into seven sub-districts by the Registrar General for the convenience of those of its inhabitants who from time to time may have occasion to register a birth or a death. In the earliest days of registration, that is to say in 1838, it was split into two districts, East and West Islington, which were separated from each other by a line running through the centre of Upper Street to Highbury, and thence through the Highgate Road, which is now known as Holloway Road, to the northern boundary of the parish, and which was lined at intervals with terraces of private houses. At this time the population of the parish was comparatively small, numbering 55,776 persons, according to the census of 1841, who were housed for the most part in the Upper Street, the Lower Street, now known as Essex Road, in the Back Street, better known to-day as Liverpool Road, and in the streets leading off them. The long road, which we call Caledonian Road, was at that time known at its south or King's Cross end as Battle Bridge Road, a historic name which one could wish had been retained, and north of the Regent's Canal as Thornhill Bridge Road, and was throughout its entire length almost bare of houses, except only at that part of it where St. George's Road, although it now terminates in Roman Road, ran into it from Holloway Road. In those days Lower Street ceased at Rotherfield Street, beyond which point there was hardly a house, although the road itself continued on under the name of Balls Pond Road to the point where it met St. Paul's Road, and thence to Dalston It is, however, only this latter portion of the road which is known to-day under that name, the more western portion, with Lower Street, being now hidden under the title of Essex Road. Prior even to that date the continuation of Lower Street was called Lower Road. At that time B 2 4 1907] too, there was an Islington Market, but it was situated on the east side of Balls Pond Road (Essex Road), nearly a third of a mile north of Rotherfield Street. Although the parish continued to grow rapidly, it was not until January 1st, 1884, that the Registrar General thought fit to further increase the number of its sub-registration districts for the convenience of the people, at which time "the district of Islington, consisting of the two sub-districts of West Islington (population 121,452) and East Islington (population 101,413), was divided into four sub-districts, viz., Upper Holloway (population (57,946), Islington SouthWest (population 100,976), Islington South-East (population 01,895), and Highbury (population 52,048)."* Thus it is seen that the population of Highbury alone was at this period nearly as great as that of the whole parish in 1841. This division of the parish remained in force for ten years, until 1900, when the Registrar General again increased the number of sub-districts by dividing it into five sub-districts, namely, Upper Holloway, (population 89,049) Lower Holloway (population 41,618), Highbury (population 62,092), Barnsbury (population 55,445), and Islington South-East (population 77,666). This change was accomplished by abolishing the sub-district of Islington South-West, and dividing part of it into the sub-districts now named Lower Holloway and Barnsbury, and adding the remaining portion to the sub-district of Islington South-East. A further sub-division of the borough, which came into force on August 1st 1901, was made by the Registrar General, who divided the large sub-district of Upper Holloway into three sub-districts, Tufnell (population 31,995), Upper Holloway (33,978), and Tollington (33,922), so that there were then seven subdistricts in Islington, and so they remain at the present time. The populations of the several sub-districts even now remain very unequal, for they range from 34,441 (estimated) in Tufnell, to 70,524 (estimated) in Islington South-East. The last change has, however, been greatly to the advantage of the residents in the northern part of the borough, who have now a registrar living in each of its wards. The particulars as to the areas, densities, and populations of these sub-districts, as well as of the borough, are set out in Table I. Wards.—The borough is divided into eleven wards for municipal purposes, four of which, Tufnell, Upper Holloway, Tollington, and Lower Holloway, are coterminous with the registration sub-districts and bear the same names. The populations of the wards vary considerably, although perhaps * Registrar General's 47th Annual Report. 5 [1907 not quite so much as the sub-districts do. Thus in Lower Holloway there are 41,751 residents, and in St. Mary 17,484, so that the former is two and one-third times more populous than the latter. The full particulars as to their areas, densities and populations are to be found in Table II. Population. The population of the borough was estimated to have reached at the middle of the year 347,017 persons, of whom 164,985 were presumed to be males and 182,032 females. It is by no means certain, however, that these figures are exact, because the census return on which they are based, had been taken six years previously. In calculating them it is presumed that the rate of the increase of the population had continued to be the same as that which had obtained in the decennium 1891-1900. The number of persons living at the several age periods was also estimated on the same return, and they, too, possibly are not quite correct. In any case, the error cannot be very great, because the population is now increasing (if at all) very slowly, so that the several birth and death-rates based on them will be very little affected. Full particulars as to the number of persons living at nine age periods are given in Table IV. Table I.

The record of marriages in Islington since 1841, given in decades and as abstracted and collected from the Registrar-General's annual reports is as follows:— Table VIII.

During the present decade, to which the present return is no exception, this rate has been well maintained, for, while it has been as high as 18 08, it has not fallen below 17 18 per 1,000 of the population.

The Registrar General, in his last annual report (1906), when discussing the marriage rate, says that the total population does not afford the most satisfactory method of measuring it, because of the variations which occur from time to time in the number and age constitution of marriageable men and women in the population. How important these changes have been is shown by the circumstance that the proportion of batchelors in 1,000 males aged 15 years and upwards, rose from 884 in 1891 to 411 in 1901, and that among 1,000 females aged 15 years and upwards, the proportion of spinsters increased from 361 to 395, and also that the proportion of widowed persons steadily decreased. And he also gives some very interesting figures which the writer has abstracted from his report (Table B), which undoubtedly point to a decrease in the marriage rate, in England and Wales, when based on the number of persons living at a marriageable age, that is to say above 15 years of age. 1870-72 57.2 per 1,000 of the unmaried and widowed population aged 15 years and upwards. 1880-82 51.5 „ „ „ „ 1890-92 49.8 „ „ „ „ 1900-02 48.7 „ „ „ „ 1903-05 47 0 1906 47.7 „ „ „ „ These changes, however, can have had very little influence in Islington, for as we have seen, the marriage rate, calculated on the total population, has been fairly constant, although undoubtedly there have been considerable changes in the population. Indeed, this is shown by the fact that the number of persons now living in the borough over 15 years of age is 245,596, whereas if no change had occurred in the age constitution of the borough since the census of 1891, it would have been 234,600, which means that there are now nearly eleven thousand more people fifteen years and upwards living in Islington than there would have been if the proportions of people living at the several age periods had remained constant since 1891. The marriage rate for last year, on the basis of persons over fifteen years, would have been, on the 1891 proportions 25.25, and on the 1901 proportions 24.96, per 1,000 persons at a marriageable age. There is undoubtedly a tendency among men and women to marry at a later period of life than formerly, and, indeed, the Registrar General indicates this fact in his Annual Report for 1906, where he says that, "among the persons who married in 1906,43 per 1,000 of the husbands and 146 per 1,000 13 [1907 of the wives were minors. These are the lowest proportions of minors that have been recorded since 1847 among men, and the lowest since 1848 among women." He also gives a table from which the following figures have been abstracted. Periods. Minors in 1,000 Marriages. Husbands. Wives. 1876-80 77.8 217.0 1881-85 73.0 215.0 1886-90 63.2 200.2 1891-95 56.2 l82.6 1896-1900 51.2 168.0 1901 49.6 159.9 1902 47.0 153.7 1903 45.7 152.3 I904 45.6 152.7 1905 43.8 146.9 1906 43.0 14.57 These figures indicate very clearly the tendency of modern times to delay the period of marriage, which of course reacts on the birth-rate. BIRTHS. The births registered in Islington during 1907 numbered 8,531, and were 894 below the average of the preceding ten years. They represented a birth rate of 24.58 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with a mean rate of 27.15 in the preceding ten years. The records of Islington may be searched in vain to discover such a low birth-rate, and if that for 1906 be excepted, one must go back sixty-five years, to 1842, to discover one approachto it, for in that year it was 25.28 per 1,000. Since 1891, at which time the birth-rate was 30.61, it has steadily continued to fall, until at last in 1906 the lowest point was reached, only, however to be beaten by the return for 14 1907] 1907. This fall in the birth-rate means much more than people readily grasp. Thus, for instance, if the birth-rate, which averaged 37 2 per 1,000 of the population in the decade 1861-70, had been maintained, there would have been 12,909 births registered in Islington in 1907, or 4,378 more than were recorded. This is a serious matter, especially as similar decreases are occurring in nearly all the populous towns, and, indeed, throughout the length and breadth of the land. The causes of this decrease were touched upon in the report for 1906, and were ascribed to:— 1. The deliberate act of married persons not to procreate children. 2. The later age at which women marry. 3. Variation in the proportion of women at the child-bearing age in the population. 4. Variation in the marriage-rate. 5. Decrease in illegitimate births. From an enquiry made by the Registrar General it appears that if a comparison is made among European countries, it will be found that in the years 1880-2 there were no fewer than six States in which the fertility of wives was less than that recorded in England and Wales; whereas twenty years later (1900-2) the rate of fertility among married women in England and Wales was, with the exception of France, lower than that recorded in any other European country.* The decline of the birth-rate in most Continental countries, according to the Registrar General, shows no signs of being arrested, for in all the European States for which returns are available, the rates for the year 1905 were, with the exception of that recorded in Spain, below the averages of the previous ten years. That the decrease of births in this country is not merely due to the decrease in illegitimate births, is proved by the enquiry which the Registrar General made with respect to the fertility of wives at the child-bearing ages in the several European States as well as in the State of the Australian Commonwealth, which shows that there were only two States—Austria and Spain—in which the birth-rate, during the 20 years (1881—1901) showed a tendency to increase, and that this also applied to Ireland. In all of the remaining countries a decrease in human fertility had taken place in the period under review, ranging from 9.5 to as much as 19.8 percent. There were two countries, Italy and Norway, in which the fall was only 2.5 and 3.7 per cent. respectively; in five others, Switzerland, Sweden, the German Empire, the Netherlands, and Denmark, * Registrar General's 68th Annual Report, p. xx. 15 [1907 the decreases ranged from 6.4 to 9.8 per cent., in Scotland the decrease was 12.7 per cent., in England and Wales 17 7 per cent, in France 19 7 per cent., and in Belgium 19.8 per cent. In New Zealand and in the States of the Australian Commonwealth the decrease ranged from 23.2 to 30.6 per cent.* The obvious conclusion to be drawn from these statistics is that there must be some universal cause operating throughout these civilised communities to account for the phenomenon of the general decline in human fertility, apart from any decrease which may be due to changes in the age constitution of married women at conceptive ages, and that there is strong ground for the assumption that in greater or lesser degree, the chief cause has been the deliberate restriction of child-bearing on the part of the people themselves.† In our Colonies there is, with a marked exception, the same startling decline in fertility, to which the Medical Officer of Health for Montreal calls attention, for he finds that the birth-rate among the Protestant community was 23.7 per 1,000, whereas among the French Canadians—the Roman Catholic community in the main—the birth-rate was 43.5 per 1,000 of the population. The French Canadians are a fertile race, of whom a recent writer, referring particularly to those of the French provinces in Canada, says:—"It is a land of families—fifteen is a usual number—and the enormous development in population of the French Canadians, contrasted with the falling birth-rate in the Anglo-Saxon stock, is likely to have strange results in the future of the race."‡ In the United States the matter is also assuming importance, because, as Dr. Charles Harrington, an American Sanitarian, points out that in his country the same decline is to be noticed among the descendants of the original colonists and earlier immigrants, whereas in colonial times and in the earlier years of national independence, families of a dozen, fifteen and more were exceedingly common, while nowadays one of six or eight becomes a subject for comment, surprise, and even ridicule. The large families to to-day, he adds, are mainly those of the more recently arrived immigrants and of their first generation. § There is one significant circumstance in connection with these facts:—namely that it is among Roman Catholic communities alone that there is little or no diminution in the birth-rate among married women at the child-bearing age. It is so in Ireland, where, despite the emigration of a large number of its young *Op. cit. lxii. †Op. cit., lxiii. ‡" Canadian Life in Town and Country."—Daily Neius, 30th July, 1905. §"Practical Hygiene." Harrington, p. 695. 16 1907] population, the fertility of its married women remains practically constant; it is so in Austria, in Spain, and among French Canadians. It seems, then, to be due to a matter of religious observance, for without doubt the Roman Catholic Church looks frowningly on attempts to prevent the advent of children by the use of preventive measures by its members. This is a serious subject for the Anglo-Saxon race, and if the paramount cause be as indicated—and it seems tolerably certain—it may lead to its gradual extinction, for it must not be forgotten that animal organs which are not allowed to fulfil their functions gradually lose their power to perform them, and so in several generations may became practically useless. This question is then not only a national one, but a moral one, and with this phase of it the Protestant Churches should deal. It is to be regretted that those passages in the marriage service of the Church of England which declare what marriage was ordained for are now often omitted by many clergymen officiating at marriages, as being too indelicate for modern gentle ears to hear, but which their forefathers ever since "The First Prayer Book of Edward VI." was compiled, in 1549, have heard without interruption and without any feeling of shame, and who also, in the old-time language, "duely consideryng the causes for the whiche matrimonie was ordeined," entered into the "honourable estate," and were instructed that "one cause was the procreacion of children, to be brought up in the feare and nurture of the Eord, and prayse of God." When clergy of the Church omit this passage in its more modern and slightly modified form, they do a wrong to their Church and a wrong to their people and to the nation, and marriage ceases to be "a remedie agaynst sinne," or an institution " to avoid fornicacion." There is then a clear duty indicated to the clergy, and it is to be hoped that the national church at least will endeavour to see that its own teachings from the earliest dawn of the Church of England are not set at naught. This is a difficult matter to discuss and to deal with, and, indeed, many scientific men fear to give offence by speaking out plainly, lest they should be charged with indelicacy. It may be that as truth is strong, it will prevail; but nevertheless, it behoves those who are in a position of responsibility and who know what these causes may lead the nation to, to speak out with no uncertain voice, for undoubtedly this wilful determination to have no children will in the end break up the "family," which has been so characteristic a feature of Anglo-Saxon life from the earliest times. Persons, too, will come to the conclusion that if there need be no children in the married state, so, also, there need be none in a less binding association, and so the nation will become gradually less moral. Let the history of Greece, Byzantium and Rome be a warning to 17 [1907 our race, for "these powers ceased not so much from outside conquest as from an international decline in their fertility, with a consequent lack of men, and moral and physical deterioration of the race as a whole. Before it is too late let nations of to-day take to heart these lessons from the past!"* Lord Bacon knew and appreciated that the true greatness of a nation "consisteth essentially in population and breed of men"; and he also recognised in his day that "out of doubt, none of the past monarchies which in the memory of time have risen in the habitable world had so fair seeds and beginning as hath this state and this kingdom." We hear ever and again loud talk as to over-population, it crops up regularly, so that at times it becomes a perfect bugbear. In 1842 Dr. Farr, the great statistician, in his annual letter to the Registrar General, wrote: "the rate of progression (that is since the first census in 1801) has been such that, if it continue, the numbers will have doubled in 1850; double the number of families will exist, and must be supplied with subsistence in England ; but there will also be double the number of men to create subsistence and capital for her families, to man her fleets, to defend her inviolate hearths, to work mines and manufactories, to extend the commerce, to open new regions of colonization; and double the number of minds to discover new truths, to confer the benefits, and to enjoy the felicity of which human nature is susceptible."! And have not these words, written fifty-eight years ago, come true? And so too will they be true in the future; for the telephones, the telegraphs, fast inter-communication between countries, the inventions of scientific men, the great advances in chemical knowledge and the marvellous spread of civilization open out to-day a vista that could not be conceived, much less realised, fifty years ago, and yet there is pessimism. The fear is, not that there are too many men, but that there may be too few men, in view of the steady, continuous fall of the birth-rate of this country, which as we have seen, has been a great factor in determining the fate of ancient countries, which gave themselves up to vice, and to idleness. The Distribution of the Births in the Borough.—As may be very well imagined, owing to the differences in the social scale, the fertility of the people differed very considerably in the several sub-registration districts. It is no surprise, therefore, to find that in Highbury the rate was as low as 18.9 per 1,000 of its population, while in Barnsbury it reached 31.7, a discrepancy *Infant, Parent, and State." Heath, p. 48. †4th Annual Report of the Registrar General, 1842, p. 141. C 18 1907] of 12.8 per 1,000. This is a very serious difference. The births and birthrates in the several districts were as. follows:— Sub-Districts. Births. Birth-rates. Tufnell 745 21.63 Upper Holloway 1,023 28.08 Tollington 755 20.76 Lower Holloway 1,094 26.20 Highbury 1,278 18.90 Barnsbury 1,709 31.70 South-East Islington 1,927 25.18 The Borough 8,531 24.58 If, for comparative purposes, the birth-rate of the borough be taken as 100, then the comparative figures will be as follows:— Highbury 77 Tollington 84 Tufnell 88 The Borough 100 South-East Islington 102 Lower Holloway 107 Upper Holloway 114 Barnsbury 129 These figures show that the fertility of the inhabitants of Highbury, Tollington and Tufnell were respectively 23, 16, and 12 per cent. lower than the average rate of the borough, and that that of the people of South-East Islington, Lower Holloway, Upper Holloway, and Barnsbury were respectively 2, 7, 14, and 29 per cent. higher than it. With these facts before us, it may be well be asked, why is this so? The birth-rate of the borough is not large, indeed, compared with some of the great towns, it is very low; and therefore one wonders if it was a hyper-civilization that was the cause of the low rates in Highbury, Tollington, and Tufnell, or was the opposite the case in SouthEast Islington, Lower Holloway, Upper Holloway, and Barnsbury. Inasmuch is the birth-rate in none of these four districts was very high, it is to be feared that the answer to the query must be in the affirmative with respect to the three first mentioned districts. 19 [1907 TABLE X.

These births were in the proportion of 0.66 per 1,000 inhabitants. There has been a steady, if slow, decline in illegitimate births for over twenty-seven years. Thus during the years 1881-90 they averaged 348 per annum, in the decennium 1891-1900 272, and during the last seven years 241.

There were 5,079 deaths registered in the borough, as compared with an average, corrected for the increase of the population, of 5,552, or a decrease of 473. This is a very small return, as may be judged by the death-rate, which was 14.63 per 1,000 inhabitants. It must be considered highly satisfactory, and all the more so because this is the third occasion in successive years that the death-toll has been below 15.0 per 1,000 of the population. Thus in 1905 it was 14.44, in 1906 14.64, and 1907 14.63. In 1903 also the rate was only 14-27 per 1,000, while in 1904, although slightly higher, it was still low, being only 15.35. Any community, even a very small one, might well be proud of such a succession of low mortality returns, and, therefore, it is a matter of supreme satisfaction to find that the whilom "Merry" Islington is to-day essentially a "healthy" Islington, and if health brings happiness, as it ought to do, then, indeed, the borough may well retain its happy and ancient title. In the fiftieth annual report of the Medical Officer of Health, a table was given which showed the death-rate for each year since 1887, when the compulsory registration of deaths came into force, which the student of statistics will find interesting, but which is too long to reproduce. A digest of it in quinquennial periods has, however, been made, and is here set out. Death and Death-Rates in Quinquennial Periods, 1841-1905. Quinquennial. Mean Population. Total Deaths. Mean Death-rates. 1841-45 63,092 5,781 18.32 1846-50 82,444 8,252 20.01 1851-55 106,576 12,043 22.60 1856-60 136,132 13,966 20.51 1861-65 167,076 20,170 24.14 1866-70 195,983 24,564 25.06 1871-75 227,798 23,049 20.24 1876-80 261,970 26,628 20.33 1881-85 290,751 28,076 19.31 1886 90 308,963 27,517 17.81 1891-95 326,989 29,815 18.23 1896-1900 336,748 28,998 17.22 1901-05 339,154 26,026 15.34 25 [1907 In this table we see that there was a steady and persistent rise in the death-rate from 1841-45 to 1866-70, when it was as high as 25'06, after which time it steadily decreased until in 1901-05 it had fallen to 15-34, while at the present date it is, as already stated, as low as 14-63 per 1,000. The steadiness of the death-rate during the last three or four years has been remarkable, and it is to be hoped that, like a barometer steady at " set fair," it indicates a favourable outlook. The fall in the death-rate from 25-06 in the quinquennium 1866-70 to 14-63 is simply enormous, and means a saving in human lives which can be best appreciated when it is stated that it amounts to 3,618 per annum in our population of to-day. This is indeed something to have fought for and to be proud of ; but it must not be forgotten that it has only been attained by steady, diligent and persistent effort in various directions, not only by the late Vestry and the more recent Borough Councils, but also by the London County Council, as well as by educational influences, for it must be acknowledged that each and all have had their effect in bringing about such a happy state of affairs. It is very good, and because it is so, we must not rest upon our oars, but rather labour steadily to keep our mortality at its present low figure. When we recollect that the social status of the inhabitants of the population is declining, it seems a difficult, if not almost an impossible task to achieve, but unless the endeavour is made this end will not be attained. The transition stage that Islington is, and has been for some time, undoubtedly passing through with respect to the status of its population is a factor powerfully adverse to the fulfilment of the hope that so low a death-rate as we enjoy at present shall continue. Nevertheless the fight must be made, and the housing and the food of the people must more than ever be looked after, and also the enormous and unnecessary mortality among young children must be stopped, and the health visitor must become, and indeed will become, despite the pessimism of many people, a great influence for good in our midst by advising and teaching the mothers of the poorer classes how to keep their little children healthy, and their homes cleaner and brighter and more attractive, so that when the bread winner returns at the end of his day, he may not be driven by dirt and gloom and noisome smells, and crying children to the nearest public house, wherein to spend his hard-earned wages on alcoholic drinks, which at once ruins his body and pauperizes his home. The Sanitary Inspector has been the precursor in the sanitary crusade. He has battled, and most successfully, with the more difficult questions of house sanitation, and has, so to speak, cleansed the Augean stables of the more foul pollutions, and he still has his work to do in keeping the places that have been dealt with in a wholesome state. He must, however, be followed sooner or later by the health visitor, who is now recognised by thoughtful men and women who have studied this subject, as his necessary complement, for her work will be to complete what he has 26 1907] left undone, and which his sex debars him from effecting. This question of health visitors is discussed more fully in a later part of this report, to which reference should be made.* In the Medical Officer of Health's report for 1906 he showed that a change was taking place in the age incidence of the borough, and that that change lent itself, not to a decrease in the mortality, but to the reverse, although that effect is not very great in so large a population, amounting as it does, to about 83 deaths per annum. The Mortality in the Sub-registration Districts.—The mortality ranged from 12.07 per 1,000 of the population in Highbury, where 816 deaths were registered, to 17.60 per 1,000 in Barnsbury, where 949 deaths occurred. Between these came Tollington with 480 deaths and a death-rate of 13-20 per 1,000; Tufnell, with 482 deaths and a death-rate of 13.99 per 1,000; South-East Islington, with 1,149 deaths and a death-rate of 15.01 per 1,000; Upper Holloway, with 559 deaths and a death-rate of 15.34 per 1,000; Lower Holloway, with 044 deaths and a death-rate of 15.42 per 1,000. An inquiry into the vital statistics of these sub-districts during the last few years will be useful. Unfortunately, however, owing to the increase in their number, and their consequent sub-division into smaller districts, it is not possible to go farther back than 1901, when the present sub-districts were constituted. Tufnell. This sub-district was particularly healthy during the year, the deaths numbering 482, equal to a death-rate of 13.99 per 1,000, as compared with an average of 449 and a death-rate of 14.45 in the six years 1902-7. At no time in these six years can it be said to have been unhealthy, for the highest death-rate, registered in 1904, was only 17.18 per 1,000, while in 1900 it was as low as 12.70 Tufnell is no mean town in itself, for its population is now estimated at 34,441 persons, and it is, therefore, as large a community as the borough of Lowestoft. Upper Holloway, which lies immediately to the west of Tufnell, also enjoyed good health, as is indicated by its death-rate, which was 15.34 per 1,000 (representing 559 deaths), or slightly under the average of 15.59 during the six years 1902-7. Its mortality has been very constant during the last five years, varying only from 14.85 to 15.44 in a population of 30,425, which is a community of the size of Maidstone. * p. 227. 27 [1907 Tollington, which lies to the immediate east of Upper Holloway, and forms the north-east corner of the borough, is an exceptionally healthy locality, for during last year, although it enjoyed the low death-rate of 13.20 per 1,000 of its population, yet even this is slightly above its average of six years, namely 13.00. During these years its mortality rate has been as low as 11.82 per 1,000, as in 1905, although in 1902 it was 15.03. In 1906, however, it made its record return of 11.82 per 1,000 of its population. This is all the more remarkable because the population of this sub-district contains as many persons as Tunbridge Wells, which is no mean town. Lower Holloway, situated immediately to the South of Tufnell sub-district and at the west side of the borough, enjoyed a low death-rate in 1907, for its death-rate reached only 15.42 per 1,000 of its 41,751 inhabitants, as compared with its mean rate of 16.15 during the period 1902-7. When the mixed nature of the community is considered, these rates must be regarded as satisfactory. During the last six years its highest death-rate was 17.30, in 1906, and its lowest 14.87, in 1903. The number of its inhabitants is slightly more than that of Chatham. Highbury.—This sub-district, situated to the east of the borough, lies immediately to the south of Tollington, and is bounded on the east by Hackney, and on the south by Islington South-West. It is essentially a healthy district, and may fairly be ranked as one of the healthiest residential localities in London. Its death-rate during 1907 was as low as 12.07 per 1,000 of its population, which numbers 67,612 persons, while during the six years 1902-7 it was only 12.48 per 1,000. This low death-rate is the more remarkable because Highbury houses, in addition to the well-to-do class, a very considerable number of working people, who are apparently coming to it in increasing numbers. The wealthiest class are without doubt leaving this sub-district, and many of the large houses have consequently been unoccupied, or have been reconstructed as small flats. There has been, however, no decrease in the actual population, rather the reverse is the case, but nevertheless, its deathrate continues low. Since 1902, when it was 14.37 per 1,000, it has not been higher than 12.61, being in 1903 12.22 per 1,000, in 1904 11.79, in 1905 12.61, in 1900 11.63, and in 1907, as we have already seen, 12.07 per 1,000. Highbury, therefore, still remains one of the most healthy districts in London, and as it is only a few minutes' run thence to the City by rail, tube, or tram, its prosperity for many years to come ought to be assured. In point of population Highbury is larger than the borough of Hanley. Barnsbury.—To say that it is the least healthy of the sub-districts of Islington is not to lay a serious charge against it, for its death-rate in 1907 was 26 1907] no more than 17.60, and its mean death-rate for six years 17.59 per 1,000 of its population. It is to a very large degree a working man's district, and it is, as already shown, the most densely populated area in the borough, no fewer than 174 persons dwelling on each of its 309 acres. This is a very great density, and the wonder is, not that the death-rate of Barnsbury is so high as it is, but that it is so low. The district, it is estimated, contains 53,897 persons, and it is, therefore, so far as popnlation is concerned, as large as Stockton-onTees. South-east Islington, which is the most populous of the sub-registration districts, and, with the exception of Barnsbury, the most crowded part of the borough, is mainly a working man's district, and houses 140 persons on each of its 545 acres. Nevertheless, its death-rate in 1907 was only 15-01 per 1,000 of its inhabitants, and its mean death-rate during six years only 15.58. Such death-rates as these, occurring in so crowded a district, speaks well for its general sanitary state, and reflects credit on the borough. It may be truthfully asserted that there are few, if any, similar provincial sub-districts in the great towns with such densely packed working class populations which can show such low mortality returns as Barnsbury and South-East Islington. In point of population, it may be mentioned that this sub-district will rank with such a town as Coventry. Thus we see that each of the sub-districts during 1907, and, indeed, during the last six years, has presented most favourable mortality returns, and that the death toll is as low as can be reasonably expected, especially when it is recollected that no special and organised effort has been made to grapple with the burning question of the early deaths of so many very young children. The further lowering of the death-rate may probably be looked for in that direction by and bye, when the means to efficiently make the attempt have been provided. 29 [1907 TABLE XVI.

It will be noticed that four of them are also sub-registration districts, namely, Tufnell, Upper Holloway, Tollington, and Lower Holloway, whose deaths have already been discussed in the preceding pages. It remains only to state that in the remaining seven wards the deaths and death-rates were respectively:— Highbury 442 deaths — 12.58 per 1,000 inhabitants Mildmay 312 „ =12.41 „ Thornhill 591 „ =17.63 „ Barnsbury 358 „ =17.56 „ St. Mary's 254 „ =14.52 „ Canonbury 434 „ =12.99 „ St. Peter's 523 „ =15.85 The Ages at Death.—There was a decrease, when compared with the proceeding ten yesrs, at all ages up to and including 45-55. At the next age period there was an increase of 49 deaths, and at the period 65-75 of 95 deaths. At the period 75-85 they remained stationary, but above 85 there was an increase of 38. The decreased number of deaths between 0 and 55 amounted to 522, and the increased number over the latter age numbered 182. Vide Table XVIII,, page 33. The Mortality of Islington compared with that of other places.— It is satisfactory to note that the Islington death-rate of 14.6 per 1,000 compares favourably with the general death-rate of England and Wales, which was 15.0 per 1,000. It was also lower than the collective death-rate of the 76 great towns, which was 15.4 per 1,000, or a point above that of the 142 smaller towns, which was 14.5 per 1,000, but a point less than the deathrate of England and Wales, less the 218 town districts, that is to say the Rural Districts, where the mortality was in the ratio of 14.7 per 1,000 of their inhabitants. The Islington death-rate was lower than that experienced in Birmingham (16.2), Liverpool (19.0), Manchester (18.1), Leeds (15.3), and Sheffield (17.1); while with respect to the neighbouring boroughs it is found that the mortality of St. Pancras (15.0), Finsbury (18.7), and Shoreditch (20.5), was higher than that of Islington, and that that of Hornsey (8.6), Stoke Newington (11.5), and Hackney (13.6), was lower. 81 [1907 SEASONAL MORTALITY. First Quarter —In this quarter of the year there were 1,640 deaths recorded, as compared with a corrected average of 1,578 in the ten years 18971906. They were equal to an annual death-rate of 18.90 per 1,000 inhabitants, as against 18.19 in the years mentioned. The highest number of deaths occurred in the second week of January, and the lowest in the twelfth week of the quarter. It is notable that there was an increased mortality, when compared with that of the preceding ten years, at each age period except three, viz.,1-5 5-15, and 15-25 years. This was specially noticeable among persons between the ages of 65 and 75, when the excess of deaths numbered 51; between 75 and 85 it was 23; and above 85 years of age it was 22. The infantile mortality was also excessive for this period, for it was at the rate of 148 per 1,000 infants born, as compared with 125 per 1,000 in the corresponding quarters of the preceding ten years, and with 135 in the twenty years 1886-1905. Second Quarter.—There were 1,224 deaths registered, or 18 less than the corrected average of the corresponding quarters of the preceding ten years; and they represented an annual death-rate of 14.11 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, or 0.21 per 1,000 less than in the corresponding decennial periods. The deathrates ranged from 19.39 in the first week of April to 9.31 per 1,000 in the third week of June. The infantile mortality rate showed an improvement in this quarter, being at the rate of 102 per 1,000 as against a mean rate of 107 in the second quarters of 1897-1906, and 117 in the same period during- the twenty years 1886-1905. Third Quarter.—939 deaths were recorded, or 339 less than the corrected average number registered in the third quarters of the years 1897-1906; and were equal to the low annual death-rate of 10.82 per 1,000, as compared with a mean rate of 14.74 per 1,000. The mortality, in -proportion to the population, was the lowest ever recorded at this season of the year in Islington. This was due mainly to the decrease in the deaths of infants under one year old, which fell from an average of 411 to 116, or in other words, the infantile mortality rate dropped from a decennial mean rate of 179 per 1,000 births to 79, which is the lowest rate ever known in the borough. This decrease was, however, solely due to meteorological and atmospheric conditions, and not to any special effort that had been made in the borough. This subject is discussed more fully under that part of the report which deals with infant mortality. 32 1907] Fourth Quarter.—The mortality returns were remarkably good, as the deaths, which numbered only 1,276, as against an average of 1,452 in the fourth quarters of the preceding ten years, were equal to the low annual ratio of 14.70 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with a mean rate during 1897-1906 of 16.73 per 1,000. Only once previously has such a low death-rate been recorded at this season of the year, namely in 1903, when it was 14.14 per 1,000. The favourable mortality among infants which had been experienced in the third quarter was not maintained, as it rose from 79 to 140 per 1,000 births, as compared with 129 in the fourth quarter of 1906, and with 141 in the similar periods of the ten years 1897-1906. The rate was the highest since 1902, when it was 150, and was exactly the average of the twenty years 1886-1905, a circumstance of which persons who hold that our infantile mortality rate is declining should note.

The Standard. Death Rate signifies the death rate at all ages calculated on the hypothesis that the rates at each of the twelveage periods in each town were the same as in England and Wales during the ten years 18911901; the death rate at all ages in England and Wales during that period having been 18 19 per 1,000. †The Factor for Correction is the figure by which the Crude or Recorded Death Rate should be multiplied in order to correct for variations of sex and age distribution. ‡The Corrected Death Rate is the Crude or Recorded Death Rate after correction has been made for variations of age and sex distribution, and may be obtained by multiplying the latter by the Factor for Correction. § The Comparative Mortality Figure represents the Corrected Death Rate in each Borough compared with the Recorded Death Rate at all ages in England and Wales in 1907 taken as 1,000. 42. 1907 Table XXVII.

During 1907, the most favourable year within the recollection of the present generation, no less than 996 deaths of infants were registered from various causes. These deaths were in the proportion of 117 to every 1,000 registered births, which numbered 8,531. To find a return approaching this record we must go back fiftyeight years to the middle year of the last century, 1850, when the proportion was 119 per 1,000 births. From that year up to 1894, when the rate was 127 per 1,000 births, it was never below 130, while occasionally it was much higher, as in 1866 it reached 169, and was 160 as recently as 1899. It is a noticeable fact that the two years, 1850 and 1894, when the mortality was so low, were succeeded in the following years by a high mortality, for in 1851 it was 151, and in 1894 it was 139, which was followed in the very next year by so high a rate as 150; then by a rate of 136 in 1897, of 159 in 1898, of 160 in 1899, and of 145 in 1900. Since then the mortality has fallen by easy stages to 117 in the year under consideration. In 1907 the mortality was not equally good in all parts of the borough, for it varied from 88 per 1,000 births in Upper Holloway to 148 per 1,000 births in Lower Holloway. In 1907 the mortality was not equally good in all parts of the borough, for it varied from 88 per 1,000 births in Upper Holloway to 148 per 1,000 births in Lower Holloway. SubDistricts. Deaths.

Granted, for argument's sake, that it has declined, its amount is so insignificant that it is not worthy of remark, for it is at most a reduction of 2.8 per cent. since the years 183945, whereas the rate might have fallen to at least 80 per 1,000 if there had been proper attention and instruction given to mothers about themselves, their surroundings, and their infants. Labour is an operation usually attended without risk to the infant, but owing to the surroundings in which the child is born, it frequently happens that its vitality is sapped at the earliest stage of its existence; its frail constitution is blighted ; and its life, if the child be not killed, is made a burden by disease, which would never have afflicted it if there had been a kindly sympathetic voice to instruct and direct the mother in the duties of motherhood both before and after its birth. Let us examine the subdistrict records for the last six years to see if there is no excessive infant mortality in Islington. SubDistricts. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907. 19027. Tufnell 123 112 141 127 122 127 126 Upper Holloway 103 138 92 101 105 88 103 Tollington 144 105 128 117 127 132 129 Lower Holloway 156 159 161 151 155 148 152 Highbury 114 178 98 117 95 107 109 Barnsbury 151 210 142 124 138 123 135 South East Islington 130 263 134 121 129 104 125 132 126 128 123 125 117 125 Is the average of these rates in any one district during the last six years satisfactory? One cannot think so when the lowest average mortality during six years is 103 per 1,000, while the highest is 152 per 1,000, and is an irrefutable answer to those who say "all is well" to our boasted administration. The district in which this high rate has existed is Lower Holloway, whose population is at least 41,700, and is equal to that of a good sized town, and whose general sanitary state is good. Again, the average infant mortality rate during the last six years of Barnsbury cannot afford satisfaction, for there it 45 1907 has been 135 per 1,000 births; nor of Tollington, where it has been 129, nor yet of Tufnell, where it has been 126. There can be no doubt that these rates are excessive and that therefore something should be done, some endeavour made, by instruction to mothers, to reduce them. The Borough Council in their wisdom, have, however, declined to adopt their Medical Officer of Health's recommendation with respect to the prevention of the excessive infantile mortality in the borough so far as the appointment of trained, qualified, and paid lady health visitors is concerned, and, therefore, the undue mortality among infants must continue unchecked. It is a sad thought, and one to cause serious reflection, that a body of business men could arrive at the conclusion, with the report of the Medical Officer of Health on the Prevention of Infantile Mortality before them, that there was no need for paid health visitors. It has been said by one or at most two members of the Council that if that report had put before them facts and figures, and had not been an appeal to their sentiment, they would have considered them as business men. But surely this statement is incorrect and, therefore, misleading, for the report literally teems with facts and figures respecting the deaths of infants, and traces back nearly all their ailments to their original or most probable causes. As to the sentiment of that report, there is no need for apology, because it is absolutely impossible for any man who has been brought into close contact with the awful ignorance that leads to the piteous, painful, and unnecessary deaths of infants, to write about them without having his feelings moved and his sympathies aroused and without endeavouring to arouse similar feelings and sympathies in the hearts of those who are ignorant of the facts. Indeed, if this were not so, then the following lines, in the slightly altered words of Shakespeare, might be applied, and rightly applied, to the Medical Officer of Health :— The man that hath no feeling in himself, Nor is not moved with needless infant ills, Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils. The motions of his spirit are dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus : Let no such man be trusted. The Medical Officer of Health, therefore, sees no reason to regret his appeal to the sentiment, as well as to the common sense of the Council, although he regrets to find that there are one or two gentlemen who object to it. Doubtless they forget that it is sentiment rules, and has ruled, the kingdoms of this world, and that it is this same feeling which induces all nationalities to be loyal to the flag. Sentiment is the cement which binds families, communities and nations together, who without it would be nomads, each individual a law unto himself and preying on the other. 1907 46 Sentiment in the case of these infants is pity and pity is one of the greatest characteristics of the human being, without which he would be little better than a lesser animal, which, however, is not altogether devoid of it for as Shakespeare has written No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity. The education of mothers with respect to the feeding and the preparation of the food of their infants, if they do not nurse them, is important during the summer quarter of the year. Facing this page is a chart, which shows how heavy is the infantile mortality at that period, from which it will be seen that it rose during the third quarters of the last seven years to 36 per cent, over the general annual average. This high mortality is in a large part due to the food, especially milk, given to children when it is sour and, therefore, absolutely unfit for the use of infants. The fact is that as a rule mothers among the labouring classes have no conception as to how they can keep the food intended for their infants sweet and fit for use, and, therefore, they require to be instructed. On glancing at the chart, one cannot help being struck with the remarkable increase in infantile mortality between the twentyfifth and the thirtysixth weeks of the year, for there we see that from being 34 per cent. below the average at the former week, it is 35 per cent. above it in the latter. Now, if a check could be put to the excessive mortality of the third quarter, and if it could be brought to anything like the mean of the year, an enormous number of lives would be saved. The best way of doing this is to teach mothers to keep their food in cool places and where dust and contamination cannot reach it, and also to instruct them that they must under no circumstances give milk to their babes when once it has turned sour, for therein lurks death. If the mortality could always be as low as in the period graphically depicted on the chart, and extending from the twelfth to the thirtyfirst week, there would be little cause for anxiety as to the waste of infant lives. What is wanted is that mothers should be taught the fact that these lives can be saved if only the proper care is taken of them. The summer of 1907 was particularly favourable to infants, so that its mortality only reached the small figure of 79 per 1,000 births. The cause of this was that it was cool, the earth's temperature was low because its crust was kept moist with rain and dust did not fly about, and the sunshine as recorded in hours was considerably below the average. Nature taught a very salutary lesson, for she, as it were, suggests that if we imitate her in 47 1907 our homes and keep the children's food in cool places and free from dust, then the mortality amongst the little ones will be proportionately small. As the figures on this subject are certain to be required at no distant date, when this matter of infantile mortality again arises for discussion, for it cannot be permanently put aside, they are herewith given for a period extending from 1830 to the present time. nfantile Mortality Returns, extracted from the Annual Reports of tin Registrar General, 18391855, and from the Annual Reports of tin Medical Officer of Health of Islington, 18561907.

Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fevers (that is to say Typhus, Enteric, and Continued), and Diarrhœal Diseases. Deaths.—In his annual report for 1906 the Medical Officer of Health was able to express his satisfaction at the low mortality for the year. He is now able to repeat it, and to congratulate the Borough Council on the fact that the return of 432 is not only below the corrected average of the preceding ten years by as many as 225 deaths, but that it is also the lowest return within that period, and indeed since, and including, 1885. Deathrate.—These 432 deaths represent a mortality rate of 1.24 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with a mean rate of 1.89 per 1,000 in the decennium 1897.1906, during which the lowest epidemic death.rate chronicled was 1.39 per 1,000, in 1903. The mortality from these diseases for some years past has exhibited a general tendency to decrease, especially since 1896, from which year to now it has fallen almost steadily, although there have been same slight fluctuations, which, however, only accentuate the general declination. These statements are based on the figures set out in Table XXX, which shows the mortality from each of those diseases from 1885 to the end of 1907. A strong feature of the present returns is that the decrease in the mortality, as compared with the decennial averages, is not confined to any one, two, or more diseases, but is common to all. Thus Small Pox shows a decrease of 6, Measles 35, Scarlet Fever 12, Diphtheria 43, Whooping Cough 9, Enteric Fever 22, Simple Continued Fever 1, and Diarrhoeal diseases 97. 1907 54 Table XXX.

No death from this disease was registered in the borough. MEASLES. The deaths from measles numbered 130, and were in the proportion of 038 to every 1,000 persons living in the borough. These deaths, while GO below the corrected average for twenty years, are 57 below the returns for the preceding year. There has been no great outbreak of this disease in Islington since 1898, when 325 deaths were recorded, prior to which the most serious epidemics prevailed in 1887, when the fatal cases numbered 335, and in 1898, when they numbered 325. The records of measles are very interesting and the Medical Officer of Health with considerable trouble has collected the returns since 1851, which are herewith printed, in order to contrast them with those of the present day and also to preserve them.

These returns would have been more correct if their basis had been the number of children living at those ages at which the disease is most prevalent, but as the material was not available, the above calculations must suffice. They are, however, ample for the writer's purpose, as tdey undoubtedly show that, despite the large number of children who attend our elementary schools, the disease is less fatal, and probably proportionally less prevalent, than it was in those early years, when school attendance was not compulsory, as it now is. At the beginning of the year there were comparatively few cases of measles known in the borough, and, indeed, only three deaths were chronicled in the first three months; but as the year advanced the number rapidly increased so that the known cases, which were nearly all reported by the L.C.C. school teachers, in the second quarter had leaped from 380, with 4 deaths, in the first, to 979, with 56 deaths, while in the third quarter the known cases numbered 249*, but the deaths were 44; and in the fourth quarter 26 deaths were registered and 460 cases were recorded. During the past twenty-six years Measies has usually been less fatal in the third quarter than at any period of the year; then the deaths have increased in the fourth quarter, and continued to do so in the first quarter of the succeeding year, until the disease reached its maximum in the second quarter. Thus in these years there have been 1,130 deaths, or 30.7 per cent. in the first quarter; 1,366, or 37.1 per cent. in the second quarter; 510, or 13.9 per cent. in the third quarter, and 674, or 18.31 per cent. in the fourth quarter. Of course there have been variations to this apparent rule in several years, for instance, in 1898 the greatest number of deaths occurred in the first quarter, in 1895 in the third quarter, and in 1901 in the fourth quarter, but as a rule the fatal incidence of measles is as stated. * The decrease was due to the closure of the schools for the summer holidays. 65 [1907 Owing to the prevalence of Measles among the scholars, class-rooms in the following schools were closed and disinfected. 1st Quarter. Gifford Street L.C.C School. 2nd Quarter. Blackstock Road L.C.C. School. 3rd Quarter. Ecclesbourne Road L.C.C. School. 4th Quarter. Arlington Square L.C.C. School. St. John's Schools (Upper Holloway). Whittington L.C.C. School. Canonbury Road L.C.C. School. The Ages at Death from Measles:—Of the 130 deaths, all, with the exception of 4 were among children under 5 years of age, 27 of whom had not reached the end of their first year of life. An examination of the returns shows that the disease was not equally fatal to infants under a year old in each quarter. Thus in the first 50 per cent. were infants, in the second 14 per cent., in the third 25 per cent., and in the fourth 23 per cent. The numbers analysed here being only for one year, the Medical Officer of Health has examined the returns for the several quarters during the ten years 1898-1907, which embraced 1,645 deaths from Measles, and has extracted the following figures from them:— Infant Deaths. All Deaths. ntage of Infant Deaths. 1st Quarter 117 530 22.0 2nd „ 131 568 23.1 3rd „ 64 251 25.5 4th „ 53 296 17.9 Totals 365 1,645 22.2 These results completely alter the figures as shown when only a single year was taken, and thereby show the fallacy, when dealing with vital statistics, of basing any conclusions on the results of so short a period and on small numbers. Here we see that the most fatal period for very young children attacked with measles is the third quarter of the year, or at the season when the weather is warm and bright. It is hard to explain this circumstance, because as a rule pneumonia and bronchitis, two of the secondary causes of death in measles, are least fatal to them in this quarter. It would be interesting to inquire into the cause, but it is impossible, just now at all events, to pursue the subject further. 1907] 66 Additional particulars, as to the deaths in the sub-districts and in the quarters are given in Tables XXXVII. and XXXVIII.

Only 24 deaths, or 60 below the corrected average of the preceding ten years, were registered from Scarlet Fever in 1907, which, taking the increased population, is the smallest number hitherto registered in the borough. It is true that in 1900 and again in 1903 the same number of deaths obtained, but these would represent about 25 in the estimated population of last year. The return is also 13 below that of the preceding year, and 26 less than the corrected average of the preceding twenty-one years. The record for these years is interesting. During the five years 1886-90 the number of deaths averaged 51; in the succeeding five years, 1891-5, the number rose to 66 per annum; in the next quinquennial period 1896-1900 they averaged 40; while in the quinquennium 1901-5 the average fell to 33; and in the two following years 1906 and 1907, they numbered respectively 37 and 24. Thus we see that there has been a steady decline in the mortality since the end of the quinquennium 1891-95. 1907] 70 It is a suggestive fact that, as increased hospital isolation was afforded to this disease, so did its mortality and its fatality decrease. As this subject is fully discussed under the heading of "Isolation of Infectious Diseases in Hospital," no further reference will be made to it now. Table XLIII.

The deaths are also in excess of the records of 1905, when 34 occurred, and of 1904, when there were 28. They are, however far below the returns of the year prior to 1903, when it was no unusual circumstance for them to number 100 and upwards. The figures for quinquennial periods since 1881 are as follows:— Deaths. Average number per annum. 1881-85 418 83 1886-90 311 62 1891-95 842 168 1896-1900 678 135 1901-05 343 68 It is plain from these figures that we are returning to the state of affairs that existed in Islington in the second half of the last century, down to 1880, the figures of which for each year, have been compiled by the Medical Officer of Health, and are now given in quinquennial periods. Deaths. Average number per annum. 1861-65 194 39 1865-70 137 27 1871-75 115 23 1876-80 165 33 During the five years 1903 to 1907, the deaths in Islington numbered 163, or nearly 33 per annum, so that they are almost identical with those that obtained thirty years ago, and when the increase in the population is taken into account, are even better. In those former days Diphtheria, which was always a very fatal disease, was considered to be one whose habitat was essentially rural. It seemed to shun towns and populous places. Later on its habit changed, and it became more prevalent in them than in country places, so that at present its mortality in urban counties is 245 per million, as against 173 in the rural counties. So far as Islington is concerned, there has been not only a decrease in the number of deaths during the last few years, but also in the number of cases, which in the five years 1891-5 reached to 3,669; in the next five years, 1896-1900, 3,610 ; and in the five years 1901-05 2,923. Thus there has been a decrease of 687 cases, or 135 per annum, between the totals of the two last 1907] 72 quinquennial periods. In the former period the cases averaged 722 annually, and in the latter 585, but in 1906 and 1907 they respectively numbered 4.37 and 486, so that the decrease has been maintained. It is not easy to say how far the prevalence of the disease in the present time compares with that of the past, because formerly the fatality among those attacked was very high, while latterly it has been comparatively low, owing to the introduction of the serum treatment, so that any exact comparison is impossible. It may be stated, however, that formerly about 25 per cent. of the persons attacked died, whereas during the last two years, in Islington only 8½ per cent. succumbed. We can, however, arrive at an estimate, if we calculate that the mortality represented 25 per cent. of the cases in the quinquennium 1861-65, consequently the 194 deaths in that period would represent 776 cases, as against 2,923 in the five years 1901 05. The population has, however, more than doubled since then, so that a correction must be made for the increase, and consequently the 776 would become 1,575, so that probably a truer contrast would be 1,575 as against 2,923. Thus, however we consider the question, there has been an enormous increase in the prevalence of Diphtheria since the middle of the last century, although just now there are, as we have seen, strong indications of a marked decrease.

Whooping cough, although causing 44 fewer deaths than the average of the twenty years 1885-1906, was nevertheless more fatally prevalent than in the previous three years, having caused 120 deaths, as compared with 74 in 1906, 111 in 1905, and 83 in 1904, with a resulting death-rate of 0.34 per 1,000 of the population. In proportion to their populations, the disease was most prevalent in the sub-districts of Lower Holloway and Barnsbury, and least prevalent in Tollington and South-East Islington. It is also to be noted that, of the 120 deaths, no less than 100 occurred in the first six months of the year. Table XLVII.

For the fifth successive year, a low mortality from enteric fever has to be chronicled, for the deaths numbered only 13, or 28 below the corrected average of the preceding twenty years, which is not only relatively, but actually the smallest number hitherto recorded in Islington since civil registration was adopted. These deaths represent a death-rate of 0.04 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with a rate of 010 in the preceding ten years.

No death was recorded during the year, which was the eighth in succession in which there has been none. In the last twenty-three years only 12 deaths altogether have been registered, and these were distributed among eight years, thus leaving Islington for fifteen years absolutely free from the disease. Vide Table XXX. for a statement of the mortality since 1885. CONTINUED FEVER. Nil return. DIARRHœL DISEASES. In twenty-two years there have been only two years in which the number of deaths directly ascribed to diarrhoea were so few as in 1907, when they numbered only 103, or Less than half the number registered in 1906, and exactly half that of 1905. it is also GO below the corrected average of the ten years G 1907] 76 1897-06. The number of deaths from other diarrhœal diseases, such as Epidemic Enteritis was 102, thus making a total of 205 deaths from these diseases. These satisfactory returns are due entirely to the favourable meteorological conditions that prevailed during the third quarter, for in the first quarter of the year diarrhœal deaths were 4 above the corrected average of the corresponding quarters of the preceding ten years; in the second quarter they were 6 above it; and in the fourth they were 26. The reduced mortality is highly gratifying, particularly as it is almost entirely among infants that these deaths occur. The deaths recorded in each quarter were as follows Diarrhoea.

Each one of these meteorological items in itself tended to check fermentive action, and therefore had a restraining effect on diarrhoea, the germ of which is most certainly influenced by heat, especially by the heat of the earth's crust. 77 [1907 Table LI.

Once more there was a considerable number of deaths from influenza, 75 in all, which is 2 more than the corrected average of the preceding ten years ; the return is also only 2 above that for 1906, and 8 above that for 1905. It was most fatal in the early part of the year, when, during the first quarter, it caused 48 deaths, which was 10 more than the average of the preceding decade for that period of the year. In the second quarter the deaths fell to 12, or 2 less than the similar decennial average; and in the third quarter to 4, which was exactly equal to the decennial average, but the number rose again to 11 in the fourth quarter, although the deaths were still below the decennial average.

As many as 19 deaths, of which 10 were among males and 9 among females, were due to appendicitis, a complaint of which one heard very little until within the last few years, particularly since 1901, previous to which date it was usually referred to Enteritis. It is not a very fatal ailment and is very amenable to treatment, except where there are complications. During the last six years the mortality in England has averaged 63 in every million males, and 41 in every million females. The deaths locally during the last six years have been:— 1902 21 1905 29 1903 8 1906 20 1904 28 1907 19 87 [1907 The subsequent tabular statement has been prepared to show the ages at which people died from the disease.

These diseases, which include, among others, Erysipelas, Pyaemia, Septicemia and Puerperal Fever, caused 52 deaths. Erysipelas was responsible for 13 deaths, or 1 less than the corrected average of ten years. It was fatal to 3 children under a year old, while of the remaining number 2 were between 1 and 5 years, and 8 were over five years. Table LXI.

In this group are included Cancer, Tuberculous Diseases, Rheumatic Fever, Rheumatism, Rickets, Diabetes, Gout and some other diseases as set out in table LXIX. Cancer and other Malignant Diseases.—There were 348 deaths, of which 177 were those of males, and 171 of females, registered in the Borough during the year. This number, although 15 less than that registered in 1906, is 50 above the corrected average of the preceding 16 years, and is equal to an annual death rate of 10.02 in every 10,000 of our inhabitants. In the statement that is given below, which shows the deaths since 1891, it will be perceived that they increased gradually but steadily from that year to now, subject at times to a certain ebb, but, like the waves of the flood tide on the seashore, ever advancing. Science has of late years been very busy in endeavouring to discover some cure or some preventive of what has undoubtedly become a very serious scourge to our race, but up to now no preventive nor cure of any recognised value has been discovered. In Islington, among persons below 25 years of age the rate was only 0.41 per 10,000 of the inhabitants; in the next ten years (25-35) however, it doubled itself (0.95), while in the succeeding ten years, viz., 35 to 45, it was more than nine times the rate it was in the preceding 10 years (8.63). In the next period, 45 to 55, the death-rate was more than double that of the preceding one (19.83), while in the succeeding ten years of age (55 to 65) the mortality rate was nearly two-and-a-half times as large as that last mentioned, and was 45-37. Between 65 and 75 the mortality rate was again more than double that of the preceding age period, so that it amounted to 95.90 per 10,000; and from 75 years old upwards there was a slight diminution, as the rate fell to 81.30 per 10,000. (Vide Table LXV.) Males and females are almost equally subject to the disease, for it is found that during the year the death rate among males was 10.72 per 10,000 male inhabitants, and among females 9.39 per 10,000 female inhabitants. Such a mortality as this naturally causes very great anxiety among thoughtful persons, whether professional or merely inquirers after truth, and chiefly because it is not exactly known in what way the disease is propagated, and when propagated how it may be cured. 91 [1907 The record for Islington, to which allusion was made above, is as follows :— Years Deaths Deaths per 10,000 Pop.

Phthsis.—The returns show that there were 436 deaths registered in the Borough in 1907, as compared with a corrected average of 537 in the preceding 13 years, or a decrease of 101. These deaths represent a death rate of 1.26 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, as compared with 1.55 in the years mentioned. They also represent 8.58 per cent. of the deaths from all causes registered during the year. These are serious figures, although it must be acknowledged that they have shown a gradual improvement since 1900, when the deaths numbered 602 and the death rate from Phthisis was 1.79 per 1,000 inhabitants.

Of these deaths, 11 were those of males and 15 of females; 17 of the deceased were under a year old, seven between 1 and 5 years, and two were over the latter age. Tubercular Meningitis and Hydrocephalus were the registered cause of 74 deaths, of which 33 were among males and 41 among females. With the exception of 19, all were of children under 5 years old. Tuberculosis of the Larynx caused the deaths of six persons, all of whom were over 5 years of age. Curiously enough, all were males. General Tuberculosis or Scrofula was responsible for 50 deaths, 27 of which were of children under 5 years of age; while 27 were of males and 23 of females. These deaths were in the proportion of 0.14 per 1,000 of the population. Other forms of Tuberculosis caused 16 deaths, 4 of which were of infants under 1 year old, and 12 of persons above 5 years of age. 97 [1907 Table LXVIII.

These diseases include Acute and Chronic Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy, and Asthma, and altogether caused 1,136 deaths, or 22 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, and represent a death rate of 3.27 per thousand of the population. Bronchitis, Acute, caused 198 deaths, of which 83 were those of infants under 12 months old, and were equal to a death rate of 0.57 per 1,000 of the persons living in the Borough. Bronchitis, Chronic. -The returns give 306 deaths, of which 127 were males and 179 were females, and were equal to a death rate of 0.88 per 1,000 of the population. Pneumonia.—To this cause were ascribed 557 deaths, 296 being those of males and 261 of females, and 153 being of infants under a year old, a circumstance which, as has been frequently pointed out in former reports, causes serious misgivings as to the care with which the little ones are tended, because as they cannot expose themselves to atmospheric influences, so frequently the originating cause of this ailment, they must have been exposed by those in charge of them. Of course, it is not intended to infer that even the best cared for do not at times contract pneumonia, nevertheless, when one finds such a large number dying annually from a cause which is more or less preventable, one naturally wants to know how so many deaths have arisen, and becomes suspicious that they had occurred through neglect of some kind or through ignorance. Pleurisy caused 26 deaths, of which 12 were those of males and 14 of females. Asthma was the ascribed cause of 24 deaths, 15 males and 9 females. Other Diseases of Respiration.—To these were ascribed the deaths of 25 persons, of whom 8 were males and 17 females. Deaths of Infants under a year old :— Acute Bronchitis. Pneumonia.

Of these persons, 4 died from it in its acute form, three being males and one a female, while from its chronic form 7 males and 17 female; perished. Thus we find that more females than males, 18 as against 10, died from the disease. It is probable, however, that the registration of the cause of death is not always correct in the case of the males, as no doubt the disease gets cloaked under the heading of other diseases which alcohol has set up. Apart from the diseases of the liver and kidneys, which are frequently due to alcohol, other diseases are also induced. Thus Cancer of the Œsophagus, and of the stomach, not infrequently arise from it. Cerebral thrombosis is not an uncommon result, and that there is an epilepsy which is developed as a result of chronic alcoholism, is beyond all doubt. Gastric Catarrh is of course a very general result, while haematuria is not uncommon ; the hearing too is sometimes affected, while conception during a state of drunkenness or of chronic alcoholism, frequently gives rise to congenital deafness in the children. Mental disease repeatedly arises and nervous disease is all too frequent. Alcohol also often affects the embryo child by injuring the condition of pregnancy; so here we see that alcoholism gives rise to other diseases. A German writer recently remarked that among the causes of accidents, the influence of holidays and Sundays must not be under-estimated, and is most marked in the building trade, where a large number occur on Monday, and the chief factor at work in this is alcohol. How far this obtains in England the writer cannot state, as he does not recollect at the moment any discussion of the subject, but there can be no doubt that the nervous condition of men after a bout of drinking on Saturday and Sunday would render the drinkers more liable to an accident than at any other time. The number of deaths during each year since 1901 is as follows:— Acute. Chronic. Total Males. Females. 1901 27 27 7 20 1902 9 29 38 20 18 1903 3 23 26 13 13 1904 4 18 22 12 10 1905 4 21 25 9 16 1906 3 13 16 5 11 1907 4 24 28 10 18 Totals 182 76 106 101 [1907 VENEREAL DISEASES. Syphilis and Gonorrhoea between them were responsible for the death of 16 persons, of whom 12 were males and 4 were females. Among these deaths were included those of 5 children under a year old ; but none between the ages of 1 and 5, while the remaining deaths were those of adults. The following are the particulars of the deaths from these diseases during the 7 years ending 1907. Under 1 year. 1—5 years. Adults.

The actual number of deaths in the public institutions of Islington amounted to 1,675, of which, however, 593 were those of persons who had come to Islington for treatment, and, therefore, are not included in the mortality returns of the Borough. This return is the largest that has hitherto been known, and is 178 more than the average of the preceding 10 years. There were in addition 656 persons, citizens of the Borough, who died in Institutions outside the Borough, so that the gross number of deaths of all persons in Institutions within the Borough and of Islingtonians outside the Borough was 2,331. Within the Borough.—The number of deaths in local Institutions numbered 1,675, of which 1,082 were those of inhabitants, the remaining 593 being of persons brought hither for treatment either in the Holborn Infirmary 1907] 102 or in some other local institution such as the Great Northern Hospital. In the former institution 391 strangers died, and in the latter 105. The other institutions in which the deaths of strangers occurred are set out in Table LXXI. Inhabitants.—Of the 1,082 citizens who died in the local hospitals and homes, 760 deaths took place in the Islington Infirmary, 151 in the Islington Workhouse, 130 in the Great Northern Hospital, 4 in the Memorial Cottage Hospital, and 4 in the Aged Blind Home. The other deaths occurred in some of the smaller institutions of the Borough. Noil-inhabitants.— In addition to the 105 persons who died in the Great Northern Hospital, and the 391 who died in the Holborn Infirmary, 9 died in the London Fever Hospital, 8 in the Memorial Cottage Hospital, 19 in St. Pelagia's Creche, 5 in the Metropolitan Benefit Society's Asylum, 7 in the Aged Blind Home, 2 at the Whittington College, 6 at St. Andrew's Nursing Home, 2 at the Invalid Home, Highbury Terrace, and 1 in the Shoreditch Workhouse, an institution recently established in Islington. (See Table LXXI.) Without the Borough.—656 persons belonging to Islington died in outside institutions, or 48 more than the average of the preceding 10 years. Of these deaths 94 occurred in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 57 in the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, 46 in University College Hospital, 40 in the Royal Free Hospital, 33 in the Middlesex Hospital, 31 in the North Western Fever Hospital, 29 in the Metropolitan Hospital, 24 in the North Eastern Fever Hospital, and 23 in the Claybury Asylum. The remaining deaths occurred in other institutions as set out in Table LXXIII. Within and Without the Borough.—Altogether 1,738 inhabitants of Islington, as compared with an average of 1,524 in the preceding 10 years, died in public or charitable institutions situate within or without the Borough. Accidental and sudden deaths without the Borough. - In addition to the above deaths, there occurred outside the Borough 29 accidental or sudden deaths of Islingtonians, which are set out at the end of Table LXXIII. 103 [1907 Table LXX.

He was also instructed to say that with a view to providing suitable accommodation for this purpose in Islington, arrangements had been made for the Mortuary in Holloway Road to be placed at the disposal of undertakers who found it necessary to take charge of dead bodies prior to the day of burial, and to add that the Public Health Committee trusted that their efforts in this direction would result in the abandonment by undertakers of the present practice. Accordingly, on the 7th March a circular was addressed to the above effect to every undertaker in the Borough. It is with regret that it is to be reported that none of them has seen nt to take advantage of this offer. No doubt, nothing will be done until legislation gives power to the sanitary authority to prevent bodies being kept on undertakers' premises while awaiting burial and elsewhere than in a Mortuary. PART III THE NOTIFICATION, ISOLATION, FATALITY, AND PREVENTION OF DISEASE. INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN THE PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND ON BUSINESS PREMISES, TOGETHER WITH THE OCCUPATIONS OF THE PERSONS ATTACKED. 1907] 112 THE NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Enteric or Typhoid Fever, Erysipelas, Continued Fever, Relapsing Fever, and Cholera. These are the infectious diseases which medical practitioners and parents and guardians, or those having charge of patients, are compelled to notify to the sanitary authority of Islington under the provisions of section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. During the year 2,064 cases of these diseases were notified, or 438 less than the average, after correction had been made for the increase of population, of the preceding ten years. The return is also 228 below the return for 1900 The decrease in the notified cases is not confined to one or two diseases, but is common to all, and therefore it is that the return is so satisfactory. In proportion to population, the cases were 1.27 per 1,000 below the average, the attack rate being 5.94, as against a decennial rate or T.21 per 1,000 inhabitants. Years Cases. Attack-rates. 1891 - - 2,059 = 6.43 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1892 - - 3,318 = 10.26 ,, ,, 1893 - - 4,853 = 14.84 ,, ,, 1894 - - 3,121 = 9.44 ,, ,, 1895 - - 2,839 = 8.50 ,, ,, 1896 - - 3,824 = 11.32 ,, „ 1897 - - 2,906 = 8.62 ,, ,, 1898 - - 2,418 = 7.18 ,, ,, 1899 - - 2,943 = 8.75 ,, ,, 1900 - - 2,276 = 6.78 ,, ,, 1901 - - 2,852 = 8.50 ,, ,, 1902 - - 3,164 = 9.20 „ „ 1903 - - 1,707 = 5.03 ,, ,, 1904 - - 1,941 = 5.69 ,, ,, 1905 - - 1,928 = 5.62 ,, „ 1906 - - 2,275 = 6.59 ,, ,, 1907 - - 2,063 = 5.94 ,, ,, 113 [1907 The attack-rate compares very favourably with the record of other places, for it was not only below the rate for the County of London, but also below that of any of the six boroughs which surround Islington, with the exception of Hornsey.

The return is also satisfactory because in no part of the borough was the incidence of these diseases excessive, as may be judged by the following statements respecting the sub-registration districts and the wards. Sub-Registration Districts.—The infectious diseases were distributed in the sub-registration districts as follows:— Cases. Attack-rates. Tufnell 193 5.60 Upper Holloway 178 4.88 Tollington 163 4.48 Lower Holloway 269 6.44 Highbury 387 5.72 Barnsbury 366 6.79 Islington South East 507 6.62 Total 2,063 5.94 1907] 114 In the Wards the cases notified and their proportion to the population were as follows:— ] Cases.

In the same quarter the attack rate in London was 6.47 per 1,000, while in the boroughs surrounding Islington it was 6.27 per 1,000. In the second quarter 450 cases were known, equal to an annual attack rate of 5.19 per 1,000, and 77 below the average (527) of the second quarters of the preceding ten years. In London the attack rate was 7.01 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, or l.82 higher than in Islington, while the rate in the encircling boroughs was exactly the same as in London. In the third quarter the total number of cases notified was 516, which produced an annual attack rate of 5.95 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, and they were 149 below the corrected average (665) which obtained in the third quarters of the preceding ten years. In London, in the same quarter, the attack rate was 9.23 per 1,000, or 3.28 higher than Islington, while in the encircling boroughs it was 8 91, or 2.96 higher than the local rate. 115 In the fourth quarter 666 cases were notified, representing an annual attack rate of 7.68 per 1,000 of the population. They were 107 below the corrected average (773) of the fourth quarters of the ten years 1897.1906. The attack rate in London in the same period was 11.46 per 1,000, or 3.78 higher than in Islington, while in the encircling boroughs it was 12.41 per 1,000, or 4.73 higher than the rate of Islington. Fatality.—By this term, when used in this Report, is meant the percentage of deaths to cases of notifiable infectious diseases. It is the means of estimating the virulence of the disease. During 1907, as we have seen, there were 2,063 cases of infectious disease notified, of which 100 resulted in death, so that the fatality was at the rate of 4.8 per cent., which is the lowest rate that has hitherto been known in Islington. In 1906 it was 5 per cent, having fallen from 5.5 in 1905. In the statement given below it will be seen that in 1891 the figure was as high as 12.5 per cent., in 1894 10 8 per cent., and in 1896 10.2 per cent. It will be noticed also that since 1891 the tendency of the fatality has been to decline. Years. Cases. Deaths.

It is very satisfactory to note that no case of Small pox was notified in the borough during the year. This is the first time since 1898 that this has occurred. In the County of London only 8 cases were known, so that the metropolis may congratulate itself on its freedom from this terrible scourge. In the encircling boroughs, two cases were notified, one in St. Pancras, and one in Shoreditch. SCARLET FEVER. There were 1,216 cases notified, as against an average of l,305 in the preceding ten years, and they represented an attack rate of 3.50 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with a decennial rate of 3.26. In London the rate was 545 per 1,000, and in the encircling boroughs 5.54 per 1,000. In the first three quarters of the year the disease behaved much as usual in Islington, running more or less on the lines of the averages of the corresponding weeks during the preceding ten years. The weekly curves were, however, somewhat more irregular, jumping about from such figures as 15 to 30, 16 to 25, 15 to 25, 10 to 18, 12 to 27, 14 to 30, and so on. As a rule, the maximum number of cases is reached in the first week of the fourth quarter. This, however, was not the case in the year under consideration, the maximum not being attained until the last week of October., when 49 cases, or 4 more than the average maximum of the preceding ten years, were notified. Afterwards there was a very sharp decline in the number of the notifications, which continued to the end of the year. Hospital Isolation.—As many as 112, or 94.4 per cent of the cases were removed to hospital. This percentage is without precedent, and speaks largely as to the great use that is made of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's hospitals in isolating this disease. (See also p. 150.) Fatality.—Among 1,216 cases, 24 deaths, or 1.9 per cent., occurred, which with the percentage obtained in 1898 is the lowest on record. In 1906 it was 2.7, in 1905 3.1, while in the 10 years 1891-1900 it was 3.3. 117 [1907 Table LXXV. Showing the Sickness from Scarlet Fever in the Sub-Districts for each Quarter and for the Year.

Diphtheria, inclusive of Membranous Croup, was notified in 481 instances, as compared with a decennial average of 614. The attack rate was equal to 1.39 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with one of 1.77 in the 10 years 1897-1906. In London the rate was 1.84 and in the Encircling Boroughs r8o per 1,000 inhabitants. Hospital Isolation.—It is again satisfactory to note that patients suffering from this disease were largely isolated, as many as 404 cases, or 8.40 per cent., having been removed to hospital for treatment and isolation. Fatality.—42 deaths occured among the 481 cases that were notified, so that 8.7 per cent. of the patients died. This proportion is slightly higher than in 1907, when it was 7.3, the lowest rate on record in Islington, but nevertheless it appears very favourable when contrasted with the rates that obtained in the 10 years 1891.1900, when the fatality averaged 21.5 per cent. of the cases. In 1901 it was 14.7 per cent.; in 1902 11.8; in 1903 it fell to 9.4; in 1904 it was only 8.1; in 1905 9.7 and 1906 Thus we see that there has been an almost 119 [1907 continuous diminution in the fatality from this disease, which at one time was undoubtedly one of the most virulent with which the medical profession had to cone.

To this fever 99 cases, the smallest number hitherto notified in a year, were ascribed as compared with an average of 2.20 in the preceding decennium. Such a decrease, amounting to 68 per cent., is very satisfactory. These cases were equal to an attack rate of 0.26 per 1,000 as compared with one of 0.64 in the 10 years 1897-1906. In London the rate was 0.29 per 1,000 inhabitants, and in the Encircling Boroughs 0.30. Hospital Isolation. 77 cases, or 83.7 per cent., were removed to hospital for treatment and isolation. Fatality.—13 deaths occurred among the 92 cases, and the fatality rate was therefore 14.1 per cent., which, with the exception of the rate of the preceding year, when it was 12.7, is the lowest of which there is a record in Islington.

No case of this disease was notified, and, indeed, during the last 17 years only 16 cases altogether were known, of which 4 occurred since 1001. In London only 5 cases occurred. ERYSIPELAS. This disease was reported as attacking 252 persons, which contrasts very favourable with the average of 207 in the years 1807-1006. The attack rate was equal to 0.73 per thousand of the inhabitants, as compared with a rate of 0.86 that obtained in the previous 10 years. In the Metropolis the rate was 0.04, and in the Encircling Boroughs 0.96 per 1,000 inhabitants. Hospital Isolation.—Forty-eight cases, or 19.1 per cent., were treated in hospital, whither they had generally gone in the first instance for treatment, and whence they had been notified. Fatality.—As there were only 13 deaths among the 252 cases, the tatality was only 5.1 per cent. This rate is slightly lower than that of the preceding years, when it was 5.8. Table LXXXVII.

Twenty-one cases were notified, and were in the proportion of 2.46 per 1,000 women who had borne children during the year. The cases were 4 less than the average of the preceding 10 years, while the attack rate was 0.09 lower than the mean rate that obtained in the 10 years 1897-1906. In London the proportion of cases to parturient women was 2.09 per 1,000, and in the Encircling Districts 1.54. Hospital Isolation.—Only 10 cases were nursed in hospital, or 47.6 per cent. of the entire number. Fatality.—The fatality from this disease is truly dreadful, as out of 21 cases 8 died, or 38.1 per cent. As showing how fatal the disease is, and how necessary it is for women to adopt cleanliness in their persons, in their surroundings, and especially in their bedding and clothing, it may be remarked that during the last 17 years the percentage of deaths has never fallen below 25, while it has been as high as 54.5, and has averaged 404.

L 2 1907 142 EPIDEMIC CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS. Owing to the large number of cases and deaths from this disease, which is also known as Cerebro-Sprnal Fever, in Belfast and in Glasgow towards the end of 1906 and the beginning of 1907, the question of its notification was brought under the notice of the Public Health Committee by the Medical Officer of Health, who in a report explained that it is more usually found among children under 10 years of age, and after childhood among those approaching the age of puberty or of early adult life; and that it is seldom met with after the age of 35 years and is very rare after 40. Also that it is caused by bacteria, which, however, have not been absolutely identified, but that they are generally thought to be the Diplococci intracellularis meningitidis of Weichselbaum, although it is by no means certain that all epidemics are due to them. Further that at such times the disease usually occurs in isolated localities and has not hitherto seemed to extend from one district to the adjacent districts ; and that it is widely distributed in the temperate zone and prevails more in cold weather than in hot. In Ireland, where it has been more prevalent than in any other part of he Kingdom, it has usually prevailed in winter and early spring. Some observers assert that it is neither contagious nor infectious, but however true this may be one thing alone is certain, namely, that its ordinary methods of propagation are unknown. It has not been trnced to food or water supply, although it has been suggested that it owes its origin to the use of breadstuffs made from diseased grain. There is, however, no proof that such is the case. As the disease was not notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Public Health Committee, on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health, addressed a communication to the London County Council requesting them to consider the advisability of adding the disease to the list of those already notifiable under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and stating that in view of the fact that so little is known about it, especially as to its origin and method of spreading, they were of opinion that the notification of all cases that occurred in London would enable a collective inquiry to be made, and that probably much valuable information might be obtained. The result of this action was that a letter, dated the 4th March, 1907, was received from the London County Council, intimating that they had made an 143 1907 Order, dated 26th February, 1907, requiring the notification ot cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever for a period of six months, and that such an Order had been approved by the Local Government Board. At the expiry of this period the Order was extended for a further period of eighteen months. Under the provisions of these Orders, 11 cases, of which 10 were genuine, were notified during the last nine months of the year, and of these 6 died. Cases. Deaths. 1st quarter - — - — 2nd „ 3 - 1 3rd 5 - 5 4th 3 - — THE VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION OF PHTHISIS. The voluntary notification of Phthisis, which has been practised in Islington since January 1st, 1905, has resulted in the following cases having been notified to the Medical Officer of Health :—In 1905, 81; 1906, 64; 1907, 68. These, however, can represent only a small proportion of the cases that must have occurred. The Relieving Officers have given intimation of cases coming under their notice, so that in addition to the 68 cases in 1907 that were notified by Medical Practitioners, information respecting 69 was also obtained. The figures relative to the notification of this disease for the last three years stand as follows:— as follows:— Years. Medical Practitioners. Relieving Officers. Totals Private Practice. Public Practice. 1905 - 68 13 42 123 1906 - 30 34 62 126 1907 - 40 28 69 137 Three years 138 75 173 386 1907 144 Thus we see that in three years only 138 cases have been reported as occurring in private practice, 75 cases in public practice, and 173 by the relieving officers, or a total of 386 cases. Now in the same three years there were 1,285 deaths, and if there were one death for every 10 cases then there must have been 12,850 cases in the Borough in these years, which would point to the fact that information was received in only 3 per cent. of them. In all the cases of which the Public Health Department had cognizance, instructions as to precautions to be taken were left with the people in charge of the patient, or with the patient himself if an adnlt; and when he was removed to an hospital an offer to disinfect the room or rooms lately occupied by him was made to the head of the family or to the responsible person. Where death had supervened on illness, which was learned from the weekly death returns, a letter was addressed to the head of the household offering to disinfect the clothing and the rooms lately occupied by the deceased. This offer has been much appreciated, and has been accepted in many cases, but not in all. Altogether 411 rooms in 296 houses have been disinfected. Houses.

Apart from any other reason these disinfections do good by bringing home to people the fact that phthi is is a communicable disease against which precautions can be taken to prevent its spread. 145 [1907 INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN THE PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. On inquiry into the several cases of infectious disease, it was found that, of the children who had been attacked, 836 were scholars attending the Public Elementary Schools, as compared with 998 in 1906, and an average of 970 in the preceding 10 years. The proportion of patients attending the schools to the total number of cases was 13.9 per cent. The return shows that Scarlet Fever was responsible for 608 cases among scholars, Diphtheria for '216, Enteric Fever for 11, and other notifiable diseases for 1. A return has been prepared showing the number of scholars attacked with each disease during the preceding 10 years. It is as follows:— Table CV. Infectious Diseases in the Public Elementary Schools.

As a rule, these children are only kept at home for a week, because a very large proportion of the patients were removed to hospital for treatment as soon as the case had been notified, and, therefore, there was no occasion to detain them beyond the period within which the incubation of the disease might have been expected. Scarlet Fever.—608 children were attacked, as against an average of 649 during the previous 10 years, while 2,046 children were detained at home until such time as it was safe to allow them to return, and until the premises had been disinfected. For the most part, this period lasted only a week, but in the case of those children whose parents would not allow them to be sent to hospital, the other inmates of the house were debarred school attendance until the patient had been cured and the premises had been disinfected. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—216 cases occurred amongst the scholars, as compared with 177 in the preceding year, and a decennial average of 255. The presence of this disease in the household entailed the absence of 819 children from school for the period of time mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Enteric Fever.—Only 11 cases of this disease were known among scholars, which is the smallest number hitherto recorded. These compared with 33 cases in 1906, and an average of 47 in the 10 years 1897-1906. 122 children were prevented attending school in consequence of its presence in their homes, but on the cases being removed to hospital and the premises being disinfected, they were allowed to resume their studies. 147 [1907 Table CVI.

It is satisfactory once more to note that the number of cases of nonnotifiable infectious diseases occurring among scholars notified by teachers of the public elementary schools show a decided increase, for they numbered 5,829, as compared with 4,135 in 1906. It was mentioned in last year's report, and it may be repeated here, for it is a very important matter, that from 1891 to 1898 no returns, or very few, were received by the Medical Officer of Health from the school teachers. In 1899, owing to very strong and repeated representations, 829 cases were notified. Then in the following year the number rose to 3,066, varying slightly from year to year, but with a tendency to increase until it has reached the high number that has just been indicated. The figures for each of the years are as follows:— 1899 829 1903 2,298 1900 3,066 1904 2,425 1901 3,395 i905 3,397 1902 2,307 1906 4,135 1907 5,829. The cases of disease notified during the year were Measles 2,065, Chicken Pox 981, Whooping Cough 831, and other diseases 1,952. Although so many cases have been notified, there is room for improvement in the manner of notification, for it too frequently happens that teachers do not report them in as they arise, but wait until they have a large batch, the result of which is that it is too late then to effect any good by a visit to the premises, because any mischief that might have occurred would already have taken place. The information, to be of any use, especially in such a disease as Measles, must be given instantly, as it is one which is infectious in its early stages and spreads very rapidly. 149 1907 Table CVIl.

There were 1,651 cases of infectious diseases out of a total of 2,063 notified, of" 80 per cent., isolated in hospitals. This is the largest proportion that has hitherto been removed, as may be seen by the following figures:— 1896 48.4 per cent. 1902 71.9 per cent. 1897 55.7 1903 72.6 „ 1898 58.4 1904 75.5 „ 1899 64.6 ,, 1905 76.1 „ 1900 68.2 1906 77.1 „ 1901 69.6 1907 80.0 „ Out of 1,651 cases isolated in hospital, 1,480, or 89.6 per cent., were admitted to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals. The following are the particulars respecting the isolation of the cases of disease that have occurred during the year. Scarlet Fever.—1,216 cases were notified, of which 1,112 were isolated in hospital, and 984 entered an institution of the Metropolitan Asylums Hoard. Altogether 91.4 per cent. of the known cases of this disease were removed to hospital, leaving only 8'6 per cent. to be attended to at home. It should be pointed out that this is the largest number of cases belonging to Islington that has ever been isolated in hospital. In London the notifications were much more numerous than usual, and caused considerable anxiety to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, so that a resolution was passed by them calling attention to the continued prevalence of Scarlet Fever, notwithstanding the extensive isolation accommodation which they had provided, and praying that the Local Government Board be asked to cause an inquiry to be instituted into the cause of this disease. This resolution was brought under the notice of the Borough Council of Holborn, who addressed a letter to the Islington Council, who referred the matter through the Public Health Committee to the Medical Officer of Health for report, which he did shortly after. The following is his report:— • This subject although reported on in 1908 is dealt with here because it refers to a matter that occurred in 1907. 151 1907 To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, INQUIRY AS TO THE CAUSE OF SCARLET FEVER. The following letter, on which you are requested to report to the Council, has been received from the Borongh Council of Holborn :— " Borough of Holborn, Council Offices, 197, High Holborn, W.C. 11th January, 1908. " Dear Sir, " I am directed by the Council to inform you that they have noticed with much satisfaction that at a recent meeting of the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, a resolution to the following effect was unanimously passed:— 'That in view of the continued prevalence of Scarlet Fever, not'withstanding the extensive isolation accommodation which has been 'provided, the Local Government Board be asked to cause an inquiry 'to be instituted into the cause of this disease, and whether any, and 'if so, what further means can be adopted for its prevention.' "The Council fully agrees with this resolution, and having regard to the great importance of the matter, in both its preventive medicine and financial aspects, has addressed a communication to the Local Government Board in support of the same. "I enclose for the information of your Council copies of Tables of Statistics upon which the resolution was based, and I am to express the hope that your Council will address a letter to the Local Government Board in support of the Managers' action. Yours truly, (Signed) Lionel Walford. "The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Islington." Before expressing an opinion as to the advisability of such an inquiry, it is necessary to lay before you certain circumstances regarding Scarlet Fever, which it would be well for you to know, in order that you, apart from my advice, may form an independent judgment as to the necessity of making such an inquiry as has been suggested. 1. Scarlet Fever is one of the most common ailments of childhood, and its causation has received probably more attention from scientific investigators, sanitary authorities, and their officials, than any other disease. 2. It has been found that out of 1,000 cases 67 persons are under one year. 141 ,, between 1 year and 2 years. 160 ,, ,, 2 years and 3 years. 151 „ „ 3 „ „ 4 „ 119 „ „ 4 „ „ 5 „ 259 „ „ 5 „ „ 10 „ 58 „ „ 10 „ „ 15 „ 48 „ above 15 years. 1907 152 Consequently it is seen that about 95½ per cent. occur among persons under 15 years old. 3. The maximum number of cases usually occurs in October, but generally speaking, the disease is most prevalent from the second week in September to the last week in November. 4. It is generally agreed that the disease is caused by a micro-organism, although bacteriologists dispute whether it is a protozoon, a streptococcus, or a microbe resembling a large gonococcus. A number of bacteriologists of repute, Edgington, Frankel, Freudenberg, Klein. Gordon, Baginsky, Class, have described organisms which they believe to be associated with the cause of the disease. But all that can be positively asserted about the matter is that several bacteria have been found associated with the disease, but have not been proved to be the cause. In England Dr. Mervyn Gordon in 1897, 1898 and 3899 made an investigation for the Local Government Board, and in his report referred the cause to a twofold agency ; namely, that the infection is to be ascribed to Streptococcus Scarlatina, whereas the dangerous phases of this disease, and especially its fatal tendency, frequently result from supplementary invasion of the blood and tissues of the patient by Streptococcus Pyogenes. 5. The poison of Scarlet Fever is probably drawn into the system with the inspired air; it does not, however, enter it through the respiratory channels, but rather through the pharynx and tonsils, which belong to the digestive tract. 6. The infection is considered to lie in the throat, the nasal passages, and the skin; and that it may be contracted directly from (a) the patient, or (b) bodyclothing and bedding, and (c) conveyed even to a distance by such articles as letters, books, etc. 7. It is most infectious when the body temperature is highest. 8. The patient may continue in a state capable of conveying infection for several months; and he can hardly be regarded in a non-infective state for a period of five or six weeks. 9. The disease is not carried by water, but may be conveyed by milk, many epidemics being due to this cause ; and, indeed, it appears to be tolerably certain that in some cases the milk has been infected by a streptococcal disease of the teats of the cow. 10. From an inquiry made a few years ago by Dr C. K. Millard of Leicester, who collected the statistics of Scarlet Fever prevalence in a number of large towns, it did not appear that those towns who had largely practised hospital isolation had had any advantage over those not practising it, for the disease seemed to prevail almost equally in both. Respecting this matter Dr. Vail, formely Medical Officer of Health for Stirlingshire and Dumbartonshire, says:— "Prima facie it is most difficult to believe that hospital isolation is useless. The disease is infectious and no one doubts that where a case is treated at home the patient is best kept in a room by himself, as far away as possible from the rest of the household, and attended by a nurse similary isolated. In this way, as we all hold, infection may often be kept from spreading. But if that be so, surely it is better to remove the patient right out of the house into a 158 1907 hospital where no visitors are allowed, and where there is no communication whatever with the patient's home. In reply to this view it is urged that other agencies are brought into play in the hospital. Patients are collected together in wards containing perhaps as many as twenty beds, so that although they are isolated each from his own home, they are in the hospital not isolated but aggregated. This aggregation, it is alleged, increases infectivity, and the patient leaves the hospital in a condition capable of spreading infection." And then he goes on to state that in the areas he has charge of the question has not arisen because coincidently with the increased provision and use of hospitals Scarlet Fever has diminished not merely in fatalilty but in prevalence, and by means of two charts he shows that whereas in 1093 the attack rate was nearly 8 per 1,000 of the population, in 1895 it was only slightly over 1.5 per 1,ooo, and that the death rate which in 1893 was 0.35 per 1,000 was just under 0.05 per 1,000. These figures indicate that effective hospital isolation can be afforded for the protection of the public; and notwithstanding the idea conveyed by the Holborn Borough Council, I think it will he seen that it has also been afforded in Islington, and, indeed, in London. In my Annual Report for 1904 this matter was discussed, and as it is entirely germane to the question before you, I venture to quote from it now:— "Much has been said and written lately with respect to the isolation of Scarlet Fever in hospitals, and it has been stated by some observers that it has had no appreciable effect in the prevention of the disease. This is a startling statement, and one with which the writer cannot agree; and, indeed, it would require some very strong facts to convince him that the removal of over a thousand cases of infection, for the most part from tenement houses, occupied by numerous children, nearly all susceptible to the disease, has had no effect on the public weal of this borough. When we are considering this question we must recollect that coincident with the notification of infectious diseases, which gave such an impetus to hospital isolation, came the very stringent application of the Education Act, in consequence of which children were whipped up to school by the attendance officer in a manner that, while it has filled the schools, has not been to the best interests of public health, and we should put to ourselves this query: What would have happened if there had been no isolation ? The answer, of course, can only be based on surmise. Schools have ever been a source of infection to scholars, more especially since large eatablishments, where sometimes between one and two thousand children are gathered together, have become general, and frequently cases of Scarlet Fever have been traced to scholars who either had returned to school too early after home treatment, or who, through the ignorance of their parents, in slight cases, had returned while in an infectious state. "But there is also another light in which to look on this question, which is that isolation in hospital prevents an enormous dislocation of school work, as well as of business, especially of businesses where food stuffs or drinks are sold, and where clothing is made. "It is a sine qua non in all school codes that children shall not attend school from houses in which there is a case of Scarlet Fever, and consequently whenever a case is notified to a Medical Officer of Health one of his first acts is to inquire the names of the schools attended by the children living on the premises, so that he may forward the information to the school teacher. He has no option but to do this, for the London Public Health Act, section 55 (4), provides that the Medical Officer of Health shall within twelve hours after the receipt of a certificate send information to the head teacher of the school attended by the patient (if a child) or by any child who is an inmate of the same house as the patient. 1907 154 "It is his implied duty also to inform the parents of the children that they are not to attend school until seven days have elapsed after the disinfection of the premises, for the London County Council School Codes provide that 'it will be necessary for a further period (that is, after disinfection) of seven days to elapse before the return of such children to school.' "Consequently, if the infected child were not removed to hospital, every child in the house would be compelled to remain at home until the patient had completely recovered, and until a week after the premises had been disinfected; that is to say from a period varying from six weeks to three months—a state of affairs that would be intolerable. Again, if the patients were not removed to hospital, businesses where food and Hrink are sold would be ruined, apart from which disadvantage great danger would accrue to the public. Once it got noised abroad, and it would be difficult to keep it secret because oi the visits of the Medical Officer of Health or the Sanitary Inspector, customers would cease to buy, and would purchase their food or drink elsewhere, fearing lest they should contract the infection. It is of course quite possible that there may be very little risk to the public in those businesses in which the females of the household are not employed, because they do not serve in the shop or handle the goods; but there is a very real danger in those businesses where the mother and the daughters, but particularly the former, take an active part in selling the wares, because they are the persons who in nearly every instance nurse the patients. And even when they do not, and when the mothers profess that if their childien are not removed to hospital they will not enter the rooms where the patients lie ill, can any thinking person believe for a moment that any such contract will be kept ? Of course not, because it is entirely contrary to the natural ties that bind humanity. No mother, unless a most unnatural one, could resist the maternal call if her sick child desired her presence, with the result that she would be at one moment in the sick room and at the next in the shop, duty alternating with business, which in these cases is not permissible. It must be either all duty or all business, which is a hopeless proposition under these circumstances. "It is a serious matter for a case of Scarlet Fever to occur on premises where clothing is made, for the Factory and Workshop Act in its 109th section prohibits the making, cleaning, or repairing of wearing apparel in any dwelling house whilst an inmate is suffering from Scarlet Fever. "In consequence of this enactment, one of two things must be done when a case of this disease occurs, either the patient must be removed or the business must be stopped. To stop the business would mean utter ruin to many persons, especially to those poor women, so many of whom are widows, who are home workers endeavouring to earn the merest pittance for the support of their family by making blouses, shirts, ties, and the thousand and one small articles that are worn by ladies. "The question is not has the presence of Scarlet Fever been lessened by hospital isolation, but rather what would have happened in these modern days days under the circumstances that have been detailed if there had been no isolation ? The disease will more than probably never be stamped out, but it can be, and is, kept within due limits by isolation in hospital. But why this recent endeavour to belittle hospital isolation of this disease ? It is because a certain number of what are known as 'return cases' of Scarlet Fever has arisen among brothers and sisters soon after the patients' return to their homes. In Islington, as elsewhere, such cases have occurred, but they are more or less unavoidable. Only recently, for instance, a child who had been in hospital for 155 1907 about nine weeks returned home. She seemed quite well; skin in good condition ; no discharge of mucous from the ears, nose or throat. She had been at home, however, for only four days when one from the nose commenced, with the result that in a few days her sister was infected. More frequently, however, cases have arisen shortly after the arrival home of the patients from hospital, although they have been apparently entirely free from disease on their discharge. "But surely it is no reason because these cases now and again occur that hospital isolation should not be practised, but that on the contrary the patients should be allowed to remain at home, for the most part, living in tenement houses, confined (as they might be but unfortunately are not) to a single room for weeks, with their fathers and mothers constantly with them, and with their brothers and sisters and their friends running in and out to them. Is this what should be allowed ? It certainly could not be prevented—is such a state of affairs conducive to the best interests of the public health ? Is such a practice or isolation in hospital the more likely to prevent the spread of the disease ? Common sense, despite all reasonings to the contrary, will dictate the answers at once and unambiguously." I have not seen any reason since then to alter this opinion. ii. The receipt of the Holborn letter has, however, caused me to examine the records of this borough more closely than before, and I find, as indeed, I expected, that Islington has derived very substantial advantages from the isolation in hospital of its Scarlet Fever patients; and so that these advantages may be definitely appreciated, I have taken quinquennial periods for comparison, because when taken year by year, owing to the fact that in one year there may be a decline, and in another an increase, the true significance of the returns is obscured. These are the years 1891-1895, 1890-1900, and 1901-1905, which I will call respectively the "first," "second" and "third" periods. I may also state that I fixed on 1891 because in that year the notification of infectious disease was first properly enforced, and also because in that year the Public Health (London) Act was passed. My investigation showed that in the first period there were 8,502 cases of Scarlet Fever notified, and these cases fell to 7,512 in the second period, or a decrease of 990 cases; and that the 7,512 cases in turn fell to 5,867 in the third period, or a decrease of 1,645, while the decrease between the first period and the third period amounted to the substantial number of 2,635. And meanwhile the attack rate, i.e. the number of cases per 1,000 of the population, showed a corresponding decline, being for each period respectively 5.20, 4.46 and 3.46 per 1,000 inhabitants. But this is not all, for I found that between the first and second periods the number of deaths fell from 332 to 201, and from 201 to 166 in third period. Thus between the first and second periods there was a decrease of 131 deaths; between the second and third periods a decrease of 35 deaths, and between the first and third periods 166 deaths, or 50 per cent. This is surely most satisfactory. I also found that the admissions to the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals from Islington in these periods were in the first period 3,534 cases; in the second period 4,660, or an increase of 1,126 cases, and in the third period 4,612 cases, or an actual decrease of 48 cases on the return for the second period, but an increase of 1,078 cases on that of the first period. With respect to the percentages of the notified cases which were admitted to hospitals, I found that 42 per cent. of them were admitted in the first period, 62 per cent. in the second period and 79 per cent. in the third period. It must be noted, however, that the 79 per cent. in the third period represented 48 fewer admissions than the 62 per cent. did in the second period. M 1907 150 Lastly, I found that the percentage of deaths to cases, or the fatality, has fallen considerably, namely from 3.9 per cent. in the first period to 2.7 in the second period, since which time it has been practically stationary, the percentage being 2.8 in the third period. Thus the fatality has decreased by 28 per cent. mainly effected by the isolation, nursing and treatment of patients in hospital. between the first and third periods, which must be looked on as a very great achievement,mainly effected by the isolation, nursing and treatment of patients in hospital. Quinquennial periods. Cases. Deaths. No. of cases admitted to M.A.B. hospitals. Per cent, of cases admitted to M.A.B. hospitals. Per cent, of deaths to cases.

When I had ascertained the results indicated in the last section of this report, I determined to apply the same principle of splitting up the years into quinquennial periods and to examine the London figures as supplied by the Holborn Borough Council in a similar manner, with the result that I found that in the first period (1891-95) there were 112,781 cases of Scarlet Fever notified, and that these cases fell to 97,278 in the second period (1896-1900) or a decrease of 15,503, and that the 97,278 cases in turn fell to 82,064 in the third period (1901-1905) or a decrease of 15,214, while the decrease between the first period and the third period amounted to the very substantial number of 30,717. And meanwhile the attack rate showed a corresponding decline, being for each period respectively 5.23, 4.32 and 3.55 per 1000 inhabitants. But this is not all, for I found that between the first and second periods the number of deaths fell from 5,150 to 3,043, and from 3,043 to 2,410 in the third period. Thus between the first and second periods there was a decrease of 2,107 deaths; between the second and third periods a decrease of 633 deaths; and between the first and third periods 2,740 deaths, or 46.8 per cent. A most wonderful record ! I also found that the admissions to the Metropolitan Asylums Boards Hospitals from the metropolis in these periods were in the first period 56,319 cases; in the second period 67,685, or an increase of 11,366; and in the third period 68,821 cases, or an increase of only 1,136 cases on the return for the second period. Finally the increase between the first and third periods was 12,502 cases, or 22.2 per cent. With respect to the percentages of the notified cases which were admitted to the hospitals, I found that 50 per cent. of the London cases were admitted in the first period, 70 per cent in the second period, and 84 per cent in the third period. It must be noted, however, that the 84 per cent. in the third period represented an increase of only 1,136 admissions, whereas the increase of 70 per cent. in the second period represented an increase of 11,366 cases. Lastly I found that the percentage of deaths to cases, or the fatality, has fallen very considerably, namely, from 4.6 per cent. in the first period to 3.1 in the second period; and then to 2.9 in the third period. Thus the fatality has decreased by 36.9 per cent. between the first and third periods, which, as I said with respect to the reduced fatality in Islington, must be considered a very great achievement, mainly effected by the isolation, nursing, and treatment of the patients. The following table gives a synopsis of the above facts respecting London:— 157 [1907 Quinquennial periods. Cases. Deaths. No. of cases admitted to M.A.B. hospitals. Percentage of cases admitted to M.A.B. hospitals. Percentage of deaths to cases. Attack rate, i.e., cases per 1,000 of the population. 1891.1895 112,781 5,150 56,319 50 4.6 5.23 1896.1900 97,278 3,043 67,685 70 3.1 4.32 1901.1905 82,064 2,410 68,821 84 2.9 3.55 13. In the two preceding sections I have dealt with the figures in quinquennial periods from 1891 because there were no particulars available as to the cases occurring in Islington and in London prior to that period. I would, however, like to point out that the decline in the fatality among the cases treated at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals during the years 1875.1906 from 13.7 to 2.9 per cent., or a decrease of 78.8 per cent. in the rate, appears to me to indicate not only that the type of the disease may have changed, but that such change has been influenced by the isolation in hospital of the most virulent cases. Indeed this seems to be so, for one rarely or never now meets with those anginose or malignant types which within my own experience were quite common. Hence it is not unfair to infer, it seems to me, that hospital isolation may have been to a large extent the cause of the very considerable decrease in the number of these cases; and if this be so, then the hospitals undoubtedly have effected a great good, and are worth the money that has been expended on them. 14. In London in the same period, that is since 1875, the annual death.rate from this disease fell from 1,056 per million of the population to 117, or a decrease of 88.9 per cent., a fact which seems also to support the inference that the type of disease is not so malignant as formerly. Another circumstance is that since 1894, when the admissions into hospital began to become really formidable, that is to say when they reached over 60 per cent. of the known cases, down to now when they amount to 89.5 per cent., the death.rate from Scarlet Fever has concurrently, though irregularly, fallen, from which one may judge the cause by the effect. Year. Percentage of Admissions to Hospitals to Notifications. Death.rate per million Inhabitants. 1896 62.9 207 1897 66.8 176 1898 73.9 130 1899 73.9 89 1900 75.70 8l 1901 81.8 128 1902 80.3 121 1903 83.8 77 1904 84.5 79 1905 88.6 117 1906 88.5 113 15. The number of cases now removed to hospital is so large that it is impossible to imagine or, indeed, believe that isolation of Scarlet Fever can be useless, more especially when it is recollected that its infection is so persistent and M 2 1907] 158 long lived. Indeed, I think that I have proved this is not so in the three preceding sections of this report. When we consider for a moment what would happen if these cases were not removed, but allowed to remain at home in tenemented dwellings during the whole time that the patient remains in an infected state, we are driven to the conclusion that constant supervision of the patients would be necessary to see that they did not expose themselves or were not exposed by their parents or guardians during the long period of their convalescence, and that this would j ecessiiate the employment of a large staff of visitors. Apart from which consideration there are the disabilities that would necessarily follow school children and parents, which are fully set out under the ioth section of this report. It is, therefore, necessary, when considering the cost of the hospitals, also to recollect that if the use of the hospitals be largely curtailed, there will be a large expenditure in the direction indicated, as well as a loss of money through the absence of children from school, and also a large decrease in the earnings of the parents or guardians of the children living in the infected houses. 16. The cost of isolating these cases has naturally arisen, and therefore we find that whereas in 1890 it was £112,420, in 1906 it was £351,408, or more than threefold (1: 3.12) while in the same period the Scarlet Fever admissions had increased in practically the same ratio (1: 2.89). We have now these facts before us respecting Scarlet Fever:— (a) That the disease is chiefly one of young life. (b) That it is usually most prevalent about October. (c) That Bacteriologists are not agreed as to the bacteria which cause it. (d) That the germ of the disease enters the system with the inspired air, lodging in the digestive tract. (e) That the infection is spread by the patient, by body clothing and by articles that have been in contact with him; that he is most infectious when his temperature is high; and that he is liable to convey infection for five or six weeks. Also that infection may be conveyed by milk. (f) That it is stated that apparently towns which have not largely protected themselves by means of hospitals have suffered little more than those which have. (g) That the number of cases has decreased in London by 30,717 in the quennial period 1901.5 as compared with the quinquennium 1891.95. (h) That the proportion of the population attacked annually in the same periods has fallen from 5.23 to 3.55 per 1,000 of the population. (i) That in the same periods the deaths have decreased by 2,740 or 46.8 per cent. (j) That in the same periods its fatality (the ratio of deaths to cases) has fallen 36.9 per cent. (k) That the annual expenditure on the hospitals has risen in proportion to the number of cases admitted, viz., from £112,420 to £351,408, while the cases increased from 6,537 to 17,983. (/) That if cases are not to be removed to hospital, a heavy expenditure must be incurred in watching them, as well as their parents and guardians, to prevent them spreading the infection, while schooling, and work and businesses will be interfered with. These are the chief facts respecting the disease so far as they concern us. 159 [1907 When the subject was under the consideration of the Metropolitan Asylums Board I noticed the mover of the resolution desired the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the cause of the disease. I think that this is a cumbrous and costly body, and, indeed, I doubt that any inquiry at all is necessary even with respect to the cause of the disease, which at present is considered to be uncertain. At all events, Bacteriologists disagree on the subject. This seems to me to be the crux of the whole question, for if this is once definitely agreed upon by these scientists, then indeed we may hope that the medical staff of the hospitals will be able to determine accurately, before the discharge of the patients, if they are free from infection. It is unfortunate that at present they are unable to determine the fact, at all events they fail in many instances to do so with certainty, as shown by the circumstances that only within the last few weeks we have had several cases in Islington which were infected by brothers or sisters recently discharged from hospital. Many workers, in many countries, have studied, and are studying, this question, and, therefore, it is probable that some day the truth will be known. Whether or not a Government Inquiry on an extended scale would result in gaining more certain knowledge on this subject is a moot point ; indeed I am inclined to think that the Local Government Board will rest for the present on the investigations carried out only a few years ago by Dr. Mervyn Gordon (vide section 4) leaving to private research, or to other Governments, the task of carrying the matter further. With respect to the hospitals I think it will be admitted that they are well managed so far as the medical treatment is concerned; that the figures show that they have done a great work, and that they deserve the confidence of the public. Complaints against them are rarely, if ever, heard; which, considering that fully a half million patients have been treated in them since 1890, testifies to their good management better than words can; and above all that they have been instrumental in checking the spread of the disease. With the facts which I have adduced before me, I am of opinion that it is not necessary to institute the Inquiry which the Holborn Borough Council desire, but as the Metropolitan Asylums Board themselves seem to be frightened at their expenditure, without apparentlv having made a full examination into the true significance of the figures which were placed before them by the gentleman who I understand brought the question forward in the two public bodies I have named, I do not suppose you will do anything to prevent them obtaining an inquiry if the Local Government Board should be disposed to grant it on the grounds they have adduced; but whether or not you will assist them is another matter, and one, as a large money question is indirectly involved, I must leave to your own discretion to decide. I am, Your faithful servant, A. E. HARRIS, Medical Officer of Health.

It has been the custom of the Medical Officer of Health for a very long period to draw attention annually to the fact that a considerable number of cases of the notifiable infectious diseases are discovered on business premises where either clothing is made or food is prepared and sold. During the year to which this report refers as many as 260 cases of infectious disease were discovered on business premises, on which the following businesses, besides many others in smaller numbers, a full list of which is given in the Table CX., were conducted:— Artificial Teeth Making 5 Blousemaking 4 Bakers 5 Boxmaking 3 Bootmaking 9 Confectioners 10 Dressmaking 11 Greengrocers 11 General Dealing 6 Laundry 10 Mangling 4 Milkshop 9 Newsagent 5 Public House 10 From these particulars one can judge how necessary it is that precautions should be taken in these cases and that unless there is absolutely no possibility of the disease being conveyed from the patient, that he should be removed from the premises and isolated in hospital. In dealing with those cases in houses where wearing apparel is made, especially in the case of Small Pox and Scarlet Fever, section 109 of the Factory and Workshop Act has been always found of the greatest assistance, for it provides that " if the occupier of a factory or workshop or any place from which work is given out, or any contractor employed by any such occupier, causes or allows wearing apparel to be made, cleaned or repaired, in any dwelling house or building occupied therewith, whilst any inmate of the dwelling house is suffering from scarlet fever or small pox, then, unless he proves that he was not aware of the existence of the illness in the dwelling house, and could not reasonably have been expected to become aware of it, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10." It need hardly be said that such a stringent clause as this has a very quickening effect on people who are anxious to retain the patient at home. The return as set out in Table CX., shows that 164 cases of Scarlet Fever, 51 cases of Diphtheria, 22 Enteric Fever, 22 cases of Erysipelas and 1 of Continued Fever were discovered on business premises. 167 1907 Table CX.

During 1907 as many as 471 specimens were examined for the purpose of diagnosing Diphtheria, Enteric Fever or Phthisis for the medical profession practising in Islington. This is the largest number that has hitherto been sent to the Lister Institute, which undertakes examinations for the Council. Of this number 223 were specimens of membrane or sputum from the throats of suspected diphtheritic persons, 59 were specimens of the blood of persons suspected to be suffering from Enteric Fever, and 189 were sputa obtained from persons suspected to be suffering from Phthisis. Diphtheria.—223 specimens of membrane were examined, of which 88, or 39.4 per cent., gave positive results. This is the largest number of specimens that has hitherto been examined in the Borough. In the preceding year 167 were received. Enteric Fever. Of the 59 specimens of blood submitted to the Widal test, 25, or 42.3 per cent., indicated that the patients were suffering from Enteric Fever. Phthisis.—189 examinations were made of the sputum of persons suspected to be suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and of these 68, or 36.0 per cent., were found to contain the bacilli of pulmonary consumption. The examinations of the year bring up the total number that have been made since 1898 for the Madical Profession to 3,129, of which 1,226 were for the purpose of diagnosing Diphtheria, 721 for Enteric Fever and 1,182 for Phthisis.

The vaccination returns of the Borough are among the most important annually issued, for although we are passing through a quiescent period so far as Small Pox is concerned, yet at any moment, if its one great preventive, vaccination, were neglected, we might have an outbreak of the disease. It may be news to many people that there is hardly a week passes in which some of the London Medical Officers of Health are notified by the Port Medical Officers of Health of London, Southampton, Liverpool, Bristol or other places where passengers land from ocean-going steamers, of the arrival of persons in England who are on their way to London residences, who have come from ports infested with Small Pox or Cholera, or who have been in ships in which these diseases have appeared. Consequently there is always a possibility of an imported case causing an outbreak of disease. The returns show that 6,260 vaccinations were successfullv performed, representing 79.9 per cent. of the births, less 696 infants who had died unvaccinated. This is somewhat better than the last published statistic for England and Wales, which is 75.3 per cent. o 188 1907] During the seven years in which the Royal Commission was inquiring into the question, vaccination received a decided set back, but the report and the subsequent Act of 1898, together with the Order made under it have gradually had a beneficial effect, so that the vaccination of the country has generally improved. In Islington there was considerable slackness during these years as well as in the four years that followed, but since 1900 there has been a steady improvement, which may be noticed in the tables given below. The "conscientious objector," a creation of the 1898 Act, has not made much of an appearance anywhere, but the little that he did was accentuated by the manner with which he was treated by some Magistrates. His cry was» however, loud enough to induce the Government to pass an Act in 1907, entitled the "Vaccination Act, 1907" and described in its preamble "An Act to substitute a Statutory Declaration for the certificate required under section two of the Vaccination Act, 1898, of Conscientious Objector." The section dealing with this subject reads as follows:— (1) "No parent or other person shall be liable to any penalty under section twenty-nine "or section thirty-one of the Vaccination Act, 1867, if within four months from the "birth of the child he makes a statutory declaration that he conscientiously believes "that vaccination would be prejudicial to the health of the child, and within seven "days thereafter delivers or sends by post the declaration to the Vaccination " Officer of the district; " The form of declaration is as follows: — "I, of in the Parish of "in the County of being the parent (or person having the custody) "of a child named , who was born on the day of "19 , do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare that I conscientiously believe "that vaccination would be prejudicial to the health of the child, and I make this "solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of "the provisions of the Statutory Declarations Act, 1835. "Dated this day of 19 . Signed. "Declared before me, at on the day of "Commissioner for Oaths (or Justice of the Peace, or other Officer "authorised to receive a statutory declaration.") On the 21st May, 1907, the Local Government Board made a General Order amending their Vaccination Order of 1898 and relating to other matters having a direct bearing on the contracts entered into between the Public Vaccinators and the several Boards of Guardians in England and Wales. Shortly, it may be stated that the Order considerably reduced the five shilling minimum fee provided for Public Vaccinators by the 1898 Order, but makes no alteration in the minima fees for Vaccination Officers. 189 [1907 Years.

By this term is understood the fumigation, cleansing, spraying and stripping of rooms, the disinfection of schools, as well as of articles of clothing and household bedding which have become infectcd by an epidemic disease. Disinfection of Rooms.—As many as 2,402 rooms, as contrasted with 2,685 in the preceding year, were disinfected. The disinfectant employed was formaldehyde, either in the form of vapour or as a solution. This method of disinfection has been very successful. Cleansing and Stripping of Rooms.—760 rooms were cleansed, sprayed or stripped in 1897, as compared with 552 in the preceding year. This increase occurred during the second and third quarters, as compared with 1906, as may be seen by the following statement:— 1906. 1907. 1st Quarter 181 182 2nd Quarter 89 241 3rd Quarter 109 168 4th Quarter 173 169 The increase was due principally to the prevalence of measles, the heads of families being anxious to have their rooms thoroughly disinfected. Disinfection of Schools.—Class rooms in the following schools were disinfected, generally owing to Measles or Scarlet Fever among the scholars:— 1st Quarter. Gifford Street, L.C.C. (Measles.) 2nd Quarter. Blackstock Road, L.C.C. (Measles.) Tollington Park College. (Scarlet Fever.) St. John's, Upper Holloway. (Scarlet Fever.) 3rd Quarter. Ecclesbourne Road, L.C.C.

(Scarlet Fever.) St. John's, Upper Holloway. (Scarlet Fever.) Whittington School, Highgate Hill, L.C.C. (Measles.) Canonbury Road, L.C.C. (Diphtheria.) Verminous Premises—In 20 instances disinfection of rooms which were found to be verminous was undertaken by the Public Health Department, in addition to which many premises were cleansed by the owners of property on the service of a notice under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. These provisions have proved of the very greatest utility in the Borough, so that where formerly we were unable to effect cleansing, no difficulty is experienced now. 193 [1907 Table CXVII.

With the exception of the two years 1896 and 1902, the year 1907 was the busiest experienced at the Disinfecting Station, for 30,083 large articles which had been exposed to infection were sterilized. 194 1907] It is now 13 years since the Disinfecting Station was established, during which period 346,099 large articles removed from infected houses have been disinfected. At one time this work was performed by a contractor, who charged on an average 2s. 9d. for each bed, palliasse, or mattress, 6d. each for blankets, 2s. 6d. for each carpet, and other charges in proportion. If these charges were in practice to-day, the cost of the disinfection of the articles mentioned in the subsequent table, which does not include small articles such as handkerchiefs, stockings, socks, aprons, &c., for each of which a charge of 3d. used to be made, would have been £1,503 3s., whereas the actual cost of the Disinfecting Station, including repayment of interest on loan, keep of horses and men's wages, was £869 17s. 7d., or less repayment and interest on loans, £477 4s. 3d. But apart from these considerations of cost, the work is better done, for in the old days, the “purification," as it was called, and rightly so, for it was not sterilization, was effected by bringing sulphurous acid gas in contact with the goods in a closed chamber. The disinfection was never thorough, for the gas, not being under pressure, did not permeate the articles. The following tables give particulars of the work done by them during the year, as well as a summary of that carried out in the 13 years 1895-1907. TABLE CIX.

Fortunately very few persons, indeed, only one individual, required its use for fever or otherwise the other services to which it was put would have had to cease. One nurse also used the Shelter House after attendance on a patient who contracted Scarlet Fever, during her confinement. Table CXX.

STATE OF PAUPERISM. COMMON LODGING HOUSES. DUST REMOVAL. 198 1907] FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ADMINISTRATION. In accordance with the requirements of the Factory and Workshops Act, it is the duty of the Medical Officer of Health to submit an annual report on the manner in which the provisions of this Act are carried out in the district for which he is responsible, and in conformity with them he now submits the following statement:— Inspectors.—There are 3 Inspectors, 1 male and 2 female, employed on this work, of whom the male inspector and 1 female inspector look after factories and workshops where men and women are respectively employed, while the second female inspector visits the homes of homeworkers, and also inspects the kitchens or restaurants. Each of these Inspectors have written reports on their work during the year, which are appended herewith, and which set it forth very fully. Inspections and Visits.—The total number of inspections and visits paid to the several places under the charge of the Inspectors was 10,727, as contrasted with 6,980 made during the previous year. The particulars of these inspections and visits are as follows:— Factories, including Factory Laundries 557 Workshops, including Workshop Laundries 2,557 Workplaces other than Outworkers' Premises 133 Bakehouses 621 Restaurant Kitchens 746 Outworkers' Premises 937 Miscellaneous re-inspections and calls 5,176 10,727 Notices Served.—These visits resulted in the detection of 2,303 sanitary detects, of which 2,026 had been remedied at the end of the year, and entailed the service of 643 intimation notices and 16 statutory notices. Of these notices 71 were served on the owners of factories, 292 of workshops, 17 of work places other than outworkers' premises, 215 of restaurant kitchens, and 34 of outworkers' premises. In addition to these, 38 notices were served for the abatement of 101 nuisances or defects on outworkers' premises. 199 [1907 Registers.—2,215 workshops and workplaces, exclusive of outworkers' premises, are at present on the registers, as compared with 2,116 in the preceding year. These workshops and workplaces contain 3,333 rooms. There are also on the register 1,989 outworkers' premises, consisting of the same number of rooms, so that altogether there were 5,322 rooms on the register at the end of the year. Sanitation.—The sanitary work with respect to the factories and workshops and other workplaces was, as usual, of an effective character, as no less than 2,303 defects were discovered, of which 2,026 had been remedied at the end of the year. Since 1896 something like 17,507 serious offences against sanitation have been discovered and remedied. This is a very great volume of work, and shows that the Inspectors engaged on it have not been idle. The following table gives a synopsis of the work that has been done in the last 12 years. 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 Total Overcrowding 26 12 15 14 22 14 4 13 4 13 30 9 176 Ventilation 14 13 2 5 4 3 5 8 11 4 8 31 108 Dirty rooms 311 195 109 99 217 218 231 423 630 412 448 970 4,263 Drains 554 458 375 313 216 177 90 50 19 15 4 19 2,290 W.C.'s 420 325 341 355 411 375 154 161 165 151 190 620 3,668 Water supplies 79 41 35 20 19 13 83 54 18 38 17 23 440 Surface drains 79 109 87 51 78 81 2 53 40 34 39 45 698 Cleansing 412 375 393 424 437 387 558 441 609 490 497 841 5.864 Cleanliness.—The reports of the inspectors show that 970 premises were uncleanly, of which 841 had been remedied at the end of the year. This number compares with 497 in the preceding year, and 490 in 1905. So great an increase is due to the fact that two lady inspectors are now at work where only one was employed previously, and, therefore, it is only natural that the amount of work should have increased. 200 1907] Effluvium Nuisances.—No nuisances of this character were reported. Want of Air Space, Overcrowding.—In only 9 cases was overcrowding discovered, all of which were abated before the end of the year. This contrasts with 30 cases in 1906 and 13 in 1905. Altogether 176 cases have come under the notice since 1896, and these have been remedied, This is not a large number considering the numerous workshops and workplaces in Islington. Want of Drainage of Floors.—45 cases, generally in laundries, where the floors were not drained so as to prevent water standing on them, were discovered. Of these 38 had been remedied at the end of the year. This number contrasts with 38 in the preceding year and 39 in 1905. Want of Ventilation.—31 cases were detected, of which 28 had been remedied when the year closed. These defects were discovered in workrooms. In the preceding year only 8 cases came under notice, and in 1905, 4. Sanitary Accommodation.—In 28 cases insufficient sanitary accommodation was discovered, and in 198 cases it was unsuitable or defective. In 375 instances it was foul and in 19 cases there was no accommodation provided for the different sexes. Bakehouses.—There are at present on the register 256 bakehouses (of which 46 are not in use but which are inspected at intervals), to which 621 visits were paid in the course of the year, as contrasted with 215 in 1906. These bakehouses were also inspected by the Superintendent and Chief Sanitary Inspector, Mr. J. R. Leggatt, who reported favourably on their condition as compared with that in the preceding years. It is satisfactory to find that there was no occasion to serve notices with respect to nuisances at these places. The misuse of bakehouses for drying clothes has been discovered in several instances, and the proprietors who allowed them to be used in this way have been requested not to do so again. There is, however, no legal offence committed, although it will be admitted that it is highly improper conduct. 201 [1907 Mr. Leggatt's report is as follows:— Town Hall, Upper Street, Islington, N. July 8th, 1907. Dear Sir, I beg to inform you that I have recently completed my annual inspection of the whole of the Bakehouses in the Borough. It is with much pleasure that I am able to report that I found them in an improved condition. I have still, however, to draw attention to the objectionable practice of clothes being washed in the bakehouses. On one occasion I found a quantity of very dirty underclothing, etc., lying on the floor and washing being done in close proximity to a newly drawn batch of bread, and on another a bakehouse was temporarily converted into a laundry to such an extent that to inspect it was a matter of difficulty. In several instances I discovered clothes being aired or dried prior to being worn. It would appear that the occupiers of bakehouses are under the impression that they can do just as they please in this respect, and it is only by constant supervision and by frequently reminding them that a Bakehouse “is a house or building for baking " that we can hope for a change for the better. I am of opinion that if the Master Bakers' Association would issue instructions as to the proper use of a bakehouse, it would not only assist the Council's Officers in their work, but would bring about a much desired improvement. I am, Yours faithfully, JAMES R. LEGGATT. Superintendent and Chief Sanitary Inspector. Dr. A. E. Harris, Medical Officer of Health.

The addresses of 2,268 outworkers were received from the employers in Islington, and 2,788 from the Medical Officers of Health of other Boroughs. As Mrs. Young points out in her report, these figures refer to the total numbers of the two half-yearly returns, but the actual number of outworkers is 2,597, of whom 1,989 are resident in the Borough, an increase of 632 on the preceding year. Restaurant Kitchens and Places where Food is prepared.— The register shows that there were 452 registered kitchens, with 593 rooms, on the register at the end of the year, as contrasted with 336 in the preceding year. The work of inspecting these was carried out entirely by Mrs. Young, who reports that it became necessary to serve 245 notices on the proprietors with respect to various nuisances that were discovered. The amount of sanitary work effected at these places, as shown by Mrs. Young's report, fully justifies the action of the Council in appointing an Inspector, part of whose duty is to look after restaurant kitchens. In the past these kitchens received no attention, but any person with an unprejudiced mind who reads the Inspector's report, which is embodied herewith, must admit that it was high time that action was taken with respect to them. As the Inspector deals very fully with them it is not necessary to enter into a discussion here. Workshops Notified to H.M. Inspector. Under the provisions of section 133 of the Factory and Workshops Act it is required that the Medical Officer of Health when he becomes a vare that any woman, young child or person is employed in a workshop, shall forthwith send notice to H.M. Inspector of Factories for the district. 207 [1907 In compliance with this regulation, the following workshops were notified to H.M. Inspector:— Work places notified to H.M. Inspector 1907. Trade.

Inspector, the visits paid were more particularly directed towards the keeping in order of the sanitary conveniences, but in addition all sanitary defects noticed have been dealt with. These visits have in most cases been well received by those in charge, who appear to welcome any official inspection, as being an assistance in the proper supervision of those who are responsible for these places. A marked improvement in the general condition of the sanitary conveniences has been noticed in several of the larger factories during the year. Laundries.—There were on the Register at the close of the year 134 Laundries. Of these 63 are small workplaces where the work is done by members of the family, occasionally assisted in the busy time by one or two employees. The other Laundries employ at least three women, and come under the Factory Acts. Some of the domestic laundries have been at one time under the Factory Act, and have employed a good number of women, but are now gradually getting less work and consequently employing less labour, owing to the competition of the f actory Laundries, which will doubtless eventually absorb all the work. In fact, already some of the small laundries appear to be very little more than Receiving Offices, as only part of the work is done on the premises, the rest, which requires special attention, being sent to some of the larger laundries. The new provisions which have lately come into force with regard to laundries will no doubt increase the difficulties in the working of the smaller laundries, where there is little extra space to spare to allow for the sufficient separation of the stove from the ironing room or table. 1 his, however, is a very necessary provision, as the ironing room tends to become unduly heated, particularly in summer. Lven with doors and windows open, it is practically impossible to keep the room at a reasonable temperature. This condition is aggravated where drying as well as \roning is done, by keeping windows and doors closed. This, though it retards the drying process, is necessitated in certain localities and near certain industries by the fact that the clothes would be soiled by the smuts and dust from the open windows. In some of the smaller laundries the work is done in basement rooms, where there is not a free current of air, and where the conditions, without exactly contravening any legal regulations, are anything but ideal. Some of the larger workshop laundries on the register approximate in their structure and arrangements to the conditions present in the Factory Laundries, and are satisfactory as regards ventilation, means of escape for steam in the washhouse, drainage of iloors, and other details which go to make up an ideal laundry. Workshops—There weare on the Register at the end of the year 826 workshops, 203 having been added during the year, and 222 removed. They are as follows: — WORKSHOPS ON REGISTER. Nature of business.

In many cases the work is entirely distinct, being done in separate workrooms, but in 185 workrooms men and women work together. As regards the number of workroms, this is only an approximate number, as arrangements are frequently altered, and employees shifted about from room to room. There is a slight reduction in the total number of workshops, due, as before, to trade depression. Most of the industries visited during the year did not appear to be in a flourishing condition, many employers stating that trade has been gradually becoming worse, and that since 1900 each year has been worse in this respect than the preceding. Some of the workshops are really more in the nature of domestic workshops, as outsiders are employed only occasionally, but they have not been removed from the register, as, should trade improve, the occupiers hope to employ as before. The bad weather during 1907 affected the clothing industries unfavourably. This also accounts for the very flourishing condition of one industry visited, viz., the making of waterproof goods. Although there is still on the register a considerable number of dressmakers who execute what might be called "bespoke" orders, yet this trade shows distinct signs of declining in importance. While the better class dressmakers are still fairly busy, those who work for a lower class do not get the same amount of patronage as formerly, because their customers prefer to buy their garments ready made. Although this is not so economical in the end, the initial expense is less, and there is a saving of time and trouble. A noticeable feature in connection with the industries visited is the fact which so many employers emphasise, viz., that when they need employees and advertise for them, they cannot get suitable persons. The applicants are, speaking generally, few in number and unsuitable in kind. An experienced employee is difficult to get, as, owing to the regrettable decline in the apprenticeship system and the irregularity in the present-day employment, a proper practical knowledge of any trade is difficult to acquire. In the case of many of the workshops, the employers are outworkers, taking out work from a warehouse and getting it done by the help of others, either indoor or outdoor hands. These middlemen often frankly admit that the workers are badly paid. They find it impossible to pay good wages when they themselves scarcely get a living wage. The whole system seems to be in a state of chaos. At present there is no standard rate of pay. Different firms pay different prices for practically the same article, and the same firm changes its own rate of pay from time to time, generally for the worse. At the same time, the tendency of the work is to become more elaborate. When deductions are made for cotton, fines, tram fares and other expenses, there appears to be very little profit left for either the middleman or his employees. It is to be hoped that the Bill, which has lately passed its second reading, may speedily become law, and that wages Boards may be established whose duty it will be to enforce a legal minimum wage. The people concerned are as a rule too apathetic to notice any efforts made towards legislation for their benefit, but some are anxiously awaiting developments and wondering why nothing has been done before. One striking defect in the system, and one that cannot be dealt with at present, is the fact that the person who takes out work from some warehouses is kept waiting a considerable time,, sometimes three or four hours, either standing on the stairs, in draughty passages, or in some other unsuitable place. Seats in such places are the exception rather than the rule. This method of doing business seems unnecessary, as well as inhuman. Unhappily, though complaints have been received regarding the matter, nothing can be done legally to remedy it. On the other hand, it has been found that in some places where work is given out, the utmost consideration is shown, one place which came under notice supplying tea in bad weather. Workshop occupiers frequently appear to have an objection to admit that they employ outworkers, or to send their names and addresses to the local authority. There is no apparent reason for this beyond the trouble involved in sending lists, unless it is the feeling that their private affairs are being inquired into unnecessarily. One ingenious method of evading the law in this respect was noticed during the year, though 1007] 216 possibly it was not intentional. One firm gave out work to be done outside the factory. The workers bought the material at the warehouse, made the required article, and this article was then bought back by the firm. These workers, while really outworkers, were nominally manufacturing their own materials into the finished product. Cleanliness.—During the year 152 instances of want of cleanliness were found. Of these, 133 had been remedied before the end of the year. Many of the workshops which have been on the register for some time are very satisfactory in this respect. The employers are now aware that a certain standard must be maintained, and without waiting for a reminder from an inspector, have the cleansing of the walls and ceilings done in their less busy time. In these cases the visits of an inspector are not so necessary for the discovery of actual nuisances or defects as for the keeping of the employer up to a certain standard through expectation of a visit. Overcrowding.—Only nine instances of overcrowding were dealt with during the year, a decrease of 16 as compared with the number of the previous year. In the majority of workrooms visited, the number of employees was well within the legal limit. Ventilation.—Although only two instances of workplaces with insufficient means of ventilation were noticed during the year, yet, as before, many workrooms possessing sufficient means were found on inspection stuffy and close, especially in the winter months. The usual alleged reason for the want of fresh air is that the rooms are cold, and for the same reason gas jets are used to warm the room, thus vitiating the air to a greater extent. It is difficult to see how this state of affairs can be improved. The workers, often thinly clad and badly fed, naturally feel acutely any current or influx of colder air, and so strongly oppose all efforts in that direction. Windows may be opened for a time, but unless a daily or weekly visit be paid by an inspector, this is only a temporary advantage. Sanitary accommodation.—During the year, four instances of insufficient accommodation were found, 120 closets were found in a dirty condition, 111 were found unsuitable or defective, and 11 not separate for sexes. Of these, before the close of the year, 104 had been cleansed, and 104 had been repaired. The instances of insufficient or want of separate accommodation were dealt with by Mr. West. Other defects.—In addition to the above, 134 other defects, such as defective dustbins, cisterns, etc., were found,, and of these 101 were remedied under my personal supervision before the end of the year. The others were dealt with by the other Inspectors, or have since been remedied. Two instances of defects existing in workshops were notified from the Home Office, and were duly remedied, and a report of the action taken sent to II.M. Inspector. Notices.—Eighty-nine intimation notices (10 in connection with Factories and 79 in connection with Workshops) and nine Statutory Notices have been served during the year. Most of the nuisances found were abated after verbal notice had been given to the occupier. Workshops notified to Home Office.—During the year 130 workshops in which the required abstract was not affixed, or which had not already been visited by H.M. Inspector, were notified to the Home Office. Particulars of these will be found comprised in the accompanying list. Workroom Cards.—263 workroom cards have been distributed, specifying the cubic space and the number of employees allowed in each workroom. Infectious Disease.—It was found necessary to visit eight workshops during the year re infectious disease. All necessary precautions were taken to prevent any spread of the disease. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, JOSEPHINE J. BROWN, Sanitary Inspector of Workshops 217 [1907 MRS. YOUNG'S REPORT. Town Hall, Upper Street, N. 30th March, 1908. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, Herewith I have pleasure in presenting to you a report of the work done during the year 1907 in reference to Restaurant Kitchens and Outworkers' premises. During that period 3,056 calls and inspections have been made, as follows :—■ Inspections of Restaurant Kitchens 723 Re-inspections and calls 655 Inspection of Homeworkers' premises 937 Re-inspections and calls 741 3,056 279 Notices were served to cover 847 defects. 272 Workroom cards delivered specifying cubic space. Restaurant Kitchens.—452 Kitchens, with 593 Workrooms were on the register at the close of the year. At the beginning of the year there were 336; of these 22 have been closed. The following is a brief summary of the general conditions (satisfactory or otherwise) found on inspection :— Satisfactory. Unsatisfactory. Total. Restaurants 45 31 76 Do. attached to Public-Houses 61 10 71 Coffee and Dining Rooms 168 94 262 Tea Rooms 73 28 101 Fried Fish shops 66 41 107 Ham and Beef shops 22 10 32 Stewed eel shops 12 9 21 Tripe, etc., shops 3 2 5 Oyster Bars 2 1 3 Provision shops selling cooked meat 31 14 45 Total 483 240 723 1907] 218 Want of bins for offal, or house refuse 86 Unpaved or defective yards 14 Want of impervious wall where fish is cleansed 8 Defective flushing cistern 6 Drainage defects ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 24 Foul sanitary arrangements 47 Want of separate sanitary convenience 3 Miscellaneous defects 127 Utensils in dirty condition 128 Dirty (or improper) storage of food 149 813 677 of these are remedied, as follows :— Dirty walls, ceilings and floors 137 Dirty and dilapidated walls and ceilings 12 Want of ventilation 19 Drinking water cisterns cleansed or covered 38 Bins supplied for offal, or house refuse 80 Yards paved or repaired 12 Sanitary accommodation cleansed 46 Walls rendered impervious where fish cleansing is done 7 Defective flushing cistern 5 Drainage defects remedied (under supervision of Inspector West or District Inspector) 20 Want of separate sanitary convenience 3 Miscellaneous defects 100 Improper storage of food (improvement) 109 Dirty utensils (improvement) 89 677 There appears to be a need for more efficient legislation for the protection of the public in places where food is prepared for sale, and any such legislation should define the structural conditions in which catering for profit and the processes connected therewith may be carried on. Basement kitchens are extremely unsatisfactory. Good ventilation and cleanliness are almost impossible where they are used and they are a constant menace to the health of the public and the persons employed in them. The usual means of ventilation, and the only inlet for fresh air (viz., by a grated opening from the street pavement) is a fertile source of food contamination and consequent disease. Filth of all sorts, including road detritis and the dried excreta and sputum from the common thoroughfares are constantly falling through, and settling upon the provisions and utensils. Also the necessity for artificial lighting increases the heat and impurity of the atmosphere (the usual temperature was found to be between 70 deg. and 80 deg. Fah., but while cooking is in actual process this is much higher). 219 [1907 It is a common occurrence to find Eating-houses and Restaurants without any open space at the back, every available foot of ground being built upon to provide dining accommodation; consequently in most basement kitchens the air is poisoned still more by the storage of refuse, waste fat, and pig-wash (wet vegetable refuse and broken food). In conjunction with the above facts, it should be remembered that longer hours are worked in the catering trade than in any other, and that women frequently work in these kitchens for fourteen hours per day, Sundays included. The following table shows the comparative general conditions existing in the basement, ground floor, and first and second floor kitchens, when first inspected :— Satisfactory. Unsatisfactory. Basement 41 47 Ground floor 288 143 First floor 54 8 Second floor 9 3 392 201 In Coffee-house kitchens the storage of food presents a difficult problem, owing, generally, to the want of suitable accommodation. The stairs and passages of the house are mostly used for this purpose, and meat, fish and milk (frequently in uncovered vessels) are kept all day exposed to dust and other contaminations. Some proprietors have been persuaded to provide a cupboard or safe in the open air, with proper ventilation, but where there is no yard or garden it is not easv to arrange for cool, clean storage. Furthermore, should the proprietor object to making any alteration in his arrangements there would be great difficulty, under the existing Public Health Acts, of proving a legal nuisance existed. In Fried Fish shops, the condition of the floors where frying is done, and the hoods over the furnaces have been the most troublesome. In a great many instances the floors were never cleansed (that is scrubbed), merely receiving a sprinkling of sawdust, which the accumulated greast gradually hardened into a firm surface. The ordinary methods of cleansing were quite inadequate to deal with this, and in several instances a pickaxe had to be used to break it up, but once removed and the floor subjected to frequent scrubbing, the proprietors have acknowledged the improved conditions as of benefit to themselves and their business. The foul conditions of the hoods over the frying furnace is responsible for much of the nuisance common to Fried Fish shops, as the accumulation of stale fat gives out a strong and disagreeable smell when heated by the rising steam. In every instance these have been cleansed, either at the request of the Inspector, or by the service of a notice. The difficulties of refuse disposal have already been referred to in regard to Basement Kitchens. They exist in all places where food is prepared for sale, and are greatly augmented by the use of gas fires, which prevent the rubbish being burned. On reporting this matter to you early in the summer, you caused a circular letter to be forwarded to all persons engaged in the above occupations, offering a clearance of refuse, at any time (over and above the ordinary weekly clearance), on payment of sixpence. The occupiefs of the premises in question do not appear to have availed themselves of this offer, as they object to any further payment for refuse removal than that already included in the rates, and a considerable and constant nuisance is caused by the accumulation of refuse awaiting a weekly clearance. Your Inspector would respectfully urge the pressing need of a bi-weekly clearance of refuse from all places where food is prepared for sale. Q 1907] 220 Outworkers'' premises.—The total number of names and addresses received during the year is as follows :— From employers in Islington 2,268 From the Medical Officers of other Boroughs 2,788 5,056 These figures represent the total numbers of the two half-yearly returns, viz., those made in February and August, in compliance with Sec. 107, factory and Workshop Act (1901); 2,597 names and addresses are now on the register, and of these, 1,989 are resident in Islington, an increase of 632 resident Outworkers during the period under report. Of the 1,989 resident Outworkers, as above, it should be noted that 1,749 are Homeworkers, that is, persons who work in their own homes solely for their own profit, and do not employ anyone, whereas the remaining 240 are Outworkers, persons who not only take work themselves, but employ others for purposes of gain, and are duly included in the Workshop register. The need of a distinctive title which would obviate the present frequent misunderstanding as to what constitutes a " Homeworker's" in contradistinction to an "Outworker's" premises has given rise to some very misleading statements and statistics. In Islington the conditions under which Homework is done are, taken generally, satisfactory. The Homeworkers are principally single women and widows, who form one of the most hardworking and thrifty classes of the community. To many of these, Factory life would be an impossibility; age and delicate health making the daily journey to and fro, in all weathers, a speedy cause of complete breakdown. Also the difficulty of obtaining a nourishing meal during the day which is one of the most disastrous phases of Factory life for women, should be a strong deterrent against the abolition of Homework, applying not only to the women already mentioned, but to the mothers of growing families, who are compelled to add what they can to the weekly wage. The following table shows the number of persons or families occupying one, two, or three rooms (engaged in Homework) in the Borough :— Occupying one room, for living and working ... 242 ,, two rooms ,, ,, 312 „ three ,, ,, ,, 316 No accurate statistics can be obtained for the remaining Homeworkers, as they share a house or rooms with relatives. The nature of the work done, and the number of persons engaged in each trade is shown below :— Making, repairing, etc., of wearing apparel 1,453 Lace curtains and net 1 Artificial flowers 100 Nets, other than wire 2 Furniture and upholstery 9 1'aper bags and boxes 145 Brush making 32 Stuffed toys 1 Electro plate 4 Umbrellas 2 Total 1,749 221 [1907 In the Homeworkers' premises 58 statutory defects were found, consisting generally of dirty walls and ceilings ; of these, 49 have been remedied. 52 calls were made re infectious disease on the above premises. In all these disinfection was duly carried out under the supervision of the District Inspector, but in four cases it was found necessary to acquaint the employers, through you, and stop the work fro. tem. In each instance the patient was at once removed to hospital and disinfection completed. In accordance with Sec. 107 (Factory and Workshop Act, 1891), 1,341 names and addresses of Outworkers and Homeworkers were sent to their respective districts. There is an increasing difficulty in obtaining prompt returns from employers in the Borough, and during the year under report 233 letters of reminder have had to be forwarded to them. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, (Mrs.) A. CATHERINE YOUNG. Q 2 1907] 222 INSPECTOR WEST'S REPORT. Town Hall, Upper Street, Islington, N. 2nd April, 1908. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I have much pleasure in again submitting my report to you for the year ending the 28th of December, 1907. During that time I have made 4,896 visits to various places of business, consisting of factories, workshops and workplaces in the Borough, having made 2,826 inspections and 2,070 re-inspections. The visits to the trades carried on in them were as follows:—365 factories, 1,537 workshops, 133 workplaces. 021 bakehouses, 43 restaurant kitchens, 127 outworkers' premises, and 2,070 miscellaneous. Automatic machine maker 1 Engineers 10 Art canvas stretcher 1 Farriers 31 Bakehouses 256 Furriers 16 Beer bottlers 2 Fancy brooch maker 1 Builders 12 Feather dresser 1 Blacksmiths 8 File cutter 1 Basket maker 2 Fish cleaner 1 Blind maker 3 Fish curers 2 Brush makers 2 Gun makers 2 Bamboo cane worker. 4 Glazier 1 Baking powder maker 1 Gilder (card edge) 1 Brass instrument makers 1 Glove maker 1 Confectionery makers 7 Glass embosser 1 Cycle maker 13 Harness maker 7 Cabinet makers 32 Hat shape makers 4 Condiment maker 1 Japanners 1 Coach plater 1 Leather goods makers 4 Coppersmith 1 Ladder makers 1 Camera bellows maker 1 Lath renders 2 Cardboard box makers 2 Limelight works 1 Cap maker 1 Lamp maker 1 Clay pipe maker 1 Marquetry workers Cork cutters 1 Marble masons 5 Cattle food maker 1 Metal worker 1 Coopers 3 Motor works 11 Cloth shrinkers 1 Mount maker 1 Carpenters 2 Mop maker 1 Coach painters 3 Musical string makers 2 Dairy can maker 2 Naturalist 1 Dye works 1 Overmantel maker 2 223 [1907 Optician 1 Sealing wax maker 1 Organ builders 2 Saddle tree maker 1 Pianoforte makers 41 Trunk makers 10 Provision dealers 2 Tailors 55 Plumbers 3 Tarpaulin maker 1 Picture frame makers 4 Tinsmiths 2 Perambulator makers 6 Ticket writers 4 Photographers 8 Tea sifters 2 Rag sorters 4 Undertakers 3 Rubber merchants 2 Umbrella maker 2 Scale makers 2 Umbrella stick maker 1 Shoemakers 129 Upholsterers 11 Stove makers 2 Wheelwrights 39 Scientific instrument makers 6 Wood choppers 5 Shop fitter 1 Watchmakers, etc 11 Sign maker 1 Wire workers 2 Scene painter 1 Wood letter maker 1 Sign writers 2 Wreath case maker 1 Soap maker 1 Sundial maker 1 Total 855 Sanitary Improvements.—During the year I have served 282 notices for the abatement of nuisances, 335 workshops have been cleansed and limewhited. Thirty-three w.c.'s have been provided (21 for males and 12 for females) at various factories and workshops, whilst 496 other improvements were carried out under my supervision. Bakehouses.—I have paid 621 visits to bakehouses, and it is very pleasing to state that they are being kept in much better condition than in the past, although in a few cases, where lineu has been hung up to dry in the bakehouse, 1 have reported to you and caused letters to be sent remonstrating with the occupiers for doing so. I may also mention that out of a total of 256, 209 are in use, 12 temporarily empty, and 35 underground bakehouses not used, although they have to be visited to see that there is no infringement of the Act relating to them. 1 have also reported through you to H.M. Inspector of Factories, as required by Section 27 of the Public Health Act, 1891, the addresses of 68 workshops where young persons under the age of 18 years were employed, and where the abstract of the Factory Act was not affixed. Register.—During the year 160 workshops, containing 292 workrooms, have been measured and added to the Register, whilst 141 workshops, containing 242 workrooms, have been removed, thus making a total of 855 workshops, containing 1,272 workrooms and 43 outworkers' premises on the register. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, GEORGE WEST, Sanitary Inspector of Workshops, &c. 1907] 224 INSPECTION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. Under the new by-laws there is no provision for the keeping of a register, because every house that is let out as described the by-laws quoted below is subject to them. At the time they were drawn up the Council, as represented by its Public Health Committee, made a strong representation to the Local Government Board with a view to their restricted application, that is to say, to those houses to which from time to time they might be applied by a resolution passed by the Council. In those days they were held in terrorem over property owners who habitually neglected their duties, and it is to their houses they are still applied, for it is felt that the universal application of the by-laws would be unfair to the tenants, and unjust to many respectable owners of property. The by-law which affects them is as follows ;— 2. In any of the following cases a lodging-house shall be exempt from the operation of these by-laws ; that is to say— (a) Where the tenant himself resides on the premises, and the sub-letting by such tenant is to not more than one lodger. (b) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying not more than one room, and exclusive of any charge for the use by the lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of not less than four shillings and sixpence per week, and such room is occupied by not more than two persons. (c) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying not more than one room, and inclusive of any charge for the use by the lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of not less than six shillings per week, and such room is occupied by not more than two persons. (d) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying two or more rooms, and exclusive of any charge for the use by the lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of not less than seven shillings and sixpence per week. (e) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying two or more rooms, and inclusive of any charge for the use by the lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of not less than ten shillings per week. Nevertheless, there are some 878 houses which are systematically examined, and to these 12,236 visits were made during the year under consideration, which resulted in 2,586 nuisances being abated after the service of 1,394 notices, of which 1,244 were intimations and 150 statutory notices. The work of inspection was done by Inspectors Bridel and Hancock, the former undertaking the work of the Northern district, and the latter the Southern district. For the purpose of these districts the borough is divided by the Great Northern Railway. 225 [1907 Nuisances Abated.—Altogether 2,586 nuisances were abated, and in abating them the following work became necessary :— Drains constructed 19 „ repaired 37 „ traps supplied to 44 W.C's., extra provided 14 ,, amended 28 „ water supply provided 157 Dustbins provided 93 „ repaired 9 Surface drains of yard constructed or relaid 30 Water supply.—Cisterns (new) provided 2 ,, Cisterns, repairs and cleansed 57 Water supply provided 4 Houses repaired 115 „ cleansed or limewhited 510 ,, ventilated 15 Overcrowding abated 82 Verminous rooms disinfected, &c. 5 1907] 226 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS.

Fourteen male inspectors are engaged on this work, to each of whom is assigned a definite though arbitrary area. Their work has been always of a most useful character, and under their supervision an enormous amount of sanitary work has been accomplished in Islington, so that, although the borough has become more congested, the death-rate not only has not increased, but has decreased very considerably since 1892. There are, however, many matters relating to domestic cleanliness and management with which they cannot deal, their sex, for one thing, being a bar to the work, which in other places is carried out by the aid of female inspectors or health visitors. Health Visitors.—Latterly, in addition to male inspectors, many boroughs and towns, and even counties have appointed health visitors, for it has been felt that there is good solid work for them to do in the homes of the poorer classes of the communities, where much ignorance prevails among the women, the wives and mothers of our race, who, owing to their early training, or rather the want of it, are often without knowledge of the rudiments of housekeeping, and consequently their homes are not kept in that cleanly and orderly state which promotes health, but rather in a condition calculated to induce disease. Such a state of affairs is hardly to be wondered at when it is recollected that in these modern days the daughters of the labouring classes are encouraged, and indeed, their inclinations lead them, to work in factories, workshops, and laundries, and to take positions in businesses: whereas formerly, girls in the same class of life became servants, entering the families of the well-to-do, where they received a training in household work and in the care and management of children, so that when they, in course of time, became wives and mothers, they at least had some, often considerable, knowledge of these very essential matters. But their own inclination was not the only factor, for undoubtedly employers seeking cheaper labour, or labour which could be better executed by women, encouraged them to engage in it, and the nation as a whole were in no wise averse to it. Consequently, there is now a growing feeling that something should be done to assist them with advice when they have become the trustees of homes of their own. Indeed the nation owes it to them in return for their services in the commercial or manufacturing life of the country and as a recompense for the time which should have been occupied in fitting them to become suitable and knowledgeable wives, possessing at least the rudiments of cooking, nursing, and housekeeping. 1907] 228 In Manchester, a society has been in existence for more than 30 years which has for its object the discovery of all these conditions which are adverse to public health, and especially the bringing within the knowledge of the mothers among the poor such information as will enable them to do their duty to their children. The poorer parts of Salford and Manchester are divided into districts, and subject to their directions, a number of health visitors, who are in part paid by the Corporation, undertake the duty of visiting every home where a child is born, with the object of educating mothers in the best methods of bringing up young children. Incidentally, and very largely, the labours of the health visitors enable them to obtain knowledge of all kinds of nuisances, those that can be dealt with by the Sanitary Inspectors are referred to them, but in addition, they teach personal and household cleanliness, and give advice and sympathy, and even practical help. On the whole, however, the work is preventative rather than remedial, for the women of the district are shown the evils of dirt and the danger of living in unhealthy dwellings. They are taught how to prevent the spread of disease, and the law which will enable them and their families to lead moral and healthy lives.'* The Manchester example has now been extensively followed, and most of the great sanitary authorities are considering the advisability of appointing health visitors as an addition to their staffs of inspectors, if they have not already done so. No doubt this will be an accomplished fact in Islington before long, because a large community such as it is must follow the lead of others in adopting approved methods to preserve the health of the people. The agency, male or female, by which this is obtained does not matter—the end is all. Inspections and Visits.—9,390 inspection of houses were made, of which 1,696 were from house to house, and these resulted in 62,203 further visits being paid. Other visits, as mentioned below, raised the total to 81,628. The following list shows some of the work on which the inspectors were engaged:— House to House Inspections 1,696 Other Inspection of Dwelling Houses - - 7,694 Re-inspections and calls made - 62,203 Visits of Inquiry re Infectious Diseases (notifiable) 2,074 „ „ (notified by the schools)5,829 * Report of the Committee on Physical Deterioration, pages 297 and 298. 229 [1907 Butchers' Shops, Stalls, etc. (Saturday nights) 6,240 Ice Cream Shops and Factories 242 Dairies and Milkshops 2,145 Stables and Yards 5,567 Manure Depots 67 Workshops—re Drains 411 Certificates under the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts 95 Water Certificates 90 Visits—re Samples of Food and Drugs under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts 582 Registered Lodging Houses 8 Smoke observations 825 Notices Served.—3,456 intimations with respect to nuisances were served by the inspectors, of which 3,338 were delivered personally and 118 by post. In 253 instances it became necessary to serve, by order of the Public Health Committee, statutory notices, of which 91 were served personally and 162 by registered post. Improvements Effected.—The subjoined list of the principal nuisances abated speaks for itself as to the character and utility of the work that has been carried out. It contrasts favourably with the record of previous years:— Houses. Dirty 509 Damp 180 Out of Repair 187 Water Closets. Foul 516 Without water supply 226 With deficient water supply 182 Improperly constructed 515 Defective 348 Stopped 101 Improperly situated 28 Insufficient external ventilation 49 Insufficient in number 64 1907] 230 Soil Pipes. Defective 126 Unventilated 125 Improperly ventilated 127 Yards. Improperly paved 496 Dirty 48 Undrained 22 Drains. Foul 49 Defective 733 Choked or stopped 194 Unventilated 247 Cesspools. Abolished Overcrowding. Abated 84 Underground Rooms. Abolished for sleeping 22 Other Nuisances 8,075 Total Nuisances 13,269 Cesspools.—These are still occasionally met with in out of the way places, and during the year 28 were found, of which 16 were abolished and 12 cleansed and disinfected. Overcrowding.—84 instances came under the notice of the district inspectors and each was abated. Many complaints as to overcrowding are received each year, but when the rooms are measured up and allowance made for children, it is very often found that the legal limit of air space has been provided, and that consequently no action can be taken. Underground Rooms.—These are now comparatively few, yet nevertheless they are occasionally discovered, so that during the year 22 instances of their illegal use came under observation, and in each instance it was prohibited. Houses closed.—It did not become necessary to close any houses. 281 [1907 Manure Depots.—Owing to the cool summer, these depots were not visited as frequently as usual. Nevertheless they were inspected on 67 occasions. So far as these places can be kept clean, they were clean, and indeed they showed an improvement on the preceding year. Compared to other similar premises of which the Medical Officer of Health has knowledge, the Islington depots are managed in an orderly manner and create the minimum of nuisance. Regent's Canal.—This canal caused no complaints, as its state, partly owing to atmospheric conditions, and partly to better management, was more satisfactory than it has been for some years. Smoke Nuisances —825 observations were made of smoke issuing from the following factory chimneys :— 60, Bingfield Street 20 and 22, York Road Great Northern Laundry, 97-101, Fonthill Road 76, Orpingley Road Betts' Factory, Elthorne Road Kelvin Dye Works, Kelvin Road 37, Mildmay Grove Caledonian Road Baths 34, York Road Mayfield Laundry, 93, Gillespie Road 123, Newington Green Road Lead Works, Southgate Road Ice Factory, North Road Poulton & Noel's Factory, Brewery Road Lorimer's Factory, Britannia Row Hornsey Road Baths 82, York Road 6, Wharfdale Road 16, Westbourne Road Glass Works, 71, Ronalds Road Water Certificates.—During the year 16 water certificates were issued by the Council under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Before these were given it became necessary for the Inspectors to make 90 visits. The granting of these certificates effects a very useful purpose, for it ensures (a) that the surface pipe shall be buried in the ground to a depth of 2 feet 6 inches ; (b) that where it passes through an open area or through cellars it shall be amply protected from frost; (c) that a draw-off tap for dietetic purposes shall be fixed to the main pipe in a suitable position, and (d) that the storage cistern shall be placed in an easily accessible position, and shall be of sufficient capacity for the requirements of the people living in the house. 232 1907] SYNOPSIS OF THE DISTRICT INSPECTORS' SANITARY WORK FROM 1891 to 1907 (17 years).

How well the removal of dust is effected in Islington may be gathered from the fact that in only 55 instances was it necessary for persons to make application for its removal, and in only 3 instances did it become the duty of the Sanitary Inspectors to draw the attention of the Dusting Department to neglect. The following statement is of interest as showing the improvement that has been effected in the removal of dust since 1891:— Applications to Remove Dust.

Paupers Relieved —Judging by the numbers relieved, the total number of persons in receipt of relief during each week of the year 1907 must have considerably increased, for the return shows an excess of 530 per week on the return of the preceding year, and of 1,968 on the weekly average of the preceding ro years. From the return given below it is apparent that every year since 1897 has shown an increase of the number of persons relieved weekly, with the solitary exception of 1906, when the return showed a decrease of 155 compared with the preceding year. Such a state of affairs is not satisfactory, as it indicates either that there is a very great slackness of work or that there is a considerable increase in the number of old people receiving relief. The average number of paupers relieved in each year since 1897 has been as follows:— 1897 6,486 per week relieved. 1898 6,635 ,, 1899 6,854 ,, 1900 6,956 ,, 1901 7,327 ,, 1902 7,668 ,, 1903 8,004 ,, 1904 8,086 ,, 1905 9,224 ,, 1906 9,069 ,, Average 7,631 ,, 1907 9,599 Indoor Paupers.—The average weekly number of indoor paupers, including adults and children, was 4,261, as contrasted with 4,189 in the preceding year, and an average of 3,597 during the decennial period 1897-1906. Outdoor Paupers.—The weekly average of outdoor paupers relieved was 5,338, as against 4,880 in 1906 and an average of 4,034 in the preceding 10 years. Of these, 3,556 were adults and 1,782 children under 16 years of age. Vagrants.—The average weekly number of vagrants relieved increased from 12 in 1906 to 75 in the year under discussion, or the considerable increase of 63 per week. The average number during the preceding 10 years was 25. Children Boarded Out.—The weekly average of children boarded out at the expense of the Board of Guardians was 135, which is an increase of 1 as compared with the return of the year 1906 and of 122 on the return of the 10 years 1897-1906. 240 1907] Table CXXVI.

FOOD. INSPECTION OF FOOD and THE PLACES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED. THE ADULTERATION OF FOOD AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ADULTERATION ACTS. WATER SUPPLY. 246 1907] Inspection of Food.—The inspection of food is naturally one of the most important duties which devolves on the Public Health Department of the Council, and the work is generally delegated to an Inspector specially appointed for the purpose, particularly with respect to what is commonly known as butchers' meat. At the same time, the other Inspectors are expected if they see any unsound food to seize it, and in the case of food supposed to be diseased, to detain it until they have called in either the special Inspector or the Medical Officer of Health. The reason for this differentiation in their action between diseased and unsound meat is that it is only a specially skilled Inspector who can decide whether meat is diseased or not, whereas an unskilled Inspector can easily tell if food is unsound, the eyes and the nose being sure indicators in the latter case. Errors made by unskilled Inspectors have been the cause of their Authorities being mulct in heavy costs, and, therefore, it is necessary in the interests of the Council itself to see that no food, especially meat, shall be seized as diseased unless it be absolutely certain that it is so. This explanation is necessary because there has been the feeling that the Inspectors in Islington, other than the specially appointed Inspector, were prevented from administering the sections of the Public Health Act relating to unsound food. Unsound Food.—The total amount of food condemned during the year was 2 tons, 1 cwt., 0 qrs., 9 lbs., as compared with 2 tons, 1 cwt., 1 qr., 2 lbs., during the preceding year. The particulars are set out in the following statement. 1st Quarter. cwts. qrs. lbs.

Slaughter Houses.—There were on the register at the beginning of the year 39 slaughterhouses, of which 2 ceased to be used before its close. 2,531 visits were paid to them during the year, and their general good condition can be testified to by the Medical Officer of Health, who visited each one. In them were killed 26,674 animals, as compared with 32,994 in the preceding year. 248 1907] The returns of the last four years show that the number of animals annually slaughtered in Islington is decreasing. This is due to the fact that butchers are dealing more largely either in cattle killed at Deptford or elsewhere, or in chilled or frozen meat, especially sheep and lambs. The following figures from the returns for 1904, 1905, 1906 and 1907 are interesting, and fullv bear out the statement that has just been made:— Animals killed. 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907. Oxen 2,360 2,195 2,172 2,146 Cows 4 17 — 4 Calves 154 127 143 142 Sheep 32,973 30,686 30,668 24,380 Pigs 25 48 11 2 35,516 33,073 32,994 26,674 I have again to draw attention to the small number of cows killed in Islington, which in 1907 numbered only 4, whereas in former years the number was very large, amounting to as many as 698 in 1900, 414 in 1901, 498 in 1902, 173 in 1903, and to the numbers shown above in the remaining years to date. Inspector Wilkinson points out, and the Medical Officer of Health can support him in the statement, that the animals slaughtered in the Borough were prime, and would bear most favourable comparison with those killed in any other district in the kingdom, which shows that the proprietors of slaughterhouses, if not so numerous as 20 years ago, still continue to sell good and wholesome meat. It has sometimes been asked, how is it possible for an Inspector to see all these animals slaughtered ? The answer is that he docs not see them all slaughtered, nor if half a dozen Inspectors were employed could they do so, but by visiting the slaughterhouses at various times and as quickly as possible after slaughtering has taken place, the Inspector is able to see the largest number of the carcases. The following is a list of the licensed slaughterhouses in Islington. 249 [1907 LICENSED SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. Registered No. Name of Licensee. Situation of Premises. Condition of Licence. 119 Gayes, W.

The Inspector reports that his observations of them have been satisfactory. He also states that the meat of the animals killed within the Borough and afterwards sold therein does not represent more than 20 per cent. of the total quantity of meat that is vended, which he notes is also of good quality. Among the food discovered at places where food was sold or in course of preparation for sale, were 5 pig's heads and 6 pieces of beef which were tuberculous; also quantities of fish, oysters, rabbits, various fruits, tripe, mackerel and a turkey, all of which were destroyed in the Council's destructor or so treated by the Inspector as to pevent their use for human food. In one instance where the Inspector seized 216 tins of tinned fruit and vegetables and 24 tins of meat paste, he allowed the proprietors to destroy it themselves, but such a course of procedure did not, and could not, meet with the approval of the Public Health Committee, who have rightly given stringent orders that in every instance he must either witness the destruction of the food or so treat it that it will be impossible for it to be made use of. Cowhouses.—The cowhouses are gradually becoming less numerous in the Borough, a fact which has been more than once deplored in these reports, for it is felt that their sanitary condition in comparison with the great multitude of similar places on country farms is almost as a palace to a room in a London slum as regards cleanliness and sanitary state. During the year their number has been reduced by two, so that there are only 7 at present existing. The Medical Officer of Health visited each of them himself and can vouch for the fact that their condition was good so far as cleanliness was concerned, and also that the cows themselves were clean and showed a marked contrast to the manner in which they were kept a few years ago. The Inspector, however, states in his report that he had to complain of the dirty state of some cows in one of the cowhouses, but, as he points out, they had been newly purchased, and the condition of their buttocks and flanks was of old standing and due to their previous insanitary surroundings in some rural district. 251 [1907 The following is a list of the cowhouses in the Borough:— List of Licensed Cowhouses in the Borough of Islington.

Public Health Department. Town Hall, Upper Street, N, May 7th, 1908. To the Medical Officer of Health. Dear Sir, I have pleasure in submitting the following report on the Inspection of Slaughterhouses, Butchers' Meat, Fish, Fruit, and various foodstuffs exposed for sale or deposited for the purpose of sale, or of preparation for sale, within the Borough, and the inspection of Cowsheds and Offensive Trade Establishments, for the year ending December 28th, 1907. Slaughterhouses.—There were 39 of these on the register at the commencement of the year, one of which, situate at the rear of 12 Cloudesley Road, was demolished at the termination of the lease, whilst a second, situate at 309 Caledonian Road, did not obtain the renewal of the licence at the Annual Licensing Sessions of the London County Council, owing to its not having been used for that purpose for a period of over nine months. There are thus 37 still remaining on the register. In all, 2,531 visits have been paid to them during the year. No complaint has been received regarding the conduct or sanitary condition of any slaughterhouse, and, with the exception of some three instances, where verbal attention was called to neglect of the limewhiting regulations by your Inspector, resulting in due attention being given thereto, they have been exceptionally well conducted, and it is no exaggeration to say that the private slaughterhouses in Islington—although spread over a large area, which renders constant supervision difficult—are a credit to the licencees, and leave little to be desired from a sanitary standpoint, for they are in fact far more cleanly than many of the homes of the people. It is therefore in some respects a matter for regret that the number of animals slaughtered therein is on the decrease, owing to various causes, the principal of which is that American and Dutch meat enters more and more into competition with our own products, the former consisting of beef which has been slaughtered at the port of debarkation, or brought over in quarters in cool chambers in a chilled state, whilst the latter, consisting of some beef, but principally mutton, pork and veal, is brought over from Holland and Denmark to our dead meat market in fresh condition. Moreover, considerable quantities of home-killed meat from our own country districts also enter into competition in the same market, and these can be purchased at a price usually somewhat lower than that of animals purchased alive and killed in their own slaughterhouses. Notwithstanding that much of this dead meat is of good quality and gives satisfaction generally to the consumer, it is of necessity repeatedly handled and trucked about—often with far too little regard to the fact that it is ultimately intended for human consumption—therefore, when it is deposited in the retail shop, it has not that bright, clean, and wholesome appearance that is notable in carcases that have been removed direct from the slaughterhouse to the retail shop. Moreover, as a consequence, the latter will keep fresh, bright, and of sound condition for three days to a week longer than the former. It is not surprising then to find that it is not uncommon for butchers to purchase, say, a half-score of sheep, 253 [1907 take them home, and slaughter—after the necessary resting and fasting—and hang the carcases on the front of his shop for attraction and show for days together, whilst, owing to the very keen competition, he is at the same time cutting and selling in his shop carcases from the dead meat market in order to earn a few shillings more than would be possible from meat all of his own killing. This does not apply to all shops that have licensed slaughterhouses, for many of them only purchase dead meat as a necessary convenience in broken parts according to the requirements of their respective shops. The number of animals slaughtered during the year was as follows:— Oxen Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Total. 2,146 4 142 24,380 2 26,674 These, as a whole, were prime animals, and would compare most favourably with those killed in any district in the United Kingdom, either in private slaughterhouses or any public abattoir, both for quality and freedom from disease, which is another excellent feature in the conduct of the private slaughterhouses within the Borough. This, as you are well aware, has only been attained by a constant supervision of them, and can only be maintained in like manner, for although I do not pretend that it is possible to examine all the carcases immediately after slaughter, scattered over so large an area, every endeavour is made to adapt the visits to changing circumstances (regarding times of slaughter, etc.), and under the dual system of slaughterhouse and shop inspection, not much of the meat escapes your Inspector's notice at one time or another, consequently it is most improbable that any diseased meat would be prepared therein to risk the possibility of detection at a later stage, when the consequences to the butcher would be far more serious. Hence the reason for butchers sometimes specially calling in the Inspector to examine carcases that have been dressed during his absence, when they prove to be in an abnormal condition. It therefore gives me the utmost pleasure to report as above (more especially because this has been accomplished without friction with the trade), and that, owing tothe good feeling that exists, your Inspector is in a position to examine sufficiently into the conduct of all their respective businesses to suit all his official requirements without his presence feeling irksome to them. A perusal of Table "A" of this report shows that of the 2,146 oxen slaughtered, 8 only were known to be affected with tuberculosis, which is only 0.37 per cent., and it will also be found that only in one instance was that disease of such a generalised nature as to warrant the destruction of the entire carcase and all the organs. This, however, was a great hardship on the butcher, who willingly surrendered it for destruction when its diseased condition was clearly pointed out to him, although it had cost him £,21. Backed by the National Federation of meat Traders, the owner has since brought an action in the High Courts of Justice to recover the value of the animal from the feeder—a noted Norfolk farmer and dealer—but was unsuccessful. It will further be found that out of over 2,000 cattle killed only 4 were cows, and that of these one, or 25 per cent., was tuberculous, and that was of a localised character. Other abnormal affections which came under your Inspector's notice, concerning various animals and due to parasitic and other causes, will also be found set forth in the same table. s 2 254 1907] TABLE A.

Shop Inspection.—This includes the inspection of butchers' shops, fish shops, fruit shops, sausage factories, and other premises where foodstuffs are sold or prepared for sale, as well as stalls, barrows, etc., from which perishable foods are sold. These have received a total of 9,938 visits during the year, and the observations concerning them as a whole have been satisfactory. Although the animals killed in the private slaughterhouses within the Borough may possibly not represent more than 20 per cent. of the meat consumed, it is satisfactory to report that the meat derived from other sources is generally also of good quality. 255 [1907 There must, however, of necessity, in a population of nearly 350,000 inhabitants, be a considerable number of families who cannot afford to buy the primest meats; consequently a proportionate amount of cheaper meats are in constant demand, which is provided for principally by frozen and chilled meats, from the Argentine States, and frozen meats from Australia and New Zealand. These as a rule are of good nutritive quality, but when cut up and exposed to a higher temperature than that at which they have been preserved, the juices of the meat run out from the joints, and gives them a wet and not very tempting appearance, but prime cuts can be purchased at about 3d. to 5d. per lb. less than that of the finest home-killed meats. A large number of worn out dairy cows, bulls, etc., are annually killed at the Metropolitan Cattle Market, the meat of which is generally of very poor nutritive value, and a goodly proportion of these are condemned by the inspectors there, although very many do not on post-mortem examination manifest sufficient evidence of disease to warrant their condemnation, consequently they are passed on to supply the needs of those who cannot afford anything more expensive. Your Inspector, however, is able to report that although the Borough of Islington would be the most convenient outlet for this meat, for some reason or another very little indeed of this finds its way into the shops or on to the street stalls coming under his observation, so that not only has there been a marked improvement in the quality of meat killed in the private slaughterhouses in recent years, but also of that found in the shops and on the stalls, and whilst it may not be possible to still further raise the standard of quality to any appreciable extent, no reasonable effort will be spared to maintain it in its present satisfactory position. A glance at Table "B" of this report will show the different circumstances under which unsound foodstuffs were found during the year, and that the amount has been small in comparison to the amount of meat consumed, due in part probably to the weather of last summer not being so unfavourable for perishable goods, but mainly to the fact that under a regular systematic supervision of shops and places where foodstuffs are dealt with, very considerable quantities of meat and other goods which begin to show signs of decomposition arcknown to be regularly destroyed or so disposed of as to leave no doubt for what purpose they are intended, rather than risk any responsibility from a probable visit of the Inspector. Only two summonses were taken out under the Unsound Food Clauses of the Public Health (London) Act. In one instance a butcher had some carcascs of pigs sent up from the country, and was found exposing for sale two pigs' heads, the glands of which were diseased, and on appearing before the magistrate pleaded guilty to the charge, but denied any guilty knowledge. The magistrate, after hearing the facts, suggested that the summons should be withdrawn on payment of costs (24s.), which was agreed. A baker was summoned for having unsound potatoes on his premises for the purpose of preparation for sale in the making of bread, and was ordered six weeks imprisonment, but on an appeal being made to the magistrate, owing to family circumstances, ultimately a fine of £10 and £5 5s. costs was imposed in lieu of imprisonment. The remaining cases respectively dealt with in table "B" were only such as will occur from time to time in the best regulated districts, in accordance with atmospheric conditions, coupled with the neglect and carelessness of traders and their assistants, and in proportion to the amount of inspection exercised over them. 256 1907] TABLE B.

In two instances, in the same cowshed, your Inspector had to complain of the dirty condition of certain cows; but it is only fair to state that in each case they had been newly purchased, whilst the foul condition of their butts and flanks was of old standing, and due to their previous insanitary surroundings in some rural district, and as such cases are the rule, and not the exception, this in itself is proof of the assertion often made, that the cattle of our rural districts are not kept in a manner calculated to ensure the purity of the milk supply. One case of abnormal condition of the udder was reported to the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, and received the attention of their Veterinary Inspector. A total of 107 visits have been made, and the regulations, with certain minor exceptions, have been fairly well observed. Offensive Trade Establishments.—These comprise 3 tripe boilers, 2 gut scrapers, 1 tallow melter, and 1 knacker's yard. They have received 118 visits, which proved fairly satisfactory, and no outside complaint has been received concerning their conduct. The following is a summary of foodstuffs destroyed during the year, particulars of which appear in tables "A" and "B." Tons. cwts. qrs lbs.

WILKINSON, Meat Inspector. 259 [1907 Milkshops and Dairies.—There are now on the register as many as 532 milkshops and dairies, which are regularly visited by the district sanitary inspectors, and to which they paid 2,145 visits during the year. Many of them are really not suitable places from which to sell an article so easily contaminated as milk, but as the powers regulating them are so limited nothing can be done to prevent their use. It is to be hoped, however, that legislation, which the Government intend to introduce with respect to milk will put an end to the present state of affairs. The Medical Officer of Health's views on this subject were more fully indicated in his report for 1906. During the year the Chief Inspector (Mr. J. R. Leggatt) made an inspection of all the milkshops of the Borough and submitted the following report:— Town Hall, Upper Street, N., 10th October, 1907. To A. E. Harris, Esq., Medical Officer of Health. Dear Sir, I beg to report that I have recently inspected the whole of the Dairies and Milkshops in tae Borough. There are 41 of the former, which I found on ihe whole in a satisfactory condition. There is, however, a great tendency on the part of those engaged in the trade to overlook the necessity of thoroughly sterilizing the utensils used by dairymen for the reception, storage or delivery of milk. The regulation as to Dairies, vide "Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885," provides that "all utensils and vessels used by a dairyman for "the reception, storage, or delivery of milk shall be thorougly cleansed with "steam or scalding water as frequently as may be necessary for keeping such "utensils and vessels clean and sweet, and only clean water shall be used for "the purpose." It is quite possible to keep utensils clean and sweet, but having regard to the fact that such utensils, viz., hand cans, are frequently left at houses where infectious disease exists, it is of the utmost importance that each can should be separately scalded. I have repeatedly, both verbally and by letter, drawn attention to the manner in which the cleansing is carried out. It is not unusual to find cans being washed in water which is scarcely tepid; no doubt it was boiling in the first instance, but by a gradual process of dealing with a great number of cans, it became almost cold before the work had been completed. The arrangements for carrying out this important work was in a great many cases most unsatisfactory. The copper used for boiling the water is generally to be found in the basement, sometimes in a dark, unventilated room with unp'easant surroundings, and in a great many cases it is used for washing clothes, etc. These remarks do not apply to dairies in particular, but to milk sellers who have a round. It is pleasing to note that the majority of the dairymen avail themselves of up-to-date methods to enable them to efficiently and expeditiously carry on their business. It is, however, only by constant supervision that we can expect those engaged in the trade to be fully alive to 260 1907] their responsibilities, as in consequence of so many changes taking place amongst the employees, and in the absence of printed instructions as to the methods of scalding the cans, churns, etc,, there is a diversity of opinion on the subject. With respect to the milk shops, of which there were 530 at the date of my inspection, I found that in 39 cases the premises were either no longer used as milkshops, or that the sale of milk had been discontinued. It frequently happens that, after application for registration has been made and the applicant registered for the sale of milk, the business changes hands, and the incoming tenant continues selling milk, being nnder the impression that as the previous occupier was registered, no further action on his part is necessary. The Council recently, in accordance with the "Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885," gave public notice by advertisements in newspapers circulating in the Borough of registration being required and of the mode of registration. There is, therefore, no excuse for persons selling milk without being registered. I certainly think that if the regulations imposed a fee for registration, it would not only be the means of greater respect being shown by those persons who apply to be registered, but it would cause a great many small general shopkeepers to hesitate before they sold milk. Of the 491 milkshops, mora than one-half of them are general shops where paraffiin and other oils, candles, soap and other commodities are stored in close proximity to the counter pan or can (supplied by the dairyman). I have found in 52 instances these utensils more or less in a dirty state, and oftener than not the counter pan, not only in the milkshops, but in dairies as well, uncovered, and in several cases flies and dust were in the milk. I am glad to state, however, that in each district the Inspector has been able to persuade the purveyors to provide a cover of thin muslin or some other light material which assists in preventing the milk being contaminated in the manner I have mentioned. I am of opinion that the regulations are in need of amendment, more especially in respect of milk being sold in such places as I have referred to. It is only fair to state that of the 532 dairies and milkshops, 410 of them were free from complaint as to the condition of the utensils. I discovered that 34 new measures were required, those in use being very much worn; 56 premises needed repairs, cleaning, etc., and in 19 cases the arrangements for cleansing the cans, etc., were unsatisfactory. After each day s inspection I caused a communication to be sent to the occupier of the premises where infringements had taken place. This necessitated 135 letters being written, which I am pleased to say have had a great effect. In conclusion, I feel sure that the dairies and milkshops within the Borough will in future, with the suggestions that have been made as to cleanliness, etc., be in a much better condition. I am, Yours faithfully, James R. Leggatt, Superintendent and Chief Sanitary Inspector. 261 [1907 Bakehouses.—These have been dealt with in Part IV. of this report in connection with the administration of the Factories and Workshops Act, on which he is required to report specifically to the Secretary of State. Vide p. 200. Kitchen and Restaurants.—Eating Houses.—These have also been dealt with in part IV. of this report. Places where Ice Creams are made.—There are 230 places where ice creams are made in this borough, and they have been visited at intervals. Taken as a whole they must be considered in a fairly satisfactory state. They are kept under the supervision of the District Sanitary Inspectors, who find the persons (nearly all Italians) who make them fairly amenable to reason, although at times, owing to linguistic difficulties, it is not easy to make them understand what is wanted. The requirements have, however, been translated into Italian and have been supplied to the Public Health Department by the L.C.C., and these are given them to read and to keep. ADULTERATION OF FOOD AND DRUGS. Samples Analysed.—During the year 1,213 samples were examined, or which the Public Analyst reported 1,131 as genuine, and 82 as adulterated or sold contrary to the provisions of the Adulteration Acts. Examined. Genuine. Adulterated. Percentage Adulterated. 1st Quarter 299 279 20 6.7 2nd ,, 300 281 19 6.3 3rd „ 305 279 26 8.5 4th „ 309 292 17 5.5 1,213 1,131 82 6.7 In the third quarter only 51 samples were procured by the Food and Drugs Inspector, and unfortunately he was prevented following his duty owing to illness, and in the fourth quarter for the same reason he was unable to take any. Consequently his work was undertaken by the several district inspectors in rotation. 262 1907] The above statement shows that 67 per cent. of the samples examined were adulterated. This is the lowest percentage hitherto recorded, and contrasts with 9.3 per cent. in 1906 and 8.2 per cent. in 1905. There is no doubt that the amount of adulteration now practised in Islington, and indeed in London, is not as great as formerly. This, however, was to be expected, because year by year the authorities have made more stringent endeavours to check it, and therefore an increase in the amount would almost indicate that the attempt to grapple with it had failed. The following table shows the result of the administration of the Act in Islington since 1891. Table CXXIX.

On Weekdays 327, of which 27, or 8.2, were adulterated. At Railway Stations 120, none of which was adulterated. 264 1907] It is satisfactory to find that the adulteration of milk has decreased in Islington, although, considering that the great bulk of the milk as it arrives from the farmer is pure, it is not altogether pleasant to find that even in 1907, the year under consideration, the adulteration represented 6.7 per cent. of the samples examined, although it contrasts favourably with 11.8 percent. in 1906. During the last sixteen years 7,751 samples of milk have been exmined, of which 830 were adulterated, or 10.7 per cent. In these years the percentage has varied from 18.7 in 1892 to 6.7 in 1907. The full particulars for each year are again given, as they are undoubtedly the most important of those connected with the adulteration of food. The following is a record of the adulteration of milk in Islington since 1892:— MILK ADULTERATION. Total. Genuine. Adulterated.

These represent 14 per cent. of the articles forwarded to the Public Analyst, and of them, only 4, or 2 per cent., were adulterated, as contrasted with 2 per cent. in the preceding year, 6.7 per cent in 1905 and 9.1 per cent. in 1904. The results are very satisfactory and show that grocery businesses are now conducted with more honesty than in the old days, when sugar was sanded and similar gross frauds were perpetrated on the public.

These samples were only examined as to strength, as it is impossible, until the Royal Commission on Whiskey and Potable Spirits has reported, to examine them for the presence of silent spirit. 269 [1907 The following statement shows the samples that were examined and the results of the analyses.

Inasmuch as this drug is very largely used in the summer months in cases of diarrhoea, it becomes of grave importance that it should be of full strength. With regard to the 3 tartaric acids, it was found that they contained a very infinitesimal amount of lead, which was below the standard adopted by traders and analysts and sanctioned by the Local Government Board.
