To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick, Mr Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. I have the honour to present the 30th Annual Report on the health of the people of Brentford and Chiswick The health of the population in general continued to be good, and the standard of hygiene maintained at a satisfactory level- Work progressed, though slowly, in the demolition of slum dwellings and the provision of better sanitary facilities for those sections of the population living in conditions where such facilities were below modern standards. There were no major outbreaks of infectious disease of a serious nature, but measles notifications were numerous A slight rise occurred in the Death Rate., the principal causes of death being Circulatory Diseases. Heart Disease and Cancer, the figures for thelatter disease however being well below those for 1956. Notifications of and deaths from tuberculosis were both lower in 1957, there were no cases of diphtheria and two cases only of confirmed paralytic poliomyelitis The Birth Rate fell, but the number of infants born prematurely showed a considerable rise More than twice the number of infants were born prematurely in 1957 than in 1950. This figure is however, offset by a reduction in infant deaths and stillbirths, so there seems as yet no cause for alarm. The County Council scheme for vacciration against poliomyelitis began to develop during 1957, unfortunately this was accompanied by a fall in the numbers obtaining protection against diphtheria and a fall in infant vaccinations. Vaccination against tuberculosis is now being offered to 13 year old children in the schools - to protect them against the breakdowns frequently associated with entry into adult living and occupations in the adolescent period. The Mass X-Ray Unit visited the Borough for several weeks during 1957 but the numbers attending for examination were very small compared with those for former visits of those attending 2.3 per thousand were found to be tuberculous a similar figure to that obtained on the last survey, Welfare work continued to expand, particularly for the aged and chronic sick and the demand for meals for housebound old people continued to grow. Atmospheric Pollution,, whilenota major problem in Brentford and Chiswick, continued to be kept under observation, The coming into operation of the Clean Air Act brought the question of the formation of smoke control areas into the deliberations of the Borough Council. For various items of information in this report I am much indebted to a number of persons, listed overleaf, and offer them sincere thanks. -7- My thanks are also due to the Chief Public Health Inspector the Chief Clerk and all the Department Staff without whose loyal co-operation public health work would be less effective and this Report less satisfactory I am Your Worship Ladies and Gentlemen Your obedient Servant Margant G.

The proportion of open space to the total area of the Borough is approximately 25% a very reasonable proportion for an urban area. The residents of the Borough areof mixed categories including professional and clerical people of all grades, artisans, factory workers etc. and the types of dwellings vary from flatted houses and cottages to large detached residences in their own surrounding grounds. The amount of slum property is not considerable and progress is now being made with the demolition of houses which are no longer fit for human habitation. The rehousing of the tenants in council houses. details concerning assessment of slum dwellings. demolition and the building of new houses are supplied later in this Report. In the 1956 Annual Report it was possible to state that the number of known cases of overcrowding had diminished, and this can again be said in the present Report. There was a considerable increase in the number of new houses built by the Council and a slight rise in the number built by private enterprise in the Borough during 1957 but as the new houses built by the Council were urgently required for rehousing of tenants from slum clearance areas, no effect was 9 obtained from this on the overcrowded families waiting list. The employment figures at the end of 1957 show that there was still a considerable pool of work available and a very low figure of unemployed persons. On 9th December there were 182 unemployed altogether, of which 140 were men and 42 women, This compares with 125 men and 59 women unemployed at the end of December, 1956, and 71 men and 44 women unemployed at the end of 1955. On 4th December, 1957, the number of jobs vacant totalled 463 of which 210 were for men and 253 were for women. Since a considerable proportion of these unemployed persons were probably in the course of changing work, the figures indicate that a condition of full employment existed in the Borough up to the end of the year.

Total number of persons using baths in 1957 91,981 Average number per day 657 Maximum number using baths on one day 4,492 10 The figures for use of the swimming baths give a good indication of the type of weather prevalent during the summer months,, and it can be seen that the use in 1957 was heavy, particularly in the open air pools where there was an increase over the previous year of approximately 50%, The summer of 1957 although a fairly dry one was not outstandingly sunny, however and it seems likely that in the event of a long hot summer, the increasing use of the swimming facilities may lead to overcrowding of the pools Swimming is becoming increasingly popular as a recreation and is to be encouraged for its health giving qualities. The fact that the river, which is so near, cannot be considered ideal for bathing nowadays because of the pollution from upstream probably means that more and more persons are deflected to municipal pools for their swimming. The purification of the water of these pools is by intermittent chlorination and the amount of free chloride aimed at is 0 6 parts per million. Water samples are taken daily throughout the season. Early in July, a breakdown in one of the motors operating the filtration plant at the open air swimming pools resulted in some pollution of the bath water This breakdown occurred during a very hot spell of weather and emergency action had to be taken to render the pools fit for the heavy use required of them during that period. Fortunately the necessary repairs were quickly carried out. Following this breakdown, in addition to chemical sampling, bacteriological sampling was undertaken both at the Chiswick Pools and at the Brentford Baths, and the results showed the water completely sterile, Paddling Pools - Duke's Meadows:- Area (2 pools each 60'x 60' 7. 200 sq ft Depth 6" to 1' in middle These paddling pools are filled daily from the mains supply and ½ pint of Chloros is added at each filling They are open from approximately 1st April to 30th September each year, according to weather condition Other Facilities in the Borough for Open Air Recreation Privately owned open spaces and sports grounds 111.71 acres Council owned open spaces and sports grounds leased to private clubs etc 67.94 " School playing fields 50.50 " Gunnersbury Park (owned jointly by Acton, Brentford & Chiswick and Ealing Councils) 186.00 " Public Baths and Washhouses Brentford:- In Clifden Road, Brentford, the Council maintains premises containing 21 slipper baths, 14 for men, and 7 for women. The total number using the baths during 1957 was 24 738 persons Chiswick:- In Belmont Road Chiswick, the Council maintains premises containing 31 11 slipper baths. 22 for men and 9 for women In addition 2 hip baths are available particularly for the use of elderly persons. The total number using the baths during 1957 was 42,269 persons. In these premises are also 30 washing compartments comprising 30 coppers, a rinsing section 30 drying horses, hot air drying compartments and 2 mangling machines. Ratepayers are entitled to use these washing facilities at a small charge of 6d per hour, and during 1957, 2,055 persons took advantage of the service. 12 VITAL STATISTICS, 1957 Live Births Total Male Female Legitimate 741 383 358 Birth Rate per 1,000 of Illegitimate 55 28 27 the estimated resident TOTAL 79 6 411 385 population - 13.80 Stillbirths Total Male Pemale Legitimate 11 7 4 Rate per 1,000 total Illegitimate 2 1 1 (live and still) Births TOTAL 13 8 5 - 16.07 Deaths Total Male Pemale 627 335 29 2 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 10.87 Deaths from Puerperal Causes Puerperal Sepsis Rate per 1,000 total Other Puerperal Causes (live and still) Births - Nil.

The ages of these cases were:- Males: 12. 30, 48, 86 Females: 67, 84 Pour of these died as a result of accidents within the Borough. In all, 10 persons, including residents of other, places, died as a result of road accidents occurring in Brentford and Chiswick, 3 motor-cyclists, 5 motor car passengers, 1 pedal cyclist, 1 pedestrian,, One child died on the roads of the Borough during 1957, 15 Birth Rate The Birth Rate fell from 14. 13 in 1956 to 13.80 in 1957, To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole, the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. This, then gives a comparative birth rate of 12.97 compared with 16.1 for England and Wales as a whole. INFANT MORTALITY During 1957 the number of live births recorded was 796, 741 legitimate and 55 illegitimate. There were 13 still births, 8 male and 5 female, There were 13 deaths of infants under 1 year of age, as compared with 15 in 1956, 10 in 1955 and 21 in 1954, giving an infant mortality rate of 16.33 for 1957. The local figure compares with an infant mortality rate of 23.0 for England and Wales. The graph on page 17 shows the progress of Infant Mortality since the beginning of the century. The number of premature infants born in 1957 was 68, including premature stillbirths Of the 60 premature infants born alive, 6 were born at home, all of whom survived to the end of one month 54 were born in hospital, of whom 48 survived to the end of one month. The percentage of premature infants to total births (live and still) is 8.4 Thus an improved stillbirth figure i.e from 19 in 1956 to 13 in 1957 is offset by the increase in the number of premature births since the premature infant is at greater risk for at least part of its first year of existence The following figures show the percentages of premature infants to total births (live and still) since 1950. 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 3.3 4.5 5.6 4.9 6.0 6.9 6.4 8.4 Causes of infants deaths are shown in Tablfe II on page 61. MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY Deaths from Puerperal Causes:- Puerperal Sepsis Nil Other Causes Nil There have been no maternal deaths in Brentford and Chiswick for the past five years, and from the year 1947 in which one was recorded, the only other occurred in 1952, During the year 82 cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified, as compared with 97 in 1956 One case occurred after home confinement, 81 were mothers confined at Chiswick Maternity Hospital 14 of the cases were residents of the Borough No deaths occurred from this cause. The definition of puerperal pyrexia for notification purposes its "any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days 'after child-birth or miscarriage:- 16 GRAPH "A" GRAPH SHOWING INFANTILE MORTALITY RATES DURING THE PERIOD 1900 - 1957 DEATHS PER 1000 BIRTHS 17 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES, CONTROL OF VERMIN AND SCABIES By the courtesy of the School Medical Officer particulars regarding the cleanliness surveys in schools have been obtained, and are as follows:- Number of children examined:- Primary Schools 12, 119 Secondary Modern Schools 4, 673 16,792 Number of children requiring treatment 134 Number of children in respect of whom cleansing notices were issued 91 Number of children cleansed by Local Health Authority 58 There was a rise in the number of children found to be infested with head lice, from 106 in 1956 to 134 in 1957 These figures are not satisfactoryas. although the total number examined was 1,567 less than in 1956, there was an increase in the number of infested children from 106 to 134. The number requiring cleansing notices rose from 72 to 91 and the number of children compulsorily cleansed rose from 48 to 58. This figure has risen every year since 1953, the figures being as follows:- 25 in 1953, 29 in 1954, 37 in 1955. 48 in 1956, 58 in 1957. By arrangement with the Medical Officer of Health of Hammersmith, persons requiring cleansing because of infestation with scabies or vermin, can be treated at the Hammersmith Cleansing Station, During 1957, six persons were referred for cleansing, five for scabies infestation and one for verminous infestation. All of these cases were cleared quickly. INFECTIOUS DISEASE In the year 1957 there was a marked increase in the incidence of infectious disease. This was due mainly to the rise in measles notifications. Measles is a disease showing a marked biennial fluctuation and the current year was the year of high incidence. The up and down nature of this disease can be observed from the following table of notifications of this disease during the past ten years. 19 48 19 49 1950 19 51 *1952 19 53 1954 19 55 19 56 1957 335 511 269 863 4 *3 810 47 659 107 773 Poliomyelitis 6 notifications of poliomyelitis were received during the year, and 2 cases were confirmed as paralytic poliomyelitis. 18 Poliomyelitis Statistics since 1949 Confirmed cases Died Still making progress Condition stationary Ful1y recovered 1949 4 - - 1 3 1950 9 - - 3 * 6 1951 - - - - - 1952 9 2 - 2 * 5 1953 6 1 - - 5 1954 3 - 1 - 2 1955 5 - 1 2 2 1956 2 - - - 2 1957 2 - 2 - - * 1 now left district It can be seen from these figures that of 40 confirmed cases of paralytic poliomyelitis occurring during the past 9 years, 25 have made a complete recovery with full power and normal movement of all muscles. The scheme for inoculation of children against poliomyelitis inaugurated by Middlesex County Health Department in 1956, was expanded considerably during 1957 during which year 1,317 completed a course of vaccination. erreceived two injections at an interval of 3 weeks. 190 had received two injections during the previous year, making a total of 1,507 inoculated by the end of 1957. As the incidence of poliomyelitis has been so very small in this borough, it is likely to be many years before it can be fairly decided that vaccination has been of value, though it may be possible to prove something on the national figures in a shorter space of time. Another thing to be discovered is the length of time which immunity lasts, if in fact immunity has been created. When and if cases of poliomyelitis occur, it will be important to ascertain whether and when any immunisation was carried out. Puerperal Pyrexia Although the number of notifications of Puerperal Pyrexia was high i.e. 82 as compared with 97 in the previous year, this is not an alarming figure, but really an indication that more satisfactory notification is being carried out, since it is not unusual for slight rises of temperature to occur in the early days after confinement, and these are statutorily notifiable to the Medical Officer of Health, though not always notified. The majority of the notifications were from Chiswick Maternity Hospital the staff of which had become very alive to the importance of this matter following an outbreak of real infection-vwith Group A Streptococcus in 1956. There was no incident of this nature in 1957. 19 Smallpox During the year no cases of smallpox occurred in the Borough nor were there any contacts of confirmed cases Notification of smallpox contacts is always received as soon as. or before they enter the district In April there was a small outbreak of smallpox in Middlesex and information was received in the department regularly as to the progress of the incident No contacts from' this Borough were ever traced. In July the patient of a General Practitioner in the Borough was found to have a severe illness which was suspect, The case was visited and a tentative diagnosis of chicken pox made, but to make sure bacteriological investigation was done, and a negative result obtained. The case was confirmed as very severe chicken pox. Vaccination against Smallpox The following information regarding vaccination against smallpox carried out in-the Borough during 1957 has -been supplied by the Area Medical Officer. Number of persons who during the year were Age groups Total Under 1 1 2 - 4 5-14 15 & over vaccinated for first time 337 23 15 29 26 430 re-vaccinated - - 5 19 150 174 Total 337 23 20 48 176 604 Total number of first vaccinations 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 298 373 548 487 438 418 430 Although there was a slight rise in the total number of first vaccinations during 1957 the really important figure, i e first vaccinations of infants under one year old, showed a further decline This fall has been noticed every year for several years i e. in 1953 - 55% of infants under one year of age were vaccinated, 1954 - 50%. 1955 - 47 5% 1956 - 43.7%. 1957 - 42.3%. It was expected that the occurrence of smallpox within 10 miles of the Borough might have resulted in an increasing demand for vaccination, but it seems that people are not able to appreciate the risk and the fact that infant vaccination-provides a good background for those who may require vaccination in school or adult life, yet this becdmes increasingly more necessary as the world becomes a smaller place through the availability of air travel to distant places. Arise of 55% in the number of adult re-vaccinations may indicate some awareness that smallpox was present in the County, but the majority of these adult vaccinations are for persons emigrating to countries where vaccination Is a compulsory requirement before entry is permitted, 20 Scarlet Fever There was again a reduction in the namber of cases of scarlet fever notified and confirmed as such, the figures being 24 in 1957 as compared with 46 in 1956. 17 of these cases were admitted to hospital In two instances a second case occurred in the household in which a previous case had been notified and three cases occurred in one family. All the first cases in these incidents had been admitted to hospital so the infection must have occurred simultaneously, i.e. no new case was occasioned by poor isolation at home Diphtheria No cases of diphtheria occurred during the year The last confirmed case of diphtheria in the Borough occurred in 1948 Information concerning immunisation against diphtheria in the Borough, during 1957 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer, and is as follows:- Number of children wh o Age Total Under 1 l 2-4 5-14 completed a full course of primary immunisation 277 111 46 5 439 received rein fore ing injections - - 65 49 114 Number of children at 31.12. 57 who had completed a course of diphtheria immunisation at any time before that date (i e. at any time since 1. 1.43).

On the other hand, last year this figure of 73% was considered to be below the safety margin for community protection, which has been laid down as 75% There was a very severe drop in the number of children receiving reinforcing injections from 348 in 1956 to 114 in 1957, and much of the reason for this must have been the demand for anti-poliomyelitis vaccination This question of vaccination priorities is a serious one as diphtheria is still dangerous i e, in Ireland in 1956 there were 12 deaths from diphtheria in Dublin and 211 cases notified This in one city alone and very close to this country while in the whole of England and Wales the total number of deaths frpm poliomyelitis was 114 in the same year. Out of a Dublin population of approximately 584,000, 12 died from diphtheria, i, e one in 48 000 while in England and Wales with a population of 44 600; 000 114 died from poliomyelitis i e. one in approximately 400 000 Both diseases can cause lifelong disability and even in this country during the year under consideration 1956 there were eight deaths from diphtheria a figure which rose to 13 in 1957 Whooping Cough 65 cases of whooping cough occurred in 1957 No deaths occurred from this disease, Food Poisoning Only four notifications of food poisoning were received during the year. The organism identified in one of these cases was Salmonella typhi-murium but no bacterial origin was ascertained in the other cases although specific foods were blamed by the patients in some cases It was not possible however to obtain specimens of such food for bacteriological examination. There were three outbreaks details of which were ascertained other than by notification One outbreak occurred in a factory canteen within the Borough, and 22 persons were affected out of a total of 75 persons at risk The illness was mild, and all patients except one had recovered by the day after onset No bacterial origin however was ascertained in any case Of the other two outbreaks one occurred amongst members of a coach party who consumedameal within the Borough 34 persons in this instance were affected out of a total of 36 at risk, and the organism identified in three cases was Clostridium welchii The remaining outbreak affected so far as could be ascertained 6 persons employed in a factory outside the Borough who had, however, consumed a meal within the Borough, Faeces specimens were obtained from all persons but no bacterial origin was discovered Specimens of suspect food were not available for investigation in any of these outbreaks Dysentery Seven persons were notified as suffering from dysentery one case was subsequently not confirmed In the other six specimens.taken after notification were negative for dysentery organisms In addition specimens of faeces were obtained from all contacts of these cases, 22 Tuberculosis The number of notifications of tuberculosis in 1957 was 78 as compared with 95 in the previous year, the pulmonary cases amounting to 76 and the non-pulmonary to 2. The number of deaths from this disease was four as compared with six in 1956, seven in 1955 and four in 1954 The figure of 78 notifications includes 29 inward transfers i. e.. cases notified because they had removed into the borough but who had previously contracted the disease elsewhere.,. This leaves a total of 49 new cases of tuberculosis occurring within the borough, and this compares with a figure of 59 in 1956. Therefore it can be seen that the total notification rate has fallen and the total number of cases occurring within the borough has also fallen. The figures create a new low record for notifications in Brentford and Chiswick and the number of deaths i.e. 4, although not a low record, equals the lowest figure ever obtained before, which was in the year 1954 Facilities for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis as well as prevention and after care are provided by the Hounslow Chest Clinic, and home visiting is carried out by Health Visitors attached to this Clinic. They are also responsible for the examination of contacts and for the B C G. inoculation for the prevention of tuberculosis B.C.G. inoculation is now offered to all the Mantoux negative, i. e. susceptible contacts of newly discovered tuberculosis cases; 49 residing in this Borough were inoculated during 1957 A prominent part in the treatment is played by domiciliary chemo-therapy (i e. treatment with suitable drugs or injections given at home) on the recommendation of the Chest Physician with the aid of the Home Nurses (formerly District Nurses) provided by the Middlesex County Council. Apart from institutional treatment provided by the local Hospital Management Committees of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in General Hospitals and in Chest Hospitals, there is also a Middlesex County Council Hostel for chronic ambulant male tuberculous patients Facilities for convalescence, rehabilitation and training are provided by the Middlesex County Council and the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. The social side of the treatment and prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis is dealt with by the Welfare Department of the Hounslow Chest Clinic. Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial During 1957 the Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial continued. This investigation began in 1951. its object being to determine the value of tuberculosis vaccines when used on a mass scale in this country Twenty-two North London boroughs, including Brentford and Chiswick, and areas in the Midlands and North of England are co-operating with the Medical Research Council in the investigation During 1951/52 pupils aged 14 in Secondary Modern Schools were invited to join the scheme., and 60,000 children eventually took part. Of these approximately 200 at present live in Brentford and Chiswick. All the children had a chest X-ray and were given a skin test to decide whether or not they were eligible for vaccination A proportion of these who were eligible were given either B C. G or vole bacillus vaccine. Since then it has been the task of those administering the scheme to keep in touch with all the participants to find out 23 if the protection conferred by the vaccines is sufficient to make mass vaccination worth while. One of the ways this follow-up has been continued has been by annual visits to the homes of the participants. These visits have been carried out by health visitorson the staff of the local health authorities to obtain information about the health of the volunteers. The visits are also of great value in maintaining the interest which has been shown in the scheme by the participants. Another important aspect of the investigation has-been the provision of a routine annual chest X-ray for the participants. This examination has been done by a Medical Research Council mobile X-ray unit. Appointments are sent to the participants to attend the unit in the evenings after work. During 1957, two visits were made by the Unit to the Brentford Health Centre, Albany Road, Brentford, and of 172 young people invited, 131 attended for X-ray, that is; 76%. In addition, 17 who failed to attend the previous examination came for X-ray during 1957. The first progress report of this investigation was published in 1956. The findings provided unequivocal evidence of the value of tuberculosis vaccines in the prevention of tuberculosis in young people for a 4-year period after vaccination. As a result, the many local health authorities who had not previously begun B, C.G. vaccination have been encouraged to initiate vaccination schemes. The results published in 1956, however, cover a relatively short period on which to assess the value of a preventive measure for a disease such as tuberculosis,, because the manifestations of this disease are often slow to appear., It is hoped,, therefore, to keep the young people under observation for a further period, and to continue the close co-operation in the investigation between the local health authorities and the Medical Research Co'uncil. Investigation of New Tuberculosis in the Adolescent In the Annual Report for 1953 it was reported that a scheme for the investigation of the high incidence of tuberculosis among young adults was begun. The plan was to invite children leaving school to take part in a scheme when they would be X-rayed at once and each year sent for and another X-ray carried out. These annual reviews are to be continued for 10 years from the time of the beginning of the experiment and during 1957, 266 altogether, 117 boys and 149 girls, attended for an X-ray under this scheme, i. e. 26% of the boys, and 17% of the girls. This is the fourth year of the scheme and it appears that the numbers are dropping heavily, A proportion of the boys are in the Forces and no doubt a number have removed from the district, but it is rather disappointing that the response should have fallen so much. One positive female case has now been found amongst these adolescents, the first since the survey started. B, C. G. Vaccination As a result of the findings from the tuberculosis vaccinations clinical trial that a degree of protection could be afforded by the vaccination of school children with B. C. G. a scheme was inaugurated in the County of Middlesex for the tuberculin testing and, if necessary, vaccination of school children at the age of 13, During 1957, 1,406 children were invited to take part in the scheme, 981 consents were received. These chilidren were tuberculin tested, and those found to be positive, indicating a previous infection with tuberculosis of a 24 minor or major degree at some period in their lives were referred to the Chest Clinic for thorough investigation 212 positives were so referred B CG vaccination was carried out on 550 children It can be seen from the scope of the scheme that it will take about 10 years before a significant number of school children have been examined and treated in this way, but by that time there will be a higher percentage of immunity in the adolescent population HOUSING CONDITIONS OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS NOTIFIED DURING 1957 The housing conditions of 59 of the 78 cases of tuberculosis were found to be as follows:- 58 patients lived in sufficiently satisfactory housing accommodation, 30 in flats 21 in houses 6 in lodgings or furnished rooms, and 1 in a prefabricated dwelling In no case was there overcrowding, but one case living in a flat was considered to have unsatisfactory housing conditions The housing particulars of 19 cases were not obtainable either because of removal of patients to other districts or because of resistance of patients to home visiting 4 new notifications came from homes already returning one or more cases of tuberculosis Noneof these came from houses classed as unsatisfactory or dilapidated There have been 7 notifications of tuberculosis from one house, 1 of them being submitted in 1957 and 3 notifications from another house, 1 of them being submitted in 1957 29 cases were inward transfers from other districts and, therefore, had not developed their illness while resident in Brentford and Chiswick, The position regarding cases living in unsatisfactory or overcrowded conditions, outstanding from previous years, is as follows Year Cases No where Conditions improved 1956 1 1* 1955 2 - 1954 1 - 1953 5 - 1951 1 - 1950 1 - * Houseboat now moved from district. Mass X ray Survey In November 1957 the Mass X-ray Unit returned to Brentford and Chiswick for a survey of the population. The officers of the Unit seemed to feel that in other boroughs a good response had been obtained without an appointments system and that general publicity and an open invitation to everyone to attend as and when they could, would probably bring as successful or perhaps even a more successful attendance. This did not, however, turn out to be the case in Brentford and chiswick. Although the Unit was in the borough for seven weeks, the numbers eventually X-rayed were lower than on the previous visit of the Unit which lasted a shorter time 25 The total number of persons X-rayed including general public, factory groups and certain school-leavers, was 8 788 Details of the persons making up this total are as follows:- Man Women Total Organised Groups 4,155 2„ 670 6,825 General Public 762 935 1,697 Ex School Leavers 117* 149 266 Total 5,034 3,54 8,788 The number of Brentford and Chiswicluresidents included in this total is 2,636 and during the rest of the year 324 Brentford and Chiswick residents were X-rayed during visits of the Unit to neighbouring boroughs 19 Brentford and Chiswick residents were referred to Chest Clinics for further investigation, 17 of these having been found during the Unit's visit to the borough A total of seven cases of active pulmonary tuberculosis was found, giving a rate of 2 ,3 per thousand as compared with a rate of 2.2 per thousand in the last survey in 1954 In addition, two cases of bronchial carcinoma were found, both men,. 26 GRAPH "B" GRAPH OF CASES NOTIFIED AND DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOSIS DURING THE PERIOD 1937 - 1957 NUMBER Notified Cases of Tuberculosis Deaths from Tuberculosis 27 FOOD CONTROL There was no new major legislation on food and drugs control during 1957, and the main part of the work in this section was devoted to consolidation of the improvements obtainable as a result of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, which came into force in 1956. In addition, new establishments had to be visited as there was an increase in the number of food premises in the borough. Although it is desirable that every establishment where food is sold should be visited at least once during every year, this has been difficult because of shortage of staff and because the housing surveys required for the slum clearance programme and the visits required to assess dilapidations under the provisions of the Rent Act. were both frequent and time consuming The general public is encouraged to bring to the notice of the Department complaints with regard to unsatisfactory conditions in food shops and catering establishments, and the fact that during the year the number of these complaints was small is taken to indicate that standards are slowly improving There is evidence in many shops of an increased interest in food hygiene as displayed by the greater use of wrappings for foodstuffs and the provision of screens and barriers to prevent contamination either by insects,, food handlers or the customers themselves who are very often now the worst offenders with regard to food hygiene Many customers used to wish to handle their prospective purchases to feel for quality and in the course of choosing certain articles might be picked up and rejected several times before sale This of course constituted a health hazard and was not at all desirable from the hygiene point of view. Although the requirements for washing facilities, fooc| stores etc., in the Pood Hygiene Regulations 1955 meant that some shop owners had to spend a great deal of money in order to bring their shops up to the required standards, cooperation was good and in no case was it necessary to have recourse to legal action to obtain the improvements NUMBER AND TYPE OF FOOD PREMISES IN THE BOROUGH Bakers and Confectioners 18 Butchers 42 Club Canteen 10 Confectioners (Sweets) 101 Cafes Restaurants, Dining Rooms and Snack Bars 71 Factory and Staff Canteens 52 Fishmongers 15 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 54 Grocers and Provisions and General Stores 116 Ice Cream Manufacturers 4 Public Houses and Off Licences 79 School Canteens 19 Total 581 ICE CREAM The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc ) Regulations 1947/52 Observations as laid down in these Regulations were made on the three premises where manufacture of ice cream was carried out. 8 Sampling During the year 75 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and the results obtained are as under:- Grade Ice Cream Cream Lollies Satis factory Doubt fu 1 Unsatisfactory Satis factory Doubt ful Unsatisfactory I 7 - - 2 - - II 22 - - 7 - - III - 12 1 - 6 - IV - - 12 - - 6 Totals 29 12 13 9 6 6 The proportion of samples in Grade I (12%) is slightly higher than last year when it was 10%, The above table has been compiled from results graded according to the following provisional grades setup by the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, in relation to ice cream testing:- Grade Count Faecal Co1i I Below 500 0 II 500 - 20, 000 0 III 20,000 - 100,000 0 IV over 100,000 or present Registration of Premises The total number of premises registered for the sale of ice cream in accordance with Section 16, Pood & Drugs Act, 1955 at the end of the year was as under: - Sale only 177 Manufacture and Sale 3 Storage only 1 181 PRESERVED FOODS The total number of premises registered in connection with the manufactur and/or preparation of preserved foods under Section 16 of the Food & Drugs Act 1955 at the end of the year was as under:- Sausage Manufacture 11 Sausages and pickled meat 28 Cooking of ham and other meats 2 41 21 The total number of inspections of registered food premises made during the year was 80 CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS Seventy nine visits were made to catering establishments during the year and in 15 cases it was necessary to give written or verbal intimation that work was required FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year 8 cases concerning food alleged to be unsound were received in the Department. Pour cases were substantiated, the details of which are as follows - Complaint Action taken Fly in loaf of bread Court action - £20 fine and £5. 5s. 0d. costs Dirty milk bottle No action Dirty milk bottle Court action - £10 fine and £5 5s 0d., costs Mouldy meat pie Court action - £2 fine and £1 1s 0d costs FOOD SAMPLING Food & Drugs Act, 1955 By the courtesy of the Chief Officer Public Control Department of the Middlesex Cbunty Council,, the following details of food sampling within the Borough are available Article Total sample procured Unaatisfactory Milk, various 66 1 Butter 13 - Cakes 6 - Cheese 6 2 Cream 7 - Drugs 9 - Fish and Fish Products 11 - Fruit - Fresh and Canned 11 1 Ice-Cream 4 - Liver 9 - Meat and Meat Products 17 . Peas (Canned) 8 - Preserves 2 - Sausages 3 - Vinegar 7 - Miscellaneous 25 - Totals 204 4 30 The total number of samples taken was slightly lower than during the prev ious year and the number of unsatisfactory samples was also lower The results obtained from the sampling by Middlesex County Council suggest a reasonably satisfactory standard of food sales within this borough, though that must be qualified slightly in respect of the low figure of samples taken The details of the unsatisfactory samples follow, and show that though technical offences had been committed, the foods themselves were sound and fit for consumption. The following are the details from the Chief Officer's report on the 4 unsatisfactory samples and the action taken:- Milk Only one sample of milk was found to be unsatisfactory and this was a matter of glass splinters in a bottle of milk The presence of the glass was drawn to the attention of the dairy company which had bottled the milk but the evidence as to when the glass had entered the milk was not reliable beyond dispute, and accordingly no further action could be taken in the matter. Cheese The labelling of two samples of imported cheese was objected to the substance of the fault in each case being a declaration of fat content which, in fact, was correct on the basis of calculation on the dry solids, but in each case it was expressed in such a way as likely to be understood as a percentage of the whole cheese, Complaints were made to the importers and the markings were corrected Fruit A fruiterer was prosecuted for selling Giant Prunes as Victoria plums and fined £5 He was also fined £5 for falsely describing the plums by label as "Victorias" Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953 In pursuance of their duty as officers of the food and drugs authority, officersofmy Department made 160 inspections of shops in the Borough to ensure that the Marking Orders relating to certain imported foodstuffs made under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926, were complied with 873 separate displays of meat apples, tomatoes, poultry, dried fruit and butter were examined, A firm of butchers was prosecuted in respect of each of two sales of Argentine beef not marked with an indication of origin, The firm was fined £4 and ordered to pay 3 guineas costs Otherwise, no serious infringement was disclosed, verbal cautions being given in respect of such minor infringements as were detected Ihe Labelling of Food Order, 1953 At 105 premises 582 articles of pre-packed food were examined to ensure that they bore a label which gave a clear statement of the designation of the food and in the case of compound foods, the ingredients, and also the name and address of the packer or labeller, No major infringements of this Order were discovered, minor errors of labelling were considered and dealt with. False or Misleading Descriptions As in previous years a considerable amount of work has been done in the detailed scrutiny of advertisements and the labels on pre-packed foods, Where a label or advertisement contains a false or misleading description of the food to which it relates the action taken to correct the matter is of benefit to the 31 whole County irrespective of where within the County offences may be detected, for the distribution of the advertisements and labels is common to the County as a whole. During the year under review corrective action has been secured in respect of, amongst other things, salmon with potato salad, crystallised jelly pineapple slices, pure egg mundelech, cherry juice, lime juice, imitation creamfilled biscuits, cream-filled Easter eggs, and cheese. In all these matters suitable amendments to and corrections of the offending statements were effected. In no case was it necessary to institute proceedings. Special Designated Milk No licences are issued by my Council in respect of dealer/pasteuriser or dealer/steriliser in your area. Three samples of special designated milk were taken from roundsmen in your Borough during the year and submitted for examination. They proved satisfactory. MEAT AND OTHER FOODS There are now no. slaughterhouses operating in Brentford and Chiswick FOOD CONDEMNED DURING THE YEAR, 1957 Fruit and Vegetables 9 tons Fish 8½ stone Meat and Bacon 6¾ cwts Perishable Goods 3½ cwts Tinned Goods 4,646 tins Unsound food is disposed of by incineration, tipping or for animal feeding. MILK During 1957, the following licences were issued under the Regulations mentioned:- Milk (Special Designation)(Pasteurised & Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953. Dealer's Licences 54 Supplementary Licences. 18 Milk (fecial Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 Dealer's Licences 22 Supplementary Licences. 9 BAKEHOUSES Number in district in use 7 32 BRENTFORD MARKET Brentford Market is a large wholesale market for the sale of fruit, vegetables and flowers. It covers an area of 11 to 12 acres and is under the control of the Borough Council. The Corporation employs a staff of 16 at the market and there are 450 holdings with 150 tenants. Roughly 1, 500 vehicles pass through the market every day. Modern sanitary conveniences are provided on the West side of the market and free washing facilities are available at this and other conveniences situated in the market. The Public Health Inspectors pay frequent visits to the market to confirm the maintenance of good sanitation and the Corporation employ the services of a firm of pest exterminators who pay visits to the market every six weeks to ensure that it is kept free from rodent infestation. Situated in the Market are also wholesalers who deal in groceries, tinned foods, etc., and in this connection the Public Health Inspectors visit for the condemnation of such goods as are reckoned to be unfit for human consumption. 33 HEALTH EDUCATION During the year work on the education of the general public in matters of health and hygiene continued by means of personal communication between Public Health Department Staff and individuals, talks to Associations illustrated by topical film strips, poster publicity and leaflet distribution. The main subjects on which publicity was concentrated during the year, were influenza in the Spring,, food hygiene in the Summer and Mass Radiography publicity prior to the visit of the Mass X-Ray Unit. Health education is in some ways the most important work of the department and each member of the department staff is continually educating individual members of the public with regard to the prevention of ill-health, andhow to lead full and healthy lives. By health education through conversation, discussions in groups, attendance at lectures, observation, however casual, of health publicity on hoardings, in newspapers, on the cinema, on the wireless, on television, the people are gradually coming to accept certain fundamental rules of healthy living. The persistent emphasis on the elementary desirability of good nutritious food, adequate sleep, adequate but not excessive exercise. fresh air Winter and Summer, can be seen to have had a slow penetrating quality of efficiency which seems to be demonstrated by the findings in certain surveys of school children in London and elsewhere, who are shown on the average to be taller and heavier and therefore likely to have greater resistance to disease than the average of a corresponding number of children from the same schools 20 years ago. The automatic provision of better housing, better schools, meals and milk in schools, no doubt have played their part in this increase in the stature of the generations but in themselves, without a proper use of the facilities offered and without attention to the four primary needs which have been stated, would not have produced this result, Health education must be gradual and carefully given in order to prevent resistance and revolt to what is, after all, an endeavour to change very often a whole way of living. 34 WELFARE OLD PEOPLE During 1957. 34 cases of old people in need of care and attention were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department. No patient was found to be in such conditions as to require statutory action under the National Assistance Act Details of the 34 cases are as follows - Removed to Hospital 11 Removed to Old People s Homes 2 Remained at Home (a) with Home Help whilst awaiting entry to a Home 2 (b) with District Nursing assistance and Home Help 1 (c) with Invalid Meals and Home Help 1 (d) with Home Help 6 (e) awaiting admission to a Home 2 (f) medical assistance required and obtained 1 (g) comforts provided 1 (h) no help required 6 Died at Home 1 During the year a total of 287 aged persons or aged chronic sick persons in the Borough received help from the Home Help Service and the Home Nurses dealt with 577 old people out of a total of 978 cases. These figures compare with 284 aged persons receiving help from the Home Help Service in 1956 and 575 old persons being visited by the Nurses out of a total of 1,084 cases Information supplied by the County Welfare Officer shows that during the year 32oldpeople from the Borough were admitted to Old People" s Homes through the County Welfare Department amongst them were those in special need of care and attention listed in the above table as having been removed to Old People s Homes, and four persons previously brought to our notice one in 1955 and three in 1956 The County Council has the duty under the National Assistance Act 1948. of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them, and it can do this by providing its own Homes or by arrangements with registered Voluntary Organ isations The County Council s Welfare Department administers the County Homes, and one such Home is situated in the Borough 35 Chiropody A service was maintained throughout the year by the Middlesex County Council whereby old people could have their foot defects treated at reduced cost or free of charge. Figures of the numbers taking advantage of this Service can be found on page 59 Old Folks Friendship Club This is a specially built club house opened in April 1955. for the use as a social and recreational centre of old age pensioners living in Brentford and Chiswick. The club is open Monday to Friday from 2-5 p.m. and there is a full-time organiser in attendance. The old people are enrolled as members at their first attendance, membership costs only one penny per week, and there are about 270 namesonthe register The members can visit every day, if they wish, for rest room or reading room facilities, or just to meet their friends and talk, but many social occasions are provided for them in the way of concerts, whist drives etc. A television set is installed in the lounge, and a radiogram in the concert hall. Light refreshments are available in the afternoon. This club also arranges four summer outings on which about 80 travel each time, and an annual Christmas party to which all the members are invited - the majority attend The members have formed their own Concert Party which not only performs to the other members but goes to outside places and gives free performances Through this club the members are also able to obtain information about the special services at reduced rates which are available within the Borough for them such as laundry shoe repairs and hairdressing and they can be given advice on any difficulties that occur in their private lives This is the only club premises open daily for the use of old age pensioners but there are 9 clubs meeting in different parts of the Borough once a week to which mobile old age pensioners become attached as members, for social and recreational purposes Slipper Baths Under the scheme for the provision at the reduced rates (2d per bath) of slipper baths for old people at the Public Baths Establishments 2, 204 baths were taken in Chiswick and 656 in Brentford Meals on Wheels In the 1956 report it was stated that this service, so immensely useful in maintaining the health of old people living alone was inadequate The Borough Council was Willing to pay for the provision of another van to be used by the Invalid Meals for London Association which would have doubled the service. For quite a large part of the year it was anticipated that as soon as the Invalid Meals for London Association had completed some extension to their Acton kitchens the expanded service would become available However towards the end of the year it appeared thatnotonly was it likely that the Association would not expand the service but it became evident that very soon it would not be possible to obtain meals for old people other than recent hospital discharges or persons with acute illness in other words short term supply of meals was going to be the policy in future. At the end of the year discussions were taking place amongst various persons about finding a substitute for the Association in order that meals for the old and house bound and neglected persons who are our main concern. could be pro- 36 vided with this service. In the meantime, the waiting list continued to grow although names were not freely put forward because of the known difficulty in obtaining the meals and at the end of the year amounted to 32 persons During the year 10 221 meals were provided for 60 old people Laundry for the Incontinent Aged The scheme for the provision of laundry facilities for the incontinent aged started in the autumn of 1956 was carried on throughout the year Old people in need of this service were brought to the notice of the Public Health Depart ment staff from various sources, then arrangements were made for the Department's van to call each week to collect the soiled linen deliver it to Spring Grove Laundry, and to transport the clean linen back again to the home of the old person No charge was made for the service but for each case a certificate was submitted to the Public Health Committee During the year seven old persons had been recommended for and obtained this service. Home Safety The North Thames Gas Board who in 1956 offered a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of old age pensioners living alone, continued toarrange for inspections during the year The reason for this was in order to reduce the risk of gas poisoning, a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people. The offer was to include free replacement of faulty pipes and the free repair of faulty appliances GENERAL The Superintendent of the local St John's Ambulance Association and the Divisional Director of the British Red Cross Society have kindly supplied information concerning their welfare work in the Borough St John s Ambulance Brigade (1) Attendance at sports meetings public gatherings and entertainments to render first aid if required (2) Conveyance of patients by ambulance to supplement the County Ambulance facilities.

WELFARE OF THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED The County Council is responsible, under the National Assistance Act, 1948 for the provision of welfare services for the blind and partially-sighted.

S Wright at the Local County Offices Great West Road Brentford 39 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION For part of 1957 there were three stations for the measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere by the volumetric method. The sites were (i) Brentford Baths, (ii) Public Health Department laboratory (ground floor level) and (iii) a room on the second floor of a building adjacent to the Town Hall. In addition, two deposit gauges, one at the Metropolitan Water Board Works, Kew Bridge, and the other in Chiswick House Grounds were used for the measurement of grit deposits from the atmosphere. During the year volumetric station (ii) was discontinued because all the information which could be usefully obtained by comparison of results taken at ground floor and second floor level, had been obtained. No evidence was obtained that pollution was greater at either level Each month reports of recordings and other relevant particulars were submitted to the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, for comparison with the rest of the country, and assistance was given by the officers of the Fuel Research Station when special problems arose concerning readings of results or the breakdown of equipment. Bulletins from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research were received regularly and studied in the Public Health Department so that results could be compared with those in other areas A brief summary of the year s recordings is to be found in tables XII and XIII at the end of the book: and in graphs "C" and "E" which have been prepared from these figures In 1957, the figures for sulphur dioxide both in Brentford and Chiswick were well down on those for the previous year and the figure for smoke was lower in Chiswick There was, however rapid deterioration after October and the December figures both for smoke and sulphur dioxide in both parts of the borough were well above the corresponding figures for 1956 as estimated by the Volumetric Method The results received from the deposit gauges over the whole of the year show that for most months the deposit of grit and dust was considerably greater in Brentford than in Chiswick, at least in the sites selected A curious feature of these results is that the high figures for smoke and S02 obtained by the volumetric method in November and December are not repeated in the figures for grit and dust obtained by the deposit gauge method There was no serious smog (smoke and fog) incident during 1957 Graph 'D' shows the monthly rise and fall in the pollution figures for Brentford and Chiswick, also Leeds, Central London, and Lerwick These latter places have been chosen in order to illustrate the varying amounts of pollution from a virtually smokeless atmosphere, i e Lerwick, to an industrial area, i, e Leeds. During the year 88 visits or observations were made in connection with cases in which it was alleged that atmospheric pollution was taking place. Work was carried out where necessary and advice on stoking methods given occasionally. The Clean Air Act 1956 came into operation in 1957 in part and consideration was given by the Public Health Committee to the feasibility of creating smoke control areas within the borough No decision was reached by the end of the year. -40- -41- -42- -43- -44- SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Inspections The total number of inspections and re-inspections made during the year was 4,527 and the following is a summary of these inspections.

Samples were taken at points along the stream from Wembley to Brentford High Street the two sampling points in the Borough being at Gallows Bridge and Brentford High Street The results of sampling in 1957 were unsatisfactory at the beginning of the year. There appeared to be some improvement in Spring, but after that the conditions deteriorated and subsequent reports showed fouling of the water, This apparently came from higher up the stream as no gross pollution was traced to a local source. No action was required to be taken against persons using the River Brent for unauthorised discharge of sewage or trade effluents during the year. STREET TRADING Certain prescribed areas in the district were allocated for street trading purposes, and were frequently visited to ensure that they were being maintained in good condition and in accordance with the Bye-laws.
