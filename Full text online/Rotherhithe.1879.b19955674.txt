A letter dated 1st November, 1879, having been received from Mr. George Livesey, Engineer and Secretary to the South Metropolitan Gas Light and Coke Company, stating the amalgamation of the late Surrey Consumers Gas Company with that Company having been confirmed by an Order in Council, be was instructed to inform the Vestry, that notwithstanding contracts which may have been entered into with the Vestry and the Surrey Company, and which are now in force between the Vestry and the South Metropolitan Gas Company, the Directors had resolved, provided the Vestry consent to terminate such contracts, to supply the public lamps on the same terms and conditions as those that are in force in the district of the South Metropolitan Company, those terms being £3 19s. 0d. per Lamp per annum, payable in four equal quarterly instalments, with an allowance of five per-cent. discount on 16 condition that the payment is made within one month from quarter-day ; the reduced price to take effect from Michaelmas, 1879. A Committee was appointed by the Vestry consisting of the following gentlemen, viz.: Messrs. Martin Deavin, Robert Foottit, George Lewis, Edward John Cox, John William Moore, Samuel Chafen, and John William Talbot, to consider the said proposal of the South Metropolitan Gas Light and Coke Company and report thereon.

"each, which columns, lanterns, &c. are the property of the Vestry." Under the before mentioned arrangement with the South Metropolitan Gas Company, the reduction in the price for supplying Gas to the public lamps from £4 5s. 0d. as under the old contract, to £3 9s. 0d. per lamp per annum, together with the discount allowed for prompt payment, resulted in a saving to this parish for the halt year, from Michaelmas, 1879, to Lady-day. 1880, of a sum of £104 19s. 10d. Eleven additional Gas lamps have been set up and lighted during the past year, and two lamps have been discontinued, making the total number of lamps in the parish, lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Company on 25th March, 1880, 428.

The Vestry have set aside £100 yearly to form a sinking fund to pay the same off at the expiration of the said term, the sum at present standing to such sinking fund account being £1,000. £4,000 has been paid off the Loan of £10,000, borrowed in the year 1872, of the Eagle Insurance Company, for paving the Carriageway, Deptford Lower Road, from the Surrey Commercial Dock Entrance to the Red Lion P.H., leaving £6,000 to be repaid by equal annual instalments within a period of 12 years, with interest at £5 per cent, per annum. £3,325 has been paid off the Loan of £10,000 borrowed in the year 1875 of the Atlas Assurance Company, for paving the Carriageways of Plough Road and Rotherhithe Street, from Lavender Bridge eastward, and likewise for paving the Footways of the Main Roads, leaving £6,675 to be repaid by annual instalments with interest at the rate of £4 5s. per cent. per annum. £330 has been paid off the further Loan of £2,200 borrowed in the year 1876, of the Atlas Assurance Company, for paving the Carriageway at Broadway, Paradise Street; also the Carriageway, Church Street, from Paradise Street to the entrance of Elephant Lane, leaving £1870 to be repaid by 17 equal annual instalments of £110 each, with interest at the rate of £4 5s. per cent. per annum.

Ralph Westall Walker, Reuben Henry Williams, Jun., Samuel Chafen, Lawrence Stevens, John Henry Morris, Robert Foottit, and John William Moore, with the view of obtaining full particulars as to the distribution, &c. of Mrs. Negus' Gift, and to confer with the Rector as to the expediency of obtaining an alteration of the present appropriation within the terms of Mrs. Negus' Will. The matter is under the consideration of the Committee. The Annuitant under the Will of Mr. James Kidd having died on the 18th day of January, 1879, the income of the legacy of £600 (£544 15s. 4d. £3 percent. Consols) came into the possession of the Rector and Churchwardens, and they, after deliberation, decided to dispense the Charity by offering two Scholarships tenable at St. Olave,s Grammar School, Southwark, to be competed for by Boys attending the various Church Schools in the Parish. The examination was conducted by the Rev. Andrew Johnson, Head Master of St. Olave's School, and the names of the two first scholars elected are G. J. Turpin, of 5, Silverlock Street, from the Gomm School, and W. C. Wells, of 21, Elgar Street, from Holy Trinity School. These Boys are now receiving a free education, and it is thought that in this way promising boys may have a start in life, which would otherwise be impossible for them. The following is an extract from Mr. James Kidd's Will referring to the before mentioned legacy:— "I leave and bequeath to the Rector and Churchwardens of this Parish for the "time being in trust £600 upon the condition that they pay over half-yearly the "interest thereof to my housekeeper, Susan Baldry, during her lifetime, anil after her "death the said interest to be laid out by the said Rector and Churchwardens for the "time being to the best of their judgment in rendering more accessible the means of "education to the poorer classes of this Parish." Dame Elizabeth Anne Gomm, late of No. 10, New Street, Spring Gardens, London, by her Will, dated 1st May, 1877, bequeathed as follows:— "I bequeath to my said Trustees the sum of £5,000 to be paid out of such part "of my personal estate as may by law be bequeathed for charitable purposes, upon trust, "that they my said Trustees or the survivors or survivor of them, or the executors or "administrators of such survivor shall invest the same in the Public Stocks or Funds "or Government Securities of the United Kingdom in the names of the persons who "at the time of such investment shall respectively be the Rector of Rotherhithe, in "the County of Surrey, and the Minister of the Church of St. Barnabas, at Rotherhithe, "and the Vicar of Christ Church, at Rotherhithe, aforesaid, in such manner as to pro"duce by the dividends thereof equal half-yearly sums. And I direct that the said "Stocks, Funds and Securities so to be purchased as aforesaid shall be called "The Sir "William and Lady Gomm Charity,"and the Rector of Rotherhithe aforesaid for the " time being, the Minister of the Church of St. Barnabas aforesaid for the time being, 23 "and the Vicar of Christ Church aforesaid for the time being, shall receive the dividends "of the same Stocks, Funds and Securities as the same shall become payable, and lay out "the same in such manner as they shall think most advisable for the benefit of as many old "men and women then residing in any of the several distriets of Rotherhithe aforesaid as the "amount of such dividends will reasonably permit. Provided always, and I hereby de"clare that the Rector of Rotherhithe aforesaid for the time being, the Minister of the "said Church of St. Barnabas aforesaid for the time being, and the Vicar of Christ "Church aforesaid for the time being, shall be the Trustees and Administrators of the "said Stocks. Funds and Securities to be purchased with the said sum ot £5,000 as "aforesaid, and that whenever any person who has been such Rector, Minister, or "Viear shall by death or otherwise cease to hold that position, then and in every such "case, so soon as any other person shall be appointed to be such Rector, Minister, or "Vicar as aforesaid, the same Stocks, Funds and securities shall be transferred into the "joint names of the Rector of Rotherhithe aforesaid for the time being, the Minister of "the said Church of St. Barnabas aforesaid for the time being, and the Vicar of Christ "Church aforesaid for the time being." The Charity Commissioners have approved and established a scheme for the administration of this Charity, under which the Rector of this Parish, the Vicar of St. Barnabas, and the Vicar of Christ Church and their respective successors for the time being are the Trustees of the Charity, and they are thereby directed to pay to fifteen Pensioners, being poor persons of good character, who, except in special cases, are to be approved of by the Charity Commissioners, an annual stipend of £10. The Pensioners are to be persons of not less than GO years of age, and who have not during the period of two years next preceding the date of their appointment received Poor Law relief, and who from age, ill-health, accident or infirmity are unable to maintain themselves by their own exertions with a preference for those persons who being otherwise qualified as aforesaid shall have become reduced by misfortune from better circumstances. Of the Pensioners, eight are always to be Men and seven are always to be Women, and at the date of their appointment they arc to be bona fide resident inhabitants, as to Six in the Ecelesiastical District attached or belonging to the Parish Church of St. Mary, Rotherhithe, as to Five in the Parish or Ecclesiastical District of St. Barnabas, Rotherhithe, and as to Four in the Parish or Ecclesiastical District of Christ Church, Rotherhithe. The Trustees have power to remove any Pensioner who shall be guilty of insobriety, breach of regulations, immorality, or unbecoming conduct, or shall receive Poor Law relief, or shall become otherwise disqualified from retaining his or her qualification, or the Trustees may in any such case (except that of death or disqualification) if they so think fit suspend the payment of the stipend to the Pensioner, either wholly or in part, during such time as they shall think fit. A copy of this scheme is deposited in the Vestry Offices. 24 Baths and Wash-Houses. The Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses in their first Annual Report published in October 1879, reported that upon obtaining possession of the site in the Deptford Lower-road, at the corner of the Gomm-road, they invited several well-known Architects to send in designs for the buildings, and they ultimately, in July 1879, selected the plans bearing the motto "Natator," which proved to be those of Messrs. George Elkington & Son, of 95 Cannon-street, E.C., whose estimate for the buildings amounted to £14,300, exclusive of boilers, engine, shafting and moveable machinery. The several designs were subsequently open for inspection at the Vestry Offices. Application was thereupon made to the Vestry to sanction the Commissioners borrowing a further sum of £18,500 on security of the poor rates of this Parish, but upon taking the tenders for the building works the Commissioners found that owing to the rise in materials since the receipt of the Architects estimate that sum would be insufficient, and they accordingly applied for and obtained the sanction of the Vestry to increase the amount to be borrowed to £24,500, they also applied for the approval of the Local Government Board thereto, and to the Metropolitan Board of Works to lend them the money upon the same terms as before. That the Commissioners subject to such approval being obtained, accepted the tender of Mr. William Shepherd, of 101, Bermondsey New Road, S.E., for the erection of the buildings for the sum of £19,735. The Commissioners subsequently reported that with the consent of the Local Government Board, given after public enquiry held by Samuel Joseph Smith, Esq., C.E., one of the Inspectors of the Board, they borrowed from the Metropolitan Board of Works the sum of £24,500 on security of a Mortgage of the Poor Rates of this Parish, such sum to bear interest at the rate of £3 15s. per cent. per annum, and to be repaid by equal annual instalments extending over a period of 30 years, the first of such instalments to be paid on the 1st day of December, 1880. That thereupon they entered into Contracts with Mr. William Shepherd for the Building Works at the sum of £19,735, and with Messrs. J. and F. May for the Engineering and Machinery Works at the sum of £3,260, and appointed a Clerk of the Works at a salary of £3 3s. per week, possession of the ground being given to the builder on the 4th December, 1879. On the 4th November, 1879, Messrs. Daniel Serle and Thomas William Clarke (the two Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses) who retired by rotation, were re-elected to act in conjunction with Messrs. Francis John Bisley, John Bulmer, Edward James Talbot, Edward John Cox, and Lawrence Stevens, the continuing Commissioners. Miscellaneous. Application having been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works by Mr. Matthew Batten for their approval of a proposed new Road in continuation of the Goodson Road and communicating with Corbett's Lane, that Board in the usual way communicated such application to the Vestry in order that they might offer any suggestions 25 that might appear to them desirable before the Board determined the matter. The Vestry thereupon referred the matter to their General Purposes Committee, who inspected the site, and upon the Committee's report the Vestry suggested to the Metropolitan Hoard of Works that the proposed entrance of the said Goodson Road from Corbett's Lane was insufficient in width. The Vestrv subsequently received several communications from Messrs. Blake and Snow, Solicitors on behalf of Mr. Ratten, the Lessee of the ground, and Miss Baxter, the Freeholder, upon the subject, and as to whether Corbett's Lane was a public or private Road, they being of opinion that the Vestry had been guilty of negligence in allowing an encroachment to take place thereon. The Vestry were advised that Corbett's Lane was a private road, in support of which view on searching the old Minute Books of the Parish a Report was found of proceedings by Indictment taken against certain Inhabitants of the Parish of Rotherhithe in the year 1812 for not keeping Corbett's Lane in repair, and a verdict of Not Guilty was returned, as it was then proved that Corbett's Lane was private property. The following is an Fx tract from the Minutes of Vestrv, dated 29th September, 1812, above referred to:— St. Mary, Rotherhithe, 29th September, 1812. At a Vestry held this day, pursuant to notice given in our Parish Church on Sunday last, to receive the report of Messrs. Allen Dalziel and John William Luck, respecting the Indictment preferred and found against the said Inhabitants, for not repairing an alleged common Highway, leading from the boundary post on the Jamaica Level to the Saint Helena. The following Report being read in Vestry, this day, was ordered to be entered in the Vestry Minute Book. Committee Report. The Report of the Committee appointed by the Inhabitants on the 28th day of April, 1812- to assist the Churchwardens in defence of the Inhabitants against an Indictment preferred and found against the Inhabitants, for not repairing a certain (as was alleged) common and ancient King's Highway, leading from the parish of Saint Olave, in the Borough of Southwark, towards, and unto the parish of Saint Paul, Peptford, in the counties of Surrey and Kent, called Cortatt's Lane, otherwise Rogue's Lane, in the said parish, containing in length 450 yards, and in breadth three yards, and which Indictment the Churchwardens had been directed to defend. Your Committee Report that it appearing to them on enquiry, that the way in the Indictment specified, was the piece of ground leading from the boundary post at the end of Blue Anchor Lane, up to the turning leading to Gallow Wall. Your Committee caused enquiry to be made by whom the said had heretofore been repaired and kept in 26 repair, and that finding on such enquiry that the ground or way in question was claimed by the Representatives of the late Mr. William Randall, a gardener, now deceased, as their property as Tenents or Lessees of the late Rev. Thomas Hambly. They directed your Vestry Clerk to apply to the Steward of Mrs. Hambly, respecting the same and make preparations for the Trial of the Indictment. That the Indictment came on to be tried at the Sessions House, at Newington, on Monday, the 20th of July last, when your Committee having through the assistance which they received from the Steward of Mrs. Hambly, and the Representatives of the late Mr. Randall, produced and given in evidence, an ancient plan and several old deeds, proving the ground in question to be the freehold estate of Mrs. Hambly, the now Ladv of the Manor, and to be now held by the Representatives of the late Mr. Randall, under a lease to him now unexpired. The Jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty, whereby the Inhabitants were Discharged from the said Indictment. That for the better rendering the evidence produced on this trial, and enabling the Inhabitants at all future times, to Defend themselves from the repairs of the said way. The Committee has caused a short extract to be subjoined of the Deeds and evidence produced by them on the said trial, and which they obtained from the Steward of the Manor. 6th November, 32nd, Henry viii, 1541. Being letters patent Inrolled in the Remembrance Office in the Exchequer, whereby the King granted to one, John Chandler, Citizen and Goldsmith of London (amongst other things), the garden ground late in the occupation of the said Mr. Randall, by the name of Pynfolds, and a parcel of Land called the Sallow Wall and the Long Wall. 18th November, 1541. Another patent, whereby the same Lands were assigned and granted to William Traps, Esq., in fee. It also appeared by a Settlement, dated the 22nd day of January, 1674, made on the marriage of Edwards Traps, Esq., with Miss Margaret Bower, that amongst other things, the said walls were conveyed by the description of, ALL THAT piece or parcel of land, bank or wall, with the appurtenances called or known by the name of Sallow, alias Salley Wall, now or late in the occupation of Christopher Hartgrove, or his assigns, situate, lying and being in the said Parish of Saint Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey, Redderiffe, alias Rederith, alias Roderith, or either of them, extending from a house called by the name or sign of the Three Horse-shoes, on the west, all along between the ditches belonging to the grounds on each side to a Bridge at West Lane end, that lyeth over a Mill Pond there, in the occupation of Henry Grindley, miller, or his assigns, towards the east.

An original Plan, by which it appeared that all the way or road from the turnpike gate, now called Fort Place Gate, to the Bridge over the Mill Pond at West Lane, was a wall called Gallow or Sally Wall. That another Wall called the Long Wall, extended from the Boundary post near Blue Anchor Lane, round to Saint Helena Gate and to Cuckhold's point. And that another Wall called the Gaily Wall, extended from the Road leading to the Green Man Turnpike to the Long Wall. That gates were formerly at the end of such Walls. And that the same were then the freehold of Thomas Traps, Esq., then Lord of the Manor of Bermondsey. 1696. It also appeared by a recital in a Lease after mentioned, that by an indenture, dated 24th March, 1696, a lease of Pynfolds and said Walls was gran ted bv James Young and Margaret his Wife, formerly the Wife of Peter Hughes, deceased, and Thomas Trapps, to Jacob Saunders for Seventy-one Years. 22nd and 2.3rd Juno, 1713. By these deeds, the said Walls are conveyed by the same description to Edward Thurland, Esq. and Henry May. 2nd and 3rd July, 1717. By these dec's, the said Walls are conveyed to Peter Hambly, Esq., by the same description, and in a Schedule to this conveyance, a lease of the 24th June, 1696, from Thomas Trapps and James Gay and Margaret his Wife, formerly Margaret Hughes, to Jacob Saunders, for 71 years from Michaelmas, 1695, at the yearly Rent of £22, is excepted. It also appeared that the said Manor and Lands afterwards became the Estate of Mrs. Eleanor Hambly, Widow deceased, and that she by— 10th March. 1763. Indenture of this date, in consideration of the surrender of a former lease of the premises thereinafter mentioned, bearing date the 24th dav of March, 1696, made and granted by James Gay and Margaret his Wife, formerly the Wife of Peter Hughes, deceased, and Thomas Trapps to Jaeob Saunders, and since bccame vested in the said William Randall of Bermondsey, gardener. Demised the said Land called Pynfolds, and also the said several Walls for 51 years from Lady-day then next, to the late Mr. William Randall, bv the following description, ALL THAT parcel of land, meadow and pasture, formerly divided into two parcels commonly called or known by the name of the Pinfold or Pinfolds Mead, containing by estimation nine acres, be they more or less, formerly in the tenure of Charles Arthur, since that of William Smith, late of Christopher Randall, and then of 28 Margaret Randall, the Widow of the said Christopher Randall, and William Randall her son, and lyeth next beyond Stone Bridge, on the right hand leading to Redriffe, and abutting upon the Wall there on the north and the Long Wall there leading to Cuckhold's Haven on the East and the Common Sewer on the West, part of Meadow land and premises are converted into gardening ground. AND also all the Wall, commonly called or known by the name of the Sallow Wall or the Gallow Wall, leading at the one end from the Gallow to the long Wall leading to Cuckhold's Haven ; containing by estimation three hundred rods, be it more or less, situate, lying and being in the Parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey, and Redriffe, extending from a House called Three Horse Shoes, but then a private house, in the occupation of William Winter, cowkeeper, on the west, all along between ditches belonging to the ground on each side to the Gullev Hole, at West Lane end, toward the east. AND also all that the other part of all that land, bank or wall, and is extending on the south side of the said last mentioned Wall over against the house, sometime since of the Widow Horsegrave, then known by the name of the Blue Anchor, in the occupation of Thomas Flowers, all along as the said bank or wall lieth and windeth between the ditches belonging to the ground on each side, unto the gate sometime since standing and being at the east end of a certain close, called Yeoman's Croft, alias Parsley Bed, containing by estimation Eleven hundred perches in length, more or less. AND also all that messuage or Tenement erected and built in and upon a part of the first before mentioned parcel of land, meadow, and pasture, with the appurtenances then in the occupation of the said William Randall, together with all ways, passages, waters, watercourses, liberties, privileges, profits, commodities, hereditaments and appurtenances whatsoever, to the same premises or any part thereof belonging or in any wise appurtaining, TO HOLD the said messuage or tenement, banks, walls, pieces or parcels of Land, and all and singular other the premises with their and every of their appurtenances, unto the William Randall, his executors, administrators and assigns, from the feast day of Annunciation of the Blessed Yirgin Mary then next ensuing, for 51 years, at the clear yearly rent of £22 for the first four years and a half of the said term, and the rent of £30 for the residue of the said term. AND in this lease is contained a Covenant from the said William Randall, his executors, administrators and assigns, that in case he or they should carry away any of the earth or soil of and from the said demised premises or any part thereof, at any time or times during the said demise, then that he, the said William Randall, his executors, administrators or assigns, should or would pay or cause to be paid unto the said Eleanor Hambly, her heirs and assigns, the sum of Ten Shillings of lawful money of Great Brittain, for every load of earth that shall be so carried away as aforesaid, unless he or they should lay the said soil or earth upon some part of the said demised premises for the melioration thereof. This Lease as to the execution thereof by the said William Randall, is attested by Charles Scrace and E. Quinery, Clerks to Messrs. Scrace and Robson. 20 By this Lease (which appears to have been copied from the lease of 1696), it appears that the road now called the Blue Anchor Road, from the Turnpike there (near to which was the house called the Three Horse Shoes, afterwards the Cow House of Mr. Winter) to the pulley hole at West Lane end, was formerly called the Sallow alias the Sally Wall. That the lane or way extending from the boundary post near the Blue Anchor to Cuckhold's point in Rotherhithe, was called the Long Wall, and that the way leading from the Long Wall to the road near the Green Man on the Kent Road, was then, as it is at this time, called the Sallow Wall or the Gallow Wall, and by the said lease, but more particularly by the plan taken in 1696, it appears that several gates were then at the end of the said walls. That the part now called Blue Anchor-road, from the Grange-road to the Turnpike near Millpond Bridge, was made part of the Turnpike Roads, by an Act of Parliament passed in the seventh year of his present Majesty, for the repair whereof a composition in lieu of Statute Duty is paid by the Inhabitants to the Trustees of the Roads, from Dockhead to Deptford. The description in the above Lease appearing to confirm the plan of 1696, your committee have caused a fac-simile of that plan to be made. To the better notifying to the Inhabitants, that the Way, the subject of the late Indictment, is not an ancient Highway reparable by the Inhabitants, but that the same is now the Freehold of the devisees in fee, claiming under the will of the said late Reverend Thomas Hambly, Clerk, and late Lord of the Manor of Bermondsey, and Rector of the Parish Church thereof.

WILLOUGHBY, Machine Printer, 27 Deptford Lower Road, Rothermthe, S.E. 1882. REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF ROTHERHITHE ON THE SANITARY CONDITION AND VITAL STATISTICS OF THE PARISH OF ROTHERHITHE, SURREY, FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1880. BY BENJ. BROWNING, M.D., S.Sc.C.Edin., L.R.C.P.Lond., M.R.C.S.Eng,, F.C.S., &c,, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Gentlemen, In submitting to you my Annual Sanitary Report, which, for this year 1879-80, includes 53 weeks, I must ask you to remember that the "total" figures are necessarily larger than usual, though the "several rates" are corrected so as to be directly comparable with those of the average years calculated as 52 weeks, and therefore may be studied as an amplification of the statements afforded you by the Registrar General. Having last year somewhat exhaustively described our locality and its general health status, I shall now briefly recount our leading vital statistics, and request your special attention to the results of the working of certain changes and additions in the Sanitary Laws you have to administer, which recently came into force. I may state, that in common with the whole Metropolis, we experienced an increase c»f our gross mortality, while our birth rate was practically stationary. I estimate our stationary and floating population on the usual plan, as 33563, and its ratio to the inhabitants of London as about 1 to 108. 4 Table No. i. Rotherhithe Sanitary District.

The increased death-rate (2-9 pei t lousand more than that of last year) was largely due to the extremes of temperature we passed through in July, August and December, which considerably ran up our 5 infant death-rate, and the death-rate of persons beyond 60 years, as well as that of the public institutions, though we had at least our share every when, as indeed might be expected, of the scarlatina, measles and whooping cough epidemics, so prevalent in London generally during the year. The birth-rate was lower than last year's by 0'2 per thousand, and marriage-rate higher by 2.3 per thousand. The number of houses newly built and inhabited shows a steady increase, and it will toon be difficult to find a plot of ground in the parish unappropriated for building, recreation, or industrial purposes. The present average density per acre is 38.8, and the equivalent of persons to each house 6'42. Various Death Rates. The Metropolitan Death Hate was 23.4 per 1000; the lowest death rate of the "twenty-three large towns," 17.7 per 1000 (Portsmouth), and the highest 35*3 (Dublin); the mean being 23.4. The average mortality of all England was 21 per thousand, and the birth-rate 23.26 per thousand. The average Continental Death Rate was 29.3: Christiania showing the lowest ( 17.5), and St. Petersburgh the highest (40). The Indian mortality averaged 33'6 per thousand, and that of the United States 21.6 per thousand. Our death loss therefore was only .7 per thousand beyond the average for all England; 1.6 less than that for London; 13.6 less than that for Dublin ; 76 less than the Continental average; 11.9 than the Indian general rate, and almost identical with the United States' return.

Its other columns demonstrate the urgent necessity of hearty co-operation, on the part of the public with the sanitary authority, so that the now far too high 'child death-rate" may, by the stamping out of preventable disease, be reduced to nominal limits. These should not exceed 10 per cent.* But, so long as concealment of murderous ailments like small-pox, measles, whooping-cough, scarlet fever, diptheria, &c. is systematically practised by heads of families, and encouraged by advisers from whom better counsel might reasonably be expected ; whilst sufferers and convalescents from communicable disease are unblushingly parading in streets, schools, churches, recreation grounds and public conveyances/ whilst the efforts of yourselves and your officers to provide proper isolation and disinfection of such persons and their belongings are derided, reviled and defied; until, in a word, compulsory notification to the responsible public body, of all cases of illness, as well as death, is legally enforced, and non-compliance therewith rendered a penal offence; so long will almost every other one of those innocents on whose behalf against ignorance we pay a sum larger than the Crimean war tax, be needlessly suffered to die before completing the fifth year of their lives; and so long will the shortcomings of "permissive" as opposed to "compulsory " sanitary legislation be evident. * Mr. E.

The percentage of non-parishioners' deaths (largely made up of "drowned cases") was 19.3. CAUSES OF DEATH. CLASS I. —ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The deaths recorded in this class were 230 in all, 156 occurring amongst children. They were chiefly due to Measles, Scarlet Fever and Whooping Cough, though the amount of illness certified as Diphtheria was above the average, and was in almost every rase associated with defective drainage and water supply. The total Zymotic Death-rate equalled 6.7 per thousand, that from the "seven principal diseases" 5.6 per thousand; the child rate was 3 5 per thousand. A single instance of Typhus Fever and another of socalled Cholera were recorded ; no spread of either complaint took place. The enteric fever cases had caught that malady from various sources of infection extrinsic to the Parish: but the customary polluted water supply was evident in all their homes. The deaths from Diarrhoea were fewer than usual, probably diminished by the unusually low summer temperature. CLASS II.—CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. These were the causes of 142 deaths, 53 of which were registered as occurring amongst children under 3 years old. They were mostly diagnosed as Phthisis, Scrofula and Tabes Mesenterica. CLASS III.—LOCAL DISEASES. These gave 390 fatalities: 171 children under 5 years dving from them. Pulmonary diseases (excluding Consumption) caused 213 deaths; convulsive diseases of infants were credited with 62 deaths, and nearly all the remainder were assigned to brain and heart disease. The large increase from last year in the returns of pulmonary disease was no doubt caused by the prevalence of cold and wet weather throughout the greater part of the year. 10 CLASS IV.—DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASES. The Developmental Disease column containing 88 entries, 59 being those of children under 5 years, consists mainly of deaths from Premature birth, Malformations, Teething and Old Age. CLASS V.—VIOLENT DEATHS. These, as usual, were chiefly due to drowning. The geographical-industrial position of our parish, and tha apparently unavoidable accidents of domestic life amongst a working-class population, were the cause of 67 inquests being held, 41 of which were drowned cases, and 18 street and dock mishaps, the rest occurring in private houses. I must again bear testimony to the great public value of our mortuary, which is largely tenanted by those subjects for which it was specially designed ; though in the hot summer weather, I was once compelled during your vacation, to take on myself the responsibility of immediately burying a putrid corpse left there. Your Sanitary Committee subsequently approved and confirmed my action. METEOROLOGY. The weather, generally, was cold, wet and sunless. Low temperatures were noted in every month. The rainfall exceeded that of 1878 and was 1.3 inch above the average. Only 983 hours of bright sunshine were recorded at Greenwich, against 1250 hours in the preceding year. The mean temperature was 46°2, (3°3 below the average; the mean temperature of the last three winter months was 4°6 below the average. The month of December was the coldest December observed in the present century, its mean temperature being 6°7 below the average. Rain fell on 186 days out of 365. The greatest rainfall measured 4.5 inches beyond the average of the past 64 years. The mean velocity of the wind was 11*6 miles an hour, more than a mile an hour in excess of the average during the past 30 years. SANITARY WORK FOR THE YEAR. All instances of infectious disease, fatal or otherwise, coming under the notice of your officers, were inspected, and as far as possible thoroughly isolated and disinfected, and, with the co-operation of the officers of the St. Olave's Guardians, all suitable cases were placed in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. An important part of my duty was to attempt the repression of the long-continued and repeated epidemics of measles, scarlatina and whooping-cough, from which this 11 parish, in common with all London, has suffered since the commencement of the year, and some scattered cases of small-pox, enteric fever, and diphtheria required my close attention also. Great difficulty in stamping out all these is experienced, from the studious concealment from the Sanitary Authority of their existence, practised by those immediately responsible for their care; so that until a death occurs, and other persons living in or near the affected house have contracted the same infectious disease in some particular neighbourhood, and consequently it runs on unchecked for at least a time, jis was notablv exemplified at an old clothes shop in one lane, and a milk shop in another side street, in both of which fatal scarlatina broke out and spread before I could possibly take the proper steps to arrest further contagion. I need hardly say that the strongest preventive measures were always put in force by myself and the Inspector of Nuisances, to the utmost of our knowledge and power. I made the customary half-yearly inspections of the Slaughter-houses and Cowhouses, in February and September. Both these classes of buildings were in as satisfactory condition as usual, save some of the cow-houses and dairies where the arrangements of the cow-sheds, as to ventilation and drainage, was said to be improved from last year, but really altered for the worse, by the Inspectors of the Metropolitan Board of Works acting under the new regulations authorised by the 36th section of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act of 1878. You, as a sanitary authority, are powerless to prevent such alterations, however hurtful they may be; but as the Metropolitan Board has no locus standi at quarter sessions, for assenting to, or refusing, the grant or renewal of Licenses, your officers took the same steps with regard the slaughter-houses and cowshed licenses as formerly, and continue to inspect the dairies and milk-shops. In consequencc of the repeal of the Bakehouse Regulation Act, and the adoption of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1878, I inspected the bakehouses in our parish for the last time, in November. They were all then in fair order, with one exception, where a privy in the midst of the bakehouse, which I had previously reported to your Sanitary Committee, had not been removed, and under the new Act, you were again unable to interfere with this disgusting nuisance, which is still existing. I cannot learn that am proper, if any, bakehouse inspection has yet been tarried out by the officials, who alone are now empowered to look after such establishments. In January, 1 commenced to enforce, by your order, the Canal Boats Act, 1877, and took measures for regularly ascertaining what boats entering your waters were complying with it, and for arranging a system of inspection and notification of registration with other authorities. This occupied much time, and entailed lengthy correspondences, while for the first six months at least, the Act seemed a dead letter, owing to various defects in its details, notablv, a want of power for detention of an offending boat, whilst a local magisterial decision was being obtained. Since then we have registered two boats in one district, and 494 which came into it have complied with the Act, as far as registration goes; though whether they have done so as to overcrowding and the education of their children, 1 greatly doubt, but cannot ascertain, owing to the above named reason. So convinced are the School Board Authorities of the present 12 worthlessness of this measure, that until proper means are afforded myself as Inspector of Canal Boats, and their visiting officer, in our official capacities, to detain, as we think necessary, any boat or boat occupier contravening the regulations authorised by the Local Government and yourselves, they have decided to take no steps to enforce their part of the Act. I am now conferring with its originators, and trust before long to procure some amendments which will render it a workable measure. I paid much attention to several trade nuisances, particularly the various manure works and grain drying granaries, which latter, owing to the wet weather in July and August, were very active till nearly Christmas. Finding many legal delays and difficulties in dealing with the first named pests, I drew the attention of the Board of Works to them, and the officers of that body are now taking the matter in hand. On two occasions, your General Purposes Committee visited the drying granaries with me, and empowered me to make the best possible arrangement I could with the owners, to obviate the nuisance complained of. They promised to comply with my suggestions, and negotiations for that purpose are now going on between us. A long standing and most offensive nuisance at Millpond Wharf, which for many years past you have, from time to time, ineffectually attacked in law courts and otherwise, has at last been just finally suppressed by a Magistrate's order obtained by your Clerk and myself. The Mill-pond and Mill-dam have been regularly kept in order and cleansed to my satisfaction, and the only remaining black ditch in the parish, that between All Saints Church and Brandrams' field, is about to be abolished, in compliance with a requisition you empowered me to make. In concluding, I must express gratitude for the assistance received from the Yestry as a body, and my Colleagues, in the discharge of my duties. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your very obedient Servant, BENJAMIN BROWNING, M.D., S.Sc.C.Edin. Fellow of the Chemical Society, Medical Officer of Health. Rotherhithe, 1880.
