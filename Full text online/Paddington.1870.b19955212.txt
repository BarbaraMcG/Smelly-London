By Order, FRANK DETHRIDGE, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Hall; 26 th June, 1871. REPORT of the WORKS EXECUTED in the PAVING, LIGHTING, AND SEWERS DEPARTMENTS. By GEORGE F. STEVENS, surveyor. REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Vestry Hall; 29th June, 1871. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit this my Annual Report of the several Works executed and the chief business transacted in the Paving, Lighting and Sewers Departments, during the year ending Lady-day, 1871. Paving. The Footway Pavements and Water Channels in many Streets have been taken up, relaid and repaved in consequence of the increasing traffic and wear and tear caused by the formation of New Streets and Neighbourhoods in the North and West portions of the Parish, and in the Parishes thereto adjoining. Several Footways have been widened and improved, and where the surface of a few others had been worn uneven, the Flags have been taken away, and Rock Asphalte Paving, by way of experiment, substituted. 4 Various Crossings at the intersections of Streets, and several Cab Stands, have been paved with the best description of Granite Cubes. The Carriageways have, as usual, been substantially repaired, and by the aid of the (15 tons) Steam Road Roller, manufactured by Messrs. Aveling and Porter, the broken Granite has since October last been quickly and firmly compressed, and a smooth surface obtained, to the manifest saving of animal power. I believe that further time and experience will prove that the cost of maintenance of Roads rolled by this method, will be reduced. The closing of the thoroughfares for Carriage traffic, subject to the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, during the repair of the Roads, has greatly facilitated the operations of our workmen, and compared with the old system of allowing Horses and Vehicles to pass over the unfinished works, has effected a saving of time and expense in their execution. Three New Streets have been formed, and paved by the Vestry under the powers of "The Metropolis Management Acts" at the cost of Owners of Houses abutting on such Streets. Additional Streets have been completed by Owners of property at their expense, and to my satisfaction, and afterwards cleansed, watered and repaired at the cost of the Vestry, which, with the previous extent, 5 make 40 miles, 7 furlongs and 9 yards now under the control of the Vestry. The Streets have been opened in 2704 places by Gas and Water Companies and other parties, for the purpose of laying and repairing pipes, and carrying into effect certain alterations and additions to Houses and Stables. Lighting. Thirty-four additional Lamps have been erected in various Streets within the Parish, making the total number of Lamps 1648. Fifteen Lamps have been removed to new positions in order to improve the lighting of several Streets, and to accord with such footways as required widening. Buildings, Sewers and Drains. Forty-seven Notices have been given to the Vestry in accordance with the 76th Section of the Act of 1855, for the erection of 157 Buildings; namely, 1 Chapel, 1 Temporary Church, 127 Houses, and 28 Stables. The Orders of the Vestry have been served upon the Parties concerned, and Copies thereof filed at the Vestry Hall. Sixty-five Applications for the construction of Drains under the Public Roads and Footways to 79 Houses and Premises have been received, and the Works executed at the cost of Owners of Property. 6 Sewers in the undermentioned Streets and Places have been constructed by the Owners of Property at their expense, viz.:— feet. ft. in. ft. in. Shirland Road,between Saltrun Crescent and the Western boundary of the Parish 1580 run of 3.9 by 2.6 whole Brick Sewer Grittleton Road 390 „ „ ditto. Titchborne Row 35 run of ½-Brick Barrel Sewer. Dawson Place 38 „ 12-in. Pipes. Total 2043 Two hundred and twenty-two feet run of 12-in. Pipe Sewer has been constructed in Dudley Street at the expense of the Vestry. The estimated cost of the above-mentioned Sewers, together with 1 mile 1571 yards of Drain Pipes laid down to New Houses, &c. is about £2630. Two miles and 132 yards of Brick Sewers, in which the deposit varied from six to nine inches in depth, have been cleansed, and the hard deposit removed, at a cost to the Vestry of £66 : 1:6. Five side entrances, ten Ventilating Shafts, two Flushing Shafts and fifty-four Gulleys have been constructed and re-constructed, and forty-two Gulleys repaired in various parts of the Parish. Ninety-seven Gulleys have been cleansed at a cost to the Vestry of £ 11:2:1. Five hundred and thirteen distinct Works relative to the repair of Sewers and Gulleys, laying pipe 7 drains, fixing traps, cleansing, &c., have been executed at a cost of £953: 5: 11. This amount includes the sum of £378: 9: 7 received from Owners of Property, for fixing traps at outlets of existing drains, constructing Gulleys and laying drain pipes under Streets, and for the examination of House drains. In addition to the above-mentioned Works, two hundred and thirty-six complaints have been attended to, in reference to Sewers, Gulleys and Drains; of this number, sixty-three were complaints of stoppages in House drains, which were removed and the drains relieved at the expense of the Applicants.

Gentlemen, I have the honor of presenting to you my Fourth Annual Report on the Sanitary condition of the Parish. In so doing I have endeavoured to place on record those data and statistics of population and disease which I trust may be of value for some future reference. I have also ventured to allude to some of those evils which it is believed may be controlled, or entirely removed by future Sanitary Legislation, in which your efforts and co-operation are invited. According to the preliminary returns of the census, the population of Paddington, as a sub-district of Kensington, stands thus in April 1871:— Sub-Districts. Inhabited Houses. Population. Increase in 10 years. St. Mary's St. Johns 6757 5075 58,702 38,082 19,687 1,313 11,822 96,784 20,990 4 The total number of deaths in the Parish last year (ending March 28th) was 190G persons, including the deaths in St. Mary's Hospital and in the Workhouse. The general death rate was 19.6 per 1000 of the living, or about 1 in every 50 of the inhabitants. In examining the death-rate more closely, it will be seen that in the district of St. John's, the deaths of which were 631, were at the rate of 16.5 per 1000 of the population ; and in the district of St. Mary's 1275, or at the higher rate of 21.7 per 1000 of its population. The births for the year 1871 were 2687, or at the rate of 27.7 per 1000. The birth-rate of London generally is 36.44, and that of large towns 39.96, say 40 per 1000 of their population. The mortality of a district is generally supposed to be in relation to the density of population, and if we take into account other breathing creatures besides man that pollute the air, and consume its oxygen, Paddington must rank as a thickly populated part, for there are not less than 7000 horses in stables. Each horse requires for respiration, and damages in the same time, four times the amount of air required for one human being. The excreta of so many horses adds also to the sources by which atmospheric air is often tainted. The state of public health is however not seriously endangered by this large proportion of animal life in its midst, when manure is promptly removed, stables cleanly kept and well drained, and no perceptible nuisance allowed to arise. 5 Judging by the rate of mortality in large towns, sanitary progress has not been very flattering. In the largest towns of the kingdom, including now about seven millions of people, the mortality is one-third in excess of its normal proportions, and greater than it would have actually been amongst the same population living in rural districts. The deaths in cities being 26.2 per 1000, and 17.0 per 1000 in rural places. The average death-rates throughout the country generally are about 22.4 per 1000. In 1841 it was 21.59 ; in 1851 it was 21.99, and in 1861 it was 21.63. But in places where dwellings have been improved, over-crowding abated, subsoil drainage, atmospheric pollution and water supply attended to, the length of life has increased, and the death-rate has been reduced to 18 or 20 per 1000. Disease may be said to have been just kept at bay. It is much to be regretted that the Census Returns will not be, and never have been, sufficiently elaborated to give specific information of the statistics of large populated streets and places, thus affording means of comparing the vital statistics and population of these with the mansions and squares. The proportionate number of young children, and of persons at advanced ages, living in certain streets or districts, and of certain trades and conditions, are also necessary data which ought to be officially known to every Medical Officer of Health, whose function is to compare the health of one part of his district with another. These calculations must be deferred until I can procure the necessary information, which I believe may be obtained by a special application made at the Census Office. () TABLE I.

St. John 38,032 = 96,784 Zymotic Diseases. The Zymotic diseases during the year were fatal to 386 persons, being 20 per cent., or one-fifth of the deaths from all causes ; of these, one-third were from Scarlet Fever, which has been epidemic for nearly two years here, as in most parts of the Metropolis. Of the 131 deaths from Scarlet Fever, 30, 43, 42 and 16 were registered every quarter. The Small Pox epidemic commenced in January. This disease was almost unknown for four years, when 2 or 3 deaths were recorded annually. It has since prevailed in all parts of the Parish, finding its way into mansions of the rich. The 16 and 17 deaths per quarter, I am sorry to say, do not represent the true mortality, for a large number of cases were removed to the Small Pox Hospitals, and the mortality there was high. The history of the epidemic, and the various measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease, will have to be deferred until further returns are 7 obtained from the Small Pox Hospitals. Suffice it to say at present, that the early removal and isolation of cases, with thorough disinfection of rooms and articles of bedding, have been most satisfactory in preventing (except in a very few instances) the contagion from attacking second or third persons in the same house. Fever cases are very rare in the parish: out of the 36 cases of recorded deaths by fever, typhus is unknown; typhoid, relapsing and infantile fever are not common; the fever cases indeed were generally registered as complicated with some local disease. The Zymotic diseases vary but little in the average number of annual deaths.

In looking for the predisposing causes of this high mortality from consumptive diseases, we cannot but attribute much to the ill ventilation of overcrowded rooms. Many such cases of consumption have come under my notice which could not in any way be traced to an hereditary tendency, but were distinctly brought on by the continued breathing of foul atmospheric air; and where more than one 9 consumptive case has occurred in the same household, it has appeared to the ordinary observers to have been caught from the sick person; a belief entertained by many old writers—the true cause being an endemic one arising from the ill-ventilation and re-breathing of bad air in bed-rooms, shops or factories.

This is very high indeed. Last year, diseases of the respiratory organs, bronchitis and pneumonia, carried off 148, not including whooping cough, 63 more; the tubercular or wasting 10 diseases were 139, diarrhoea 71, of which 55 occurred in the three summer months of July, August, and September. Scarlet Fever killed 81, while only 3 are recorded from common fever, 7 from Small Pox, and 27 from measles. The Public Vaccination Act has been under my supervision for three years, and the very small number of deaths and attacks from Small Pox in young children during the late epidemic, in comparison with adults, shows that Vaccination has been fairly attended to. Monthly returns are obtained of those parents who either refused or neglected to have their children vaccinated; a notice given to vaccinate within 14 days has been generally responded to, but prosecutions have been carried out in some instances and fines levied. Deaths from Violent Causes. The deaths from violence amounted to 79, the larger portion of which were accidents brought to St. Mary's Hospital. Inquests were held in the parish upon 126 persons. The proportion of deaths from violence is not greater in this parish than many other town districts; but. the item is large throughout the county generally, the annual number of killed persons from accident or negligence being upwards of 2000. 20,000 would be the probable number of those who are maimed and wounded, but recovered. These accidents are chiefly from vans, carts, omnibuses, carriages, railways, and street vehicles. In London, 48 to 52 persons are killed every quarter. Inquests are held, magistrates complain, suggestions made, but nothing done to lessen the danger of rapid and careless driving in crowded streets. 11 A Registration of Disease. No progress has been made in this. My letter of July 15th, 1870, suggesting to the Secretaries of the Dispensaries in the Parish the keeping of a Register exhibiting information relative to zymotic diseases, and requesting in the event of their adopting such a system, that they would afford access to the officers of the Vestry, has met with no success. Nothing will be done until it becomes a part of future Sanitary law to have a national registration of sickness, embracing at least the diseases of the zymotic and preventible character, from hospitals, dispensaries, schools, charitable and public institutions, and from private houses. It should be compulsory and incumbent upon the medical attendants to make known to the Sanitary authorities the existence of a contagious malady. Such information is essential for the protection of public health, and need not involve any disagreeable consequences, expense or trouble. I would have sent an officer weekly to collect these statistics of fresh cases occuring in public institutions on a return which is in use, but they have in general no sufficient information, either as to the seat of the disease (the address of the patient) or the nature of the disease—being absent in the register kept. If the exact locality were but made known, the inspector of nuisances would make it part of his duty to advise or assist in removing unsanitary conditions found there. Overcrowding, and the spreading of contagious disease, cannot be effectually controlled in a Parish of 100,000 persons without this collateral assistance. 12 Over-crowding, and Reform of the dwellings of the Wage-class. Over-crowding has been abated in all instances where it can be discovered. It unfortunately happens that in many of the newly-built streets, houses which now contain four, five or more holdings or distinct families, were originally designed for one family. In these houses, provided with kitchens, parlours, drawing room, and bed rooms, each floor or single room contains often a separate tenant. The front rooms average about 2000 cubic feet, the back rooms about one-third less, 1100 to 1200. In this limited area, a man, wife, and five or six children, have occasionally to live, who, with the bedding and furniture, and cooking utensils, have scarcely standing room. What must be the state of its atmosphere at night, with closed doors and windows—and how strongly it becomes impregnated by contagion when Scarlet fever or a contagious malady breaks out, it is not difficult to imagine. Examples:—At 16 Hermitage-street, a front parlor was occupied by man, wife and four children, with 880 cubic feet space—little more than 100 each. At 19 Netley-street, nine in a family occupied the front kitchen. At 29 Hall Park, man, wife and seven children, several lying ill of fever, had 1773 cubic feet space. These latter, through the kindness of the Society for organizing Charitable Relief, were sent into the country for change of air. Before I entered office under the Vestry in 1867, a proposal was made to adopt the 35th Section of the Sanitary Act of 1866. This gives power, under 13 conditions perfectly fair and reasonable towards landlords of small property. The Vestry rejected it, I believe,from want of due appreciation and consideration of its intent and purpose, for if prudently carried out, it is one means of attacking the evils of over-crowding. Houses let and sub-let to more than one family under certain circumstances, are endangering life, and ought no longer to be without sanitary supervision. Very little hopes can be entertained of checking the progress and spread of epidemic maladies, and of reducing the high mortality in children, until a statutary law shall make it penal to let out houses deficient in what is essential for a healthy dwelling. All landlords of house property in cities who desire to let and sub-let houses to more than one family, ought to be furnished with a licence from the Surveyor or Health Officer of the district, indicating the number of persons that might safely be permitted to occupy any house or rooms. It would exonerate them from blame, and the penalty would fall upon the tenants for illegal and dangerous over-crowding. It would be easy to define what are the essential requirements for domestic and civic health in respect of any description of household accommodation, or any room of a house. Adequate means for obtaining pure water; efficient ventilation by windows, fireplace and staircase ; means for the removal of dirt, refuse, and slops ; good drainage and w.c. accommodation ; a receptacle for food and fuel—are all essential requisites of a healthy dwelling. No house ought to be certified as fit for habitation until made so, and others not certified ought to be kept closed as unfit for human habitation No reform in the dwellings of the labouring 14 classes can be effected without this apparently harsh but wholesome interference with the rights of property. The dreadful havoc committed annually by a preventible class of diseases, whether by the Zymotic diseases in early life, or the tubercular forms of disease a few years later, or the feeble constitution of many of the survivors growing up to early maturity, entails intolerable burdens upon the rate-paying community. The absolute unfitness for toil and honest labour which arises from vicious habits of domestic culture in large masses of the town populations, are circumstances that indicate the necessity of a future reform in municipal policy, having for its primary object the improvement of public health. Medical Officers of Health have hitherto had but a limited range of powers over certain causes of disease and death; but it is their duty to study all causes of premature and excessive deaths; and I may be excused in drawing attention to matters not generally discussed, but which I believe Local Authorities must sooner or later begin to deal with, rather than leave them to imperial or central administrative action. Road Scavenging. The general Scavenging of the Parish has much improved, but the streets are far from that state of cleanliness that ought to be. All main thoroughfares should be kept daily and hourly cleansed of horse droppings in summer. Some of the mews, and the roadway leading from the Great Western Goods Station, generally, are in a very unsatisfactory state. Constant removal of horse dung is rendered absolutely necessary 15 to avoid that pasty mass of foul animal matter from forming where roads are watered, or receive the moisture of rain. Evaporation of the mass in the sun is offensive to the senses, and a positive contamination of the atmosphere. Such air, if breathed while charged with animal exhalation, has been found favorable to the production of disease. The Ventilation and Flushing of Sewers. It has been the custom during several summer seasons for the drains in certain parts of the parish to be flushed by order of the Sanitary and Public Health Committee. I am satisfied that some of the intercepting drains are in a foul state, judging from the very numerous complaints of smell from sewage gas arising from gullies and open ventilators in the streets. During the summer weather, surface and storm water after a shower, acts beneficially in trapping the gulleys, and in diluting and carrying off foul deposits, but in the absence of this artificial flushing the gulley emits smell, and there are elements of danger ; therefore flushing ought periodical to be regularly provided. Some of the worst instances, best known to the Surveyor and the staff, demand, in in my opinion, his special attention, and the removal may become a question for the Highway Committee to discuss. Common Lodging-Houses. There are not a large number in this Parish, and they are all well kept and clean. The Police do their duty well. Special instructions were issued to them at the beginning of the Small Pox epidemic. 16 The Inspectors of Nuisances discovered several instances where nightly lodgers have been taken in, and these have been registered as common lodginghouses. There are coffee-houses in this Parish known to the Police as brothels, and as nightly lodgers are taken, they ought to be brought under the surveillance of Police Authority as common lodging-houses. Poultry kept in London. Poultry keeping increases to a great extent in London, and frequent complaints are made to me that fowls should be done away with as a nuisance. It ought to be more generally known that I cannot proceed against the owners of domestic animals for the noises they may make. It exceeds my province to interfere with fowls, pigeons, and dogs if kept in a cleanly state. Cock-crowing at 1 a.m , the barking of dogs, the cooing of pigeons near your chamber window, or any other nuisance arising from noise, by which the sleep of nervous people is disturbed, is a serious annoyance, and probably ought, as in the manner of the street music, to be under control, or to be put down by law ; but I cannot treat them as Sanitary nuisances. Urinals and Urinal Nuisances. This subject was under the consideration of a Subcommittee, who made a tour of inspection on three different occasions, with a view of reporting to the Sanitary and Public Health Committee. Their Report has not yet been completed ; meanwhile I have waited 17 upon the Magistrates on the day of the renewal of licences to Public Houses, to request that it should be obligatory upon the publican whose licences were renewed that an efficient urinal should be provided, and in particular those already found defective should be rectified forthwith. A list of defective urinals was prepared, and some of them are still under consideration, awaiting the decision of the Highway Committee, as to establishing, in convenient positions, additional public urinals. In the event of this being done, several private ones in bad situations might be altogether abolished. There are now only five public urinals in this large Parish—at least ten more are required—five more ought to be erected in main thoroughfares; one in Maida Hill, near the Cab Stand; another one at Kilburn, near the Queen's Arms ; another in Praed Street, at the junction of several streets, opposite the Junction Arms ; one in the Harrow Road, near or attached to the Ben Jonson. Here, on Saturdays, is a large market attendance of costermongers, with a greatly deficient accommodation. There are also in nooks and corners some very convenient localities for private urinals. The question of providing all the public urinals with a water supply and flushing apparatus, and in insisting upon publicans also providing the same, is a matter of serious inquiry. Its economical aspect is one suggestive of great difficulty. A man or a lad of shoe-black type to be in constant attendance for the purpose of cleansing and flushing, is a plan well worth B 18 consideration. I recommend this latter plan, more particularly as I am satisfied that w.c. accommodation ought also to be a feature of any latter system ; and further, that w.c. accommodation for females as well as males—only a slight modification in the manner of constructing a separate entrance to the latrine— ought and could be easily provided. A single urinal, with a constant stream of water, will vary from £10 to £25 per annum, even if supplied by metre at the fair cost; the waste is very great: 118,000 gallons per month has been known to be used in some instances. I prefer a daily attendant, whose remuneration indirectly from the public, without cost to the rate-payers, would be satisfactory. A Public Disinfecting Establishment. It is much to be regretted that all efforts to obtain a Disinfecting Establishment for the use of the Parish have been unsuccessful, on account of the difficulty in getting a site for it. The question has for a long time occupied the most anxious attention of the Sanitary Committee. Various places have been visited, and other places suggested ; all of which have presented insuperable obstacles. The stone yard, the closed burial ground of St. Mary's, the spare ground of the workhouse, the open fields on the Paddington estate, a corner of the cemetery at Willesden, the wharves on the canal basin, and other situations have all had to be abandoned. My own belief is, that the Vestry ought to avail themselves of the powers of the Sanitary Act, 1866, 19 sec. 37, to provide a small Cottage Hospital for the temporary reception of those non-pauper cases, that require isolation or removal when attacked with a contagious disease, where they can remain until convalescent and safe to return to their families. In consequence of a letter from the Secretary of the London Fever Hospital in July last year and again in January this year, soliciting an Annual Subscription for one more bed to be kept in readiness, the Sanitary Committee had under consideration the question of providing for the removal and reception of persons suffering from a dangerous infectious disease. Recent regulations of the Metropolitan Asylum Board render it impossible for Guardians legally to take charge of a certain class of non-pauper cases as they were formerly accustomed to do. Our present system would break down in the event of any severe epidemic. At present we are dependent upon two sources : First, Guardians taking cases simply as Paupers ; Secondly, the Vestry send them to the Fever Hospital at Islington, or to the Small Pox Hospital at Highgate, on payment of a fee. At some future time one or more Authorities (as suggested in the Act), might possibly agree to have a Hospital, or part of an existing Hospital, and in connexion with it a place for disinfection of clothing and articles of bedding would be provided for. There is ample proof that such an Institution would be nearly self-supporting. Everybody is under the delusion that it would be a dangerous nuisance in their neighbourhood, in spite of the opinions expressed by some of the most eminent 20 authorities that the disinfection and cleansing of bedding and clothes may be effected without the least annoyance to anyone. Plans and details of an apparatus have been carefully prepared, and it might be ready for action as soon as a site could be selected. The principle of heat, without using any of the smelling or disinfectant chemicals can be relied upon ; but where sulphur, chlorine, or other gases are used, the vapours are to be carried off, after passing through the heating flues. There need not be the least exposure of infected things passing through the streets. A covered iron vehicle being so used, that by Frazer's method, the things are conveyed from the house and returned to the owners in a securely closed carriage. It is however most essential, in my opinion, that a washing room, drying closet, and an ironing room adjoining, should also be provided, so that no laundress need be compelled to receive infected articles with her other washing, and so risk the dissemination of the poison of an infectious disease. The Workshops Regulation Act. During the latter part of last year the Inspector of Factories expressed a desire to have a return of the probable number of establishments under inspection in the Metropolitan Districts under the Workshops Regulation Act of 1867, with a view of presenting to Parliament in connexion with a similar return of the Factories. 21 Statistics of Workshop Inspections. There are in this Parish about 652 workshops in which various kinds of handicraft are carried on, of which the following are the chief:- Manufactures connected with Clothing:— Boot and Shoe Making 91 Mantle, Millinery, Corset, and Dress Making. 135 Tailors and Clothiers 46 Manufactures connected with Metal:— Cutlers, Locksmiths, Blacksmiths, Zinc Workers, Articles or Machines of Metal, Engineers, Clocks, Watch Making &c 88 Leather Manufacture:—Sadlery, Harness & Whips 18 Manufactures connected with Food:— Bakers, Biscuits, Confectionery, Brewing (1), Chocolate (1) 84 Manufacture connected with Building Trade:— Builders, Carpenters, Plumbers, Painters, Paper Hanging, Decorators, &c. 61 Miscellaneous Manufactures:— Cabinet, and Furniture Makers and Turners, Coach Builders, Wheelwrights, French Polishers, Blinds and Umbrella Makers, Undertakers and Coffin Makers, and Laundresses 1 '29 Total Workshops 652 Sewing and other Machines employed 123 Steam Engines (not locomotives) 5 Number of Children under 13, employed 7 Males between 13 and 18 100 Females above 13 629 Males above 18 914 Total Workers 1650 22 My notes of workshop inspection led me to believe that there are about 700 females engaged at needlework in dressmaking establishments, besides a large number of private houses unknown. As the carrying out of the provisions of this Act by the local Authority was entrusted to me, and as from the first I always considered it an important part of the functions of a health officer, I felt prepared to make the return asked for, although it involved considerable labour and extra assistance to collect the details on forms provided for the purpose by H.M.'s Inspector of Factories. I had previously inspected and obtained records of about fifty of the establishments in which large numbers of females were employed in dressmaking, millinery, &c., but had not attempted a more general inspection (which sooner or later I deemed to be a desirable object) of all the workshops where labour and handicraft of various kinds were carried on. To accomplish this task, and to keep proper records of the state of things discoverable, and to make suggestions for Sanitary improvement, would be sufficient work to occupy the time of a special officer, while the experience gained in obtaining the return, is so exceedingly instructive with regard to the social condition of large numbers of the work people carrying on their trade in private houses or small shops, that it fully warrants me in saying great benefit would accrue from a regular periodical inspection. It is not so much for the protection of females and children, for whom the Workshops Regulation Act was at first designed ; but regular inspection is desirable to secure a better state of cleanliness and 23 ventilation, more cubic space, and proper w.c. accommodation than is at present found to exist. Many cases have come under my notice where workpeople, male and female, have become fatally attacked with consumption through no other cause but from working days in succession in close under-ground rooms, with deficiency of light and fresh air, having scarcely any change, either night or day. It was not very uncommon to find dress makers, tailors, or shoe makers, with their family, occupying but a single room, and that containing the bedding and other furniture, with cooking utensils and food; perhaps also a sewingmachine, a shop-board, or a shoemaker's bench. Worse than this, is the washing, drying and ironing in a single living room, or in a front or small back kitchen. It is only right to say that families so situated have been frequently driven to this state of misfortune, by improvident, or drinking habits. The deterioration of health from living in this " hugger mugger" way in a kitchen, or in a crowded house, shows itself upon some of those whose constitutions were originally the most robust, while the rate of mortality in childhood often ranges up to 60 per cent. of all that are born, before they reach the fifth year. The tubercular or wasting forms of disease, and the poisons of the contagious spreading diseases, make shocking havoc in these insalubrious abodes; so thoroughly vicious is this form of overcrowding in solitary work-rooms of private houses, that in the interest of humanity, and those who ultimately bear the burden of sickness and pauperism, some method of checking the dangers by sanitary supervision ought 24 to be adopted. Where Public Baths and Washhouses exist, it should no longer be permitted to carry on family washing either in a single room, or in a house, where more than one family resides. I have long since been convinced that nothing is more prejudicial to health and comfort than the living room converted into, or closely contiguous to a washing place; the exhalations of dirty water and moist dirty clothing, of water spilled on floor boards, matting or carpet, evaporation of moisture, or fermentation going on day or night, is a repulsive nuisance. Public Work Rooms. As a remedy for many of the evils here alluded to, Public Workshops should be provided by the municipal authority ; where a number of small compartments or rooms, well lighted and ventilated, could be profitably let out at small weekly rentals ; this would at once obviate the necessity for pursuing daily labour under conditions unsafe to health. Such conveniences, with recreation grounds in the shape of public gardens, walks and ornamental open spaces, with seats under shady trees, accessible to the lowest class, are now becoming absolutely essential to preserve healthy vitality, and save the risk which threatens large numbers of persons from a gradual degeneration. Abundant proof of this can be found in the more thickly populated parts of this wealthy Parish. A few hundred pounds would be amply repaid in health and in having the satisfaction of some benefit for rates, while the diminution of pauperism would soon be manifest. 25 Female Labour. Female labour is on a very unsatisfactory footing— young women living at home with their parents, certainly earn wages which contribute partly to their maintenance ; some married women work far below the fair value of labour to supplement the wages of a husband whose work is casual and uncertain, often from drunkenness ; female labour even attempts to compete with manufacturing establishments ; some married women again, who erroneously desire to utilize their spare time in working for shops, neglect domestic duties, and thus lower the price of female labour of single women. The worst cases, however, are those of the solitary sempstress, prolonging her hours of work in a small close room, or working by candle light, far into the night, bringing about some debilitating illness, chest disease, failing sight, and premature death. " It is sad to think," says Jules Simon, " That all this elegance of female attire, gloves, lace, embroidery, jewels, objects of the toilet, so necessary for our luxury and pleasure, should represent such painful thoughts. There is scarcely one of the fashionable and fancy ornaments which have not a sad history. The wages are not enough to clothe and nourish the body, they do not even find bread." The vicious state of female labour is, in fact, the root of half our prostitution. The Workshop Regulation Act has already done great service, it is, we believe, in future to be worked as a part of the Factory Act, and no longer to be permissive in its operation. 26 Sanitary Legislation. During the last Session many Bills were brought before the Legislature which had more or less important bearings in relation to the public health, and to powers exercised by local authorities. I may remark that some of them have yet to be discussed, and are worthy of mature consideration. The Metropolis Water Bill after much alteration, passed both Houses, and has become law; so also has the Vaccination Amendment Act ; the Factory and Workshops Regulation Amendment Act, and an Act which transfers to the Local Government Office, the functions of the Poor Law and Medical Department of the Privy Council. But there will be others of greater importance again brought forward next Session affecting the Metropolis and the Country at large. The Metropolis Buildings Management Act, is one intended to amend the Building Acts, and for regulating the for- mation of streets, sewers, and drains in the Metropolis, it has already been before the Parliamentary Committee. A group of Bills, such as the prevention of Railway Accidents ; the Regulation of Mines Bill; the Storage of Petroleum ; the Fires Bill, to make provision for inquiry into the origin and circumstances of Fires ; the Coroners Bill ; Contagious Diseases Prevention Bill; the Bill to amend the Act for the Adulteration of Food and Drink, and extend its provisions to Drugs—all these stand over for reconsideration. The public health and safety are much endangered from want of a competent authority and local inspection over the storing and removal of explosive substances, 27 naptha, fireworks, gunpowder — fires in houses and buildings, street traffic, steam boilers, fixed or locomotive engines; all these matters ought to be under a thorough and periodical inspection by a local officer. One of the above-mentioned, " Metropolis Buildings Management Bill," appears to have the gravest defects in its sanitary aspect. Under its present shape it does not seem calculated to prevent the various evils that have escaped the Act now in operation. A Building Act ought at least to guarantee that houses should be erected with due regard to all the essential conditions for securing health, both in the structure itself, its foundations and surroundings, also for ventilation, drainage, and w.c. accommodation. The new buildings of this Parish are not so flimsy as many that I could name ; but few of the new houses are massive and firm, some are even built upon garden mould, or old " slop shoots." These thin and flimsy shells of lath and plaster, truly merit the term, " slop buildings." A dangerous moisture and miasma arises from houses built upon such an unhealthy foundation. Many instances of point have come before my notice. There ought to be clauses sufficiently stringent to prevent the mortar used both for building and for the plaster of walls, from being made of slop refuse or road scrapings, which contain nearly 20 per cent. of animal excrement. To keep badly built houses in good sanitary condition, landlords are necessitated in making a constant and vexatious outlay, which so in proportion increases the rental. A remedy too ought to be provided for the formation of proper roadways 28 before houses are tenanted. There are in this Parish roadways in a dangerous state to health from the foetid exhalations arising from the " hard core" used as a foundation, containing a large amount of organic matter, fish shells and vegetable refuse. This ought to be covered over at once, and the road finished before the houses are occupied. Numerous have been this class of Complaints lately. Then there are three Bills which propose to attack the increasing evils of intemperance:—1. The Intoxicating Liquors (Licensing) Bill. 2. The Permissive prohibiting Liquor Traffic, to enable the owners and occupiers of property in certain districts to prevent the common sale of intoxicating liquor within their district. 3. Habitual Drunkards—a Bill to amend the law of lunacy, and to provide for the management of Habitual Drunkards. This most useful measure of Dr. Dalrymple, will, if passed into law, effect immense benefit for the large class of inebriates, who ought long ago to have been treated as lunatics. The Local Government Bill, although exempting the Metropolis from its sphere of action, embodies the recommendations of the Report of the Royal Sanitary Commission, will be a codification of nearly all the Sanitary Acts, and is intended to have very great influence upon Sanitary Authorities throughout the whole country. It promises to be the great work of legislation for next Session of Parliament. 29 Sanitary Work of the Year. During the last year a larger amount of work than usual has been done ; this is partly owing to greater facility in the mode of procedure with regard to the issue of preliminary notices. Formerly, notices for works were delayed until the fortnightly meeting of the Sanitary Committee, now they are issued at once, or the objector shows cause why he refuses to execute the order. Cases of persons so neglecting or refusing are now submitted to the Vestry by formal or Vestry order, but a small per cent. only of all orders are objected to. The following is a summary of work done:— Cleansing and Lime-washing of Areas, Yards, Basement, Rooms, Stairs, Passages 477 Provide or Repair Dust Bins, or Remove Dust, Refuse, &c 102 Pave, or amend Paving on Yards, Cellars, Open Spaces, &c. 88 Provide or reinstate Water Supply, or Cleanse the Receptacle, &c 45 Provide or reinstate the W. C. Apparatus, &c. 446 Repair, Open, Construct, or Trap Drain, or Open Ground, &c. 61 Ventilate Rooms, Stairs, Workshops, &c. 45 Discontinue Underground Dwellings, and Abate Over-crowding in Rooms 6 Disinfect Rooms, Articles of Clothing, Bedding, close Infected Rooms 70 Repair Dilapidation of Premises, Ceilings, Stairs, and Roof 104 Remove Manure, Animals and Offensive Accumulations 44 The slaughter-houses, cow-sheds, marine stores and offensive trades, are under constant inspection. 30 Report on the Duties of the Sanitary Inspectors. During the latter part of last year the Sanitary and Public Health Committee made a Report upon the duties of the Sanitary Inspectors; the general result of which was that this large and increasing Parish required the full services of two Inspectors, each responsible for his own work; that the labours devolving upon them were equally important, but that certain class of duties should be assigned to one Inspector, and certain other class to the other. It was obvious, remarked the Committee, that the distribution might have been effected in another manner, viz., by assigning a territorial division of the Parish to each Officer and permitting them to perform all the duties of them. The Committee allowed my recommendation to prevail of assigning to each Inspector special duties, except in particular cases and special emergencies, and I have additional proof that this arrangement of work was a judicious one, and without which the same amount of efficiency could not have been accomplished. Inspector Clifford has had under his attention upwards of 400 cases of epidemic disease, principally of small pox and scarlet fever, since January 3rd : the removal of cases, and frequent visits for carrying out disinfecting arrangements, and for adopting precautions necessary to prevent the spread of these diseases occupied for some weeks during the small pox epidemic, his whole time, and of course his duties were arduous, and suspended the systematic inspection of streets and 31 houses, which was his proper work, and which he has since resumed. Inspector Parsons has uninterruptedly attended to complaints of nuisances, the inspection of all mewses and stables, wharves on the canal, offensive trades, marine stores, cow-sheds and slaughter houses. This division of labor has worked well. A Sanitary Report of the work of the past year would not be complete without mentioning that a Report was made on houses of Courts on the North side of Harrow Road, in which it was stated that these tenements were most of them unfit for human habitation, and ought to be demolished under the clauses of the Artizans' Dwelling Act; nor ought it to be forgotten that the Vestry have appointed Commissioners to carry out the Provisions of the Acts to establish Public Baths and Wash-houses in this Parish. This is the true foundation of Public hygiene, and without which all other sanitary agencies are comparatively insignificant. No. 11.

The births were 718. The deaths are more than 100 in excess of the usual amount. The deaths from epidemic diseases were 92, or 16.0 per cent. of the whole deaths, being an average of the three last quarters and not in excess of former ones. Ten deaths were from measles, 31 from scarlet fever, 22 from whooping cough, 11 from diarrhoea, 16 from fever. This last item requires explanation : it includes deaths returned as: gastric fever 3 ; brain fever 2 ; nervous fever 1 ; typhoid fever 8. I believe there are no true cases of typhus. The typhoid are doubtful and complicated with other diseases. 2 Deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs this quarter are high; inflammatory diseases of the chest, bronchitis 95, and pneumonia 44, =139, are exclusive of consumption 44. The tubercular diseases, scrofula, marasmus, messenteric disease, tubercular disease of the brain, and water on the brain, account for 28 deaths— all in very young children. The infant mortality (deaths under 5 years of age being 206) is very high in the Parish ; but as a contrast more satisfactory to reflect upon, a very large proportion of deaths are from extreme old age ; in 15 deaths recorded from old age—natural decay, 11 of these were upwards of eighty; 20 deaths were from mechanical violence and falls 7, drowning 1, burns and scalds 8, suffocation 1, suicide and infanticide 3. The Scarlet Fever Epidemic. Scarlet fever has been severely fatal in the Parish : its presence still lingers. It is to be regretted that we have rarely any official means of knowing were the cases occur until the return of deaths gives information, when it is too late to suggest means for arresting the progress of contagion. Let it not be thought that families of the lower class most suffer by this epidemic of scarlatina. Lancaster Gate, Westbourne Terrace, Craven Road, Cleveland Square, Gloucester Place, Southwick Crescent, Sussex Square, in the rich district of St. Johns, have had their victims as well as the overcrowded houses in Woodchester Street, Clarendon Street, Cirencester Street, Dartington Terrace, Carlton and other Mews, in some of which, two or even three children from one house have been taken off.

There are some small tradesmen, the necessary provision shops, and one public house in the middle of the estate. Epidemic maladies have from time to time been recorded, inspection has been made forthwith, and orders given for disinfection, and occasionally for removal to hospital. These houses have been built within 15 years, and are of nearly uniform size and construction ; most are let out to weekly lodgers; some are overcrowded slightly ; but the sanitary effects are not numerous. The drainage is tolerably good. The opening of St. Mary's Church-yard will be a great advantage to more than 3000 persons living in this crowded locality, which indeed has only outlets on the East side, being enclosed on three sides. The thoroughfare into the Church-yard from the comer of Cuthbert Street ought to be opened at once. 7 How Scarlet Fever is propagated. Family washing is often sent to poor women whose circumstances are not such as to enable them to do it with safety. Some of the members of a family of this description are "down with the fever the infection is by this means introduced into a healthy household with the clean linen. It should always be ascertained what conveniences exist for washing and drying. If the family linen has to be washed, dried and ironed, as it frequently must be, in the close atmosphere of a room, in a crowded dwelling, it may catch and retain the organic particles which are capable of carrying disease into the mansions of the rich. Tailor's work is often done at home when scarlet fever and measles are present, and nothing more readily absorbs and carries the contagious matter than woollen articles. Another example recently came under my notice. A lad went out on trial as an apprentice, and was put into the same bed, which had latterly been slept in by another lad who had just gone away with scarlet fever. He caught the disease, and was sent home to his friends. These and other unsuspected ways in which infectious diseases are conveyed, are cogent arguments of themselves, to show the necessity of an establishment where personal ablution, washing and cleansing of linen, and the disinfecting operations can be safely and efficiently carried on. My recommendation is that Public Baths and a Laundry will in every way meet the public requirements. Such an establishment has long been wanting in this Parish. See further remarks in my Annual Report for 1869-70. A Public Disinfecting Establishment.. The want of a proper place, where infected clothes, bedding, linen and woollen things could be removed to be purified and disinfected, has been very seriously felt, and expressions of surprise are not unfrequently made to me that no provision has yet been made to meet this want. On the 20th of January, the Committee, to whom the question of providing a Disinfecting Establishment was referred, reported to the Vestry that the most fit and proper place for such an establishment was the North End of the Burial Ground contiguous to Manor Place. As a Public Mortuary and Deadhouse had been previously recommended, and the closed Burying Ground was to be improved and opened, it was suggested that all objects might be combined at an additional expense of about £300 for fittings and appliances. This recommendation has not meet with an approval by the Vestry, therefore the matter stands over for future consideration, both with respect to the Public Mortuary and a Public Disinfecting Establishment. The improvements of the old closed Burying Ground are now nearly completed and it is ready for opening to the Public. 8 The Workshop Regulation Act. Upwards of fifty shops and work-rooms of dress makers and milliners are under occasional inspection, in which above four hundred young women are employed—none, of the provisions of the Act. are known to be infringed, although anonymous communications and letters from a Mr. Haines, have hinted at persons who evaded the law, and that night work has been suspected in one or two cases. I have always investigated these complaints, and have the authority of the Sanitary Committee, as well as instructions from the Inspector of Factories, to attend to any violation of the provisions of this Act. The Ragged School in Church Place. A Report on the state of this School and premises was made in March. The rooms were found to be defective, both in regard to construction and cubic space. Great improvements are now being carried out under the advice and direction of the District Surveyor. This School has been in an overcrowded state for some time, and many complaints of children taking from, or carrying to this School spreading diseases, have come to my knowledge. The most perfect ventilation and personal cleanliness ought to be insisted upon by the Committee of the School to prevent contagious diseases spreading to the houses of a class of parents who, as a rule, occupy only one room.

The births, 100 less than usual—618, are at the rate of 24.5 per 1000. The deaths from Zymotic diseases, 62, are very low; half of these are from Scarlet Fever, which is still epidemic in this District. The deaths of children under 5 years of age are also less than the average, probably owing to the mild weather. 39 deaths were in St. Mary's Hospital, and 31 were in the Workhouse, and 2 in the Lock Hospital. Inquests were held on 28 deaths — more than half being after accidents sent into St. Mary's Hospital. In Waverley Road two children in one family died from Whooping Cough ; also in Alfred Road, in Charles Mews, and in Burlington Mews from Scarlatina. One death and a serious accident occured from falling from flats behind houses that are not properly protected by fence or 2 parapet. This kind of accident has frequently happened from the same negligence—the houses in Woodchester Street, Clarendon Street, Cirencester Street, Hethpool Street, and perhaps a few others, have a room thrown out behind, with a flat roof, sometimes without any protection by rail or parapet. Inquests have been held upon these accidents, and a Memorial drawing attention to them was lately presented. Mr. Greatorex brought the subject before the Vestry, and it has been suggested that a clause be inserted in the proposed new building Management Act, to insist that owners of houses should protect this kind of roof, as it is generally used for the drying of linen hung out on lines—and children having access to them, meet with grave accidents by falling over in the area below. The following is a short Summary of proceedings during the last Quarter:— The combined Drainage of St. Mary's Terrace. The owners of Nos. 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 54, 56, 58, 60 and 66 have orders to drain into the Sewers fronting their respective premises, and to contribute towards the cost of the construction of the Sewer. The Manure Loading Nuisances. Complaints before a Magistrate for undue retention of manure were recommended against Bunce, Juson, and Franklin, but were not carried out in consequence of the complete abatement of the nuisances in question, and promises to keep their wharves in better condition for the future.

I hese Streets are highly populated, almost every house is let out in holdings ; some houses and rooms are occasionally found to be overcrowded, especially where the family can only afford a single room. 1 know of no means to abate this form of overcrowding—we cannot turn them out. 7 Improvement of Harrow Road and demolition of Houses in Courts on the North side. I was requested to furnish a Report on the condition of small tenements proposed to be taken down for the purpose of widening Harrow Road. A summary of this Report will be found in my Annual Report. The Committee have also under consideration in connexion with the Bill to be introduced into Parliament for the improvement of Harrow Road, and Edgware Roads, whether any provision should be made, such as is contemplated in 191st standing order of the House of Lords, for remedying the inconvenience likely to arise from the displacement of the tenants of the houses proposed to be demolished. In pursuance therewith, a Sub-Committee was appointed to enquire and report as to any site that may exist in the Parish for the erection of model dwelling houses for such persons as may be displaced in the event of the proposed improvements being carried out. Refuse from Gullies. In conjunction with the Surveyor, I reported upon the best method to be adopted for disinfecting gully refuse after it was taken out, and it was resolved that all gully refuse should be removed as speedily as possible, but meanwhile to be disinfected at a cost not exceeding 1s. 6d. a day for materials. The Ventilation of Sewers. Dangerous nuisances are frequently caused from the Sewer Ventilators in the Street. One in St. Stephen's Crescent was so bad that persons could not sit out on the balcony opposite. It was referred to the Highway Committee, who ordered its removal. The thanks of the inhabitauts were tendered for the relief afforded by the removal of what they termed a "virulent nuisance." Utilization of Urine. A request of Mr. J. Banheur, to be informed on what terms the Vestry will grant a concession of the Urine obtained from the Public Urinals for a term of three years, has been referred to me for consideration and report. The Canal Basin. On the 4th of June the water was let off from the Canal Basin, with the prospect of cleansing it. I waited upon the Directors of the Canal Company representing the precautions which the Committee deemed expedient for making such cleansing effectual, and to point out the insufficient compliance therewith on the last occasion of cleansing, and to urge the Company the necessity of exercising their authority to secure 8 satisfactory operations. J further called the attention of the Directors to the practice of discharging water saturated with manure into the Canal, after the barges have passed the weigh bridge. In conjunction with the Engineer of the Canal Company, I waited upon all the Wharfingers on the Basin, and received the assurance from them that they would do their utmost in meeting the wishes of the Committee, by aiding in the efficient cleansing of the Basin, in those portions of frontage opposite their respective holdings. The Report of the Inspector of Nuisance on the manner in which the work was accomplished, shows that 43 boats were employed, and about 100 men for two or nearly three days; but that the middle portions of the Basin were not thoroughly cleansed of mud—in some places— and that a large quantity of soft mud was still remaining when the water was admitted into the Basin. Resignation of the Assistant Inspector. On May 6th, Inspector Davenport was reported to have been absent from duty for a fortnight, and was requested to attend the next Committee; his explanation not being sufficiently satisfactory, he was requested to resign his situation. On the 16th of June, a letter was received tendering his resignation. He had been an excellent Officer, and did much useful Sanitary work.

Of these, 42 deaths occurred in St. Mary's Hospital, and 31 in the Workhouse. The birth-rate is 27.2 per 1000. The mortality in children under 5 years is 44.7 per cent. of the total deaths from all causes. The zymotic diseases are 28.4 per cent, of deaths—and the tubercular class, including consumption, 18 per cent. No death from small-pox has happened for some time; only 4 deaths from measles. This presents a favourable aspect. But 43 deaths from scarlet fever is the highest ever known in the Parish, and indicates no abatement of its epidemic character. Measles were epidemic during the winter of 1867-68. Until July 1869, measels and scarlet lever were very slightly fatal—the latter was however epidemic in all parts of London, and soon began to show itself here, where it 2 has since prevailed very generally. The quarterly deaths from scarlet fever have been 26, 34, 44, 31, 30, 43, for the last 18 months, or double the normal average. The diarrhoea cases are always high during the second summer quarter—the large proportion being in children under one year old. Mid-nutrition, ignorance of child-feeding, depraved breast milk, or want of it, are the most prominent causes of this form of' death, favoured as they are by the hot weather. In looking over Table V. it will be seen that 9 deaths from scarlet fever occur in one street—this indicates at least 100 cases of sickness, or centres of contagion in this one street—it is certainly thickly populated—134 houses, with an average population of not less than 15 inhabitants in each. Of which 700 or 800 are children going daily to and from schools, thus likely to communicate and spread the disease. In this street and in Amberly Road, a street of much the same character, 10 or 12 children may be found living in a house. The cubic space or conditions of over-crowding are not such as either landlord or Sanitary officers can judiciously meddle with; nor are there any Sanitary defects demanding orders from the authorities. It is purely a spread of contagion. The poor who live in houses and streets less decent, and orderly, but where the doors are always open, and the children are always in the street, suffer less than those who are kept clean and orderly, and go regularly to school.

Douglas Place is closely populated, the houses have very small back yards. Edgware Place is a square Court, with only one small outlet; it will be seen that here are nearly 100 children. Modena Street and Elcom Street are new Streets in Kensal New Town on the banks of the Canal. 7 The Appointment of a Second Inspector. As the Report relating to the duties of Inspectors has been printed and circulated amongst the Members of the Vestry, it will be simply necessary for me to make a few brief remarks. It is estimated that 2200 houses are let out in separate tenements, that house and rooms require regular systematic inspection, in order that the Vestry and Medical Officer of Health may be made acquainted with the actual state of the worst localities; the records of the visits must also be made upon the sheets prepared for the purpose ; indeed, books must be so kept that any Member of the Board may without trouble, see what Sanitary defects have been discovered, what works have been done at any period, and in any particular locality. The work already done during the last few years, has had a most wholesome influence upon landlord and tenant—thousands of small jobs and constructive works have been ordered for the comfort of the latter, and the former has found his lower class of tenants vastly improved by supervision. If the Vestry agree that this work is to continue on the system I have endeavoured to carry out for three years, an intelligent man of good character must be employed. The Sanitary and Public Health Committee therefore are unanimously of opinion that such a man can only be obtained from a class of candidates who are offered a salary of not less than £100 per annum. The present Inspector is always fully occupied in attending to complaints, superintending works, manure wharves, offensive trades, cow and slaughter houses, and the systematic inspection of houses in stables and mews. He has never been able to make any progress in systematic inspections of streets of the tenant and house population without neo-lectins his other work. TABLE VII.

Mr. Franklin was fined in September for non-removal of deposit at No. 1 Amberley Wharf. The strictest supervision over the manure wharves is necessary to prevent deposits. In summer time the smell from mews and stables penetrating drawing-rooms by the back of houses in squares is much complained of. The loading and removal ought to take place at early morning hours. Slaughtering Cattle without a License. Mr. Grenfield was fined 20s. and costs in August last for slaughtering in a place not licensed, in accordance with the Metropolis Local Management Act. Workshop Regulation Act. Under the penal clauses of this Act I obtained a conviction against Mrs. Marian Pridham, of Queen's Road, Bayswater, in July last. The case was heard before Mr. Mansfield, who gave judgment—fined the defendant 40s. in two instances, with costs. Other establishments under inspection readily complied with my request to remove the hands employed in the kitchens under-ground, and from a small room to a more airy and well ventilated apartment. Rag, Bone, and Marine Store Shops. During the Summer a regular course of inspection was made of these places — letters and complaints of nuisances have frequently been made. The removal, as well as storage of bones fat and grease is a most unmitigated nuisance in populated streets. I recommended the Inspector to give orders to the proprietors of these places to provide a covered bin for the reception of bones, and to keep the fat or grease in barrels or tubs, provided with a tight fitting cover. The premises ought to be washed and cleansed at least twice in the year ; in default of the execution of these orders, the Inspector of Nuisances has been instructed to report to the Sanitary Committee, who I trust will proceed for penalties under the Nuisance Removal Act.

There must therefore be a general improvement of public health; although the epidemic of Scarlet Fever still lingers. The Births are as usual in excess of Deaths. There are 82 deaths from the Zymotic or spreading forms of disease, half of which were from Scarlet Fever. This epidemic of Scarlet Fever has now been prevalent throughout London for more than 18 months. It has destroyed in this Parish the following number of lives, principally of young children, in each quarter—ending June 1869, 26; September, 1869, 34; December 1869, 44 ; March 1870, 31 ; June, 1870, 30; September 1870, 43 ; December 1870, 42 ; total 250. 2 While however this disease begins to show signs of decline, a worse scourge is threatening in the form of Small Pox. For some weeks Small Pox deaths have been gradually increasing in London, and the disease appears to be spreading from East to Western districts. I have watched with considerable anxiety its gradual approach ; four cases which came under my notice during the quarter were removed to the Small Pox Hospital, and steps taken to prevent the further spread of the infection. We cannot at this moment congratulate ourselves upon the immunity from this disease, which we have enjoyed for the last four years. The Small Pox Hospital is full ; the new Hospital for Fever at Hampstead is also full; so that with much regret the Guardians have been compelled to admit a few cases into the Workhouse during the last 10 days, taking every possible precaution to secure isolation and separate attention ; in fact, to prevent the further spread of the disease. The following number of cases were removed to the Fever and Small Pox Hospital by the Fever Carriage ; and two bodies of persons who died from a contagious disease were removed to the dead-house:—October; 2 Small Pox, 2 Scarlet Fever, 1 Typhus. November ; 2 Small Pox, 6 Scarlet Fever. December ; 3 Small Pox, 1 Scarlet Fever. The deaths of young children are lower than on some previous quarters as the following numbers will show—174 ; 209 ; 171 ; 206 ; 162 last quarter. TABLE II.

The Sanitary and Public Health Committee have always manifested a desire to deal with the question of means that ought to be taken for checking the spread of contagious diseases. A Public Mortuary has been recommended on more than one occasion; plans and details have been prepared; a disinfecting establishment has likewise been approved and recommended. During the last quarter almost every case of Scarlet Fever and the cases of Small Pox that came under my notice were visited personally, in order to ascertain whether proper measures had been taken to isolate the patients, and to cleanse, purify or disinfect rooms, clothing, bedding and things likely to retain infection. I generally found this had been effected under the direction of the medical practitioner in attendance. In the absence of a disinfecting establishment, a contract has been entered into with Messrs. Armfield and Son, of Pimlico, who undertake to remove, cleanse and disinfect articles at a fixed price per cwt. The suggestions made in my Report presented to the Vestry in November 1869, on means for carrying out disinfection in the most effectual manner in this Parish, have already been carried out in some other Parishes of the Metropolis, and subsequent experience has shown that the numbers of persons who have paid for things being purified, would have willingly sent to such an establishment, and have made it partially, if not wholly, self-supporting. Besides a public disinfecting chamber and a washing room adjoining, the Parish ought to be provided with a hand carriage for the conveyance of contaminated things requiring to be disinfected, washed, or purified, away from the houses where Fever cases have occurred. Public Baths and Wash-houses have long been wanted in this Parish. My Report upon certain improvements in the equipment of the Fever Carriage is now ready for approval and adoption. While this Report is going through the printer's hands (January 20), the Sanitary Inspectors are engaged daily in vigilantly watching, and attending to the isolation and removal of Small Pox cases that have recently shown themselves in this Parish. The full details of these will be given in my fortnightly Reports to the Sanitary and Public Health Committee, and will be found also in my next quarterly Report. Some examples of these cases are very instructive, and demonstrate the urgent necessity of practical enforcement of Sanitary laws on the part of local authority; indeed, it is only until some danger threatens the higher classes that the consequences of the culpable and neglected municipal laws appear in their true significance. While, however, much may be done by local authorities to 7 repress contagious diseases, or even to "stamp out" altogether epidemic disease,—an attainable object—many circumstances baffle their most willing efforts; indeed, no hope of success can be entertained until fresh attempts at Sanitary legislation bring about a better Sanitary organization. One great obstacle to contend with, is the want of a general registration of disease ; Zymotic forms of disease ought at any rate to be made compulsory. For, although contagious maladies comprise more than one-fourth of all the deaths, it is a mere fraction of these cases known to the Public and Sanitary Authorities of a District; private medical practitioners do not report them, nor are parents or guardians, school teachers, relieving officers under the poorlaw compelled to give notice of cases that occur in schools or private houses. Medical Officers of Health, it is true, get the weekly returns from the Registrar General of Deaths. Even this, I am told, is a complimentary rather than an official document, and for every single death therein recorded there must be at least eight or nine other (non-fatal) causes. The returns of the Poor-Law Medical Officers are but a faint indication of the seat and extent of epidemic maladies It has been shown in a paper which I wrote on the subject, entitled " How the Government may beneficially interfere to limit the spread of infectious diseases''— Transactions of the Social Science Association at Belfast 1869 — that until a registration of Zymotic diseases is called for by the legislature, no practical methods can be adopted for "stamping out" contagious disease, or such as will be worthy of being ranked as an efficient system of Sanitation. The Royal Sanitary Commission have just issued a report, in which certain principles have been laid down as a guide for future legislation, and to assist in a consolidation of the laws relating to public health. The Chairman of our Sanitary and Public Health Committee has been one of the most indefatigable workers on this Commission. Some persons, even in the present day, deny the possibilities of "stamping out" Small Pox, Typhus, Typhoid, Scarlet Fever, Cholera, &c. The idea is thought to be Utopian. It is just as unreasonable to believe that we must be infested with vermin, bugs, fleas, lice, and itch, which, like the spreading diseases, are the invariable concomitants of neglected domestic sanitary regulations; and their eradition is as perfectly within the sphere of either public or private hygiene. The danger of harbouring a contagious disease, it must also be remembered, is not confined to the individual suffering; it is a matter that concerns the community; so far therefore has the State a right of interference with "the liberty of the subject," and especially ought this power to be exercised over personal action where public health and life are endangered by any neglected private duty. 8 But it is in the dwellings of the poor, where from municipal neglect, the seeds of contagion are allowed to be nourished, and from whence they are scattered abroad in all directions; in the street, in cabs and omnibuses. They are brought into our houses with the washing and mangling, or the new woollen dress sent home by the tailor or dressmaker; they are introduced into the kitchen by outside communication with the servants, or from the mews at the back of the mansion. By all these methods I can cite numerous instances.* I have not here space to speak of remedial measures, further than observe that Ratepayers will find their most costly burdens are the various form of misery, pauperism and crime, brought about by licenced liquor traffic, and palliated rather than prevented by an erroneous Poor-Law policy. It ignores the causes of evils which it in vain seeks to remedy. The manifold forms of disease and depravity affecting both the body and mind are daily increasing the number of charitable institutions with their expensive staff of officials; but until preventive measures are wisely devised, and strictly enforced, no true economy will follow our efforts for the promotion of public health, which is the primary duty of every citizen. *It is but three generations ago, when the jail fever, like plague and smallpox the century before, was so contagious and infectious that it not only killed prisoners wholesale, but affected those in court, judges, counsel, attorneys, jury, and persons of all ranks who attended at the trials. Scurvy and fevers in ships were once so fatal, that Anson who went round the world with 1000 men in his ships returned with only 200 alive. Thirty years afterwards Captain Cook went round the world with 118 men, was absent three years and eighteen days exposed to all kinds of climate, but lost only three men from accident and one from disease. Cook, who was a real sanitary reformer, read a paper before the Royal Society, and showed what could be done by attention to victualling ventilation, &c. It is just 100 years since Howard and Dr. Letsom exposed the horrible condition of prisons, and succeeded in bringing about a thorough reformation in them. What was then done for sailors and prisoners must now be done for the working classes by sanitary legislation. Such as was the condition of prisons in this country at the time of Howard, is now to be seen in the homes of the people. Dr. Letsom's description of a prison, may even be applied to many of the squalid dens of misery where the destitute and neglected poor live, under a centralized and costly poorlaw management. He declared that "no place of the same dimensions could be better devised for destroying the life and health of his fellow-creatures." "Some prisons," he said, "had bad water, or none at all; the air was tainted, light denied them, so that prisoners literally rotted in close rooms, cells or dungeons." We have but to substitute these words to express what can be seen any time in visiting some of the homes of the destitute poor. A dingy back room, perhaps a kitchen, or an attic, with a cubic air-space for breathing of 700 to 1100 cubic feet, in which are lodged a man, wife, and from two to five children; the air, as well as their garments and bedding, pregnant with dirt and infection, from want of soap, water, and proper utensils for washing; drinking-water stands for hours in this close atmosphere before it is used. But it is now illegal for a prisoner to live in this manner; the cell has not less than 800 to 1000 cubic feet of space; he has food enough, and ventilation according to season, he is in perfect health, and contagious diseases are unknown.
