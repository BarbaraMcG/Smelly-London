The Report of Special Committee Re Petition of Dustmen, Sweepers, See., was brought up as follows: To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Report of Special Committee, Re Petition of Dustmen, Sweepers, &c. Wednesday, 13th April, 1892. Your Committee beg to report— (1) That they have met on a number of occasions to consider the matters referred to. (2) That the petition of the dustmen, slopmen, sweepers, fillerinmen, lurnacemen and sifters, may be considered fairly under two heads. The one dealing with the nature of the employment and details of management, and the other with the wages of the work-people. (3) Dealing first with the more general subject, your Committee beg to report that they have caused the whole of the persons referred to in the petition to come before them, each class separately, and invited each class to fully state any grievance which any one might have, at the same time promising that nothing which was said should interfere detrimentally with the interest of the person making it. (4) That with regard to the request that the persons should be placed upon weekly work, your Committee do not recommend that such should be done. (5) Your Committee after carefully examining the men on the subject, do not find that the statement in the petition "that the men have been put off on account of the weather” has in any way been substantiated. 65 8 JUNE, 189 2. (6) Your Committee also find that almost without exception every man was aware that he could go before the Dusting and Cleansing Committee, and place any grievance which he might have before that Committee, which meets every Monday. (7) That your Committee also beg to report that no case was stated to have occurred of any man having been thrown out of employment for a trifling offence. (8) The men also stated that they were aware that they could at any time appeal to the Surveyor. (9) That your Committee beg to report that they do not see their way to recommend the granting of a week's holiday as asked. (10) That on the other heading with regard to the increase of wages, your Committee propose to consider the subject under the various classes of workmen. (11) Your Committee find from information supplied by many of the Boards of London at the request of your Committee, that the mode of payment and the time worked varies very considerably throughout London to all classes. (12) As to Sweepers.—The wages paid to sweepers in Mile End is 3/8 per day, and the time worked about 59 hours per week, and in other parishes ranges from 6d. per hour and 58½ hours per week in Bermondsey, to 18/- to 19/- per week with about 59 hours per week in Hammersmith. (13) That your Committee find that in many of the parishes, able-bodied men are required, whilst in Mile End it is not absolutely necessary that they should be so. (14) After careful consideration of the whole subject your Committee cannot see their way to recommend that the petition of the sweepers to be paid 25/- per week should be granted, but recommend—That the wages of the Gangers of the sweepers be increased from 4/4 to 4/8 per day, and the Sweepers from 3/8 to 3/10 per day. (15) As to Drivers of Slop Carts.—The wages in Mile End of this class is 4/4 per day, the hours being about 59 hours per week. (16) The highest wages again appear to be paid in Bermondsey, namely 5/- per day, whilst in Shoreditch it is 3/6 per day of 10 hours. (17) That your Committee find that the standard rate of wages of the Workmen's Union is 28/- per week for a carman with two horses, and 24/- for a carman with one horse, but the men stated that there was a separate Union of men connected with parochial work whose standard rate was 30/- 66 8 JUNE, 1892. (18) Your Committee came to the conclusion that they could not recommend the granting of the prayer of the petition for 30/- per week, but do recommend—That the wages of the Slop-drivers be increased from 4/4 to 4/6 per day. (19) as to the persons employed at the dust yard. —Your Committee find that there is a first class and a second class furnaceman, receiving respectively 4/4 and 4/- per day, who apply to receive 28/- per week, which your Committee do not recommend be granted, but do recommend—That the wages of each be increased 2d. per day. (20) The men employed in the Dust Yard now receiving 3/6 per day, who ask to receive 26/- per week, your Committee find are deserving of particular consideration, both from the nature of their employment and their physical requirements, and therefore resolved to recommend—That their wages be increased from 3/6 to 3/10 per day. (21) Your Committee also came to the conclusion that the women engaged in sifting were not sufficiently paid, and resolved to recommend—That their wages be increased from 1/10 to 2/2 per day. (22) As to Dustmen, who ask that their wages should be 26/per week, your Committee find that except one gang paid bv the week, they are at present paid piece-work at 1 /2 per load. (23) The variation of this class of work is perhaps more marked than any. In St. Giles', Camberwell, the amount paid being 7½d. per load, whilst in Bermondsey it is 6d. per hour, and in Hackney 2/8 per day. (24) Your Committee determined that it would be better to adhere to the method now in force, and recommend—That the wages of those paid piece-work be increased from 1/2 to 1/4 per load. (25) That your Committee recommend—That all classes be paid 6d. per hour overtime. (26) That your Committee recommend—That the sweepers and the slop drivers shall leave off at One o'clock on Saturdays. Signed f. g. martin. wm. catmur. h. t. a. chidgey.

Of the eight selected candidates presented to the Board from which to elect two officers, not one possessed "First Class Honors Certificates for Building Construction," nor yet "First Class Honors Certificates for Hygiene;" one of them, Mr. Twaits, holds a Second Class Honors for both these subjects, and he is the one chosen in addition to Mr. Lyon. Mr. Lyon also holds a Second Class advanced Certificate for Building Construction, and is quite prepared to sit for the Sanitary Science Examination, when it is next holden. He is a man of good education, and possesses exactly the experience to fit him for his office, and is now performing his duties to the entire satisfaction of our very active Medical Officer of Health. 93 22 JUNE, 1892. If there have been any public meetings protesting against the Vestry's action, they would have been initiated by Mr. Richardson or the party he represents. To Mr. Richardson's profession "that he has no motive to serve," no comment is offered. To Mr. Richardson's three objections to Mr. Lyon's appointment—1st, "That he does not possess a Sanitary Science Certificate:" The Act does not demand it till 1895, whereas he will obtain it as before stated. 2nd, "That he is lame:" This is true, but it is of a simple character, and has never prevented him ascending ladders and scaffolding in discharging his duty as "Clerk of Works. 3rd, "That his election was partial because of his father having been a member of the Vestry," is not true. The Board therefore trusts you will approve its selection. After considerable discussion, The amendment was submitted to a show of hands and there were In favour 33 votes Against 17 „ A division was demanded and upon such division there were In favour of the amendmemt—Messrs.

Druitt, Emery, Hancock, Harris, Lawson, Moffatt, A. Moore, Ockelford, Richardson.—15 votes. The Chairman declared the amendment carried, and upon it being submitted as a substantive motion, it was Moved by Mr. Brown seconded by Mr. Browning as an amendment—That with regard to the letter sent by Mr. Richardson to the Local Government Board, this Vestry admits that Mr. Lyon, when appointed, was the son of a Vestryman; that he is lame; and that he is not at present so well qualified as some of the candidates who were unsuccessful.

The Report of Special Committee appointed to examine the Books with reference to the amount owing for Dust, &c., was brought up as follows: To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town, Report of Special Committee Appointed to examine the Books with reference to the Amount owing for Dust, &c. Wednesday, 27th April, 1892. Your Committee beg to report that, pursuant to the following Resolution of the Vestry of the 30th March, 1892, viz.: "That a Committee of urgency be appointed to examine the "books with reference to amounts owing for dust, etc., and "that the Committee do meet at 10 a.m. to-morrow;" they met at 10 a.m. on Thursday, the 31st March, 1892, and proceeded to ascertain the amount of balance standing to the respective accounts in the Ledger, and then adjourned. That your Committee again met at 5.30 in the evening of the same day and made a minute examination of the accounts, taking the books page by page, whereupon some matters ot detail were brought under consideration, which, in the opinion of your Committee, called for some explanation by the Accountants, and it was resolved to invite Messrs. Wilde and Venables' attendance at the next meeting ot the Committee. That your Committee met on the 6th April, 1892, at 5.30 p.m., at which sitting Mr. Wilde was in attendance and made answer to the various questions put to him respecting the Accounts, and also as to the mode ot keeping them. 100 6 JULY, 1892. With reference to the Accounts under head of "Credit Sales," Mr. Wilde stated that that part of the Accounts had not been dealt with by him, as for the purpose of the Annual Report and in compliance with the Act, 18 & 19 Vic., c. 120, s. 192, an Account of "Receipts and Expenditure" only is ordered, and as such Sales do not come under either of the above headings he has had no knowledge of them until payment for the same has been made. Respecting the "mode" of keeping the Accounts, Mr. Wilde informed the Committee that though he considered the Accounts were perfectly accurate, yet the system in some respects was not the best, and also that he had gradually and now almost completely inducted an improved method of keeping the Vestry's Accounts. Your Committee requested the Accountants to prepare and present at their next meeting a "Report upon the present position of the books of Account of the Vestry, as to their being accurately kept, and that they furnish a list of the Assets therein recorded;" your Committee then adjourned. That your Committee met on the 21st April, 1892, at 5.30 p.m., when in response to the request of the Committee the report of Messrs. Wilde & Venables was presented; the said report was read and discussed, whereupon it was resolved that the report be enbodied herewith, and presented to this Vestry in its entirety; the said report is as follows: To the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Sir, 1. In accordance with the resolution of the Finance Committee, requesting us "To report to the Committee upon the present state of the Books of the Vestry, as to their being accurately kept, and that we be asked to make a periodical examination of the amounts owing to the Vestry." 2. We have to report that we find the Books of the Vestry are now accurately kept. 3. We must remark, however, that we did not consider the system we found in force when we were first instructed to Audit the Books satisfactory, and we took steps at that time to bring into use a better method which has been gradually adopted, but not yet completely 101 6 JULY, 1892. in all the Books. We did not think it necessary to rewrite all the entries or to incur the expense of newBooks. 4. We note the Committee wish us to make a periodical examination of the amounts owing to the Vestry, and we should be obliged by their advice, whether this is to be quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly. 5. With a view to reporting the amount owing to the Vestry at the end of the Financial year the 25th March, 1892, we have inspected two Books marked "Vestry Dust Ledger," which may be considered " Day Books," shewing the quantities of Ashes, etc., sent away. 6. As the first of these Books included items of various dates, we thought it better to make our examination from the commencement of the Book October 1885, and we have traced the entries from this date into the Ledgers, and the Cash Received in respect to them from the Cash Book, and find these entries to be accurately made. 7. There are, however, some cases in which the Stuff in the "Vestry Dust Ledger" is not brought to the Debit of anyone, and we understand that in these cases no charge is made for the materials which are described as "Sweepings," "Rough Dust," "Hard Core" and "Clinkers." 8. Many pages of the Book are taken up with particulars of the quantities sent to the Great Eastern Railway who make a charge to the Vestry for carriage and disposal of it. 9. There are in use two Ledgers, some accounts being open in both. In those cases in which an account with the same person was open in both, we have now transferred the balances from the old to the new Ledger, so as to have all the particulars together. 10. We beg to forward herewith a Schedule of the amounts we find owing to the Vestry according to the Ledger on the 25th March, 1892. We are unable, however, to express an opinion, or to estimate what may be the real value of these assets, some of the amounts have since been paid, as noted. 11. There is some refuse sold by the Vestry which has not been entered in the "Vestry Dust Ledger," such as bones, iron, and glass, but which appear on the counter-foils of the Sold notes. We think it would be as well to bring these into this Book, as well as the charges for hire of Steam Roller. 102 6 JULY, 1892. 12. We would suggest for the future the "Vestry Dust Ledger" be called "Day Book," and that a separate book be kept and marked "Sold Ledger," in which all materials disposed of, and amounts chargeable by the Vestry be entered against the person who has to pay for them, in monthly totals from the Day Book, and the Cash, when paid, will be posted into this Book from the Cash Book, the balance due at any period will always be shown. We will arrange the Book-keeping of the Clerk's Department to work in with this. 13. In some cases where small sales are made for Cash, it is scarcely worth while to open a separate account to each individual in the Ledger, but there should be an account headed "Cash Sales" in which such transactions ought to appear. We are, Sir, Yours obediently, (Signed) WILDE & VENABLES. 69, Moorgate Street. 20th April, 1892. That your Committee find from their examination and the schedule referred to in Messrs. Wilde & Venables' report, the sum of £644 9s. 8d. standing in the Ledger to the credit of the Vestry, of which £50 8s. 6d. is for hire of steam roller. That, in the opinion of your Committee, it would be advisable that the Accountants supply to the No. 1 Committee every three months an abstract of Accounts, shewing all monies due to the Vestry, and also that a Day-Book in lieu of the present Account Book called Dust Ledger, be kept in the Surveyor's Department, and your Committee beg to so recommend. That your Committee found the Ledger was not closeposted, yet was in course of completion for the purposes of the Annual Report and Audit, in every other respect the Accounts were accurate, although some Accounts would appear to have been overlooked. Your Committee are also of opinion, and beg to so recommend, that in cases where contra accounts occur, the debtor to the Vestry should be called upon to hand over his cheque in settlement of his contra account at the same time as the Vestry's cheque is given in settlement of its liability. That in those cases where the debtor has no account against the Vestry, your Committee beg to recommend that those accounts should not be allowed to remain unpaid for so long a period as in some cases they have been allowed so to do, 103 6 JULY, 1892. and that the No. 1 Committee be instructed to take the necessary measures for the carrying out of this recommendation. Signed henry cushen. charles lacey. h. t. a. chidgey. Moved by Mr. Cushen seconded by Mr. Furness and resolved —That the Report be received. Moved by Mr. Cushen seconded by Mr. Birks and resolved —That the Report be adopted, and it was resolved accordingly. VII. The Report of Special Committee re Mr. Churchwarden Coker's right to attend meetings of the Vestry, was brought up as follows: To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Report of Special Committee, Re Mr. Churchwarden Coker's right to attend meetings of the Vestry. Wednesday, June 8th, 1892. Your Committee beg to report that they met on Friday the 3rd inst., there being present Messrs. Peacock Cushen, Davis, Crockford, and Brown. That your Committee considered Section 2 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, which contains the following proviso: "Provided also that the incumbent and churchwardens "of each such Parishes shall constitute a part of the "Vestry and shall vote therein in addition to the elected "Vestrymen." That a reference to ascertain the meaning of the words "such parishes" shows that they refer to the parishes mentioned in schedules A and B to the Act, one of those in schedule A being this Hamlet. The Committee would point out that the Rector of Stepney has always been considered to have a right to attend the meetings of the Vestry, and receives a summons for every meeting. That the Churchwardens have important duties to perform is shewn by the various Sections of the Act dealing with the Elections of Vestrymen, &c., as they are thereby constituted the Returning Officers. That a reference to precedent shews that between the years 1866 and 1869, Mr. Edward Lionel Johnson was one of the Churchwardens of this Hamlet, and during two years he 104 6 JULY, 1892. was nearly always elected to take the Chair at the Vestry meetings, and was elected a member of one of the Committees, and generally acted as a Vestryman in all ways, and yet he was not an elected Vestryman. That taking all the circumstances into consideration, your Committee came to the conclusion that taking counsel's opinion would be incurring unnecessary cost, and therefore resolved to recommend—That 110 further steps be taken in the matter. Signed o. w. PEACOCK. HENRY CUSHEN. JOHN BROWN. Moved by Mr. Cushen seconded by Mr. T. Cook and resolved —That the Report be received. Moved by Mr. Cushen seconded by Mr. Upton—That the Report be adopted. Moved by Mr. Brown seconded by Mr. Catmur as an amendment—That Counsel's opinion be taken on the matter. The amendment was submitted to a show of hands and the Chairman declared it lost, and then submitted the motion and declared it carried, and it was resolved accordingly. VIII.

"Sir, "Main Roads—Maintenance. "The Council has again had under consideration "the question of the amount which it should contribute "towards the cost of the maintenance of the main road "in the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town, vested in the "Council by the Local Government Act, 1888. "Some time ago the Vestry requested the Council to "join in a submission of the matter for the arbitration of "the Local Government Board; but, at the suggestion of "the Council, the Vestry agreed to wait until the Board's "award should have been given in the case already sub"mitted with reference to the maintenance during the "year ended 31st March, 1890, of the main roads in the "parish of Hampstead, as it was thought that this might "form the basis for settlement of the claims of other "local authorities. "This award was given in March last, and as will be "seen upon reference to the Minutes of the Council of "12th April, amounts to less than one half of the total "cost of the maintenance of the roads for the year "referred to, as put before the arbitrator. "With a view to this award serving as a basis for the "settlement of the other similar claims, the Council has "endeavoured, but without success, to ascertain from the "Local Government Board the method adopted in "arriving at the sum named in the award. The Council has now decided to make the following "offer :—That, subject to the provisions of section 11 of "the Local Government Act, 1888, the Council shall pay "annually to the Vestry of Mile End Old Town as the "Council's contribution towards the cost of maintenance "and repair of the main road in the Hamlet of Mile End "Old Town, a sum equal to one half of the average "ctual annual cost during the three years ended 31st "March, 1892, of maintenance and repair, to be ascertained "and agreed upon between the Council and the Vestry, such "contribution to commence as from 1st April, 1889, and "to continue until 31st March, 1896, or until such time "as the Council's legal position with reference to that " road shall be altered. " I have to ask that you will be good enough to lay this " letter before the Vestry of Mile End Old Town, and to let 216 9 NOVEMBER, 1892.

That your Committee felt that the whole of the facts having been so often discussed of late on the Board, that it is unnecessary again to repeat them, and therefore simply recommend— (a) That the Vestry do proceed at its next meeting to reappoint Charles Cox who held office before the 1st January, 1892, as Sanitary Inspector, to be the Sanitary Inspector for the No. 1 District, viz.: that portion of the North Ward East of Globe Road and the whole of the East Ward of the Hamlet.

(e) That the requisite notice of the intention to make such reappointment be inserted on the Agenda for the next meeting of the Vestry. (10) That with regard to Lewin's Buildings, &c., your Committee think that it would be well to shortly state the facts of the case, which were as follows: Your Medical Officer of Health in February and March, 1891, made representations to your Committee under the provisions of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, that No. 6, Adelina Grove and Nos. 1, 2 and 3, Lewin's Buildings were Obstructive Buildings under the Act. That your Committee thereupon determined to view the premises, and having done so, came to the conclusion that the block of buildings irom the East side of Sidney Street, in- 23 NOVEMBER, 1892. 235 cluding the property on the East side of Lewin's Buildings, were an area which should be properly dealt with under Section 39 of the Act, and accordingly on the 5th August, 1891, recommended your Board to pass the requisite Resolutions. Upon the Report being brought up, consideration of the matter was adjourned for seven weeks, and on October 2nd, 1891, the matter was referred to a Committee of the Whole Board for consideration and report. The Committee of the Whole Board surveyed the site, and on the 14th October, 1891, presented a Report to the Vestry that the insanitary matters existing in the area could be dealt with under the sanitary provisions of the Act, and recommended that it was inadvisable to pass the Resolutions recommended by your Committee. The Representations having being sent, pursuant to statute, to the London County Council, were referred to the Public Health and Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the Council, who have kept the matter in view, and (the Vestry not having taken any steps dealing with either of the houses in the Representation as Obstructive Buildings,) on the nth October, 1892, gave notice to the Vestry that unless the Vestry proceeded within a month to deal with Xos. 2 and 3 Lewin's Buildings as Obstructive Buildings, the Committee would recommend the Council to take proceedings in default. That having regard to the various questions which existed, your Committee deemed it advisable that they should have power to confer with the Committee of the Council upon the matter, and on the 26th October, 1892, it was so recommended to the Vestry, and the Vestry adopted the recommendation. That your Committee met a Sub-Committee of the Council Committee on the spot, and inspected not only the two houses referred to, but also the surrounding property. That your Committee on Monday the 14th inst. again waited upon the Council Committee at Spring Gardens and had a lengthy discussion on the subject matter, and received from the Chairman an unofficial promise that the Committee would recommend the Council to grant the usual contribution in case the Vestry should see fit to carry out the Improvement Scheme, rather than merely to pull down the two Obstructive Buildings. That your Committee have, therefore, again gone into the subject matter, and consider that although the cost will undoubtedly be considerably more, nevertheless a much greater advantage would be derived by the carrying out of the Scheme, rather than to pull down two Obstructive Buildings; and accordingly recommend- 236 23 NOVEMBER, 1892. That the Vestry pass the requisite Resolutions and direct a scheme to be prepared under Section 39 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, for the improvement of the area comprising a small block of buildings in Sidney Street, Lewin's Buildings, and Adelina Grove, as shewn on a plan which will be submitted to the Vestry. (11) That your Committee beg to report that summonses were taken out against the owners of the following premises with regard to the non-performance of sanitary works ordered by your Board, with the following results: (a) Nos. 15, Sidney Street, and 57, Greenfield Street—The works having been performed by the day of hearing, the summonses were withdrawn.

(9) That your Medical Officer submitted a full Report on, and 326 1 MARCH, 1893. your Committee considered the question of the removal of non-pauper patients referred by your Board. That it appears from the Report of your Medical Officer that the removal of these cases has to take place at all hours of the night and day, including Sundays, as any delay in some cases might result in most serious consequences; and that, except on Sundays, if the removal takes place between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m., communication is made by telephone to the chief offices of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and after that time by telegraph to the Ambulance Stations, and that on Sundays it is always made by telegraph to the Ambulance Stations. If the Vestry undertake the duty, it will be necessary to provide a telephone, and one or more persons must always be on duty. This would involve a very serious expense.

In the first case, the child having died suddenly an inquest was held, and the true nature of the disease was discovered. In the second case, the cause of death admitted of no doubt, and your Medical Officer deemed it inadvisable that the body should be removed to the Mortuary, there being no satisfactory provision there for cases of infectious disease, but considered that it ought to be buried immediately. Some difficulty having arisen with regard to this course, your Medical Officer attended at the Police Court with a view of getting the Magistrate's order for the immediate burial, when the persons responsible for the burial promised to bury the child within twenty-four hours, which your Medical Officer agreed to, and the body was buried accordingly. The premises were disinfected the same day that the child was buried, and every possible precaution taken against the disease spreading.

To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in again laying before you in tabulated form the various works which have been carried out under the supervision of my department during the year ending 25th March last. It will be generally seen that there has been an increase in every department of labour, which has arisen from the general increase of wages and the shortening of hours. CARRIAGEWAY PAVING. The carriageway of Harford Street and Ben Jonson Road have been relaid with new stone. This work was done under contract by Mr. Wheeler at a cost of .£5,997 4s. 9d. PAVING WORKS.

The quantity collected was 15,983 loads. The quantity collected was 17,810 loads, being an increase of 1,827 loads on last year. This is equal to about 2/7¾ per load for collection and carting. This is equal to about 2/84/5 per load for collection and cartage. This is equal to about 2/10¼ per load for collection and cartage. 392 DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. It will be observed that there has been a large increase in the quantity of refuse collected, but at the same time the amount of marketable material has greatly decreased. Taken upon the whole, the demand for ashes has been good, although during the autumn a large quantity had to be sent to shoot. The quantity of ashes and breeze sifted and put on rail was 10,637 tons, and 720 tons were loaded into barges and sold for brick making purposes. 2,868 tons were loaded into barges and sent to Shoot. 830 tons of rough dust were disposed of by rail and 1,113 tons of clinkers were removed free of charge from the Wharf.

The cost of cleansing the sewers by your own workmen was £579 10s. 10d. The cost of jobbing sewers work was £839 9s. 3d. The old sewer in Baker Street and Nelson Street has been broken up and a new pipe sewer laid in its place; the cost of this work was .£386 1s. 8d. One hundred and thirteen houses have been connected with the sewers of this Hamlet during the year. The flushing tanks, one at Sidney Street and the other at Cannon Street Road, have effectually kept the sewer in the Commercial Road clear. The cost of putting in a new invert to the Commercial Road sewer and the construction of two flushing chambers was £3,189 15s. 4d., of which the Vestry paid one moiety, viz.: £1,594 17s. 8d.

VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. annual report UPON THE PUBLIC HEALTH, AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1892, BY THOMAS TAYLOR Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED BY E. S. WHEATLEY, 176, MILE END ROAD, E. 1895. the thirty-seventh ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Year 1892. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you for your perusal my Annual Report of the Vital Statistics together with the result of the Public Health work which has been carried out during the past twelve months in this Hamlet. Under the Order of the Local Government Board my Report to you is for the period from January to December 1892, so that this Report will be in advance of General Report of the Vestry. VITAL STATISTICS. The Vital Statistics of any district, in order to be of use for comparison with statistics of past years, must be in ratio to the population, as intercensal periods are of such long intervals as ten years, it is difficult to form a true and accurate basis to work on, but as it was only last year that the census was taken we can judge fairly accurately our population. I estimate the population of Mile End Old Town in the middle of the year 1892 as 107,811, this calculation is worked on the same basis as that of the Registrar General by logarithms, and is 248 more than the population taken at the time of the census. It is a well-known fact that our present population will vary but little, seeing that the whole of the district is built over, there being at the present time very little available land eligible, or that is likely to be used for building purposes, the only way we 4 have been increasing our populaton the last ten years is by several families occupying one house that used to be inhabited by only one family; this is much to be regretted seeing that the majority of these houses consist of not more than five rooms each. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. The Births registered during the 52 weeks ending December 31st were 4,035 as the following table will show. The Births for the year 1891 were 4,109 giving a birth-rate equal to 38.2 per 1,000 so that it will be seen that this year has been a normal one as far as Births are concerned. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE FOR THE FOUR QUARTERS 1892. Quarter. Males. Females. Total. Birth-Rate. 1st 509 516 1,025 38.0 2nd 563 531 1,094 40.5 3rd 478 474 952 35.3 4 th 492 472 964 35.7 Total 2,042 1,993 4,035 37.5 DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The number of Deaths from all causes registered during the year 1892 was 2,489, this number is arrived at after making the deduction of those Deaths that occurred in our district but who belong to other parishes, and including those Deaths that occurred in the various Public Institutions outside our Parish but belong to Mile End Old Town. This number is equivalent to a Death-Rate of 23.0 per 1,000 per annum that of the Metropolis being 20.2, so that our Death-Rate is 0.8 per 1,000 higher than London taken as a whole; it will be noticed that about 200 more Deaths occurred in our district than in the year 1891 but this number is so insignificant that one cannot possibly account for it; from the table below it will be noticed that we compare very favourably with other East End districts and seeing that a large majority of our population belong to the poorer classes we may consider our Death-Rate of 23.0 per 1,000 per annum very satisfactory.

Zymotic diseases are those infectious or contagious diseases which are such a scourge to this country ; when the population of districts is small they are more easily dealt with, but when they occur in large closely-built and populous neighbourhoods like our own, it is extremely difficult to prevent their spread, when we have anything like an epidemic; the fact that any cases of Small Pox, Fevers, or Diphtheria, whether pauper or non-pauper can be received in the Asylums' Board's Hospitals at any time, prevents in a great measure the spread of these diseases; the treatment which the patient receives in these Public Institutions is so efficient and the frequent notification to their friends of their condition from time to time, has helped to break down the prejudice that at first existed, and so we are enabled to take away from many homes the centre of infection and thus prevent other members of the same family, or persons living in the same house from running the risk of being attacked with these diseases. SMALL POX. We have had ten cases reported during the year. The first case was that of a woman who went to the London Hospital and was removed to the Hospital Ships, I visited the home of the patient and found that she had occupied one room with her two children, these children had been removed to the Workhouse Infirmary suffering from a rash; 1 at once communicated with the Medical Officer of the Workhouse but found 6 they were not suffering from Small Pox, I had a letter from the Superintendent of the Hospital Ships stating the mother was not suffering from this disease but from an ill-defined form of fever. The next case was that of a child two years of age residing at No. 6, North Square, the doctor who notified the case asked me to visit the patient to confirm his diagnosis, although this is no part of my duty, I did so and found it to be a very bad case of confluent Small Pox. I found there were in this small house eleven children and four adults, the case was at once removed to the Hospital and the premises thoroughly disinfected, I may mention the fact that this child was unvaccinated. Another case occurred in the same house five weeks later also a child, on again visiting the premises I found the patient was too ill to be removed, and so it had to be treated at home; a few days after this an adult lodger in the same house was attacked she was at once removed to the Hospital, there could be no doubt as to the source of infection of these last two cases seeing the mother of these children had been allowed to visit the Hospital Ship seven times in five weeks. The next case occurred at a hairdresser's establishment in Grove Road, on visiting the house I advised the patient's removal as isolation could not be carried out, whereupon the husband of the patient called a second doctor in to see the case and he stated the case was not one of Small Pox; I was requested to see the case which I did and confirmed the second doctor's opinion. On August 22 three cases were reported from Gray Street, these cases were treated at their homes and no other case occurred in the neighbourhood. The last notification during the year was at Walden Street, the medical man attending asked me to see the case and I found it was one of Chicken Pox. The fact that a number of cases notified to me as Small Pox have turned out to be Varicella indicates that Small Pox is much less prevalent than it was a few years ago, as there are many medical men of the present day who have scarcely seen a case of Variola. SCARLET FEVER. The number of Scarlet Fever cases notified to me during the past twelve months were far in excess of any year since the Notification Act came into force, in fact we have had an epidemic of this disease in our district, which epidemic has been common to the whole of the Metropolis; it will be seen that the highest number of cases of this disease occurring in our district at a particular time was in August and September ; I attribute the spread of this disease all over the Hamlet to the fact that it was of such a mild type that in many cases no notice was taken of it until the children commenced to peel, and then it was 7 that the medical man was called in, the mortality which occurred in comparison to the number of cases was remarkably small shewing that the epidemic was not of a malignant type; I may say that every means was taken that lay in our power to prevent the spread of this disease, notices were sent to the various schools in all cases where children were attending the school from the house where the patient was attacked, the sanitary condition of the house was examined and notices left as to disinfection to be carried out, and in 70 per cent. of the cases notified disinfection was done by our men under my superintendence. TYPHOID FEVER. The number of cases of this disease notified during the year was 78, as against 101 the year previous. Although one cannot positively say that defective drainage is the actual cause of this disease, it no doubt is a great factor in disceminating it when the disease has occurred in any locality, and I have in several of my previous Reports stated that in all cases the drainage ought to thoroughly tested, but owing to the smallness of our staff that has been impossible, when however in June last the staff was increased to three Inspectors in all the cases that have occurred since that date we have applied the smoke test to the drains of the infected houses with the result that in the 46 drains tested 20 of them were found to be defective; notices were served and the defects remedied under the personal superintendence of the Inspectors; although this way of testing drains is to my mind the most effectual it entails a large amount of time and labour, the cost of the actual test is nominal, the expense being in the labour as we have to have two labourers to wheel from place to place the machine and work the apparatus, but I consider the results as stated above more than compensates for the time expended. DIPHTHERIA. This disease has been more recognised as such during the last few years; we have had 256 cases notified to us during the year 1892, a number of these have been of so mild a type that it is probable that they were simply sore throats, as in many of these cases when the Inspectors and myself have visited the houses the occupants have expressed their surprise at hearing for the first time their children were supposed to be suffering from this disease; undoubtedly a large number of the cases were genuine Diphtheria and precautions were taken by us in all the cases as regards disinfection, and in notifying to the various schools where the children from the house attended. As in Tyhoid Fever defective drainage plays a very important part in spreading this disease and since our staff of Inspectors has been increased we have been enabled to have the drains tested in every house where this disease existed, with the result that out of 127 cases that the smoke test was applied, in 36 of them the drainage was found to be defective, these defects have now been remedied. 8 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED BY VARIOUS MEDICAL MEN DURING THE YEAR 1892.

During the past year we have been startled by the fact that this disease was in close proximity to London, in fact several cases in August last were found to have occurred on one of the ships coming from Hamburg, but thanks to the prompt measures taken by the Local Government Board, the disease did not make any headway, that Body at once issued an Order to prevent the importation of the destitute pauper aliens from Hamburg and other ports. Under this Order, which applied to all ships infected with Cholera, no alien of the class indicated which arrived in English ports was allowed to land until they had furnished the proper authorities with their full name, destination, and precise address, so that they could be traced and kept under observation for such time as might be judged sufficient. After this they must satisfy the medical officer of health of their freedom from any suspicion of choleraic disease before they were allowed to leave the ship; the penalty for non-compliance with this regulation being a fine of £50. As it is only in a few instances that these poor outcasts have any precise destination, the practical effect of the Order was that the great majority of them were refused permission to land. Under these circumstances the shipping agencies, whose profit out of such passengers is very small, soon ceased to import them. The Order appeared to be well devised to meet the necessities of the situation without interfering more than was necessary with the traditional hospitality which (whether wisely or not it is not within my province to discuss) makes this free country a harbour of refuge for those flying from political oppression or religious persecution. On August 25th a circular letter from the Local Government Board was sent to all the local sanitary authorities calling their attention to the necessity of being prepared for the appearance of this disease in their district, and should it do so they would issue their regulations as per Section 82 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which would impose on the local authorities the necessity of making provision for the preventing and treatment of the disease. On August 17th a case of Cholera was reported to me from Oxford Street, Stepney. I at once visited the premises and found the patient had died after only being ill three days. I called on the medical man who notified the case and alter going into the details of the illness with him, he altered his views ol the case and called it Choleraic Diarrhoea. Every means was taken as regards the disinfection of the premises and clothing, and to ensure early burial, as would be in the more grave disease. A Local Government Board Inspector came down and went into the facts of the case and approved of the measures had adopted The fact that no other suspicious case took place (for a large number of people including children occupied the house) made it very improbable that it was genuine Cholera. Another 12 case was reported a few days later but upon going into the matter it was found to be one of excessive Diarrhoea only. I went away for my holidays on August 20th and on seeing in the papers a few days later that several cases of Cholera were reported to have occurred amongst the passengers in one of the ships lying in the Thames I at once returned to London and had the Sanitary Committee summoned to consider the position. I brought up a Report stating that I had made arrangements with the London Hospital to receive any first cases that might occur in our district, and the Committee authorised me to get a special vehicle for removing the cases if necessary and to take what steps I considered advisable. On the same day alter the meeting I received a telegram from the Local Government Board stating that emigrants were about to land at Blackwall from a ship that had Cholera cases on board; I prepared to meet these people on landing and to take their names and addresses, but later in the day I received a second telegram stating that the ship was placed in quarantine below Gravesend. On August 30th a number of emigrants did land in our district from a ship recently coming from Hamburg, a list of their addresses was sent by the Local Government Board to us and the people were kept under our observation for a time, but happily no case of sickness occurred among them. Since that date and up to the present time the Port Sanitary Authority have reported to us the names and addresses of a number of persons who contemplated lodging in our district having come from Hamburg. Our Inspectors have promptly visited the premises to verify the same and no case of any illness has occurred although we have had 43 people notified as coming to our district. It is expected that in the Soring of 1893 this disease will be in our midst but 1 trust that the provision that is being made in London and in our district will prevent it becoming any serious moment to us. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. During the past year this department has undergone much revision and extension. In the early part of the year the Sanitary Committee took into consideration a Special Report made by me as to the inadequacy of our staff to carry out the Public Health (London) Act, and as a result the Board appointed a Clerk for the purpose of relieving the Inspectors of tne more onerous part of their clerical work, the officer appointed was Mr. Cox, Jun., who has carried out his duty to my entire satisfaction. In the month of March the senior Inspector, Mr. Leshaw, died suddenly, he was much respected, and had been a very valuable officer for something like twenty-five years. This event led to a reconsideration of increasing our staff of Inspectors. In my Annual Reports for several years past I have stated and brought the matter before the Vestry from time to time that our staff was very inadequate; this has of late years been more apparent as new Acts of Parliament imposing 13 tional duties have recently been passed, to carry out which efficiently could not be done by the same staff as we formerly had; the vestry took these facts into consideration with the result that two Inspectors were appointed instead of one in June last, viz.: Mr. Lyon and Mr. T waits both of whom hold the certificates of the Sanitary Institute, and are competent and practical officers, and have carried out their duties to my satisfaction. I must not omit to say that Mr. Cox, had for a period of four months much additional work thrown upon him in consequence of Mr. Leshaw's death. These duties he discharged efficiently. Our staff now consists of three capable and industrious Inspectors and one Clerk, the Hamlet has been divided into three sanitary districts instead of two as you are aware. The Inspectors are all appointed under the Order of the Local Government Board of December, 1891. Mr. Cox, No. 1 District which comprises the whole of the East Ward and the portion of the North Ward east of Globe Road. Mr. Lyon, No. 2 District which comprises the whole of the Centre Ward and the part of the North Ward west of Globe Road. Mr. Twaits, No. 3 District which comprises the whole of the West and South Wards. I may mention that all three are also appointed to take samples under the Food and Drugs Act in their respective districts. THE SANITARY WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE YEAR. Section 1 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, states:— "That every Sanitary Authority shall cause from time "to time an inspection of their district to be made with "a view of ascertaining what nuisances exist calling for "abatement under the powers of the Act and to enforce "its provisions so as to secure the proper sanitary con"dition of all premises within their district. During the past year we have been engaged in carrying out a thorough systematic house to house inspection ot the Hamlet, and the various nuisances which were found to exist were brought to the notice of the Vestry who ordered the nuisances to be abated within 28 days from the date of the Older being served in ordinary cases, and in the case of stopped drains within 48 hours, and in the event of this not being carried out, proceedings to be taken; although the Vestry have limited the time for these Orders to be executed, we have not been arbitrary with this enforcement as it is our practice to use every endeavour to get the work done without undue pressure, and it is only in those 14 cases where no attempt had been made to comply with the Order of the Vestry that summonses were taken. I may say that the result of our action in the cases where proceedings were taken, has had a most salutary effect, the fact that so much work is being carried out with so little friction, table A speaks for itself, to do this it has required much patience, forbearance and tact on the part of your Officers. West Ward.—In this Ward we have had the greatest difficulty in keeping it in a sanitary condition. During the last year most of the populous streets have been inspected, not only the houses but in many cases the drainage has been overhauled and lasting improvements effected. There is no doubt there is a great deal of overcrowding in this Ward amongst the alien population and we experience the greatest difficulty in dealing with this state of things in consequence of a large portion of it being a moving one. If these people were taught habits of cleanliness before they arrived in this country we should have far less trouble in keeping their homes in a healthy condition. During the last year the alien population in this Ward has much increased but to what exact extent it is impossible to estimate. One cannot help being struck by the thriftiness of these people, coming over as they do with a mere bundle, and in a few weeks time seeing them carrying on their various businesses as though they had been here for years. In this Ward the area comprising Parfett Street and Firmin Place, two closely built courts, have been demolished by the London Hospital authorities and they now form the site of new Parfett Street. It is to be hoped that the same authority will treat the lower part of Romford Street in a similar manner and so give more light and air to the inhabitants of these dwellings. I may say that during the last few years a large number of small insanitary houses which took up a considerable portion of the Inspectors' time have now been pulled down and replaced with dwellings of a superior type. South Ward.—A large number of the houses in this Ward have been inspected and sanitary improvements effected, as a whole the houses in this Ward are in tairly sanitary condition. Centre Ward.—In this Ward we have our poorest inhabitants housed. A large portion of which has been inspected and reinspected during the last twelve months. A number of the houses in this Ward have been placed under Section 30 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act and I hope the Knott Street area will soon be in a fair way for being reconstructed under Part I. of the said Act. North Ward.—In this Ward we have a large number of the artizan class. A considerable portion has been inspected and lasting improvements made, the condition of the Ward as a whole is very fair. 15 East Ward.—In this Ward we have a large number of better class houses containing from six to eight rooms and occupied bv a very respectable class of people, part of this Ward is ot course inhabited by a poor class of people but they are for the most part cleanly and we find that when once the property has been placed in a sanitary condition it remains so for a much longer period than many parts of the Hamlet.

The duty of the inspection of Workshops relating to cleanliness, ventilation and overcrowding has by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, been transferred from the Local Government Board to the local sanitary authorities in London. It therefore becomes our duty to enforce the provisions of this Act and with that object we began in the early part of the year to search the Hamlet for these workshops, as there is no obligation on the part of the occupiers of workshops to notify their existence to us, it is only by house to house inspection throughout the Hamlet that we shall become acquainted with the whole ot the workshops in our district. We have, however, up to the present time upwards of 200 workshops under periodical inspection, and I may say that on the whole they are found to be clean; as to the ventilation very little artificial ventilation is used and in a number of cases overcrowding was found to exist. I think the reason of the latter defect is apparently that very tew employers have the slightest idea of the cubical air space required for each employee. All these workshops have been measured and a notice is being served stating the number of employees allowed to work at one time in such workshop; 250 cubical feet being the minimum that we require for each person; these are the requirements of the Local Government Board, which indeed is moderate enough; the measuring up of these workshops and working out of their cubical capacity has been a work of some magnitude. I am required by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 27, to give notice to the Factory Inspector of the district where women and children are employed at any workshop in our district, this Section has been complied with in all the required cases. A number ot these workshops have had notices served under Section 33 ot the Factory and Workshop Act in regard to cleansing the internal walls, ceilings, stairs and passages which have now been complied with. Section 38 of the Public Health (London) Act states that every workshop that employs male and female labour shall be provided with suitable sanitary conveniences tor both sexes. In 43 cases orders have been issued by the Vestry to comply with this Section of the Act which orders have been carried out. We now have a Register of all workshops which have come under our notice, and a continual record is kept ot the inspection and reinspection and the sanitary condition ot these premises. OUT-WORKERS. In October last an Order was issued by the Local Government Board to all sanitary authorities in the Metropolis stating that it was their duty to find out and frequently visit the homes of 20 the first cases reported under this section of the Act, the County Council might very well be asked to contribute a part of the cost. It is under Section 30 that most of the work has been carried out under part II. of this Act. This section states that it is the duty of the Medical Officer of Health to report any house which appears to him to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation in his district. I have made 91 representations to the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the Vestry during the past twelve months, and in all these cases the Committee have passed the necessary resolution that an Order be made on the owner to make such dwelling houses fit for human habitation. It then became the duty of your Clerk to ascertain the owner, a proceeding which very often involves considerable time and trouble, and serve the statutory notice. The work to be done is not specified in the Order, as the Act implies that an Owner ought to know when his house is fit for human habitation, but in most cases the owner applies to me for the particulars of the work required to be done, and needless to say, I am always glad to supply him with the required information so that he may comply with the Order of the Committee; when the time of the Order has expired I visit the premises and report to the Committee, and in some cases where the work is not carried out, the Committee visit the premises and authorise me to take proceedings to close the houses. I then take out the summons and the Clerk conducts the cases. During the past twelve months we have taken proceedings in fifteen cases to close the houses, in eight instances Closing Orders were made, and the other seven were adjourned for four weeks, when your Clerk and myself again appeared and the summonses were withdrawn, the houses having been made habitable in the meantime. The details of the various proceedings taken will be found in the Tables annexed. Although this method of dealing with insanitary houses involves considerable time and trouble, the results prove to be very satisfactory; the premises on which proceedings have been taken by me under the Act were in such a dilapidated condition as to be almost impossible to deal with them effectively under the Public Health Act. 18 out-workers, that is, all persons who take work from their employers home to complete. This Order will entail much more work than at first sight appears and will vary very much in different parishes. The method which I have adopted to find out these out-workers is by the Inspectors serving notices on all likely persons who give out-work in our district; these employers are bound to fill special Forms with the names and addresses of all their out-workers and post the same in a conspicuous place in their workshop. In our own district we have already found a large number of cases where the employer lives in our district and the employee in another sanitary district, no provision is made in the Order for this condition of things but 1 take it and am working on the assumption that it is our duty to bring to the notice of any other Vestry the names and addresses of and employees who may live in their district but who get their work from an employer in our district. We have also found that a large number of persons are scattered all over the Hamlet who are out-workers in our district, their homes will have to be frequently visited as per the Order. To what extent this frequent visiting of these places will interfere with our ordinary routine work it is difficult as yet to estimate, I am afraid it will need much time and attention, as a large number of our population are employed as out-workers by City and West End firms, and until we get the return from the various districts, we cannot tell how much extra time this duty will take. The beneficial results that will accrue from the carrying out of this Order cannot be over-estimated ; seeing that it will be the means of our being made aware not only of the sanitary condition of these houses where articles of wearing apparel are being manufactured, but also in preventing the spread of infectious disease, as I have no doubt very much infection is spread in this way. It seems to me had the Order gone a little farther and made it compulsory for employers of out-workers to notify the addresses of their employees to the various sanitary authorities, this would have greatly facilitated matters ; and the health of the public in general would be greatly benefited by such compulsory notification as in the case of infectious diseases occurring at these houses we should be able to notify to employers their existence and so prevent work being carried on until such houses were free from infection. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. The proceedings that have been taken under the above Act during the past year (with the exception of what has been before the Vestry in respcct to obstructive buildings) have not been reported to the Vestry, as the Sanitary Committee were appointed under the 81st Section of the above Act, to carry out the provisions of the said Act. It therefore becomes my duty to bring before you the details of the representations that I PROCEEDINGS TAKEN UNDER THE HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT.

The duty of licensing these places is in the province of the London County Council, though a copy of each application is forwarded to my department so that we may if necessary oppose the further granting of the license. I have always made it a practise to make a special visit to all the Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses in our district accompanied by the Sanitary Inspectors, this year formed no exception to the rule and we found these places kept for the most part in a cleanly condition, the cattle appeared healthy, so that we did not think it necessary in any case to oppose the re-granting of the licenses. I have not had during the past twelve months any disease of an infectious character amongst the cattle reported to me. BAKEHOUSES. We have a large number of Bakehouses in our district and the duty of specially inspecting them I have carried out myself; in several cases improvements have been effected in way of drainage and cleansing, but they are for the most part in a good sanitary condition, and with only one exception the most scrupulous cleanliness is carried out in the manufacture of the bread. I have now given you a resume of the work carried out under my direction during the past twelve months which I trust will be appreciated by all the Members of the Board ; I hope the good feeling which has hitherto existed between the Board and myself may continue, and with your co-operation in the future as in past years our Health Department may by its work go on improving the sanitary condition of the district, and so add to the comfort and longevity of the inhabitants of Mile End Old Town. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. .
