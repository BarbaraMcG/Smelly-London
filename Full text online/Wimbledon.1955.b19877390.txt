Borough of Wimbledon. Health Department ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the YEAR ENDED 31st DECEMBER, 1955 Printed by Raynes Park Press, Lambton Road, London, S.W.20. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1955 Health Department, Town Hall, Wimbledon, S.W.19. August, 1956. To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Wimbledon. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the work of the Health Department for the year 1955. This report is compiled in accordance with the instructions contained in Circular 1/54 of the Ministry of Health. The form of the report is similar to that for 1954 and is largely statistical in character. These statistics shew that, on the whole, 1955 was a very satisfactory year in so far as the health of the Borough was concerned. The corrected live birth rate for Wimbledon in 1955 was 12-91 per thousand of the population compared with a rate of 15.0 for England and Wales. The corrected death rate for the Borough during the period was 8.29 compared with a rate of 11.7 for England and Wales. This is, with one exception, the lowest death rate recorded in Wimbledon. 1 One maternal death occurred giving a maternal mortality rate of 1.27 per thousand live and still births. The infantile mortality rate for 1955 in Wimbledon shewed a further decline and was the second lowest on record. Eleven Wimbledon children under the age of one year died during the year, giving an infantile mortality rate of 14.08 per thousand live births compared with the rate of 24.9 for England and Wales. There was a spectacular fall in the still birth rate for the Borough. Eight children were stillborn out of a total of 789 births giving a still birth rate of 0.14 per thousand of the population. This figure is easily the lowest ever previously recorded in Wimbledon. The death rate from all forms of cancer was lower than in 1954 but deaths from cancer of the lung both locally and in England and Wales shewed an increase over the figures for 1954. The tuberculosis death rate was 0.14, an increase on the low record of 0.07 for the previous year. This, however, was better than the figure of 0.15 for England and Wales. Notifications of infectious disease amounted to 1,074 compared with the abnormally low figure of 200 for 1954. The increase was accounted for almost entirely by the measles epidemic in the first half of the year. There was no deaths from measles or from other infectious diseases. For the sixth successive year there were no cases of diphtheria in Wimbledon. Eleven cases of poliomyelitis were notified, six of them being associated with paralysis. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee my appreciation for the consideration and courtesy which they have shewn to me during the year. My thanks are also due to all members of the staff of the Health Department for the loyal and efficient way in which they have carried out their duties. I would like to thank Mr. Cockell, the Senior Sanitary Inspector and Mr. Richardson, my Chief Clerk, for their contribution in connection with the preparation of this report. I am also indebted to my colleagues in other departments for their ready help on all occasions. I have the honour to be. Your obedient Servant, HAROLD ELLIS, Medical Officer of Health. 2 LIST OF CONTENTS.

All rates used in this report are based on the Registrar-General's figures. BIRTHS. The statistics supplied by the Registrar-General show that during the year 1955, the total number of registered live births belonging to Wimbledon was 781. Of this number, 405 were males and 376 females. This gives a birth-rate of 13.45 per thousand of the population as compared with a rate of 13.48 per thousand in 1954, and an average of 13.28 in the last five years. A comparability factor has been supplied by the Registrar-General which enables the birth-rate for Wimbledon to be compared with that for England and Wales. The corrected birth-rate for Wimbledon for 1955 is 12.91 per thousand of the population, whilst the rate for England and Wales is 15.0 and has averaged 15.3 over the past five years. Stillbirths - The number of stillbirths registered during the year was 8 (6 males and 2 females), this being 10 fewer than last year. The stillbirth rate for Wimbledon was 0.14 per thousand of the population, while that for England and Wales was 0.35. Illegitimacy - Of the live births registered in 1955, 34 (20 males and 14 females) were illegitimate, this being one less than in the preceding year. One of the 8 stillbirths registered was illegitimate. DEATHS. The total number of Wimbledon residents who died during 1955 was 602 (286 males and 316 females), giving a death-rate of 10.37 per thousand of the population as compared with 10.64 per thousand for 1954. The corrected death-rate for 1955 is 8.29 per thousand as compared with a rate of 11.7 per thousand for England and Wales. The number of Wimbledon residents who died outside the Borough was 231, whilst 310 persons not normally resident in Wimbledon died in institutions, etc., in the Borough. The four principal causes of death were as follows:— Number of deaths Percentage of total deaths Disease of the heart and circulatory system 230 38% Cancer 111 18% Vascular lesions of nervous system 90 15% Diseases of the respiratory system 61 10% Totals 492 81% 8 The following is an analysis of the causes of death :— Cause Males Females Total 1.

The cause of death in this case was haemorrhage, following incomplete abortion (spontaneous) in a patient suffering from myeloid leukaemia. This maternal death was only the second which has occurred in the Borough during the past six years. 9 The following table sets out the numbers of deaths and death rates per 1,000 total live and still-births for 1955:— England and Wales Number of Deaths Rate Maternal causes, excluding abortion 369 0.54 Due to abortion 68 0.10 Total maternal mortality 437 0.64 Wimbledon Maternal causes, excluding abortion Nil Nil Due to abortion 1 1.27 Total maternal mortality 1 1.27 The estimated mid-1955 female population for England and Wales age 15-44 was 9,168,000. INFANTILE MORTALITY During 1955, there were 11 deaths in infants under one year of age, giving an infantile mortality rate for Wimbledon of 1408 per thousand live births as compared with a rate of 24.9 for England and Wales. Five of these deaths were due to congenital malformations or birth injuries and two were due to prematurity. Five of the 11 deaths occurred during the first week of life. The total number of neo-natal deaths (i.e. occurring during the first four weeks of life) was 8, giving a neo-natal death rate of 10.24 per thousand live births, as compared with a rate of 17.3 for England and Wales. There were 2 infant deaths due to accidental causes. In one of these the cause of death was asphyxia due to the inhalation of stomach contents, and was, therefore, probably preventable. The following table shews the causes of the 11 deaths which occurred during 1955, together with the age at death. 10 11 Infantile Mortality during 1955.

Consequently it is not strictly possible to compare the death-rate for Wimbledon with that for England and Wales for those years. SECTION B. — GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936, PART IV. — NURSING HOMES The Wimbledon Borough Council is responsible for the registration and supervision of nursing homes in the Borough. Eight visits of inspection were made during 1955. One existing nursing home was re-registered during the year to include premises which had been acquired as an extension. One hospital and one nursing home were exempted, on an annual basis, from registration under Section 192 of the Public Health Act, 1936. The position at the end of 1955 was as follows:— Number of homes on the register:— Maternity Nil Others 5 Number of beds provided 73 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Under Section 47 of the 1948 Act, power is given to the Councils of County Boroughs and County Districts to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for removal and detention, in a suitable hospital or other place, of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions; and (ft) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. The 1951 Act enables Local Authorities to deal more expeditiously with very urgent cases by initial removal, for a period not exceeding three weeks. It was not found necessary for the Council to make application to the Court for any such Orders during 1955. A number of border line cases were brought to the notice of the Health Department during the year. All necessary help and advice was given in each individual case, and every effort made to improve the conditions found upon inspection. LABORATORY FACILITIES. The Ministry of Health, Public Health Laboratory at Epsom is available for the bacteriological examination of samples of milk, icecream and water, swabs, sputum and other pathological specimens. In addition the staff is always available to assist the Medical Officer of Health in the investigation of any important outbreaks of disease. 14 The Laboratory at the Nelson Hospital, Merton, is also available for the examination of pathological material. The following is a summary of the examinations made during the year:— Nose and throat swabs 294 Specimens for presence of enteric and dysenteric groups of organisms 69 Miscellaneous specimens 4 Total 367 Samples of milk and water requiring chemical analysis are sent by the Corporation to the Public Analyst. MASS RADIOGRAPHY. The Mass X-Ray Unit of the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board was stationed in South Wimbledon from 7th March to 1st April, 1955. As in previous years facilities were offered to all persons over the age of 15 years for x-ray examination of the chest. I am indebted to the Medical Director of the Mass Radiography Unit for the following details of persons who attended for examination. As the facilities were available to all, and were used by persons coming from a wide area, the statistics do not necessarily relate to Wimbledon residents only. Number of persons examined: Males 2,339 Females 2,714 5,053 A bnormalities discovered: (i) Active pulmonary tuberculosis : Males 6 Females 5 11 (ii) Inactive pulmonary tuberculosis: Males 80 Females 92 172 (iii) Non-tuberculous conditions : Males 86 Females 45 131 CLEAN FOOD ADVISORY COMMITTEE. No meetings of the Clean Food Advisory Committee were held during 1955. 15 SECTION C. — SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA, Water Supply. The Metropolitan Water Board is responsible for the supply of water to the Boough and regular periodic examinations are made by that Authority. With three exceptions all the dwelling houses in Wimbledon are supplied from public water mains direct to the houses. During the year 1955 samples of water were taken for bacteriological and/or chemical examination as follows:— Bacteriological. Wimbledon Corporation Swimming Baths 39 Dwelling houses 13 Spring outlet near Caesar's Well 2 Allotments 2 Laundry 3 59 One unsatisfactory sample was obtained from the Swimming Baths. This indicated that the chlorination at the time appeared to be insufficient to ensure the sterility of the water. This was rectified and all subsequent samples proved to be satisfactory. Three unsatisfactory samples were obtained from a laundry. This water was not used for drinking purposes but was used in connection with the laundry premises. Chemical. Five samples of water were submitted to chemical analysis by the Public Analyst. All were reported on as satisfactory. Four of these samples were from two dwelling houses supplied by a shallow well. Sanitary Inspection of the District. The following is a summary of the complaints received and the visits made during the year 1955:— Complaints received.

MiLk. In accordance with the provisions of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949 to 1954, the handling, distribution and sale of milk continued to receive the necessary attention. The number of distributors of milk in the Borough, as shown by the register kept in accordance with the Regulations, is 34. The following licences were granted by the Council under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1953 and the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954: — Pasteurisers' Licences Nil Dealers' Licences— Tuberculin Tested Milk 20 Pasteurised Milk 25 Sterilised Milk 32 Supplementary Licences— Tuberculin Tested Milk 9 Pasteurised Milk 10 Sterilised Milk 8 104 During the year 241 samples of designated milk were submitted for bacteriological examination. The results were as follows:— Designation Satisfactory. Unsatisfactory.  Pasteurised 162 2 Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 29 1 Tuberculin Tested (Farm bottled) 6 2 Sterilised 44 — All the 5 unsatisfactory samples failed the methylene blue test (keeping quality). Subsequent samples from the same sources in each case proved satisfactory. Four samples of Tuberculin Tested (farm bottled) milk were sent to the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene Laboratory for animal inoculation. All these samples were found to be negative for tubercle bacilli. 23 Ice-Cream. During the year 167 samples were submitted for bacteriological examination. The results were as follows:— Grade 1 132 Grade 2 18 Grade 3 13 Grade 4 4 Grade 1 and 2 samples can be considered satisfactory; only 20% of the samples taken from any one vendor should be of grade 3 quality, and none of Grade 4. Investigations were made into the handling of the ice-cream from manufacturer to consumer in the cases of Grades 3 and 4 results mentioned above, and subsequent samples proved satisfactory. Meat and Other Foods. There are no active slaughterhouses within the Borough. Four slaughtermen's licences were issued under the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1954, during the year 1955. Food and Drugs Act, 1938. The routine inspection of food shops and other food premises has continued to form an important part of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors. A register of all such premises includes the following:— Confectioners 124 Butchers 45 Fishmongers 26 Bakers 32 Greengrocers 60 Restaurants and Cafes 82 Grocers 124 493 Work was in progress in December, 1955, in connection with the compilation of a comprehensive list of "food premises". The number of food premises registered in accordance with Section 14 is as follows:— Premises registered for the storage and sale of ice-cream 121 Premises registered for the manufacture and sale of ice-cream 3 Premises registered for the preparation or manufacture of sausages 42 Premises registered for the preparation or manufacture of potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food 25 24 Unsound Food. Following the closing down of the Corporation's refuse disposal works at the end of 1955, arrangements were made with Merton and Morden U.D.C. for the reception of unsound food surrendered to the Health Department. This system operated until December, 1955, when arrangements were made for this procedure to continue for a further period of two years. The following is a list of unsound food surrendered during the year:— cwts. qrs. lbs.

This informal sample consisted of a portion of a small white loaf which contained a number of small black particles. The sample was submitted to the Public Analyst, who expressed the opinion that the discolouration of the dough was due to the inclusion of small drops of lubrication oil or grease. As the result of an investigation it was found that the lubrication of the bakehouse machinery was defective, and the baker concerned took measures to ensure that the defects were rectified. Glycerine, honey and oil of lemon. This informal sample consisted of a bottle of medicine (glycerine, honey and oil of lemon with citric acid). The Public Analyst reported 27 that the sample contained in addition to the ingredients stated 40% of sugar syrup. In his opinion, the description of the preparation was not correct. Following correspondence with the firm concerned a new label was drafted which complied with legal requirements. Icing sugar. This formal sample consisted of icing sugar prepared with sugar, calcium phosphate, colouring and flavouring. The Public Analyst reported that the description "phosphate" on the label was not an appropriate designation for "calcium phosphate" for the purposes of the Labelling of Food Order 1953. Following correspondence the firm concerned reprinted their carton with revised wording which complied with the requirements. Milk. This formal sample consisted of two glasses of milk purchased at a local cafe. The milk was found to be deficient in milk fat, the deficiency corresponding to the abstraction of 41%. An explanation by the vendor was submitted to the Health Committee, and as a result the Town Clerk was instructed to send a warning letter. Non-brewed condiment. This formal sample consisted of non-brewed condiment obtained from a barrel. The Public Analyst reported that the sample was slightly deficient in acetic acid and was cloudy in appearance due to the presence of suspended vegetable matter and to the presence of anguillula aceti (vinegar eel). When the shop was re-visited it was found that the barrel, which had been almost empty when the sample was purchased, had been returned to the producers. Following correspondence with the producers, the barrel in question was destroyed. Stout. As the result of a complaint by a local resident, a partially filled bottle of stout was submitted to the Public Analyst as an informal sample. He expressed the opinion that the stout was contaminated with disinfectant of a tar acid type, and that the contamination was such as to render the stout objectionable in taste and odour and unfit for human consumption. Proceedings were instituted against the bottling firm, and the defendants pleaded not guilty. The Court found that no act or default of the defendants was proved and the summons was dismissed. No costs were awarded. Tomato juice cocktail. This was a formal sample which was submitted to the Public Analyst, who was of opinion that the calculation and specification of the quantity of vitamin B present did not comply with the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order 1953. The manufacturers were communicated with, but the matter had not been resolved by the end of 1955. 28 Other Legal Proceedings. Five prosecutions were taken under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Details of these cases are given below:- A producer was summoned for selling a meat pie in which was embedded a piece of metal. The defendant pleaded guilty and was fined £2. Costs awarded amounted to £2. 2s. Od. A retailer was summoned for selling a loaf of bread in which was embedded a piece of string. The defendant pleaded guilty and was fined £15. Costs awarded amounted to £1. 1s. Od. A retailer was summoned for selling a loaf of bread in which was embedded a piece of string. The defendant pleaded guilty and was fined £15. Costs awarded amounted to £1. 1s. 0d. A retailer was summoned for selling a loaf of bread in which was embedded a flour bag label. The defendant pleaded guilty and was fined £15. Costs awarded amounted to £1. 1s. Od. A retailer was summoned for selling a cream doughnut in which was embedded a nail. The defendant pleaded not guilty and after hearing evidence the charge was dismissed. No costs were awarded. 29 SECTION F. — RODENT CONTROL, PETROLEUM STORAGE, ETC.

The Public Health Department continued to undertake the routine disinfestation of schools and school canteens administered by the County Council within the Borough, as and when necessary, on a contract basis. PETROLEUM (CONSOLIDATION) ACT, 1928. 66 licences were issued by the Department to store petroleum spirit during 1955, and the total quantity of petroleum spirit stored was 91.560 gallons. In addition, 8 licences were issued to store petroleum mixtures involving a total of 284 gallons, and 4 licences were issued in respect of the storage of a total of 46½ cwts. of calcium carbide. 164 inspections were made of various premises in respect of which licences had been issued. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. 8 licences to keep pet shops were issued by the Department during 1955. 43 visits were made to these premises and various infringements of the conditions of licence were rectified. 30 HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. This Act, together with Regulations made thereunder, prohibits the sale or letting of unguarded electric fires, gas fires and oil heaters. The Regulations exempted until the 1st October, 1954, certain appliances which were manufactured before the date of the operation of the Regulations. During 1955, 31 visits were made in connection with this Act and 16 electric, gas and oil appliances were examined and the prescribed tests applied. All these appliances were found not to conform to the standards laid down and were either modified or withdrawn from sale. SHOPS ACT, 1950. As far as possible inspections have been made of the sanitary accommodation, and heating and ventilation of shops, and improvements have been effected as circumstances have permitted. Surveys are carried out regularly to observe compliance in respect of general closing hours, half day closing and Sunday trading, with individual visits as necessary in respect of conditions of employment of young persons. The total number of inspections made for the purposes of this Act during 1955 was 232. DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACTS. One case of fowl pest within the Borough was confirmed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries during 1955. In consequence of Orders made by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, particularly with regard to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, a number of enquiries were dealt with. 31 SECTION G. - PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. During the year there were 1,074 cases of infectious disease notified compared with 200 cases in 1954 and 1,267 in 1953. Of the total notifications, 813 were in respect of measles and 139 in respect of whooping cough. SMALLPOX. No case occurred in the Borough during the year, but a total of 8 persons who had been in contact with cases abroad needed to be supervised during the period of quarantine. SCARLET FEVER. There were 77 cases of scarlet fever notified during 1955 compared with 49 in 1954, 96 in 1953, and 128 in 1952. The disease for a number of years has been mild in character. ERYSIPELAS. Two cases were notified, both of which were removed to hospital. DIPHTHERIA. There were no confirmed cases. DYSENTERY. Only 2 cases were notified compared with 14 in 1954, 19 in 1953, 36 in 1952 and 53 in 1951. In the first case the patient was found to be suffering from Sonne dysentery. The second case was amoebic dysentery and from enquiries made into the patient's history it would appear that the disease was contracted while he was on military service in the Far East during the war. In 5 other cases which were investigated but not formally notified, the diagnosis was not confirmed. MEASLES. There were 813 cases notified during the year compared with 18 in 1954, 896 in 1953, 337 in 1952 and 758 in 1951. Measles is usually prevalent in alternate years and the high incidence of the disease during 1955 was not unexpected. ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS During 1955 there was an increased incidence of poliomyelitis throughout England and Wales. The total number of cases notified was 6,331, and this figure has only twice been exceeded, in 1950 when corrected notifications amounted to 7.760 and in the epidemic of 1947 when 7,776 cases were notified. There were 11 confirmed cases in the Borough in 1955, all of which were removed to hospital. Thirteen other suspected cases (12 of them hospital removals) were also investigated, but were subsequently not 32 confirmed. Of the confirmed cases 6 were of the paralytic type and 5 non-paralytic. There were no deaths. A considerable number of visits were paid to contacts by the staff of the Health Department. PNEUMONIA Twenty-one cases of acute primary or influenzal pneumonia were notified during the year, compared with 18 in 1954 and 29 in 1953. The total number of deaths from all forms of the disease during the year was 18 compared with 19 in 1954. FOOD POISONING. Four single cases were reported, one of which was admitted to hospital. Bacteriological investigations were carried out in each case but in the first 2 the causative agent was not discovered. In the other 2 cases the organism responsible was salmonella typhi-murium. WHOOPING COUGH One hundred and thirty-nine cases were notified during the year compared with 74, 183, 112 and 166 in the last four years. There were no deaths. MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION. Of three cases investigated, none was confirmed. VACCINATION. Vaccination against smallpox is no longer compulsory. The vaccination Acts, 1867 to 1907 were repealed by the National Health Service Act, 1946. During the year the following vaccinations were carried out in the district:— Primary vaccinations 337 Re-vaccinations 48 WHOOPING COUGH IMMUNISATION. The following figures show the number of children immunised and those who received reinforcing doses during the year (this includes those children who received the combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylaxis).

During the year 84 new cases were added to the register of tuberculous persons compared with 74 in 1954, and 106 in 1953. Of the 84 additions, 40 were primary notifications and 44 were transferred from other areas. An analysis of the notifications received is given overleaf. One hundred and seventy-five cases were removed from the register for the following reasons:- Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary. M. F. M. #] Deaths from tuberculosis 5 3 — — Deaths of patients suffering from tuberculosis through other causes Recovered cases 24 37 4 3 Removals from district 49 39 3 8 78 79 7 11 The figure of 8 deaths from all forms of tuberculosis represents a death rate, per 1,000 of population, of 0.14 compared with 0 07 for 1954 when the lowest figure ever, was recorded. The rate for England and Wales for 1955 was 015. The death rate for this disease has continued to fall over a number of years both locally and nationally. The detection of the disease in an early stage by the increasing use of mass radiography has been an important factor in producing this result. 37 38 TUBERCULOSIS, 1955.
