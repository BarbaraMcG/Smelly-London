BY JOHN DIXON, M.D., Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, Licentiate in Midwifery, etc. Fellow of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health. Medical Officer of Health for the Parish. London: Frederick Shaw & Co., Printers, Dockhead, S.E. 1897. ANNUAL REPORT OF Medical Officer of Health. TO THE VESTRY OF BERMONDSEY. Mr. Chairman And Gentlemen, My Twenty-first Annual Report on the state of the public health in the Parish of Bermondsey includes the registration year of 53 weeks that ended on the 2nd day of January, 1897. Compared with the previous year there were 9 fewer births, and 4 more deaths. Zymotic diseases were more prevalent, especially whooping cough and diphtheria. Fewer deaths occurred from measles and diarrhœa. The mortality from enteric fever was the same as in 1895, and the death rate from that cause (0.12) was slightly below that of London (0.14). Tubercular diseases and those of the respiratory organs were somewhat less fatal. On the other hand, cancer and heart disease caused a greater number of deaths. Smallpox was notified in 4 instances, but there were no fatal cases. The recent census showed that the population had increased 793 in the course of the last five years, and amounted to 85,475 in April, 1896. The increase must be attributed to the erection of several large blocks of Artizan's dwellings in Bermondsey New Road. The Leather Market District, in which those buildings are situated, has 1,727 more inhabitants, while the St. James' district has 934 less population. Our natural increase of population, or the excess of births over deaths, was 1,330; but we are not entitled to regard that as a real or permanent addition. The estimated population is 85,508. BIRTHS. The total number of births registered in the Parish was 3,203, being 9 less than in the previous year, and 24 more than the decennial average. In the Leather Market District there were 1,301 births, and in St. James', 1,902. The number of children born in the first quarter of the year was 783; in the second quarter, 767; in the third quarter, 783; and in the last quarter, 870. The annual birth rate per thousand of the estimated population in the Leather Market District was 40.2; in St. James' District, 35.7; and for the whole Parish, 37.5. The birth-rate in London was 30.2, being rather lower than in 1895, when the rate was 30.5. DEATHS. The deaths from all causes recorded in Bermondsey numbered 1,449, and of parishioners in out-lying Public Institutions 424, making a total of 1,873. In the previous year the total deaths were 1,869; in 1894, 1,734; and in 1893, 2,004. The deaths registered in the Leather Market District were 567, and in St. James', 897. In the first quarter of the year there were 393 deaths; in the second quarter, 368; in the third quarter, 341; and in the last quarter, 347. The annual death-rate per thousand of the population, calculated on the deaths which took place in the Parish, was 16.7; the rate for deaths of parishioners in Infirmaries, Asylums, Hospitals, etc., was 4.9, making a corrected total death-rate of 21.6. The death-rate in London was 18.6; the average deathrate in the previous ten years having been 20.1 With the exception of the rates in the years 1889 and 1894, the rate in 1896 was the lowest hitherto recorded in London. By excluding the deaths of persons ascertained to have been strangers, the death-rate of London is reduced to 18.2 per thousand. The number of deaths of children under 1 year of age in Bermondsey was 490, and in Public Institutions 23, making a total of 513. These deaths are equal to a rate of 160 per thousand registered births; the like rate in London was 161. The average rate in the 10 years immediately preceeding was 155. CAUSES OF DEATH. From the chief diseases of the zymotic class, 268 deaths were registered in the Parish, and 60 in out-lying Public Institutions, making a total of 328, against 270 in the previous year, and 279 in 1894. Of these deaths in Bermondsey, 115 took place in the Leather Market District, and 153 in St. James'. In the first quarter of the year there were 69 deaths; in the second, 94; in the third, 77; and in the fourth quarter, 28. Measles caused 75 deaths, being 39 less than in the previous year. From diphtheria there were 73 deaths, being 44 above the number in 1895. The deaths from whooping cough numbered 97, showing an excess of 74. Scarlet fever caused 20 deaths, enteric fever 11, and diarrhœa 52. The deaths from diarrhœa were 28 fewer than in 1895. The total zymotic death-rate was 3.8 per thousand of the population; that of London being 3.1. The death-rate from diphtheria in Bermondsey, in 1896 was 0.84; in 1895, 0.34; in 1894, 0.78; and in 1893, 0.94. The death rate from whooping cough in the Parish amounted to 1.13, that of London being 0.65. Influenza caused 7 deaths, against 28 in the previous year. In the class of septic diseases there were 15 deaths, including 6 from erysipelas and 6 from puerperal fever. Nine deaths were referred to alcoholism, of which 3 were from delirium tremens. Rheumatism and rheumatic fever caused 12 deaths, being a slight excess on the numbers recorded in the three previous years. From rickets there were 4 deaths of young children. The deaths of 58 persons were referred to various forms of cancer; of these 37 took place in the Parish, and 27 in hospitals. This number is 8 more than in the previous year. In the tubercular order of diseases there were 266 deaths, against 297 in the previous year. They included 17 deaths from tabes mesenterica; 58 from meningitis; 159 from phthisis; and 32 from tuberculosis; many of the latter are really deaths from phthisis. Tubercular diseases formed 14.6 per cent. of the total deaths, and equalled a deathrate of 2.99 per thousand inhabitants. In the class of developmental diseases 125 deaths were recorded: of these, 43 were due to premature birth; 4 atelectasis; 3 to congenital malformations; and 75 to old age. From diseases of the brain and nervous system there were 113 deaths in the Parish, and 33 in hospitals; making a total of 146, being nearly 8 per cent. of the total deaths. There were 45 deaths from apoplexy; 16 from paralysis; 6 from epilepsy; and 51 from convulsions. There were 5 deaths from insanity in the Asylums; five persons died from the disease of the internal ear. To diseases of the heart and organs of circulation 154 deaths were referred, being an increase on the mean of the three previous years. They formed rather more than 8 per cent, of the total deaths. From diseases of the respiratory organs there were 369 deaths in the Parish, and 41 in hospitals, making a total of 410. They formed nearly 22 per cent, of the total deaths and equalled a death-rate of 4.76 per thousand inhabitants. Croup caused 14 deaths; bronchitis, 210; pneumonia, 271 ; and other pulmonary diseases, 16. From. bronchitis and pneumonia combined there were 43 deaths less than in the previous year. Diseases of the digestive organs contributed 76 deaths to the general mortality; of these 22 were referred to diseases of the liver. From diseases of the kidney and urinary organs there were 43 deaths. Two persons died from diabetes; 1 from Addison's disease; and 2 from ovarian tumour. Ten women died from child-birth, which is an unusually high proportion. The various forms of wasting disease in infants caused 101 deaths, against 113 in the previous year, and 75 in 1894. A large proportion of these deaths are really due to mal-nutrition, arising from the improper feeding of young children. The ignorance which is frequently shown by young mothers on this important subject is very remarkable. The deaths attributed to violent causes numbered 74, being a considerable increase on the average of the three previous years. Of these, 48 occurred in Bermondsey, and 26 in hospitals. There were 67 deaths from accidents and 7 cases of suicide. The accidents included—fractures and contusions, 21; burns and scalds, 11; accidental suffocation, 28; and drowning, 7. Of the suicides, there were 4 by poison; 1 by hanging; 1 by cut-throat; and 1 by gun-shot wound. An infant, newly-born, was found dead. One hundred and eighteen inquests were held in the Parish, being 8 per cent, of the parochial deaths. Forty-five deaths were uncertified, the majority of these being newly-born children of defective vitality. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. During the year, 857 certificates were received, against 610 in the previous year. There were of cases of scarlet fever, 394; of diphtheria, 250; of erysipelas, 131; of enteric or typhoid fever, 65; of 5 puerperal fever, 5; of membranous croup, 8; and of small-pox, 4. The first quarter of the year had the lowest, and the third quarter the highest number. All the houses in these cases were inspected by the Sanitary staff, and disinfected, either by the officers of the vestry, or to the satisfaction of the Medical Attendant. Four hundred and fifty-three persons suffering from infectious disease were removed to hospitals. Five hundred and seventy-seven lots of bedding, and 8,272 articles were disinfected in the disinfecting chamber of the Vestry. Eight hundred and seventy-nine copies of notification certificates were sent to schools, and 799 notices of infectious disease to masters of houses. Six hundred and ninety-eight cases of infectious disease were reported to the Superintending Visitor of the School Board. Of the notifications of those notifiable diseases which are eligible for admission to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 52.47 per cent, were admitted to the Managers' hospitals. The percentage of such cases received from Bermondsey was 62.81, which I think shows that the Parish had its fair share of hospital accommodation. SANITARY WORK. The number of houses and other premises inspected during the year ending Lady-day, 1897, was 3,606. Notices and intimations served for the execution of Sanitary works numbered 2,431; of re-inspections of premises there were 8,601. Six hundred and fifty-seven houses were disinfected, cleansed and purified. The number of defective drains which required to be re-constructed or trapped was 283, being a much smaller number than in the previous year. The offensive accumulations removed numbered 70. The cases of overcrowding which required abatement were 82, being fewer than in the previous year. Eighteen houses were closed as being unfit for human habitation. Effective means were taken to prevent dampness in rooms in 103 instances. The number of dead bodies removed from rooms to the Parish Mortuary was 64, being an increase of 26. The inspections included 5 slaughter-houses, 6 cow-houses, 81 bakehouses, and a large number of factories and workshops. The summonses which it was found necessary to take out before police magistrates for not complying with the orders of the Vestry were 33, being 3 less than in the previous year. The intelligence and zeal shown by your Sanitary Inspectors in enforcing the abatement of all nuisances wherever found to exist have been continued with undiminished energy. Thanking the Vestry and my colleagues for the kind assistance at all times willingly given me, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN DIXON, M.D., L.R.C.P., Lond.; M.R.C.S; L.S.A., Etc.

Notices have been served for cleansing passages, floors, wash-houses, water closets, and the remedying of other sanitary defects. The whole of these houses have a good supply of water direct from the main without the intervention of a cistern. The yards are well paved. During the year the following registered houses have been pulled down:— 8, 21, 23, 30, Camperdown Place. 1, 3, Ship and Mermaid Row. The total number of houses now on the Register is 307. During the year the Sanitary and Public Health Committee held 25 meetings, besides making visits of inspection in different parts of the Parish on several occasions. In 9 premises, cooling chambers and catch-pits have been constructed for preventing hot water, steam and improper substances entering the Public Sewers. The question of Lavatory basins being provided for washing has been before the Committee, and in a number of cases, especially in those factories where articles of food are prepared, suitable washing conveniences have been supplied for the use of the workpeople engaged in them. Reports have been received of upwards of 2,000 cases where chimneys and shafts have been kept under observation. Eleven statutory notices have been served for the abatement of the smoke nuisance; seven summonses were taken out and fines and costs inflicted, amounting to £23 14s. 0d. There are 81 Bakehouses in the Parish, 14 of which are at the present time unused. The whole of these have been inspected, and where necessary notices have been served for cleansing, etc. The Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses have from time to time been inspected. After certain require- merits were complied with at one of the cow-houses no objections were offered to the renewal of any of the licences. Efforts have been made to secure suitable premises which could be used as a temporary shelter for persons who are compelled to leave their dwellings during the process of disinfection. The need for such a shelter being provided in accordance with the 60th section of the Public Health Act is pressed upon our notice by the fact that no less than 54 families have been obliged to vacate their homes while their rooms were being disinfected, and although care has been taken in all cases to minimise as far as possible the inconvenience to the persons, yet it is evident that there has been considerable hardship in many instances. Under the Housing of the Working Classes' Act, 15, Salisbury Street was reported as being unfit for human habitation, and a closing order obtained, the owner being fined ,£10 and costs, and the magistrate directing that the three tenants should each receive 10s. as compensation. The owners of 1,2, 3, 4, King's Head Court, and 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, Swan Mead, were served. with notices to carry out various sanitary works so as to put them in a habitable condition, but they decided to close them in preference to carrying out notices. The houses have since been demolished. Eighty-two cases of overcrowding were reported and very carefully investigated by the Committee. In a few instances it became necessary to institute legal proceedings in order to enforce the orders of the Vestry. It is much to be regretted that the efforts to secure public lavatory accommodation for both sexes in Southwark Park Road, opposite " John Bull" P.H. and "Queen Charlotte" P.H., at junction of Jamaica Road and Southwark Park Road have hitherto been unsuccessful. With regard to the Staff of the Sanitary Department, Mr. Cockburn resigned his position, and the Vestry, on November 2nd, appointed Mr. Owner and Mr. Stiles as Assistant Inspectors, while Mr. Bartlett, who had already been in the service of the Vestry for several years, was appointed as an Assistant Inspector in December, he having at that time passed the examination and obtained a certificate of the Sanitary Institute. The parish was divided into three nearly equal districts, each of the above named having one of the districts under his charge, the whole under my supervision. The rearrangement of the department is working satisfactorily, and each of the officials has shown himself to be thoroughly capable, zealous and painstaking. HENRY THOMAS, Assoc. San. Inst., Chief Sanitary Inspector. FORTNIGHTLY REPORTS OF Medical Officer of Health 13th January, 1896.

Nine cases of scarlet fever were reported. One case of smallpox occurred at 41, Alexis Street, of which notice has been received from the hospital. I have inspected the machine rooms and bakehouses of Messrs. Peek, Frean & Co., which are in a perfectly clean and satisfactory condition. 10th February, 1896. During the week that ended on the 1st day of February 64 births and 30 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth rate of 39· 3 and an annual rate of mortality of 18·4 per thousand of the estimated population. If the 5 deaths in outlying institutions are included, the death rate is raised to 21·5. The death rate in London was 17·8.

The notification of infectious diseases were 16 in number, including scarlet fever 10, diphtheria 3, erysipelas 2, and typhoid fever 1. In the week ending February 8th, 67 births and 32 deaths were registered in the parish. These figures correspond to an annual birth rate of 41·1 and an annual death rate of 19·6 per thousand inhabitants.

Sixteen cases of infectious disease were notified, viz.: of scarlet fever 10, diphtheria 3, erysipelas 2, and typhoid fever 1. Five cases of anthrax have occurred at Neckinger Mills. All the men were removed to Guy's Hospital and are doing well. The source of infection is difficult to ascertain with certainty. It was probably due to foreign goat skins of Sardinian origin, received through Sun & Topping's Wharf. There is a labourer at that wharf, now in Guy's Hospital, suffering from the same disease. I have received a memorandum from H.M. Chief Inspector of Factories, intimating that for the various Acts to have the beneficial effect desired, it is absolutely necessary that there should be thorough co-operation between the sanitary authorities and H.M. Inspectors of Factories, and with that object in view he has requested H.M. Inspectors to have a conference with each Medical Officer in their respective districts.

It is proposed to enlarge it by raising the ceiling and lowering the floor, which will then provide the necessary cubic space. The room at 41, Clement's Road does not require stripping or whitewashing. The room at 47, Beatrice Road has been repapered and whitewashed. The work I believe was necessary on account of the condition of the room, but was not otherwise required in consequence of a case of illness which occurred last November.

It was reported that the cistern at that house was in an inaccessible part of the roof and had not been cleansed during two years.

I have visited the premises which had been disinfected under Section 60 of the Public Health Act, 1891, in accordance with my instructions, and found that they had been visited by the Sanitary Inspector, fumigated by an employé of the Vestry, and that the certificate of the Sanitary Inspector to that effect was perfectly correct. I am of opinion that the interpretation which the Committee have placed on Section 60 of the Public Health Act, 1891, is not a correct one, and that the duty imposed on the Medical Officer of Health is that of a third-class Sanitary Inspector, if required at all.

In the week that ended on October 24th, 74 births and 36 deaths were registered in the parish, which corresponded to an annual birth rate of 44·9, and an annual death rate of 21·8 per thousand inhabitants. The number of deaths of children under 1 year of age was 14, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 6. In the zymotic class there was 1 death from whooping cough.

Anders, at 58, Long Walk, I have not found that anything but coke is consumed under the boiler. With the existing low chimney shaft it is very probable that under certain directions of the wind, the burning of coke only may be very disagreeable to the inmates of 20, Abbey Street, and I recommend that the chimney should be raised by the addition of an iron pipe, The occupier of the adjoining business premises had not experienced any nuisance. On the 35th and 22nd instant I inspected the premises of Messrs. Bowron, in Purbrook Street. There is no smell from the manufacture of hydrogen gas, or from its consumption after being carbonized. In a shed which immediately adjoins the workhouse, the process carried on is likely, at times, to be considered very offensive by persons who are not interested in the trade. I have suggested the removal of this portion of the business to a greater distance from any inhabited dwelling, but as that could not be carried out, except at considerable expense and inconvenience, Mr. Bowron has agreed to substitute a modified process, which I trust will obviate any nuisance, November 9th, 1896. During the week that ended on the 31st day of October, 69 births and 18 deaths were registered in the parish, indicating an annual birth rate of 41·9, and an annual rate of mortality of 10·9 per thousand of the population.

Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 3 deaths, and tubercular diseases 3. Three persons died from age, and 2 from heart disease.

I visited the house No. 10, Alexis Street, and found the room in question was properly cleansed and repapered, and the ceiling whitewashed.

It is situated over a stable, and is occupied by four families, 8 adults and 7 children. The roof is defective. The walls, ceilings and passages are uniformly dirty. There is no sink, except the drain in the stable. There is one w.c., which is in the stable, and the door is kept locked to prevent the inmates making use of it as a sink. There is no Water supply in the house. The occupiers obtain water from a tap in the adjoining yard. They also use a closet in the same yard. From the insanitary condition of the house and the absence of sanitary accommodation I consider it is unfit for human habitation. I have inspected the house No. 29, Camperdown. The back part of the house is very damp from the long continued absence of a rain water gutter, which has just been fixed. I am informed that these houses will be pulled down in March next. 21st December, 1896. During the week that ended on the 12th day of December, 50 births and 22 deaths were registered in the parish.

The stench complained of at the premises of Warren Bros., 39, Tanner Street, was due to the unloading of material in an offensive condition. On this being placed in lime, the nuisance was abated. There are now 10 casks of raw material on the premises. At present they are not offensive, but it is quite likely that they may be so when they are emptied.
