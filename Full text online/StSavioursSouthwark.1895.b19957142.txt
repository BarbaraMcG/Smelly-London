The St. Saviour's District comprises the Parishes of St. Saviour and Christchurch, in the County of Surrey, and forms part of the Administrative County of London. The area of the District is 203 statute acres, viz.: St. Saviour 126 Christchurch 77 Total 203 acres. The population of the District at each of the four decennial periods of the census since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, in the year 1855, and at the quinquennial period of last census (29th March, 1896) was, according to the Census Returns as under:— POPULATION (a). 1861. 1871. 1881. 1891. 1896. St. Saviour 19,101 15,677 14,999 13,913 12,301 Christchurch 17,069 14,573 13,663 13,264 13,064 Totals 36,170 30,250 28,662 27,177 25,865 (a). This decrease of population is attributed in the Census Returns to the demolition of houses for the construction of railways, the formation of new streets, and the erection of business premises; the diminution in the number of inhabited houses is due to the same causes, and to the erection of blocks of artizans' dwellings in lieu of the smaller description of houses, each block being counted as one house. 9 The number of Inhabited Houses is also shown in the Census Returns as under:— INHABITED HOUSES. 1861. 1871. 1881. 1891.

SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT. CLERKS REPORT. MEETINGS. During the year ended 25th March, 1896, 26 Meetings of the Board. of the Paving and General Purposes Committee, 80 of the Sanitary and Sewers, 13 of the Finance, and 15 of Special Committees have been held—a total of 110 meetings of the Board and Committees.

At the same Meeting, on the motion of Mr. Frederick Baxter, J.P., seconded by Mr. N. W. Oviatt, Mr. Henry J. Coles was unanimously elected the Chairman of the Board for the year ensuing. At the previous meeting—that held on the 22nd May— on the motion of Mr. H. J. Coles, seconded by Mr. Henry Wood, the following resolution was unanimously passed:— " At the close of the second year during which Frederick Baxter, Esq., J.P., has presided as Chairman of this Board, its members desire to express their sincere appreciation, not only of the high level at which the general course of business has been maintained, but also of the felicitous manner in which on occasions of difficulty he has guided their counsels to a satisfactory and harmonious conclusion. They also desire to tender him their cordial thanks for the courteous consideration he has extended to all." CHAIRMANSHIP OF COMMITTEES. In consequence of having been elected the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Coles expressed a wish to retire from the Chairmanship of the Paving and General Purposes Committee, and Mr. Henry Wood was elected in his stead. Mr. G. J. Newton was re-elected Chairman of the Sanitary and Sewers Committee, and Mr. Henry J. Fry that of the Finance Committee for the year ensuing. REDUCTION IN POPULATION. Allusion was made in the last Annual Report to the estimate by the Registrar General of the population of the St. Saviour's District, made by him in pursuance of the provisions of the London (Equalisation of Rates) Act, 1894, from which it appeared that the population which in 1891 stood at 27,177, had, in April, 1894, been reduced to 24,609 persons a reduction equal to 9.45 per cent. The returns of 13 the quinquennial census, taken on the 29th March last, which have lately been published, show that the reduction in the population, although very considerable, was not so great as had been anticipated, being as under :— St. Saviour's Parish 12,301 Christchurch „ 13,064 Total 25,365 equal to 5.90 for St. Saviour's and 0.73 for Christchurch, or 6.63 for the whole of the district. The amount of grant receivable by the Parishes out of the common or so-called equalisation fund being proportioned to the population, it is important that the district should be credited with the full number of inhabitants to which it is entitled, and it is satisfactory to find that the diminution in uumber is not so great as the Registrar General had estimated it to be. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES. A statement of the receipts and expenditure in respect of the Public Conveniences at the east end of Southwark Street, to the 25th day of March last, being the first completed year since their reconstruction underground in 1894, has been prepared and will be found at pages 78. A profit of £60 9s. 6d. is shown in respect of the year's working, after providing for all expenses, including interest on the loan of £2,000 raised towards defraying the expenses of the reconstruction of same. The new underground conveniences at the west end of Southwark Street are nearly completed and will shortly be opened. A loan of £1,760 has been obtained of the London County Council towards the cost of construction thereof, at the rate of 3 per cent., repayable by equal instalments of principal and interest in 30 years. A description of these conveniences will be found in the Surveyor s report at page 42. BURROW'S MEWS. As mentioned in the last Annual Report, notices under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act were served upon the owners and occupiers of the premises in or abutting upon Burrow's Mews requiring them to contribute, pro rata, the cost, estimated at £455 13s. 6d., of paving, with 4" x 4" granite cubes, the carriageway of the same. The notices having been complied with and the necessary amount 14 raised the work has been carried out at a cost of £428 7s. 1d.; the balance in excess being returned to the several contributors. A small portion of the roadway was, at the request of the Guardians of the St. Saviour's Union, paved with wood, the Board of Guardians paying the extra cost incurred in so doing. POND YARD, In consequence of opposition on the patt ot owners of premises in the vicinity of Pond Yard to Mr. Fortescue's proposal for closing a portion of that thoroughfare, mentioned in the last Annual Report, the same was not further entertained Latterly, however, a fresh proposal has been made by Mr. For tescue to the effect that he should be allowed to close the northern. portion and construct, in lieu thereof, a way, 14 feet wide, from Skin Market Place to Emerson Street, through the house No. 27 in that street. To this proposal the Board has assented, subject to the following conditions, namely, that the new way or street to be formed, be not less than 20 feet wide; that all necessary permissions from the owners of and other persons interested in the adjoining properties be obtained by Mr Fortescue, and that he bear all costs and charges relating thereto as well as of the necessary application to the Court of Quarter Sessions and other legal proceedings, and hold the Boar, i harmless against all actions, suits and other proceedings in rcspect of the closing of the thoroughfare. NELSON SQUARE. It had been the intention of the Board, as announced in the last Annual Report, to serve notices, as in the case of Burrow's Mews, upon the owners and occupiers of the houses in Nelson Square requiring them to pave the carriageway and footways of the same with asphalte, and an estimate of the cost of so doing, and of the necessary drainage work, was prepared by the Surveyor of the Board, from which it appeared that the total expenditure for the same would be about £3,272, necessitating a contribution of about £47 per house on the average. The Board had not contemplated so heavy an outlay, and having regard to the fact that in many cases the owners of the houses had but a short term unexpired of their several leases, felt reluctant to impose so great a burden upon them. It therefore caused a communication to be addressed to each of them, enquiring their views in relation thereto and as to the materials that should be employed if the work were carried out. Replies were received from a majority of the owners and occupiers, some objecting to the work altogether, others, in by far the larger proportion, expressing a hope that if they were 15 called upon to contribute, the cheapest materials would be used the footways repaired merely, and the work carried out in the most economical manner possible. After further consideration the Board abandoned its intention and passed a resolution to the effect that no further steps be taken to pave Nelson Square until the freeholders consent to dedicate it to the public as a public highway. SCHOOL BOARD EXPENDITURE. A copy of a letter addressed to the School Board for London in August, 1895, protesting against the enormous and constantly increasing demands of that body and urging it to exercise greater economy, was contained in the last Annual Report. Copies of such letter were sent to the School Board for London, the Committee of Council on Education, Mr. Causton, the Member of Parliament for Southwark, and the other Boards of Works and Vestries of the Metropolis, and elicited replies from many of the authorities named, expressing concurrence with the views of this Board in the matter—one only of the twenty who replied to the circular dissenting. The answer of the School Board—deferred until March, 1896-was laconic in the extreme, and merely alleged that the decision upon the matters referred to lay within the competence of the ratepayers. Meanwhile the rate has gone on increasing by leaps and bounds; the precept of the School Board for the half-year to 25th March, 1897, demanding of this Board no less a sum than £9,515 7s. l1d., being £1,136 17s. 4d. in excess of that for the previous half-year, the total amount for the year being £17,893 18s. 6d. It would seem that appeal to the School Board is useless, and that the only effectual means of putting a stop to the increase would be a statutory limitation to the rate. In October, 1895, this Board, at the request of the Vestry of Paddington, appointed delegates, viz., Mr. F. Baxter, J.P., Mr. Henry J. Coles and Mr. H. J. Fry, to attend a proposed conference of rating and administrative authorities on the subject, and about the same time, the Vestry of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington, made a similar proposal. Ultimately the former Vestry abandoned its intention in favour of Kensington, this Board authorising its delegates to attend the conference there. Such conference took place at the Town Hall, Kensington, on the 28th November, 1895, and the following resolutions were passed :— 1. (a) "That this Conference of Delegates, representing twenty-four of the Rating Authorities of the Metropolis, as defined by the Elementary Education Act, 1870, whilst recognising the valuable work performed by the School 16 Board for London and the benefits it confers upon the community, is, nevertheless, of opinion that the expenditure of the Board has been unduly excessive, and has become a very heavy and oppressive burden upon the ratepayers, and that action is urgently called for with a view to the curtailment of such expenditure. (b) "That, in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable that a limit should be fixed by Statute to the School Board Rate. (c) "That, in the opinion of this Conference, the time has arrived when an Inquiry should be instituted, either by a Royal Commission or a Select Committee of one of the Houses of the Legislature, into the expenditure of the School Board for London, and also into the present incidence of the rate levied to meet the expenses incurred in the administration of the Elementary Education Act in the Metropolis. 2. (a) "That, in the opinion of this Conference, the present School Board Divisions are inconvenient, and the Parliamentary Boroughs as set out in the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885, should be substituted therefor. (b) "That the Register to be employed for School Board purposes should be the Register of Parochial Electors as defined by the Local Government Act, 1894. 3. "That a copy of the resolutions passed by this Conference be communicated to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President and VicePresident of the Committee of Council on Education, the School Board for London, and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, and that the Prime Minister be asked to receive a Deputation from this Conference to support the representations contained in the said resolutions." In conformity with the last mentioned resolution and the request of the Vestry, the Board appointed a representative to join the proposed deputation—namely, Mr. F. Baxter—but it did not take place; the Prime Minister preferring that the communications of the Conference should be made in writing. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. In accordance with notice given by them, the County of London and Lrush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, 17 Limited, applied to the Board for its consent to an application to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order enabling the Company to supply electricity within the St. Saviour's District and deposited plans showing that it was their intention to lay mains in the Borough High Street. The Board was strongly opposed to the application, two Companies being already authorised to supply electricity, and having statutory powers to break up the roads and footpaths in the district. It transpired, however, that the principal object which the Company had in view was to connect the two districts of St. Olave and St. George-the-Martyr, in respect of both of which they had already obtained Provisional Orders ; and, on their agreeing to omit the Borough High Street from and to limit the area of supply to a email portion of the Parish of St. Saviour lying to the east of Bowling Green Lane, in Newcomen Street, the Board gave its consent, and a Provisional Order has been issued accordingly. SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY WIDENING. In November last plans were deposited by the South Eastern Railway Company, together with the usual gazette notice and book of reference, of proposed widenings of their line of railway between Southwark Street and the Waterloo Railway Station, and in the month of December they lodged a copy of a bill for giving effect thereto in the Private Bill Office of the House of Commons. On examination of the same, it was found that the only question of importance in regard thereto, so far as this district was concerned, was the lighting of the arches, several of which will be rendered dark if the widenings are carried out. It was thought necessary, nevertheless, to present a petition against the bill in order to obtain a locus standi, and enable the Board to oppose the same, if necessary. Negotiations were, however, opened with the Company, Mr. Baxter rendering valuable assistance in so doing, with the result that the Company agreed to insert a clause for the protection of the district similar to that which was inserted in their Act of 1890, viz.:— Clause 14.—"The following provisions for the protection of the Board of Works for the St. Saviour's District (in this Section called the St. Saviour's Board) shall have effect with respect to such part of the widenings and works as are to be constructed and made, and such of the powers of the Company as are to be exercised within the said District (that is to say):— 1. The Company shall not commence the construction of any of the before-mentioned widenings, nor shall they break up or disturb any road, street or place under the control or jurisdiction of the St. Saviour's Board until they shall have given 21 days' notice in writing of their intention to commence the same, specifying 2 18 the nature of the work to be done and the street intended to be broken up and disturbed, to the Sutveyor of the St. Saviour's Board and left for him at his office, plans, sections and other necessary particulars of the construction of such widenings. 2. The Company shall repay to the St. Saviour's Board the cost of any extra lamps, including the expense of lighting and maintaining the same, which may, in the opinion of the St. Saviour's Board, be reasonably necessary for lighting any road or street crossed by such widenings after the completion thereof, and the Company shall save harmless the St. Saviour's Board against all and every expense to be occasioned thereby, and such work shall be done to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surveyor of the St. Saviour's Board at the cost, charges and expenses in all respects of the Company. 3. If any dispute or difference of opinion shall arise between the Company and the St. Saviour's Board touching the reasonableness of any of the requirements of any Surveyor acting for the St. Saviour's Board, such dispute or difference of opinion shall be referred to the arbitration of an engineer to be appointed by the Board of Trade, in manner provided by the Railway Companies' Arbitration Act, 1859." CITY AND SOUTH LONDON RAILWAY EXTENSIONS. Notice was also received in December last from the City and South London Railway Company (underground) of their intention to apply to Parliament for an extension of the time limited by their Act of 1893, and which expires on the 24th August, 1896, and a bill for giving effect thereto was deposited in due course. On careful examination of such bill, however, it was found that it not only provided for an extension of the time for the compulsory purchase of lands, viz., until the 24th August, 1898, and for the construction of the additional lines of railway until the 24th August, 1901, but that it virtually repealed Section 17 of the said Act of 1893, and authorised the Company to make and maintain during the progress of the works shafts or openings from the surface of any land or street in the Parish of St. Saviour, without limit as to the number of shafts or to the amount of obstruction which might be occasioned thereby. It was therefore resolved to present a petition against the bill. Subsequently it was ascertained that the Company could not construct the railway without having one shaft in the vicinity of the Borough High Street, and, after a considerable amount of negotiation, the following clause was agreed to and now forms part of the bill:— Clause 13.-"With reference to so much of the works by this Act authorised as will be made in or under the District of the Board of Works for the Saint Saviour's District (in this Section called 'the District'), and for the protection of the Board of Works for the Saint Saviour's 19 District (in this Section called 'the District Board'), the following provisions shall apply and have effect:— 1. There shall bo but one temporary shaft or opening in the Parish of Saint Saviour,and such shaft or opening shall be constructed and placed at the southern end of the premises of the London and County Banking Corporation in the Borough High Street and shall not bo of greater length than 100 feet (such measurement to include the hoarding or other erection enclosing the same), and shall be so constructed as not to hinder or obstruct the traffic of the Borough High Street or of any other roads, Streets or places more than may be absolutely necessary; and the Company shall (unless the Company and the District Board shall otherwise agree) at all times keep open and uninterrupted for public traffic an aggregate clear width of 32 feet of roadway and 18 feet of footway, and shall, at their own expense, shore up and erect proper hoardings, so as to prevent such shaft or opening from causing any danger to the traffic of the Borough High Street or other streets and places in the vicinity thereof. ° 2. The shaft or opening proposed to be constructed in the Borough High Street as aforesaid shall not bo used or retained for a longer period than fifteen months from the date of the commencement of the work of constructing the shaft or opening; and at the end of that period shall be filled up and discontinued by the Company. If the Company commit a breach of any provision of this Sub-section, they shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £10 for every day or part of a day during which such breach shall continue. 3. The Company shall bo responsible for all damage or injury done by them in tho construction, maintenance and user of the said intended shaft or opening; and in the event of interference by them with any pipes, sewers, drains, penstocks, gulleys, or other things in connection therewith belonging to the District Board, it shall be lawful for the Surveyor of the District Board, with workmen and others, to enter and restore, either temporarily or permanently, the said drainage works, and to charge the Company with tho expense of so doing as hereinafter provided. 1. On the expiration of the said period for which the said shaft or opening is authorised to be used, the Company shall fill in the said shaft or opening in a proper and efficient manner, ramming hard the ground in so doing, and shall complete the same and restore tho surface of the street to tho satisfaction of the Surveyor of tho District Board, and shall keep the same in repair to the like satisfaction for tho space of twelve months from the date of such restoration. 5. Immediately on tho expiration of the said period of fifteen months, the Company shall take down and remove all fences, hoardings, plant, utensils, implements and things erected or placed on or in the vicinity of the said works; and, in default of their so it shall be lawful for the said Surveyor to remove the same at tne cost of tho Company. 6. The Company shall repay to the District Board all costs, inciured by them in so doing, and in restoring, whether temporarilly permanently, the said drainage works as aforesaid and in repaving 20 and restoring in a proper and efficient manner the roadway and all pavements,channels, curbs, gulleys and other things disturbed or injured by t,he Company in the carrying out of the said works; and all expenses incurred by the District Hoard in so doing sha»l be a debt due from the Company to the District Board, and may be recovered by them, with full costs of 6uit, in any Court of competent jurisdiction. 7. Any difference which may arise under the provisions of this Section between the District Board and the Company shall be from time to time referred to and determined by an engineer to be agreed upon between the District Board and the Company; or, failing such agreement, by an engineer to be appointed, on the application of either party, by the President for the time being of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and the cost attending the determination shall be borne as he shall direct." MARGARINE ACT. It having been decided in the case of The Queen v. Titterton, tried in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, on the 7th May, 1895, before the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Charles, that the Receiver for the Metropolitan Police District is not entitled to the penalties under the Margarine Act, 1887, but that the same are payable to the prosecuting authority as in the case of fines under the Sale of Pood and Drugs Acts, application was made to the Southwark Police Court for the return of tho penalties recovered since the passing of the Margarine Act by the Board's Sanitary Inspectors, and sums, amounting to £21 10s. 0d., have been recovered and paid over to the credit of the Board. EMPLOYES' HOLIDAYS. On the motion of Mr. N. W. Oviatt, the Board has taken into consideration the question of granting to the workmen in its employ a week's holiday in the course of each year; and, after making inquiry as to the practice of the other Boards and Vestries, has resolved that all men who have been in its service for twelve months, dating from the 1st of May in any year, and have not been absent except by permission of the Surveyor, or from illness or other unavoidable cause, shall be allowed a holiday accordingly, together with their ordinary rate of pay. SALVATION ARMY SHELTERS. On the receipt, in August last, of a circular-letter from the Wandsworth and Clapham Union, forwarding copy of a resolution passed by them attributing the spread of small-pox to Salvation Army Shelters, and expressing an opinion that the provisions of the Common Lodging Houses Acts should be 21 extended to places of the kind, the Board passed a resolution concurring with the views on the subject of the body referred to. CAB STAND. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, in November last, notwithstanding objections offered thereto on the part of the Board, issued an Order for a Standing for two Hackney Carriages in Borough High Street—one at either end of the rest—opposite the premises of the London & Westminster Bank in that thoroughfare. WATER SUPPLY. The Board, in January, 1896, caused a letter to be addressed to the Local Government Board in support of a resolution passed by the Vestry of St. George-the-Martyr, urging the necessity for legislation to prevent the Water Companies increasing their charges for water which are based on annual value in proportion to the valuation lists then recently deposited without having to supply any additional water. METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD. The Board, in the same month, on the invitation of the Vestry of St. Marylebonc, appointed as delegates on its behalf, Mr. G. J. Newton and the Rev. W. Jellie, B.A., to attend a conference to consider the insufficiency of the accommodation provided for the infectious sick. The conference took place on the 3rd December, at the Court House, Marylebone Lane, and the following resolutions were passed:— 1. "That a communication be addressed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, strongly urging that Board to take steps to immediately open the vacant beds of the Gore Farm Hospital, at Darenth, for the purpose of providing the temporary accommodation required by the London Local Authorities for the cases of scarlet fever urgently requiring removal from the crowded families and houses in which they are spreading the disease. 2. "That, in the opinion of this Conference, the Authorities making a rate to raise the funds for the requirements of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be entitled to be directly and adequately represented upon that Board. 3. "That the President of the Local Government Board be asked to receive a deputation in support of the foregoing resolutions. 22 4. "That a copy of the foregoing resolutions he forwarded to the Local Government Board, the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the several Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis who have appointed delegates to attend this Conference, and that each of those Vestries and District Boards he asked to appoint one representative to attend the proposed deputation to the President of the Local Government Board." In accordance with the fourth of such resolutions, the Board appointed a representative to attend the proposed deputation to the Local Government Board, viz.: Mr. Ernest Collard. The Presidents however, declined to receive the proposed deputation. Later, the Board expressed its concurrence with a resolution passed by the Vestry of St. Pancras as follows :— "That the Local Government Board he asked to hold an Inquiry and take evidence as to the present administration of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, such Inquiry also to include its constitution; the mode of election and scope of duties; its largely increasing yearly expenditure; and its failure to provide for the requirements of the local Sanitary Authorities." The Asylums Board have now in course of erection three additional hospitals, one of which—that at Shooter's Hill— providing accommodation for 500 fever and diphtheria patients, will shortly be opened, and, it is hoped, greatly relieve the necessities in the matter of accommodation which are now so severely felt. STREET NOMENCLATURE. In accordance with an Order of the London County Council, dated 5th May, 1896, the Board has made the following alterations in the names of streets and places within the St. Saviour's District, and has issued notices for the renumbering of the houses in part of Price's Street, viz.:— Silver Street, Loman Street, to be renamed Argent Street. William's Place, Union Street „ Damon Place. Robert Street, Edward Street ,, Chancel Street. The latter name to include Price's Street up to Burrell Street. It was proposed by the London County Council to alter the name of the Grove, but the Board objected to any alteration, the name being an historical one, dating back or a century at the least, and being well known throughout London. It was felt that an important means of identifica. 23 tion would be lost if the name was altered in any way or discontinued. The views of the Board in regard thereto were represented to the Council, and it appears to have abandoned tho proposal. STAMFORD STREET. In accordance with a resolution passed by the Vestry of Christclmrch on the 26th November, calling attention to the congested state of the traffic at the Blackfriars Road end of Stamford Street, and requesting that steps might be taken for tho better regulation of the same, the Board, in February last, caused a refuge to be placed in the centre of the roadway, so as to divide the vehicular traffic and enable foot passengers to cross with greater ease and safety. It also provided a three-light gas lamp at the spot. LONDON GOVERNMENT. In .January last, the London County Council convened a Conference of Local Authorities, to consider the subject of London Local Government, and to report what powers possessed by the Council should be transferred to the Local Authorities, and invito d the Board to send delegates to the conference, the avowed object of the Council being to take steps to facilitate the carrying into etTect of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London. The Board appointed Mr. F. Baxter and Mr. William Carter together with the Clerk of the Board, its delegates accordingly. The Conference met on the 31st of January and on five subsequent occasions, and resolutions were passed expressing the views of the majority of the delegates as to the transfer of the various powers. Such resolutions, however, can have no binding force on the respective bodies whom they represented, who may or may not agree as to the advisability of giving effect thereto whenever any proposals are made for legislation in regard to the matters discussed. Moreover, the expediency or otherwise of making the transfer will greatly depend upon the nature and extent of the new governing bodies appointed to take the place of the existing \ estries and District Boards of Works. ENCROACHMENT IN EWER STREET. Mention was made in the last Annual Report of an encroachment upon the public highway in Ewer Street, Messrs. Goodwin having enclosed and appropriated to their own use a small piece of land on the west side of that street, nearly opposite the public baths, and proceedings were taken by 24 injunction in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice to restrain them from occupying the land. Just previous to the action coming on for trial, however, ft propos&l, without prejudice, was made by the defendants solicitors to give up the piece of land if the board would pay the costs of both sides. The Board refused. Subtsequently ft farther proposal was made on behalf of the defendants, without prejudice, as follows: " That the action should at once be set down for hearing, by consent, in the Short Cause List ; that the court should be asked to make an order granting an Injunction and making a declaration of the Board s title, and that each party should pay its own costs." This offer, involving, as it did, an admission that the defendants had no right or title to the land, the Board also refused, and informed them, through its solicitor, that the only terms to which it would consent would be that they should pay the whole of the costs and give up possession of the piece of land. In April last it was reported that the defendants had taken down the fence and restored the land to the use of the public, and it is understood that they have since paid the whole of the costs incurred by the Board in the matter. ICE CREAM. On receipt of a circular-letter from the Vestry of Clerkenwell, forwarding copy of a report by their Analyst on bacteriological examination of samples of water in which ice cream glasses had been washed, taken from stalls in the street, showing that such water was teeming with bacteria ; stating also that the Vestry had applied to the Local Government Board to promote legislation for the registration of the peripatetic vendors of ice creams, and to make bye-laws for the regulation of the trade, and inviting the co-operation of this Board, the Board caused a letter to be addressed to the Local Government Board in support of the proposal. AUDITORS OF ACCOUNTS. In April last, as required by law, a ballot was taken to elect Auditors to audit the Accounts of the Board for the year 1895-96, and the following were chosen :— St. Saviour. Mr. John Adams, 25, Borough High Street. Mr. Frank Rand, 79, Borough High Street. Christchurch. Mr. John Dyer Field, 197, Blackfriars Road. The Accounts were duly audited by the three gentlemen named, and a copy of their certificate is appended to the Accounts at page 72. SOLICITOR. In consequence of the large increase in the expenditure Under the head of law charges, the Board resolved to appoint a Solicitor, at a salary of £100 per annum, whose duties should be to advise the Board upon all legal matters, and conduct, free of extra charge, all cases in Police Courts or other Courts of legal jurisdiction, excepting the higher Courts. The election took place on the 4th March last, and Mr. Geoffrey C. Topham, of No. 19, Borough High Street, &as elected. W. H. ATKINS. Boaud Room, Emerson Street, Bankside, S.E. August, 1896. 25 26 SURVEYORS REPORT. For the Year ending Lady Day, 1896. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Thirteenth Annual report on the various matters connected with the Departments under my control. PAVING DEPARTMENT. The abolition of macadam roads still continues, and if the present policy is maintained, we shall shortly have no macadam roads either in St. Saviour's or Christchureh. The following are the principal carnal way and footway paving works executed during the year:— PARK STREET. The carriageway of this thoroughfare from Emerson Street to the Arch of Southwark Bridge which crosses this street, has beeft paved with re-dressed granite pitching on a new foundation of lias lime concrete 6 inches in thickness ; the footways have been repaved with new 2½ inch York and resquared stone. The area of carriageway relaid is 600 supl. yards, and of footway 1450 feet, of which 457 feet was new. LITTLE WINCHESTER STREET. The old granite paving of this street has been replaced with re-dressed stone on a new concrete foundation 6 inches in thickness, and the footway paved with new 2½ inch York stone paving. Area of carriageway paved, 437 yards supl. Area of footway paved, 386 feet supl. 27 STONEY STREET. This street has been paved with re-dressed stone. It was at first intended to pave it with new granite, bat it was found that the old pitching was deep enough to re-dress, so it was decided to effect a saving and use re-dressed stone. A new lias lime concrete foundation was formed on which the redressed stone was laid. The area paved was slightly in excess of that originally estimated for. A portion of the footway was relaid. Area of carriageway paw l. 1040 yards. Area of footway paved, 213 feet. Some portion of this work was done at night in order not to inconvenience the Market traffic more than was absolutely necessary. The saving effected by using re-dressed stone was £325. LONDON BRIDGE INCLINE. The carriageway of this important thoroughfare from the existing wood paving by St. Thomas' Street to the refuge at the summit of the incline, has been paved with new 3 inch by 9 inch Aberdeen. granite pitching, tho small portion of St. Thomas' Street was included in the estimate for the work but was not carried out as the existing stone would stand another year's wear, the new stone for this work is however at our . the ranite was supplie 1 by Messrs. Mowlem & Co., ana was very satisfactory both in quality and make. The time we occupied in paving the street was four weeks which is I believe the quickest ' the work has ever been carried out in. In order not to entirely block the traffic only half the street could be paved at one time otherwise the period occupied in. carrying out these works would have been considerably less. The area paved was 2200 supl. yards and the cost of the work £1890. include the portion of St. Thomas' Street allowed for in my estimate, the stone however has been purchased and cost £214. The estimated cost per yard including establishment expenses and other charges was about 19s. 7¾d. per yard supl., the actual cost being 17s. 3½d. per yard supl. BOWLING GREEN LANE. The portion of this thoroughfare within this Board s control has been paved with compressed Rock Val de TiaveisAsphalte on a new foundation of 6 inches of Portland cement concrete. The footways have been repaved with new nic i tooled York paving. The area of carriageway paved contains about 160 supl. yards, and the footway about 270 supl. feet. 28 SOUTHWARK BRIDGE ROAD. The carriageway of a portion of this thoroughfare on the east side from Evelina Hospital to the boundary of the adjoining parish, has been paved with new 3 inch by 5 inch by 9 inch Jarrah blocks, the area paved was 180 yards. the estimated cost was 14s. 6d. per yard supl. and the actual cost 12s. 6d. per yard supl., a saving of about £2.) being effected. UNION STREET. The carriageway of this thoroughfare from Guildford Street to Southrwark Bridge Road has been paved with 3 inch by 5 inch by 9 inch creosoted deal blocks on a concrete foundation, the area paved measures 403 supl. yards. A saving of £35 was effected in this work by using blocks 5 inches deep instead of 6 inches, the difference in price being considerable and the wear of the smaller blocks will equal that of the 6 inch. THE GROVE. The surface of this street throughout its whole length from Guildford Street to Messrs. Kinneli's premises has been relaid with re-dressed granite pitching on a foundation of lias lime concrete. EWER STREET. The new paving works arranged to be carried out in this street have not been yet commenced, as we are endeavouring to come to some arrangement with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, with a view to altering the width and improving the frontage line. EDWARD STREET. The carriageway and footway from Bear Lane to Robert Street have been repaved. A portion of the carriageway comprising about 150 supl. yards, was laid with 1½ inch compressed rock asphalte on a 6 inch concrete foundation, the remaining portion of this section of the street was paved with re-dressed granite pitching on a 6 inch lias lime concrete foundation, this was necessitated by the steep incline under the railway arch. The portion of the carriageway from Robert Street to Blackfriars Road was paved with 1½ inch compressed rock asphalte and the footways repaved where necessary. The total area paved with asphalte in the whole length of this 29 street was 667 supl. yards, and that portion paved with pitching about 197 yards supl. The area of new footway paved with 2½ inch york stone was 577 feet supl., and 407 feet lineal of new and re-dressed curb was fixed. GAMBIA STREET. Thi3 street has been entirely repaved; the carriageway with 1½ inch compressed asphalte on 6 inches Portland cement concrete and the footways relaid and repaired with a portion of new 2½ inch York stone in the worst parts. The area of the carriageway paved was 787 yards supl., and the footway paving relaid comprised 3500 feet supl., of which 724 feet was new stone. JOHN STREET WEST. The old wood paving in this street which had become completely rotten in consequence of the small amount of traffic which ran over same, has been replaced with 1½ inch compressed rock asphalte on a foundation of 6 inches Portland cement concrete, the area paved being 275 yards supl. SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES. BURROWS MEWS. This thoroughfare has been paved with 4 inch by 4 inch Enderby granite cubes on a 6 inch Portland cement concrete foundation. I prepared a plan of same and apportioned the cost of the work to the various owners of the property fronting on to the Mews. The work was executed under the estimated amount, and the small balance proportionately returned. The carriageway in front of the Union offices was, at the Guardians request, and by consent of the Board paved with Jarrah wood blocks and the extra cost upon the stone borne by the Guardians. SOUTHWARK BRIDGE ROAD. A portion of the carriageway on the west side of this road from the end of the Fire Brigade Station to the Welsh Chapel, had become so badly worn that I found it necessary to recommend the Committee to repave it this year. This was done, and 220 yards supl. of Jarrah wood paving laid on the existing concrete foundation at a cost of £140. 30 DISTRICT REPAIRS.

EWER STREET. A new 12 inch low level pipe sewer, 530 feet in length has been constructed in this street from Union Street to Lavington Street, together with two manholes. An even gradient of 1 in 176 was given to the pipes, which were laid on a Portland cement concrete foundation and jointed in cement. Junctions have been left in opposite each house which does away with the practice of breaking open a pipe in the sewer to insert a connection. 41 The cost of constructing this sewer has been considerably below my estimate; this was in consequence of my allowing a margin for unforseen extra works which I anticipated through the loose subsoil. BROADWALL OLD BOUNDARY SEWER. The whole of the drainage from the houses in this district which formerly drained into the above sewer has now been diverted to the low level sewer under the carriageway of Broadwall. This work has involved a considerable amount of labour and expense. Every effort has been made to induce the Lambeth Vestry to carry out the arrangements entered into with them, to co-operate with us in filling up this dangerous boundary sewer, but although that body in November 1894, passed a resolution that the work should be carried out and the Engineer to the London County Council in February 1896 expressed his opinion that we had done all we could to meet the views of the Lambeth Vestry, the matter is still in abeyance. Considering this question was first raised in the year 1892, I think it about time some action was taken on the part of the Lambeth Vestry. In consequence of the proposed abolition of the Old Boundary Sewer in the rear of the houses in Broadwall, the following connections have been made with the new low level sewer in Broadwall. These works have been carried out at the Board's expense. £ s. d.

The following private connections have been made to the public sewers:— Size of pipe—6 inch 43 " 9 " 4 " 12 " 1 48 The amount deposited for the execution of these works was £300 l1s. 8d. URINAL. A new four-stalled cast-iron Urinal with enamelled iron backs, has been fixed in Holland Street opposite Epps' Cocoa Works, this has replaced the very old defective urinal which formerly stood upon the site. The water tank for flushing works automatically and is regulated to discharge as found necessary. UNDERGROUND CONVENIENCE. An underground convenience is being constructed at the west end of Southwark Street on the site of the old large lamp column and refuge. The structure is about 52 feet long by 15 feet in width ; the inner sides of the walls are all faced with ivory white glazed bricks and coloured dado. The roof is composed of compound girders, steel joists and plates, covered with. 43 patent pavement lights excepting that portion over which the vehicular traffic passes. Silicate cotton is well rammed into the compound girders to minimise the noise caused by the traffic. The drainage is carried out on the same principle as that constructed at the lavatory at the east end of the same street, viz.:—Each connection from w.c.'s, lavatories etc., going direct into an insertion chamber. The fittings are as follows:— Urinals—Rouge royal marble divisions with enamelled iron circular backs, these are Hushed automatically from two tanks and regulated as required. W.C.'s—The water closets are of the syphonic pattern made in white china and flushed by 3 gallon cisterns. Lavatories—The lavatory basins are of white china fitted with rouge royal marble tops and brass fittings The new convenience is ventilated by a Blackman's air fan fixed under the base of the lamp column and is driven by water which is afterwards utilized for flushing the urinals. The structure will be lighted by electricity as in the other case. The position of the convenience as seen from the roadway is peculiar, this was caused by the London County Council's Subway occupying the centre of the street, thereby causing the convenience to be situated on the south side of the subway.

The quantity of water discharged from these tanks during the year is approximately 119,000 gallons, or 532 tons. We have also a brick flushing tank in st. Margaret's Court, and this is used periodically. In addition to these tanks we have our river Penstocks and Hydrants. 44 The following is a list of works executed in this District for which licences have been obtained:— Pulling down buildings 5 Alterations and repairs to ditto 24 Rebuilding Constructing crossings New buildings Licences 7 43 Amount of deposits paid to the Board for same, £105 3s. 10d. ADVERTISING STATIONS (RATING) ACT. Only one licence has been taken out during the year under the above Act. The amount deposited being £7. PUBLIC LIGHTING. There are 579 Public Lamps in the District, nine of these being meter lamps which are placed at open spaces, crossings, &c., there are also two temporary electric lamps in Blackfriars Road at the junction with Southwark Street. GEO. ROPER NORRISH, July; 1896. Surveyor. 45 MEDICAL OFFICERS REPORT. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I herewith submit to you my Annual Report for the year ending December 31st, 1895. During the year there were registered 829 births, which were distributed as follows ; In the St. Saviour sub-district there were 209 males and 222 females: in the Christchurch sub-district there were 184 males and 214 females, making a total of 393 males and 436 females in the combined districts. Taking the estimated population of the St. Saviour's district as 11,720, this would mean a birth-rate of 36.7 per 1,000, and with an estimated population of 13,103 for Christchurch, a birth-rate of 30.4 per 1,000, or a birth-rate of 33.4 per 1,000 for the whole district, whereas the birth-rate for the whole of London for the same period was 30 4 per 1,000, showing a clear gain of 3 per 1,000 in our favour. The number of deaths for the same period were as follows :— St. Saviour's District males 97 females Total 212 46 Christchurch District 110 males 127 females Total 237 In outlying institutions, St. Saviour's district has to be credited with 97 deaths and Christchurch with 136, thus bringing the total number of deaths to 682. Inquests, however, were held on the bodies of eight persons not belonging to the district, while seven deaths occurring in Christchurch workhouse also were those of people not belonging to either sub-district, bringing the corrected number of deaths down to 667. This shows an excess of births over deaths of 162. The percentage of deaths for each age period was as follows :— 25.8 of total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 15.4 „ „ „ between the ages of 1 and 5 years 3.2 " " " " " 5 " 15 " 3.6 „ „ „ „ „ 15 „ 25 „ 34.5 " " " " " 25 „ 65 „ 17 5 " " " over the age of 65 years. Compared with the death rates of the entire Metropolitan District, our infant death rate stands as follows:— The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in the whole of London, equalled 25 5 per cent. of the total deaths, and 16.5 per cent. of the registered births; while in the St. Saviour's district those infants who died under the age of one year equalled 25.8 of the total deaths, and 21 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were for London equal to 40.3 per cent. of the total deaths, and 26.2 of the registered births; and for the St. Saviour's district they were equal to 41.2 per cent. of the total deaths and 335 of registered births. The death-rate for the combined districts, counting the combined population as 24,823 is 26.87, which gives a corrected death-rate of 28.13. Appended is a list of the various causes of death. 47 I.—Zymotic Diseases. (a.) Influenza.—2 cases in St. Saviour and 6 in Christchurch proved fatal. (6.)

Gentlemen, During the year ending June 24th last, I have received 132 samples for analysis. These consisted of:— Brandy 4 samples. Bread 1„ Butter 23 „ Coffee 6 „ Gin 3 „ Lard 1 „ Milk 63 „ Mustard 10 „ Preserved Green Peas 2 „ Pepper 9 „ Vinegar 1 „ Whiskey 9 „ Total 132 The samples of Bread, Lard, Mustard, Pepper and Vinegar were all genuine and call for no remarks. Brandy.—All four samples were genuine and above the statutory strength, being respectively 10½°, 22¼°, 23° and 23½° under proof. Butter.—Twenty-one samples were genuine; two were adulterated—containing in one case 50 per cent. of margarine and in the other case consisting entirely of margarine. Coffee.—Three samples were genuine and three adulterated. The latter contained chicory to the extent of 30 per cent., 45 per cent. and 60 per cent. respectively. 58 Gin.—All three samples were genuine and above the legal strength, being respectively 26½°, 32½° and 33¾° under proof. Milk—Out of a total of sixty-three samples analysed fifty-seven were genuine. Of these— 29 were of rich quality. 17 were of average quality. 11 were of poor quality. One sample was a doubtfully genuine milk, containing four per cent. excess of water, but being fairly rich in fat. Five samples were adulterated:— 1 containing 36 per cent. added water. 1 „ 8 „ „ 1 „ 7 „ „ 1 „ 5 „ „ 1 „ 4 „ „ and also deficient in fat 25 per cent. Preserved Green Peas.—Both samples contained copper in almost identical proportion, viz., 0.8 grain and 0.79 grain per pound. In both cases convictions followed. In the first case (Grist v. Summers) the defendant appealed. After a lengthy hearing, judgment was pronounced against the appellant. In the second case the defendant pleaded guilty—after the Somerset House analysis was found to confirm my certificate—and was fined £20 and costs. These two cases will go far to stop the sale of these coppered peas. The danger of this coppering of peas and other vegetables (for haricot beans, French beans and spinach are also treated in this way to even a larger extent than in the case of peas), lies in the fact that manufacturers can, and do, introduce very varying proportions of copper. For instance, in examining samples of peas sent to me by private persons, I found two samples of the same brand to contain in one case 1.07 grain per pound and in the other 1.51 grain per pound. Thus 59 dealers in these articles are quite in the dark as to the proportion of copper present in any particular bottle or tin They would, therefore, do well to have nothing to do with these articles, at least until the proposed new Food and Drugs Act comes into force, when the question will be dealt with. Whiskey.—Eight samples were genuine and of the following strength:— 13¼ 18°, 18½°, 19°, 20°, 23¾°, 23¾° and 24° under proof. One sample was watered down to 29¾° under proof. The total number of adulterated samples is 13 (out of 132), or almost exactly 10 per cent. Of the milks, 5 out of 63 were adulterated = 7.9 per cent. I am, Gentlemen, Faithfully yours, R. BODMER. 10, Southwark Street, 10th August, 1890. 60 61 BOARD OF WORKS FOB HE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT. ABSTRACT OF ACCOUNTS, from, 5th March, 1895, to 25th March, 1890. RECEIPTS. PAYMENTS.
