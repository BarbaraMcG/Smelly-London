To the Chairman and Members of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, 1962 was comparatively uneventful as far as local public health experience was concerned. Early in the year, however, there were five separate smallpox incidents which occurred in other parts of England and Wales. These incidents each followed the arrival in this country by air of a traveller from Karachi (where there was a smallpox epidemic) and as a result there were 62 cases of smallpox and of these, 24 died. Naturally, the publicity which accompanied these smallpox incidents led to a massive demand for vaccination and revaccination, and this severely strained the resources available. This faith in vaccination is, of course, very gratifying, but vaccination ought to be carried out at leisure, and not left till an emergency arises. Again, revaccination is a very much less uncomfortable procedure than primary vaccination, and as modern conditions of life subject people in this country to the constant risk of a smallpox importation (a traveller from an infected area can be here within 24 hours) all should have a primary vaccination at the best time. This, in the opinion of the experts, is in the second year of life. Then, when the need arises, either because of international travel, or because of contact with a case, revaccination becomes comparatively simple, and full protection is secured more quickly than is the case after a primary vaccination. Very many countries will only admit persons who can show evidence of vaccination or revaccination within the previous three years, so that in these days of extensive travel, the moral is obvious. There was no case of diphtheria during 1962, and as expected, the number of cases of measles fell markedly - from 1320 to 46. Measles, of course, usually shows a biennial pattern in its incidence, so that this was not unexpected. There were only 8 cases of whooping cough notified, and only one case of poliomyelitis - that in an adult in whom the source of infection could not be traced. The low incidence of infectious disease strongly encourages the pursuit of those measures of disease prevention which have proved so valuable in the past. The existing immunisation procedures are designed to protect against smallpox, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and poliomyelitis. Efforts are continually being made to make these procedures safer and more simple. The use of oral poliomyelitis vaccine is an illustration: a quadruple vaccine is now practicable which cuts down considerably the number of injections required. All this work makes protection of infants against these infectious diseases very easy - all that is required is the co-operation of parents to ensure that the work is done. Because of the very success of the preventive programme, leading to the virtual absence of infectious disease, it becomes more and more difficult to persuade parents of the need for the immunisation of their children. These infectious diseases can only be kept at bay if the immunisation level in the community is high if this level falls, then there is a great risk that cases will once again recur, possibly with the tragic consequences experienced in years gone by. 2 Although the infant mortality rate of 20.0 shows an increase over 1961, it is still below the national figure of 21.4. The causes of the infant deaths giving rise to this figure are set out in the body of the report and it will be seen that they are all conditions which in the present state of knowledge are not capable of prediction or prevention. Further, most of these conditions are also the basic causes of still births, so that a great deal of effort must be made to try to ascertain the reason for these mishaps, in order that the required preventive measures can be applied. The remainder of the local statistics follow broadly the pattern experienced over recent years. Cancer, heart and arterial disease are the principal killers, and it is worthy of note that lung cancer has killed 8 more women (13 as against 5) than it did last year. Lung cancer has been regarded as almost completely a male prerogative, but these figures are disturbing. The Royal College of Physicians' report on Smoking and Health published during the year, made abundantly clear the causal relationship between heavy cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Much publicity is being exercised to drive this point home, particularly in the case of younger people who have not yet become addicted; a ceaseless pursuance of this theme is a principal present day need. The report of the Chief Public Health Inspector sets out in detail the statistics of the work of the department in its various aspects, and shows how wide a field is covered in public health day to day activities. Much of the work is routine - may be monotonous, may be very interesting at times - but none the less necessary. Its success is judged by the lack of incident aroused - it only becomes news when something untoward occurs, which possibly might have been prevented. The manner in which this work has been performed reflects great credit on Mr. Jenkins, the Chief Public Health Inspector, and his colleagues in the Public Health Department, and their co-operation and support has been most encouraging. The local practitioners and the medical staffs of the local hospitals also have been most co-operative, and always ready to help in the solution of any particular problem. Finally, mention must be made of the great interest shown and help given by the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee; their cooperation and support has been most valuable, and has gone a long way towards making the work a pleasure. I am, Your obedient Servant, O. C. DOBSON, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STATISTICS TOTAL AREA OF DISTRICT 6, 583 acres.

DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE The District is drained by separate soil and surface water systems. The surface water sewers are discharged into the various natural streams and watercourses, whilst the soil sewers discharge into the main sewers of the West Middlesex Sewerage System. WATER SUPPLY The water supply for the Ruislip-Northwood area is provided by the Colne Valley Water Company. All dwellings in the area are served by a piped supply and the supply during the year has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. Reports are received monthly from the Colne Valley Water Co. as to the chemical and bacteriological examination of samples of water and these have proved satisfactory. 25 The average hardness of samples of water (Parts/Million) taken during the year is:- Total hardness 264 Permanent hardness 62 Temporary hardness 202 All new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being restored to use and samples of water from them are tested bacteriologically to ensure the purity of the water. SWIMMING POOLS Ruislip Lido Thirty samples of water were obtained and submitted to the Central Health Laboratory, Colindale, for bacteriological examination. Private Swimming Pools Private swimming pools in the District were regularly inspected and samples obtained, all of which were satisfactory.

O'Keefe, Chief Officer, Public Control Department, Middlesex County Council.

C. 20 - Miscellaneous 12 1 TOTALS 227 3 The following information is given with reference to the unsatisfactory samples:- "It will be noticed that the number of samples procured in Ruislip is 50 less than in the previous year. This reduction is in the number of milk samples, because for many years past, bottled milk on retail sale has been of completely satisfactory quality and it is so controlled through production and distribution that the days of its adulteration are virtually over. Emphasis has been transferred to the sampling of raw milk in churns. Of the total of 227 samples procured in the year three only were found to be unsatisfactory. One of these was in respect of milk for consumption by scholars at a school in South Ruislip. A one-third pint bottle was found by the Public Analyst to contain mortar adhering to the base of the bottle. The sellers were sent a letter of caution after investigation had shown that it was likely that the mortar had been placed in the bottle while outside the control of the dairy, and that subsequent washing had failed to dislodge it. The second of the samples found to be unsatisfactory was a piece of cheese purchased by a resident in the district from a grocer's shop. The purchaser had selected the cheese from a display marked "New Zealand", and took it home. A small fly was later found to be embedded in the cheese. Enquiries showed that it had been purchased by the grocer from agents of the New Zealand Dairy and Marketing Board and that the fly must have been present in the cheese from the time it was manufactured in New Zealand. One of several samples of sausages procured from a retailer in the district was found to contain sulphur dioxide, which is a preservative permitted in small quantities in sausages, only if a notice is displayed in the shop, or the sausages are sold in a wrapper, declaring the presence of preservative. Subsequent samples procured did not contain preservative and no action was taken in respect of this isolated instance. Some types of natural foods, notably cuts of meat; offal from different animals; varieties of fruit (for example of apples); and varieties of fish (for example cod, haddock), can be recognised on sight as correctly described. 28 In retail shops in Ruislip-Northwood 122 labelled displays of these kinds of foods have been examined and the descriptions found to be accurate. Because the descriptions were correct samples were not procured. Whenever inspection raises a doubt samples are purchased for critical examination. During the year considerable attention has also been paid to the quality of meat and vegetables supplied to County Council establishments including schools, old folks homes and nurseries. In the whole county in the year under consideration there were 59 instances of inferior quality or wrong cuts of meat and three instances of poor quality vegetables. These have in the main been dealt with by advice to the traders rather than punitive action but one instance in which frozen beef was described as chilled, and one where cod was supplied as haddock were dealt with by prosecution of the offenders. A consignment of veal sent to a Ruislip School was found to be of poor quality. When the butcher's attention was drawn to this the meat was replaced by veal of satisfactory quality. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACTS, 1887-1953 Inspections are carried out under the Above Acts to ensure that the requirements of various Marking Orders relating to the indication of origin of imported foodstuffs are correctly observed. Inspections were made at 113 premises and a total of 362 displays of foodstuffs were examined. Generally, the requirements of the Marking Orders are well observed and there were no occasions during the year when it was necessary to institute proceedings for failure to mark. A number of minor infringements were dealt with by verbal warnings to the traders concerned. The Merchandise Marks Acts also make it an offence to apply false trade descriptions to goods. For selling to a hospital in Ruislip-Northwood butchers' meat of Uruguayan origin which was falsely described as "Argentine" a firm of butchers were prosecuted, fined £10 and ordered to pay three guineas towards the costs. THE LABELLING OF FOOD ORDER, 1953 This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller or a registered trademark; to be marked with its common or usual name and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food is composed of more than one ingredient. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed. For the purpose of ensuring a compliance with the Order 135 premises were visited and 527 articles of food were examined. A considerable volume of correspondence with importers and manufacturers, designed to secure the correction of labels which infringe the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order have been carried out during the course of the year. Types of offences dealt with in this way included foods in respect of which there was no statement of ingredients; foods upon which there was an incorrect statement of ingredients; claims to vitamins which were general and not specific, in that the presence of the vitamins was claimed without a declaration of the quantity of the vitamin present; claims that foods were "vitamin enriched" when in fact, the quantity of vitamins present was not sufficient to justify the claim that the food was a rich source; illegible labels; and insufficiently explicit names of foods. 29 SAFE MILK Four samples of raw milk were procured in Ruislip-Northwood and tested for the presence of Tubercle Bacilli. None was found to be contaminated. Twenty-two samples of milk were procured and tested to ascertain whether pasteurisation or sterilisation had been properly carried out. None of the samples failed the tests. Regular inspections of a milk pasteurising plant in Ruislip-Northwood were maide to ensure the proper handling and processing of the milk. In addition retail premises were inspected to ensure that the conditions of licence were complied with. It will be noted that there has been a reduction in the number of samples procured compared with previous years. A high rate of sampling over several years has not, so far as the processing plant sampled was concerned, disclosed a single failure of the prescribed tests. For this reason the number of samples has been reduced. LABELLING AND ADVERTISING In addition to the work detailed, much of the general work of sampling, and scrutinising of labels and advertisements, has the effect of affording protection to the residents of your district as well as the rest of Middlesex. The examples of such work which I give below are all of nationally-retailed articles of food, some manufactured in this country, others imported from abroad. Two samples of cream cheese were found on analysis to contain a less quantity of milk fat than that which has been set as a standard by some Middlesex courts. In each case letters were written to the manufacturers who agreed to raise the milk fat to conform to the standard set. Sodium fluoride tablets were found on analysis to be deficient of the quantity of the chemical claimed to be present. The manufacturer was cautioned because it was considered that the deficiency was not of such a magnitude that the efficacy of the tablets was affected. A caution was sent to the manufacturer of "Smoked ham and beef" which was found to contain 80% meat and not 95% which is expected of a meat product of this class. Two samples of imported apple juice were reported upon adversely by the Public Analyst, one because it was deficient of the claimed amount of vitamin 'C', the other because it was deficient in fruit juice. Cautions were sent to the importers in each case. ICE CREAM There are in the District one hundred and fourteen premises registered for the sale of ice cream and one for the manufacture of ice cream. Eighty-two samples were taken during the year for examination by the Methylene Blue Test. These were placed in the following grades:- Grade I 46 Grade III 12 Grade II 19 Grade IV 5 Samples of ice cream for Chemical Analysis are taken by the sampling officers of the Middlesex County Council. 30 PET SHOPS There are 4 premises licensed under the Pet Animals Act, 1951. They were visited and inspected during the year and found to be maintained in a satisfactory condition. FOOD POISONING There was no serious outbreak of food poisoning in this District during 1962. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION 3 premises were disinfected after cases of infectious disease. 1 load of clothing was disinfected 1 verminous property was disinfested 4 properties were treated for other insect infestations 2 loads of bedding and articles were destroyed 60 wasp nests were destroyed. Pools, ditches and stagnant water were treated to control the breeding of mosquitoes. MORTUARY During the year fifteen bodies were received in the public mortuary at Pinner Road Council Depot. RODENT CONTROL During the twelve months ended 31st December, 1962, the following work was carried out by the rodent staff under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949:- Visits by Rodent Officer and Operatives 2, 629 Premises Disinfested 414 Complaints received 379 Estimated kill for year 1,220 PETROLEUM ACTS During the year 66 licences were issued covering the following:- 186, 804 gallons petroleum 4,566 " " mixtures 2, 800 lbs. carbide of calcium. MEASUREMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION The Council maintain two daily volumetric filters deployed to the requirements of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and are contributing to the National Survey of Air Pollution being undertaking simultaneously by approximately one hundred selected local authorities. 31 APPENDIX A PRESCRIBED PARTICULARS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 (a) Inspections Premises No. on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted 1.
