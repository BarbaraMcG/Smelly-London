HAC 49 REPORT on the SANITARY STATE OF THE HACKNEY DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR, 1869. by JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., L.R.C.P.E., &c., Vice-President of the Meteorological Society, &c., Medical Officer of Health to the District. Printed by Order of the Board. by Andrew T. Roberts, Steam Works, 5, Hackney Road, London. 1870. to the BOARD OF WORKS for the HACKNEY DISTRICT. Gentlemen, The sanitary events of the past year have not been remarkable, so far as this district is concerned, if we except the late severe epidemic of scarlet fever, which was more fatal than in any year since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act. As the number of inhabitants increase, whenever an infectious disease breaks out, it is likely to spread more rapidly than heretofore, in consequence of the more free intercourse which almost necessarily takes place in densely populated, as compared with sparsely populated localities. There was, however, one peculiarity in this epidemic, viz.: that the children of the middle and upper-middle classes suffered proportionately more severely than those of the poorer classes. This peculiarity was not confined to Hackney only, but was observed by other medical officers of health in their districts. The number of cases attended by the medical officers of the Union was as follows:—in 1867, only 41; in 1868, 44; and in 1869, 224. This is but a small number, considering the large mortality in the district, as no less than 248 deaths from scarlet fever were registered in 1869 against 49 in 1868. The registration returns showed that a large increase in the number of deaths occurred in July, and continued up to the end of December. The sickness returns of the Union medical officers 4 did not indicate any very unusual prevalence of the disease, until the middle of August, when it rapidly reached its culminating point, and declined at the end of November, at which time a fresh outbreak occurred. This latter corresponded with the death returns which were as follows in Hackney:— For the Week ending Deaths from Scarlet Fever. For the week ending Deaths from Scarlet Fever.

Greatly, however, as this district has suffered, yet the disease has not been so fatal here as in the adjoining localities. In the whole of London the mortality was at the rate of 183 per 100,000 inhabitants; in Hackney, of 231, in Shoreditch, of 242, in Bethnal Green, of 365, in Poplar, of 326, in Whitechapel, of 253, in St. George's-in-the-East, of 314, in Stepney, of 292, in Mile End Old Town, of 250, and in Poplar, of 326. The mortality in the south districts was also very high, the rate in St. Olave's, Southwark, having been 277; in Bermondsey 5 386; in Rotherhithe, 367; and in Newington, 248. These numbers are taken from the report of the Registrar General, and show a higher death rate from scarlet fever than I calculate it to have been in this district. As might be expected from the number of new houses which have been built and inhabited during the past year, the births were in excess of those in the previous year, 3,923 having been registered in 1869 against 3,776 in 1868. The numbers for each sub-district are as follows:—257 or 6.5 per cent. in Stoke Newington; 151 or 3.8 per cent. in Stamford Hill; 934 or 23.8 per cent. in "West Hackney; 1563 or 39.9 per cent. in Hackney; and 1018 or 26.0 per cent. in South Hackney. These figures show that the births have increased in Stoke Newington, West Hackney, and Hackney, but have decreased in Stamford Hill and South Hackney. This may be accounted for by the large number of houses which are empty in South Hackney. Table I. 1869.—Births in each Sub-District. 52 Weeks. Quarters. Stoke Newingtn. Stamford Hill. West Hackney.

The number of deaths, 2639, was greater than in 1868, or indeed than in any previous year. This was caused chiefly by 6 the unusually large mortality from scarlet fever, and partly from the increase of population. To show the great disturbance in the death rate from the scarlet fever epidemic, I may mention that the deaths from cholera in the district in 1866 were only 103, and the deaths from scarlet fever last year 224. As before stated, the Registrar General calculates our rate of death from scarlet fever to have been 231 per 100,000 inhabitants, whilst I believe it to have been only 201 per 100,000 inhabitants. This difference arises from the population having been calculated at a much smaller number by him than by myself, and can only be settled after the census of 1871 has been taken.

The per-centage in the Hackney district is much larger than usual, but that was caused chiefly by the great excess of deaths in public institutions, viz., the Union Workhouse, East London Union Workhouse, and the German Hospital. These deaths invariably increase the mortality for the Hackney sub-district far above the rate it should be in proportion to the population, and I used to deduct these deaths and distribute the mortality in the Union Workhouse, pro rata 7 to the population, over the whole district, but have not done so lately in consequence of the great increase of population in the Hackney and South Hackney sub-districts, which being unknown precisely, would lead to erroneous results. The proportion of births to deaths in Hackney was below the average in 1869, as there were only 148 births to each 100 deaths, the average having been 137. This arose from the death rate having been unusually high, 230 deaths having occurred in 10,000 inhabitants. The death rate in Hackney was not so high as in London generally, that for London having been 246 per 100,000 inhabitants. The death rate in Hackney is likely to increase gradually, as the proportion of children to adults has already much increased; and also, as the population does not now consist of so large a proportion of persons in affluent circumstances. The immense increase of the poor rates, and of the number of small houses, indicate a greater number of poor residents, who die at an earlier age, and therefore at a greater rate per cent. per annum than the more wealthy classes.

The deaths of newly-born or very young infants under the heading of "premature birth," or "atrophy," were in excess of the average, 55 per 1000 having been registered against a mean of 49. Deaths from diseases of the nervous system and of the lungs were less than usual, whilst those from tubercular diseases varied but little from the mean of the ten preceding years.

This is very unusual indeed, no such coincidence having happened since my appointment; and it is not therefore surprising that 592 deaths were registered from epidemic diseases, against 320 in 1868. The mortality from fever was below an average, although larger than in 1868. In looking over the Table we must remember that the numbers are not corrected for increase of population, so that the 9 mortality of 1869 is in reality not so excessive as it would at first sight appear to he.

On examining Table 5 we find that 619, or 234 per 1000 deaths happened in infants under 1 year old; 521 deaths or 197 per 1000 between 1 and 5 years old; 189 or 72 per 1000 between 5 and 15 years; 126 or 48 per 1000 between 15 and 25; 195 or 74 per 1000 between 25 and 35; 157 or 60 per 1000 between 35 and 45; 169 or 64 per 1000 between 45 and 55; 192 or 73 per 1000 between 55 and 65; 231 or 87 per 1000 between 65 and 75; 182 or 69 per 1000 between 75 and 85; 56 or 21 per 1000 between 85 and 95; and 2 or nearly 1 per 1000 above 95 years of age. The proportion of deaths under 1 year old was not so great in 1869 as in 1868, but it was much larger between 1 and 5 years, and between 5 and 15 years of age. There were 117 deaths of persons of 80 years of age and above, of which 17 occurred at 80 and under 81; 16 at 81 and under 82; 16 at 82 and under 83; 4 only between 83 and 84; 12 between 84 and 85; 6 between 85 and 86; 10 between 86 and 87; 4 between 87 and 88; 8 between 88 and 89; 5 between 89 and 90; 9 between 90 and 91; 4 between 91 and 92; 3 between 92 and 93; and 1 above 95. 10 In the appendix a Table will be found containing the deaths from all diseases at different ages, by which we can see the frightful prevalence and fatality of scarlet fever between the ages of 1 and 15, as nearly 9 per cent. of the total mortality, or nearly one-third of all the deaths at those ages were caused by this disease. It is not likely that we shall have so large a mortality of children for a considerable time, as we may expect to be comparatively free from scarlet fever for at least three years; and as measles and whooping cough have not so marked a period for their prevalence as an epidemic, it may be many years before all these become again epidemic in one year. The sanitary works performed has been unusually large, as you will see by the appendix. The increased number of small houses in the district, to a great extent, accounts for this, as no less than 5,903 houses, containing 22,460 rooms, 8,693 families, and 34,793 inmates, were inspected during the year. Every room in the houses, and every yard with its appurtenances were examined. The particulars entered in the inspection books respecting every house are as follows : the name of the owner and occupier, the number of rooms, families, and inmates. The state of the roof and of the house generally, the condition of the yard as to paving, drainage, traps to the drains—of the dust receptacle, of the water butt or cistern, of the water closet, of the rain-water gutters and pipes, and the health of the inmates. The result of the inspection as regards nuisances was, that no less than 2,470 houses were found deficient in some of the conditions which are necessary for the preservation of health. On many of the premises the houses were dirty and dilapidated, the drainage and paving bad, and the water closets in bad order and condition. In addition to the 5,903 houses inspected under the Sauitary 11 Act, 376 houses were inspected and disinfected in consequence of epidemic diseases having appeared therein, 74 workshops, 334 premises respecting which complaints had been received, and 167 houses were measured as well as inspected. Also 81 slaughter-houses, 97 cow-sheds, 55 poulterers' and 147 greengrocers' yards were examined. The total number of premises inspected was 7,420, and of nuisances abated 4,354. The nuisances abated were as follows: 822 which were caused by defective draiDage, 2,019 arising from defects in houses, and 1,463 from various other causes. The majority of the defects in houses arose from the roofs being leaky, or the houses dirty and dilapidated. In addition to these labours, the owners and occupiers of no less than 1,146 houses were served with notices under the 35th section of the Sanitary Act for the prevention of overcrowding and keeping the houses in a good sanitary condition. This is most important, as it gives the officers of the Board the right of entry to examine the premises, without making application to a magistrate, which in law, though not in practice, they can be compelled to do under the Nuisances Removal Acts. We have served these notices on no less than 3,709 houses since the regulations have been in force in this district, so that we have very large powers in this as compared with other districts. In addition to these we have served 3,237 preliminary, and 1,755 peremptory notices. These notices have been served as a work of supererogation, as they are not required by law, but they afford owners of property time to carry out the necessary works before the statutory notices are served. The success of this plan is shown by the fact that only 515 statutory notices were taken out, and that we had to summon 85 owners of property before the magistrates, to obtain the removal of the 12 nuisances described in the 515 statutory notices. The total number of notices served was 6,727; of letters sent out, 582 ; of copies of summonses and orders, 510. Also 1,926 complaints of non-removal of dust were attended to, and 37 dead bodies were received into the mortuary. In addition to the above, which may be considered routine work, several premises were inspected under the Petroleum Act, in consequence of the petroleum having been said to be stored so as to be dangerous; also several underground rooms used as dwelling rooms, contrary to the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, were examined. The floor of one of these rooms was nine feet below the pavement, and was lighted and ventilated by a small window only four feet by two feet, and was occupied by the father, mother, and six children as a sleeping room. The number of cases of overcrowding was less this year than in 1868, but there were some very bad cases amongst them. It will be seen, by a reference to the list of streets inspected, that there were only 34,793 persons in 5,903 houses, containing 22,460 rooms, or but a little more than three persons to two rooms, and less than six persons in each house. This is a small average, and arises from the fact, that comparatively few rooms are used both for sleeping and living in, so that most families have at least two rooms. This has partly been caused by the inspections which have been regularly carried out for the prevention ef overcrowding, and by the large number of notices issued, informing owners and occupiers of houses of the number who might legally occupy the rooms. Indeed, so well is this known now. that the inspectors have much less opposition in carrying out the Act. A very large number of families now occupy two rooms, who formerly lived and slept in one. The 13 gain in health and morality has therefore been considerable. The following are particulars of some of the cases of overcrowding. In one small room in Goring street, containing cubical space for two adults and one child only, there were found living and sleeping, viz.: the father, mother, a man lodger, and four children. In another room, in Winchester place, but little larger, the father, mother, a boy of 16, another of 13, and three children under 10, lived and slept. In a small room in James place, Homerton, there were living and sleeping the father, mother, and three sons aged 21, 15, and 13 years respectively. In a room not large enough for two persons at John street, Shacklewell, there were living and sleeping, the father, mother, two children, a young man, and a young woman. In a room in the Havelock road, the father, mother, five children, and the grandmother lived and slept. At Bridge street, Homerton, the father, mother, and five children lived and slept in a room too small for two persons. In College street, Homerton, the father, mother, two girls nearly grown up, a lad of 10, and a young child lived and slept in a room large enough for two adults and a child only. There were numerous cases of overcrowding which were not of an indecent kind, and consisted of far too many members of the same family occupying a room. I need not enter into the details of these here, as it would extend the report to an unnecessary length. I would, however, remark that a few cases of overcrowding by the same families constantly recur. Amongst widows with young families, this cannot always be prevented; but I have put the law vigorously in force against heads of families who preferred drinking to providing proper accommodation for their wives and children. Several nuisances consisting of effluvia escaping from manufactories have been removed or mitigated during the year. The manufacture of varnish, at White Post lane. Hackney Wick. 14 has been stopped under the provisions of the old Building Act; the burning of tar oil, commonly called dead oil, at Messrs. Davy's, in the Hackney Marsh, has been discontinued; a manufactory for blood manure, at Hackney Wick, has been closed; a horribly offensive business at Homerton, consisting of the preparation of bladders for tying over jars, &c., has been shut up; and summonses have been taken out and orders obtained against the occupiers of two wharves, for allowing offensive matters to accumulate thereon. There has also been some additional labour thrown on the Hanitary staff by the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwelling Act, and on the 30th September, 1869, I presented the following report to the Board. I may premise that in addition to the work herein mentioned, numerous inspections were made of the premises, and notices served at the owner's residence, at Walthamstow, before the final steps described in the report. "On Friday, the 17th day of September, 1869, ten orders— each marked 'Special Order, No. 1,'—were served on me and Mr. Self, by Mr. Ellis, as Clerk to your Board, directing that the premises, numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, Lawrence buildings, Sanford lane, West Hackney, be forthwith shut up, and that the Medical Officer of Health and other officers of the said Board do take all necessary proceedings under the said Act, for carrying the orders into effect. On the same day, four orders—each marked 'Special Order, No. 2,'—were served on us, directing that Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5, The Cottages, at the rear of Lawrence buildings, Sanford lane, West Hackney, be forthwith demolished, and that the Medical Officer of Health and other officers of the Board do take the necessary proceedings for carrying the orders into effect. Immediately on receipt of the orders, I directed Mr. Self to accompany Mr. 15 High (the builder), to Lawrence buildings, to point out to him the works necessary to be done. On Saturday, the 18th, I received from Mr. High two estimates, one for demolishing the four cottages at the rear of Lawrence buildings, and carrying away the materials to the yard belonging to the Board, near the Railway Station, for the sum of £23. I submitted the estimate to the Surveyor's department, which was approved; and, therefore, directed Mr. High to commence pulling the houses down on Monday morning. Mr. Self visited the premises on the 20th, and found the work in progress, and on the 25th, when it was completed. I also directed Mr. Self to serve, on Saturday, the 18th, a seven days' notice to quit on the occupiers of Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11, Lawrence buildings, which was done, and I append a copy of the said notice to this report. I also received on the 18th an estimate from Mr. High for well and securely fastening the doors and back windows, also barricading the front windows of the abovementioned houses, for the sum of £4 10s. 0d., which I also accepted, and directed Mr. Self to demand possession of the said houses on Tuesday, the 28th September, when possession was delivered up by the occupiers of of Nos. 10 and 11, which was forthwith closed. The tenants of the other houses refused to go out. I therefore applied at the Worship Street Police Court, on Tuesday afternoon, for orders (a copy of which I append to the report), requiring the occupiers, in accordance with the Act, to permit the officers of the Board to carry out the said order of the Board, after the expiration of ten days from the service thereof. The orders were all served on the ten occupiers on Tuesday evening, the 28th, so that I propose at the expiration of the said ten days, applying to the magistrate for summonses against any of the parties who may then refuse to quit the said premises. All of which I submit for your confirmation and approval." After the expiration of the time mentioned I was 16 compelled to apply at Worship Street for summonses, and then to attend at the hearing, to produce the papers and give evidence. The magistrate ordered the occupiers to leave within a week, under the penalty provided for obstructing the officers of the Board, so that eventually we were able to close all these houses. The inspection of the cow sheds and slaughter houses was unusually laborious this year, as the Committee considered it advisable to visit every one rather early in the year, as several required considerable structural alterations, and to pay a second visit to many just before the licensing day. Seven entire days were occupied in the inspection. The magistrates refused to license three sheds which were not repaired according to our requirements. There were 37 dead bodies removed to the mortuary during the year. The causes of death were as follows: 20 from drowning; 7 newly-born infants; 4 sudden deaths; 2 from fever ; and 4 from small-pox. I cannot conclude this very brief summary of the sanitary work carried out during the year, without expressing my satisfaction with the way in which the Inspector and SubInspector have performed their duties; and also without stating my regret at the early death of Mr. Self. There is no doubt that his death, like Mr. Valentine's, was hastened by a severe cold caught in the discharge of his duties. I am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, JOHN W.
