113567 DAG 13 914.2671 CR. BOROUGH OF DAGENHAM INTERIM ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1939 CECIL HERINGTON, M.B., B.S. (Lond)., D.P.H. 3 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Dagenham. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit an Interim Report upon the Health Services of the Borough for the year 1030. This report is drawn up in accordance with the requirements of Circular 2067 of the Ministry of Health, dated 10th July, 1040, which states that, in view of the increasing pressure of work in the Public Health Department of Local Authorities, and the need for strict economy in the use of paper, the Minister considers that Interim Reports only should be made for the year, and that the subject-matter should be curtailed to certain specified items. The Minister points out, however, that suitable arrangements should be made for useful preservation of all records, including the statistics to be supplied by the Registrar-General, in order that after the termination of the war a report could be made dealing more fully with the period from the beginning of 1030 to the end of the last complete year, giving separate statistics for each year in order that the annual records may, as far as practicable, be continuous and complete. There has again been a slight decrease in the birth rate, viz.:—from 18.06 to 17.61 per 1,000 of the estimated resident population at mid-1030. The death rate has fallen from 6.0 to 5.06. The infant mortality 4 rate varies very little, it being 40.86 compared with 50.51. The maternal mortality rate has again diminished, being 2.57 per 1,000 total births against 3.5 for 1938. In presenting this report I take the opportunity once more of expressing my appreciation of the support which I have received from the Council, and of thanking the staff of the Public Health Department for their assistance and loyal co-operation. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, CECIL HERINGTON, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Civic Centre, Dagenham. 5 MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.

The Diphtheria Immunisation scheme was carried on, though, owing to the outbreak of hostilities, to a limited extent, during the latter part of the year. This treatment is, however, still given free to all persons desiring it as in former years. Tuberculosis. The following is a summary of the register:— Pulmonary. Non-Pulmonary. Male. Female. Male. Female.

For many years the East End Maternity Hospital has treated normal confinements from this area. It was decided, however, at the outbreak of hostilities, that this hospital should be evacuated ; normal labours after this have been treated in their homes or evacuated to reception areas through the scheme operated by the London County Council. Maternal Mortality. Five cases of maternal mortality were assigned to this district giving a maternal mortality rate of 2.57 compared with 2.82 for England and Wales and 3.5 for this district for the preceding year.
