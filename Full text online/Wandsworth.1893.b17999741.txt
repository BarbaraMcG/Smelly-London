Public Health (London) Act, 1891. In the Annual Report for last year reference was made to bye-laws proposed to be made under the provisions of this Act with regard to the following matters, viz.: — 1.—For securing the cleanliness and freodom from pollution of tanks, cisterns, and other receptacles used for storing of water used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man. 2.—With respect to the keeping of water closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action. 3.—For the prevention of nuisances arising from any snow, ice, salt, dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth, or other matter or thing in any street. 4.—For preventing nuisances arising from any offensive matter running out of any manufactory, brewery, slaughter-house, knacker's yard, butcher's or fishmonger's shop, or dunghill, into any uncovered place, whether or not surrounded by a wall or fence. 5.—For the prevention of the keeping of animals on any premises so as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health. 6.—As to the paving of yards and open spaces in connection with dwelling-houses. 7.—With respect to tents, vans, sheds, and similar structures used for human habitation. 8.—With respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. 14 The Local Government Board having confirmed such bye-laws (with the exception of those referred to in the 7th paragraph), they are now in force in the district. The Local Government Board have not yet come to a decision with respect to the draft bye-laws as to tents, vans, &c, submitted to them by this Board for confirmation. The Local Government Board have also confirmed the bye-laws made by the London County Council upon the following matters, viz.:— 1.—For prescribing the times for the removal or carriage by road or water of any faecal, or offensive or noxious matter or liquid in or through London, and providing that the carriage or vessel used therefor shall be properly constructed and covered so as to prevent the escape of any such matters or liquid, and as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. 2.—As to the closing and filling up of cesspools and privies. 3.—As to the removal and disposal of refuse, and as to the duties of the occupier of any premises in connection with house refuse so as to facilitate the removal of it by the scavengers of the Sanitary Authority. 4.—With respect to waterclosets, earth closets, privies, ashpits, cesspools, and receptacles for dung, and the proper accessories thereof in connection with buildings, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act. These bye-laws are enforceable by the Board. Copies of all bye-laws are supplied to ratepayers free of charge on application at either of the offices of the Board. Clapham Glebe Estate. An amended application having been received for stopping up the streets and passages on the Globe Estate, Bromell's Road, Clapham, with the view of the houses there being pulled down and the estate laid out in an improved manner, the Board suggested to the Clapham Vestry, which has power to veto the proposal, that as the scheme involved the removal of a great many houses in the occupation of working people provision for housing the persons displaced should be made before the streets were allowed to be stopped up. The matter is still under consideration. 15 Lighting Public Lamps. An application to the Wandsworth, the Brentford, and the Mitcham Gas Companies for a reduction in the price charged for lighting, &c., public lamps having been unsuccessful, the Board considered the advisability of adopting the average meter system, but eventually came to the conclusion that no pecuniary advantage would result therefrom, and no further action was therefore taken in the matter. The Board have, however, now received notice from the Brentford Gas Company that their charge will be reduced as from the 24th June. The prices charged by the respective Companies and other particulars relating to lighting are set out on page 77. Elactric Lighting. The County of London Electric Lighting Company, Limited, referred to in the last Annual Report, applied to the Board of Trade in September last for an extension of time for complying with the provisions of their Order for certain requirements to be carried out within six months. This Board offering no objection, an extension for six months was granted. The Board have now received notice of the intention of the Company to proceed with the laying of mains in the district forthwith. Water Companies' charges On the invitation of the Camberwell Vestry the Board appointed delegates to take part in a conference of representatives from Vestries and District Boards on the subject of the Water Companies' charges. The conference recommended that notices relating to the charges and powers of the Lambeth Water Company should be delivered to consumers in the district of the Company and that each Vestry and District Board should contribute towards the expenses of carrying on the contest in proportion to the rateable value of each represented area provided that the maximum contribution (viz. that of Lambeth) should not in the first instance exceed £100. The Board came to the conclusion that it was not advisable 16 to adopt the suggestion, and decided to contribute the sum of £5 towards the costs which had been incurred in connection with the conference, and to take no further steps in the matter. The subject has. however, since been revived, and the Board have appointed delegates to a further conference, which is now sitting, and have agreed to contribute £100 towards the expenses. Widening The Board having: had under consideration Railway Bridge Trinity Road. the inadequate width of the bridge over the London and South Western Railway at Trinity Road, Wandsworth Common, have asked the London County Council to cause it to be widened and have agreed to contribute one-third of the cost, the contribution not to exceed £1,000. The Council are in negotiation with the Railway Company with the view of carrying out this improvement. Line of Forntage Narbonne Avenue Some houses at the corner of Narbonne and Clapham Common South Side. Clapham Common South Side, having been erected in advance of the adjoining houses there, the Superintending Architect of the London County Council was requested to decide the general lines of buildings in such roads, and his decision was to the effect that the houses were in advance of the general lines. The builders appealed to the Appellate Tribunal constituted under the London Council (General Powers) Act, 1890, against the Superintending Architect's decisions, and the Tribunal varied the decision with regard to Clapham Common South Side by setting the general line still further back, and confirmed his decision with reference to the general line of buildings in Narbonne Avenue. In the meantime an action, arising in another district, had been tried in the Queen's Bench Division with the result that the decision of the Appellate Tribunal in that case was set aside on the ground that one of the members of the Tribunal was a member of 17 the Building Act Committee of the Council which initiated the proceedings. The Appellate Tribunal was similarly constituted at the hearing of the Clapham cases, and it was therefore proposed to have the matter re-heard. The builders thereupon withdrew their appeal, and agreed to set back their buildings to the respective general lines of buildings as defined by the Superintending Architect. This having been done, the summonses which had been issued by the London County Council and the Board in the matter were withdrawn. Repairing October, 1892, the Board having Avenue Road and crescent Lane. executed certain works of repair to Avenue Road under the provisions of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1890, apportioned the cost of the work upon the owners of property there. One of the owners refused to pay the amount charged to him, and proceedings were taken to enforce payment. The Magistrate having decided in favour of the Board, the owner appealed (on the ground that the Magistrate and not the Board was the proper party to decide what were "necessary works of repair") first to the Court of Queen's Bench and thence to the Appeal Court, where the Court, consisting of Lords Justices Lindley, Kay, and Smith, gave an unanimous judgment dismissing the appeal. The Board charged in the same way upon the owners of property the cost of repairing Crescent Lane, Clapham. This lane has been in existence for many years, but is not a parish road. At the time the repairs were undertaken there were posts at one end, which had been erected to prevent the carting of building materials to an adjoining estate. The Magistrate declined to enforce the charge on the ground that the lane had not been open for public carriage traffic for a period of six months immediately before the repairs were executed. As the posts have now been removed this objection will not prevail should it be necessary to execute further repairs to the lane. B 18 Improperly constructing In January, 1893, a summons which had Drains. been issued by the Board under Section 42 of the Public Health (London) Act against a builder for improperly constructing a drain at Carfax Square, Clapham, was dismissed by the Magistrate on the ground that the owner of the premises should have been proceeded against. The Board appealed, and the High Court gave judgment to the effect that the Magistrate's decision was wrong. The case was accordingly re-heard, and the builder fined 10s. and 23s. costs. Fever Hospital and As stated in the last Annual Beport the Infirmary for imbeciles at Tooting. Metropolitan Asylums Board failed to obtain the sanction of the Local Government Board to the purchase of the Tooting Lodge Estate, Tooting Common, for the purpose of erecting a fever hospital there. The Managers subsequently decided to purchase a site for the hospital at Tooting Grove. A public inquiry into the proposal was held by the Local Government Board at the Tooting Vestry Hall on the 8th August. This Board did not oppose the scheme, but pointed out that a public footpath ran across the south-eastern end ot the site, and asked for an assurance that the proposed hospital would not be used for small-pox patients ; several residents and owners of property in the locality attended before the Inspectors and objected to the site on the ground that it was low and damp, and that the erection of the proposed hospital would depreciate the value of their properties. The Bector of Tooting also attended and pointed out that there was only a small unused space for interments at the parish churchyard, and that if the patients who died in the hospital were buried in the parish it would be necessary to provide a cemetery. In answer to these representations the Clerk to the Asylums Board stated that if the Managers desired to divert or stop up the footpath in question the proper legal steps therefor would be taken; that the Managers had not 19 the smallest intention of using the hospital for small-pox patients, as such patients were taken to the hospital ship on the River Thames ; and that with reference to tho burials the Managers had not hitherto claimcd a right to inter patients iu the parish in which their hospitals were situated, and that unless the patients were buried by their friends the Managers carried out the funerals at the Woking cemetery, and that in all probability no patients dying in tho proposed hospital would be buried in Tooting unless they had resided there before their admission into the hospital. The Local Government Board sanctioned the scheme, and temporary buildings were at once erected and are now in use. The Managers have under consideration the plans of the proposed permanent hospital. The Metropolitan Asylums Board did not, however, abandon their intention of purchasing the Tooting Lodge estate, and in February last a public inquiry was held by the Local Government Board at the Tooting Vestry Hall into a proposal by the Managers to acquire the estate for the purpose of erecting thereon an infirmary for imbeciles. This Board decided not to oppose the establishment of the proposed infirmary, provided that the building was used for that purpose only, and supported the suggestion made on behalf of residents in the neighbourhood that if the sanction of the Local Government Board was given to the proposal it should be upon condition that the site should not, under any circumstances, be used as a hospital for cases of infectious diseases. The proposal was sanctioned by the Local Government Board subject to those conditions. The Unemployed. In March, 1893, the Local Government Board wrote to the Board asking for particulars of works of an exceptional character undertaken in the District in consequence of want of employment by the labouring classes, and as to works which would in the ordinary course have been carried out by the Board, but the b 2 20 execution of which had been expedited so that work might be afforded at a period when employment was scarce; also enquiring what action had been taken in founding or promoting labour registries in the District, and any other measures in connection with work for the unemployed; and asking for information with regard to similar efforts in previous years, and as to the extent to which there had been want of employment in the District during the winter months. In reply the Local Government Board were informed that no large exceptional works had been undertaken by the Board, that the sum of £851 3s. 5d. had been expended in the removal of snow and in sanding roads during frost, and that for this purpose men out of work residing in the district were chiefly employed; and that in the winter of 1890-91 a Committee of the Board sat daily in the parish of Wandsworth for the purpose of setting the unemployed to work in scavenging, snow removal, and other works, the number of men thus employed during a period of about three weeks being 204. The Board recorded the fact that on one occasion when the Committee was thus sitting about 120 men applied for work and upon being told that only GO could then be employed they all declined to accept any kind of employment. The Local Government Board were also informed that the experience of the Board led them to the conclusion that able-bodied excavators and general labourers who are set to work by local authorities in times of distress scon get other work, but that there are many old men and weakly young men, and others not used to hard manual labour, who seek employment at such times, and that it was difficult for local authorities to provide for such men, as they were only fitted for light work. labour Bureau. In January last a free labour bureau was opened by the Board at the Town Hall, Wands 21 worth, as it was thought it might be the means of bringing into communication employers and persons out of work. The bureau was kept open for three months, during which time 165 men and 35 women were registered. Handbills were circulated and posted throughout the District giving notice of the establishment of the bureau, but only eight employers of labour inspected the register, and the only person who found employment through the agency of the bureau was a servant girl. The cost incurred was £20 9s. 6d. Streatham Hill Tramways. The London Tramways Company having given notice of their intention to introduce a Bill into Parliament for the extension of their lines along Streatham High Road to Streatham Common South, the matter was carefully considered by the General Purposes Committee, who decided to recommend the Board to consent to the introduction of the Bill, subject to the Company entering into an agreement to construct double lines throughout the whole length of the proposed extension, to pay the cost of widening the roads so as to admit of double lines being laid, and to insert in the Bill the Board's usual protective clauses. In view of the great expense which would be involved in making the necessary widenings in portions of the Streatham High Road, the Company asked for the consent of the Board to the construction of the proposed tramways as far as the Public Library, the remainder to be for the present abandoned, and expressed their willingness to accept the Board's conditions so far as they applied up to the point mentioned. The Board consented to the proposal, and the Bill, as amended, has now passed through the House of Commons. Croydon Tramways Company. The Croydon Tramways Company also gave notice of intention to apply for a provisional order for the extension of their tramways from 22 Thornton Heath along Streatham High Road to the London Tramways Company's present terminus in Streatham High Road, opposite Telford Avenue. The Board were of opinion that it was not expedient to have another Company, and especially one from outside London, working a line which would be practically an unconnected extension of the London Company's tramways, and they declined to consent to the construction of the proposed tramways in their District. The promoters thereupon withdrew from their scheme the portion of the proposed tramway between Telford Avenue and Streatham Common South, and applied to the Board of Trade to dispense with the consent of this Board, which they had power to do, as by the proposed curtailment of the line less than one-third of the whole length would be within this District. The objections of this Board were supported by the London County Council, and the Board of Trade declined to dispense with the required consent. The scheme, so far as regarded this District, had therefore to be abandoned. cable Tramways. In consequence of representations made to the Board of Trade of the noise caused by the cable tramways belonging to the London Tramways Company at Brixton Hill and Streatham Hill and of the danger to the public and damage to houses along the route arising therefrom, a public inquiry was held by Major-General Hutchinson on the 8th December as to the renewal of the licence authorising the use of cable power. This Board did not object to a renewal of the license, but suggested that it should be renewed for one year only, and this course was adopted by the Board of Trade on the understanding that the Company would use every practicable means to reduce as far as possible the nuisance which was complained of. Public Health [(London) Act, 1891, Amendment Bill. This Bill was introduced into Parliament with the object of removing the disability 23 caused by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with regard to the raising of loans for the cost of capital expenditure incurred in connection with the collection and disposal of house and street refuse. This Board supported the Bill, which passed through Parliament without opposition. Local Government (England and Wales Hill, 1894. The President of the Local Government Board having given notice when this Bill was in Committee of his intention to move the insertion of a clause, the effect of which would be to apply to Yestries in London, and so far as respects the qualification of persons to be elected, to Members of District Boards in London, the provisions of the Bill with respect to the qualification of the electors and to the mode of conducting the election, the Board petitioned against the Bill and requested the Members of Parliament for this District to oppose the insertion of the proposed clause. The Board also communicated with the Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis with the view of similar steps being taken by them in the matter. The clause was added to the Bill by the House of Commons and the Board then petitioned the House of Lords against it, urging that legislation affecting the constitution of Yestries and District Boards should be by means of a special Bill for the creation of District Councils, and that such Bill should deal with all local administrative affairs in the Metropolis. The provisions in question, which were opposed by several other Metropolitan local authorities, were thrown out by the House of Lords, but the House of Commons insisted upon these and some other provisions which had been struck out, and eventually the Bill Mas passed retaining them. As might have been anticipated the hurried introduction of these provisions into a Bill which was not intended to deal with London municipal government has created many anomalies and / 24 difficulties which will in all probability have to be rectified by an amending Act. Under the Act the rating qualification of Vestrymen and members of District Boards is practically abolished, and any "parochial elector," and any person who has for twelve months resided in the district, is eligible as a member. Sex or marriage does not disqualify for membership. "Parochial electors " are those who are on such portion of either the Local Government register or the Parliamentary register of electors as relates to the parish. The election of Vestrymen will in future be by ballot. The mode of election of Members of District Boards is not interfered with. District Boards and Vestries in Schedule A are to elect a Chairman for the year, who is to be, by virtue of his office, a Justice of the Peace for the County. At the first meeting of this Board after the election of members in June Mr. Benjamin Weir, who had for many years been elected Chairman at each meeting of the Board, was unanimously elected Chairman for the year. Bills in Parliament. The following Bills, which have been introduced in the present Session, have also been considered by the Board, viz.:— 1 .—Equalisation of Eates (London). 2.—Land Values (Taxation by Local Authorities). 3.—London, Chatham, and Dover Railway. 4.—London County Council (General Powers). 5.—London County Council (Improvements). 6.—London County Council (Tower Bridge Southern Approach). 7.—London County Council (Water). 8.—London Markets. 9.—London Streets and Buildings. 10.—Police (Metropolis). 11.—Public Buildings (London). 12.—Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), &c., Amendment. 13.—Southwark and Vauxhall Water. 14.—Thames Conservancy. 15.—Valuation (Metropolis). 16.—Vehicles Lights. 25 Equalisation of Kates. The Equalisation of Eates (London) Bill, referred to in the last annual report, lias again been brought forward tbis year. The Board presented to the House of Commons the following petition for alteration of the Bill, viz,:— To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District, in the Administrative County of London, under their Common Seal: SiiEWETn 1. That your Petitioners are the Local and Sanitary Authority under the Metropolis Management Acts and the Public Health (London) Act for the District of Wandsworth, which comprises the Parishes of Clapham, Pulney, Streatham, Tooting, and Wandsworth, having an area of over fourteenand-a-half square miles, a population of about 175,000, and a rateable value of £1,120,165. 2. That a Bill (hereinafter referred to as " the Bill ") has been introduced into your Honourable House intituled " A Bill to mate better provision for the equalisation of rates as between different parts of London." 3. Your Petitioners approve of the equalisation of rates in London, but they are of opinion that the system adopted in the Bill for apportioning the Equalisation Fund is inequitable. 4. Clause 1 (1) of the Bill provides that the London County Council shall in every year form a fund, to be called the Equalisation Fund, equal to a rate of 6d. in the £ on the rateable value of London. 5. Clause 1 (2) provides that the London County Council shall determine half-yearly the contribution from each parish to one-half of the Equalisation Fund and the grant due from that one-half of the Fund to each parish. 6. Clause 1 (3) provides that the contribution among the parishes is to be determined in proportion to their rateable value. 7. Clause 1 (4) provides that the grant due shall be determined by apportioning the amount of half the Equalisation Fund among the sanitary districts in proportion to the population, and where a sanitary district comprises two or more parishes by dividing that grant among those parishes in proportion to their population ; with this exception, that where the aggregate of the contributions from the parishes in the district is less than the grant apportioned to the district the difference shall be paid out of the Equalisation Fund to the sanitary authority of the district, and no payment towards any equalisation charge shall be required from any parish in the district. 8. Clause 1 (5) provides that subject as aforesaid where the contribution from a parish is less than the grant due the difference shall be paid out of the Equalisation Fund to the sanitary authority of the district forming or comprising the parish, but if it exceeds the grant due to the parish the 26 Council shall levy on the parish a contribution called the equalisation charge) as a separate item of the County Bate. 9. Clause 1 (6) provides that the sums paid to a sanitary authority shall be applied in defraying expenses incurred under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and so far as not required for that purpose those incurred in respect of lighting, and so far as not required for that purpose those incurred in respect of streets. Where the district of the sanitaiy authority (as in the case of j our Petitioners) comprises two or more parishes, the sum paid is to be apportioned among the parishes in proportion to their population, the amount so apportioned being credited to the parish in reduction of the rates required from such parish. 10. The effect of the Bill in your Petitioners' district, calculated upon the basis of the valuation lists in force for the year 1893-94, would be as follows, viz.:— l 2 3 4 5 6 PARISHES. Amount of Rate at 6d. on rateable value. Amount of Grant based upon population. Difference. Apportionment of Grant in accordance with Clause 1 (0). In favour. Against. £ £ £ £ £ Clapbam 6951 8660 1709 .. 1053 Putney 4148 3522 .. 626 428 Streatbam 8484 8513 29 .. 1035 Tooting 711 1146 435 .. 139 Wandsworth 7024 9268 2234 •• 1126 Total £27,318 £31,099 4,407 £626 £3,781 Less .. .. 626 Amount of Grant from Equalisation Fund.. £3,781 11. The effect of the Bill in your Petitioners' district, calculated upon the basis of the valuation lists in force for the year 1894-95, would be as follows, viz.:— 7 8 9 10 11 12 PARISHES. Amount of Rate at 6d, on rateable value. Amount of Grant based upon Population. Difference. Apportionment of Grant in accordance with Clause 1 (6). In favour. Against. £ £ £ £ Clapbam 7058 8755 1697 .. 958 Putney 4217 3560 • • 657 389 Streatham 8740 8609 • • 131 941 Tooting 721 1158 437 • • 127 Wandsworth 7268 9361 2093 •• 1024 Total .. £28,004 £31,443 4,227 £788 £3,439 Less 788 Amount of Grant from Equalisation Fund.. £3,439 • 27 12. Your Petitioners desire to point out that, as set out in the foregoing paragraph No. 10, the Parish of Putney, if treated as a separate parish, would be called upon to contribute, upon the basis of last year's figures, the sum of £626 to the Equalisation Fund, but as such parish forms part of your Petitioners' district it would receive from the said Fund the sum of £428. 13. As set out in the foregoing paragraph No. 11, the Parishes of Putney and Streatham, if treated as separate parishes, would be called upon to contribute, upon the basis of this year's figures, the sums of £657 and £131 respectively to the Equalisation Fund, but as such parishes form part of your Petitioners' district they would receive from the said Fund the sums of £389 and £941 respectively. 14. The difference in the effect of the Bill upon your Petitioners' district in two successive years, shown by the foregoing paragraphs Nos. 10 and 11, is caused by the increase in the rateable value of your Petitioners' district. This increase of rateable value arises from an increase of the population of the district, but as by Clause 3 of the Bill the population is defined as that of the last published census the population is taken to be stationary for the ten years between each census. Your Petitioners' district and other districts where the opening up of new estates for building purposes is rapidly proceeding are by the operation of this principle placed at a great disadvantage as compared with the more central parts of London, where the population is diminishing. Your Petitioners submit that if the alteration in the rateable value is taken into account in determining the contributions to the Equalisation Fund the estimated alteration in the population should also be taken into acccount in apportioning the grants from such Fund, 15. Your Petitioners submit further that even if the basis of population is to remain that of the latest census, the grant to your Petitioners from the Equalisation Fund for the two periods referred to in the foregoing paragraphs Nos. 10 and 11 should be £4,407 and £4,227 respectively, instead of £3,781 and £3,439 respectively, and that the two former sums should be apportioned amongst the several parishes as shown in columns numbered 4 and 10 respectively. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that Clauses 1 and 3 of the Bill may be amended so as to provide that in determining the grants due from the Equalisation Fund the alterations in the population as well as the alterations in the rateable value since the preceding determination shall be taken into account; and that each parish, whether forming part of the district of a Board of Works or not, shall be dealt with as a separate parish in determining both the contributions to and the grants from the said Fund. The Bill has not yet (June 25th) reached the second reading. General Powers The Board objected to the provisions Bill in the London County Council (General Powers) Bill by which it was proposed to make a Vestry 28 or District Board liable to a penalty of £20 and £5 a day if a street should be closed by them for repairs, &c., without the previous sanction in writing of the Council, or contrary to such conditions as might be prescribed by the Council, and also to the clause providing for lighting from sunset to sunrise common staircases and passages in a building let in flats or tenements Both these clauses have been withdrawn. The Board also objected to the provisions of the Bill which would enable the London County Council to divide Parliamentary boroughs into polling districts in such manner as the Council thought most convenient for taking votes. These provisions were struck out of the Bill by the Committee of the House of Commons. The London County Council (Tower Bridge Southern Approach) Bill contained provisions for imposing on certain lands an improvement charge, upon what is known as the betterment principle, and the Board addressed a communication to the Council urging that the carrying out of the work might not be delayed should the betterment clauses not be passed. London Streets and Buildings. The following report was made by the Clerk upon the London Streets and Buildings Bill, viz.:— This is a private Bill, promoted by the London County Council, " to con" solidate and amend the enactments relating to streets and buildings in " London." The following is an abstract of the clauses of the Bill dealing with matters under the jurisdiction of the Board in which substantial alterations are proposed to be made in the present law :— Clause 2 provides that no street shall be formed without the sanction of the Council. Clause 3 prescribes what is to be evidence of the commencement of a street. I suggest a verbal alteration of this clause, and a similar alteration in the last paragraph of Clause 5. Clause 4 specifies the grounds for ref usal to sanction plans of new streets. Clause 5 prescribes the steps to be taken for converting into a public carriage way or footway ways not previously so used. 29 I suggest that the concluding part of section 98 of 25 and 26 Vict., cap. 102, which provides that ways converted into streets shall be deemed to bo " new streets," and be subject to all the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts as to paving, &c., relating to now streets, should be insertod. The section in question is repealed by the Bill, but the provision above-mentioned is not re-enacted. Clause 6 specifies the grounds for refusal to sanction the conversion of a way into a street. Clause 7 empowers the Council to require that a new street shall be of a greater width than 40 feet (but not exceeding 60 feet), on account of its length or importance, or in consequence of its forming or being so situate as to be likely to form part of an important line of communication, or for other sufficient reason. Clause 8 makes provision for an appeal against the decision of the Council. Clause 9 provides that a new building or structure shall be set back the prescribed distance (i.e., 20 feet in carriage roads and 10 feet in footways) from the centre of the street, the measurement to be taken from the external wall or fence. The Council may in certain cases determine that the prescribed distance in carriage roads shall be greater than 20 feet, but not more than 30 feet. The Council are empowered to consent to buildings, &c., being constructed at a less distance from the centre of the street in any case where they think it expedient. The clause does not provide for the space separating the building or fence being added to the public way. Clause 10 provides for notico being served by the Council to comply with the preceding section. Clauses 11 and 12 deal with the erection of houses, &c., at less than the prescribed distance from the centre of ways net being highways. Clause 13 re-enacts the provisions of section 74 of 25 and 26 Vict., cap. 102, to the effect that if a projecting building be taken down to the extent of more than one half, the new building shall be set back, if required by the Council, who are to compensate the owner. The new clause provides that the Tribunal of Appeal, in assessing the compensation, shall take into consideration any increased value or improvement which may accrue to the building or other property of the same owner by reason of the setting back of the building. I suggest that the clause should be extended so as to provide for the space in front of the building which is set back being added to the public way. Clause 14 empowers the Council, in consenting to the plan of a new street not within two miles of St. Paul's Cathedral, to require that beyond the full width of the road a space not exceeding five feet shall be loft between the footway and the external wall of any building there. Whore the building is used as a dwelling house, this space may be enclosed ; where the building is used wholly or in part for any purpose of retail trade, the space is to be " dedicated to or left open for public use." The section also includes a similar provision to meet the case of a building not erected for purposes of retail trade being afterwards adapted to such purpose. I suggest that the word " and " should be substituted for the word " or " quoted above. 30 Clauses 15 to 18 deal with the erection of buildings beyond the goneral line in a similar way to the present law. Clause 18 provides that the Council may include in the conditions upon which consent is given to erect a building in advance of the general line one to the effect that land in front of the building shall be " dedicated to or left open for the use of the public." This provision is the same as the existing law (45 Vict., cap. 14, sec. 9), and in a case at Clapliam, in May last, it was decided that such a condition did not prohibit the construction of a cellar flap on the land required to be dedicated. The Board then suggested to the Council that the provision should be strengthened by prohibiting tho construction of any coal plate, cellar flap, or opening of any kind in the land given up. The suggested amendment has not however been incorporated in the Bill. I suggest also that tho word "and" should be substituted for the word "or" as in the provision quoted above. Clauses 19 and 20 provide that the consent of the Council to the erection of a building beyond the general line shall not affect the question of the general line as existing at the time of such consent; and that where consent has been given upon condition that land in front shall be given up to the public, adjoining or neighbouring buildings are not to be brought forward unless land to the same line be also given np. These clauses carry into effect the suggestions which the Board made to the Council on the subject in May last. I suggest, however, the same verbal alterations as in Clauses 14 and 18. Clause 21 empowers the Superintending Architect to determine by his certificate in what street or way a building is situate. As the existing provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts with regard to the general line of buildings would be repealed by the Bill, and the part of such provisions which authorise local authorities to take proceedings in the matter is not re-enacted, it follows that should the Bill pass in its present form the Council only will have power to take such proceedings in future. Local authorities are, however, as at present, to be served with notice of the Superintending Architect's certificate, and may appeal against the same. Clauses 22 to 28 deal with the re-naming of streets and re-numbering of houses. Clause 29 provides that when a new domestic building is erected, not fronting upon a public way, an open space not less than 40 feet in width shall be left in front of the building. Clause 30 deals with the space to be left at rear of new buildings, and provides that such space shall, in the case of a domestic building, be free from any erection above the level of the ground except a water closet, earth closet, or privy, and a receptacle for ashes and enclosing walls, none of which erections shall exceed nine feet in height, and in the case of a building other than a domestic building, the space shall be free from any erection exceeding 12 feet in height. The clause also provides that the open space shall extend laterally throughout the entire width of the building, and that the distance across the open space, from every part of the building to the boundary of the premises, shall be not less than 10 feet. Those provisions meet some objections to the present law which have been frequently brought under the notice of the Board. 31 The same clause prescribes that the relation between the height of any new building and the space required in rear thereof, shall be fixed and determined as follows :— A line (called the horizontal line) is to be drawn at right angles to the road, through or directly over a point in front of the centre of the building, and produced to intersect the boundary of the open space furthest from the road. A second line (called the diagonal line) is to be drawn in the direction of the building above and in the same vertical plane with the horizontal line, and inclined thereto at an angle of 45 degrees, and meeting the horizontal line where it intersects the boundary of the space furthest from the road. No part of the building is to extend above the diagonal line except chimneys, dormers, gables, turrets, or other architectural ornaments, aggregating in all to not more than one-third of the width of the rear elevation of the building. I suggest a verbal alteration at the end of sub-clause (d), so as to make the wording thereof the same as in sub-clause (6), Clause 31 modifies clause 9, &c., by providing that whenever a domestic building, abutting on a street or way less than 40 feet wide, is erected upon a site which has been occupied by a domestic building within seven years of the commencement of the Act, the new domestic building shall not be subject to the provisions of the Act prohibiting the erection of buildings at less than the prescribed distance from the centre of the road, provided that there be left between the external wall of the building as re-erected and the centre of the road a clear space which throughout the whole length of the external wall shall measure, between such external wall and the centre of the road, either not less than 20 feet, or (if the building nowhere exceeds 40 feot in height) not less than one-half of the height of the building. In any such case the owner may enclose, with a fence not more than seven feet in height, any portion of his ground on which, under the provisions of tho clause, new buildings will be prohibited. Clause 32 prescribes rules for the calculation in special cases of the amount of open space to be provided. Clause 33 deals with tho enlargement or rebuilding of existing buildings which contravene this portion of the Bill. Clause 34 relates to courts or shafts within a building constructed for purposes of light and air. Clause 35 empowers the Superintending Architect to determine which is the front and which is the rear of tho building. Clause 36 provides that a building (not being a church or chapel) shall not be erected to a greater height than 75 feet (exclusive of two storeys in the roof and of ornamental towers, turrets, or other architectural features or decorations) without the consent of the Council. Clause 37 prescribes the procedure to be followed where greater height is allowed. Clause 38 provides that buildings shall not be erected, without the consent of the Council, so that the height of the building shall exceed the distance of the front or nearest external wall of tho building from the opposite side of any street or way upon which it may abut. 32 Clause 39 to 135 relate to the construction of buildings, special and temporary buildings, the rights of building and adjoining owners, dangerous and neglected structures, dangerous and noxious businesses, dwelling-houses on low-lying land, sky signs, and the appointment and duties of Superintending Architect and District Surveyors. Clause 60 will meet a defect in the present law under which it was decided that a shop front might be erected so as to project 10 inches beyond the external wall of the building, even if the projection appropriated ground which had been previously purchased by the local authority for widening the thoroughfare. The clause as now drawn prohibits any such projection other than the cornice on or over the public way. Clause 129 continues the system of the payment of fees to the District Surveyors, but the provisions of the Building Act enabling the Council to determine to pay the District Surveyors a fixed salary and to require the foes to be paid over to the Council are re-enacted. This Board have expressed an opinion that the duties of the District Surveyors should be transferred to the local authorities. Clause 136 authorises the Council to make bye-laws. Amongst other matters, bye-laws may be made regulating lamps, signs, or other structures overhanging the public way. This will meet the representations which have been made to the Council as to the defective condition of the law on this subject. Clause 139 provides that on the representation of the Secretary of State an Order in Council may be made assigning exclusively to one magistrate the execution of the duties to be performed by a Petty Sessional Court under the Act, with or without the execution of any duties to be performed by a Justice under the Metropolis Management Acts or any Act amending the same or empowering the Council to make any new street or execute any work, or of any other duties. ClauEes 140 to 149 relate to legal proceedings. Clauses 150 to 161 relate to the Tribunal of Appeal, which is in future to be constituted as follows, viz:—one member to be appointed by a Secretary of State ; one by the Council of the Royal Institute of British Architects ; one by the Council of the Institution of Civil Engineers ; one by the Council of the Institution of Surveyors; and one by the London County Council. No member or officer of the Loudon County Council is to be a member of the Tribunal. Members are to be appointed for a term of three years. There is an appeal to this Tribunal in many matters dealt with by the Bill. Clauses 165 to 168 deal with the appointment of officers to carry out the Act, the payment of expenses, power to annex conditions to consent of Council, anctpower of entry. Clause 169 provides that when any building has been erected or work done without due notice being given to the District Surveyor the time during which he may take proceedings shall begin to run from the date of discovery. Clauses 170 to 173 relate to plans, mode of giving approval, saving clauso for contracts, &c. Clause 175 prohibits the future stacking of timber nearer to a street than 33 the buildings forming the general line of buildings therein, and contains other provisions relating to timber yards. Clause 176 provides that tablets, &c., attaolied after the commencement of the Act to the external walls of buildings for the purposos of advertisement shall be constructed of fire-resisting materials throughout, and shall not be so placed as to cover more than one-fourth of the area of any window, Clause 179 provides penalties for offences against the Act, Clause 180 deals with exceptions from certain provisions of the Act, Clause 185 is the definition clause. Clauses 186 to 192 relate to the repeal of existing onactments, bye-laws, &c., made and officers appointed, &c., under repealed Acts, the extent of the Act and its title, and provide that it shall come into operation on tho 1st of January next after tho passing thereof. The first schedule contains regulations with regard to the structure of buildings. The second schedule prescribes the materials which are to be deemed fire-resisting. The third schedule prescribes the fees payable to District Surveyors. The fourth schedule sets out the enactments to bo repealed. This Board in January last suggested to the London County Council that Parliamentary powers should bo obtained, when opportunity arose, requiring persons to send in proper plans with the notices of buildings and drains given to local authorities under section 76 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. This subject is not dealt with by the Bill, but the section above-mentioned is not in any way interfered with. The suggestions in the foregoing report were generally adopted by the Board, and the Clerk was instructed to give evidence before the Parliamentary Committee in support of Clauses 19 and 20, which were inserted in the Bill at the request of the Board. The Bill is now under the consideration of a Committee o! the House of Commons. The Board petitioned against the Police Bill, which proposed to transfer the control of the policc of the Metropolis from the Home Secretary to the London County Council. The Bill has not yet been read a second time. The Board petitioned in favour of the Public Buildings (London) Bill, the object of which is to empower local c 34 authorities in London to purchase compulsorily, under the provisions of the Lands Clauses Acts, land for the erection thereon of public buildings. The Board were of opinion that the powers contained in the Bill would be very useful, as difficulty is often experienced in obtaining a suitable site for public buildings owing to the prohibitory price asked by the owners and to the objection of owners to part with their property for such purposes. Adulteration of Food, &c. One of the chief objects of the Bill for the amendment of the Sale of Food, &c., Acts was to bring the wholesale dealer within the provisions of the Acts. The Board were of opinion that the Bill would not effect this object, but that on the contrary it would hinder the local authorities in carrying out the Acts. They therefore petitioned against the Bill, and suggested that the object would be best met by repealing the section of the existing Act which relates to a warranty, and substituting therefor a provision whereby the retail dealer charged with an offence under the Acts should be entitled to have brought before the Court the person from whom he purchased the article, and that upon proof that the article was sold in the same state in which it was received such person should be liable to be convicted of the offence. The Bill was withdrawn, and a Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to inquire into the whole subject of the working of the Acts. A conference of Delegates of Vestries and District Boards has since been convened by the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, to consider the subject, at which a resolution, introduced by this Board's delegates, to the effect of the foregoing suggestion, was agreed to. Some other resolutions, with the object of facilitating the administration of the Acts, were also passed, and the views of the conference ordered to be placed before the Parliamentary Committee. 35 valuation Bill. The following abstract of the report of the Clerk upon the provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Bill describes the object and scope of this measure:— The Bill is the outcome of the conference of London assessment authorities with the Local Government Taxation Committee of the Council convened by the Council, and which sat for about a year discussing questions of assessment procedure. The conference, with only six dissentients, finally passed the following resolution, viz.: — "That this conference of representatives and officers of the Overseers and " Assessment Committees of the Metropolis is of opinion that the "Valuation (Metropolis) Bill, as now settled, embodies a desirablo " amendment of the law, and may fairly receive the support of the "authorities of the various Metropolitan parishes." Under the provisions of the Bill the London County Council will make bye-laws regulating the practice of Assessment Committees, Overseers, and others in the assessment of property. In the third or fourth year of every quinquennial period the Council will convene a conference of representatives of Overseers and Assessment Committees to deliberate upon questions relating to the practice of assessment, and to consider proposals for alterations of bye-laws, &c. The Council will nominate persons to represent it (but not to vote) at meetings of Overseers and Assessment Committees; will have power to make objections to the valuation lists before the Assessment Committee ; and to appeal to the Valuation Court which is to be established by the Bill against the decision of the Assessment Committee. Ratepayers, Surveyors of Taxes, and Overseers may appeal against the valuation list to the Valuation Court. A Valuation Court is to be established, to consist of three persons appointed by the Queen, one of whom is to be a barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years' standing, one a member of the Surveyor's Institution of not less than ten years' standing, and one a person (not being a solicitor, barrister, or surveyor) of experience in the assessment of property. The provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, relating to appeals to sessions are repealed by the Bill, and the proposed Valuation Court takes the place of such sessions. Owing to the pressure of work the General Assessment Session has not been able to deal promptly with a large number of appeals which were of great importance. The hearing of one of these appeals occupied the Court for 25 days, and was spread over a period of ten months. It was therefore thought expedient by the promoters of the Bill to establish a special tribunal to deal with assessment cases. The Council is to make a valuation of railways, tramways, canals, docks, water-works, gas-works, hydraulic power works, telegraph works, telephone works, and electric works, which extend into more than one parish in the Metropolis, and to apportion the rateable value thereof between the several parishes into which such works, &c., extend. Provision is made enabling parties affected to object to the valuation and to be heard by the Council or its Committee c 2 36 At present the London County Council has no power with regard to valuation or assessments, except that of appealing as a "body of persons authorised by law to levy rates " against the total of the gross or rateable value of any parish, and of appealing against assessments in districts where the Council is a ratepayer. The Bill confers extensive powers upon the Council with the view of securing greater uniformity in the valuation of proporty. There is no doubt that in the past there has boon very considerable divergence among Assessment Authorities in valuing property, and as a large proportion (about two-thirds) of the rates raisad are paid to central bodies, based on the rateable value of the contributing district, this divergonco operates unfairly upon those parishes where property is assessed at the higher valuation. The Board decided to approve the principle of the Bill, which has not yet reached the second reading. The Board petitioned in favour of the Vehicles Lights Bill, the object of which was to require all vehicles on highways not lighted by gas, electricity, or other means, to carry lights during the period between one hour after sunset and one hour before sunrise. The Bill has, however, been dropped. The Board took no action with regard to the other Bills above-mentioned. The London County Council (Water) Bill was withdrawn. Protection from Fire. The Board have on several occasions called the attention of the London County Council to the need in the District of increased protection from fire. The Fire Brigade Committee of the Council having considered the whole question, brought up a series of recommendations for increasing the number of fire stations, &c., throughout the Metropolis. The matter was referred back to such Committee with instructions to report as to which stations should be established during the present financial year; and so far as regards this district the Council have decided to establish a fire engine station at Streatham, to station a fire escape at Lower Streatham, to fix five fire alarms in the locality, to establish a small fire station at Brixton Hill, and to station fire escapes at Balham Hill and East Hill, 37 Wandsworth. Pending the erection of the permanent tire engine station at Streatham it is proposed to place a street station there. The Board have also urged upon the Council the necessity for a steam fire engine being again stationed at the Clapham fire station. Government of London. The London County Council have had under consideration the desirability of making bye-laws for the good rule and government of London, apart from bye-laws dealing with special subjects made under special Acts of Parliament, and the Council invited the Vestries and District Boards to make suggestions as to subjects upon which it seemed to them bye-laws might usefully be made. The Board have suggested that bye-laws should be made dealing with the following matters, viz.:— (а) Obstruction of thoroughfares by offering goods for sale. (b) Annoyance by shooting galleries, swing boats, &c. (c) Occupation of land by squatters, gipsies, &c. Dorothy Appleby's Charity. In March, 1890, the Board, at the suggestion of the Streatham Local Board of Guardians, joined in an application to the Charity Commissioners for a revised scheme for the administration of Dorothy Appleby's Charity, whereby the whole of the income would be devoted to apprenticeships. When the bequest was made the income from the charity was £7 10s. Od. per annum, of which sum £5 was left for apprenticeships and the remainder for the repair of a specified part of the Streatham High Road. The income at the time of the application to the Commissioners was £25 per annum, and the Board agreed to waive their claim to any portion of the fund for the repair of the highway. The Charity Commissioners having, however, declined to consent to the proposed new scheme, the Board in November last revoked their resolution of March, 1890, and applied to the Local Board of Guardians for payment of the balance available for road repairs which they had in hand. This balance (£149 5s. 5d.) has been paid to 38 the Board, and the future proceeds of the charity, after deducting £5 per annum for apprentice fees and the costs of the administration of the charity, will in like manner he paid over to the Board. Disinfecting Public Vehicles. The Board have received a communication from the Metropolitan Asylums Board pointing out that notwithstanding the prohibition contained in section 70 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, infectious cases are occasionally taken to hospitals in public vehicles, and enquiring whether the Board were in a position to undertake the disinfection of such vehicles, and if so, where. The Board had made arrangements with their contractor for the disinfecting of public vehicles which had been used for persons residing in the District suffering from infectious disease, but they were of opinion that it would be for the public advantage that vehicles which had been used for conveying patients to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be disinfected before they leave the hospital, and they informed the Asylums Board accordingly, and intimated that they would be willing to pay for the cost of disinfecting any public vehicle which had been used for the conveyance to the hospital of a person residing in this District. The Metropolitan Asylums Board, however, declined to undertake such disinfection, and the Board have now forwarded to the Local Government Board a copy of the correspondence and have requested them to support the views of this Board in the matter. Combined Drainage. A conference of representatives of Vestries and District Boards was convened by the Board of Works for the Holborn District in May last to consider some difficulties which had arisen with regard to the liability for repairs to drains which are used for the drainage of a group or block of houses by a combined operation. The 39 conference adopted a resolution in favour of an extension of the definition of the word "drain" in the Metropolis Management Acts, and decided to present a memorial to the London County Council asking the Council to insert in one of its Bills for the amendment of* those Acts a provision carrying into effect the suggested extended definition. This memorial is now under the consideration of the Council. Death of a Member and Officers. The Board regret to have to record the death of Mr. S. F. Sloper, one of the Members for the parish of Wandsworth; also of Dr. G. E. Nicholas, after the long service of 38 years as Medical Officer of Health for Wandsworth, his appointment dating from the establishment of the Board in January, 1856, by the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855; and of Mr. G. Phimister, who had been engaged as a Sanitary Inspector for Streatham for 13 years. 40 ORDERS OF APPORTIONMENT.

In the Parish of Clapham 310 feet lineal of new 4 feet 6 inch by 3 feet brick sewer (including 16 feet lineal of bell-mouth) have been constructed in Kendoa Road, and connected to the London County Council's sewer in Bedford Road. This work was done in order that an old sewer running through private land between High Street and Bedford Road might be abolished and the land laid out for building purposes. Five tenders were invited for the construction of the sewer, the lowest amounting to £170. The Board, however, decided to execute the work without the intervention of a contractor. The total cost was £464, towards which Mr. Gregory Foster, the owner of the land, contributed £300. Nine gullies have been constructed, and 5 surface ventilators have been closed and iron pipe ventilators erected instead thereof, at a cost of £93. In addition, £92 has been expended in the repair of gullies and sewers in various parts of the parish. In new roads, 1,644 feet lineal of new pipe sewers, 7 manholes, 6 surface ventilators, 1 iron pipe ventilator, and 40 new gullies have been constructed at the cost of the owners of adjoining property. In the Parish of Putney 633 feet of new 12 inch pipe sewer, with 2 manholes and 8 gullies in connection therewith, have been constructed in a new road (a continuation of St. John's Road) by the owner of the property there, under the superintendence of the Board. Five new gullies have been constructed by the Board, at a cost of £21 19s. 2d., and 5 gullies re-constructed at a cost of £12 0s. 4d.; 2 new manholes have also been constructed at a cost of £13 9s. 6d.; and various alterations and repairs to sewers, manholes, and gullies carried out at a cost of £33 10s. 6d. The gullies, numbering 878, have been regularly cleansed, 45 emptied, and disinfected, and all sewers and manholes have been frequently flushed. In the Parish of Streatham 7,826 feet of new sewers, 25 manholes, 27 ventilators, and 42 gullies, with about 698 feet of G inch pipe drains thereto, have been constructed during the year, and sewer junctions have been provided for 40 gullies not yet constructed, all under the supervision of the officers of the Board, at the cost of the owners of the estates or others where new roads have been laid out. In Leigham Court Road, between Greta House and "Bernina," the sewer having been found to be defective, the Board decided to take out the old 15 inch pipes and substitute therefor 18 inch pipes, surrounded with Portland cement concrete; this work has been completed at a cost of £611 l6s. 2d. The length of the new portion is 1,076 feet. All the sewers, gullies, manholes, &c., have been cleansed, flushed, and disinfected, and where necessary, altered and repaired, at a cost of £377 4s. 4d. for cleansing, and £65 1s. for repairs. The sum of £102 l1s. 7d. has been expended in the maintenance of the public urinals at Bedford Hill and Streatham Hill, and the underground convenience near Streatham Church. The pence received at the underground convenience during the vear amounted to £13 4s. 1d. In the Parish of Tooting the sewers, gullies, manholes, &c., have been cleansed, flushed, and disinfected, and where necessary, altered and repaired, at a cost of £60 10s. 3d. for cleansing, and £37 1s, 9d. for repairs.

During the making up of various private roads, 22 new gullies have been constructed, and 21 manholes have been brought up to the surface, and proper iron covers with dirt boxes provided in connection therewith, at the expense of the owners. Six new gullies have been provided in various public roads at a cost of £27, and a manhole with tidal flap for flushing purposes has been constructed at the head of the sewer in Point Pleasant at a cost of £7. Twelve surface sewer ventilators have been sealed, and twelve 6 inch by 4 inch iron ventilating pipes have been fixed against buildings and connected to sewers in lieu of same at a cost of £56 Is. 8d. The gullies have been periodically flushed, cleansed, and disinfected, and the sewers where necessary have also been flushed and cleansed.

In order to provide better facilities for disposing of the house refuse the Board are negotiating for the purchase of the old " Feathers " public-house site, having an area of about three-quarters of an acre, with a frontage to the River Thames of about 116 feet and to Bell Lane Creek of about 142 feet. During the year 12,623 loads of slop were collected. £244 14s. 4d. was paid by the Board for a shoot for 7,468 loads, 'the remainder being carted to fill up old ditches and excavations in various parts of the parish. The Board are negotiating for the purchase of about 21 acres of land to be used as a slop shoot, and eventually as a recreation ground or for allotments. It is anticipated that a considerable saving will be effected by this purchase, as the disposal of the road scrapings is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive. 73 REMOVAL OF SNOW.

The general arrangement will be found to conform with Reports of former years, and in presenting it wo draw your attention with satisfaction to the indications it gives of the progress made in the sanitation of the district. We would also record our deep regret at the loss of our late colleague, Dr. Edward Nicholas, Medical Officer of Health for Wandsworth, who had held the appointment since the first creation of the Board, and was one of the first Medical Officers of Health appointed in London, and whose kindly readiness to help, and ripe experience will long be much missed by us. We have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, The Medical Officers of Health for the Wandsworth District. 93 REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE ENTIRE DISTRICT, 1893. VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The population estimated in the usual way to the middle of 1893 was 168,999, being an increase of 6,754 on the preceding year. Births. The total number registered during the year was 4,589, of which 2,375 were males and 2,214 females. The number of births and the birth.rates in the several sub.districts, are compared in the following Table:— TABLE I. BIRTHS. RATES. Sub.Districts. Males. Females. Total. Birth.rate. Rate of Natural Increase. Clapham 583 519 1102 24.2 11.01 Putney 22 1 238 462 24.7 11.1 Streatham 620 586 1206 25.6 13.2 Tooting 101 112 213 40.1 19.0 Wandsworth 847 759 1606 31.9 18.3 Whole District 2375 2214 4589 27.1 13.0 94 The birth-rate was 27.l per thousand compared with 2623 in the preceding year. The mean rate for the preceding 10 years was 29.2. The birth-rate for the whole of London was 31.0. Reference to Table III. shows the marked tendency to become lower displayed by the birth-rate. The natural increase of the population calculated by the excess of births over deaths was 13.0 per thousand. Deaths. The number of deaths was 2,376, of which 1,229 were males and 1,147 females. Of these, however, 205 were of inhabitants of other parts of London and the country, who died in institutions in this district, such as the Workhouse, the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum, the Hospital for Incurables, &c. The following Table gives the distribution in the subdistricts:— TABLE II. DEATHS. Death-rate. Sub-Districts. Males. Females. Total.

The following Table shows the rates for the last 10 years:— TABLE III. Birth-rates, Death-rates, and rates of Natural Increase in the entire district during the ten years 1883—92 inclusive. Years.

The death-rate for London in 1893 was 21.2. Deaths in Outlying Institutions. In addition to the deaths above enumerated, those deaths of inhabitants of this district that occurred without its borders have to be considered. 96 In the following Table the deaths properly belonging to the district occurring in outlying institutions have been arranged according to the character of the institution in which they occurred and the sub-districts to which they belong.

Adding these deaths to the 2,376 mentioned above, and substracting the 205 that, as explained, ought to be 97 excluded, we get a total of 2,602, giving a death-rate of 15.3. This is the nearest to a correct death-rate at which wo can arrive. The corresponding figure for last year was 15.7. It will be seen also from this Table that for every 1,000 living there died in the Outlying Institutions:— 1892. 1893.

There were 405 deaths belonging to this class registered compared with 450 in the previous year, giving a zymotic death-rate of 2.39 per 1,000 living. This is compared with that of the last five years in the following Table, which also gives the rates for the sub-districts.

There were 29 cases reported in the district. Throughout London there was considerable prevalence of the disease during the summer months and it did not disappear during the winter. Early in the year a letter was received from the clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board forwarding an extract from a letter of the Medical Superintendent of the Smallpox Ships, from which it appeared that nearly all the cases admitted to the ships were of persons belonging to the vagrant class, that the disease was imported by tramps from the provinces, and had not at that time taken any hold on the settled population of London. This was under the consideration of the Sanitary Committee in March, and it was decided that more frequent visits should be made to the common lodging houses in the district with the view of inquiring whether any illness occurred among the lodgers. No cases of smallpox were heard of in this way however. The Clerk also wrote to the Clerk of the Guardians to inquire what was done in regard to the medical inspection of inmates of the casual wards. In reply a copy of a report of the Medical officer of the Workhouse was sent stating that the Superintendent had strict instructions to send for him if any of the occupants appeared ill, even though they did not complain, and that he did not think that regular inspection was advisable. The facts as to the exclusive incidence of smallpox on the vagrant class did not told good throughout the year, however, as the resident popu lation also became affected. Some particulars of the cases that occurred in this district are given in the local reports. Every effort has been made by prompt removal to hospital, by thorough disinfection, and the urging of re-vaccination on persons who have been exposed to infection, to limit the spread of this disease. 104 Scarlet Fever.—67 deaths were due to this cause, 38 at the Isolation Hospitals and 29 at their homes. 1256 cases were notified compared with 887 in 1892. This district in common with the rest of London suffered from a serious epidemic of scarlet fever. The available hospital accommodation was exhausted by the middle of June, and from that time onwards there was very great difficulty and delay in obtaining the removal of patients. This difficulty was partially overcome by the opening of the Fountain Hospital at Tooting, but we can not doubt that the spread of the disease was extended by the non-removal of illisolated cases. The case mortality during the year was 5.3 per cent. 598 patients were removed to hospital or 47.6 per cent. of the whole and the mortality of those removed was 6.3 per cent. and of those not removed 4.4. During 1892, 50.3 per cent. of the total number notified were removed to the Isolation Hospitals. Diphtheria.—During the year 398 cases of diphtheria and 33 of membranous croup were reported, as compared with 242 and 17 in the previous year. There were 99 deaths from diphtheria; 54 at their homes and 45 at the hospitals, and 17 from membranous croup, all at their own homes. The case mortality of the two diseases together was therefore 26.9 per cent. This shows how large a proportion of the cases reported succumb, and should emphasize the necessity for more extended recognition of the infectiousness of diphtheria, and also of the importance of isolating doubtful cases of sore throat. Of the whole number, 121 or 28 per cent. were removed to hospital, so that the mortality at home and at the hospitals was 22.9 and 37.2 per hundred cases respectively. Enteric Fever.—The number of cases was 108, compared with 86 last year. The number of deaths was 18, 105 pared with 12. The case mortality was 17.6 per cent. There was also one death from continued fever, of which there were six cases notified. Puerperal Fever.—Twenty-one cases were reported, and there were eight deaths, compared with seven last year. Erysipelas.—373 cases were reported, and there were 17 deaths, compared with 274 and 16 in 1892. Measles.—Only 33 deaths were registered from this cause, compared with 78 last year, and considerably below the decennial average. it hooping Cough caused 77 deaths, also slightly below the decennial average. Influenza.—64 deaths were referred to this cause, whereas 112 were due to it last year, when the prevalence of this disease reached its maximum, and has since gradually declined. It may be fairly hoped that we shall have a succession of years with but little experience of influenza, as, though no doubt it is a truly infectious disease, there appears to be a predisposition needed for epidemic influenza to exist in a population, which predisposition appears to become exhausted in a few years, if we may judge by the experience of former epidemics. These deaths, referred here to influenza, were due to complications, generally bronchitis and pneumonia, and not simply to influenza. The same method is followed in classifying the deaths from all the other zymotic diseases, that is, referring to them all deaths from their complications, even though the zymotic illness may be but a remote cause of death. Diarrhoea caused 114 deaths, compared with 51 and 82 in the two preceding years. This number exceeded the B 106 decennial average, as was to be expected from the unusually warm summer. Deaths from Non-zymolic Diseases. —On comparing these deaths with those of previous years, it is satisfactory to notice in the figures a tendency to diminish under most of the headings. This is markedly so under the headings of tubercular, nervous, circulatory, and respiratory diseases. It is also so to a less extent in cancers and other tumours. The progressive and considerable fall in the number of deaths from tubercular diseases is extremely satisfactory. The number during the year was 228, or 58 below the corrected decennial average. From premature birth and low vitality 199 children died, a distinct increase, and exceeding the decennial average. Inquests. The next Table gives particulars of the number of inquests held and the verdicts returned. There were 59 verdicts of death from natural causes, 46 from accidents, 13 from suicide, 5 from homicide, and in the remaining 6 inquests open verdicts were returned. 107 TABLE X. INQUESTS. Clapham.

Early in the year the possibility of cholera becoming epidemic in the district engaged our attention and in April we presented the following report to your Sanitary Committee:— THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE WANDSWORTH DISTRICT. To the Sanitary Committee. CHOLERA. Gentlemen, The Local Government Board in their circular letter of August 25th, 1892, on the above subject, stated that in the event of an outbreak of Cholera in London, they would issue Regulations under section 134 of the Public Health Act, 1875, whereby they would impose on the Sanitary Authority the duty of making arrangements for the prevention and treatment of Cholera, and among the arrangements would be comprised the visitation of poorer houses for the purpose of detecting Cholera and Diarrhœa, the supply of medical attendance and medicine, nursing, and disinfectants, the destruction of infected clothing; the disinfection of houses ; and tho prompt interment of the dead. The arrangements would also include the provision of such additional accommodation in hospitals and " places of refuge " as might be necessary for the several parishes and districts, the hospitals being provided for the reception of those Cholera patients who could not be properly treated at their own homes, the "places of refuge" for the lodgment of those persons not actually sick, but whom it might be right to keep under observation, or to accommodate while their house was undergoing disinfection, or devoted to a sick person who could not properly be removed. It therefore becomes necessary to be prepared with the following arrangements in accordance with the regulations referred to, viz.: — 1.—Hospital accommodation. 2.—Places of refuge. 3.—Visitation of the poorer houses. 4.—Medical attendance. 5.—Nurses, nourishments, &c. 6.—Disinfection of houses. 7.—Destruction of infected clothing. 8.—Prompt interment of the dead. 1. With regard to hospital accommodation we do not now report, as the question is under the consideration of the several Local Committees, 109 Wo would remind you, however, that on the Metropolitan Asylums Board would devolve the duty first of all of providing accommodation, as the hospital authority for London, and only on their failure to provide sufficient beds, would your Board be called upon to make such provision. 2. The provision of places of refuge we consider of even more practical importance than that of hospitals, as it is known that only a small proportion of the cases can be removed to hospital without risk of death taking place in the ambulance, owing to the sadden onset and rapid course of Asiatic Cholera. It thereforo follows that many cases must remain in their homes, which would involve the provision of sufficient accommodation for the healthy members of families in which cases occurred. We beg to suggest that the Guardians should be approached as to their willingness to graut tho use of wards in the Workhouse (not the Infirmary) for this purpose, should necessity arise, the pauper inmates being temporarily boarded out. If this arrangement were found to be feasible it would meet the requirements of a large part of the district. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. With regard to the duties relating to the general treatment of the sick, &c., we are of opinion that they would be best performed by the adoption of the arrangements which were satisfactorily carried out during the Cholera epidemics of 1854 and 1866, and which were as follows:—The Local Committees were deputed by the Board to fulfil tho instructions contained in an "Order iu Council" (which corresponded with the regulations herein referred to). The assistance and co-operation were invited of all the registered medical practitioners residing in the district, of whom a certain number undertook the treatment of all persons suffering from the epidemic, who might apply to them by night or by day, and were authorised to order nurses, nourishment, stimulants, and disinfectants, or whatever was nccessary for such treatment, Additional inspectors were appointed, who made a careful house-to-house visitation, and brought to the notice of the medical attendant any case of the disease they met with, effected tho removal of any existing sanitary defect, ensured an early interment of tho dead, the destruction of infected clothing unfit to be otherwise dealt with, and the disinfection of the house. They also furnished disinfectants to all applicants needing them. 110 The system above set forth presents a great advantage in favour of the safety of the patient by preventing the loss of much valuable time,—so important in tbe treatment of this fatal disease. We suggest, therefore, that a circular be drawn up to be sent to all registered medical practitioners residing in the district, inviting their co-operation ; and that, further, the Local Committees should arrange with a sufficient number, living in convenient positions in each parish, who would be willing to hold themselves in readiness to undertake the early treatment of persons suffering from Cholera or Diarrhoea night and day. We would suggest that you should consider what scale of remuneration should be adopted. The provision of nurses is a matter that would require some organisation, and would present some difficulties. We are making enquiries as to what arrangements might be made, and hope to be in a position shortly to give you some information on the subject. 21st April, 1893. Accordingly a circular was sent to cach medical practitioner in the district inviting his co-operation, and asking him if he would be willing to attend at once, night or day, on cases of cholera or diarrhoea, should it bccome epidemic. A large number of favourable replies were received, so that there would have been no difficulty in getting immediate medical treatment for any eases had they occurred. The next point was the provision of hospital accommodation. On August 26th a circular was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board, giving particulars of hospitals and infirmaries, at which beds were promised to be allotted to cholera patients, and also a list of stations where ambulance litters were provided. No institution, however, within this district, had undertaken to provide beds, so that the only available provision was in the hospitals belonging to the Asylums Board, and other institutions at some distance, such as St. Thomas's 111 Hospital. Meanwhile arrangements had been made in each parish of the district to provide a temporary isolation hospital, and sites were made available for that purpose. Plans also were prepared, so that everything was in readiness for the hospitals to be proceeded with at a moment's notice. Particulars of the different plans adopted will be found in the local reports, Of course nothing could be actually done in the erecting of the buildings until the Local Government Board issued the Epidemic Regulations under the Public Health Acts, which, luckily, it did not become necessary to do. The provision of places of refuge (that is for healthy people removed from infected houses, and whom it might be desirable to keep under observation), it was considered, could be met by hiring unoccupied houses, as might be required, it is a matter of satisfaction that this district was in a state of preparedness; still more so that the work done last year will be available this year, should the danger recur. Cholera, however, did not spread iu the Metropolis. Cases were brought into the Thames from infected ports, from July 17th onwards, but were not proved to have infected any other persons. A number of suspicious cases were reported in various parts of London in September and October, but only four were proved to be true Asiatic Cholera. These all occurred in September, in Westminster, Fulham, Lambeth, and Southwark, and all died. They were not traced to any imported case, and did not spread to other persons 112 Vaccinati The next Table kindly supplied to us by the Clerk of the Guardians shows the amount of vaccination performed in the district. Out of 4,236 births registered in 1892, 3,223 children were returned as successfully vaccinated, whilst 479 were unaccounted for from various causes, or 11.3 per cent. of the total births, compared with 8.6 per cent. in the previous year:— TABLE XII.

In our last Report we stated that bye-laws under sections 16, 29, 50 and 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, had been framed on the foundation of the model bye-laws drawn up by the Local Government Board, and that they were then awaiting confirmation by that Board. The result was, however, that no additions to or alterations in the model bye-laws were allowed by the Local Government Board, so that they were finally made and confirmed in that form. The advantage of this was that the bye- laws under these sections were made uniform throughout London. Sanitary Proceedings.

Population. The population in the middle of 1893 estimated in the usual way was 45,537, an increase of 826 over the previous year. Births and Birth-rate. The number of births registered during the year was 1,102, of which 583 were males and 519 females. This is an increase on the previous year, but less than in 1891. The birth-rate was 24.2 as compared with 23.5 last year. Table I. shows the tendency for the birth-rate to decrease which has been very marked during the last ten years. The rate of natural increase, reckoned from the excess of births over deaths, was 11.01; again a decided increase on 1892. Deaths and Death-rate. The number of deaths registered was 601, of which 284 were males and 317 females, slightly fewer than in 1892 when the number was 611. The death-rate was 13.19, and less than that of the three preceding years. Of these deaths 17 were of nonparishioners ocurring in the British Home for Incurables and the Home for the Dying, leaving 584 as the deaths of parishioners, which gives a death rate of 12.8 117 Table I. gives a comparison of these rates with those of the last ten years:— TABLE I.

Totals 110 72 68 16 92 32 60 50 30 121 Adding these 140 deaths to those enumerated in Table II., and substracting those above-mentioned as not belonging to Clapham, we get a total of 724 deaths, giving a death-rate of 15.8 per thousand. The corresponding rate for last year was 15.58. This is as correct a deathrate as we have the means of arriving at. Ages at Death. The proportion of the deaths at the different age groups to the total deaths was as follows:— Under 5 years 39.6 per cent. From 5 to 65 years 38.1 Above 65 years 22.3 „ The Infantile death-rate was 146 per thousand; that is the number of deaths of infants under 1 year of age per thousand living at that age. This is a slightly higher figure than in 1892 when the rate was 143. Social Position. The proportion in the various social grades was as follows:— Nobility and Gentry 4.8 per cent. Professional Classes 7.0 „ Middle and Trading Classes 25.1 „ Industrial and Labouring Classes 63.1 „ Zymotic Mortality and Sickness.

One patient died of confluent c 2 124 smallpox, and it was doubtful whether successful vaccination had ever been performed. The following arc some particulars of the cases. A. S. G., female, aged 25, vaccination doubtful, notified May 3rd. Husband was a School Board Attendance Officer and there had been a number of cases of small pox in the district where he had been visiting. This patient died. J. C. B., engine driver, vaccinated. Notified to be suffering from small pox on May 29th. Patient had slept, in the course of his work, at Salisbury and Southampton, and at both places there were a number of cases of the disease. It is supposed that he contracted the disease in that way. A. M. C., female, 52, vaccinated. Notified June 1st. Was visiting in London, and had been going about sight seeing, using omnibuses and other public vehicles. A. S., female, vaccinated, aged 19, notified June 29th. Domestic servant at a shop. Source of infection could not be traced. E. F. R., female, aged 39, vaccinated, notified August 11th. Source of infection could not be traced. The patient had not been more than a few hundred yards from her house for several weeks, and her husband (the following case) had been away from work for some months from illness. J. R. male, aged 47. Notified August 30. Vaccinated. Husband of E. F. R. It is satisfactory that, excepting in the last two eases, the precautions adopted were sufficient as far as we can tell to prevent further spread of the disease. 125 tion (which however was not in many instances submitted to) was urged on all persons who had not recently been vaccinated, and the rooms, clothing, &c., were thoroughly disinfected. Scarlet Fever.—The deaths were 22—17 at hospital and 5 at their own homes. 156 cases were removed to hospital out of a total of 303, or 51.4 per cent. The case mortality of those removed was 10.9 per cent., and of those remaining at home 3.4 per cent. These figures are higher than in 1892, showing that the type of scarlet fever occurring was more severe. The somewhat extensive prevalence of scarlet fever during the year was undoubtedly aggravated by the insufficiency of the hospital accommodation provided for the isolation of the cases. From the middle of June till the opening of the new Fountain Hospital, at Tooting, on October 30th, there Avas delay in getting urgent cases removed, and even after that date our difficulties had not entirely ceased. There is no doubt, also, that the hospitals are being used more largely, year by year, by classes of persons who find them convenient and economical, but who occupy houses where cases of scarlet fever could be nursed without danger to the public health. They, of course, occupy beds on which the very poor class should have the first claim. I think it would be a gain if sanitary authorities could have the power of selecting the cases that should be first removed when there is not room for all in the hospitals. The present system is removal according to priority of application, from whomever the application comes, and it has sometimes happened that cases that were a great source of danger have had to wait for days, until those others not so urgent have been removed. Diphtheria.—Thirty-one deaths were recorded, 17 at 126 the hospitals and 14 at their homes. Altogether 108 cases occurred, nearly twice as many as in last year. The case mortality was 28.7 per cent.; 41 were removed to hospital, so that the mortality of those removed was 41.4 per cent., and of those remaining at home 20.8 per cent. The houses where these cases occurred were all carefully inspected, and the drains tested, and in forty-seven instances more or less serious defects were found. In considerably more than half, however, no fault could be found with the houses as to dampness or drainage nuisances. One fact, however, becomes obvious in looking at the ages of the sufferers. Very nearly all were of school age, very few indeed were under three years of age, and very few over 15. I think, therefore, that schools are responsible for spreading diphtheria from pupil to pupil to a far greater extent than is generally supposed. It is most important for parents to recognise the great infectiousness of this terrible complaint, and also that the duration of the infection is longer than the obviously diseased condition of the throat. The large proportion that the deaths bear to the cases of illness—28.7 per cent., lends additional weight to the opinion that a large number of mild cases are not recognised as being diphtheria, and are therefore not notified, and probably attend school with only an absence of a day or two. It is certainly often an extremely difficult question for a medical man to decide whether a mild case is one of diphtheria or not, and among the poorer classes a doctor is not generally called in unless the child is obviously very ill. It appears to me that the greatest help could be given by the managers and teachers of elementary schools by insisting on the exclusion of any child suffering from any sort of sore throat, and not under any circumstances allowing 127 admission without the production of a certificate from a medical man that there is no danger of infection. Another point worthy of attention is the relationship that exists between diphtheria and scarlet fever, so that it has frequently been noticeable that an epidemic of the former has accompanied or quickly succeeded one of the latter. Membranous Croup need not here be distinguished from diphtheria. Six cases were notified and there were 2 deaths. In 2 of the houses where they occurred sanitary defects of a serious character were found. Enteric Fever.—There were 31 cases reported during the year, with 7 deaths, the same number as last year. In 18 of the houses where these cases occurred defects of a serious nature were found. There were also 2 cases of continued fever reported. Puerperal Fever.—Seven cases were reported, and there were 3 deaths. Serious drainage defects were found in 3 of the houses. Erysipelas.—Eighty-four cases were notified, and 4 deaths were ascribed to this cause. It is difficult to see what advantage results from the requirement of notification of these cases. Measles.—Twenty-seven deaths were referred to this disease, though last year there was no unusual prevalence of it. No doubt its spread could be very largely controled if all children in a house infected with measles could be excluded from school. Without information of the cases of course nothing can be done in this direction, and if this were the only advantage obtained by adding this disease to those in which notification is required, 128 I think it would be well worth the expense. Great pressure has, to my knowledge, been put on parents to send their children to school, even though there has been a case of measles in the house, by teachers in elementary schools, sometimes no doubt in ignorance of the existence of measles in that particular house. Whooping Cough caused 17 deaths. In this disease again no attempts are made to check its spread. Diarrhoea.—Twenty-five deaths were due to this cause. They were considerably above the decennial average, as was to be expected in so hot a summer as was experienced last year. There have not been so large a number of deaths from this cause since the year 1887, when the summer was unusually hot. 129 Table TABLE OF POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, ( B ) coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, during the year 1893, in the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Clapham; classified according to Diseases, Ages, and Localities.

Note 1.—The present Table B. is concerned with population, births, and sickness (not with mortality) in the Sanitary district or division to which the Table relates. 130 Cholera,—During the summer months considerable dread was felt lest this disease should become epidemic in this country. Though a number of cases were imported into London, and in September four cases were reported in Westminster, Fulham, Lambeth, and Southwark, all of which died, no case was reported in Clapham. A great deal of attention was given, however, to prepare for a possible outbreak. In addition to arrangements with medical men to attend cases of diarrhoea and cholera should it have become epidemic, an arrangement common to the whole Wandsworth District, plans were prepared by the Surveyor, in consulation with myself, for a wooden hospital in the parish yard to hold 32 patients. This could have been got ready for occupation in a fortnight or less had there been unfortunately any occasion for it. By the Metropolitan Asylums Board, ambulances and bearers were arranged to be provided at the Relief Station, Bromell's Road, and the Parish Yard, Wandsworth Road. I received 24 notices from the Medical Officers of Health of Port Sanitary Authorities relating to persons coming from infected foreign ports to addresses in Clapham. The houses were visited, but no illness of a suspicious character was heard of. Deaths from Non-zymotic Diseases. The appended Table gives the number of deaths from the various causes for the last 10 years, and the last columns show whether those for 1893 were above or below the decennial average corrected for increase of population. 131 TABLE VI. 1883 18S4 1885 1886 1887 1888 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 Number above corrected decennia average.

It is seen that the deaths from all the principal classes of disease were below the decennial average, with the exception of those under the head of Premature Birth, Low Vitality, &c., which exceeded the average by six, and those under the head of Urinary Diseases. It is particularly satisfactory to notice the decrease in deaths from tubercular diseases (which includes consumption), as they are infective diseases, and their spread is favoured by overcrowding and other insanitary conditions. The number of deaths from tubercular diseases may be taken as an indication of the sanitary state of a locality. 132 Inquests. There have been 32 inquests held during the year, the following being the verdicts:— Males. Females, , Total. Natural Causes 6 10 – – 16 Accidental Burns 1 1 Falls 3 1 Drowning 1 Blood Poisoning from Cat Bite 1 – – 8 Suicide Poisoning with Oxalic Acid 1 Revolver wound.. 1 Wilful Murder Exposure – 2 2 Injuries to Vessels of Throat – 1 – 3 Open Verdicts Hæmarrhage 1 Suffocation 2 – – 3 – 32 In addition 9 deaths were registered on the authority of the Coroner, without an inquest having been held. Vaccination.—The Table on page 24 gives information of the amount of vaccination performed. It will be seen that 88 children by removal or other causes escaped vaccination. Disinfection.—558 rooms in 445 houses have been fumigated with sulphurous acid gas by this department, and in 17 houses the disinfection has been carried out under the supervision of the medical man in attendance and certified by him. 374 lots of bedding, clothing, &c., have been disinfected by super-heated steam by the contractor, and two lots of bedding have been burnt. 133 371 notices were served to strip walls and cleanse 412 rooms, and in some instances the work has had to be done by the Board's servants. One public cab and one van were disinfected after being used to remove infected persons. Unsound Food.—Three trunks of fish and two parcels of fruit were destroyed by order of the magistrate, and in the case of the fruit, the tradesman was fined £5 and costs for exposing it for sale when unsound. Underground Rooms.—During the year 25 underground rooms "separately occupied" were regularly inspected. During the last inspection however 15 of these were found to have become no longer so occupied. As I have remarked in a former report, the conditions of tenancy alter so frequently in this class of weekly property, that it is impossible to know from week to week when underground rooms are occupied separately. Four underground rooms were altered to bring them into conformity with the Act. Workshops.—106 were inspected and were found generally satisfactory. Seven required cleansing and lime-washing, and in two there was insufficient watercloset accommodation. In the latter 4 new water-closets and 2 new urinals were provided. Out-workers.—It will be remembered that in 1892 the Home Secretary made an order under the Factory and Workshop Acts, 1678-1891, requiring the occupiers of factories and workshops where the following kinds of work was carried on, viz., the manufacture of articles of wearing apparel, the manufacture of electro-plate, cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work, and the manufacture of files, to keep lists of 134 out-workers and their addresses to be open to the inspection of any Officer of a Sanitary Authority, with the view of inspection being made of the homes to which these employes carried home their work. In the last annual report doubt was expressed as to whether any good results would follow, on account of the wide distribution throughout London of out-workers in connection with any particular place of business. Not as much work has been done during the year as could have been wished, owing to other demands on the time of the inspectors being so great. However, 11 lists have been inspected at various factories and workshops, and it was found that the great majority of the addresses of outworkers were not in this parish. They were accordingly sent to the various Sanitary Authorities in whose districts they were situated. During the year only one address of an out-worker has been received here from another Sanitary Authority. So that the net result of the considerable amount of work done, has been the inspection of some two or three houses to which work was taken home, and the supplying of a great deal of information to other Sanitary Authorities; a very onesided and unsatisfactory result as far as this parish is concerned. Smoke Consumption.—The enforcement of the law in regard to smoke nuisances from the chimneys of factories is, since 1892, the duty of the Sanitary Authorities. On six occasions notices have been served to abate nuisances of this kind. They have been so far complied with that no further action lias been necessary. The cow-houses and slaughter-houses were inspected in September. The bake-houses were inspected twice during the year. 135 Lime-whiting was required in 3 instances in May, and in 12 in October. General Sanitary Proceedings. During the year 4,725 houses and premises were inspected, and the total number of nuisances dealt with amounted to 6,429, of these 5,663 were abated under notice and 761 without; 2,465 notices were served, viz.: 2,220 preliminary and 245 Statutory. The Table on page 113 gives a statement of the nuisances dealt with that can be conveniently classified. In addition 1,374 nuisances were dealt with besides those in the Table, and the following were some of the works executed to remedy them:—459 water-closets disconnected from drinking-water cisterns and a separate supply laid on, 191 water-closet apparatuses renewed, 125 soil-pipes renewed, 34 soil-pipes repaired, 160 soil-pipes ventilated, 12 defective ventilating pipes repaired, 10 water-closet apartments ventilated, 48 floors repaired, 29 walls repaired, 3 areas lowered below floor level, 2 wash-houses rebuilt, 3 windows repaired, 49 leaky water fittings repaired, 7 bath and lavatory waste-pipes repaired, 12 leaky sinks repaired, 29 waste-pipes repaired, 10 stable yards paved, 7 workshops cleansed, 2 water supplies laid on to factories, 15 new manure receptacles constructed, 2 privies cleansed, 2 sinks replaced with new ones, 2 new slop sinks fixed, and 5 cisterns replaced. Other nuisances were as follows:—18 damp houses, 31 dilapidated houses, 15 cases of water in basements, 7 cases of surface water, 4 cases of stagnant water, 2 cases of burning refuse, 6 smoke nuisances, foul bedding, 2 cases of rats, 2 cases of dead bodies of animals, and animals kept so as to be a nuisance— pigs, 4 instances; rabbits, 3; dogs, 1; fowls, 3; and pigeons, 1. The drains of 389 houses and premises have been 136 reconstructed, 380 inspection chambers have been built, and 650 new ventilating pipes fixed, and of these, 83 new drains, 95 inspection chambers, and 124 ventilating pipes were constructed without notices, the owners at once recognising the necessity of the work. Magisterial Proceedings. Seventeen summonses were issued to enforce orders of the Board in connection with sanitary defects, and of these 12 were withdrawn, the necessary work having been carried out, and in the remaining 5 the magistrate made orders for the work to be done. A builder was fined 10s. with 23s. costs, under Section 42, Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for improperly laying a drain. Housing of the Working Classes Act, I890. In 31 instances premises were found to be in so bad a state that it appeared desirable to proceed under Part II. of this Act. They were as follows:— Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, Clark's Cottages, Lower Orchard Street.—Closed on service of notices. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, Lyles' Cottages, Lower Orchard Street.— Thoroughly cleansed and repaired on service of notices. Nos. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33, White Square.—Closed by order of the Magistrate, the notices to render the buildings fit for habitation not having been complied with. Nos. 34, 34a, 35, 36, 37, and 38, White Square.— Thoroughly cleansed and repaired on service of notices. 137 A large amount of very important sanitary work has, therefore, been carried out during the year, and I must add a word of praise to the inspectors who have performed their duties with punctuality and tact and entirely to my satisfaction. OLIVER FIELD, M.D., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health for Clapham. i) 138 PUTNEY & ROEHAMPTON. I estimate the population of Putney and Roehampton for the year 1893 at 18,092, and this will be taken as the basis of calculation in the various Tables which follow. Birth and Death Rates. During the year 462 births were registered, which gives us a birth-rate of 24.7 per 1,000. This is slightly above the average for the last ten years. Two hundred and fifty-six deaths were registered, which gives a death-rate for the twelve months of 13'6. This is the highest death-rate we have had for the last nine years. TABLE I.

This number is slightly below that recorded during the previous year. If these deaths are added to those which occurred within the district, it gives a total of 299, and a death-rate of 15'9 per 1,000 per annum. TABLE II. Deaths in Outlying Institutions. DISEASES.

I have classified all the deaths occuring in this sub-district, according to their cause, under the different headings of sex, age, and social position. n 2 140 Ages at Death.—The proportion of deaths at different ages is as follows:— Under 1 year 22.2 per cent. From 1 to 5 years 15.6 „ From 5 to 65 years 38.3 „ Over 65 years 23.9 „ The proportion of deaths among children under 5 years is about equal to that occurring during the subsequent sixty years of life. Infantile Mortality.—I am pleased to report that during the year the death rate of infants has been much below the average. Hitherto in this sub-district the infantile mortality has been very high. In the previous year there were 163 deaths of infants under twelve months for every 1,000 births. During 1893, however, there were only 123, which is much below the average for London generally. 141 TABLE III. STATISTICS OF MORTALITY. PUTNEY.

This is a higher rate than we have had during the last ten years. The two points of unusual importance in the Table are the large number of deaths from influenza and diphtheria. If we exclude the deaths from the former we have a death-rate of 2.1. In connection with Zymotic Diseases to arrive at a correct death-rate, it is necessary to include the deaths occurring in hospital of residents in this district. These institutions are being taken advantage of to a much larger extent than in past years. On reference to Table II. it will be found that fourteen deaths occurred from Zymotic Diseases in hospital outside our area. If these twelve be added to the fifty which were registered in this sub-district, it gives a total Zymotic death-rate of 3.4 per 1,000 per annum.

Both cases occurred in the same house in Roehampton village, the victims being a mother and daughter. The latter was the first attacked. She evidently had caught the infection while visiting friends in London. The disease had made considerable progress before a medical man was called in. Immediately after notification the patient was removed to hospital, the room disinfected and the bedding burned. Vaccination was urged on the mother, who had been nursing her daughter, but it was not carried out. In about a week after the daughter's removal to hospital the mother was attacked and sent away likewise, the same precautions being taken as after the first case. So far theRe has been no recurrence of the disease in the parish. Influenza.—Ten deaths were registered as being attributed to influenza. In all these cases, however, the immediate cause of death was some complications generally in connection with the lungs. Scarlet Fever.—107 notifications were received of this disease, with five deaths. Forty-four of these cases were removed to hospital. We had, therefore, in this parish a serious invasion of this disease. Although forty-four of these cases were removed to hospital, it is right to add that in many instances their removal was delayed as long as ten or twelve days on account of want of accommodation at the Asylums Board hospitals. I attribute, to some extent, the prevalence of the epidemic within our district to this delay. The proper isolation of most of these patients at their own homes was a mere impossibility. Since the opening of the hospital at Tooting, however, the removal of all our infectious cases has been effected very promptly. 147 Diphtheria.—During the year there were 69 eases of diphtheria notified to me. Fourteen cases were removed to hospital. Fourteen deaths from this disease were registered in the sub-district, and nine deaths of residents of the parish occurred in hospitals outside of our boundary. During the past twelve years we have had a wonderful immunity from this disease. Since 1888 there has not been a single death from diphtheria registered in this sub-district. Up till the month of June this year, although several scattered cases occurred throughout the parish they were of the ordinary mild type to which we have become accustomed. In the month of June one case occurred in Olivette Street, and another in Mascotte Road, both infants, and both followed by a fatal result. In the month of July two more cases occurred in Olivette Street, one in Lifford Street, and one in North Place. In the month of August 17 cases of diphtheria were notified; 13 of these were confined to a very small area—practically to a few streets in the vicinity of Olivette Street and Mascotte Road. In the month of September four cases were notified more widely scattered throughout the district—in October five—in November 17, and in December eight. The distribution of the epidemic is certainly suggestive. Of the 69 cases notified, no less than 44 occurred in a comparatively small area bounded by the High Street and Charlwood Road to the east and west, and Upper Richmond and Lower Richmond Road to the south and north. Charlwood Road, Redgrove Road, Mascotte Road, Olivette Road, and Gay Street were most affected. A sanitary inspection was made by myself to determine, if possible, the cause of the epidemic. This neighbourhood is the most densely populated part of our district, and the 148 streets swarm with children. The sewers are ventilated by shafts opening on the road level in the centre of the carriage way. Over the opening of these shafts the children congregate and inhale any noxious gases which escape. In Gwalior Road a gully man-hole at the side of the foothpath was found to have its water seal broken and communicated direct with the sewer. The occupants of the neighbouring houses complained of very offensive smells arising from this grating. On testing the drains of the nearest house the fumes from the drain tester were strongly smelt arising from this gully. The water supply of the houses in Gwalior Road, was found to be defective. The general plan adopted was the following:- One cistern was used, divided in the centre by a partition and covered over by a common lid. One half of the cistern contained the water which supplied the watercloset. The other half supplied water for drinking purposes. The connection between the cistern and w.c. was effected by means of a lever and plug arrangement as formerly used in the old pan closets. The result of this method was that every time the w.c. was flushed out an escape of gas bubbled up from it through the water in the cistern.. The foul air was prevented from escaping by the lid cover and got gradually reabsorbed by the drinking water. As the result of my inquiries, however, in regard to all the cases notified, I was compelled to come to the conclusion that, after making allowance for the injurious results of these sanitary defects, the majority of the cases were due to personal infection. I was confident that there were cases of children suffering from mild diphtheria, in regard to whom no precautions were taken, and for whom no medical aid was called in. The infection was either spread from one to another during school hours or while playing together in the streets. 149 The measures taken to arrest the epidemic were the following:— 1. All sanitary defects were put right. 2. The street sewers were flushed more thoroughly and frequently. <3. I sent a notice to all School Teachers directing them to watch any children apparently suffering from sore throat, and if they found any thus affected to send them home until they were able to produce a doctor's certificate that they were not suffering from an infectious throat. This latter precaution I consider most important. The fact that diphtheria has been gradually increasing in the Metropolis in spite of our improved sanitary conditions, appears to me to he a strong argument for the belief that the crowding together and the close intercourse of very young children in our public schools, is one of the main factors in the extension of the disease. Typhoid Fever.—I have had-eight cases of this disease notified to me as compared with 12 during the preceding year. One case was removed to hospital Two of the cases proved fatal. Cholera.—During the summer and autumn of last year there was great apprehension of an outbreak of cholera but which was never realised. All necessary precautions however Avere taken in order to be prepared for the epidemic should the occasion have unfortunately arisen. A site was obtained for the ercction of a temporary cholera hospital. Enquiries were made as to how many medical men in the district would be prepared to attend cases of cholera and choleraic diarrhoea if called upon by the Sanitary Authority to do so, at a fixed rate of remuneration. An Ambulance Station was to be fitted up by the Asylums Board at the Police Station in the Upper Richmond Road. The question as to the provision of refuges for the healthy occupants of infected houses was not 150 touched. The danger was not considered so imminent as to require the authority to take steps to secure shelters. The parish has however provided a very comfortable shelter at the New Wharf Buildings as required under The Public Health Act. This has already been used for housing a family turned out of their own home for the purpose of disinfection. Such a provision of course would not be adequate during the prevalence of a wide spread epidemic of cholera. If such a contingency should arise the authority might probably be able to secure some unoccupied houses for the purpose of shelters. In any case a sufficient warning would be given to enable the authority to take steps to secure the required accommodation. Non-Zymotic Mortality.—There were fewer deaths arising from these causes than during the previous year. There was a diminution in the number resulting from cancer and other tumours, contrary to what has been the case for some years. Inquests and Verdicts.—The following is a list in tabular form of the various inquests held in the Sub-district during 1893:— I. From Natural Causes.—Infantile Convulsions 1 II. Accidental.— Suffocation in bed 1 Want of attention at birth 2 Drowning 1 Poisoning 1—5 III. Open Verdict.-—Found drowned 1 IV.. Homicidal.—Htcmorrhage from wound in throat 1 V. Suicidal.— Poisoning 1 Drowning1—2 10 The number of inquests was considerably less than the average. 151 There were no deaths uncertified by medical men on which no inquests were held. Sanitary Work.—A list of the various sanitary operations will be found in the general summary. A large amount of useful work has been again accomplished. There were 3,363 houses and premises inspected, which was very nearly the same number as in the previous year. I should like to point out the extreme value of this work of regular house to house inspection. The order of the Board is that all property at or below a rental value of £40 per annum should be inspected. By no other possible way could we be able to prevent nuisances and sanitary defects arising. The fact that 873 notices had to be served to abate nuisances is sufficient proof that this regular routine work is still required as much as ever. Only four cases were investigated by the magistrate and in these compulsory orders were obtained and the work executed. The number of houses in which disinfection had to bo carried out after infectious diseases was 122. This was more than double the number during the previous twelve months, and is accounted for by the epidemics of scarlet fever and diphtheria from which we suffered. There were 85 cases where bedding had to be stoved, which was also much in excess of the previous year. This is the most expensive part of the work of disinfection, and is only resorted to in those cases of infectious disease where it is absolutely essential. Factory and Workshop Act.—Under this Act the workshops in this district are placed under the control of the Sanitary Authority in regard to matters affecting their cleanliness, overcrowding, and general sanitary arrangements. During the year they have all been inspected and found in a satisfactory condition, with the exception of one case of overcrowding, and one case where lime-washing 152 was required. In both of these the necessary notice was served, and the defects remedied. The order of the Secretary of State, dated October 31st, 1892, under the Factory and Workshop Acts in regard to out-workers in certain occupations was put in force in this sub-district during the year. It has been so far of no practical utility to us. A notice was served on all the occupiers of the factories and workshops referred to, requiring them to keep lists of their out-workers which should be open to inspection at any time. During the year a list of these out-workers was drawn up twice, and as directed by the Board, notices were forwarded to the various Sanitary Authorities of the districts where these workers resided. These lists may possibly have been of some use to these authorities. In our own parish however we have received no lists from outside districts of any out-workers residing within our boundaries. For all practical purposes therefore the order is a dead letter, so far as we are concerned. To carry it out efficiently, all lists should be sent to a central authority at regular periods, and it would be their duty to make abstracts of these lists and send them to the various sanitary districts concerned. The bake-houses were inspected as usual twice during the year and the necessary lime-whiting carried out. They were all found to be in a satisfactory condition. There has lately been a great attack on and a so-called exposure of the insanitary condition of London bake-houses. To judge from some of the reports lately published, the public would be made to believe that London bake-houses are sinks of sanitary iniquities, in which all kinds of horrors are allowed to pass unnoticed. A cry for fresh and more stringent legislation has been raised in regard to these places. It appears to me, so far as I can judge from my own district, there is a great deal of the alarmist 153 element in this outcry. Bake-houses must always be in the nature of things, to a certain extent, unhealthy. If there are however any insanitary conditions present which are capable of removal, we have ample power under the Public Health Act and the bye-laws framed by the County Council, to effect it without the necessity of further legislation. Under the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, for the purpose of relieving a certain class of property of the Inhabited House Duty Tax, I was called upon to examine some houses in Roskell Terrace. These houses are built in flats, and each flat is a separate tenement with separato saintary conveniences. I was satisfied with these arrangements and was thus able to give a certificate for exemption from this tax. In the list of sanitary operations undertaken throughout the year there are 377 unclassified nuisances. This list includes the following:— 34 to provide a separate water supply for drinking purposes. 64 to repair soil pipe. 44 to repair ventilating pipe. 7 to provide proper receptacles for manure. 8 to repair water pipe. 2 to provide watercloset accommodation. 85 to repair dust-bins. 28 to trap waste pipe of sink. 7 to discontinue keeping animals so as to be a nuisance. 1 privy abolished. I have inspected, as usual, all cow-houses and slaughterhouses in the sub-district. They were found to be in a satisfactory condition. E 154 In my last report I referred to the condition of overcrowding at the Charlwood Road National Schools. Since that time additional school accommodation has been provided at Putney Lower Common, so that the overcrowding no longer exists. All sanitary conveniences have been erected in connection with this new school on approved modern principles. I have once more to express my thanks to all those associated with myself in carrying out the sanitary work of the parish, and to the members of the Putney Committee for the assistance and support they have at all times so freely given to me. Wm. Y. ORE, M.B., C.M., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health for Putney and Roehampton, 155 streatham. In presenting my Annual Summary for the year 1893, I have the pleasure to announce that notwithstanding the large amount of infectious disease, and the especially extensive epidemic of Scarlet Fever which prevailed during the year, the death-rate, corrected for institutions, was below the decennial average, and the zymotic mortality below that of last year. The birth-rate is higher than it has been for some years. The following statistics obtained in the usual manner from the Registrar General's Returns and the local records of sickness and mortality will corroborate these remarks and also give interesting information in respect of the public health and sanitary condition of this district. Population. The population of this district estimated for the year 1893 is 47,012 persons, but probably this estimate is below the correct figure, having regard to the large amount of building being carried on. Births and Birth Rate. The number of births registered during the year was 1,206, 620 of males and 586 of females. The birth-rate calculated from the number of births and the foregoing estimate of population, was 25.6 per 1,000 persons living during the year. This is higher than it has been for several years. e 2 156 Natural Increase. The excess of births over deaths was 619, 309 of males and 310 of females, giving a rate of 13.2 per 1000 of the population. Peaths and Peath Hate. During the year, 587 deaths were registered in tne parish, of which 311 were of males, and 276 of females, giving a death-rate of 12.4 per 1000. To arrive at the actual number of deaths of parishioners both within and without the district, the total number of deaths of non-parishioners must be excluded from the calculation and the deaths of parishioners outside the district, in Metropolitan Institutions, &c, (for details refer to Table II), must be included, representing a total of 612, and giving the correct death-rate of parishioners as 13.0 per 1000 of the population. The death-rate, although apparently higher than that of previous years is accountable to the hitherto different method of calculation from that already described. The statistics of former years give the death-rates of parishioners within the parish, not accounting for those dying in outside institutions. The death-rate for the year upon that method of calculation would be 11.7 per 1000, far below the death-rate for London. Table I. gives the number of births and deaths, birthrates and death-rates, and rates of natural increase during the past ten years. 157 TABLE 1. Birth and Death Rates. YEARS. Births. Brth-rates.

Zymotic Diseases, their prevalence and fatality. There were 82 deaths in this class, including 10 from influenza, which is much lower than in the last two years). They yield a percentage of 14.3 upon the deaths from all causes. The seven principal diseases in this class give a death-rate of 0.6 per 1,000 of the population. The annexed table contrasts all the deaths resulting from epidemic diseases with the death-rates therefrom, as well as those from all diseases during the past ten years. 163 TABLE IV.

Owing to efficient vaccination, prompt isolation and disinfection, the scope of the disease was limited and finally arrested, and it is interesting to note that none of the cases proved fatal. On the 1st of May, the first cases came to my notice, being those of Mr. and Mrs.-of Danbrook Road, Streatham. The husband was then in the third day of eruption and the wife convalescent, she having been taken ill a fortnight previously. I at once had the whole of the occupants of the house vaccinated and by concerted arrangements with the Surveyor, the household was kept in quarantine—our action being subsequently approved by the Board. The son and another inmate of the house were the next to develop the disease; all were promptly removed to hospital, and the premises disinfected. Mrs. - had previously visited a friend at Battersea who had recovered from the disease, and this is evidently the source of infection. The case of Mr.- of Larch Road was notified on the 9th July, he was immediately removed to hospital, the premises disinfected, and the whole of the occupants vaccinated. This person had also previously visited a relative at Battersea who was convalescent from the disease. The case of -an infant, of Cheriton Square, was reported on the 8th November, and two further cases subsequently occurred in the same house. The source of infection was not traceable. 165 In the remaining cases, wherever any evidence could be obtained, it was found to have been contracted from outside the district. In every case the patients were removed to hospital, and immediate steps taken to prevent the spread of the disease. The whole of the Sanitary Staff were, together with their families, successfully vaccinated before exposing themselves to infection, and happily escaped the disease. Measles. Except in the year 1888, never during the last decade has the number of deaths from Measles been so low. There were but two deaths due to this disease during the year. Scarlet Fever. Here as in the rest of London, the epidemic of Scarlet Fever which began in 1892 increased in intensity during the year. The disease was however of a very mild type, and the mortality resulting therefrom was exceedingly low, only three deaths occurring in the 313 cases notified, two of which were at the homes of the patients and one in the hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, being 0.51 per cent, of the total deaths or 0.6 per cent, of the total number of cases notified. The present system of notification and isolation has I believe much to do with this slight mortality. In other days mild epidemics of Scarlet Fever were often followed by a large mortality from the sequelae of the disease, which is now greatly obviated by the care and precaution resulting from enforced isolation. This epidemic has cast a large amount of extra work upon the Sanitary Department. 166 Fifty-three per cent., more than one-half of the cases were removed to hospital. Diphtheria. Thirteen deaths occurred from diphtheria, five at their homes and eight in Asylums Board and other Hospitals. Sixty-five cases were notified during the year, of which thirty-two were removed to hospital. Typhoid Fever. Of the twenty-three cases notified from this disease, three proved fatal, all of which were at their own homes. Eight patients were removed to hospital. The percentage of deaths was below the previous vear. In cases of notifiable infectious disease the water supply and sanitary condition of the houses were carefully investigated and all defects remedied; in this way a large amount of good sanitary work has been effected. Whooping Cough. Whooping Cough accounted for 16 deaths, 15 of which occurred at their homes and 1 at hospital. There was no excess at any particular period of the year. Diarrhoea. Diarrhoea caused 35 deaths (34 at their homes and 1 at hospital) of which 26 occurred during the months of July and August. This was probably due to the high temperature of the summer months. It was chiefly prevalent amongst children uuder one 167 year of age of the industrial and labouring classes, and evidently accentuated by defective feeding. Cholera. Although some cases of Cholera have occurred in London and elsewhere, this much dreaded disease did not become epidemic. The Streatham Local Committee took every means to meet it should it appear in the locality. A site was obtained, hospital tents provided, and other arrangements made. Eortunately, however, these have not been needed up to the present time, but certainly all the care and attention has not been illdirected. All danger of invasion is not yet over and precautions should be continued. TABLE V. The following table gives the number of notified diseases, the number of cases removed to Hospital, and the number of deaths that took place, in both the Sub-district and the Hospital. DISEASES.

The deaths from respiratory diseases contributed 117 deaths to the total mortality. Respiratory diseases were accountable for one-fifth of the total mortality. 169 There was considerable decrease in the deaths from, cancer and also in deaths from tubercular diseases, and compared with past years they were very much below the average. Ages at Death. Infant Mortality. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age, was 150; under five, 193; and under twenty-five, 233. They respectively formed 25.5, 32.8, and 397 per cent. of all deaths. There was an increase of 2.6 per cent. in the proportion of deaths of infants under one year, and a decrease of 1 per cent. of the deaths of children under five years of age. Senile Decay. There were 54 deaths from old ago unassociated with disease. Of these, 27 were of males, and 27 of females; they yield a percentage of 8.8 on all deaths. The total number of deaths at 65 and upwards was 177. Of these, 132 were over 70; 46 were 80 and upwards. Below is a statement in tabular form of deaths at high ages, with the age at different, periods, and the sex of the deceased. They formed 225 per cent. of all deaths. TABLE VII. Age. Males. Females.

The figures relating to the sickness and mortality of the parish poor, are given in Table VII. on the previous page. In the zymotic class, there were cases of Measles, Diphtheria,Whooping Cough, Diarrhœa, Erysipelas, Scarlet Fever, Puerperal Eever and Influenza. In the other classes, as usual, respiratory diseases contributed a large proportion of the cases under treatment. The heading "Other Diseases," in the Table, includes diseases of the nervous and digestive systems, as well as other local and constitutional disorders, under which, came a very large proportion of the cases treated. The total mortality was lower than that of the previous year. Inquests. Seventeen inquests were held, thirteen upon males and four upon females, with the following verdicts:— I. Natural Premature Birth .. 1 Heart Disease .. 1 Syncope .. 2—1 II. Violence:— (a) Accidental Suffocation 4 Knocked down by Trains 2 Perforation of Stomach 1 Drowned 1—8 (b.) Suicide Poisoning 2 Cut Throat Hanging 1 1 Drowning 1—5 —13 17 Uncertified Deaths. Twelve cases of sudden death were submitted to the Coroner in which inquests were deemed unnecessary. Three were of males and nine of females. f 2 172 The causes of death were as follows:— Heart Disease 1 Syncope 2 Convulsions 2 Diarrhoea 2 Bronchitis 3 Premature Birth 1 Pneumonia 1 12 Particulars of the Sanitary operations of the year are given in Table XIII. of the combined Report. The number of house to house inspections was 1121, this is below the average of systematic house to house inspection, and is to be accounted for in the circumstances that the Inspectors have to devote a very great part of their time to the water testing of new drains in accordance with the recent regulations of the Board, which make it encumbent upon builders to have the drains so tested before being covered in; 3690 such drain inspections were made, the water test being applied in 1798 cases. The number of drains tested in old houses was 368. First notices were served in 867 instances to remedy defects and abate nuisances (an increase of 179 upon the previous year), for which only 33 statutory notices were required to be served. Many unclassified works have been executed voluntarily by the owners and occupiers of houses. 414 rooms and. one cab have been disinfected after infectious disease, the agency being sulphur. In 155 instances the bedding was stoved. 173 376 syphon traps Lave been fixed, and 523 water closets cleansed, repaired, or had water laid on. The Table gives further details, and an examination will show the stride sanitation is making in the District. Bakehouses. The necessary limewhiting and cleansing of bakehouses throughout the parish have been regularly carried out and the same duly inspected. Wells. Samples of the water from all the known wells have been analysed during the year, and in consequence of the polluted condition of the water, the wells have in some cases been voluntarily closed. In other cases proceedings are to be taken with a view to enforcing such closure. The Company's water supply has been laid on to all the houses supplied by these wells. Two of the wells in question have been held in high estimation by the surrounding inhabitants, and many have come from long distances to partake of the cool and sparkling water. In the one case the water was much polluted and the other was of questionable character, and a further sample is to be taken shortly. Diseased Meat. On the evening of the 3rd October, Inspector .brown brought me some lambs plucks for examination, having obtained them from a butcher, believing the lungs to be tubercular. The lungs were covered with pale looking elevations, which when cut into were found to be cystic in character, the contents under the microscope proved to be crowded with the entozoa of the strongylus filaria. The symptoms of this parasitic disease are well known 174 to farmers, and animals upon its detection are at once slaughtered to save their carcases, which in the early stage of the disease are not unfit for human food. I instructed the Inspector that the lungs were unfit for human food, and they were taken before the Magistrate at the South-Western Police Court who condemned and ordered their destruction, which was subsequently carricd out. The offender was dealt with leniently by the Board, but cautioned as to bis future conduct. Slaughterhouses. During the year the whole of the cow-houses and slaughter-houses have been inspected and in all cases the licenses were renewed by the London County Council. Application was made in July last for a license for a new slaughter-house near Streatham Common, but the Board considering my report as to the unfit condition of the premises for such a purpose decided to oppose, and consequently the London County Council refused to grant the license. Police Court. The five cases investigated by Magistrates included in Table XIII. of the combined Report include summonses against (1) the Tramway Company for smoke nuisance, (2) a farmer for keeping animals in an unfit place, (3) a grocer for selling tinned rabbits unfit for human food, (1) a butcher for selling diseased sheep's pluck, (5) a cabman using his cab whilst the latter was infected, after having been cautioned by the Sanitary Inspector. M ortuary. The new Mortuary in the Parish Yard, High ] 75 Road, Streatham, fulfils a want of long standing. Many years ago I wroten a Report to the Board on the urgent need of a Mortuary on the score of health and decency, at that time the difficulty of site appeared to he insuperable and the matter was postponed. The present building was designed and built under the direction of Mr. Marten, the Surveyor; it is a substantial and handsome structure of its kind and very complete in detail, in view of the requirements of a largely augmented population in the future. I have to thank the Sanitary Staff for their attention and able assistance in all matters of sanitation. And my cordial thanks are due to the Streatham Local Committee for their invariable courtesy, and the support I have always received at their hands. F. P. SU IT ON, M.D., Medical Officcr of Health for Streatham. 176 TOOTING. The estimated population for the year 1893 is 5,306 and upon this calculation are based the various birth, death and other rates. Births and Birth Rate. During the year 213 births were registered, of which 101 were males and 112 females. The birth-rate is 401 per 1,000, being the highest rate recorded for some years. Deaths, Death Rate and Rate of Natural Increase. Exclusive of out-lying institutions, the number of deaths registered during the year was 112 (of which 56 were males and 50 females), giving a death-rate of 21.1 per 1,000. The total deaths of parishioners (obtained by excluding the deaths of non-parishioners within the district, from the calculation, and including those of parishioners outside the district) numbers 122, representing a death-rate of 22.9 per 1,000 of the population. The rate of natural increase was 19.0 per 1,000; the excess of births over deaths being 101. Table I. gives the number of births and deaths, birthrates and death-rates and rates of natural increase during the past years. 177 TABLE I. Birth and Death Rates. Tears. Births. Birth-Rates.

The death-rate is lower than the previous year, and the birth-rate higher, which may be considered favourable. The numerous sanitary operations of the year are included in Table XIII. of the combined Report and will repay perusal. C. de LISLE BROCK, Medical Officer of Health for Tooting. WANDSWORTH. Population. According to the method adopted by the Registrar General, the population of the sub-district in the middle of 1893 amounted to 52,422. In intercensal periods we have no certain method of checking this calculation, but for practical and comparative purposes, the above may be taken as approaching as near to the exact population as is possible by any purely calculative method. Births and Birth-rate. During the year 1,606 births were registered, 847 of males and 759 of females. This is 71 more than that of 1892, but is 110 less than the corrected average for the 10 years 1883-92. The birth-rate was 31.95 per 1,000, the lowest that has been recorded since 1880, and the rate of natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths, was 18.35 per 1,000. Deaths and Death-rate. The total number of deaths was 820, 445 of males and 375 of females, 18 less than last year, and 50 less than the corrected average for the preceding 10 years. 136 of the above deaths took place in the following public institutions viz.:—In the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum, 92 ; in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, 9 ; in the Prison, 7; and in St. Peter's Hospital, 8. The death-rate of the sub-district calculated from the above, was 15.63, without correction for the above Institutions, while with such correction it was 13.60 per 1,000. The following Table shows the number of births and deaths, birth-rates and death-rates, and rates of natural increase, as compared with those of the 10) preceding years. G 186 TABLE I.

To ascertain, however, the true mortality of the sub-district, the deaths of parishioners in out-lying institutions must also be included. The following Table shows the deaths which occurred in these out-lying institutions. The total number of deaths was 161, seven more than occurred in 1892. Of these 101 took place in the Union Infirmary, 27 in general and special Hospitals, and 33 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. 187 TABLE II. Deaths in Out-lying Institutions.

There is, however, one fallacy in this estimation, and that is, that in the estimate of the population, the parishioners belonging to Wandsworth resident in these outlying Institutions are not included. This number would bo exceedingly small and would only fractionally affect the above rate. Table III. gives the statistics of mortality in the sub-district for the year.

The total number of deaths from the above was 128, or nine less than the decennial average. The following table shows the total deaths from these diseases, and the proportion of these to deaths from all causes for the preceding 10 years, as compared with the year 1893. The zymotic death rate was 2.54 per 1,000, 1.2 per 1,000 below last year, and 112 per 1,000 below the corrected decennial average. If influenza, which only entered into these calculations in 1892, be excluded, the zymotic death-rate would only be 2.26 per 1,000. A correction has again to be made as the deaths from these diseases in out-lying institutions required to be added; the number who died in these institutions was 38, and this added to 128, gives a total of 166, giving a death rate of 3.3 per 1,000, or if influenza be excluded of 3.02 per 1,000. 193 TABLE IV.

No deaths resulted, and it is gratifying to note, that in no instance did the disease spread from any of these notified cases. All the persons affected were vaccinated in infancy. 194 TABLE V. D Age.

The official return of the Vaccination Officer shows that in the year 1892, of the 1/536 children whose births were registered, 1,204 were successfully vaccinated, 118 died unvaccinated, in 24 the vaccination was postponed, 8 were certified as insusceptible, 132 had removed, and only 50 remained on the books as unvaccinated. Measles. Judging by the number of deaths, viz.: 2, this disease was not prevalent during the year. This was 26'8 below the corrected decennial average, and 28 below last year. Searle Fever. This disease was very prevalent during the whole of 1893, but more especially in the months of June, July, 195 • September, October, and November. In all, 440 cases were notified as compared with 303 last year. 188 of these were removed to Hospital where 11 died, 252 were treated at home with 3 deaths, giving a total case mortality of 3.2 per cent. There is a very great difference in the case mortality of Hospital as compared with home-treated cases, the former being nearly 5.9 per cent., while the latter was only 1.18 per cent. This difference is to some extent due to the greater severity of the cases removed to Hospital. Diphtheria. 151 cases were notified, and 34 of these were removed to Hospital. Of the hospital cases 9 died or 26.4 per cent., while of the cases treated at home 20 died or 17.2 per cent., the total case mortality being 19.3 per cent. The number of deaths at home is 7.8 above the corrected decennial average. This disease shows a decided increase, not only in this district, but over the whole Metropolitan area. As it is such a very fatal disease, the most fatal to young persons, it is necessary that every precaution be taken to prevent its spread. There can be little doubt that the aggregation of children in public elementary schools plays a large part in its spread. That this is the case in other zymotic diseases as measles and scarlet fever, it has been conclusively proved, and as direct infection from case to case plays the most important part in diphtheria, there seems no reason to doubt that the latter also is spread by means of schools. In this regard the following statistics are interesting, and it will be ssen that by far the larger number of cases occur at school ages, i.e., from 5 to 15. Number of Cases of Diphtheria Notified with Number of Deaths. Under 1 1 to 5. 5 to 19. 15 upwards. Cases. 2 34 74 41 Deaths. 0 11 7 2 196 Membranous Croup 27 notifications of this disease were received as compared with 12 last year. Of these 15 or 55.5 per cent. died. None of these cases were removed to hospital. Croup is always regarded as being laryngeal diphtheria, and is a much more fatal disease occurring in that part of the respiratory tract. From the following Table it will be seen that school attendance cannot play the same part in its causation, as by far the largest number of cases occurred in children under school ago:— Number of Cases of Membranous Croup Notified with Number of Deaths. Under 1. 1 to 5. 5 to 15. 15 upwards. Cases. 1 18 7 1 Deaths. 1 8 6 0 In every case of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup careful investigation was made for any sanitary defects, and in 48 cases defects were found. These were in every instance remedied. Enteric Fever. 39 cases were notified with 9 deaths, 10 cases were removed to Hospital where 3 died, and 29 were treated at home with 6 deaths. Puerpera Fever, 6 cases were notified with 1 death. Erysipelas. There was a large increase in the number of notified cases of this disease, in comparison with the previous years. In 1891 the number notified was 90, and in 1892, 132, while this year the number was 194. 9 deaths resulted as compared with 10 in the previous year. Whooping Cough. The number of deaths from this was 26, 1.7 below the corrected decennial average. Diarrhoea. The total deaths were 37, 25 males and 12 females, and in out-lying institutions 8, 5 males and 3 females. Of the 37 who died at home, 29 were of infants under 1 year, 7 from 1 to 5 years, and only 1 above the latter age. 197 Taking into consideration the extreme heat which existed last summer, and which is believed to play so large a part in the causation of this disease, the death-rate is low. The number of deaths is .4 below the corrected decennial average. Influenza. Only 14 deaths were registered as due directly to this disease, as compared with 41 in 1892. The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs, however, show a large increase, and there is little doubt but that this increase is partly due to the continued prevalence of influenza during the spring of 1893. The following are the death-rates per 1000 of population from zymotic diseases, inclusive of deaths in outlying institutions. Diarrhœa .797 per 1000. Diphtheria and Croup .676 „ "Whooping Cough .497 „ Scarlet Fever .278 „ Influenza .278 „ Enteric Fever .179 „ Measles .039 „ The only death-rate which is above the average is that of diphtheria and croup, but, as previously stated, this increase was not confined to this sub-district, but was common to the whole Metropolis. Notification of Infection Diseases. The total number of cases of infectious diseases notified during the year was 868, as compared with 588 in 1892. Every disease but continued fever showed an increase : small pox, 11 ; scarlet fever, 137; erysipelas, 56 ; diphtheria, 46; membranous croup, 15; enteric fever, 12; and puerperal fever l more than in 1892. The number of deaths was 77, or 8.8 per cent, of all the cases notified compared with 9.6 in 1892, and 9.75 in 1891. The numbers of the several diseases, the number of patients sent to hospital, and the number of deaths that occurred in hospital, as well as in the sub-district, are given in the following Table. 198 TABLE VL.

The variations in the other notifiable diseases show nothing worthy of comment. Non-Zymotic Diseases.

Not specified The above diseases cause the great majority of deaths as they form 84.4 per cent. of the total mortality. 200 Diseases of the respiratory organs, as usual, cause the largest number of deaths, and the total number, viz., 184, is 40 more than in 1892, and 24 more than the decennial average. It is, however, 17 less than oocurred in 1891. The constitutional group of diseases, which includes gout, rheumatism, cancer, phthisis, and other tubercular diseases caused 115 deaths, 49 of these being due to phthisis, as compared with 58 last year, and 26 from cancer, as compared with 29 last year. The total deaths from diseases of the tubercular class were 79 as compared with 87 last year. This is 40 below the decennial average, and shows that the improvement in the sanitary condition of the district has a decided effect in lowering the number of deaths from this very fatal class of diseases. The general publio also are beginning to realise that phthisis 13 an infectious disease, and precautions of some kind are, now frequently taken by friends of patients suffering from it to prevent its spread. As a preventive measure, the disinfection of the bedding and clothing used by the patient, as also of the bedroom which the patient occupied ought to be carried out. The death-rate from phthisis in the sub-district, including the deaths in outlying institutions was 1.47 per 1,000, a death-rate which compares favourably with that of England in the quinquennial periods 1881—1885 and 1886—1890, which were respectively 1.83 and 1.64 per 1,000. Diseases of the nervous system caused 110 deaths, 45 below the decennial average. 33 of these occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum. Diseases of the circulatory system caused 57 deaths, exactly the same as in the previous year, and 9 above the decennial average. Diseases of the digestive system caused 62 deaths, 28 more 201 than last year and 16 above the decennial average. 23 of these deaths occurred in infants under 1 year. From premature births, low vitality, and congenital defects, 72 deaths were registered, 12 above last year, and 15 above the decennial average. 70 of these deaths were of infants under 1 year. It is interesting to note that of the 70 deaths, 53 were of males and only 17 of females. It is difficult to account for this great disparity, but one reason is that male children are more liable, from their size, to the accidents incidental to childbirth. The deaths due to old age were 29 in number, 11 below the decennial average. From violence 25 deaths resulted, 7 more than the previous year, and 1 above the decennial average. infantile Mortality. The total number of deaths of infants, i.e., of children under 1 year was 235, or 28.6 per cent, of the total deaths. The death-rate, calculated from the number of registered births, was equal to 146 per 1000, as compared with 145 per 1030 in 1892. Senile Mortality. The number of deaths above 70 years of age was 137, 8 more than occurred in 1892, and they formed 16.7 per cent, of the total deaths. Table IX. shows the number of deaths at various age periods. At every ago period the number of deaths of females is greater than that of males, and of the total number 49 were of males and 88 of females. H 202 TABLE IX. Age. Males. Females. Total.

The next Table shows the percentage of deaths to total deaths which occurred in the relative social position which the deceased occupied. It will be seen that the percentage of total deaths in 1893 does not vary much from the average of the preceding ten years, but that the percentage from zymotic diseases shows a diminution among the industrial and labouring classes.

A summary of the sanitary operations for the year is given at page 25. The number of houses and premises inspected shows a largo decrease, 2,319, as compared with 5,450 in 1892. In this regard I would repeat what your late Medical Officer of Health stated in his report of last year, that " it forms the disclosure of sanitary defects the first and necessary step for their abatement. It is idle to wait for such disclosure from the public generally, who seldom make complaint, except under the pressure of a nuisance which has become intolerable, or has already caused sickness or death." For the abatement of nuisances generally, 1,000 preliminary, and 204 265 statutory notices were served, being 100 and 94 fewer than last year. 497 houses and 558 rooms were disinfected after infectious diseases, as compared with 317 and 344 last year. This increase was due to the greater prevalence of scarlet fever and diphtheria. A still larger increase is noticeable in the amount of bedding stoved, 230 sets, as against 64 in 1892, having been sent to the contractor. In every instance this was performed with the utmost promptitude. 17 cases of overcrowding were abated, as against 2 last year. In the majority of the other operations a large increase is observable, only two showing a marked decrease. Theso were sinks altered to discharge outside gullies, 99 as compared with 522, and water-closets cleansed and repaired, 185 as compared with 435. This diminution is due to the fact that there are now few houses in the district where these do not already exist, or where the improvement has not been carried out in former years. The number of complaints submitted to the local committee was 1,101, as compared with 1,267 iu 1892. The cow-houses and slaughter-houses were inspected as usual, and found in a satisfactory condition, before the renewal of the licences. The bake-houses were inspected as well, and their condition as regards cleanliness and general sanitary state found to be satisfactory. I have also to report that the Sanitary Inspectors have performed all their duties with zeal and discretion, and I have more especially to thank Mr. Crane, the Chief Sanitary Inspector, to whose able assistance and co-operation I owe much. P. CALDWELL SMITH, MA., M.D., D.P.H. Camb., Acting-Medical Officer of Health for Wandsworth. 205 REPORT BY THE PUBLIC ANALYST FOR THE YEAR 1893. To the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District. Gentlemen, In accordance with the annual custom, I beg to submit a statement of the work done in my department, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, for the year 1893. The total number of samples submitted by the Inspector was 345, while one sample was sent in by a resident of the district under the provisions of the Act; thus making a total of 346 articles as follows:— Nature of Article. Number submitted. Milk 101 Butter 81 Coffee 34 Bread 30 Mustard 20 Pepper Cocoa 15 15 Flour 13 Vinegar 9 Condensed Milk 7 Lard 4 Spirits 4 Oatmeal 3 Cayenne 3 Arrowroot 2 Cheese 1 Jam 1 Tea 1 Olive Oil 2 206 The total number of articles condemned wa3 29, thus showing that 8'38 per cent, of the whole were adulterated, as compared with 9.68 per cent, in the year 1892. The following are classified lists showing the nature and amounts of the various impurities detected. I.—Dairy Products. Articles submitted. Nature and Amount of Impurity. Butter 100 per cent, of Margarine. Butter 90 „ „ Butter 90 „ „ Butter 90 ,, ,, Butter 75 „ ,, Butter 70 „ „ Butter 65 „ „ Butter 60 „ „ Butter 40 „ „ Milk 40 per cent, of added water.

Milk 27 The above Table shows definite adulteration of dairy products amounting to nearly 13.7 per cent, of the whole number of such samples examined, as against 14.3 per cent, in 1892. This small, 207 but decided improvement is also supported by the fact that while last year the average amount of dilution practised on milk reached 12 per cent., it is this year reduced to 10. II.—Groceries. The only articles purchased at grocers or oil shops found to be questionable were 2 samples of vinegar, which were not up to the usually accepted quality of the article, but, looking to the fact that the whole question of what constitutes a legal tender under the name " Vinegar " was then sub judice (it is not even yet properly settled), I advised that no prosecution should be undertaken on that occasion. This is the first time for very many years that no adulterated coffee or pepper has been obtained in the district. III.—Beverages. The only articles of this class which were submitted, consisted of 4 samples of spirits, and of these I checked 2 gins which had been diluted with water to the extent of 1 degree below the standard. As, however, such a small departure might easily be accidental, no prosecution was advised under the circumstances. IV.—Drugs. No samples were submitted in this department, and I would suggest that, although we have generally in former years found them satisfactory, it is yet desirable not to quite lose sight of them. This more especially applies to cheap popular drugs largely consumed by the poorer classes, because, even if no cases be obtained, I am still of the opinion I have so frequently expressed in my reports to you for the last 20 years, that more real good is done by having the Inspector always about looking after and taking samples of everything, than by paying special attention to articles likely to yield cases in the Police Court. In conclusion, I have to report that nothing novel has occurred during the year, either in shape of new adulterants or in procedure, except on one occasion in which the Board (doubtless noticing the number of cases of small adulteration of milk which 208 cropped up at one period) departed from their old established rale of giving warnings instead of prosecuting on very small oases, and proceeded against a vendor of milk. In this, however, they met with no encouragement, the Magistrate dismissing the matter as too trifling. Whether any adulteration at all can be considered " too trifling " for even a nominal penalty is, of course, a matter open to discussion, but, personally, I consider that the old custom is the wiser one. Magistrates are always more likely to visit defendants with proper punishment when they see that there is not the slightest appearance of straining after convictions on the part of the prosecuting Bodies, while at the same time, all real offenders are rigorously followed up. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN MUTER, VH.n.; f.r.s.(Edin.); f.t.c., &c., Public Analyst.
