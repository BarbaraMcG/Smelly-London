Paddington. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. REPORT OF THE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1883. PADDINGTON. The Parish of Paddington, in the County of Middlesex, extends Northward from the Marble Arch to Kilburn Gate; and Westward from the Marble Arch to Kensington Palace Gardens; it is bounded on the North by Willesden; on the South by St. George's, Hanover Square, and St. Margaret, Westminster; on the East by Marylebone; and on the West by Kensington and St. Luke, Chelsea; its length from North to South being nearly Two Miles, and its superficial extent about 1,280 acres. The Parish is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to which Board it returns One Member; and its management is vested in Seventy-Two Elected Vestrymen, who meet at the Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, on the first and third Tuesdays in each month (the third Tuesday in August, and the first Tuesday in September excepted) for the transaction of their ordinary business. For parochial purposes the Parish is divided into Four Wards, the boundaries of which are as follow; viz.:— ''All that portion of the Parish which lies within a hue drawn along the centre of Harrow Road from the point at which the same intersects the boundary of the said Parish, and thence along the centre of such Road to a point directly opposite the centre of the Road on Westbourne Terrace Bridge, and thence along the centre of such Road ward and of westbourne Terrace, to the centre of one. Bishop's Road, and thence Westward along the centre of Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the West boundary of the said Parish at the point where the same intersects the centre of Westbourne Grove, and thence Northward continuously along the said boundary to the point mentioned at the commencement of the foregoing description. 4 All that portion of the said Parish which lies North of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of WARD Westbourne Terrace to a point directly opposite TWO. the West end of the centre of Craven Road, and thence along the centre of Craven Road and Praed Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. All that portion of the said Parish which lies South of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace, Sussex Gardens, and Westbourne Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. All that portion of the said Parish which is not com- WARD prised within the foregoing descriptions of the FOUR. other Wards. Under the Reform Bill of 1832, Paddington was united with the adjoining Parishes of St. Marylebone and St. Pancras, such incorporation being called the Borough of Marylebone, and returning Two Members to Parliament. In the year 1870, upon the passing of the Elementary Education Act, the Parish, together with St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were united into a District called the District of Marylebone, for the purposes of the School Board for London, such District returning Seven Members to the Board. There are at present in the Parish 15 Ecclesiastical Districts, viz.:— St. James', St. Saviour's, „ John's, „ Michael and All Angels, „ Mary's, Christ Church, Holy Trinity, St. Mary Magdalene, St. Paul's, „ Peter's, All Saints', „ Stephen's, St. Matthew's, „ Augustine's. „ Luke's, 5 The Parochial Workhouse is situated in the Harrow Road near the Lock Hospital premises, its management being in the hands of Eighteen Guardians, elected annually, together with the resident Justices of the Peace. The Schools for the Workhouse children are at Ashford, near Staines; Paddington having been united by the Poor Law Board with St. George, Hanover Square, and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District. The Cemetery for the Parish is at Willesden, and is managed by a Board consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Vestry, such Board meeting at the Yestry Hall on the first Friday in each month. For Registration purposes, Paddington has been divided by the Registrar-General into the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional line of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street, from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish; the St. Mary's District lying on the North, and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line. For the purpose of providing the Parish with Public Baths and Wash-houses, Commissioners have been appointed by the Yestry, and Baths in the Queen's Road were opened in May, 1874, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145. The Gas consumed in Paddington is supplied by The Gas Light and Coke Company, and the Water by two Companies, viz.the Grand Junction Waterworks Company and the West Middlesex Waterworks Company. The population, as shown by the Census taken in 1881, is as under, viz.:— Ward No. 1 27,921 „ „ 2 45,879 „ „ 3 17,918 „ „ 4 15,500 Making a total of 107,218 The number of inhabited houses being 13,231. 6 The Rates levied since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act are as under, viz.:— s. d. £ For the year 1856 2 based upon a rateable value of 522,570 1857 2 6 „ 538,879 1858 2 4 „ 582,995 1859 2 7 „ 605,382 1860 3 0 „ 625,479 1861 2 8 „ 643,063 1862 2 8 „ 617,840 1863 2 8½ „ 646,256 1864 3 0 „ 663,172 1865 3 0 „ 685,434 1866 3 2 „ 704,714 1867 3 6 „ 729,838 1868 3 „ 740,686 1869 3 9 „ 759,158 1870 4 0 „ 773,524 Under the Provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. 1871 3 4 „ 954,868 1872 3 1½ „ 968,340 1873 3 4½ „ 984,582 1874 3 7½ „ 995,009 1875 3 6 „ 1,004,095 1876 3 6 „ 1,091,656 1877 3 6½ „ 1,098,262 1878 3 7 „ 1,115,550 1879 3 9 „ 1,125,644 1880 3 11½ „ 1,140,100 1881 3 10 „ 1,214,844 1882 3 10 „ 1,234,626 There are certain charities under the control of the Vstry, managed by Trustees appointed by the Vstry and the Charity Commissioners, and having an annual income of nearly Two Thousand Pounds, which is yearly distributed to the Poor in Coals and Blankets, in Grants to the Parochial National Schools, in apprenticing sons and daughters of poor parishioners, and in Annuities to aged persons resident in the Parish, &c. 7 REPORT.

By order, FRANK DETHRIDGE, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, June, 1883. REPORT of the WORKS EXECUTED in the PAYING & SEWERS DEPARTMENTS, by GEORGE F. STEVENS, Surveyor. to the VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Surveyor's Department, Yestry Hall, 30th June, 1883. Gentlemen, I beg to submit this my Annual Report on the various works executed, and the general business transacted in this Department during the Year ended Lady-day, 1883. Highways. A further removal of macadamized roadways, and a substitution of wood pavement on a Portland cement concrete foundation, have been carried out, namely, in— Seymour Street Connaught Square, on South and West Sides. Lower Porchester Street. Porchester Place. Norfolk Crescent, West Side. Upper Porchester Street. Sale Street. 16 Norfolk Crescent, North East Side. Burwood Place. Craven Road, from Devonshire Terrace to Spring Street. Gloucester Place, from Craven Road to Westbourne Crescent. Westbourne Crescent, and the intersection at Westbourne Terrace. London Street, from Praed Street to Grand Junction Road. Leinster Terrace. Gloucester Crescent. Sussex Gardens, intersection at Westbourne Street. Bishop's Road, intersection at Eastbourne Terrace, and Porchester Road, intersection at Westbourne Park Villas. The total number of square yards of concrete and wood pavement laid therein is 25,557, and the net cost, after deducting the value of the surplus old road materials used for repairing other streets in the Parish, is £11,841 10s. 6d., or about 9s. 3½d. per yard. The macadamized roads were broken up, the concrete was prepared, and the wood blocks were laid and grouted, including all the incidental works in connection therewith, by the Vestry's workmen as heretofore. 17 The total area of wood pavement laid in this Parish during the last six years is 90,719 yards superficial, and in extent is equal to 5 miles 1 furlong and 52 yards, at the rate of 30 feet in width of roadway. The gravel roadway in Dudley Street has been removed, and granite cube paving substituted to an extent of 474 square yards. The sanitary condition of the street is thereby much improved by this operation. All necessary repairs to water channels and granite crossings have been carried out, and various improvements effected. In many parts of the Parish the footway pavements were taken up, relaid, repaired, and new flags substituted for those much worn by excessive traffic in the streets. Repairs to the roadways and the extended use of granite on many of the new streets, rendered necessary by the increasing traffic, were executed with the aid of two steam rollers as heretofore. For paving certain new streets under the powers given by the 105th Section of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1855, and the 77th Section of the Metropolis Management Amendment 2 18 Act, 1862, much time and attention is still required in obtaining payment of the estimated expenses, and in carrying out the works at the cost of owners of houses and land abutting on such streets. The various sums received by this Department and, as usual, paid to the Vestry Clerk are included in the yearly Cash Account of the Vestry. A number of new streets have been formed and laid out, but not completed in consequence of the non-payment of all the estimated expenses for paving works. Many are nearly finished, and will be referred to in next year's report. The length of streets maintained at the cost of the Vestry is 44 miles 6 furlongs and 194 yards. Gas and Water Companies, and others, have opened 3,969 trenches in the streets, and the cost of reinstating same is £1,185, which has been repaid to the Vestry. New Sewer Works, Buildings, and Drains. Five hundred and fifteen feet run of sewer, of a capacity of 3 ft. 9 in. by 2 ft. 6 in., together with side entrance and air shafts, have been constructed by the Vestry's Contractor, in Inverness Terrace, between Porchester Gardens and Inverness Place, in lieu of a 12 in. pipe sewer constructed in the 19 years 1850 and 1852. In connection with these works, forty-two 6 in. pipe drains have been laid from the new brick sewer towards the houses on the east and west sides of the Terrace, also four gulley drains in roadway, at a total cost of £853 4s. 7d., which includes the cost of destroying the defective 12 in. pipe sewer. These works have been carried out in order to obtain improved drainage for the houses in this portion of the Terrace. Fifty feet run of sewer, of a capacity of 3 ft. by 2 ft., have been constructed in Stanley Street, from the east end of existing sewer there to the boundary wall of St. Mary's Hospital premises, for the purpose of draining the new wing building of the Hospital, at an expense to the Vestry of £50 13s. 9d., including the cost of a manhole for ready access to the sewer. One hundred and fourteen feet of 12 in. pipes have been laid, in order to divert the outlets of the 12 in. pipe sewers on the east and west sides of Inverness Terrace, south of Inverness Place, into the new deep sewer in Inverness Place, at a cost to the Vestry of £90 9s. 4d. One hundred and ten feet of 12 in. pipe sewer have been laid from the sewer in Bravington Road 20 along a portion of a proposed entrance to Bravington Mews, for the drainage of two houses in the Harrow Road, being the first and second houses east from the parish boundary, at the cost of the building owner. There have been erected during the year one church (St. Matthew's), 177 dwelling houses, and 17 stable buildings, for which notices have been received by the Vestry from builders, in compliance with the requirements of the Local Management Act, 1855. With reference to the drainage of these buildings, the Vestry passed the necessary orders, which were served upon the builders. The before-mentioned notices, with plans showing the capacity, position, and direction of the drains of the various buildings, together with copies of the Vestry's orders, are retained at the Vestry Hall for reference when required. The lineal extent of the drains shown on plans, and laid by the builders, is about 3 miles 1 furlong 128 yards. Stoppages having at times occurred in some of the drains of the houses on the east side of Woodfield Place, and which were connected with a small 21 pipe sewer in rear of the houses, the Vestry ordered new 6 in. pipe drains to be laid from the brick sewer in Woodfield Place to the water closets in the yards of the said houses. In compliance with the order, 6 in. pipe drains, together with all necessary connections therewith, have been constructed to 14 houses. A 9 in. pipe drain from the gardens of No. 8, and other houses in Woodfield Terrace, was found connected with the drain of No. 9, Woodfield Place, which had to be disconnected, and then continued to the sewer in the roadway in Woodfield Place as a separate outlet. The whole of the works were executed at a cost of £387 5s. 11d. The drain from No. 23, Woodfield Place, having been constructed by the owner (Mrs. Gooch), at a cost of £20 16s. Od. prior to the Vestry's order, this amount has since been paid to her by the Vestry. Under the public roadways and footways there have been constructed, at the cost of the parties making application, 123 drains from houses and other buildings, in lieu of drains which, upon examination, were found unfit for drainage purposes. The re-construction of the before-mentioned drains, repairs to sewers, fixing traps to house and gulley drains at sewers, and other incidental works, have been carried out at a cost of £2,342 7s. 11d. 22 In this amount is included the sura of £1,115 5s. 7d., received by the Vestry from various persons, for the construction of drains and other works required by them. One hundred and fifty-eight complaints received in this Department, having reference chiefly to obstructions in house drains and gulleys from various causes, and bad smells emanating therefrom, have been attended to at once, and the cause of complaint removed where possible so to do. Relative to examinations as to stoppages in drains, consequent on the before-mentioned complaints, the usual course taken is to examine their condition from sewer and insert drain rods along them and remove the obstruction; but should any drain be found broken in, either under the roadway or footway as the case may be, so that the obstruction cannot be removed and necessitates their re-construction, the applicant pays the Vestry the cost of a new drain and for previous examination. The total number of these examinations amount to one hundred and twenty-two. As many of the brick sewers in the Parish have not sufficiently quick gradients to allow of their being self-cleansing, it becomes necessary, in order that accumulations of deposit may be removed 23 therefrom, to periodically cleanse and flush them with water. The deposits which cannot be flushed away are removed from the sewers and carted away, such deposits so removed during the year amounting to 178 cubic yards. In order to improve the sanitary condition of the small brick and pipe sewers, water for the purpose of flushing has been used as often as required. The workmen in the employ of the Vestry have removed from the catchpits of gulleys two thousand two hundred and fifty-nine cubic yards of deposit washed into the pits from roadways during rainfall, the number of removals therefrom being 26,569. The frequent removals of deposits from catchpits considerably benefit the condition of the sewers, by reducing to a minimum the quantity of slop and other detritus from the roads entering the sewers. The nine public urinals in the Parish are attended to by the Vestry's workmen, who efficiently cleanse and deodorize the interiors of such urinals. The following additional improvements to sewers and street gulleys have been carried out, viz. :— The construction of two side entrances to sewers 24 for examining the condition of outlets of house drains, cleansing, and other purposes. The construction and re-construction of one hundred and twenty-five, and the repair of thirtyfour other gulley drains. Re-naming Streets and Re-numbering Houses.

SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1882. by JAMES STEVENSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT. To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. Gentlemen, The fifty-two weeks ending 30th December, constitute the registration year 1882. Daring that period 2,904 births and 1,948 deaths were registered in Paddington. Deducting the deaths of 182 non-parishioners, the corrected number of deaths in the Parish is seen to be 1,766, and the natural increase of the population from the excess of births over deaths to be 1,138, as compared with 1,172 in the previous year. Births. Of the 2,904 births, comprising 1,495 male and 1,409 female children, 2,240—1,143 males and 1,097 females—were registered in St. Mary's, and 664— 352 males and 312 females—in St. John's Subdistrict. The proportion of the sexes of the children born in the Parish during the year was 100 males to 94 females, whereas in the Metropolis it was 100 males to 96 females. 30 In St. Mary's Sub-district the proportion was 100 males to 96 females, and in St. John's 100 males to 89 females. The births were most numerous during the first, and least so in the fourth, quarter of the year. The ratio of births to the entire population of the Parish was 1 to every 37 inhabitants, or 26*8 per 1,000 persons of all ages. In St. Mary's Sub-district the ratio of births to population was 1 to every 32 persons living, or 31.5 per 1,000. In St. John's the ratio of births to population was 1 to 56, or 17.8 per 1,000 inhabitants. Some of the preceding particulars are shown in the subjoined table :— Sub-District. Estimated Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000.

St. John's 37,255 491 1 to 76 13.2 St. Mary's 71,115 1,275 1 to 56 17..9 Paddington 108,370 1,766 1 to 61 16.3 32 In 1882 the death-rate was in London 21.4 per 1,000. „ „ in Edinburgh 19.7 „ „ „ in Glasgow 25.4 „ „ „ in Dublin 27.9 „ „ „ in England and Wales 19.6 „ The annual rate of mortality in each one of the five groups of districts into which London is divided is shown as under :— North Districts 19.7 per 1,000. West „19.9 „ South „20.7 „ Central „23.9 „ East „25.3 „ As is usually the case, and as has been previously remarked, the death-rates were highest in the Eastern and Central groups, and lowest in the Northern and Western, the Southern group holding an intermediate position. It will be observed that the death-rate in the Parish in 1882 was 16.3, whilst that in the two preceding years was 15.7 ; but with these exceptions, the death-rate was lower than that recorded in many previous years. The same remark applies to the rate of mortality in London, that of last year being slightly in excess of the rate of 1881. In calculating the rate, no account is taken of the deaths, unknown to me, of parishioners in the hospitals of 33 the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and in other hospitals or places outside the Parish. Bearing in mind the yearly increase of population (more than 1,000 a-year), the subjoined figures, showing the corrected number of deaths from all causes in Paddington during each of the last six years, will probably be more intelligible to some than if expressed in the form of a death-rate :— Year . Corrected Number of Deaths. 1877 1,706 1878 1,761 1879 1,939 1880 1,667 1881 1,679 1882 1,766 During the year there were 396 deaths of infants under one year, and 663 of children under five years of age, representing respectively 22.4 and 37.5 per cent, of the total deaths in the Parish. The rate of infantile mortality in Paddington was 136 deaths to every 1,000 registered births. In London the rate was 151, and in the 19 largest provincial towns it ranged from 142 in Portsmouth and Bristol to 192 in Leicester. Zymotic Diseases. The Registrar-General remarks that "the most notable fact in regard to these diseases was the 3 34 subsidence of the small-pox outbreak. The deaths from this cause had been no less than 2,367 in 1881, but fell to 431 in 1882." Small-pox. In Paddington there were no deaths from smallpox. Six cases were removed to the hospitals, viz.:—1, that of a non-parishioner, was sent from St. Mary's Hospital to Deptford; 1 from St. John's, and 1 from St. Mary's Sub-district to Highgate; and 3 from St. Mary's Sub-district to Homerton. Measles. Measles caused in London 2,329 deaths, being in the proportion of 0.60 to 1,000 inhabitants. In Paddington there were 71 deaths, of which G3 occurred in St. Mary's Sub-district, and 8 in St. John's, giving a rate of 0.65 per 1,000; a rate greatly in excess of those during the years 1875-83, with the exception of that in the year 1876, when there were 91 deaths. Scarlet Fever. Scarlet fever caused in London 2,004 deaths, giving a rate of 0.52 per 1,000 inhabitants. In Paddington there were 22 deaths, a lower number than in any one of the last eight years, giving a rate of 0.2 per 1,000. Forty cases were removed to the / 35 Hospitals, viz.—1, a non-parishioner, from St. Mary's Hospital, 31 from St. Mary's Sub-district, and 8 from St. John's. Of the 40 cases, 38 (including that of the non-parishioner referred to) were sent to Stockwell, 1 to Hampstead, and 1 at the expense of the parents to the London Fever Hospital. Several cases were, as usual, treated at their own homes, of which no intimation was made to the Sanitary Department until its services were sought for purposes of disinfection. Diphtheria. Diphtheria caused in London 863 deaths, giving a death-rate of 022 per 1,000, a higher rate than any recorded since 1863, and nearly double the mean annual rate of the decade 1872-81, when it was 0.13. In Paddington there were 15 deaths, giving a rate of 0.14 per 1,000 inhabitants. Whooping Cough. Whooping cough caused in London 4,647 deaths, giving an annual rate of 1.20 per 1,000; the mean rate in the decade 1872-81 having been 0.80. In Paddington there were 72 deaths, giving an annual rate of 0.67 per 1,000. Fever. Fever, including typhus, typhoid, and simple 36 continued fever, caused in London 1,117 deaths, giving a death-rate of 0.29. The mortality from typhus, and from other or ill-defined forms of continued fever, was far below the average, the deathrates from them being, as stated by the RegistrarGeneral, the lowest on record. From typhoid fever the rate was 0.25 for the year, that for the decade (1872-81) having been 0.24. In Paddington there were 20 deaths, viz.—18 from typhoid or enteric fever, and 2 from continued fever; the deaths from typhoid fever giving a death-rate of 0.17 per 1,000. Diarrhoea. Diarrhoea caused in London 2,162 deaths, giving a death-rate of 0.55 per 1,000 of the population. In Paddington, including the 3 deaths ascribed to choleraic diarrhoea owing to the mildness of the summer, there were only 44 deaths, showing a deathrate of 041 per 1,000. Water. The average quantity of water daily supplied by the eight Companies to the inner circle of London was 141,266,549 gallons, being a decrease of nearly eight millions of gallons upon the previous year. This was an average daily allowance of 28.6 gallons per head of the population, and was amply sufficient, although it was 4.2 gallons per head less than in the previous year. Of the above enormous quantity only 37 8,823,337 gallons were of uniformly good quality. Of the remainder, which was river water, 69,947,394 gallons were at times largely polluted with organic matters; and 62,495,818 gallons were occasionally so polluted, but to a less extent. "The samples were in all cases taken directly from the mains, at places recommended by the Companies themselves, and they were therefore unaffected by the deterioration to which the water is liable in the cisterns of consumers." The temperature of the Thames water supplied by the Chelsea, West Middlesex, Southwark, Grand Junction, and Lambeth Companies varied from 40.5° Fahr. in January to 68.5° in August; it was thus but little above freezing point in winter, and was unpalatably warm in summer. The temperature of the water drawn from the Lea, and distributed by the New River and East London Companies, ranged from 41.2° Fahr. in December to 66.6° Fahr. in August. The deep well water supplied by the Kent Company varied from 43.7° Fahr. in December to 61.2° Fahr. in July. The Colne Valley Company's water remained practically constant throughout the year at 52° Fahr., as in 1881. Dr. Frankland repeats his commendation of the deep well waters, the best being supplied by the Kent Company. He remarks that the water of the 38 Colne Valley Company contained less than one-third of the solid matters present in the water supplied by the Kent Company and by the Tottenham Local Board of Health, and less than one-half of that in any of the river waters. This comparative freedom from saline matters is secured by submitting the water to Clark's process of softening, which consists in adding to it a small quantity of slaked lime. The proportion of organic impurity in the river waters is shown in Table B, and in times of flood it was so large as to make the water not fit to drink. The Lea water throughout the year was of better average quality than that from the Thames, the New River Company's supply being in nearly every case superior to that of any Company drawing from the Thames. Of the Thames waters the best average supply was that delivered by the Lambeth Company. Of all the water delivered in London, that supplied by the West Middlesex and Southwark Companies contained, as in the previous year, the greatest average amount of organic impurity. Paddington is supplied with water by the Grand Junction and West Middlesex Companies,which draw their supplies from the Thames, as do the Chelsea, the Lambeth, and the Southwark Companies. 39 For the preceding remarks, as well as for the annexed tables showing the condition of the London waters, I am indebted to Dr. Frankland's Annual Report to the Registrar-General. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Paddington, July, 1883. 40 TABLE A.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR OF PUBLIC LIGHTING DEPARTMENT AND SUPERINTENDENT OF WORKS DEPARTMENT. TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF PADDINGTON. Public Lighting and Works Department, Paddington, 6th June, 1883. Gentlemen, In submitting the Ninth Annual Report relative to the working of the Public Lighting Department, I would call attention to the fact that the Average Meter System continues to give most satisfactory results. This is fully borne out by the lighting rates levied during the past 16 years. YEARS. Amount. Total. YEARS. Amount.

From the September Quarter, 1874, the Vestry have purchased the gas used for public lighting purposes, under the Average Meter System, and had the entire control of all matters relating thereto. The number of lamps at the end of September, 1874, was 1,700, they now number 1,892. The lamp services generally throughout the Parish are maintained by the Gas Company most efficiently. During the year they have been applied to 141 times for the rectification of defective service pipes, all of which they have attended to at their own cost. Refuge Lamps.—In addition to the 17 onehundred candle power lamps erected last year, 6 more have been fixed at various rests, also 12 twentyfive candle power lamps at street corners, a complete list of which I submit on page 63. Damages to the following extent have been done to the public lamps during the year, through carelessness or accidents, viz.:—16 lamp-posts knocked down, 29 lamp columns broken, and 30 head-irons and lanterns broken and damaged. The rectification 53 of these damages has been executed by the Vestry's own staff of workmen; and, where necessary, summonses have been issued to enforce payment. In 18 cases the parties causing the damage have escaped detection. Reference to the undermentioned tables and details will supply useful information in connection with this department.

Report relative to the works of Dusting, Slopping, Watering, Carting Road Materials, Smith's Work, and Cleansing of the Public Highways, for the year ending Lady-day, 1883. Dusting.— The number of loads collected has been 18,262, and 3,819 horses employed in doing the work, the daily average number of loads being 60'27 or 4*78 loads per horse per working day. From the before-mentioned number of loads brought on to the Wharves, the following miscellaneous materials have been abstracted, viz.:—34 tons of coals, 481 cart loads and boat loads of hard core, 2,206£ tons of garbage or soft core, 55 tons of bones, 52 tons of rags, 34 tons 14 cwt. of old iron, 5 tons 7 cwt. and 1 qr. of various metals, 16 tons 10 cwt. of white glass, and 59 tons of black glass. There has been manufactured and sold 13,895 chaldrons of ashes, and 6,763^ chaldrons of breeze; of this quantity 5 66 10,930 chaldrons of ashes and 5,264 chaldrons of breeze have been sent away by 503 boats, and 2,965 chaldrons of ashes and 1,499½ chaldrons of breeze have been taken away by carts. Owing to the depressed condition of the brickmaking trade, and from other causes, the sale of ashes and breeze has not been so satisfactory, and I fear, sooner or later, the system of burning the entire dust collected in the Parish will have to be seriously considered by the Vestry. Street Cleansing.—This work is now carried out by gangs of sweepers, and, whenever practicable, by the horse scraping and sweeping machines; also by street orderly boys. As a Sanitary improvement, I would suggest the importance of providing street orderly bins along all the important wood paved thoroughfares, as the nuisance from the deposited horse droppings by the side of the kerb, during hot and sunny weather, is most objectionable, and is a source of complaint by householders, as being most offensive in every way, not only to themselves but to pedestrians generally. Slopping.—Nearly all the slop and dry sweepings collected by the Vestry's own staff of men is brought to the Depot, deposited in the filtering tanks, the water being drained from the slop, and the mud 67 placed in boats and taken away to Southall, under a contract with Mr. Studds, at 1s. 6½d. per ton, such amount including the haulage, tonnage, and shoot. The quantity thus collected from the various thoroughfares in the Parish during the year was 23,144 loads, being an excess over the former year, owing to the wet weather during the greater part of the winter. The maximum number of loads brought in in one week being 1,061, and the minimum 170, giving a daily average of 75.88 loads. By canal 24,305 tons of slop, &c., has been boated away in 686 boats, and some tons shot at open shoots, 5,507 horses and carts being employed, averaging daily 18.05, or at the rate of 4.20 loads per horse per day. Watering.— During the season, the water vans were out 130 days, 3,612 horses were employed, giving an average of 27.77 horses and vans per day. The quantity of water taken during the season for road watering and road making purposes, and the amount paid for the same, was as follows:— Gallons. £ s d. The Grand Junction Water Works Co. 20,330,000 @ 8½d. 720 0 5 The West Middlesex Water Works Co. 3,531,740 @ 9d. 132 8 9 Totals 23,861,740 £852 9 2 68 The before-mentioned quantities were recorded by 51 water meters, one being attached to each stand post. Carting Roadway Materials.— On this class of work, including cartage work for wood paving operations, 3,488 horses and carts have been engaged 302 days, giving an average of 11.54 per day. Horses.— During the year two have died, viz.:— In January, 1882, a grey gelding, of hydrothorax, the result of a severe attack of pleurisy. In October, 1882, a brown gelding, from ruptured liver. The present number of horses is 59 ; they are in good health and condition. In the autumn the usual practice of weeding out old and useless horses was carried out; seven were thus sold at Barbican, realising a net average of <£13 3s. 2d. During the seven years ending Lady-day, 1883, the percentage of loss by deaths has been 13.04, or a yearly average of 1.85 per cent.; by sales 35.65, or a yearly average of 5.09 per cent. The actual money loss by sales and deaths in the seven years has been 24.96 per cent., or a yearly average of only 3.56 per cent. I wish to draw the attention of the Vestry to this small 69 loss on horses, compared with other establishments in the Metropolis. Fodder.— The following tenders for the supply of fodder were accepted during the year, the average cost per horse for keep and bedding being 20s. 0.46d. One Week's supply per Horse. Tenders Accepted.

Considerable difficulty was experienced under the May Contract, the clover and hay sent being of such inferior quality that it had to be constantly rejected, better quality being obtained elsewhere, the Contractor being charged with the excess of cost. Carts.— The several needful repairs have been carried out by the artisans in the employ of the Vestry. The patent tipping waggons, purchased from Messrs. Glover & Son, of Warwick, are a great improvement over the old description of slop and dust carts, and the saving in maintenance, wear and tear of horses, by their extended adoption as the old description of carts wear out, will be considerable. Harness.— All repairs, and making new sets as required from time to time, are done by the Vestry's workmen. Smiths and Farrier s Work.— During the year the following work has been executed for the Highway Department:—595 pickaxes lined and steeled; 12,8G8 pickaxes, 487 chisels, 17 paving hammers, 75 crow bars sharpened; and several miscellaneous repairs of tools, &c. The whole of the horse shoes, shoeing of the horses, sundry repairs of machinery, and general smiths' work, in connection with the Works Department, have been executed at the Vestry's Depot. 71 The following accounts and tables appended to this report, will furnish details and information in connection with the working of the several departments during the past year, viz. :— A.— Account of expenditure and sales, &c., in connection with the works of dusting, slopping, watering roads, carting materials, supply of gravel and hoggin to Highway Department, repairs and maintenance of water meters, stand posts, and supply of water for road making and watering purposes. B.— Plant Capital Account. C.— Road Sweeping and Cleansing Account. D.— Return showing the weekly totals of the number of horses employed dusting, slopping, watering, and carting; loads collected, and sent away by boats; wages paid; expenses of haulage, tonnage, &c.; and daily record of the weather.

The 748 births, com. 2 prising 384 male and 364 female children, were equivalent to an annual birth-rate of 27.6 per 1,000 of the estimated population of the parish. Deducting from the total deaths (621) those of 50 non-parishioners, in the two hospitals in the parish, the corrected number of deaths is seen to be 571,— 273 males and 298 females,—and the annual death.rate to be 21.1 per 1,000 inhabitants. In calculating this death.rate, no notice has been taken of the deaths of parishioners in hospitals, institutions, or places outside the parish, or, on the other hand, of the deaths of non.parishioners in the Lock Hospital and in St. Mary's Hospital. The number of births and of deaths, together with the birth and death rates in the parish, and in its two sub.districts during the quarter, is shown in the subjoined table:— TABLE II. Sub-districts.

The 43 deaths in the Workhouse 23 males and 20 females being regarded as those of parishioners, are included in the 412 deaths registered in St. Mary's sub.district. Of the 75 deaths in St. Mary's Hospital, 48 were those of non.parishioners, as were also the 2 deaths in the Lock Hospital, and are therefore not dealt with in this report.

The rate of infantile mortality in Paddington was 147 deaths to 1,000 registered births. In London it was 158 ; in the 27 largest provincial towns it averaged 156, ranging from 112 in Hull to 222 in Blackburn. In Dover the infantile death.rate was only 89 per 1,000 registered births, whilst in Exeter, during the same period, it was 210, and in Ystrady. fodwg 216. The deaths of children under 5 years of age constituted 39'8 per cent, of the entire mortality, and were mainly attributable to diseases of the zymotic, local, and developmental classes. TABLE IT.

These figures show a death-rate of 3.58 per 1,000 inhabitants per annum, but as they represent only those deaths which actually occurred in the parish, no cognizance being taken of the infectious cases removed to extra. parochial hospitals, it is obvious that they afford only a partial indication of the extent to which zymotic disease prevailed in the parish. In London the zymotic death-rate from these diseases was equivalent to an annual rate of 4.14 per 1,000 inhabitants ; in the 27 largest provincial towns it ranged from 1.34 in Halifax to 8.17 in Brighton. In England and Wales the deaths corresponded to an annual rate of 2.61 per 1,000, against an average rate of 2.75 in the first quarters of the ten previous years, In St. Helens the rate was 1227 per 1,000 inhabitants. Smallpox.—Whilst this disease has been gradually declining in London and its immediate neighbourhood during the last four quarters, and has been simultaneously increasing in other parts of England and Wales, it is still causing more than four times as many deaths in Greater London than in the rest of the country. In Paddington during the quarter there was no death from smallpox. One case (a non.parishioner) was removed from St. Mary's Hospital to Deptford, and another from St. John's Sub.district to the Smallpox and Vaccination Hospital at Highgate. Measles.—In Paddington, as throughout the country, the deaths from this disease were excessive, and were equivalent 6 to an annual death-rate of 1.5 per 1,000. In London the rate was 0.56 in the 27 largest provincial towns ; it ranged from 0 05 in Birkenhead to 5.0l in Blackburn. In St. Helens it was no less than 9.5. Scarlet Fever.—Four cases were removed to Stockwell, one (a non-parishioner) from St. Mary's Hospital, and three from St. Mary's Sub-district. Whooping Cough.—In Paddington, of the zymoses next in point of fatality to measles was whooping cough, although throughout the country the deaths from whooping cough were far more numerous than from measles. Typhoid Fever.—Four cases were removed to Stock well from St. Marv's Sub.district. •/ Diseases of the Respiratory Organs.—Notwithstanding the mildness of the winter the deaths from these diseases were more numerous than during the corresponding quarter of last year. In the case of the very young and the aged, the fogs in the beginning of the quarter effected those fatal results which commonly follow from a persistently low temperature. 7 TABLE V., showing the localities in which deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases occurred during the first quarter of the year 1882.

During the 111 years, 1771.1881, the mean temperature of the months of January, February, and March, has rarely been so high as the mean recorded in the first quarter of this year. In London, the rainfall during the quarter was 3.88 inches. Vestry Hall, Paddington, June, 1882.

Of the 720 births, 2 comprising 371 male and 349 female children, 54G occurred in St. Mary's and 174 in St. John's sub-district. The 720 births were equivalent to an annual rate of 26.6 per 1,000 of the estimated population of the parish. Deducting from the total deaths (466) those of 42 nonparishioners, in the two hospitals in the parish, the corrected number of deaths is seen to be 424—282 males and 192 females—and the annual death rate to be 15.7 per 1,000 inhabitants. In calculating this death-rate, no notice has been taken of the deaths of parishioners in hospitals, institutions, or places outside the parish, or of the deaths of nonparishioners in the Lock Hospital and in St. Mary's Hospital. The number of births and of deaths, together with the birth and death rates in the parish, and in its two sub-districts, during the quarter, is shown in the subjoined table:— TABLE II. Sub-districts.

Of the 743 births, 2 comprising 380 male and 363 female children, 594 occurred in St. Mary's, and 149 in St. John's sub-district. The 743 births were equivalent to an annual rate of 27.4 per 1,000 of the estimated population of the parish. Deducting from the total deaths (375) those of 38 nonparishioners in St. Mary's Hospital, the corrected number of deaths is seen to be 337,—179 males and 158 females,— and the annual death-rate to be 12.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. In calculating this death-rate, the deaths of parishioners in hospitals, institutions, or places outside the parish, and of non-parishioners in the Lock Hospital and in St. Mary's Hospital, have not been included. The number of births and of deaths, together with the birth and death rates in the parish and in its two sub-districts, during the quarter, is shown in the subjoined table:— TABLE II. Sub-districts.

There was no death in the Lock Hospital. The 29 deaths in the Workhouse,—13 males and 16 females,— being regarded as those of parishioners, are included in the 246 deaths in St. Mary's sub-district. Of the 47 deaths in St. Mary's Hospital, 38 were of non-parishioners, and are therefore not dealt with in this report. TABLE III.—Mortality at Different Ages. Sub-districts. Under 1 year.

The rate of infantile mortality in Paddington was 135 deaths to 1,000 registered births. In London it was 165; in the 27 largest provincial towns it averaged 210, ranging from 122 in Derby to 317 in Leicester. Of 50 other provincial towns, the highest rate was reached by Yarmouth, where it was 297 per 1,000 registered births. The deaths of children under 5 years of age constituted 40 per cent. of the total deaths; 43 were due to one or other of the seven principal zymotic diseases. Of those 43 fatal cases, 36 occurred in St. Mary's, and only 7 in St. John's sub-district. TABLE IT. Principal causes of death in Paddington during the 13 weeks ending 30th September, 1882.

As the above figures represent only the deaths which actually occurred in the parish, no cognizance being taken of the infectious cases removed to extra-parochial hospitals, it is obvious that they do not indicate the extent to which zymotic disease prevailed in the parish, and that any death-rate based upon them would be misleading. In London the death-rate from these diseases was equivalent to an annual rate of 3.52 per 1,000 inhabitants. In the 27 largest provincial towns it ranged from 2.10 in Halifax to 8.54 in Hull. In England and Wales the deaths corresponded to an annual rate of 313 per 1,000, against an average rate of 3.94 for the ten preceding third quarters. Smallpox caused no death in Paddington, nor was any case sent to the hospitals. In London during the quarter there were 63 deaths. Measles caused 8 deaths, corresponding to an annual rate of 0 29 per 1,000 inhabitants. In London the rate was 0.41 per 1,000. In Huddersfield it was 2.55. Scarlet Fever caused 3 deaths, being at the annual rate of O'll per 1,000 persons living in the parish. 24 cases were sent to Stockwell, 18 from St. Mary's, and 6 from St. John's sub-district. In London the rate was 0.52 per 1,000. Diarrhoea caused only 24 deaths, being at the annual rate of 0.88 per 1,000, owing to the weather having been unseasonably cold throughout the quarter. In London the rate was 1.49. 6 TABLE V., showing the localities in which deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases occurred during the third quarter of the year ending 30th September, 1882.

Mr. James Glaisher, F.R.S., in his report to the RegistrarGeneral, remarks that with the exception of the first three days the month of July was cold, wet, and ungenial, the temperature being much below that of 1881. During the first half of the month of August the weather was moderately fine, whilst in the latter half it was cold and showery, although the rain was generally less than the average. During the first week the weather in the month of September was fine, but was afterwards cold and unsettled, and the air more humid than usual. The atmospheric pressure was throughout the quarter, with the exception of a few days, constantly below the average. The mean temperature of the air during the quarter was 58.1°, being 1.6° below the average for the corresponding period in 111 years, and showed 8 a deficiency in each of the three months. The rainfall for the quarter was 6.01 inches, being nearly an inch and a half below the average amount in the corresponding periods of 66 years. Testify Hall, December, 1882.

Of the 693 births, comprising 360 male and 333 female children, 536 occurred in St. Marys, and 157 in St. John's Sub-district. The 693 births were equivalent to an annual rate of 25.6 per 1,000 of the estimated papulation of the parish. Deducting from the total deaths (486) those of 52 nonparishioners in St. Mary's Hospital, the corrected number of deaths is seen to be 434—223 males and 211 females—and the annual death-rate to be 16.1 per 1,000 inhabitants. In calculating this death-rate, the deaths of parishioners in hospitals, institutions, or places outside the parish, and of non-parishioners in St. Mary's Hospital, have not been included. The number of births and of deaths, together with the birth and death rates in the parish and in its two sub-districts, during the quarter, is shown in the subjoined table :— TABLE II. Sub-districts. Estimated Population, April, 1882. Births. Birth-rate per 1,000 of Population. Deaths. Death-rate per 1,000 of Population. St. Mary's 71,115 536 30.1 309 17.4 St. John's 37,255 157 16.9 125 13.5 Paddington 108,370 693 25.6 J 434 16.1 In London the death-rate for the quarter was 21.8 In Edinburgh 20.5 In Glasgow 28.3 In Dublin 26.7 In England and Wales 20.0 3 The corrccted number of deaths in the parish from all causes during the corresponding: quarters of the years 18771S82 was as under :— Fourth Quarter Total of Year.

There were no deaths in the Lock Hospital. The 33 deaths in the Workhouse,—18 males and 15 females,— being regarded as those of parishioners, are included in the 309 deaths in St. Mary's Sub-district. Of the 72 deaths in St. Mary's Hospital, 52 were of non-parishioners, and are therefore not dealt with in this report. TABLE III.—Mortality at Different Ages. Sub-districts. Under I year.

In London it was 147 ; in the 27 largest provincial towns it averaged 172, ranging from 123 in Wolverhampton to 213 in Leeds. Of 50 other provincial towns, the highest rate was reached by Stoke-upon-Trent, where it was 215 per 1,000 registered births. The deaths of children under 5 years of age constituted 32 per cent, of the total deaths; 18 were due to one or other of the seven principal zymotic diseases. Of those 18 fatal cases, 16 occurred in St. Mary's, and only 2 in St. John's Sub-district. TABLE IY. Principal causes of death in Paddington daring the 13 weeks ending 30th December, 1882.

The number of deaths from the seven principal preventable diseases was 36, as compared with 49 during the corresponding 5 quarter of last year. As the above figures represent only the deaths which actually occurred in the parish, no cognizance being taken of the infectious cases removed to extra-parochial hospitals, it is obvious that they do not indicate the extent to which zymotic disease prevailed in the parish, and that any death-rate based upon them would be misleading. In London the death-rate from these diseases was equivalent to an annual rate of 2.9 per 1,000 inhabitants. In the 27 largest provincial towns it ranged from 1.15 in Huddersfield to 8.93 in Sunderland. In England and Wales the deaths corresponded to an annual rate of 2.37 per 1,000, against an average rate of 2.93 for the ten preceding fourth quarters. Smallpox caused no death in Paddington, nor was any case sent to the hospitals. In London during the quarter there were 38 deaths. Measles caused 7 deaths, corresponding to an annual rate of 0.26 per 1,000 inhabitants. In London the rate was 0.78 per 1,000. In Sunderland it was 4.85. Scarlet Fever caused 4 deaths, being at the annual rate of 0.15 per 1,000 persons living in the parish. 8 cases—6 from St. Mary's, and 2 from St. John's sub-district—were removed to the hospitals; 6 were sent to Stockwell, 1 to Hampstead, and 1 to the London Eever Hospital. In London the rate was 0.82 per 1,000, in Gloucester it was 8.55. This disease is almost invariably most fatal during the fourth quarter of the year. It was so in 1882, when, however, the rate during the fourth quarter was lower than that in any one of the corresponding quarters of the last ten years. Fever.—Of the 10 deaths ascribed to fever, 9 were due to typhoid and 1 to simple continued fever ; 6 of the 9 cases 6 occurred in St. Mary's and 3 in St. John's Sub district. In St Mary's Sub-district the cases were as under :— * (1.) Castellain Road. A law student, age 23, who contracted the disease in France—a circumstance of frequent occurrence. (2.) Senior Street. A delicate child, age 7 years, the daughter of a cabman. In the house in which this death occurred the waste-pipe from the cistern was connected with the trap of the W.C. (3.) St. Mary's Terrace.

The tenant complained of a bad smell at times from a drain. (3.) Star Street. Wife of a jeweller, age 28 years. Waste-pipe from cistern was connected with drain. Besides the 9 deaths above referred to, 5 other fatal cases occurred in St. Mary's Hospital, 4 of which came from Kensington, and 1 from Hoxton. 7 TABLE V., plowing the localities in which deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ending 30th December, 1882. names of places.
