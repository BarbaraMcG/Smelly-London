To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my report for the year 1958 on the state of the public health in Stepney. The population is still declining slightly but steadily, and according to the Registrar-General's estimate from 97,810 to 96,360. There were 1,818 (1,853) live births and l,l6l (1,214) deaths. The live birth rate is 18.86 (18.94), the death rate 12.04 (12.41) and the infantile mortality rate 19.80 (24.28). Two mothers died as a result of childbirth, giving a maternal mortality rate of 1.07 (0.53). Twenty-one babies died under the age of 4 weeks - a neo-natal mortality rate of 11.55 (15.65) and there were 35 (35) still-births, giving a still-birth rate of 18.88 (18.53). There was no serious epidemic of infectious disease during the year. Measles tends to recur biennially and after the high incidence of 1,399 cases last year, dropped to 199 in 1958. Total notifications of infectious diseases were 883 (1,917). Rates Death Rate: Number of deaths per annum per 1000 population. Still-birth Rate: Number of still-births per annum per 1000 total live and still-births. Live Birth-Rate: Number of live births per annum per 1000 population. Infant Mortality Rate: Number of deaths per annum of infants under one year of age per 1000 live births. Maternal Mortality Rate: Number of deaths per annum of women ascribed to pregnancy, child-bearing, abortion, etc. per 1000 live and still-births. (The figures in parenthesis refer to the previous year, 1957). 2 Much interest is taken at the present time in Poliomyelitis and I am pleased to report that only three cases occurred in the Borough. Many children have now been vaccinated against the disease and it is hoped this will have the same good effect as in America. Deaths from cancer of the lung continue to increase, from 54 to 62, and I feel it is my duty to mention once more that cigarette smoking induces lung cancer. Deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis numbered 15 - five less than last year, but new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis have recently shown an increase, perhaps influenced by immigration. There were no cases of smallpox, and no deaths from diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, scarlet fever or poliomyelitis. There is still a very serious dearth of Public Health Inspectors. I have in the Department at the time of publishing this report only five of the establishment of U district Public Health Inspectors. The specialist inspectors have helped by undertaking district work in addition to their other duties. Unfortunately East London does not receive its fair share of the very limited number of public health inspectors which are available, and the work suffers accordingly. Fewer persons in the Borough are getting married, the figures for the last three years being 976, 905 and 775. Deaths from road accidents increased from 6 to 10, and over the country as a whole now total 5,970. One wonders how high the figures must become before drastic steps are taken. On the 5th April a beautiful Holiday Centre for Stepney residents was opened at Sandgate. Photographs and a description of the centre appear on pages 20 and 21. Under the Clean Air Act, 1956, a survey was commenced of an area in the west of the Borough which will in due course form the first Smokeless Zone in Stepney. In concluding my report I should like to thank the Chairmen and members of Committees for their helpful support and interest and to the staff of the Department I accord my gratitude for the good work they have done throughout the year which was a difficult one owing to staff shortages. I have the honour to be, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FRANK R. O'SHIEL, June, 1959.

STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. General Information. The Metropolitan Borough of Stepney is bounded on the west side by the City of London, on the east by the Borough of Poplar, on the north by the Boroughs of Shoreditch and Bethnal Green and on the south by the River Thames, the river front being some 2.39 miles in length. It is roughly rectangular in shape, the length being 2.3 miles and the breadth varying from 1 to l½ miles, and contains approximately 90 miles of streets. The area of the Borough is 1,902 acres, and of this the river accounts for 136 acres and the inland water, consisting of docks and canals, 75 acres. Dark blue London clay is found under the whole Borough at a depth of between 20 and 30 feet from the surface. Above this level are layers and patches of gravel and sand, brown and yellow clays being found nearer the surface. In some parts of the Borough are layers of "made" ground, the result of earlier habitation, and, as is to be expected, the flow of subsoil water is towards the river. The area is to a large extent industrial in character, factory premises being spread throughout the Borough but tending to be concentrated towards the western end, with docks and wharves stretching along the whole of the river front, which forms the southern boundary. The chief industry of the Borough is the manufacture of clothing of all kinds, and it is estimated that one-third of the tailoring industry of London is carried on in Stepney. Other major industries include brewing, cigarette making, engineering and the manufacture of furniture. Stepney is also one of the most important wholesaling districts in London. The Spitalfields wholesale fruit and vegetable market and the London Fruit Exchange are situated in the Borough. Fifty Years Ago. The Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1908 contains the following information: The estimated population was 310,706 but, in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, was in fact somewhat higher. The birth rate was reported to be 32.5, the lowest then on record. The death rate was 16.6 and the infant mortality rate was 130 per 1,000 births. Among the causes of deaths reported were scarlet fever 55, measles 264, diphtheria 74, vdhooping cough 129, diarrhoea 262, enteritis 130, tuberculosis 66l, premature births 143, alcoholism 48 and cancer 233. Deaths of children under one yeax included 200 from diarrhoea and 96 from enteritis. There were 257 inquests on children under 5 years, 55 deaths being attributed to overlaying in bed by parents, 46 to convulsions and 29 to burns and scalds. 6 Notifications of infectious diseases included 2,114 cases of scarlet fever and 492 of diphtheria. Of 83 cases of enteric fever notified, many were found to have contracted typhoid from well water on hop pickers farms. For the second year in succession, the Borough was entirely free from smallpox. The Report contains the information that at that time there were 38 common lodging houses in the area, providing accommodation for 6,900 persons, and 38 cowhouses housing 777 cows. Of the 1,210 samples of food analysed 190 (or 15.7 per cent.) were found to be adulterated, as a result of which 84 prosecutions were taken. 128 samples of milk and 51 of butter were found to be adulterated. A butcher was fined £40 for exposing for sale on a stall 381-lbs. of tuberculous beef and dropsical mutton. It was stated in the Report of the Council for that year that Rotherhithe Tunnel, constructed at a cost of just under £1,000,000, was opened to the public on 12th June by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales. Population. The Registrar-General's mid-year estimate for 1958 is 96,360. Last year's estimate was 97,810. The census taken in 1951 showed the population to be 98,581. The section of the Registrar-General's Report on the 1951 Census dealing with the usual residence and workplace of the population, revealed that the Borough's daytime population was 141,400, compared with 98,581 night-tiue population - an increase of over 44 per cent. London's population is an ageing one. According to the Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council for 1957, the average age in 1901 was 27.7 years, compared with 37.8 years in 1957- The size of families is increasing very slightly, according to a report published by H.M. Stationery Office. A hundred years ago the average family included six children. By 1940 it was reduced to two. The biggest families are those of unskilled workers, averaging 2.64 children, and the smallest those of clerical workers with 1.49 childron. The density of population is now 54.56 persons per acre. During the year there was a natural. increase in population of 657; that is, there were 657 more births than deaths. Open Spaces. Additional open spaces brought into use this year by the London County Council were the Buxton Street 0Pen Space and the Bethnal Green Gardens Extension. There is in the Borough a little over half an acre of parks and open spaces per 1000 population. A list of the sites is given on page 68. 7 Births. The total number of live births registered in the Borough during the year was 3,903, and of this number 2,317 belonged to other areas. In addition 232 births belonging to Stepney occurred outside the Borough, making a total of 1,818 births (963 male and 855 female) to Stepney residents. The live birth rate is 18.86 per 1,000 of the population. The rate when adjusted by the comparability factor is 16.59, compared with the rate for England and Wales of 16.4. Illegitimate live births numbered 201, representing 11.05 per cent, of the total live births - the highest since 1945. Still-births numbered 35, representing a rate of 18.88 per 1,000 total births. Marriages. The number of marriages registered during the year was 775, being 130 less than last year. The marriage rate per 1,000 population is 16.1, compared with 18.5 in 1957. Deaths. The net number of deaths registered during the year was 1,161 (698 male and 463 female), compared with 1,214 last year. The rate of 12.04 compares with 12.41 for 1957. The principal causes of death were heart disease which accounted for 27 per cent, of the total deaths, cancer 19 per cent, and diseases of the respiratory system 19 per cent. Deaths of persons over the age of 65 amounted to 66 per cent, of the total doaths. Details of deaths by cause and age are given in Table 1 of the Appendix on pages 49 and 50. In England and Wales, today, the expectation of life at one year is 69 for males and 74 for females, compared with 40 and 42 years respectively in 1841, and 59 and 63 between the years 1930-32. Infant Mortality. Deaths of infants under one year numbered 36, giving a rate of 19.80 per 1,000 live births (the lowest for 6 years), compared with 24.28 last year. The rate for England and Wales is 22.5, the lowest ever recorded. Of the infant deaths 21 were under four weeks old, representing a rate of 11.55 per 1,000 live births. Last year there were 29 neo-natal deaths, and the rate was 15.65 per 1,000 live births. The neo-na.tal mortality rate for England and Wales is 16.2. The "peri-natal" mortality rate of infants (viz: still-births plus deaths occurring in the first week of life) was 29.68 as compared with 33.36 last year. The tables on page 51 show deaths from stated causes at various ages under one year, together with comparative figures over the last 5 years. Maternal Mortality. There were two maternal deaths during the year. One was of a woman aged 24 years. It was her seventh pregnancy and was a domiciliary confinement. The mother weighed 14 stones and the baby 10 pounds. The cause of death was haemorrhage due to retained placenta. The other was that of an unmarried woman, who was admitted to hospital with haemorrhage following abortion. She had not submitted herself for any pre-natal care and died from toxaemia due to infection of the womb. Accidental Deaths. There was a slight reduction in the number of deaths due to accidents, from 33 last year to 32 this year. These included 10 due to motor vehicle accidents (4 more than in the previous year), 15 in the home, 1 at work, 2 from drowning and 4 due to various other causes. (See Table on page 50 relating to road accidents). In 1957, nearly 6,700 persons throughout the country died as a result of domestic accidents. In Stepney during 1958, as stated above, 15 persons died as a result of this cause, which was two more than in the previous year. Unemployment. The Ministry of Labour has kindly supplied me with the following information as to the estimated number of persons residing in the Borough who were registered as unemployed at the end of the year:- Men Boys Women Girls 2,096 18 322 11 - Total 2,447. The total number of unemployed at the end of 1957 was 1,700. Comparative Statistics. A table showing vital statistics for the Borough at various years from the year 1901 is on page 52. 9 II. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES WELFARE OF AGED PERSONS. The Council is empowered by Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, to make application to a court of summary jurisdiction for an Order for the removal to a hospital or institution of any agod, infirm or physically incapacitated person who is living in insanitary conditions and who is in need of care and attention. During the year, it was necessary to apply for four Removal Orders under this enactment in respect of the following persons:- Person Age Removed to Remarks Mr. T.L. 81 Institution. Order for 6 weeks. Transferred to Mental Hospital. (Still away). Mrs. B.C. 74 Hospital Order for 6 weeks. Transferred to Institution. (Still away). Mr. M.M. 57 Hospital Emergency Order for 3 weeks. ferred to Institution - absconded. Mr. J.B. 41 Hospital Emergency Order for 3 weeks. ferred to Mental Hospital. (Still away). In addition to those persons removed under Magistrates' Orders, admission to hospital or institution was obtained for 36 other persons. Two women officers, one of whom is a State Registered Nurse and certificated health visitor, are employed for visiting aged persons in the Borough, and 3,465 visits were made by these officers during the year. A register of all old persons visited is kept in the Department. Amendments made to the register during the year are as follows Number on Register at 1st January, 1958 1,572 Additions during the year 401 Removals during the year 338 Number on Register at 31st December, 1958 1,635 The Council provides a service for disinfesting and cleansing bedlinen and personal clothing, under Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and during the year 457 parcels of clothing were dealt with. 10 In order to prevent injury, or danger of injury to health, Section 43 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953, operated by the Borough Council, makes provision for the personal cleansing in their own homes of aged persons who are verminous or otherwise in need of a bath. 605 baths were given to 76 old people during the year by the Borough Council's Home Bathing Service. Grants may be made under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, to Voluntary Associations whose activities include the provision of recreation and meals for old people. There are 19 old people's clubs in the Borough, seventeen of these being affiliated to the Stepney Old People Welfare Association.* The Council is represented on this body by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee and other members of the Council and by the Medical Officer of Health, and applications made to the Council by old people's clubs for grants under the National Assistance Act, 1948, are referred to the Association for investigation. Grants made by the Council to the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association and to old people' clubs during the year amounted to approximately £5,800. A list of the clubs and facilities thereat will be found on page 69 A Mobile Meals Service is run jointly by the Old People's Welfare Association and the Women's Voluntary Service, a weekly average of 360 meals being delivered to homebound old people during the year. The mobile meals service was expanded this year by the provision of a third motor van for delivering meals and also by the appointment of a paid meals organiser. Five of the clubs, which include a luncheon club among their facilities, provided an average of 266 meals each week. Beaumont Hall contnenced supplying 'Kosher' meals-on-wheels this year, and by the end of the year 654 meals had been supplied. A Chiropody Service is provided, with a whole-time chiropodist, by the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association at clinics situated in six of the old people's clubs in the Borough, and on an average 325 treatments were given each month during the year. The Royal Foundation of St.Katharine appointed this year a visitor whose job it is to visit and care for elderly people suffering from some form of mental anxiety, in an attempt to prevent further deterioration and to help them to keep active and interested in the community. * Hon.Secretary, The Stepney Old People's Welfare Association, St.Katharine's, Butcher Row, Cable Street, E.14.

Inquests were held on 46 residents of the Borough, the verdicts.being 10 deaths due to road accidents, 12 suicides, 1 homicide, 13 accidents, 1 misadventure, 3 natural causes, 4 open verdicts and 2 due to other causes. Burials. Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places a duty on the Council to arrange for the burial of any persons found dead within the Borough where no private arrangements have been made. Sixteen such burials (13 adults, 1 child under one month and 2 stillborn babies) took place during the year at a cost of £153, of which sum £149 was recovered by the end of the year from the estates of the deceased persons or from liable relatives, or by way of grants made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. 12 Requests for burials came from the following sources:- H.M. Coroner's Officer 8 Relatives of deceased 4 Friends of deceased 3 Other sources 1 It is often necessary, where persons living alone die in the Borough, to dispose of the contents of their homes. This is done in conjunction with relatives of the deceased, or with the TreasurySolicitor where there are no known relatives, and has the effect of releasing the accommodation for housing purposes as soon as possible. Seven bodies recovered from the river were received into the mortuary during the year. FREE WASHING FACILITIES. The Council provides free washing facilities in 16 of the 22 public conveniences, with the aim of promoting food hygiene and cleanliness. Some 80,000 free washes were taken during the year. HEALTH EDUCATION. The Council co-operated with the London County Council in an intensive two weeks' Diphtheria Immunisation Campaign at the beginning of October. The aim was for at least 75 per cent, of London's 230,000 children under five to be immunised, end to try and combat the apathy which had arisen partly from the success of diphtheria immunisation in the past. It is considered that the disease has become so remote from the experience of young parents that it is necessary to remind them again and again of the results of neglecting immunisation. Publicity campaigns were also carried out during the year on Poliomyelitis vaccination, and Safety in the Home. Posters advertising the Council's new Holiday Centre at Sandgate, Kent, took pride of place on the large poster frames situated in the two main roads in the Borough. Posters relating to the Clean Food Byelaws, Merchandise Marks Act, Marking of Imported Food, Fish Wrapping and Poultry Plucking were also exhibited on lamp-post frames in street markets in the Borough. Posters on various health matters were exhibited at hospitals, welfare centres, day nurseries, public libraries and on the Council's vehicles and in public conveniences, and leaflets were made available at many of these establishments. Vacant sites in the Borough were kept posted with notices warning the public against depositing rubbish. 13 The Inspectors engaged in the supervision of food premises issued to the occupiers leaflets on the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, together with metal and plastic notices regarding handwashing and "No Smoking", whilst the Public Health Inspector (Factories and Smoke) distributed leaflets on the subject of Clean Air. Over 2,700 posters were displayed in the Borough during the year and 13,000 leaflets distributed. HOSPITAL FACILITIES. The undermentioned Hospitals are situated in the Borough:- No. of Beds. The London Hospital, Whitechapel Road. 685 Mile End Hospital, Bancroft Road. 475 The London Jewish Hospital, Stepney Green. 130 Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children, Glamis Road. 50 East End Maternity Hospital, Commercial Road. 58 The St.George-in-the-East Hospital was closed on 30th September, 1956, and used as a hostel for Hungarian refugees from December, 1956, until 31st October, 1958, since when the premises have been out of use. STEPNEY BOROUGH COUNCIL INFORMATION SERVICE. The Council operates an Information Service for the public at the Municipal Offices, 227-233, Commercial Road, E.l. (Telephone number STEpney Green 1818).

This year witnessed the birth of a project under the above Act which had been engaging the attention of the Council for some time, namely a seaside Holiday Centre for the residents of the Borough. A very attractive two-storey building known as "The Manor House" at Sandgate, near Folkestone, Kent, standing in spacious grounds and situated some 400 yards from the sea, was purchased by the Council in November, 1957. After works of adaptation and repair, the facilities made available for visitors include 12 bedrooms, dining room, lounge, recreation room and lounge hall, as well as a small camping site in the grounds for camping parties from Borough youth organisations. The Manor House Holiday Centre, as it is now known, is open all the year round, and is available to any resident of the Borough, young and old, for a week or a fortnight's holiday at reasonable cost. By means of a grant made by the Borough Council to the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association, under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, old persons may have a holiday at the Manor House at the considerably reduced rate of £2 per week, and of the total accommodation available each week half is allotted to old people. Coach transport is provided to and from the Public Health Department and the Manor House each Saturday. The first visitors were received at the Holiday Centre on Easter Saturday, 5th April, 1958, and the formal opening by His Worship the Mayor, Councillor W. Sullivan, J.P., took place on 21st June, 1958, in the presence of the Mayor of Folkestone and representatives of the Boroughs of Stepney and Folkestone. By the.end of the year, 558 residents of the Borough had taken a holiday of one week or two weeks at the Manor House Holiday Centre. The management and control of the Holiday Centre are vested in the Council's Physical Training and Recreation Committee, and the day-to-day administration is the responsibility of the Medical Officer of Health. Photographs of the Manor House Holiday Centre face this page, and the conditions and charges for the first year of running are described in a leaflet, extracts from which are given below. "The Manor House is a Holiday Centre run by the Stepney "Borough Council, and is for the use of all residents "of the Borough, young and old. It is pleasantly "situated, stands in its own grounds, and is about "400 yards from the sea and the shops. Folkestone is "within easy reach (seven minutes by bus). "The Lounge and Dining Room are centrally heated and the "bedrooms have hot and cold water, interior sprung "mattresses and metered gas and electric fires. 20 "The Holiday Centre is well-equipped with recreational "facilities, including a games room, television, radio, "etc. "SCALE OF CHARGES Adults £4.10s.0d per week. Children- 5 to 16 years if at school £2.10s.0d per week. 6 months to 5 years £1. 0s.0d per week. Under 6 months No charge. Week-ends 15s.0d per day. "PERSONS WISHING TO BOOK ACCOMMODATION "should apply at the Public Health Department, 43 White "Horse Road, E.l, for a holiday booking form, and details "of available dates. The form should be completed and "returned as soon as possible, together with a deposit of "£1 per person per week for the period booked. The balance "of the charge, together with the Coach fare, must be paid "in full seven days before the holiday is due to commence. "The maximum period for which a person can be accommodated " in any one year is two weeks. "Owing to the limited number of single rooms available, "separate rooms cannot be guaranteed, but every effort will "bo made to meet the requirements of individual applicants "wherever possible. "Travel Facilities to and from the Holiday Centre will be by "private Motor Coach on Saturdays, for which an additional "charge will be made. "SPECIAL FACILITIES FOR OLD PERSONS "Old Persons wishing to be accommodated at the SPECIAL "REDUCED TERMS of £2 per week with Free Transport to and "from the Holiday Centre may avail themselves of a scheme "which the Borough Council has made with the old people's "welfare organisations in the Borough. They should apply "to the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association or to "any old persons' club in the Borough, who will make the "necessary arrangements for them with the Council, or to "the Public Health Department, 43 White Horse Road, E.l. "This applies to all old persons resident in the Borough "of Stepney, whether they are members of a club or not, "i.e. men of 65 or over and women of 60 or over. "(The above scheme for old persons operates under Section "31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948)" 21 III. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES The District Public Health Inspectors' served 2,713 notices during the year, and in 40 cases legal proceedings were employed to enforce compliance therewith. Another duty to fall upon the Public Health Inspectors during the year was the enforcement of the Council's Byelaws as to artificial lighting of common staircases in tenement houses and flats, which came into operation on 1st April. In addition, this year's London County Council (General Powers) Act transferred to the Borough Council the duty of enforcing the provisions of Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950, relating to lighting, facilities for taking meals, and washing facilities for employees. At the end of the year the Department was still four below the establishment of district inspectors. The Working Party on the Recruitment and Training of Public Health Inspectors estimated that 200 new inspectors were needed each year to make good the shortage. The numbers qualifying were 82 in 1955, 117 in 1956, 127 in 1957, and 174 in 1958. Certificates of Disrepair (Rent Act, 1957). During the year 238 applications were received from tenants for Certificates of Disrepair under the Rent Act, 1957. The Council exercised its right under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule to the Act in refusing to accept undertakings from landlords in respect of 18 premises. Legal proceedings were taken by the Council against the landlords of 5 premises where notices of increase of rent served upon the tenants embodied the statement that no certificate of disrepair was in force at the time, whereas in fact such certificates were in force. Fines and costs were imposed in three cases, an absolute discharge being granted in the other two. Clean Air. Certain provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956, came into operation on 31st December, 1956, namely those relating to the installation of new furnaces, smoke control areas, height of chimneys, and research and publicity. The remaining provisions of the Act came into force on 1st June this year, including those relating to the prohibition of dark smoke from chimneys, measures for dealing with grit and dust from furnaces, abatement of smoke nuisances, and the application of the Act to railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. The Minister of Housing and Local Government made regulations during the year dealing with permitted periods of emissions of smoke. In December, details of a preliminary survey of the Borough's first Smoke Control Area were submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for his observations. In March, 1959, the Minister gave 22 provisional approval to the Council's proposals, and a detailed survey of the area is now in progress. The area concerned is that part of the Borough enclosed by its boundary with the City of London and Commercial Street, Leman Street, Dock Street, Thomas More Street and the River Thames. Prior approval was given during the year to plans and specifications of furnaces submitted under Section 3 of the Act and proposed to be installed in an industrial premises. One of the existing members of the staff of Public Health Inspectors was appointed this year to undertake duties in connection with the Clean Air Act. Complaints of smoke nuisances received numbered 31, and 60 observations were made on chimneys. Measurements of air pollution are regularly taken in the Borough by means of deposit gauges and lead peroxide instruments, which give monthly records of deposited matter and of concentration of sulphur in the air, and also by combined smoke filters and volumetric sulphur dioxide apparatus which afford daily readings. Summaries of the recordings obtained from these instruments will be found in Tables 9 and 10 on pages 57 and 58. Drainage and Sanitary Conveniences. The owners of two premises appealed against notices served on them under Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in respect of a defective drain, on the grounds that, as the drain served other premises, the owners of those premises were liable to contribute towards the expense of executing the work. The Council defended the appeal, which came before the Court on three occasions, the Magistrates finally apportioning the costs between the various owners concerned. Another similar appeal was heard, and was adjourned by the Magistrates to enable the parties concerned to come to an agreement regarding sharing the costs of the work involved. Byelaw No.7 of the London County Council Byelaws relating to Water Closets, made in 1930, was repealed as from 14th May, 1958. The byelaw required the provision of water closet accommodation in a building in the proportion of not less than one water closet to every 12 inmates. In its stead the Council has, in common with other Metropolitan Boroughs, adopted the standard of one water closet for each household where practicable, and, where premises are let in lodgings, at least one water closet for every 8 persons or for every 4 rooms, whichever standard is the higher. Factories. A copy of the annual return furnished to the Ministry of Labour and National Service will be found in Table 18 on page 66. 23 Hairdressers and Barbers. On the instructions of the Public Health Committee, the occupier of a hairdresser's establishment was cautioned for carrying on the business of a hairdresser without registration. Legal Proceedings. Legal proceedings instituted at the request of the District Public Health Inspectors during the year, showing penalties imposed, were as follows:- _ No. of Fines Costs Summonses Public Health (London) Act, 1936:- Nuisance Orders 34 - £112.19. 0 Non-compliance with Nuisance Orders 4 £30. 0.0 10. 1. 0 Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 2 - 4. 5. 0 4.0 £30. 0. 0 £127. 5. 0 Appeals were heard in two instances during the year where notices were served under Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936.

The Public Cleansing Officer has kindly supplied the following information on refuse disposed of during the year:- House and Trade Refuse 34,850 tons. Street and Market Refuse 8,046 tons. Where possible, refuse collection is carried out by means of "Paladin" containers, mainly from blocks of flats throughout the Borough. This method was adopted in 1955, since when over 500 of these containers have been installed. The Cleansing Department carried out 25,000 cleansings of 5,300 street gullies by means of mechanical gully emptiers. Rodent Control. In accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, statistics on rodent control work carried out by the department were submitted to the Ministry covering the period 1st April, 1958, to 31st March, 1959. During this period 7,713 dwellings and business premises were inspected, and 1,589 were found to be infested either by mice or rats. Treatments were carried out by the department's rodent control staff to 1,354 of the properties found to be infested, the charges made for servicing business premises amounting to £589. By the implementation of Section 4 of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, it has been found possible to clear bombed sites of refuse which would otherwise act as possible harbourage for rats and other vermin. Moreover, under the same section, which permits specified works to be carried out, it has been possible to require sites to be fenced in by the owners. Legal proceedings were instituted on three occasions during the year ending 31st March, 1959, against the owners of sites for failure to comply with notices served under Section 4 of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, requiring them to clear the sites of rat harbourage and to make suitable provision for enclosing the sites to prevent further depositing of rubbish. A copy of the return furnished to the Ministry is on page 56. 27 Shops.

During the year the Public Health (Food) Inspectors continued to visit food premises' with a view to implementing the provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, and as will be seen from the table on page 37 many premises which lacked adequate washing facilities, sinks, etc. were required to provide them. Attention was also given to all the other requirements of the Regulations. The Inspectors continued to survey food premises on 'house-to-house' lines, and 553 premises were inspected and details of construction, hygienic conditions and facilities, etc. recorded. A summary of the visits made to food premises by the Public Health (Food) Inspectors will be found on pages 59 and 60. Bakehouses and Bakers Shops. A summons was issued against a baker for selling a loaf of bread containing a cockroach. A fine of £10 and costs of £6.6.0d were imposed. Butchers and Poulterers Shops. The two proprietors of a poultry shop were summoned for smoking whilst handling poultry. Each was fined £1 and ordered to pay 10/- costs. Bacteriological Examination of Foodstuffs. Samples of food submitted for bacteriological examination numbered 49, details of which are as follows:- Number of samples Number Unsatisfactory Observations Synthetic Cream 6 1 Presence of ba.cillus Ooli. Manufactured in another area - Local Authority notified. Pasteurised Milk 11 1 Failed phosphatase test. Subsequent samples satisfactory. Lachshinken Sausage 1 1 Presence of bacillus Proteus. Matter taken up with the manufacturer. 32 No adverse reports were received on the following samples examined:- Ice Cream Raw Milk Sterilised Milk Frozen Whole Egg Liquid Egg Dried Egg Albumen Dried Egg Yolk 6 3 1 4 4 2 2 Frozen Egg White Vienna Sausage . Salami Uncooked Saveloy Cake Gateau Sample Meal Sultanas 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 The samples of raw milk were examined for tuberculosis by guinea pig inoculation. Chemical Sampling of Foodstuffs. Samples submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis numbered 481 for the year. At the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, samples of potatoes were taken for analysis in order to determine whether they were affected by arsenical sprays used during growth. Twelve samples were analysed and all were found satisfactory. A number of oranges and lemons were submitted for analysis for the presence of diphenyl and ortho-phenylphenol, which is limited by the Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food)(Amendment) Regulations, 1958. The permitted amounts are not more than 100 parts per million of diphenyl or not more than 70 parts per million of ortho-phenylphenol. All the samples complied with the regulations. Several samples of imported dried apricots taken from a wharf in the Borough were found, on analysis, to contain amounts of sulphur dioxide preservative in excess of the 2,000 parts per million permitted by the Public Health (Preservatives in Food) Regulations. As a result, the dried apricots were detained under the Imported Food Regulations and were either re-exported, released for use as an ingredient in dried salad or sent for de-sulphuring. Some samples taken of imported Lebanese and Italian apples were found to contain an excess of arsenic and lead, as a result of arsenical lead spraying. Approximately 2,000 boxes of apples were involved, many of which had already been distributed from the wholesale fruit warehouses in Spitalfields Market. A considerable amount of work was involved in tracing the premises to which consignments had been sent and in notifying the Medical Officers of Health concerned. Arrangements were made to have the apples suitably washed, samples being taken after washing before the apples were released. Export Certificates. Seventy-three certificates were issued in respect of the examination of a variety of foodstuffs for export to the United States, South America, Canada, Sweden, West Germany, Italy, Malta and the West Indies. 33 The certificates necessitate the inspection of the foodstuffs to be exported and, on occasions, samples are taken for analysis before a certificate is issued. Investigation is made into the method of production, where necessary. Ice Cream. Five samples of ice cream and one of 'Parev' (Kosher ice cream) were subjected to the methylene blue reduction test, with the following reailts:- Manuf actured In Borough; Outside Borough Total Grade I 1 (2) 3 (7) 4 (9) „ II 1 (1) 1 (1) 2 (2) (The figures in parenthesis are those for 1957). Eight samples were submitted for chemical analysis and showed an average fat content of 10.22 per cent. Although there are 28 premises registered in the Borough for the manufacture of ice cream, only three premises were used for this purpose during the year. These were inspected from time to time under the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations, 1947-52, and the thermometer readings checked. No contravention of the regulations was found. Legal Proceedings. Summonses dealt with by the Public Health Inspectors (Food) during the year were a.s follows:- Number of Summonses Fines Costs Food and Drugs Act, 1955. 1 £10. 0. 0d. £6. 6. 0d Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. 6 22. 0. 0d 6. 0. 0d 7 £32. 0. 0d £12. 6. 0d Cautionary Letters. On the instructions of the Public Health Committee, cautionary letters were sent in respect of the following contraventions Sale of bread containing an insect. Sale of pork sausages 22 per cent. deficient in meat. Sample of milk containing 11.5 per cent. added water. Dirty conditions in a grocery shop. 34 Milk Samples. Milk samples taken and submitted for chemical analysis during the year numbered 98, including 11 taken at hospitals, schools and day nurseries in the Borough. All proved satisfactory, with the exception of a sample taken in course of delivery from a farm to a dairy in the Borough. A cautionary letter was sent to the farmer. The average fat and solids-not-fat content of milk samples analysed was as follows:- Fat Content Solids-not-Fat Channel Islands Milk 4.41% 8.85% Others 3.73% 8.56% Onion Peeling: Outworkers. From 1st June, 1958, all domestic premises used by outworkers for the peeling of onions became subject to registration under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. It is the duty of the outworker to ensure that the premises are registered and that the Food Hygiene Regulations are complied with. Of the four domestic premises in the Borough used for onion peeling prior to June, 1958, two were satisfactory and were registered: the other two outworkers gave up the work voluntarily. The Food Hygiene Advisory Council proposes to review the position towards the end of 1959, and if found possible will bring about the stoppage of onion peeling by outworkers. The Borough Council's policy is that the work of onion peeling should be carried on only in pickle factories. Prepared Food Premises. Four summonses were issued against the proprietor of a fish curing business for failure to keep clean the walls, ceiling, equipment, etc. Fines totalling £20 with £5 costs were imposed. Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations. 1937-48. 189 Detention Notices and 234 Release Notices were served under the Regulations. These affected a variety of foodstuffs, including almonds, cocoa, chillies, cinnamon, coffee, casings, dried fruits, egg albumen, gum arabic, ham, lard, sauerkraut, etc. Consignments of hams, smoked sausage and casings which arrived unaccompanied by the official certificates, were subsequently released on production thereof. 33 carcases of mutton, representing a 5 per cent, examination, were examined for caseous lymphadenitis by the cutting of the lymphatic glands. All the carcases examined were found to be free from the disease. 35 Zeebrugge-Harwich Train Ferry. 306 midnight or early morning visits and 120 other visits were made to Bishopsgate Goods Station for the purpose of examining 8,128 trucks of foodstuffs arriving from the following countries:- Argentine 2 trucks. Austria 3 Australia 50 Brazil 3 Belgium 386 Bulgaria 19 Belgian Congo 45 Canary Islands 5 Cyprus 4 Denmark 1 truck France 7 trucks Germany 31 „ Greece 1 truck Holland 21 trucks Hungary 408 „ Italy 6,249 „ Switzerland 5 „ Turkey 6 „ Yugoslavia 882 „ The weight of the foodstuffs examined was 77,605 tons, comprising 63,843 tons fresh fruit and vegetables, 8,064 tons canned meats and sausages, etc., 2,843 tons bacon, 2,451 tons butter, 84 tons rabbits, 69 tons confectionery, 67 tons preserved fruits and vegetables, 46 tons eggs, 34 tons fish, 21 tons horsemea.t, 17 tons fruit juices, 16 tons honey, 9 tons cheese, 5 tons cakes, 5 tons sauerkraut, 5 tons wheat gluten and 28 tons miscellaneous foodstuffs. Foodstuffs found to be unsound and which were stopped and destroyed, amounted to 7 tons 6 cwts. Two trucks of Italian apples were detained and samples taken for examination for the presence of excess arsenic and lead. The samples proved to be satisfactory and the apples were released. Unsound Food. The following quantities of unsound foodstuffs were disposed of during the year under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937-48, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1936:- Tons Cwts. Qrs. Lbs. Wharves 41 15 1 19 London Fruit Exchange and Spitalfields Market 66 19 — 17 Bishopsgate Goods Station: Ex Zeebrugge-Harwich Train Ferry 7 6 1 4 Non-Ferry Goods 2 4 3 12 Other Premises 68 6 3 8 186 12 2 4 Approximately 20 tons of unsound food were allowed to be used for animal feeding purposes, or for manufacturing purposes other than for 36 human consumption, the remainder being delivered to, or collected by the Public Cleansing Department at whose riverside depot it was mixed with household refuse, under the supervision of the Public Cleansing Officer, and removed by barge to a controlled tipping site in Essex. Approximately 2,500 Condemnation Certificates in respect of unsound food were issued in 1958. Improvements effected at Food Establishments. Lavatory basins installed Premises where hot and cold water supply installed Premises where washing facilities for staff improved Sinks provided Food Storage accommodation provided Refrigerators installed or repaired Premises where walls, ceilings, floors and windows cleansed Floors renewed or repaired Shop-fronts improved Premises where ventilation provided or improved Premises where natural lighting improved Protective covers provided for displayed food Refuse-bins provided Miscellaneous 77 112 122 34 21 12 363 31 4 19 5 28 29 653 37 VI. PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Weather Conditions. There were no extremes of weather conditions in 1958. January and February were changeable with some snow and frost February being the wetter month. March and April were mainly cold, and April unusually dry. The su-er, like that of 1957, was generally wet and disappointing. May was wet and changeable, June the wettest since 1903, July changeable with a few fine days, August very wet, dull and thundery with little sunshine, and September was very wet but warmer, with sunshine about normal. The months of October, November and December were not remarkable for weather extremes of any kind. It was changeable with some fog in November and December, particularly at Christmas time. Notifications. A total of 883 notifications of ca.ses of infectious diseases were received during the year, compared with 1,914 in 1957, the difference being, in the main, measles notifications. The diagnosis was not confirmed in two of the notifications. Table 14 on page 63 shows details of notifications received, together with age groups. A list of diseases notifiable in the County of London is shown in Table 17 on page 65. Cancer. The number of deaths from cancer of all sites occurring in residents of the Borough daring the year was 221, being 28 less than last year. Deaths from lung cancer numbered 62, which is 8 more than in 1957. The association between cancer of the lung and smoking leaves little doubt that smoking is a direct cause of lung cancer. Diphtheria. Two notifications of Diphtheria were received during the year, one case being subsequently re-diagnosed as a carrier. The number of children i-unised at London County Council clinics during the last 4 years was as follows Completed primary course:- 1958 1957 1956 1955 Children under 5 years 1106 1147 1761 601 Children 5 to 15 years 420 415 439 84 Children given secondary injection 1372 1437 1563 893 38 Owing to the policy of deferring i-unisation whilst poliomyelitis is occurring in the district, the number of children i-unised in 1955 was considerably less than in other years. Notifications and deaths in England and Wales fell from 18,596 and 722 respectively in 1945, to 37 and 6 in 1957. Sixty-one swabs were forwarded by general practitioners to the Mile End Group Laboratory, where bacteriological examinations are carried out on behalf of the Borough Council. Dysentery. There was an increase in the incidence of Sonne dysentery, 145 cases being notified, compared with 34 cases last year. The occurrence of Sonne dysentery is co-on but seldom fatal, and then only in aged persons or debilitated children. One old lady of 70 years died from this cause during the year. Erysipelas. During the year six notifications were received. Food Poisoning. During the year there were 69 known cases of suspected food poisoning, all of which were notified. In 60 cases a Salmonella organism wa.3 isolated and in nine cases the causative organism was not discovered. Of the 69 cases, 57 were members of the staff of a hospital. The majority of these were young nurses, and in many Salmonella typhi-murium phage 2C was recovered from the stools. Examinations were made of foodstuffs in use, and a similar phage organism was obtained from one brand of English frozen liquid egg used in the preparation of food at the hospital. Although the outbreak was not traced to any finished article of food, the frozen egg may have been the cause. There were no serious cases and all made a good recovery. It should be remembered that many cases of slight food poisoning occurring at home and in restaurants are missed and not notified. Hospitals are more conscientious and efficient in reporting food poisoning outbreaks, and so the hospital outbreak comes to light whilst outbreaks occurring elsewhere are not discovered. The twelve non-hospital cases occurred singly and appeared to have no relation to each other. In three of these, Salmonella typhi-murium was recovered. Kala Azar. Notification was received during the year of the death from Kala Azar of a Pakistani resident of the Borough. This is a parasitic disease of Warner climates affecting the spleen and liver. Malaria. There were two cases of malaria notified during the year. 39 Measles. Notifications of measles in the Borough numbered 199, compared with 1,399 last year. There were no deaths from the disease. Epidemics tend to recur at intervals of just under two years. Meningococcal Infection. There were three notifications and no deaths during the year, compared with six notifications and one death last year. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. There were five cases notified this year. Poliomyelitis. Of the 4 cases notified -three paralytic and one non-paralytic, the three paralytic cases were confirmed. The County Council's Divisional Health Department of the area carried out 3,231 primary injections of poliomyelitis vaccine, and 3,211 secondary injections at its Welfare Centres in the Borough to children, expectant mothers and young adults. In addition, inoculations were given at schools in the area and at two large business houses. Puerperal Pyrexia. There were 26 notifications during the year, compared with 44 in 1957. Of these, 13 were residents of the Borough. Scabies. Scabies is still notifiable under the County of London (Scabies) Regulations, 1943. The number of cases formally notified wa.s 53, compared with 51 last year. One-hundred-nnd-seven scabies patients and contacts were treated by medicinal baths at the Branch Road Treatment Centre and their clothing disinfested, viz:- Males Females Children 50 41 16 The number of baths given during the year totalled 160. Scarlet Fever. There were 97 cases notified and no deaths from the disease-. Smallpox. No cases of smallpox were notified during the year and it was not necessary for me to take action under the Public Health (Smallpox) Regulations, 1917. Frequent notifications are received from port and airport authorities 40 of persons coming into the Borough who may have been in contact with smallpox. Observation for the necessary period is kept on such persons by officers of the Public Health Department. The number of children successfully vaccinated or re-vaccinated at London County Council clinics during the year was 1,132. Tuberculosis. The number of primary notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis received was 136, compared with 117 last year, and the number of non-pulmonary cases notified was 9 as compared with 18 last year. The mortality rate for the year for pulmonary tuberculosis was 15 and for non-pulmonary 1 per 100,000 population, compared with 20 and nil respectively in 1957. (For details of register and notifications see page 64). Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations. 1925. These Regulations provide that persons suffering from tuberculosis of the respiratory tract shall not be employed in the handling of milk or milk receptacles. Power is given to the Council to cause such persons to discontinue their employment. It was not found necessary during the year to take action under the Regulations. Tuberculosis Care Co-ittee. The Tuberculosis Care Co-ittee, on which are represented voluntary and official bodies, and whose meetings are attended by the Medical Officer of Health, continues to supply help to tuberculous persons and to their relatives who require assistance which cannot be obtained from official sources, or where urgency or special circumstances indicate that the voluntary sources of the Care Co-ittee are preferable. Although tuberculosis is slowly but surely being conquered, the public should realise that much help is still needed to be given to persons suffering from the disease. Help was given during the year to 62 persons by way of clothing, extra nourishment, bedding, holiday expenses, radio licences, and fares to relatives visiting patients in sanatoria. The Care Co-ittee again provided a day's coach outing to the sea for 18 patients and Christmas gifts for 52 patients. The Annual Christmas Seal Sale Fund amounted to £157 and this was supplemented by donations from various organisations, for which the Care Co-ittee is most grateful. Where possible, grants were obtained from statutory and voluntary funds, but where these could not be obtained, the funds of the Co-ittee were used. The Occupational Therapy Scheme continued during the year, and mainly benefits the chronic cases confined to home. 41 Whooping Cough. Thirty-six cases were notified during the year, the figure for 1957 being 77. There were no deaths from the disease. Infectious Disease Contacts. Where a person is precluded from continuing at work, by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with an infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are only paid on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was not found necessary to issue any certificates during the year. Authentication of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. A person proceeding abroad is required in certain countries to produce a certificate of recent successful vaccination and inoculation, and, in addition, the signature of the vaccinating doctor must be verified by the Medical Officer of Health of the district. The signatures on 613 such certificates were verified during the year as those of medical practitioners practising in Stepney, and the certificates were endorsed accordingly. Disinfection. Premises disinfected because of infectious disease numbered 57, which included three for pulmonary tuberculosis. 7,935 articles of clothing and bedding were steam disinfected, including 96 articles and one-hundredweight rags for export, for which 7 certificates were issued. Formaldehyde disinfection of 160,995 articles of clothing and 400 tons boots and 180 tons of wastepaper for export was also carried out during the year, for which 125 certificates were issued. The charges for export and other disinfections carried out amounted to £78. Disinfestation (bed bugs and other insect pests'). The following is a su-ary of work carried out by the specialist Inspector engaged on disinfestation duties:- General inspection for vermin 1,076 Attempted visits 166 Number of premises found verminous 397 11 „ re-visits 180 „ „ miscellaneous visits 757 „ „ premises sprayed 642 „ „ rooms sprayed 1,532 Until May of this year, the furniture and effects of 1 persons 42 being rehoused in Borough Council dwellings were, as a precautionarymeasure, treated with hydrogen cyanide at the Council's Disinfestation Station, 42 Narrow Street, E.14. The Council decided in May that in future this treatment need be carried out only in those cases where the furniture and/or effects were found to be verminous. The furniture and effects of 82 families were treated by hydrogen cyanide during the year. In addition, disinfestation by steam and formaldehyde was carried out on 109 occasions of the furniture and effects of families rehoused by the London County Council. Many treatments were also carried out for infestations of cockroaches, beetles, ants, silverfish, and the like. Verminous Persons. The number of lice-infested persons bathed, and whose clothing was disinfested at Branch Road Cleansing Station was as follows:- Males Females Children 250 27 1 - Total 278. The number of baths and treatments given amounted to 288. Attendances of schoolchildren at London County Council Bathing Centres numbered 13,787 in 1957, compared with 34,110 in 1950. 43 SUMMARY OF PUBLIC ANALYST'S QUARTERLY REPORTS for the year 1958 During the year 481 samples were submitted for analysis, 139 of which were purchased or taken formally and 342 informally.

Milk. 97 samples of milk were examined during the year, four being of the superfatted variety (e.g. „Channel Islands„ or „South Devon„ milk), for which a higher minimum percentage (4 per cent) of milk fat content is provided for by arrangement between the producers and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The average composition of ordinary milk samples (excluding „Channel Islands,„ etc. milk), was 3.73 per cent fat and 8.56 per cent solids other than fat, and of the „Channel Islands„ milk 4.41 per cent fat and 8.85 per cent solids other than fat. Average composition of ordinary milk samples (excluding „Channel Islands,„ etc. milk) taken over the past ten years, is as follows:- Year No. Samples Examined. Fat, per cent.
