FIFTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Being the Report for the Year 1908. To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors,— I.— INTRODUCTION. I have the honour to present to you the Fifty-Third Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Although the Registration District of St. Pancras has remained practically the same area since 1856, except for a few adjustments of boundary described in the Report for the year 1900, the changes in the areas of the Registration Sub-Districts since the last mentioned date have been great. Changes were made in 1900, at the Census of 1901, and again in 1906, when the two southern Sub-Districts were amalgamated. So that now the four Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras, except for slight deviations of the outer boundary, coincide with the four Parliamentary Divisions. THE CENSUS. Working-class Dwellings.— In order to ascertain the distribution of workingclass dwellings throughout St. Pancras, the Census limit of tenements of less than five rooms was taken, and the areas of the enumerators of the Census were adjusted by assumption to fit the Sub-Divisions of the Borough. This adjustment is necessarily only approximate, but if the Registrar-General could be persuaded to issue an instruction for the Census of April, 1911, to Superintendent Registrars so to form their enumerators areas that they should not overlap municipal sub-divisions of areas, it would be possible to obtain a fairly accurate distribution of working class dwellings throughout a Borough. The result of the compilation with the material available is set out in the table below. 11 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OP ST. PANCRAS.

When the boundaries of the Enumerators' Areas did not coincide with the boundaries of the Sub-Divisions, an estimate was made of the distribution of tenements, according to the proportion of the area not coinciding, and of the class of houses contained therein.

West 61,903 South 55,983 East 59,694 North 59,578 £237,158 MARRIAGES. The number of marriages celebrated in St. Pancras during the year was 1973, being 157 less than in the previous year, and 194 less than the annual average of the precious ten years. BIRTHS. The number of births registered during the year was 5546, being 62 more than in the preceding year, and 671 less than the annual average during the preceding decennium. 16 The 164 births in public institutions having been re-distributed according to population, the number of births and the birth-rate of each of the Sub-Districts, and of the District were as follows :— Sub-Districts.

In Table 8, in a similar manner, the deaths from the non-notifiable "principal zymotic diseases" will be found set out. From these two Tables the mortality of the respective diseases, and of each of the groups, have been obtained, as shown in Tables Nos. 9a and 9b, and Tables Nos. 10a and 10b, and as compared as follows:— Phthisis.— This disease, the type of the tubercular group of diseases, was the cause of 362 deaths compared to 376 deaths in 1907, 401 in 1906, and 353 in the year previous to that.

The Registrar-General, in his Annual Summary for the year 1908, p. xxv., reports in reference to London:— "Birth-rates in Metropolitan Boroughs. In order to arrive at a reasonably accurate statement of the birth-rate in the several Metropolitan Boroughs, it is necessary in the first instance to distribute the births occurring in the chief institutions treating maternity cases. The institutions dealt with are enumerated in the footnote,* and it has been found practicable to distribute all but a very few of the births to the Boroughs in which the mothers Previously resided." The effect upon St. Pancras in 1908 was to increase the birth-rate from 23.4 to 24.6 per 1000 of population, as corrected by the Registrar-General. The Borough Council resolved to adopt the Notification of Births Act, 1907, subject to the statutory consent of the Local Government Board. On the 4th March, 1908, the Board approved of the adoption of the Act within the Borough of Saint Pancras, and appointed the 9th March as the date of the coming into operation of the Act. * Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital, Salvation Army Maternity Hospital, British Lying-in Hospital, City of London Lying-in Hospital, East End Mothers' Home, General Lying-in Hospital, Clapham Maternity Hospital, Woolwich Home for Mothers, London Hospital, French Hospital, Workhouse Establishments of Hackney, Wandsworth and Greenwich, and the Holborn Workhouse in Shoreditch. 25 The provisions of the Act may be briefly summarised as follows:— Primarily, the duty of notifying a birth to the Medical Officer of Health devolves upon the father of the child if he be resident in the house at the time of its occurrence; secondarily, upon any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within six hours after the birth. The notice must be given by posting a prepaid letter or post card within 36 hours after the birth or by delivery of a written notice of the birth at the office of the Medical Officer of Health within the same time. The local authority must supply, without charge, addressed and stamped postcards containing the form of notice to any medical practitioner or midwife residing or practising in their area who applies for the same. The notification is in addition to and not in substitution for the requirements of the Act relating to the registration of births, and it applies to any child born after the expiration of the 28th week of pregnancy whether alive or dead. Liability to a penalty not exceeding twenty shillings is incurred bv any person who fails to give notice of a birth unless there is reasonable ground to believe that notice has been duly given by some other person. A circular letter was accordingly despatched to the medical practitioners and midwives practising in the Borough, and in order to facilitate the working of the Act it was explained that there was no prohibition against the father or other relative or member of the family using the form of notice supplied them by the local authority, nor was there any prohibition against the medical practitioner or midwife informing the father, or, if present within six hours of the birth, any other relative or member of the family in attendance of her or his duty to notify the birth, and handing to her or him a form of notice for this purpose. The Notification of Births Act, 1907, has been adopted in twenty of the twenty-nine London cities and boroughs. It has not yet been adopted in Hammersmith and Chelsea in the West; in Hackney, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green and Stepney in the East; and in Wandsworth, Camberwell and Lewisham in the South. The Act was in operation during the last three quarters of the year, and from the tables in the Quarterly Reports showing its working some facts may be gathered as to the persons from whom the notifications were received. Of the total notifications somewhat under one-third were received from the fathers, and the proportion remained steady during each of the three quarters. The number of "other persons" notifying steadily increased from about one-fourth to one-third of the total number notified, "other persons" including relatives, nurses, etc., present at the birth. The notifications received from professional assistants diminished in number and those from midwives increased in a similar proportion, the two together remaining approximately a fifth of the whole. The doctors notified fewer births each quarter in the proportion of somewhat over to somewhat under one-tenth of the total number. 26 ACTION TAKEN DURING YEAR. During the year the action taken with regard to the prevention of the mortality of suckling infants is summarised as follows:— Births. W. S. E. N. Total.

PANCRAS. The summers of 1907 and 1908 were cold summers, and the St. Pancras method of prevention was not put to the test as compared with other boroughs and towns in the third quarter of the year. It was in this hot quarter of the year that St. Pancras did so well by comparison in lowering the mortality, as shown by the three years 1904, 1905, and 1906, especially in the last and hottest year of the three. When it is called to mind what a large proportion of infant mortality is caused by summer diarrhoea and other diseases due to improper feeding in the hot weather, if is apparent that the principal test of the value of a system of saving infant life bv breast-feeding is the total mortality in the third or summer quarter of the year. The prevalence of measles exerts its main effect in the second and fourth quarters, and cold in the presence of poverty, which connotes insufficient clothing and warming, in the first or winter quarter of the year, and prematurity more or less all the year round. The Quarterly and Annual position of merit of St. Pancras, compared to London Boroughs and the 76 Large Towns, for the years 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, and 1908, in regard to Infantile Mortality:— London Boroughs. 1st Qr. 2nd Qr. 3rd Qr. 4th Qr.

A few are sent in requiring special treatment in the way of instrumental delivery, etc. Of the 442 cases, there were about 110 only legitimate as far as I can trace; particulars are given in all but about a dozen cases. This proportion would thus be 1 legitimate to 3 illegitimate births." HOME OFFICE INQUIRY. The Home Office Inquiry, initiated in December, 1907, into the occupation and habits of mothers and the effect upon their offspring, has been confined to Somers Town, and as much of the rest of the East Division of St. Pancras as can be included, as the Inquiry must include all the births in a definite area taking place during the year 1908, and must extend until the end of 1909, when the last infant will have reached the end of its first year of life. The information should prove very valuable. REPORT OF THE WOMAN INSPECTOR. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, The work done during the year 1908, in connection with the lessening of Infant Mortality, has been carried on, on the same general principles as that of previous years, though differing somewhat in details. The various measures employed with the idea of inducing and prolonging natural feeding, have been the same as before, namely the distribution of advice cards, personal visits to mothers, and the referring of mothers and infants to doctors, hospitals, and dispensaries, where illness was suspected; otherwise to the School for Mothers, for the baby to be regularly weighed and supervised, and for the mother to receive advice, and where necessary extra nourishment (see Annual Report of the St. Pancras School for Mothers). 29 The work this year, has however, differed in two respects from previously:— 1.—Regarding Advice Cards to Mothers. Since the Notification of Births Acts came into force in St. Pancras, in March, 1908, this Advice Card has been sent to each mother within a few days of the birth, instead of being delayed for several weeks, until the birth had been registered, by which time it was often received too late for it to be possible for some of the instructions to be carried out. 2.—Regarding the visits to Mothers. In previous years a certain number of the most suitable cases for visits (as indicated by the class of street, and occupation of father) were selected, each week from the birth registrations, from all the divisions of St. Pancras. But this year our attention has been chiefly confined to one particular district— Ward VI., including the poorest part of Somers Town, and every home where a birth has occurred in this district has been visited. Thus every mother and baby have been seen at least once, and often several times, in order that our sympathetic advice might be offered to the mother; and also that on our part an inquiry might be made, as to the health and occupation of the mother both before and after her confinement, and as to the health and mode of feeding, &c., of the infant. This special inquiry has been carried on in St. Pancras during the year in order to assist in a general wide-spread inquiry suggested by the Secretary of State on the subject of the employment of women before and after child birth. As for this purpose it was thought desirable that the inquiry should extend "over a period of 12 months (thus necessitating a visit at the end of 12 months), it is obvious that the babies born during the year 1908 could not be re-visited at a year old, until during the year 1909, and that therefore the complete summary of this investigation for the Home Office does not come within the scope of this present annual report. However, the tables as to the mode of feeding of the babies visited as ascertained on the primary visits, are here given on the same basis as those of previous years (see Tables A and Al), and in addition, at your request, tables compiled from a completed 12 months' history of the feeding, &c., of infants born in the first quarter of 1908 are also included (as an addendum to this report), though part of the inquiry work that it entailed was in reality done in the year 1909 (see Tables I., II, III.). 30 Table A. 1908.

During the period, January-March, 1908, there were 29 births, of which 11 were legitimate, and 18 illegitimate Upon inquiry at the Workhouse I found that in only one instance had the mother given a Ward VI. address as the one to which she was going — and she had removed from there when visited.

All of those who applied to come and who were accepted as suitable proved themselves to be capable and enthusiastic workers. The majority of them only stayed for about three months, before being successful in gaining salaried appointments elsewhere as Sanitary Inspectors or Health Visitors, &c., viz., Miss Anderson, Willesden; Miss Cossens, Monmouthshire C.C. Schools; Miss Hartland, Bradford; Miss Muirhead, City of London; Miss Ryan, Bradford; Miss Sharpe, Macclesfield; Miss Thorpe, King's Norton; Miss Urquliart, Bradford; Miss Wright, Leicester. Miss McJannet left to do voluntary work L.C.C. Care Committees; and Miss, Day to take the Sanitary Inspectors' Board Certificate. It was with great regret and sorrow that we learned of the death (under an anaesthetic) of one of our former voluntary visitors, Miss Herskind, who through her sweetness of disposition had endeared herself to all who knew her. Mode of Visiting.—The homes visited this year being all (with the exception of about 120) in Ward VI. (Somers Town) were more uniform in character, and more uniformly poverty-stricken than has been the case in previous years when the visits were distributed more evenly over the various districts of the Borough. The nature of the questions included in the Home Office Inquiry Form made it even more important than usual that we should approach the mothers with the greatest delicacy and tact; and I always urged the importance of this on each new voluntary visitor, pointing out that if it were a question of the one or the other being sacrificed it would be preferable to fail to get statistical evidence rather than to lose our hitherto friendly relations with the parents.

Total Births (excluding still-births) registered (majority within 2 months) . . . . . . . . 5546 Births (including 120 still births) notified (majority within 36 hours), from week ending March 14th, 1908, to week ending January 4th, 1909 . . .. . . 2960 Advice Cards sent same day as receipt of notification, and to cases not notified on receipt of registration. . . . 5600 Number of visits paid:— . . . . .. . . 1732 ( Actual number of Infants visited . . 654 i.e ( Additional visits to Infants* . . 1078 * Of the Infants " not known " at address given 23 Infants " removed " from address given 38 Extra visits paid by myself to Hospitals, Doctors, Midwives, Nurses, Creches, Maternity Missions, Almoners, Relieving Officers, Workhouse, Infirmary, Employment Exchange, Distress Committee Office, Schools for Mothers, C.O.S., National Health Society, Sanitary Institute, &c. . . *358 *This number would have been considerably higher, if it could have included all the "visits" which had perforce, for press of time, to be replaced by letters and interviews at the Town Hall. 35 Notificatioii of Births.—The voluntary notification of births within 2 days, which was in force in St. Pancras for 4 months in 1906, was superseded this year by the compulsory notification of births within 36 hours. The Notification of Births Act did not come into force in St. Paneras until March, 1908, and consequently it has not been possible to give a full year's working of it. Of necessity, it will be some little time before all the parents become aware of the existence of the Act; but by means of your circular letter to Doctors, Midwives, Hospitals, &c., and through other measures, a fair proportion of the births were notified early to the Public Health Department. In comparing the number of notifications with that of the Registrars' returns it has to be remembered that the former include Still-births, but that the latter, unfortunately, do not do so. By taking all the births that were registered during the last quarter of the year, and by noting which of these particular births had been notified, it was found that the percentages of .Notifications to Registrations were as follows:— West, 67'8 per cent.; South, 65.6 per cent.; East, 79.2 per cent.; North, 60.3 per cent., or the total for the whole Borough worked out at 69.5 per cent. If this percentage appears lower than that of other boroughs it will probably be due to the fact of its having been worked out on a slightly different basis; . as for the purposes of true comparability between the number of notified and registered cases Still births were here excluded. The number of cases notified (March to December, 1908], and the number and title of notificants and attendants were as follows:— Notification of Births. W. S. E. N. Total. (a) Notified by:- Fathers 289 145 400 256 1090 Mothers 10 9 12 10 41 Other persons 209 148 326 131 814 Professional Assist 36 84 63 .. 183 Midwives 144 72 62 170 448 Doctors 37 56 142 46 281 Workhouse .. .. 98 . . 98 Homes of Hope .. 5 .. .. 5 Total 725 519 1103 613 2960 (b) Attended by:- Doctors 160 113 331 209 813 Midwives 246 91 233 362 932 Professional Assist 280 263 509 2 1054 Not stated 39 52 30 40 161 Total 725 519 1103 613 2960 36 Illegitimacy.— Of the total births registered (5546), the illegitimate births registered numbered 215, i.e., 3.8 per cent. The number of illegitimate births cannot be ascertained quite accurately from the notification; as cases which are apparently legitimate on the notification forms are found to be illegitimate when entered on the Registrars' returns (as it is easier to evade the truth in the former than in the latter). Respecting the number of deaths of illegitimate infants it seems impossible for the Public Health Department to estimate this in any way accurately from the Registrars' death returns, owing to the ambiguity as to whether certain occupations are peculiarly male or female ones, e.g.. when in the death-returns the occupation or status of the parent is obviously that of the mother the case is obviously illegitimate, and when obviously that of the father such a case is equally obviously legitimate, but when it may be either that of the mother or of the father it is not possible to know whether the case should be classed as legitimate or illegitimate in the absence of anv statement as to the sex of the parent. Clerical Work.—As before, complete and current indexes have been kept of all the Births registered and of all the registered Infant-Deaths. Further, since March, 1908, the Birth-Notifications coming in each day, have been carefully examined and copied on to their right district-sheet before being filed. These notification-sheets are also re-copied weekly by Mr. Ogden and forwarded to the LC.C. An Advice Card has been sent in each case on the day of receipt of notification. A careful comparision has had to be made each week between all the births registered and notified so as to avoid an unnecessary duplication, both in sending out Advice Cards and in paying visits; and also in order that cases which had not been notified might be marked for further action to be taken when necessary. Weekly reports have also been submitted to you as to the number of notifications, the titles of notificants and attendants, also quarterly reports as to the number of births notified, registered and visited, &c. Each year the amount of clerical work, correspondence, &c., has become increasingly large, but this year unduly so, on account of the Notification of Births and the Special Home Office Inquiry, and as a corresponding amount of regular assistance has not been given this work has had to be supervised and attended to by myself, to the sacrifice of personal visits to mothers. Infant Mortality.—The infant mortality rate which (when estimated on the same basis of infant-deaths per 1000 births, exclusive of still-births) in 1904, 1905, 1906, and 1907, was respectively 152, 136, 131, and 114, was 115 in 1908. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, Blanche Gardiner, Sanitary Inspector 37 MORTALITY FROM CONSUMPTION (PHTHISIS) IN RELATION TO OVERCROWDING. Sir Shirley Murphy, in his report on the health of the County of London during 1907, deals with the relation of overcrowding to the death-rate from Phthisis, the term "overcrowding" applying to that proportion of the population shown by the census figures of 1901 to be living more than two in a room in tenements of less than five rooms. The following table shows the mortality from Phthisis in groups of London sanitary districts, arranged in respect to the proportion of their population living more than two in a room in tenements of less than five rooms, during the years 1901—7. Percentage of over-crowding in each group of sanitary areas. T'rude Phthisis Death-Rate per 1000 persons living. Standard Death-Rate. Corrected Death-Rate per 1000 persons living. Under 7.5 per cent. 1.067 1.718 1.07S 7.5 to 12.5 ,, 1 349 1.705 1 373 12.5 to 20 ,, 1.456 1.771 1.426 20 to 27.5 ,, 2.009 1.805 1.931 Over 27.5 „ 2.015 1.651 2.118 London 1.520 1.735 1.520 In the above table the close relationship between "overcrowding" and Phthisis mortality is conspicuous. It will be seen that in the most overcrowded group of districts the death-rate from Phthisis is approximately twice that in the least overcrowded group. Statistics show that the decline in Phthisis mortality is continuous in London, the rate of mortality in the year 1907 being less than that of any year which has preceded it. III.— INFECTIOUS DISEASES. § I—DISCOVERY AND DIAGNOSIS. It is well to know that unrecognised cases largely spread infectious diseases. Discovery.— Mild cases of indisposition or disease excite no particular attention, or are attributed to other than the real cause by parents, guardians, or friends, and are not submitted to medical examination. In the autumn there are generally several instances of parents and guardians failing to recognise as infectious cases of slight disturbances of health in children until other children become infected and develop typical symptoms. 38 When cases of suspected infectious diseases occur there is sometimes considerable difficulty and delay in making an exact medical diagnosis in certain types of the diseases. Here bacteriologcal and additional clinical examinations are brought to bear upon doubtful types, and to check or confirm the diagnosis. Bacteriological Test.— The number of specimens of secretion, blood and sputum submitted to bacteriological tests during the year in suspected cases of Diphtheria, Typhoid or Enteric Fever, and Tuberculosis, and the results of examination were as follows:— Racillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Diphtheria (Secretion) 46 .. 76 122 Reaction obtained. Doubtful. Reaction not obtained. Total Typhoid (Blood) 9 • • 18 27 Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Tuberculosis (Sputum) 9 .. 37 46 Infectious Diseases fall into four categories— (a) Permanent compulsorily notifiable diseases, (b) Permanent voluntarily notifiable diseases, (c) Temporary compulsorily notifiable diseases, and (d) Non-notifiable diseases. 39 2.—NOTIFICATION AND DISEASES.

Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis or Cerebro-Spinal Fever was made a eompulsorily notifiable disease in London under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, by a resolution of the County Council on the 26th February, 1907, which came into effect on the 12th March, and the order has been renewed from time to time. Extracts from Memorandum on Cerebro-Spinal Fever, issued by the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board in July, 1905, were quoted in the Annual Report for 1906. The number of cases of the disease notified in St. Pancras during the year was five. CONSUMPTION (PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS.) Deaths from Consumption.

The Local Government Board has made Regulations, dated December 18th, 1908, to come into force on January 1st, 1909, for preventing the spread of Tuberculosis, including Pulmonary Tuberculosis. The Regulations have been made under Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, the Public Health Act, 1896, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. These Regulations require the Medical Officer of a Poor Law Institution and a District Medical Officer to notify within forty-eight hours of coming to his knowledge every case of pulmonary tuberculosis to the Medical Officer of Health of the area in which the uatient resides or resided previous to admission to a Poor Law Institution. They also require the Superintending Officer of a Poor Law Institution and a Relieving Officer, in regard to every person certified to be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, to notify the place of destination of a patient removed from a Poor Law Institution or from his present address, to the Medical Officer of Health of the area in which the new residence of the patient is situated. The effect of these Regulations during the first three months of their operation is shown in the following tables, extracted from my Report of the first quarter of 1909 :— 47 FIRST QUARTER, 1909.

Re work in connection with cases of Contiimption voluntarily notified during the year 1908. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I submit a report on the work done during the year 1908 in connection with the voluntary notification of consumption. The work of the past year has agreed in its more important features witli that of the previous year, and much of the report relating to 1907 might be repeated with reference to 1908. Few notifications were received from Mount Vernon during 1908 owing to heavy pressure of work at that Institution. It is hoped that this interruption of notification may be merely temporal y. Brompton Hospital has begun to notify cases, and expresses willingness to treat relations of patients notified who are affected by the disease. As before, the great mass of notifications come from the Poor Law Authorities. The connection of the disease with poverty and under-feeding is again very marked. In addition to the eases notified as having " no home," and to the cases coming from Rowton Houses and Common Lodging Houses, there were eighteen cases in which the patients' health was stated to have first broken down through privation resulting from lack of employment, or from earnings insufficient to meet the needs of the patient and his family. Further accommodation for patients, especially for the more respectable, is still urgently needed. It does not seem to be understood how greatly these persons suffer when forced into association with the disreputable and undesirable. No matter how excellent the discipline and supervision of a Workhouse Infirmary may be, it cannot entirely dispose of those erudities and coarsenesses of speech and conduct among the patients of the lowest type which add terribly to the miseries of those of a better type ; and this, too, at a time when every susceptibility to discomfort and annoyance is sharpened by long and wearing disease. Since the segregation of patients is pressed as a measure beneficial to the community, and not solely to the patient himself, it seems reasonable to ask that the measures taken to that end should be as little objectionable to the patient as possible. This view involves no reflection oil the management and methods of the Infirmaries. W arm appreciation is frequently expressed by patients and their friends of the care and kindness received from Officers of the Poor Law Authorities. 50 Matters of this kind are well worth attention; for in dealing with such a disease as phthisis, it seems important to gain acquaintance, not only with the material facts concerned, hut also with those mental facts, which, influencing the patients actions, tell upon the success of administrative measures, and so upon the spread of the infection. I have therefore tried to become familiar with the patients' thoughts and point of view, remembering always that actions apparently the most unreasonable and undesirable, often to their doer, present themselves as necessary and inevitable. To find out why patients are reluctant to enter Institutions; why, when unwilling to enter one they are willing to enter another; why they interrupt a process of cure or relief to return to homes obviously unsuitable; these and kindred problems are by no means useless lines of inquiry. For if, in the development of our measures for dealing with this disease, we ignore factors of this kind, we shall, in all probability, find a growing tendency to concealment, a'd to tardy resort to medical aid, which may deprive our measures of their full effect. Among the persons notified were eight soldiers and a sailor. Four of the soldiers dated the beginning of their illness from the Boer War. It seems a matter for regret that the Services do not provide more generously for men who are wrecked in health in the course of their duties The sleeping accommodation enquiries brought to notice the risks of infection run by persons living in lodgings shared by others. The worst case was one in which a consumptive occupied a bed during the night and another man the same bed during the day, both occupying it on Sunday nights. When a family has seemed unduly crowded, though not technically " overcrowded," I have often advised sending a daughter to domestic service. The Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants is very kindly willing to help and advise in such cases. There does not seem to be any similar manner of dealing with the boys of affected families. Help in this direction would, in carefully selected cases, be of great value. In the choice of occupations for patients or for persons susceptible to the disease, it does not seem sufficient to consider merely the outdoor nature of the occupation. A printer, who, with the idea of improving his healtb, became a motor omnibus conductor, grew worse rapidly. In several cases carmen and porters engaged in open air work speak of strains and inj uries from carrying heavy weights as having contributed to their illness. It sometimes seems that the disease has a tendency to recur in particular houses or groups of houses, but there is 110 clear indication of direct connection between the cases. In the one instance in which a second case was removed from a room, the second patient was stated to be in an advanced state of the disease before coming to live in the room. The Children's Care Committees attached to the Schools of the London County Council have been helpful in placing on the list of dinner-receiving children members of consumptive families to whom the danger of infection wras greater by reason of their underfed condition. The teachers of the Schools have also been most kind in keeping under observation children for whom I have requested special attention. 51 Much help has also heen given by the Invalid Children's Aid Association, by workers attached to various religious bodies, and by the Charity Organisation Society. W e are still, however, waiting for an effective scheme by which the various helpful agencies may be unified, and the work already begun developed and extended. We require much help in visiting the homes, in keeping families under observation, in visiting cases removed to hospital or infirmary, and in promoting wholesome living in various directions. We shall also require very considerable financial help for those existing agencies on whose resources our cases will make large demands. We may require some new agency such as the Anti-Tuberculosis Dispensary which has elsewhere been found to be of great value. On these matters it would be helpful to obtain the views of the District Medical Officers, of the Medical Practitioners of the Borough generally, and of those who are already doing work of much importance among the poor of the district.

(Legislation) of the Annual Report for 1907 the London Order of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, dated 12th September, 1907, as to the Notification of Glanders in Horses was quoted, and also the Regulations of the London County Council thereunder. In Part III. (Infectious Diseases) of the same Annual Report paragraphs relating to human glanders were quoted, and it was explained that in future, by the Order, a Veterinary Inspector must report the existence of glanders to the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough as well as to the County Council. During the year 1908 the Veterinary Inspector reported 38 outbreaks of glanders in horses in various stables in the Borough. § 3.—ISOLATION AND EXCLUSION.

CLEANSING OF VERMINOUS SCHOOL CHILDREN. It may be interesting to ascertain whether the cleansing of verminous schoolchildren in St. Pancras and St. Marylebone is having any possible effect upon the incidence of the infectious diseases which attack children. For the purpose of testing the effect of the cleansing of such children, the morbidity or mortality of certain diseases attacking school-children may be taken, and their incidence in St. Pancras and St. Marylebone as compared with other London Boroughs. For this purpose the morbidity-rates (notifications of disease) of Scarlet Fever and of Diphtheria, and the mortality-rates (returns of deaths) of Measles and the principal epidemic diseases have been taken (the morbidityrates for the two latter not being available), and the Metropolitan Boroughs classified in order of least morbidity or mortality for each of the four classes. From these classifications the table following has been compiled, showing the order of merit in which St. Pancras and St. Marylebone have stood each year since 1901. 56 Such comparisons must be made very guardedly as they present numerous pitfalls. The principal epidemic diseases cannot be much relied upon, because thev embrace also the diarrhoea and whooping cough of infants and the typhoid fever of adults, and are not confined to the diseases principally affecting schoolchildren, or likely to be spread by such children. Measles is a disease the maximum mortality of which is in the second year of life, the maximum morbidity or attack-rate is in the third year, and the maximum incidence of which extends from the second to the fifth year, and the number of children attending the oleansing station below five years of age are few. With the morbidities of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever the possibilities of forming a better judgment are greater, as both of these diseases are prevalent throughout school-age. In examining this table in detail it should be borne in mind that it was in 1904 that the Children's Cleansing Stations were established in St. Pancras and St. Marylebone, so that the table shows the position of the Boroughs during the three years before that year and four years afterwards. Whether it be a coincidence or not, it is an extraordinary fact that each of the Boroughs shows a remarkable improvement in its position in regard to the prevalence of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria after the establishment of the Children's Cleansing Stations.

In the Annual Report for last year (1907) an account was given of the changes which had taken place in the Inspectorial Staff from 1898 to 1907. Following on the resolution of the Borough Council of the 31st July, 1907, to dismiss a District Inspector for neglect of duty, &c., and the resolution of the Borough Council of the 18th of September, 1907, not to appoint a Sanitary Inspector to fill the vacancy created, copy of which resolution was forwarded to the Local Government Board, and upon correspondence thereon the Public Health Committee, on the 11 th December, 1907, referred to the consideration of the Drainage Sub-Committee the re-arrangement of the Inspectors' districts. The Drainage Sub-Committee considered the matter and instructed the Medical Officer of Health to report upon the re-distribution of the areas of the District Inspectors so as to cover the whole of the Borough in twelve as equable parts as possible. For this purpose the following table of premises required to be periodically inspected in each of the Sub-divisions of the Borough, was compiled during the second quarter of the year:— 67 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.

The Sub-Divisions are the units upon which the Borough is built up, so to speak, just as the Parishes are the units upon which the Local Government Areas are built up. With these as units, by combining the Sub-Divisions the data may be recorded in Wards, by combining the Wards in Parliamentary Divisions (which are also the Registrar-General's Sub-Districts), and by combining the Divisions the data for the whole Borough may be obtained. These are the several areas as shown upon the map of the Borough and in the Street List Index published by the Council; it is in these areas that all the records are kept, and to insure permanency, continuity, and comparability, it is essential that their boundaries should not be altered. With the Sub-Divisions as permanent initial units it becomes possible to keep under observation and control the work of inspection, and yet the units of area are so small that one, two, three or more units may be allotted to an Inspector according to the amount of work required in each unit without impairing the records, as the units can be added together to obtain records of larger areas. I beg to recommend— That the Sub-Divisions of the Borough be the minimum units of area of the Districts of the Sanitary Inspectors. In order to ascertain the probable amount of work in each sub-division, the number of dwelling places, of work-places, of drainage applications and plans, of complaints and of infectious diseases in each of the sub-divisions have been tabulated and multiplied by 4, 2, 8, 3, and ½ respectively, which are the approximate number of visits on an average of each of these several places inspected. These have been totalled and are set out in the table accompanying this report. In addition to this the sub-divisions in each of the divisions North, South, East, and West have been set out and totalled. From this table it will be seen that South St. Pancras requires approximately twice as many visits to be paid as North St. Pancras, and that East and West St. Pancras is intermediate between North and South. So that from actual figures the indication is that South St. Pancras should have twice as many Inspectors as North, and Central St. Pancras should stand between the two; that is to say, two in the North, four in the South, three in the East, and three in the West. When the sub-divisions are classed together so as to form Inspectors' areas a similar number would appear to be the proper distribution as shown in the table. In addition to this I would call the attention of your Sub-Committee to the map of overcrowding published in my annual report of 1903, from which it will be seen that the most overcrowded areas are in South St. Pancras and in the southern portion of East and West St. Pancras as confirmatory of the greater amount of inspection required in this neighbourhood. Judging, therefore, by the actual figures of premises and of inspections at the 70 present moment and of the actual shading of the overcrowding map based on the census figures, I beg to recommend that the areas of the twelve District Inspectors be constituted as follows:— District. Sub-Divisions. (1) N. 1 (Highgate), N. 2 (St. John's Park). (2) N. 3 (Gospel Oak), N. 4 (Grafton), and N. 5 (Maitland Park). (3) E. 1 (Bartholomew), E. 2 (Camden Square), and E. 3 (College). (4) E. 4 (Oakley Square). (5) E. 5 (Ossulston). (6) W. 1 (Castle), W. 2 (Chalk Farm). (7) W. 3 (Mornington), W. 4 (Regent's Park). (8) W. 5 (Euston). (9) S. 1 (Argyle), S. 2 (Mecklenburgh). (10) S. 3 (Burton). (11) S. 4 (Endsleigh). (12) S. 5 (Whitfield). It will be observed by referring to the overcrowding map that those districts in which the figures of premises and inspections are lowest appear on the map as more darkly shaded than some of the areas in which the premises and inspection figures are highest, so that allowance must be made for this fact, which will then make the areas appear even more equable than they are. As to Seasons and Cycles.—In addition to dwelling places requiring periodical inspection and the regular inspection of the yards of mews and stables, the District Inspectors' duties include attention to complaints, the verification of drainage plans and the supervision of drainage works, and, when time permits, house to house inspection, or inquiry, etc., in tenement streets. These duties are more or less evenly distributed throughout the year and remain approximately similar in amount from year to year. But there are certain duties which are liable to fluctuations, sometimes extreme, namely, those connected with injections diseases, inquiry, removal, disinfection, etc., and sanitary inspection and supervision of works after, etc. It must be borne in mind that during the last two years the numbers of infectious cases have been the two lowest on record, and that in the autumn of the year when the amount of cases is always greatest the Inspectors set aside their periodical work for a while until the pressure of infectious cases subsides. Additional pressure would overload several of the Inspectors in the autumn, and it is to be presumed that in case of increased pressure due to greater prevalence of infectious disease then or at any other time the Council would provide such assistance as may be found to be necessary 71 TABLE shewing probable numbers of Inspections of certain places required in each of the Sub-Divisions of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras.

The following letter, dated 4th July, 1908, was received from the Local Government Board by the Town Clerk:— "I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to the correspondence which has taken place relative to the by-laws proposed to be made by the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras with respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and as to the question of the sufficiency of the Council's staff of Sanitary Inspectors, and to state that the Board deem it desirable that a Local Inquiry in reference to both matters should be held by one of their Inspectors. "The Inquiry will take place as soon as the other engagements of the Board's Inspector will admit, and a further communication will be 73 addressed to you as to the date of the proposed Inquiry and the place at which it will be held "I am to add that the Board would he glad if the Council would instruct their officers to afford the Board's Inspector all necessary assistance in the matter." An Inquiry was accordingly held by the Inspector appointed by the Local Government Board into the by-laws proposed to be made with respect to "Houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family," at the Town Hall, on the 15th and 22nd September. The Inspector of the Board also spent eleven days inspecting premises throughout the Borough in each of the Sub-Divisions, and inquiring into the duties of each of the Sanitary Inspectors. Subsequently the following letter, dated 8th December, 1908, was received from the Local Government Board by the Town Clerk:— "I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that they have had under consideration the report of their Inspector, Dr. Sweeting, after his recent inquiry into the sufficiency of the staff of Sanitary Inspectors in the Borough of St. Pancras. The Board are of opinion that each of the two districts into which it is proposed to divide North St. Pancras is too large to be adequately supervised by one Sanitary Inspector. It appears to them that the large area of the Highgate Sub-Division and the special character of the New Town Area therein demands the services of one Inspector, and that the proposed No. 2 District consisting of three sub-divisions is too much for one Inspector. In the circumstances the Board consider that North St. Pancras should be divided as hitherto between three Inspectors, viz.:— (1) Highgate; (2) Gospel Oak and St. John's Park; (3) Maitland Park and Grafton. I am, therefore, to request that the Borough Council will be good enough to reconsider the matter with a view to the appointment of an additional Sanitary Inspector." The matter was referred to the Public Health Committee for consideration and report, and the Committee instructed the Medical Officer of Health to report to them upon the working of the Sanitary Inspectors' Districts in North St. Pancras. Accordingly, the Medical Officer of Health submitted the two following reports dated, respectively, the 9th March and 21st April, 1909:— Pursuant to the instruction of your Committee of the 27th January last, I beg to report upon and submit statistics as to the working of the Sanitary Inspectors' Districts in North St. Pancras as follows:— I reported to your Committee on the 24th June, 1908, in accordance with instructions upon the redistribution of the areas of the District Inspectors so as to cover the whole of the Borough in twelve as equable parts as possible. Of necessity this redistribution was based upon theoretical calculations of the numbers of various premises multiplied by the average numbers of inspections. 74 Sufficient time has now elapsed since the redistribution of districts in North St. Pancras to show the actual numbers of inspections of various classes of premises, etc., and to compare results in this respect. But, firstly, it is desirable to set out briefly the history of the areas of the Inspectors in North St. Pancras, and how they have been distributed. These are shown in table "A" of the Appendix. Previous to 1898 Inspector Bush had Sub-Divisions 1 and 2; Inspector Hartnoll Sub Divisions 3, 4, and 5; and Inspector Barth the Workshops, including bakehouses. Inspector Hartnoll said he found his District heavy to work, and the owners difficult to deal with. He resigned in October, 1898, to take up the post of Building Inspector at Hornsey, and Inspector Newlyn was appointed to his place in November. Inspector Newlyn did not complain but did not get through his work, took to irregular habits, and disappeared in February, 1901. In January, 1901, Inspector Dillon was appointed and succeeded Inspector Newlvn in NubDi visions 3, 4, and 5 North, and in the same year Inspector Storer was appointed to inspect Tenement Houses in the North and East Divisions of St. Pancras. Inspector Dillon found the work heavy, and in 1902 Sub-Division 3 North was transferred to Inspector Rackham, who had charge of SubDivisions 1 and 2 since 1898, and in 1903 Inspector Storer was given half Sub-Division 1 (Highgate), relieved of Tenement Houses in East St. Pancras, and confined solely to the North so as to save distance. In 1904 Inspector Barth resigned, and Inspector Dillon succeeded him as Inspector of Workshops. Inspector Brown took over Sub-Divisions 4 and 5 from Inspector Dillon, and Inspector Storer took over the rest of Sub-Division 1 from Inspector Rackham. At the end of this year the Inspectorship of Workshops and the Inspectorships of Tenement Houses were abolished, and the Workshops (including bakehouses) and the Tenement Houses were added to the District Inspectors' duties. In order to compare the work in North St. Pancras the middle of 1907 has been taken as the approximate date of Inspector Storer's departure, and the Inspections and Re-inspections have been extracted in periods of half-years for the years 1906, 1907, and 1908. The numbers of Inspections, Re-inspections, and total visits of Inspectors in North St. Pancras during each of the six halfyears, are shown in table "B." In this table it, will be seen that during each of the three half-years before the middle of 1907, the total number of visits varied from 5,323 to 5,698, and in the three same periods after the middle of 1907, they varied from 3,915 to 3,979. The Registered Tenement Houses inspected in each of the five Sub-Divisions of North St. Pancras during the six half-years under review, are set out in table " C." The deductions from this table are as follows:— (1) Of the total 426 Registered Houses in North St. Pancras during the first three half-years respectively, 169, 182, and 175 houses were not inspected, and during the last three half-years 207, 216, and 241 houses respectively were not inspected. (2) During the three half-years respectively, before Inspector Storer left the service, 53, 63, and 9 houses were not inspected in Inspector 75 Brown's District of that time; during the three half-years afterwards, 46. 83, and 116 houses were not inspected in Inspector Brown's altered District. (3) During the three first half-years 33, 1, and 42 houses were not inspected in Inspector Rackham's district of that time; during the second three half-years 161, 133, and 125 houses were not inspected in Inspector Rackham's altered District. With regard to house-to-house inspections in North St. Pancras during the last six half-years, these are set out in table "D." This table shows that in the first three half-years the house-to house inspections were done by Inspector Rackham except the 30 in the first half of 1906. Attention naturally settles on the 195 house-to-house inspections done by Inspector Rackham in the first half of 1907. If the recollection of your Committee be carried back to the beginning: of 1907 it will be remembered that early in January of that year the removal of some houses in North St. Pancras from the Register was contemplated, and the reason advanced was that as the Inspector could inspect from house-to-house registration was not necessary. This arose from the fact that just previously Inspector Rackham hud informed me that he was short of work and I had instructed him to inspect from house-to-house certain streets which had not been inspected for a long period. This appears to have given rise in the mind of your Committee that there was not sufficient work for three Inspectors in North St. Pancras. The reason Inspector Rackham imagined himself in this position appears to have been due to the fact that from the middle of February to the middle of October, a period of nine months, he did no inspections of Registered Tenement Houses, but in the last quarter of 1906 he inspected the whole of his Registered Tenement Houses, so that at the beginning of 1907 he found himself temporarily so slack of work as to be able to do 195 house-to-house inspections in the first half of 1907, and in the same half-year omitted to inspect 42 Registered Tenement Houses, the numbers of which omissions have largely increased since Mr. Storer's departure. To analyse the Registers and Returns in such detail as to exactly find the point where the misconception arose has not been a brief nor a clear task, but it is not by the Registered Tenement Houses and House-to-House Inspections alone that the amount of work to be done is to be judged. Apart from the question of distance and extent of area in North St. Pancras the figures in table "B' show that the average half-yearly number of inspections and re-inspections when there were three Inspectors was 5,559, and since there have been two Inspectors 3,939, a diminution of 1,620. Assuming 1,900 as the average number of inspections and re-inspections by each Inspector half-yearly, then 1,620 represents four-fifths of an Inspector's work short during each of toe three half-years since the middle of 1907. On the other hand, if the North Division is divided between three Inspectors, whereas the Inspector having Sub-Divisions 5 and 4, and the Inspector having Sub-Divisions 3 and 2, will have sufficient work to fully occupy their time, the Inspector having SubDivision I, although it is the largest in area of all the Inspectors' Districts in the Borough, will have the fewest probable number of inspections of all the District Inspectors (as shown in the table accompanying my Report of the 24th June, 1908) unless the new roads in Brookfield Park in the meanwhile become lined with new buildings. Of course, there are some 300 76 houses in Highgate New Town which ought in future to be inspected every half year with regularity. Table A.—NORTH ST. PANCRAS.

At the last meeting of your Committee on the 31st March, when my report of the 9th March upon the statistics as to the working of the Sanitary Inspectors' Districts in North St. Pancras was considered, members of your Committee asked me a number of questions as to the manner in which the difficulty with regard to Inspectors' Districts in North St. Pancras could bemet, and it was suggested that I should report upon the subject further. In my report of the 9th March last the statistics showed with regard to North St. Pancras that Sub-Divisions 5 and 4 (Maitland Park and Grafton) are more than sufficient for one Inspector, and Sub-Divisions 3 and 2 (Gospel Oak and St. John's Park) are also more than sufficient for one Inspector, but that Sub Division 1 (Highgate) only provides four-fifths of an Inspector's work. Disregarding the fact that the Highgate Sub-Division is straggly and very hilly, and consequently takes longer time to inspect, and that it is also possible that some little tightening might take place so as to diminish the number of re-inspections, there would still remain at the least one-half to three-quarters of an Inspector's work to be done in the Highgate Sub-Division, and the point at issue is how to provide this. 79 Is it possible that any of the other Inspectors in any of the other SubDivisions of St. Pancras could undertake the Highgate Sub-Division in addition to his own District? If reference be made to figures of the Annual Reports for 19015. 1907, and 1908, for the Inspections in the whole of St. Pancras, it will be seen that the Tenement Houses registered averaged from 2,316 to 2,271, and that of these from 2,369 to 2,592 were inspected during the year, whereas if they had been inspected in accordance with the resolutions of the Borough Council there should have been from 4,632 to 4,542 houses inspected. Similarly the Inscribed Dwellings number 166 to 198, and those inspected numbered from 93 to 309, the latter figure being in 1906 only; also, closed Underground Dwellings numbered from 591 to 478 on the register, and of these 38 to 211 were inspected, instead of being double the number of those on the register. Taking the Divisions of St. Pancras—East, West, South, and North separately, it would appear from the Inspections of table 11A of the Annual Reports during 1906, 1907, and 1908, that the Registered Tenement Houses and Inscribed Dwellings were only inspected about once instead of twice during the year. These figures would indicate that the Inspectors in the other Divisions instead of having time to take up the Highgate Sub-Division would themselves require some assistance to get through their inspections twice a year in accordance with the Council's instruction. As the indication from the statistics is that part of the time of an additional Inspector is required for Highgate 1 North Sub-Division, the question is how to provide this Inspector? One method might be the appointment of a temporary Inspector for part of the year at a smaller salary than a permanent Inspector. This probationary test would be valuable when, after an interval, it was desired to re-appoint the temporary Sanitary Inspector as if he were not satisfactory his appointment would lapse. A second method might be the appointment of a part time Inspector at a part salary, the rest of the Inspector's time being taken up by work for and paid by some other Department of the Borough Council, such as the Town Clerk's, Works, Electricity, etc., if a part time Officer is required in either of these Departments. A third method might be the appointment of a permanent whole time Sanitary Inspector at the recognised salary, one-half or three-quarters of whose time should be occupied in attending to Sub-Division 1 Highgate North, and the rest of his time acting as temporary Assistant in turn to the other Inspectors in completing their inspections of Tenement Houses and Inscribed Dwellings in their Districts. It should be brought to the notice of your Committee that during the third quarter of the year the Inspectors take their holidays, and the stall is necessarily short in number, so that if it were contemplated to appoint a temporary Inspector the beginning of the third quarter of the year would be the best time. These, in answer to the questions, are the best suggestions that I can supply for the consideration of your Committer. Your Council and Public Health Committee have the matter still under consideration. 80 HEALTH VISITORS. Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Part II., Sanitary Provisions, Section 6, sanitary authorities have been given the power to appoint suitable women as Health Visitors; the Local Government Board have been empowered to make Regulations prescribing their qualifications, mode of appointment, duties, salary, and tenure of office, and the County Council have been authorised to pay a moiety of their salaries. PUBLIC ANALYST. On account of the death of Sir Thomas Stevenson, a very old and valued Officer of St. Pancras, Mr. J. Webster was temporarily appointed Public Analyst for the Borough on the 29th July, 1908, and subsequently Mr. Edwards was temporarily appointed Public Analyst until the terms and conditions of the new permanent appointment were decided upon. On the 3rd February, 1909, Mr. J. Iiear Colwell, F.I.C., F.C.S., was appointed Public Analyst, the appointment was confirmed by the Local Government Board, and he commenced his duties on itth March, 1909. §2.-OPEN SPACES AND ATMOSPHERE.

The enclosed Gardens adjoining Regent's Park Terrace and Maitland Park Villas, are owned by adjoining owners of land, and are maintained by them. ATMOSPHERE. Smoke.—In the Annual Report for 1902 the enactments dealing with smoke were set out in full. There were 316 smoke shafts on the Register; 701 observations of these were taken, and 44 re-inspections were made after notices served. These observations or inspections and re-inspections occupy a considerable amount of time, as the intervals between stoking are of considerable duration—at least twenty minutes, and otten twice as long. The Inspectors are now instructed to limit their observation of a chimney to half-an-hour, and only to prolong it beyond this period so long as a nuisance is actually being committed. (See Minutes of Public Health Committee of 30th January, 1907.) Effluvia. —Of various businesses and places producing effluvia or offensive emanations there are 127 on the Registers, and of these 127 inspections and 47 re-inspections were made. (See also under the head of Nuisances § 9.) § 3.—DWELLINGS. (a) House-to-House Inquiries and Inspections.— (i.) For the purpose of ascertaining the mode of sub-letting, 1344 inquiries and 29 re-visits were made as to the occupation of houses in tenemented streets. (ii.) When the mode of sub-letting appears to be such as to necessitate periodical supervision of the sanitary condition of a house a complete inquiry is made into the mode of occupation of each room of the house. (iii.) When it has been decided to register a tenement house each room is measured as to its dimensions and capacity and recorded in the Register. The forms in which the reports as to these matters are made, were quoted in the Annual Report for 1904. (b) Tenement Houses — During the year 198 inspections and 212 re-inspections were made for the purpose of measuring tenement or lodging houses which it had been decided to register, and at the end of the year 2271 houses were upon the Register. Of these houses, 2592 periodical half-yearly inspections were made, and 6237 re-inspections after the service of notices. Also of the 198 dwellings entered in the Register of Inscribed Dwellings 145 inspections were made, and 181 re-inspections after the service of notices. The following is a record relating to registered tenement houses:— On Register at end of 1907 2316 Registered during 1908 9 Total 2325 Ceased to be registered houses in 1908 54 On Register at end of 1908 2271 84 BY-LAWS AS TO HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS OR TO MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. Continuing this subject from the point at which it stopped in the Annual Report for 1907, a communication dated 6th July, 1908, was received from the Local Government Board stating that a Local Inquiry would be held, upon a date hereafter to be fixed, for the purpose of considering the proposed amendments of the By-laws as to Houses Let in Lodgings or to members of more than one family. (This communication is set out under the head of Staff in the preceding "§ 1. Inspections.") The Local Government Board Inquiry was accordingly held at the Town Hall on the 15th and 22nd September, 1908, when Mr. W.T. Ricketts appeared on behalf of the St. Pancras Borough Council, and Mr. J.W. Godfrey appeared on behalf of the London County Council. The Inquiry concentrated itself upon the Exemption Clause for fixing a limit as to the class of house that should become registrable under the By-laws. The London County Council preferred to have the exemption clause swept away altogether. The Local Government Board in such By-laws have hitherto approved of an exemption clause fixing a limit of rental under which a house should become registrable. The Borough Council desired to have an exemption clause fixing a limit to the degree of sub-letting which should make houses registrable. The question at issue is two-fold; the first portion of the question is whether it is desirable to have an exemption clause, and if this is answered in the affirmative the second portion of the question is whether the limit should be a limit of rent or a limit of habitable accommodation. The following communication has since the Inquiry been received from the Local Government Board:— Local Government Board, 133, 153. C. 1908. Whitehall, s.w. 31st March, 1909. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to the Local Inquiry held by their Inspector, Dr. Sweeting, with respect to the amendments proposed to be made by the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras in the by-laws with respect to Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family in force in the Borough. The Board have had their Inspector's Report under consideration, together with the considerable body of evidence adduced at the Inquiry, and the information obtained by Dr. Sweeting by personal investigations as to the practical effect of the proposed exemption clause in various parts of the Borough. Having regard to the information thus acquired the Board have been compelled to arrive at the conclusion that, under the proposed by-law, on the one hand many houses which are of a class not needing regulation on sanitary grounds would come within the operation of the by-laws, and on the other hand a very large number of houses in respect of which regulation is necessary,—estimated by Dr. Sweeting at half the total number of this class,—would be exempted. It appears certain too that this undesirable result would obtain not only in regard 85 to particular areas in the Borough, but even in parts of the same street and in houses side by side. In these circumstances the Board feel that they would not be justified in confirming a series of by-laws embodying the form of exemption proposed. The Board would be glad if they could offer for the Council's consideration a form of exemption which would promise a reasonable solution of the difficulty. They have always attached considerable importance in the framing of by-laws dealing with this subject to the exclusion from their operations of houses let in lodgings of the superior type, the regulation of which on sanitary grounds is unnecessary. In many of the London Boroughs this object has been practically attained by the adoption of a by-law providing for the exemption of houses in cases where the rent payable by each lodger exceeds certain specified limits, and the information before the Board leads them to think that in ordinary circumstances a carefully framed clause of this nature works reasonably well. The Board understand from Dr. Sweeting that the by-laws at present in force, numbered 2 and 3, under which the preliminary registration of houses is required are found by the Borough Council to involve prolonged discussion at Committee meetings in order to determine what houses are to be brought within the scope of the by-laws. Apart from this the London County Council take objection to by-laws in this form, and the Board have not for several years past assented to such by-laws. In these circumstances the Board feel that the Council would do well to repeal the by-laws in question, and to take into consideration the question of substituting a series based on the Board's present model with an exemption clause depending on rental limits similar to that contained in the model. Possiblv in view of the different character of different parts of the Borough it might be advisable to divide it into two or more areas, with different rental limits in different areas. Copies of the draft forms to be used for this purpose are enclosed herewith. The Board are aware from your letter of the 11th October, 1907, that a proposal to adopt a by-law on the lines of the model has received some consideration, and they are also aware that the question of a rental exemption clause has also been carefully considered by the Council and their advisers, but the Board are not sure that the Council have reached a final conclusion that no such clause could be framed to meet the special circumstances of the Borough. If after a further consideration of the model code the Borough Council are still unable to decide that an exemption clause on the lines of model clause 2 would be practicable in the circumstances of the Borough, the Board can only suggest that the Council might consider the question of adopting a suitable series without any exemption clause. Such a code of by-laws would require to be very carefully drawn so as to avoid imposing any objectionably harsh requirements on lodging houses of the better class. The Council might refer to the by-laws in this form made by the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn in 1903. It must, however, be borne in mind that the Holborn by-laws were based on a series already in force and might now need modification, particularly in the sense indicated by clause 19 of the Board's revised model, which has been framed to meet the decisions in the cases of Nokes v. Islington Metropolitan 86 Borough Council. [(No. 1). ((1904) 1 K.B. 610; 73 L.J.K.B. 100; 90 LT. 22; 52 W.R. 399; 68 JP. 95; 20 T.L.R. 95; 2 L.G.R. 334), and Stiles v. Galinski and Nokes v. Islington M.B.C. (No. 2) ((1904) 1 K.B. 615; 73 L.J.K.B. 485; 90 L.T. 437; 52 W.R. 462; 68 J.P. 183; 20 T.L.R. 219; 2 L.G.R 341)]. The Board will be happy to consider any further proposals of the Borough Council to deal with this matter. A statement is enclosed briefly indicating the exemption clauses in force in other Metropolitan Boroughs where by-laws as to Houses let in Lodgings have been confirmed during recent years. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (signed) J.S. DAVY, Assistant Secretary. To the Town Clerk, St. Pancras.

Southwark M.B.C. Every house let in lodgings shall be exempt from the operation of these by-laws in which every letting shall be— (a) At a rent of not less than 7/6 per week exclusive of any charge for the use by the lodger of any furniture; or (b) At a rent of not less than 10/6 per week inclusive of any charge for the use by the lodger of any furniture.

Finsbury M.B.C. "In the following case a lodging house shall be exempt from the operation "of these by-laws." "When the landlord resides upon the premises and the letting by such " landlord is to not more than one lodger." 88 Battersea M.B.C. "A lodging house shall be exempt from the operation of these by-laws where "the keeper resides on the premises and where in addition to such keeper and " his family there are not more than three persons lodging in such house." The above communication does not say that a limit of habitable accommodation is an undesirable form of exemption, but simply that the particular manner in which the limit of habitable accommodation proposed by the Borough Council has been framed and worded, exempts certain houses which in the opinion of the Local Government Board should not be exempted. There is no difficulty in framing a limit or limits of habitable accommodation in such a manner as to comply with the desire of the Local Government Board to include all those houses in respect of which the Local Government Board is of opinion that regulation is necessary. In due course such exemption clauses will be submitted for the consideration of the Public Health Committee. INSCRIBED DWELLINGS. For the purpose of periodical inspection a List of Inscribed Dwellings is kept. This List includes :— 1. Cottages of one, two, three, or more rooms occupied by one family and which cannot be registered, e.g., Equity Buildings. 2. Duellings over Stables which require periodical inspection, but cannot be registered, e.g., Wakefield Mews. 3. Houses in certain areas represented under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, some of which are registrable and some not, e.g., Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place areas. 4. Tenemeut Houses let in separate duellings, but in which the dwellings are not separately assessed, or, if separately assessed, in which the dwellings do not differ in arrangement or construction from those in an ordinary tenement house, and which, it may be contended, are not registrable. 5. Working-class flats habitually overcrowded or kept in an insanitary condition. Water supply to tenement-houses.—Section 78 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, with reference to the supply of water to tenement houses, provides that for the purposes of section 48 (provision as to houses without proper water supply) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a tenement house shall be deemed to be a house without a proper and sufficient supply of water unless there shall be provided on the storey or one of the storeys in which the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of the family occupying such house are situate a sufficient provision for the supply of water for domestic purposes. 89 The section came into operation on the 1st January, 1908, and a communication was received from the London County Council, asking whether th Act has proved beneficial to the occupants of the houses to which it applies i this Borough. As, however, no notices have, as yet, been served by this Authority under the section in question, the London County Council have been informed that no particulars of its working can be given them. Your Council resolved on the '29th July, 1908, that no action be taken in the matter. Cooking accommodation to tenement-houses.—Section 7, Part II. Sanitary Provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, empowers the Sanitary Authority to require sufficient and suitable accommodation for the cooking of food to be provided for each family occupying a tenement-house newly used or occupied as such after the passing of the Act, a tenement-house meaning a house occupied by persons of the working class, and wholly or partially let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. (c) Underground Dwellings.—At the end of the year there were on the Register 591 underground rooms which had been illegally occupied as dwellings, and had been ordered to be closed, and of which 211 inspections had been made, and 23 re-inspections after notices served. Time is allowed to the occupants of these rooms to find rooms elsewhere, and during the time allowed the illegally occupied rooms are kept under observation, and the number vacated or otherwise occupied ascertained and reported. The houses in which these dwellings are found are added to the register of registered tenement houses. (d) Common Lodging House.—There are 19 Registered Common Lodging Houses in St. Pancras, and these are supervised by the London County Council, including the one Salvation Army Shelter in South St. Pancras. Rowton Houses are not so registered; of these there are in St. Pancras, one at the southern end of King's Cross Road in South St. Pancras, and another at the northern end of Arlington Road in West St. Pancras. (e) Canal Boat Dwellings.— During the year, 79 visits of inspection were paid to the 31 wharves on the Regent's Canal. (f) Working Class Flats.—A list of the principal of these and the accommodation provided will be found in the Appendix to this Report. THE AIRING, THROUGH-BLOW OR THROUGH-VENTILATION, OF WORKING-CLASS FLATS. In connection with the application to the London County Council for a certificate under Section 7 of the London Building Acts (Amendment) Act, 1905, that the requirements thereof have been complied with in the construction of the buildings at Flaxman Terrace, the District Surveyor raised points, arising out of which the Medical Officer of Health presented the following report to the Public Health Committee on the 2nd December, 1908:— " I beg to call the attention of your Committee to certain of the requirements of the District Surveyors and of the Building Acts Department of the 90 London County Council in regard to fire. The requirements in question are those demanding in houses constructed in flats of fire resisting materials, that on the staircases the front doors of the flats shall be automatically closing, and that the fanlights over such doors shall be fixed, the effect of which is that no airing of a flat dwelling can be obtained through the door or fanlight on the staircase. "Your Committee approved of plans for dwellings on the Brantome Place Area, now known as Flaxman Terrace, one of the conditions of which approval was that the dwellings should be capable of being aired or blown through in the morning after having been closed up during the night. This airing or 'through blow' of air (of which the term 'through ventilation' conveys an utterly inadequate conception) can only be obtained from one front of a building through to another front. If the 'through blow' has to be obtained within the dwelling or flat itself and not off the staircase outside the flat, this restricts the conditions of construction to such an extent that only two dwellings or flats can be designed on each floor, and this mode of construction is costly. Economy demands four fiats on each floor, and compels two of the four flats to be so constructed that all the rooms must be on one front, as was the case in the back to back houses which were condemned on this site and which these flats have displaced. No 'airing' or 'through blow' is possible in a one-fronted dwelling or flat where the openings are all on one side, as it is physically impossible for the wind to blow out of the same opening as it blows into, and the only way of obtaining a 'through blow' is by an opening on the other side of the building. For one-fronted flats this 'through blow' can only be obtained by means of the front door with fanlight over through the common staircase to an opening in the outer wall on the other side of the staircase. The reason given for the requirement of the London County Council is that if a fire occurred in a flat the smoke might fill the staircase. I venture to suggest that the remedy is to require the staircase to be more open to the air. "A horizontal arcade, even when only reaching to the first floor level, is a notoriously unhealthy mode of construction unless it is short and fully open to the air at the sides or ends, and a vertical arcade such as the common staircase of a house constructed in flats is an equally unhealthy form of construction unless there be sufficient openings to allow of ample and permanent communication with the open air. The best way to remedy a draught is to make the openings larger without necessarily going to the extreme of removing the whole of the enclosing arcade so as to make it vertically or horizontally an open street. "I beg to recommend that a representation be made to the Public Health Department of the London County Council calling their attention to the fact that the requirements under the London Building Acts—means of escape in case of fire—as to the complete closure or closability of common staircases of buildings constructed in flats, and of the front doors of such flats and fanlights over, on such staircases are obstructive of the airing or through blow or through ventilation of dwellings and conducive to the increase of consumption in the Metropolis." This was approved by your Council on 16th December, 1908, and a resolution adopted to send a copy of the Report to the London County Council. 91 THE INLAND REVENUE ACT, 1903. Houses during the Year 1908. Tenements. Notes. No. comprised therein. No. for which Certificates were Granted. Refused. Deferred. 8 56 26 — 30 (g.)— HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS. Part I. Area No. 1. —Somers Town. 1 (a).—Churchway Scheme.—In continuation of the previous Annual Reports on the subject of housing, this scheme was completed by the London County Council; the other schemes are moving as described here following. 1 (b).—Part of area west of Chalton Street and north of Drummond Street line.—The houses in this area were dealt with individually under the Public Health Act years ago. 1 (c).—Part of area east of Chalton Street.— In continuance of the history of the Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place Schemes. The Schemes of 1898, amended in 1901, relating to those two areas were embodied in one Order by the Local Government Board, and a notice thereof published in the “London Gazette.” The Midland Railway Company having acquired the land in 1898, petitioned against the Order in December, 1905, as did also a leaseholder, and the Order of the Local Government Board sanctioning and embodying the schemes became “provisional.” On the 17th February, 1906, the directors of the Midland Railway Company, by letter, suggested that the Borough Council should endeavour to find another site for the erection of the new buildings for rehousing persons proposed to be disturbed under this scheme. The Local Government Board introduced a Bill into the House of Commons entitled "An Act to confirm a Provisional Order of the Local Government Board relating to the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras.” This Act was passed on the 4th August, 1906. It is provided in the Act (section 1) that “the Order set out in the schedule hereto shall be and the same is hereby confirmed and all the provisions thereof shall have full validity and force as from a date to be fixed by an Order of the Local Government Board, not being less than twelve months from the passing of this Act.” Areas Nos. 2 and 3. Prospect Terrace and Brantone Place Order.—In the Order the number of persons to be displaced from these two areas is 1,165, and the number to be 92 housed on the three sites scheduled in the Order is 842 persons. The position with regard to the three sites is as follows :— (a) Great College Street Site—On this additional vacant site included in the Order of the Local Government Board for the purpose of housing part of the persons displaced from the Brantome Place and Prospect Terrace areas, Goldington Buildings were erected and opened in 1904, and are fully occupied. These buildings were described under the head ôf (f) Working Class Flats in the Annual Report for 1905, n. 108, and accommodate 332 persons, or 10 more than required on this site by the Order of the Local Government Board. (b) Brantome Place Area.— In continuation of the course of events recorded in the Report for 1907, on 8th July, 1908, the Borough Council resolved that the buildings being erected on the Brantome Place and North Crescent Mews site should be named Flaxman Terrace. On the 29th July the Borough Council fixed the rentals as shown in this table:— Brantome Place Buildings (Flaxman Terrace). Rooms in Tenements. Floor. Two. Three. Total number of Tenements. Ground First 12 16 28 Second Third 12 16 28 Fourth Fifth 12 16 28 Total 36 48 84 Rentals. Floor. Rent of each of tworoom Tenements. Rent of each of threeroom Tenements. Ground First 8s. 6d. 11s. 6d. Second Third 7s. 6d. 10s. 6d. Fourth Fifth 6s. 6d. 9s. 6d. Weekly Rental. £ s. d. Two-room tenements 13 10 0 Three-room tenements 25 4 0 £38 14 0 93 In addition, the rent of twelve of the end tenements to he increased by one shilling per week on account of the excellent position and size of the rooms, and the rents of six of the flank tenements to be reduced by one shilling per week, inasmuch as the rooms are somewhat at dark. This will have the effect of increasing the gross weekly rental of £38 14s., shown in the foregoing table, to £39 per week. The buildings contain 48 three-room dwellings and 36 two-room dwellings, in all 2l6 rooms, intended to house 432 persons, in 84 self-contained dwellings. On the 29th October, 1908, Flaxman Terrace was formally opened by His Worship the Mayor, Councillor Alfred Mills, J.P., and within a few weeks was fully occupied. (c.) Prospect Terrace Area.—An Inquiry was held by Edgar Dudley Esq., F.S.I., an Inspector appointed by the Local Government Board, at the Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W., on Monday, the 24th August last, with regard to the application of the St. Pancras Borough Council to the Local Government Board for the issue of an Order permitting the Council to further modify the Scheme in regard to the Prospect Terrace area by the substitution of three hundred and fifty-two for one hundred and forty-four as the number of persons for whom suitable dwellings are to be erected on the Prospect Terrace area. Under Article 3a of the Order of the Local Government Board of the 7th December, 1901, suitable dwellings, according to plans to be prepared by the Borough Council and agreed upon between them and the London County Council, were to be erected on the Brantome Place area for the accommodation of 430 persons of the working classes, on the Prospect Terrace area a for the accommodation of 144, and on the Great College Street site for 322 persons. 432 persons had been provided for upon the Brantome Place area, and 322 upon the Great College Street site. With regard to the 144 persons to be accommodated on the Prospect Terrace area the Borough Council desired to provide for 352 persons on this site. Under Article 14 of the 1901 Order, it was provided that half of each area should be cleared before the other half be constructed. This part of the Older was departed from by the Borough Council, the London County Council consenting. Goldington Buildings were erected on the Great College Street site before the Brantome Place area was clcared, and it was deemed advisable to clear the whole of the Brantone Place area before clearing the Prospect Terrace area. Before the buildings on the Brantome Place area could be completed, owing to the delays caused by the negotiations with the Skinners Company (between March, 19 2, and November, 1903, before the confirmation of the Order by the Local Government Board, and subsequent to the confirmation between July, 1905, and July, 1906), the Prospect Terrace property became unfit for human habitation, and the Borough Council having found by enquiry that there was abundance of vacant housing accommodation in the vicinity, decided to give the tenants all information with regard to the accommodation available, and to give them notice to quit the premises, and to demolish the houses on the Prospect Terrace area. In 1907, when the Brantome Place Buildings were well advanced, the plans attached to the Scheme and Order of the Local Government Board of 94 the 7th December, 1901, in regard to the Prospect Terrace Area, were reconsidered by the Borough Council, and objection was raised on the ground that the Buildings would not pay, and that they consisted of associated instead of self-contained dwellings. On the 5th June, 1907, the Borough Council decided to approve and adopt the plans prepared by Messrs. Joseph and Smithem in substitution of those previously made, and on the 31st July, 1907, the Borough Council presented the estimate showing expenses, £1,592 per annum ; and receipts, £1,598 per annum, in respect of the Dwellings proposed to be erected on the Prospect Terrace Area in accordance with the plans of Messrs. Joseph and Smithem. On the 26th February, 1908, the Borough Council resolved to issue advertisements for tenders for the building. On the 17th June, 1908, the Borough Council accepted the tender of Mr. F. G. Minter, of Putney, for the erection of the buildings at £16,208; the tender of Stuart's Granolithic Company, for the artificial stonework, at £1,292 16s. 9d ; and the tender of the St. Pancras Ironwork Company, at £125, for the ironwork, etc. On the 28th July, 1908, the London County Council formally approved the plans, and on the 1st August, 1908, wrote stating that they had decided to sanction the borrowing of the money under part 2 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, provided that the approval of the Local Government Board was obtained before proceeding further. Mr. Joseph, of Messrs. Joseph and Smithem, gave reasons for varying the plans of the buildings to be erected on the Prospect Terrace area. The earlier Scheme would not have paid its way, and part of the land shown as belonging to the Borough Conncil did not so belong, and would have interfered with the compliance of the London Building Act; further, the dwellings were associated and were only three floors high. In the new Scheme the dwellings are self-contained, are six stories high, and have a block of 12 bath rooms, etc., attached, and will house 352 persons, instead of 144, and at practically the same rents, although the Borough Pate has increased from 6s. 8d. to 7s. 1d. in the £, and the water rate from 4 per cent, to 5 per cent, on the rateable value; and the size of the rooms also compares favourably. The original plans showed about 2in. of concrete under the walls, whereas the present have 15in., because the foundations were found to be very bad. Cost per cubic foot 8¾d. The cost of the land of the Scheme was £5,600, cost of land per room £31 16s. 0d., and under the old Scheme it would have been £77 15s. 0d. The total cost per room will be £92 10s. 0d., and under the old Scheme £110 15s. 3d. The Local Government Board consented to the application, and made an amended Order, dated 19th November, 1908, and the buildings are now in course of erection. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS. Part II.— Single Houses. In the case of individual houses, efforts are made to exhaust the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to remedy defects, before resorting to the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and amending Acts, except when it is obvious that no remedy short of demolition and reconstruction is available. Sandhills Estate.–Medical Officer of Health reported to the Public Health Committee of the 11th March on the conditions of the Sandhills Estate, 95 and the Report was forwarded to the Skinners Company for their information. The main subject matter of the Report was as follows:— " With the desire of assisting the Skinners Company in improving the Sandhills Estate, the past, present, and future conditions if clearly recorded will enable sound judgments to be formed as to public requirements, and the interests both of the owners and the possible occupiers of the houses. “The Skinners’ Estate in St. Pancras, commencing at the Euston Road end of Mabledon Place, includes the area bounded roughly by, and including the houses on both sides of, Brantome Place (as it formerly existed), Burton Street, Leigh Street, Judd Street, Tonbridge Street, and Euston Road, south side only, back to Mabledon Place. Within this area are wholly or partially embraced some fourteen streets, containing some 480 or more houses, of which more than one-third are upon the Register of Houses let in Lodgings. It is very doubtful whether any alteration of name of street only will induce tenants to take houses in this part of London to be occupied only by one family, such being the mode of construction and arrangement of these houses, and the mode of equipment with domestic and sanitary conveniences. The day for securing this class of tenants in this part of London is past. “Judging by estates to the south of the Sandhills Estate, the leases on which have also expired within recent years, the whole house single family tenants have nearly all gone away, and the changes that have taken place have been (1) letting the houses in shops and offices, (2) letting the houses as good class furnished lodging and boarding houses, (3) adaptation of the houses into selfcomplete flats, and (4) reconstruction in self-contained flats with or without shops beneath. In reference to each of these changes:— “(1) The neighbourhood is now fairly well supplied with shops and offices. “(2) As it is the greater number of the guests that can be accommodated which enables the good class furnished lodging house and boarding house to pay its way in the face of the keen competition in this neighbourhood, it follows that single houses let as lodging houses will be too small and will inevitably fail to secure a good class of tenant and raise themselves above the tenement house condition in which they have been. This will necessitate periodical inspection as hitherto and possibly the addition of more houses to the register. That this is the probable destiny of many of the empty houses is evidenced by the fact that thay have bills in the windows announcing ‘Floor to let’—presumably this means that it is the definite intention to let these houses in floors. If so it may in future become necessary to consider (a) whether these houses should be registered for periodical inspection (b) whether the Borough Council is bound by Section 78, London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, to close the houses as unfit for human habitation unless they are provided with a proper and sufficient supply of water on each floor, which will also imply the provision of a proper sink and waste pipe, (c) whether Clause 20, London 96 County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908, requiring proper and sufficient cooking accommodation in each dwelling will apply to these houses, and further, (d) if the sink fixed under the water supply tap on each floor, as required above, be used for slops and urine, and becomes a nuisance by reason of the great distance of the W.C., whether the only means of abating the nuisance will be also to provide a slop or other closet on each floor. (3) The changes enumerated in the previous paragraph suggest the desirability of serious consideration, and whether the difficulties would not be more easily overcome, and a better class of tenant immediately secured by adapting the houses forthwith into flats, in such a manner as to provide domestic and sanitary conveniences on each floor, so as to make them self-complete although not selfcontained. This might possibly wipe away at one stroke all the difficulties enumerated in the previous paragraph and improve the status of the property so much desired both by the Skinners Company and the Council. With regard to the letting of flats, floors, or rooms for immoral purposes, the prevention of this in any class of house is a matter of good management and not of mode of construction or equipment. (4) Reconstruct ion in flats, or in the horizontal rather than the vertical type of dwelling house is the form of reconstruction of dwelling houses taking place in this part of London, but so long as the main walls of a house are sound presumably adaptation will be resorted to rather than reconstruction at the present time. The County Council special provisions with regard to fire do not appear to apply to ordinary sized dwelling houses adapted to be occupied in separate dwellings, but in the case of large premises doubtless the Borough Council would support any reasonable appeal to the County Council in favour of the Skinners Company in endeavouring to improve the Sandhills Estate. In conclusion, by thus setting out fully the difficulties that may probably arise in the future it will be possible to take measures to avoid some and to provide a remedy for others, and so benefit both public and private interests." § 4.—SCHOOLS. At the 42 grant receiving schools 60 inspections were made during the year by the Woman Inspector. The Board of Education decided to relieve Local Authorities from the obligation to provide school places for children nnder the age of five years, the age at which compulsory school attendance begins; and many Authorities are ceasing to admit school children from 3-5 years of age. § 5.—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. Factories.—The Men Inspectors had 397 and the Woman Inspector 108 factories upon the Registers for periodical inspection as to water service. 97 sanitary conveniences, drainage, and nuisances. During the year 114 and 48 inspections of factories, respectively, were made, and 20 re-inspections after notices served. Workshops.—The Men Inspectors had 1028 (apart from bakehouses) and the Woman Inspector 385 workshops (apart from laundries) on the Registers for periodical inspection. During the year 670 and 148 inspections, respectively, of these premises were made, and 304 and 1 re-inspections after notices. Workplaces.—These include restaurant kitchens, cab and omnibus yards, laundries and domestic workshops, and home workplaces. Domestic Workshops and Home Workplaces.—The Woman Inspector has 69 of these on the Register, of which 33 inspections and 0 re-inspections after notice were made. These places vary in number from year to year, and according to the season of the year. Laundries.—On the Register arc 74 laundries at which the Woman Inspector made 33 inspections and 1 re-inspection. Restaurant Kitchens.—Of these the Men Inspectors had 141 and the Woman Inspector 158 on the Registers. At the former 156 inspections and 52 re-inspections were made and at the latter 52 inspections and 0 re-inspections. Bakehouses.—At the commencement of the year there were 173 workshopbakehouses. Of these and of the three factory bakehouses, and the three bakehouses in hotels, 336 inspections and 251 re-inspections were made.

They refer to women only with the exception of about 120 men working in their own homes. In addition to the matters dealt with as shown in the above table, I handed over to the District Inspectors four cases involving drain construction. In addition to the two cases of infectious diseases in home workers' premises, shown in the appended table, a case of scabies was found in the family of a home-worker. There was no difficulty in inducing the family to take precautions, and the patient soon recovered. 100 Two of the consumptives notified were in the families of home-workers. As in previous years, I have continued to take an interest in the dirty and neglected children of the district Poverty and ignorance, more frequently than deliberate neglect, account for the condition of these children, and encouragement and teaching, together with a sympithetic interest in the family as a whole, seem more adapted than do punitive measures to give results of permanent value for the life of the children. The greater part of the year has been given to work arising from the voluntarily notified cases of consumption. On this subject I submit to you a separate report. The question of home work has a special interest at this moment in view of the movement for the regulation of the wages of home-workers. This movement, whatever view may be taken of the desirability of the proposed measures, is a welcome recognition of the fact that the deplorable condition of many home-workers is rather the result of economic causes than of any special laxity of sanitary administration. In this district we have very little of the worst class of home work, and there is rarely any occasion to interfere with the home-workers' conditions. In so far as they are undesirable, they are neither more nor less so than those of other persons of the same earning capacity. The home-workers themselves in our district are an industrious and deserving class. Some work at home because they are not young enough or not strong enough for factory conditions. Others work at home so as to supervise their families, and at the same time to earn some contribution to the support of parents or children. Others again work so as to keep in touch with the industrial world, and to keep their deftness of touch and general skill unimpaired. In the uncertainty of men's employment precaution of this kind on the part of married women out-workers is not without justification. Possibly these workers, who are not entirely dependent on their earnings from outwork may tend to bring down wages and so to injure those who work for their livelihood, but occasionally their partial independence enables them to refuse unfair terms, probably with good effect. The usual clerical work accompanying the work of inspection, including notices, notifications, reports, registers, etc., etc., has been done. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, M. E.

As stated in the previous Annual Report, a Conference of representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils, convened by St. Pancras, was held on the 24th June, 1907, to consider the question of combined drainage. The Conference appointed a Committee with instructions to prepare, for presentation to the President of the Local Government Board, a Petition or Draft Bill dealing with the law relating to combined drainage. At a subsequent meeting of the Conference the Committee submitted their report and draft Bill which was amended as regards the definition of the word "drain," and as so amended was approved. It was then decided to ask the Parliamentary representatives of the Metropolitan Boroughs to support and co-operate in the promotion of the Bill through the various stages of Parliament. The Members of Parliament were communicated with accordingly. The Bill was read a first time in the House of Common", and was down for second reading, but no progress was made. To some extent this is due to the fact that it is extremely difficult, and almost in- 106 possible, for a private Member to successfully legislate without the co-operation of the responsible Minister of His Majesty's Government. In these circumstances a letter was addressed to the several Borough Councils asking them to communicate with the President of the Local Government Board, urging the desirability of the Government taking charge of the Bill, or granting facilities for its passage into law during the Session of Parliament, and it is gratifying that almost all the Borough Councils made representations to the President on these lines. It is interesting to refer to the amounts paid during the past few years by this Authority in repairing or reconstructing sewers due to combined drainage. In 1902 3 it was £5361 8s. 0d.; in 1903-4, £4001 12s. 5d.; in 1904-5, £1998 17s. 5d.; in 1905-6, £1489 2s. 7d.; in 1906-7, £1458 3s. 1d.; and in 1907-8, £546 1s. 7d. From 1899 to 1908 no less a sum than £24,508 15s. 7d. has been paid by this Authority on account of this work which in the nine years involved the ratepayers of the Metropolis in the expenditure of about £250,000. The Bill approved by the Conference for amending the law, if passed by Parliament, would relieve the ratepayers of the expense of repairing or reconstructing drains which have been combined, very often surreptitiously, upon private premises, and the expense would then very properly fall upon the owners of the premises. A complete Report upon this subject by the Chief Clerk of the Public Health Department, was published as a separate Report in June, 1908. § 8.—STORAGE AND REMOVAL OF OFFENSIVE MATTERS. CLEANSING AND SCAVENGING. Salting Snow.—Unmelted snow may lie for days and become so compressed by treading and rolling as to become dangerous to both foot and wheeled traffic, whereas salting will enable the traffic to be rapidly freed if it is promptly followed by sweeping. The object of salting snow is to melt it quickly so that it may be easily swept into the gutters, whence it can run away as a liquid through the street gulleys into the sewers. A layer of freshly-fallen snow an inch deep, spread with powdered salt, will melt in a few minutes, and, if the spreading be followed by sweeping, a thoroughfare may be quickly cleared. The essential point in the use of salt is that the snow shall be promptly swept away within a short time of salting. If there is delay in the sweeping there is reason for serious complaint by the public, because the addition of salt to snow makes the resultant mixture much colder than ordinary ice-water, and, being much morepenetrating in the liquid than in the solid form, acts as a freezing mixture to the feet of man and animals. The conclusion is that no salting of snow should take place unless and until preparation has been made to follow it up shortly by sweeping. 107 § 9.—NUISANCES, &c. Regent's Canal Water.—Specimens of water taken from various parts of the Regent's Canal within the Borough were sent for analysis to the Public Analyst. The general tone of his reports was that the water was sewage polluted, but that the contamination was not such as to cause a nuisance. Offensive Trades.—The two licensed noxious trade premises in St. Pancras have been regularly inspected, and the fallow melting works in Tudor Place have been kept under repeated observations. Effluria Businesses.—In addition to the above businesses producing offensive effluvia, the businesses of a vendor of fried fish, a fish-curer, and a rag and bone dealer have been brought under control by Section 10, Part II., Sanitary Provisions, of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. By this section the County Council may make by-laws for regulating the conduct of these businesses, and with respect to the premises, utensils, and appliances used in connection with these businesses, and it is the duty of the Borough Councils to enforce these by-laws. For the text of the Section of the Act see Part VI., Legislation, of this Annual Report. § 10— SUMMONSES. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (except in respect of Food).

V.-FOOD. § 1.—FOOD PREMISES. The dairies, cowsheds, and milkshops, the slaughterhouses, the places where foods are prepared, and the marketing places have been regularly visited and inspected. The market and marketing streets have also been regularly visited on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. Two cowshed premises situated at 4a, Little Albany Street, and 33, Longford Street, both occupied by Edwin Jennings, have ceased to be used for the keeping of cows ; the former was licensed for 12 cows and the latter for 20. Bakehouses, restaurant kitchens, and similar workplaces where food is prepared are also controlled by the Factory and Workshop Acts, and have been dealt with under Part IV. Food Premises generally.—By the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1906, Part II., Sanitary Provisions, section 8, a number of sanitary provisions are made to apply to any room, shop, or other place in which any article for the food of man is sold, or is exposed, deposited, or prepared for sale. The provisions embrace sanitary conveniences, cisterns, drains, sleeping places, refuse, and cleanliness, with penalties for non-compliance. (See Part VI., Legislation.) 110 Dairy Premises.—By the same Act and Part, section 5, power is given to sanitary authorities to remove from or to refuse to register dairymen whose premises are unsuitable for the sale of milk thereon. (See Part VI., Legislation.) Food Effluvia Businesses.—By the same Act and Part, section 9, power is given to the County Council to make By-laws for regulating the conduct of the business and the premises and appliance of a vendor of fried fish, a fish curer, and a rag and bone dealer. The last deals in materials which are foods or discarded remnants of foods. It is the duty of the Sanitary Authorities to enforce these By-laws within their respective Boroughs. (See Part VI., Legislation.) § 2.-UNWHOLESOME FOOD. Nursery Milks.—As in previous years during the month of July, in accordance with the resolution of the Council, thirty samples of nursery milks were obtained and examined bacteriologically and chemically. In each case half-apint of milk was purchased, and drawn or poured directly into a bottle provided by the Inspector, such bottle having been previously thoroughly cleansed and repeatedly rinsed with hot and cold clean water, and a cork tied round the neck thoroughly sterilised, by high pressure of steam and hot air current, in a disinfecting chamber and corked in the chamber before being removed. These bottles after cooling were packed in ice in a portable metal case holding four bottles at a time, and were carried to the places where specimens of milk were procured, and when filled and numbered were forthwith taken to the Laboratories at Guy's Hospital and the bacteriological and chemical examinations were immediately commenced. The result of the sampling and examinations are contained in a tabulated form in the Tables below, lettered “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D.” “A” shows the price and source of the sample of nursery milk purchased; " B " results of the bacteriological examinations of the samples; “C,” results of the chemical examination; and “D” results of further sampling and analysis under the sale of Food and Drugs Acts of the unsatisfactory samples in Table “C.” Dr. Eyre reported with regard to the bacteriological examinations in Appendix “B” as follows:- “The milk samples examined in 1908, as compared with those of the previous “year, are only slightly less ‘dirty’ so far as concerns the volume of apparent “filth. (See Table I.).” TABLE I. Volume of apparent filth. 1907. 1908. Below 200 volumes 63.3 63.3 Between 250 and 500 volumes 20.0 2.66 Above 500 volumes 16.6 10.0 111 " When, however, one considers the bacterial contents per cubic centimetre " as the test of cleanliness, the 1908 samples (owing no doubt to the higher " atmospheric temperature of the month of July, 1908, as compared with the " corresponding month of the previous year) were distinctly inferior to those " of 1907, as will be seen from the following Table :- TABLE II. Bacteria per cc. 1907 samples. Per cent. 190S samples. Per cent. Under 1 million 9 30.0 10 33.3 Between 1 and 100 millions 19 63.3 11 36.6 Over 100 millions 2 6.6 9 30.0 " and it is of interest to note that those samples which chemically showed " evidence of the addition of water or the abstraction of cream were bacterio" logically dirty milks. " When we compare the results of the microscopical examination of the " centrifugalised deposit with those reported last year it will be found that pus " cells were present in much smaller numbers than previously; streptococci " were observed four times, but acid fast bacilli (including tubercle bacilli) " were apparently absent. " One specimen only gave rise to the suspicion that a tuberculous lesion " was responsible for the appearance of pus in the milk, but as no animal " inoculation was performed in this case confirmatory evidence is lacking." With regard to the chemical examinations in Tables " C " and " D) " it will be observed that at the first examination the result of the chemical analysis of No. 5 sample was reported as " deficiency in milk solids other than milk fats corresponds to the presence of six per cent. added water," and upon a subsequent sample taken from the same vendor the result of the chemical examination was reported as " deficiency in milk solids other than milk fats corresponds to the presence of seven per cent. added water," and in this case it was decided to prosecute. The case was heard, the defendant pleaded a warranty, and the magistrate dismissed the case. 112 TABLE A. The Prick and Source of the Specimens. Consecutive No. Inspector's Numbering.

ADDENDUM. Sample No. 30 was milk drawn from a cow directly into a sterilised bottle. The report of the Bacteriologist on this sample was that the volume of apparent filth was 1000 parts per million consisting entirely of pus cells, and the report of the chemist showed that the milk fat and the total solids were the highest of the 30 samples of nursery milk examined bacteriologically and chemically. This sample of milk was taken from the cow in the cow-shed from which tuberculous infected milk was taken last year and authority was given to take further samples of milk for analysis from the cow-shed in question. Samples were taken from the 10 cows in this cow-shed and submitted to Dr. Eyre for bacteriological analysis. The results of these examinations are contained in the following Table:— 120 No. Volume of apparent filth per million. Nature of filth.* Re-action. Degree of acidity per cent.

It will be noticed that four of the cows out of the 10 showed an excessive amount of pus in the milk and the probability is that some chronic form of inflammation exists in the udders of these cows set up by excessive stripping habitually practised in order to stimulate and increase the supply of milk from the cows. These are the kind of udders that are likely to become infected with tubercle bacilli, and where the bacilli find lodgment if they have not already done so. Copies of these reports were sent to the Local Government Board and the London County Council. 121 HUMAN AND ANIMAL TUBERCULOSIS. Extract from the Third Interim Report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the relation of HUMAN and ANIMAL TUBERCULOSIS. In our Second Interim Report we expressed the opinion, as the result of our investigations, that a very considerable amount of disease and loss of life, especially among infants and children, must be attributed to the consumption of cow's milk containing tubercle bacilli. Tuberculosis involving the udder is comparatively common in cows, and in such cases their milk always contains tubercle bacilli and is therefore dangerous for human beings consuming it. It was, however, undecided what is the danger, if any, attaching to the milk of tuberculous cows in which the udder presents no evidence of disease. We therefore took the opportunity of making a number of observations and experiments bearing on this point. The experiments were made with the milk of cows which had contracted the disease in the natural way. In natural tuberculosis in the cow, cases which show such obvious symptoms of the disease as emaciation and cough should be considered separately from the cases in which there are no such signs and in which the disease is to be recognised during life only by means of the injection of tuberculin. None of the cows investigated showed any sign of disease of the udder during life, and in all, after slaughtering, the udder was carefully examined for tuberculosis lesions and tubercle bacilli. No tuberculosis was found except in one case (Cow F), in which one quarter of the udder showed four small nodules. These could not possibly have been detected during life. We found that the milk of the cows obviously suffering from tuberculosis (see Appendix: Cows B, C, and F) contained tubercle bacilli whether the milk was obtained in the ordinary way or was withdrawn from the teat by means of a sterilised catheter. The presence of tubercle bacilli in the milk of cows clinically recognisable as tuberculous confirms the opinion we expressed in our Second Interim Report that the milk of such cows must be considered dangerous for human beings. The experiments which we have carried out with regard to the infectivity of the faeces of tuberculous cows were dictated by knowledge of the fact that dirt of various kinds from cows and the cow-shed is almost constantly present in milk as it reaches the consumer. Cows suffering from extensive tuberculosis of the lungs must discharge considerable numbers of a bacilli from the air passages in the act of coughing, and some of the bacilli thus expelled may find their way into the milk. But our experiments indicate that the excrement of cows obviously suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs or alimentary canal must be regarded as much more dangerous than the matter discharged from the mouth or nostrils. We have found that even in the case of cows with slight tuberculous lesions tubercle bacilli in small numbers are discharged in the faeces, while as regards cows clinically tuberculous, our experiments show that the faeces contain large numbers of living and virulent tubercle bacilli. The presence of tuberculous cows (such as B, C, and F), in company with healthy cows in the cow shed is therefore distinctly dangerous, as some of the tubercle bacilli which escape from their bodies in the excrement are almost certain to find their way into the milk. 122 Dirty Milk.—Four quarts of milk were found on the 11th January, 1909, by an Inspector deposited in a milk pail for the purpose of sale, and in such an apparently dirty state that he seized the milk and brought it to the Medical Officer of Health, who confirmed the fact that it was unfit for human food. It was taken to a magistrate and condemned as unfit for food. Samples of the top and bottom milk were submitted to the Bacteriologist, and were found to contain a large amount of various kinds and an abundant number of injurious micro organisms. Proceedings were taken against the possessor of the milk on 26th February, 1909, and the magistrate at Marylebone Police Court inflicted a fine of £10 instead of £50 in consideration of the fact that the defendant was in a small way of business. The magistrate was much disgusted to hear that the defendant intended to strain the milk, and would have done so and sold it so strained had it not been seized before he had time to do so. This is the second dirty milk case in which proceedings have been taken in St. Pancras. The Blowing of Carcases.—The carcases of animals intended for human food are sometimes inflated by air being blown in them. The object of this inflation is to render the surface of the carcase more tense for the purpose of facilitating the skinning, and of improving the appearance of the surface, which is thereby left more smooth after the skinning. The carcases usually so treated are those of young animals, namely, calves and lambs. The inflation is made into the subcutaneous tissues, that is, the connective tissue and the deep layers under the skin. The process is performed by means of a blow-pipe, one end of which is pushed into the subcutaneous tissue and the other of which is attached to a pair of bellows or air-pump, or inserted into the mouth of the operator. The latter method is obviously most objectionable. Five Authorities have obtained statutory power to prohibit, and do entirely prohibit, the blowing of carcases, namely, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Derby, King's Norton, and Edinburgh. Sheffield has on one occasion prosecuted and obtained a conviction of £2 and costs. Leeds and Hastings also have the power to prohibit, but allow the use of a pump, and Bradford, Croydon, Leicester, and Plymouth, although they have no power to prohibit blowing, have succeeded by advice in persuading butchers to use the pump in all cases. Bradford supplies pumps in the abattoirs on the understanding that they only are used. Other Authorities have no restrictions, but the general opinion appears to be in favour of the total abolition of the blowing of carcases.

Unfortunately the second sample is not a sample of the inculpated milk, but it may in some measure be evidence of the bona or male fides of the guarantor. Warranties.—For years past Local Authorities have made repeated representations to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture against the use of warranties relating to milk, which experience has shown to be capable of being largely used for the perversion of justice. The President of the Local Government Board introduced into the House of Commons on the 25th May, 1909, a Milk and Dairies Bill, Clause 7 of which runs:—"A warranty or invoice shall not be available as a defence to any proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907, where the article in respect of which the proceedings are taken is milk." In these circumstances it is unnecessary to quote further instances of the many possibilities warranties afford for adulterating milk with impunity. Preservatives in Food.—Samples of cream were taken by the Inspectors, and in five cases the amount of boric acid present was sufficient to warrant legal proceedings being taken, the amount of preservative varying from 0.19 per cent. to 0.41 per cent. The summonses were heard at the Marylebone 126 Police Court on the 20th November, 1908. The contention of the prosecution was that an offence had been committed inasmuch as no intimation was given to the purchaser of the presence of preservative, although in the majority of cases the percentage of preservative was below the amount mentioned in the Report of the Departmental Committee of the Local Government Board on the use of preservatives. The magistrate (Mr. Plowden) agreed with the contention of the Council, and decided that an offence had been committed, but inasmuch as it was undertaken by the Solicitors representing the Defendants, that in future notice should be given to the purchaser by a label, if cream with a preservative were sold, the Magistrate ordered each Defendant to pay £1 1s. costs. Arising out of these proceedings your Council considered the advisability of protecting both the public and the trade by making known the intention of this Authority to take proceedings against vendors of cream in this Borough when it contains boric acid as a preservative without the fact being notified to the purchaser by a label on the vessel, as recommended in the Report of the Departmental Committee of the Local Government Board on the Use of Preservatives. It is considered in the trade to be a matter of practical necessity for preservatives to be placed in cream during the summer, but, recognising the injurious effect of boric acid on infants and invalids, and the necessity for distinguishing between fresh and preserved cream, it was resolved that a communication should be sent to all the cream sellers whose premises are in St. Pancras, advising them that proceedings will be taken in future against anyone selling preserved cream in the Borough undeclared by label upon the vessel. Your Council ordered the following printed notice to be sent to all vendors of cream whose premises are in the Borough:— Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. To Vendors of Preserved Cream and all others whom it may concern. Notice is hereby given, that the Borough Council recognising the injurious effect of boric acid and other derivatives of borax, especially on infants and invalids, and the necessity for distinguishing between fresh and preserved cream, have decided to institute legal procedings in future against any person or persons selling in St. Pancras cream containing boric acid or any other derivatives of borax, without the fact being notified to the purchaser or purchasers of such cream by a label printed in bold and legible type, affixed to the vessel containing it, as recommended in the Report of the Departmental Committee of the Local Government Board on the Use of Preservatives. By order of the Council, C. H. F. Barrett, Town Clerk.

The following are the Reports of the Inspectors of Food Premises and of Food:— To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1908. Markets.—The market streets, costermongers' barrows, stalls, fishshops, and curing premises have been inspected daily, 2,136 inspections being made; the following articles of food have been destroyed, the same being unfit for the food of man. Unsound Food:— 1 Carcase of Beef, 110 st. 11 lbs. 1 Carcase of Pork, 14 st. 1 Pig's Pluck. Bacon, 11 st. Fish, mixed, 9 st. Kippers, 11 boxes. Cod Fish, 8 st. Mussels, 16 st. Whelks, 8 st. Cherries, 286 lbs. Water Cress, 2 cwt., 3 qrs. Food Makers.—I made 549 inspections of premises where food is prepared, such as polonies, sausages, pies, &c., and found the meat and other ingredients used sound and wholesome, and the premises generally kept in a cleanly condition. Slaughterhouses.—There are 11 licensed slaughterhouses in my divisions, of which 311 inspections were made and no infringements of the By-laws found. I inspected a large number of animals slaughtered and found them generally of good quality and free from disease. Cowsheds.—There are only three licensed cowsheds registered to keep 70 cows, this being a reduction of two sheds and 39 cows since my last report. I have not seen any infringement of the regulations, and the cows kept are of good quality and have been quite free from disease during the year. Milk shops.—I made 422 inspections of the registered milkshops and dairies, no prosecutions for infringements of the By-laws have been taken, but it has been necessary to caution several persons us to cleanliness and for selling milk without being registered, especially the small general shops, 65 per cent. of which are in my opinion totally unsuitable for the storage and sale of milk. Food and Drugs Act.—I submitted 325 samples to the Public Analyst for analysis (for results see Analyst's Report). Bacteriological Examination.—I submitted 8 samples of milk for examination (for results see Dr. Eyre's Report). Legal Proceedings.—I attended the Police Courts 33 times in connection with my duties as Prosecuting Food Inspector. (For results see Appendix.) I am Sir, yours obediently, J. Osborne, Food Inspector. 129 CANAL BOATS ACT. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, During the year 1908, I inspected 32 Dwelling Boats; two Notices have been issued to repair defects, both of which have been complied with. No infectious disease or other illness has come under my notice on any of the Boats inspected, and the regulations have been fairly well observed. I am Sir, yours obediently, J. Osborne, Canal Boat Inspector. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my report for 1908. I made 705 visits to the market streets during the year, and procured 100 samples of food under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. 53 inspections were made of premises where food was exposed for sale or in the course of preparation for sale. Periodical visits were made to Milkshops, Slaughterhouses, Ice Cream places, and Cowsheds.

Bacteriological Elimination of Milk.—I took 16 specimens of milk for bacteriological examination; 5 specimens were purchased at milkshops as "Nursery Milk," the remainder were purchased at a cowshed and drawn straight from the cow into a sterilised bottle. Periodical Inspection of Registered Premises.—I made the usual inspections of Bakehouses, Registered Tenement Houses, Workshops, and Factories, where necessary notices were served for the abatement of nuisances or breaches of the Statute or By-laws. I am, &c., W. G. Auger. 130 To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report on my work in the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Borough for the year ended December 31st, 1908, as Inspector of Food and Food places.

Food Makers.—I made 468 visits to the premises where sausages, ice cream, tripe, &c., are made and, with few exceptions, found the premises satisfactory, utensils clean, and the food sound. Licensed Slaughterhouses.—There are now only 5 slaughterhouses in my district. I made 224 inspections during which I saw 439 sheep, 112 bullocks, 108 pigs, 44 lambs, 9 calves, killed and dressed, and such organs as on examination were found to be diseased I had removed by the written request of the owners, under Sub-section 8 of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The following table shows the number of animals and organs found to be diseased, nature of diseases, &c.:— No. Description of Carcase Disease. Where affected.

For the purpose of preventing danger to the public health from the importations, preparation, storage, and distribution of articles of food or drink (other than drugs or water) the Act applies the methods of control which, in pursuance of an earlier series of enactments, have long been in successful operation with respect to infectious disease. The enactments thus applied include Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as amended by the Public Health Act, 1896, and as extended to London by Section 113 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. A general power of making regulations for the main purpose of the Act of 1907 is given to the Local Government Board, and under this power the Board issued the sets of regulations before mentioned and known also as Statutory Rules and Orders, 1908, No. 717 (Foreign Meat Regulations) and No. 718 (Unsound Food Regulations). 141 Subsequent to these Regulations or Statutory Rules and Orders the Local Government Board have issued circulars drawing the attention of Port Sanitary Autorities and certain other Sanitary Authorities to particular points. The first circular dated 16th September, 1908, relates botli to Unsound Food and to Foreign Meat, circular No. 2, dated 12th December, 1908, relates only to Foreign Meat, as also do circular No. !3 and No. 4, dated respectively 20th January, 1909, and 29th April, 1909. § 4.—BY-LAWS. No new Bv-laws were made during- the year. •/ § 5.—REGULATIONS.

EXTRACT FROM "PUBLIC HEALTH," p. 211. High Court of Justice, lung'ft Bench Division—December 9th, 1907. Farmer v. Long Pallia Health (London) Act, 1891—Nuisance Procednr", Leaning Drai???. In consequence of anonymous communication, a drain was tested and no nuisance found. Afterwards it was opened up and found to be leaking. On proceedings taken to abate the nuisance the Magistrate found that there was a "leaking drain." This was held to be a sufficient finding of a nuisance to entitle him to make an abatement order, and that the manner in which the nuisance was discovered was immaterial. This was a case stated by a Metropolitan Police Magistrate on the hearing of a summons requiring the appellant as owner of certain premises to abate a nuisance. It appeared that the sanitary authority received a complaint on an anonymous post card, and that in consequence the drains were tested, with no result. The authority then caused them to be opened up and found that the drains had been laid with clay joints, that the clay had completely perished, and- that the drain was leaking. No one had complained of any smell or other nuisance. The Magistrate made an order to abate the nuisance. The court dismissed the appeal. Channei l, J., in the course of his judgment said that if what was discovered was a nuisance, it did not signify whether it was discovered by proper or improper means. He thought tint the finding that the drain was leaking was a sufficient finding of a nuisance -a mere defective drain might not be a nuisance. Bray and Sutton, J. J., agreed.

Margarine Act, 1887, Sec. 3 -- Meaning of"Margarine "—New Butter Substitute. All substances prepared for sale in imitation of butter must be sold as margarine and comply with the terms of the Margarine Act, 1887, and it is immaterial whether they are made of vegetable or animal fats, and whether or not they were known at the date of the passing of that Act. This was a case stated by the Justices for Derby on the hearing of an information against the respondent, Alton, for selling margarine by retail without complying with the terms of the Margarine Act, 1887, as to branding the package with the name "margarine," and as to delivering it in a paper wrapper printed with the name margarine." The article in question was sold as butter, or as nut cream butter. The paper case in which it was enclosed had printed on it the words "Nut Cream I!utter," but not the word "Margarine." The sample was certified by the analyst as consisting wholly of magarine and containing no butter. For the respondent evidence was given to show that the substance was made wholly from nuts, that it contained no animal fat whatsoever, and that it was a compound unknown at the date of the Margarine Act, 1887. It was stated, also, that up to the date of the passing of that Act all margarine, commonly so called, was made of animal fat, and that the name was then and had ever since been ordinarily applied to compounds containing animal fat and no others. The Justices dismissed the summons, as they were of opinion that although the sample had been prepared in imitation of butter, they thought that this vegetable compound did not come within the purview of the Act. The Court allowed the Appeal. Alverstone, L.C.J., in giving judgment, said that Sect. 3 of the Margarine Act, 1887, provided that the word "margarine" shall mean all substances, whether compounds or ortherwise prepared in imitation of butter and whether mixed with butter or not, and no such substance shall be sold except under the name of margarine and under the conditions set fortb in the Act. The Justices had found that this substance had been prepared in imitation of butter, and it therefore fell within the definition. The appeal must, therefore, be allowed and the case remitted to the Justices. Ridley and Darling concurred. (For full report see 72 J.P. 252.) EXTRACT FROM " PUBLIC HEALTH," JULY, 1908. Before Lord Alverstone, L.C.J., Darling and Sutton, J.J. Cullin v. McNair. Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, Sec. 3.—Cream mixed with boracic acid.— Sale of such as Cream. When an article is sold as cream, an offence wdl be committed under Section 3 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, if such article is a mixture 143 of cream and boracic acid in such proportion as to b2 injurious to invalids and children. It might be otherwise if the sale was one of a stated or known mixture of cream and boracic acid. This was a case stated by the Chairman of the County of London Quarter Sessions on the hearing of an appeal from a conviction by a Police Magistrate at Westminster Police Court. The Quarter Sessions affirmed the conviction. (See Public Health, Vol. 20, p. 282.) The sale was made by Cullen to an assistant of McNair, an Inspector of the Westminster City Council, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Ttie article was mixed with 0.313 per cent, of boracic acid, and proceedings were taken under section 3 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875 The Court held that preserved cream was harmless when taken by a normal adult person in ordinary quantities if the quantity of boracic acid did not exceed the above amount, and even if it was as high as 35 grains to the pound, but that it was injurious to the health of invalids and children. The Court affirmed the conviction and dismissed the Appeal. The Lord Chief Justice: In my opinion we ought not to interfere in this case. I wish it to be understood that I must dismiss from my mind altogether the matters that have been told us quite outside of the case. I am very sorry, bat I cannot allow them to be taken into my consideration. For instance, we have been told tint they have been over and over again to the Local Government Board to ask them to interfere, and they will not. There is no statement of that kind in the case. Personally, I should not be disposed to credit it without a statement being made, but, at anv rate, we cannot allow that sort of statement to be made by Counsel to influence us in this case. Now the article sold here was sold as cream. It is described as cream. It is described as rich cream, and it is then further said that this cream contains a small percentage of boron preservative to retard sourness. I suppose that people know that cream goes sour, and therefore, in my opinion, it is not sufficient under such a sale, and under such a label, to say it ought to be treated as an article which has passed away from being cream and has become preserved cream, and the case finds that no indication beyond the label was given to the purchaser as to its composition. Now they have found " That the boracic acid contained "In preserved cream might be used by dishonest traders to mask decomposition "and any impurity in the cream, but that boracic acid was generally used by "the trade for the purpose of keeping the cream good for several days, "varying from two to six." Under these circumstances it seems to me this is is a matter as to which, if there is evidence of it being injurious to health, the public ought to be more protected than they are at the present time. The magistrates have found, as a fact, that it is injurious to children and invalids ; and both the original magistrates and the magistrates at Quarter Sessions have thought that the article, as it was, and used as it was, was an article which was injurious to a substantial portion of the community. It must not be thought that I think they ought to find a thing injurious to health because some exceptional individual is liable to have some particular injury done to his health, such as lead poisoning or anything of that sort, by eating some particular article of food. It is a case in which, upon the case stated, the cream, if given to children or invalids, is injurious to health. It seems to me it is 144 open to the magistrates to say that a person who did that had mixed with au article of food an ingredient so as to render the article injurious to health, with the intent that the same shall be sold in that state. I express no opinion as to what the magistrates ought to decide in cases where notices have been given that it is not to be taken by infants, by invalids or by children, or where some other steps have been taken to protect, but it seems to me that, where you have a sale of cream simpliciter, and this article given, it was open to the magistrate to find, as a fact, that it was injurious to health within the section. They have so found if, and I do not think, upon these facts, that it is open to the appellants to say that the people to whom it was injurious were such a small percentage that the magistrates' finding is bad in law. I think, therefore, this aj)peal must be dismissed. Darling, J., concurred with regret. Sutton, J., thought the conviction was right, as the appellant sold cream and not preserved cream. EXTRACT FROM "PUBLIC HEALTH," NOVEMBER, 1908. Pfcterrativrs hi Milk and Cream.—At the Kingston County Police Court, on October 1st, Messrs. T. II. Moon & Son-, dairymen, of Surbiton, were summoned for selling cream which was not of the nature, substance, and quality demanded, being adulterated with boric acid to the extent of 0.27 per cent., or 19 grains to the pound. Mr. G. C. Whiteley, barrister, said that the dairymen might add a limited quantity of boric acid as a preservative, provided notice was given to the purchaser of the fact. In this case no such notice was given, and the general effect of the use of boric acid was that it enabled stale cream to be sold to customers, who thought they were getting pure fresh cream. Mr. Edward Ilincks, County Analyst, said boric acid was itself injurious, and even a small quantity was deleterious to children and invalids. The defence set up was one of warranty, and it was shown that the defendants never used boric themselves. It was also contended by Mr. Sherwood, who defended, that the quantity was too minute to be injurious. The Magistrate imposed a penalty of £1 13s. 0d., including analyst's fee and costs. At the same court Frank Hanson, dairyman, of Thames Ditton, was summoned for selling milk containing boric acid to the extent of 2½ grains per pint, and ho was fined £1 9s. 0d., including costs. 145 VII—REPORTS OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH.
