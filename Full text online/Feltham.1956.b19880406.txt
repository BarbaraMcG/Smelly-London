Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the Health and Sanitation of your District for the year 1956. The District is divided into three Wards: Bedfont, Feltham and Hanworth, with a total acreage of 4,925. The Home population (mid year) as estimated by the Registrar General was 49,230. This was a further increase, the 1955 figure being 48,870. The day population is increased by people working at the various factories and shops, but a large number of residents work outside the district, particularly in London. Only a very small number continue to work in agriculture.

Deaths from tuberculosis are again lower than the previous year and the number of new cases notified shows a considerable fall from fifty-one to thirty-two. Maternal Mortality There were no maternal deaths during the year. Persons in Need of Care and Attention It was not found necessary to take action under the National Assistance Acts in respect of persons requiring care and attention. In certain cases arrangements were made with the Area Medical Officer of Health for the assistance of Home Helps. Housing Since house building recommenced in 1946 this Authority has built 1,981 dwellings and 746 private dwellings have been erected. In addition there are 150 temporary bungalows. There was still a considerable demand for houses, mostly from young couples who were sharing accommodation, and difficulties of finance and shortage of building land made it increasingly difficult for the Council to deal with this need. Diphtheria Immunisation Facilities for immunisation against diphtheria are provided by the Middlesex County Council at their clinics or through the local medical practitioners. The Department has co-operated with the Area Medical Officer of the County with regard to the publicity campaigns which have been undertaken. Poliomyelitis Vaccination Vaccination against poliomyelitis was undertaken by the Middlesex County Council at their three clinics in the area. 252 children received a course of two injections during May and June. 8 Water Analysis 1. The Eedfont and Feltham Wards of the District are supplied by the South West Suburban Water Co., and the Hanworth Ward by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water supplied to this area by the South West Suburban Water Co. is taken by the Company from the Metropolitan Water Board. The water is derived from the River Thames, purified in the storage reservoirs at Littleton, Staines and Walton, and is filtered and chlorinated at the Hampton Works. A contact period of over an hour is given at the works for the completion of chlorination. The water supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. 2. Samples for bacteriological examination (976) and chemical analysis (225) were taken by the Metropolitan Water Board at all stages of purification at least five times each week. Eightynine samples have been taken by the South West Suburban Water Co. In addition ten samples were taken by my department. Average Results of Analyses of Metropolitan Water Board Supply.

The water supplied has no plumbo solvent action but samples are tested for presence of metals. 4. No action has been required in respect of contamination of the water. All water is chlorinated before distribution and all new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being restored to use. 5. With the exception of one or two outlying cottages, all the houses in the area are supplied from the public water mains. Only two houses are supplied by a common stand-pipe. These two cottages, which are now condemned, are occupied by three people. 10 Food Poisoning Twelve unrelated cases of food poisoning have been notified during the year. Investigations were made in all cases but the sources of infection were not ascertained. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment One establishment was licensed under Sections 355-357 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. Conclusion In conclusion I should like to thank the members of the Committee for the support which they have given me during the year and also Mr. Bell and the staff of the department for their able and willing assistance. F. H. WOODS, Medical Officer of Health. 11 CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR'S REPORT Housing—Demolition and Closure Action within the framework of the Council's programme for dealing with unfit houses was continued, details of which are given below. The Council has pursued a continuous policy in this matter since 1950 and the worst of the unfit houses have now been dealt with. The rehousing of the people displaced tended to become more difficult as with a reduced building programme there was less interchange of accommodation and this is necessary to provide the varying types of dwelling required to meet the needs of the different sized family units to be accommodated. It is particularly difficult at times to provide suitable accommodation for persons living on their own. The Council has always made it a special feature of the programme that every endeavour be made to rehouse people displaced, as far as possible in accordance with their desires. As a result there has been little friction and it is believed that hardship has been kept at a minimum. One or two owners considered making offers to carry out works of repair, rather than have their houses demolished, but almost invariably, after full consideration, decided not to do so and to accept demolition orders. It was necessary to have one pair of cottages demolished in the owner's default. From 1946 until the end of 1956, 211 houses have been dealt with as follows: — Demolition Orders made 189 Agreements entered into with owners to "close" or repair or Closing Orders made 18 Houses demolished 149 Houses demolished as a result of informal action 4 Persons who have been displaced 514 Action taken during 1956 is as follows:— Housing Act, 1936 Houses reported to Public Health Committee as being unfit 40 Demolition Orders made 41 12 Houses demolished as a result of formal or informal procedure under Section 11 35 Houses closed in pursuance of an undertaking given by the owners under Section 11, and still in force – Agreements entered into with owners to repair 1 Parts of buildings closed (Section 12) 1 Houses closed as a result of Closing Orders made under Sections 3 (1) and 3 (2), Housing Act,1949 – Houses closed as a result of Closing Orders made under Sections 10(1) and 11 (2), Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953 2 Total number of persons displaced 71 Housing—Repairs Defects in dwelling-houses continued to receive attention and repairs were carried out as far as possible. The result of the action taken is summarised below. A few notices were served under the Housing Acts but with the older houses the question of "reasonable cost" very considerably restricted the scope for action to secure repairs. The new Rent Bill, when in operation, may modify the position in some cases but whether sufficiently to enable effective action to be taken remains to be seen. Even where it is possible for a house to be brought up to the standard laid down in section 9 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act it still fails to provide the amenities and comfort which most members of the public expect today and is regarded as a sub-standard house. Informal Action Number of unfit or defective houses rendered fit during the period as a result of informal action by the local authority 128 Action under Statutory Powers Number of houses reported to Public Health Committee with a view to service of statutory notices ... 22 Number of statutory notices served ... ... ... 12 Public Health Acts Number of houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices: — (a) by owners ... ... ... ... ... 14 (b) by local authority in default of owners ... - 13 Housing Act, 1936 Number of houses made fit after service of formal notices (Sections 9, 10, 11 and 16): — (a) by owners 7 (b) by local authority in default of owners – Housing—Improvement Grants Very few enquiries with regard to Improvement Grants were received and in accordance with a previous decision, no grants were made. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954—Disrepair Certificates No applications for disrepair certificates were received. One application for the revocation of a certificate was made and this was granted. Overcrowding Little statutory overcrowding came to the notice of the department. The Council's housing points scheme made special provision for any applicant who was overcrowded, but in view of the reducing numbers of houses available, cases of overcrowding found in the future may require to be given particular consideration. Moveable Dwellings Public Health control of moveable dwellings in the area is effected by means of Section 345 of the Middlesex County Council Act as amended by the 1950 Act and by byelaws. The consent of the Council is required to the placing or keeping of any moveable dwelling used or intended to be used as the sole or principal means of habitation for more than three months in any year. During the year 18 applications for consent were received, 12 were refused and a limited consent given in the other 6 cases. Action was taken to secure the removal of 27 caravans in respect of the use of which no consent had been given. It has been the Council's policy for many years not to allow the use of caravans in the area as permanent dwellings. There is no doubt that, but for this policy, which has been pursued effectively, there would now be a large population of caravan dwellers. 14 A little trouble has been experienced with the wandering gypsy type of caravan dweller but much of the land upon which these people camped is no longer available. Shops All shops were regularly inspected, the department administering the whole of the provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, the frequency of inspection depending upon the class of business carried on. One licence for the keeping of a pet shop was granted. Three shops were licensed to deal in game. The "late day" for the general closing hours of shops in the area is Friday, but shopkeepers remain free to fix their own half day closing subject to the provisions of the Shops Act. Most shops close for half day on Wednesday. There was no evidence of shops remaining open after the closing hours, but a number of shops open on Sundays and inspections were made in connection with the limited range of articles permitted to be sold on that day. Food Premises Regular inspections of all types of food premises were made, special attention and more frequent visits being made to catering establishments, premises registered under section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, bakehouses and other places where food is actually prepared. The new Food Hygiene Regulations came into force upon the 1st January and 1st July. A circular was sent to all food premises reminding the occupiers of the provisions of the new regulations, and during the routine visiting action has been taken to ensure compliance with the regulations. Most traders were co-operative and saw the need for the various measures and only a few had to be persuaded. There has been little serious opposition. The protection of food from risk of contamination, when displayed for sale, has not yet been satisfactorily accomplished in some shops, particularly butchers and bakers shops. Old ideas die hard and there were some practical difficulties. Statutory action was not resorted to and it is hoped will not be necessary. 15 With the improved facilities now provided generally in food premises, the onus for ensuring personal cleanliness and hygienic food handling falls more upon the individual food handler, and it may be that rather sharper reminders of these responsibilities will have to be given in the future. Food premises in the district consist of the following:— Catering establishments including factory canteens and school kitchens 120 Grocery and provision shops and "general stores" 66 Greengrocers' shops 35 Butchers' shops 27 Bakers' shops 14 Milk shops 8 Fishmongers' shops 15 Sweet and confectionery shops 61 Food Preparing Premises There was one new registration during the year. The register contained the addresses of 31 premises which had been registered under the Act for the preservation, etc., of food as follows:— Premises used for the manufacture of sausages, pies, etc. 12 Premises used for the cooking of fish 10 Premises used for the cooking of bacon 9 Hawkers of Foodstuffs Under the provisions of Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, persons selling foodstuffs from any vehicle, etc., who are not the occupiers of an open shop for the sale of foodstuffs, require to be registered with the local authority and the food stores at which the foodstuffs intended for sale are stored are also required to be registered. A good deal of attention had to be given to these fool traders to ensure a reasonable hygienic standard in their methods and storage arrangements. Six new hawkers of foodstuffs were registered. 16 Street Traders Persons wishing to trade from a fixed site in any public street are required to hold a licence under Sections 320 and 321 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944, and issued by the local authority. There was only one street trader in the area whose licence to sell fruit and vegetables was renewed during the year. Slaughter-Houses New byelaws with regard to private slaughter-houses were adopted by the Council and confirmed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; they came into operation on the 24th September. There was no increase in the amount of slaughtering in the area and there did not appear to be any demand for increased facilities. Number of slaughter-houses licensed 3 Number of slaughtermen licensed 11 Knackers Yard There was one licensed knackers yard which was used to only a very limited extent. 17 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Carcases and Offal inspected at slaughter-houses and condemned in whole or in part Cattle Excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses No. killed (if known) – – – – 15 115 No. inspected – – – – 15 115 All diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci Whole carcases condemned – – – – – – Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned – – – – – 33 Percentage of the number inspected infected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci – – – – – 28.7 Tuberculosis only Whole carcases condemned – – – – – – Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned – – – – – – Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis – – – – – – Cysticercosis Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned – – – – – – Carcases submitted to treatment by refrigeration – – – – – – Generalised and totally condemned – – – – – – Meat Inspected at Butchers' Shops A number of carcases, quarters, parts of carcases and organs have been examined.

Disposal of Condemned Food Where possible condemned foodstuffs are sent to a waste products factory where they are processed for non-edible purposes. Foodstuffs which are not suitable for such disposal are buried at the Council's refuse tip. Food and Drugs Act, 1938—Food and Drugs Authority The Middlesex County Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the district. The Public Control Department carry out the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, operated by the County Council and I am indebted to the Chief Officer of that Department, Mr. J. A. O' Keefe, for the following details of action taken in this district:— 19 Samples procured: — Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk (new) 135 78 Milk (various) 34 – Arrowroot 4 – Butter 6 – Cakes 3 – Cream 6 – Drugs 15 – Fish and Fish products 13 – Fruit juice 3 – Fruit 2 – Fruit, canned 12 – Liver 8 – Meat 3 – Miscellaneous 9 – Pickles, etc. 3 – Preserves 3 – Sausages 5 1 Suet 2 – Sweets 3 – Vinegar 6 – Wines and Spirits 6 – Totals 281 79 It is stated that the position with regard to the seventyeight unsatisfactory milk samples is not so bad as the figures, alone, suggest. Fifty-two were preliminary samples taken from one farmer and were very slightly deficient in quality. Later samples proved satisfactory. A prosecution in respect of the other unsatisfactory samples resulted in fines and costs of £61 10s. 0d. The unsatisfactory sausages contained undeclared preservative and an official caution was given. Fifty-one inspections of shops were made in connection with the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1926, but no infringements serious enough to warrant proceedings being instituted were discovered. The labelling of Food Order, 1953, requires certain prepacked foods to bear on the label a clear statement of the 20 designation of the food and in the case of compound foods, the ingredients. It also requires that the name and address of the packer or labeller appears. Twenty-eight premises were visited and infringements found were rectified immediately. No proceedings were taken. In addition advertisements and the labels of prepacked foods were scrutinised to detect false or misleading descriptions. Corrective action was taken with regard to a number of commodities. One licence was issued to use the designation "pasteurised" in relation to milk processed in the area. The premises were inspected regularly and fifty-nine samples taken. The premises and samples were satisfactory. Eight samples of raw milk were tested for tubercle bacilli but none was contaminated. Milk (Special Designations), (Raw Milk), (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 Dealers licences were granted to sell graded milks as follows:— Tuberculin Tested 9 Pasteurised 9 Sterilised 22 Supplementary Licences: Tuberculin Tested 12 Pasteurised 12 Sterilised 13 Forty-six samples of graded milks were taken and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Epsom. All the samples were satisfactory. There are twenty-five registered milk distributors and one dairy. Ice Cream Premises at which ice cream was sold continued to receive regular attention. There were no registered manufacturers of ice cream in the area. Three premises were registered, under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, for the sale of ice cream. 21 Twelve samples of ice cream were procured and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Epsom. All were graded Group 1. The Council has received many complaints regarding the noise and disturbance caused by the various instruments used by mobile ice cream vendors to attract attention. Appeals to the users of these instruments, which range from amplified recordings of popular tunes to ordinary motor horns, have not produced any noticeable effect and it appears that the effectiveness of Police action in this matter is limited. Rodent Control The control of rat and mice infestations in accordance with the methods advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was continued. The Council's refuse tip was kept under regular observation and any sign of rat activity dealt with immediately. During the twelve months ended on the 31st March, 1956, the complaints received numbered 190. and these together with cases discovered by members of the staff involved the inspection of 1,542 premises. Rat infestations were found at 237 premises and mice infestations at 83 premises. Of these 292 treatments were undertaken by the department, the remaining 28 being carried out by the occupiers. When treatments are carried out by this department on behalf of occupiers, a standard charge of five shillings is made in the case of private dwellings, and the full cost of the treatment is recovered in the case of business premises. Where the occupiers elect to carry out the treatment themselves, advice and supervision is given to ensure that the treatment is effective. Arrangements were continued with the Middlesex County Council for the department to carry out any rodent control works necessary on the portions of the Duke of Northumberland's River and the River Crane in the area. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There are three premises registered under this Act, where filling materials are used. Five inspections were made. 22 Disinfesation Seven premises were found to be infested with bed bugs and were disinfected: Council houses infested 5 Other houses infested 2 Disinfestation with contact insecticides incorporating D.D.T. was carried out by the department. It was not found necessary to disinfest the furniture, etc., of prospective Council house tenants before removal to the Council's houses. Disinfestation for the eradication of the following vermin was carried out at the numbers of premises stated:— Cockroaches 5, fleas 1, woodworm 2, lice 1. In addition 3 wasps' nests were destroyed. Infectious Diseases—Disinfection The following numbers of premises have been disinfected after cases (or suspected cases) of infectious disease:— Tuberculosis 2 Scarlet Fever 7 Meningitis 2 Administration of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948 Part I of the Act 1.
