Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, In presenting this report, may I record that I commenced duty as your Medical Officer of Health in October, 1955, when I took over from Dr.Adamson who had very ably carried on since Dr. Cullington left in June, 1955, to take up his appointment as Deputy County Medical Officer of Health for Devonshire. I should also like to record my thanks for the help I have received from my colleagues and from members of the Council. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, jheanhe Medical Officer of Health. Page 6 GENERAL PUBLIC HEALTH THAMES VIEW HOUSING ESTATE Clinic Premises Towards the end of the year, the Minister of Health approved in principle the need for a Health Services Clinic on this Estate. The Ministry of Health considered, however, that the accommodation in the scheme put forward was too extensive and costly and suggested that a revised scheme should be submitted using as a basis a sketch plan prepared by them. This sketch plan shows a reduction of 1,000 sq. ft. of floor space as compared with the original scheme. At the end of the year the Borough Architect was preparing revised plans. General Practitioner Services Throughout the year the Barking Medical Society was in negotiation with the Executive Council for Essex and the Essex Local Medical Committee trying to work out details for providing medical services on the Estate. MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH Population The population of Barking at mid-1955, according to the Registrar General's estimate, was 75,990. This shows a further decrease from the figure of 78, 170 at the 1951 Census. Births 980 live births and 30 still births were registered during 1955, distributed as follows:— Live Births:— Males Females Total Legitimate 516 435 951 Illegitimate 13 16 29 Totals 529 451 980 Still-Births:— Legitimate 17 12 29 Illegitimate - 1 1 Totals 17 13 30 Total Live and Still-Births 546 464 1,010 Birth Rate per 1,000 of Estimated Population 12.896. Birth Rate adjusted by Comparability Factor of 0.93=11.99. Still-Birth Rate per 1,000 (Live and Still) Births 29.7. Page 7 Loss of Infant Life The infant death rate in 1955 was 24.49 as compared with 20 for 1954. The following tables show the causes of infant deaths:— INFANTILE MORTALITY—1955 Cause of Death Age at Death Total under 1 year 0-1 mth. 1-3 mths. 3-6 mths. 6-9 mths. 9-12 mths.

Page 8 DEATHS Causes of Death in 1955 Total Tuberculosis and other Infectious Diseases 15 Cancer and other Malignant Diseases 181 Diseases of the Brain and Nervous System 66 Diseases of the Heart and Circulatory System 200 Pneumonia, Bronchitis and other Respiratory Diseases (excluding T.B.) 84 Diseases of the Stomach and Digestive System 18 Accidents, Poisonings and Violence 31 Infant Deaths and Congenital Malformations 25 Other causes 47 Total 667 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 Estimated Population 8.777. Adjusted Death Rate (Comparability Factor 1.33)= 11.67. INFECTIOUS DISEASES The following notifications were received during the year:— [##] Notifications Deaths Pneumonia 51 36 Tuberculosis Respiratory 62 68 7 9 Non-Respiratory 6 2 Scarlet Fever 40 - Dysentery 22 - Puerperal Pyrexia 34 - Measles 1,568 - Whooping Cough 49 - Food Poisoning 21 - Erysipelas 6 - Scabies 9 - Malaria - - Meningococcal Infection 4 - Poliomyelitis 18 - Diphtheria - - Ophthalmia Neonatorum 1 - Paratyphoid Fever 6 - Page 9 Poliomyelitis Of the 18 cases notified, 11 unfortunately developed paralysis but fortunately, no deaths occurred. Of the 11 cases who developed paralysis 5 were "mild" cases but the remaining 6 had severe paralytic symptoms. All cases were admitted to hospital and at the end of the year all but 3 had been discharged. It is anticipated that there will be residual paralysis in 4 cases. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Licences were renewed during the year in respect of the four establishments which are governed by the Borough's bye-laws. LAUNDRY SERVICE Once again the Borough Council's laundry service proved an invaluable adjunct to the services provided in the home to care for the chronic sick. During the year 29 cases were assisted. Page 10 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICE This section deals with those services which come under the control of the Barking Health Area Sub-Committee of the Health Committee of the Essex County Council. CARE OF MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN maternity service Ante-Natal Care. This was received by all but 2 of the 988 Barking mothers confined during 1955 and was given as follows:— Clinics 824 Hospitals (excluding Barking Hospital) 114 General Practitioners 48 No ante-natal care 2 988 Confinements. During the year 988 mothers were confined, giving birth to 1,010 infants (including 22 pairs of twins). These were born as follows:— Barking Hospital 646 Other Hospitals 117 At home 247 1,010 From this it will be seen that the majority of Barking babies continue to be born in hospital. I regret to have to report a maternal death during 1955, in a patient who was taken ill during labour and admitted to hospital. She died before delivery could be effected from pulmonary embolus, which may have had no association with the pregnancy. The maternal mortality rate is 0.99 per 1,000 live and still births. Post-Natal Care. 810 women attended the Post-Natal Clinic making a total of 1,021 attendances; 211 women had conditions requiring a further attendance. Of the 810 women who attended, 276 were resident outside the area but had their babies in Barking Hospital. Out of a total of 988 confinements of Barking mothers during the year, 634 attended the Post-Natal Clinic; 130 were under the care of their General Practitioner Page 1l and 114 were under the care of a hospital outside the district. This gives us a figure of 72% attendance at the Post-Natal Clinic. INFANT WELFARE ATTENDANCES AT INFANT WELFARE CLINICS— 1955 Number of children born in 1955 who attended 858 Total number of children who attended 2,738 Total attendances 27,390 Live births in 1955 numbered 980. Taking into account the fact that 67 babies were born in the last two weeks of 1955, and their mothers could scarcely have had the opportunity of bringing them along to a clinic in that year, approximately 94% of all children born to Barking mothers were seen at our Infant Welfare Clinics. Distribution of Welfare Foods The following table shows the welfare foods distributed during the year:— National Dried Milk 37,607 packets Cod Liver Oil 8,796 bottles Vitamin Tablets (A & D) 3,868 packets Orange Juice 70,660 bottles DAY NURSERIES The two remaining day nurseries, viz Eastbury (80 places) and Gale Street (50 places) functioned throughout the year and the table below shows the combined attendances at these nurseries:— No. on Register Average daily attendances January 71 45.4 February 66 47.8 March 67 46.8 April 71 55.4 May 77 58.5 June 68 56.8 July 69 48.6 August 71 48.8 September 72 57.0 October 85 68.2 November 86 66.9 December 80 61.8 Page 12 During the year the Minister of Health approved in principle the erection of a 50 place day nursery to be erected on Mayesbrook Meadow as a replacement for Eastbury Day Nursery. Nursery and Child Minders' Regulation Act. There are no registered child minders in the Borough. MIDWIFERY During 1955, we had five midwives practising in the district, including two under the auspices of the Queen's Nurses; 248 patients were delivered in their own homes, only some 25% of all patients confined. Supervision of Midwives Miss D Riseley, Matron of the Barking Hospital, has continued to act as non-medical supervisor of midwives. Dr. Adamson was appointed as Medical Supervisor of Midwives in April, 1955. health VISITING The following statistics relate to the work of health visitors:- HEALTH VISITING, 1955 No. of visits to Expectant Mothers 1,111 No. of visits to Children under five 8,224 No. of other visits 3,837 No. of Non-Access visits 1,660 HOME NURSING This service, together with approximately half of the domiciliary midwifery scrvice, is still administered from the County Training Home at Leytonstone. vaccination and immunisation Small pox Vaccination The number of primary vaccinations carried out in 1955 was 172 in infants under one year, 37 in those over one year. This means that less than 20% of infants are being vaccinated during the first year of life. Page 13 Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation The number of children receiving primary courses of immunisatio during the year was as follows:— DIPHTHERIA Family doctors Clinics Total Separate 69 354 423 Combined with whooping cough 127 120 247 Total Diphtheria 196 474 670 WHOOPING COUGH Family doctors Clinics Total Separate 62 255 317 Combined with diphtheria 127 120 247 Total whooping cough 189 375 564 prevention of illness, care and after-care Chiropody Service This still remains a very popular service and difficulty was experienced in meeting all demands for treatment. The total number of attendances made was 24,023 as compared with 20,557 for the previous year. Unfortunately, in many cases treatment had to be less frequent than was desirable and a recommendation was made that the establishment should be increased from six to seven full-time chiropodists to meet current needs At the end of the year the additional chiropodist had not been agreed to and the resignation of two of the permanent staff had been received. Page 14 DOMESTIC HELP SERVICE There was an increase in the number of hours of domestic help given this year, the total being 105,104. Year Number of Helps Employed Number of Cases Helped Total Hours Worked 1950 55 387 80,699 1951 49 327 70,611 1952 84 318 85,743 1953 89 384 105,121 1954 89 503 101,960 1955 90 556 105,104 Page 15 SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE MEDICAL INSPECTION AND TREATMENT The Statistical Return at the end of this report shows the classification of defects found and the treatment thereof.

The speech therapists have now been supplied with a tape recording machine which will be a useful adjunct to their work. DENTAL SERVICES Statistics relating to this service will be found in the Statistical Return at the end of this report. With regard to staff, the total of five full-time dental officers was reduced to three under unfortunate circumstances. Mr. R B. Pitts resigned in June because of ill-health and Dr. J.

Three children (1 Barking and 2 Ilford) were found to be ineducable and recommended for action under Section 57(3) of the Education Act, 1944. One Barking child was found incapable of receiving education at school on the ground that it is inexpedient that he should be educated in association with other children, and recommended for action under Section 57(4) of the Education Act, 1944. Three Ilford children were no longer considered to require special educational treatment— two returned to ordinary schools and one, aged 15, was allowed to leave school. Three children (2 Ilford and 1 Romford) were transferred to Residential Schools.

Not only is the education of the householder increased by talks in the home, but more formal lectures are given to groups There is an increasing demand for information on public health matters by various sections of the community at organised meetings. Your officers welcome the opportunity of discussing their work and also learning from the audience their problems. A great deal of educational work is done also by the sanitary inspectors during their visits to trade premises and factories in their food hygiene and smoke abatement problems. There is overwhelming evidence that this educational work in the home and workplace is more profitable than the organised exhibitions which have been held from time to time.

The: cottages which adjoin the confluence of the River Thames and River Roding, and have been flooded by water from these rivers, are to be demolished during the years 1956 and 1957. The 50 families in occupation have constituted a colony of people who found themselves, by their location a small self-contained community. A number of tenants have a lengthy family history in that area Creekmouth Hutment Camp It is leasing to record also the re-housing of the 11 families living under unsatisfactory hutment conditions at an exposed position near the river. Information re Local Land Charges, etc. Information as to statutory orders made in respect of dwelling houses and as to notices not complied with requiring works of repair was supplied in respect of 597 properties upon request for official search of the Land Charges Register. In addition, particulars as to properties were supplied in all cases in which mortgages were being arranged under the Housing Act, 1949, in respect of the purchase of small dwellings. Improvement Grants—Housing Act, 1949 (as amended) Enquiries as to improvement grants were received principally from owner occupiers of dwelling houses. Grants for the improvement of housing accommodation were approved in respect of 12 applications, the cost of the work amounting in the aggregate to £4,121 10s. 6d. Improvement grants amounting to £2,169 were granted. Page 29 Default action In 26 instances it was necessary to take action where owners of properties had not carried out the requirements of notices served. Finally, the works were carried out by the owners in respect of 20 dwelling houses. Repairs were carried out by the Corporation at 11 premises in accordance with provisions of Sections 39, 45 and 56 of the Public Health Act, 1936. HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS' ACT 1954. Certificates of Disrepair Five applications were received from tenants, and in two instances Certificates of Disrepair were granted. Owners applied for Certificates of Revocation in respect of five properties where the work had been carried out. Revocation Certificates were issued in all instances. Section C— SUPERVISION OF FOOD SUPPLIES Throughout the year under review much excellent work has been done by the various Food Trade Associations. Nevertheless in spite of this tremendous publicity effort there still remains a lot of work to be done over a very wide field with regard to food health education. The District Sanitary Inspector in his routine inspections is in the best position to impart knowledge to all persons responsible for the handling of our food supplies, as this education is so personal. Generally speaking, it is true to say that equipment in the premises and standards of handling food have been improved immeasurably, if we glance back over the past quarter of a century and compare the conditions of that period with those existing at the present time. The retail food trades are suffering from severe competition in the recruitment and retention of staff, brought about as a result of large industries offering a five day working week with other privileges such as a production bonus for output. Many shops in Barking are small and unless the full complement of staff is constantly present the standard of cleanliness soon deteriorates. The notable increase in the number of refrigerated display cabinets in food establishments and butcher shops is commendable and is Page 30 contributing in no small measure to the general improvement in the presentation of clean, safe food to the public. It is hoped that this trend will continue and become the standard for all cooked foods. As yet we have no shop in the Borough retailing refrigerated pre-packed butchers meat, but it is expected several progressive traders will develop a mode of distribution along these lines. The result, however, may be that there will be little or no difference in the flavour of home killed and frozen or chilled imported meat, where the cutting up and pre-packaging is done some distance away from the place of sale. This is the view offered by the opponents of the scheme. If this method of pre-packing meat becomes fashionable and is accepted by the public as a whole, the enforement of the Merchandise Marks Act and subsequent regulations requiring meat from foreign countries to be marked will be more complicated than hitherto. We are told that the grocery trade sell nearly eighty per cent of its goods in packages. For the consumer, the packaging of food promises quality, purity and freshness, and within certain limits, full weight and measure. In self-service retailing, of course, the package is all important. Not only does the appearance of the package and its label take the place of the salesman in the retail shop, but the wrapping must also be a barrier which will be a safeguard against excessive evaporation, without inducing mould growth, and against decomposition and staleness. Conditions of moisture, humidity, temperature and pressure may be critical for the preservation of foods in the best possible state. There are dangers arising not only from the effect of the packaging material on the food but also from the reverse influence of the food on the container. It is not, therefore, a matter for surprise that great competition in a nearly free industry and the rapid development of self-service in food shops have brought into the limelight new forms of containers and wrappings, and new ways of obtaining freedom from undesirable adjuncts of packaging systems. Pottery, paperboard, plastic films, liquid envelopes, gums, glues and synthetic resins, glass, metals, paper coated with polythene— all these and others were on view at the exhibition organised by the Institute of Packaging. It is doubtful whether metal cans will replace bottles as the usual containers of beer, whilst cardboard as a wrapping for milk seems to have failed to gain favour among retail distributors of milk. The housewife wants a pack which can be opened easily, pours easily and can conveniently be carried in the shopping basket. Page 31 Polythene and polyvinyl chloride films seem to be of special value for protective packaging. Their chemical resistance and water-vapour resistance are said to be better than that of the cellulose acetate film so widely used for transparent wrappings and " windows." Production of many of the flexible plastic films is increasing very rapidly. Electronics, too, can be employed in all the processes of packaging. The outside of packages can be automatically inspected for the presence or absence of labels, and the detection of metallic material in foods can be readily carried out by an electronic metal detector. If food is in metal cans, inspection may be carried out by X-ray fluroscopy. Isotopes are used as monitors to determine whether or not packages are under-filled or over-filled. But not even the most scientific automata can detect whether or not a label complies with the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order and Merchandise Marks Acts. When the human salesman is being replaced so largely by the operation of the self-service system in shops, it is very necessary that manufacturers and packers take all possible precautions to ensure that labels comply with the aw and in no sense mislead the purchaser of packed food— in respect of the nature, substance, quality or quantity of the article in the packet at the time of its sale by retail. It is essential to avoid unwrapping and re-wrapping in the retail shop for the purpose of ascertaining whether weight has been lost while the goods have rested on the shelves. The food packer, anxious to increase the period of shelf-life of his wares, will always need to be careful concerning quality and weight. FOOD PREMISES The following is a list of the various premises in the Borough used for the sale of food. Bakehouses 6 Bread and Cake shops 23 Butchers shops 50 Confectionery shops 98 Factory canteens 49 Fishmongers and Fish Fryers 24 Fruiterers and Greengrocers 45 Grocery shops 69 Ice Cream manufacturers 2 Ice Cream Vendors 135 Milk shops 46 Page 32 Public House and Off Licenced premises 32 Public House Restaurants 9 Restaurants 58 Shops in Markets 46 School Meals Centres and Kitchens 42 Street Traders 17 Inspection of Food Premises During the year the following inspections were made and notices served:— Number of visits made to these premises 1,545 Number of notices of defective or dirty walls and ceilings 43 Number of notices to repair or provide hot water fittings 14 Number of notices to repair counters 10 Number of notices to repair drains 1 Number of notices to provide sinks or wash-hand basins 10 Number of notices to make premises rodent proof 1 Number of notices to remedy defective floors 7 Number of notices to renew defective w.c. pans 3 On occasions the inspecting officers gave verbal notices to remedy minor defects where it was not considered necessary to serve written notices. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT— CHEMICAL ANALYSIS Throughout the year 178 samples of food, described in Table 5, have been submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis. Perusal of Table 5 will show that the foods selected for analysis cover a wide range and type of our everyday foodstuffs displayed for sale. The Public Analyst reported adversely on three samples. As a result two cafe proprietors were prosecuted for selling Hot Milk containing added water, and in the third case Luncheon Meat manufactured locally was reported to have insufficient meat content. There is no standard for this commodity at the present time. Page 33 FOOD SAMPLES REPORTED NOT TO BE GENUINE Sample No. Food Adulteration Action Taken 3789 Hot Milk Added water On prosecution each defendant pleaded guilty and was fined the sum of £3 in respect of each offence 3793 Hot Milk Added water 3730 Luncheon Meat Deficient in meat content Appropriate action taken FOOD PROSECUTIONS AND COMPLAINTS There were fifteen complaints received from local residents regarding articles of food purchased in the Borough. Each case was investigated and in three instances legal proceedings were instituted against the retailers and seven warning letters sent where such action was considered appropriate. Nature of Complaints Result of Action Taken Luncheon Meat containing metal particles Defendant pleaded guilty. Fined £5 Staple in Cake Defendant pleaded guilty. Fined £25 Mouldy Apple Turnover Case dismissed on payment of costs Milk Supplies Our milk supplies continue to be of a very satisfactory bacteriological quality, as is shown in the attached table. There have been 77 samples taken from retailers for Methylene Blue and Phosphatase examination and all have been reported as satisfying the appropriate tests. The sale of Tuberculin Tested Farm Bottled Milk which was retailed in this area by one large distributor has now been discontinued. This means that all the milk sold in the Borough is heat treated and accordingly rendered safe for the consumer.

Throughout the year, 61 samples of Ice Cream and Lollies have been obtain 1 for bacteriological examination, of these all except 5 samples of lollies were reported as being satisfactory. The 5 samples were obtained from one manufacturer. Investigation proved that the "cooler" was at fault. This has now been remedied. There have been 16 samples of Ice Cream and Lollies submitted to chemical analysis. All have been reported as satisfactory and well in advance of the present legal standards. There has been a reduction in the lead content in Lollies and it would appear that manufacturers have now established satisfactory production.

Butchers Shops— Meat Supplies There were 108 visits made during the year to the 50 butchers shops in the Borough. The standards of hygiene vary slightly from shop to shop, but in the main is satisfactory. Butchers respond willingly to any suggestions made to improve either the methods of handling food or the premises in which it is handled. The quality of the meat sold throughout the district is very good and mainly of home killed variety. The provision of a central abattoir for the S.W. Essex area sti remains unsettled. The greater part of the meat sold in our shops is purchased from Smithfield Market.

Section E— SMOKE ABATEMENT Clean Air Bill Early in the year Mr. Gerald Nabarro, M.P. for Kidderminster, introduced into the House of Commons a Clean Air Bill as a private measure to put into effect many of the recommendations of the Beaver Report. The debate which followed the introduction of the Bill, demonstrated the widespread recognition of the need for action. After a full debate the Minister of Housing and Local Government indicated that the Government would undertake to introduce during the Session a comprehensive measure of its own including financial provisions which cannot be included in a Private Members Bill. Page 43 Later the Government introduced the Clean Air Bill which had reached the Committee Stage by the end of the year. The Council's views on various clauses in the Bill were widely circulated and amendments to the Bill were pressed vigorously. The points put forward included:— 1. All users of boiler installations should be required to maintain some form of indicator and recorder for indicating and recording the quality and quantity of the smoke passing up the chimney; 2. There should be a prohibition against the sale of any fuel appliances which are not of an approved quality and performance. Statutory specifications should be issued. 3. The Government should be encouraged to remove the purchase tax on the sale of approved appliances. 4. Hire purchase should be as readily available for solid fuel appliances as they are for gas and electric fitments. 5. That in the "black" areas, special tariffs should be offered to house occupiers who use electricity or gas only for the purpose of space heating. 6. The sale of bituminous coal should be prohibited in smoke control areas as a positive method of preventing the burning of unsuitable fuels in such areas. 7. The sale and export of coke outside the United Kingdom should cease. When the Bill becomes Law it will represent a big step forward towards a cleaner atmosphere but much will depend upon the vigour with which the Local Authorities administer the law and also upon rousing the public conscience so that willing co-operation is forthcoming from everyone whether in the home or in industry. Measurement of Pollution Barking Corporation still co-operates with 223 other bodies nationally in the measurement of atmospheric pollution. Four measuring instruments are maintained in the Borough, and are so sited as to give an indication of the pollution arising in areas of differing character (see map). During the year under review, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research issued a Report on Observations in the ten years ended 31st March, 1954. The Report demonstrated the relationship between the observe trends in pollution and the total amounts of coal used by various classes of consumer. Page 44 Grit and Unburnt Fuel. In spite of a ten per cent increase in the consumption of coal over the ten year period, there was a significant decrease in the amount of unburnt fuel particles deposited. This decrease may be attributed to the efforts made over a number of years to increase the efficiency of combustion in those types of industrial plant which are the usual main source of these deposits. However, this improvement was more than offset by a considerable increase in the deposition of ash, this pollutant also comes largely from industrial boilers. Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide. The trends in pollution by these pollutants appear to have been downward no doubt, arising from improved combustion methods referred to above. A further reduction of smoke and some reduction in the concentration of sulphur dioxide at ground level are likely to have resulted from the increased use of gas and electricity in substitution for domestic coal. Seasonal differences. The results indicated an average increase from summer to winter of seven per cent in deposition of undissolved matter and of twenty-eight per cent in dissolved matter. This observation is in conformity with the view that most of the deposit grit is emitted from industrial installations, the fuel consumption of which shows less seasonal variation than that for domestic heating. Smoke Control Area The Thames View Estate is a smoke control area, it being a condition of tenancy that only smokeless fuel shall be used on the Estate. Some difficulty over the delivery and use of coke were encountered, particularly in the cold weather. Some suppliers alleged there was a resistance by their employees to delivering coke owing to the state of the roads. This hardly seemed valid as they were prepared to deliver coal. The resistance of consumers arose mainly from the delay in delivery, not from an aversion to coke. So far as could be ascertained, there was no shortage of coke in l^e district and it was felt that suppliers could have been more active m maintaining stocks for these customers and that customers could assist by placing orders earlier. Warning letters were sent to offending tenants and the suppliers were invited to co-operate more fully in an effort to make the scheme a success. The matter continues to engage the attention of your officers. Page 45 Industrial Pollution Your officers have carried out 177 observations on factory chimneys to watch for contraventions of the Public Health Act, 1936, and Smoke Byelaws. There were 26 contraventions during the year. Details are shown on page 00. In one instance a number of complaints were received concerning smoke from a factory in which coal was being used to raise steam in a Cornish boiler. The services of the National Fuel Efficiency Service was enlisted and a thorough examination of the plant was carried out. As a result of the Engineers report the Company changed their method of operating the furnace and remedied defects in the boiler setting and installation which resulted in an abatement of the nuisance. There is a certain amount of pollution arising from installations other than boilers fired with coal. The most notable are the furnaces which are fired with wood waste of which there are several in the Borough. In one case as a result of representations made by your officers concerning wood ash emission, alterations were made to the plant and all the boiler house staff attended a course of instruction in boiler house practice. The employers paid expenses and wages for the time spent on the course. In another case, a firm using sawdust as a fuel, undertook to instal a dust extractor to prevent the emission of wood ash from the chimney. Another common source of pollution is the reclamation of scrap metal. Copper and lead are reclaimed from insulated cable, usually by burning off the insulation. This process gives rise to black smoke production due to lack of air supply to the fire. The air supply is restricted so that the temperature of the fire does not become high enough to oxidise the metal. Several firms are carrying on this process extensively and will need to instal some means of consuming the black smoke before discharging the gases to the atmosphere. Fume Emission Following the service of a Statutory Notice by the Corporation, a firm engaged in neutralizing acid which caused nuisance from the evolution of pyridine, re-organised its installation. This has included the erection of a metal chimney 100 feet high through which all fumes evolved are discharged to the atmosphere.

At 211 premises drains were repaired or relaid; four smoke tests were applied to drainage systems and 193 choked drains were cleared. Page 51 Rivers and Streams In a low lying area such as Barking, it is important for rivers and streams flowing through the Borough to be kept within control so as to avoid nuisance and discomfort to the residents. The streams are mainly in the control of the Essex River Board. The River Roding and River Thames, which are both tidal, are supervised by the Port of London Authority. Both the rivers Roding and Thames have been subject to criticism for very many years. This criticism and the activities of the Council have in the past only led to minor improvements. It is important, therefore, to record the major improvement works at the Northern Outfall Works of the London County Council sewage disposal plant. I include a note issued by the London County Council on the 25th June, 1955, which gives details of the changes which are being, or have already been made. Loxford Water. As a further aid to the improvement of the storm water conditions in the Borough, diversion of the Loxford Water into the Roding was completed during the year. This diversion has been made by the construction of a culvert 1,000 feet in length at the rear of Nos. 114-124, Victoria Road and thence as an open stream with a floor and banks constructed in brick and concrete discharging into the River Roding. It was necessary during the construction of this diversion to make provision for an ejector in the main soil-sewer to lift the sewage over the new culvert. The Loxford Water receives storm water from the North end of Staines Road in the Borough of Ilford and carries surface water from that part of Ilford through Barking Park into the River Roding. Rainfall Rain fell during the year on 132 days. The rainfall for the year was 21.61 inches compared with 23.81 inches for the previous year. Northern Outfall Sewage Disposal Works Improvements valued at approximately £5,000,000 carried out by the London County Council were officially opened by the Minister o Page 52 Housing and Local Government, the Rt. Hon. Duncan Sandys, and put into commission in June, 1955. Other improvements valued at £6,500,000 are in the course of construction and when completed will permit of the treatment of a much larger proportion of the sewage reaching the works before its discharge into the River Thames. The improvements were embarked upon by the London County Council as a contribution to the improvement of the quality of the river water in the Thames which has deteriorated in recent years. Barking will benefit from this improvement in the River which has in the past been a source of nuisance, particularly in the summer months. The Main Drainage of London Main drainage in its original sense means the way in which the waters of country run by way of streams and rivers to their ultimate destination, the sea. The earliest sewers serving what is now the County of London were used solely for carrying away surface water from the land and streets and were either natural watercourses flowing to the Thames or ditches oth natural and artificial connecting to them. As London developed, brick sewers, often of large dimensions, were built in the streets and connected to the existing watercourses and streams. As development spread to the banks of the old streams they were bricked in or sometimes, when their courses were tortuous, were diverted to adjacent roads until by the early 19th century they were nearly all below ground. At first, discharge of offensive matter into sewers was prohibited, but about 1815 the water carriage system of house drainage was introduced and a new problem arose. Originally the house drainage was made to discharge to the cesspits already in use, but the great increase in the volume of waste that the cesspits were called upon to take necessitated overflow drains and, with the growth of piped water supply, their connection to sewers was permitted and in 1847, made compulsory. As a result of this change of function of the sewers, the condition of the Thames became intolerable. Page 53 The primary duty laid upon the Metropolitan Board of Works was to maintain the main sewers and to construct works to prevent sewage entering the Thames within the London Area and the following year the Board's Chief Engineer, Joseph Bazalgette, submitted schemes for three intercepting sewers on the North side of the river and two on the South side which were to traverse London roughly from West to East, intercepting the main line sewers on their courses towards the Thames and carrying the flow to outfall sewers which in turn discharged to the river below the County, those on the North side at Barking and those on the South side at Crossness. Pumping Stations were built at Pimlico (Western), Abbey Mills, Deptford and Crossness to lift the sewage. It is interesting to note that the type of plant at all these stations was Beam engines. At the time, Bazalgette's work was considered to be a complete solution to the problem of London's drainage. Normal flow and light rainfall were to be carried to the outfalls and in times of heavy rain, the extra storm flow was to flow over weirs and continue down the course of the old sewers to the Thames. In 1879, however, severe flooding occurred in many districts on occasions of very heavy rainfall and the Board of Works proceeded to construct several storm relief sewers. It seems evident that the Board had begun to realise that a major problem of London drainage was then, as it still is, the disposal of surface and storm water. Soon after its creation in 1889, the London County Council called for a report on the drainage system and new works of considerable magnitude were recommended. Some work was commenced, but in 1897 the then Chief Engineer, Sir Alexander Binnie, again emphasised the urgency stressing the fact that works of considerable size were necessary if the system were not to revert in a large measure to the condition it was before Bazalgette's improvements. Extensive flooding in 1903 led to an enlargement of the original scheme, and by 1914 four new intercepting sewers had been built, the outfall sewers duplicated, four storm water pumping stations built and other storm relief sewers constructed to deal with the increased dry weather flow and storm Page 54 water. The four storm water pumping stations are Lots Road, Heathwall, Falcon Brook and Shad Thames. These works cost approximately £4,000,000 and between 1856 and 1914 about £ 12,500,000 had been expended on London's main drainage system. It had been realised by the Council for some time before the first World War that the provision for carrying away and dealing with storm water had not kept pace with requirements. The increased density of development and the introduction of tar-paved road surfaces had great'iy increased not only the amount of surface water, but also the rate at which it reached the sewers. In 1919, therefore, schemes for further flood relief were investigated and the construction of several undertaken. Many of these were considerably larger than previous ones. The North Western Relief, for instance, is five miles long and at its largest is 9 feet 6 inches in diameter whilst the North Eastern is 4½ miles long and at its outlet 11 feet 4 inches in diameter. At the same time considerable increase in pumping power was provided at existing pi mping stations by installing modern pumping plant in place of that v ich had been working, in some cases, since 1864/65. Notably were the eight electrically driven pumps at Abbey Mills Pumping Station with a total capacity of 224,000 gallons per minute in place of the old Beam engines. In this period between the wars, two new storm water pumping stations were built; the Hammersmith and the Earl, the latter which was only commissioned since the end of the war and as yet has only two pumping sets installed out of the six for which the station is designed. Some ten square miles of London adjacent to the River Thames are below Trinity High Water Mark or below average high tide level in the river, whilst the area below maximum abnormal tides is about twenty-two square miles. All drainage both dry weather and storm flow from these areas has to be pumped. Before turning to a brief history and description of the Outfall Works, it might be mentioned here that the Council takes the dry weather flow from a number of out county Boroughs. The admission of sewage from these Boroughs is governed by Acts of Parliament and the principal condition usually enforced is that the flow shall not exceed fifty gallons per head per day. Page 55 With regard to the Outfall Works, it was Bazalgette's original intention that when the sewage reached the Outfalls at Barking and Crossness, it should be stored in reservoirs on the flood tide and discharged into the river during the ebb tide. For a time these measures sufficed, but it became evident by 1880 that further measures were necessary to prevent undue pollution of the Thames. Sedimentation channels were therefore constructed at the Northern Works and the reservoirs at the Southern Outfall Works turned into sedimentation channels. After chemicals had been added to the sewage, it was allowed to flow slowly through the channels in which a considerable portion of the solids in suspension fell to the bottom and the sewage thus partially purified passed on to the river. Subsequently the use of chemicals was discontinued. The whole of the sewage of London is still partially purified in this manner at both Outfalls. The solids which are thus abstracted, or sludge as it is termed, is further settled in sludge settling tanks and then pumped to the sludge tanks which store the sludge whilst awaiting the ships which take it to the Black Deep well out beyond the Nore Lightship in the, Thames Estuary. These four ships, the Henry Ward, J. H. Hunter, John Perring and the Edward Cruse have a capacity of about 1,500 tons and normally make the round trip in under twelve hours. That is they can make one trip per tide. Owing to various causes, the quality of the river water has deteriorated in recent years and the Council has entered upon a programme of extensive works as its contribution to the improvement of the river. So far activities have been concentrated at the Northern Outfall Works where the need is more pressing. At these Works the whole of the sewage of London, North of the Thames, including that of the out county Boroughs which is admitted, is treated. Five Outfall sewers each 9 feet by 9 feet, discharge to the Works an average daily flow of approximately 200,000,000 gallons. The sewage is settled in thirteen sedimentation channels and some of the effluent discharges direct to the Thames. Some 60,000,000 gallons per day are given further treatment in the Activated Sludge Plant where sewage effluent and activated sludge are mixed in these six sets of aeration channels. The mixed liquor gravitates to these Final Settling Tanks where the activated sludge settles out and the purified effluent discharges to the Thames. A Sludge Digestion Plant utilising two compartments of the old reservoirs to treat 1,200 tons of sludge per day and producing 600,000 cubic feet of gas per day has recently been completed. Page 56 New construction completed at present in hand or proposed includes (1) detritus pits started before the war; (2) the construction of primary sedimentation channels to treat up to 200,000,000 gallons per day; (3) sludge digestion plants to treat up to 4,000 tons of sludge per day, and (4) diffused air plant to treat an additional 60,000,000 gallons of sewage effluent per day. At the Southern Outfall Works the flow of 100,000,000 gallons per day is conveyed to the Works by two Outfall sewers and one high level sewer each of 11 feet 6 inches in diameter. About eighty per cent of the flow is raised by pumps nearly thirty feet and the whole flow is passed through six sedimentation channels where the sludge is settled out and the effluent passed to the river. The sludge is taken to sea as described previously for the Northern Outfall Works. Recent additions include (1) additional diesel driven pumps of a total capacity of 300 tons per minute; (2) electrically driven pumps of a total capacity of 600 tons per minute. New construction at present in hand or proposed ncludes diffused air plant to treat 60,000,000 gallons per day and sludge digestion plant to treat up to 4,000 tons of sludge per day. The Council maintains over 400 miles of main sewers which have to be inspected, cleansed and repaired. SWIMMING BATHS AND SWIMMING POOL I am indebted to the Borough Engineer who has supplied me with the following figures:— Street Baths Total bathers: 72,686, including 42,530 children fork Swimming Pool Total bathers: 99,988, including 64,640 children dipper Baths Total users: 41,166 Samples of baths' water were taken during the year, as follows:— East Street Bath 5 Park Swimming Pool 4 Bath at South East Essex Technical College 12 All the samples were reported by the Borough Analyst to be of a high standard of bacterial purity. Page 57 Water Supply The whole of the water supply for domestic purposes continues to be drawn from the main water supply of the South Essex Waterworks Company. Samples were submitted monthly for bacteriological examination and twice during the year for chemical examination. The whole of the samples were reported to be pure and wholesome. In addition sixteen samples of water from factory wells were found to be satisfactory. Section F— PEST INFESTATION CONTROL The systematic treatment of sewers in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Infestation Control Division) was carried out twice during the year. The results of the treatments are set out below:— May November Number of manholes baited 406 395 Number showing pre-bait take 133 159 Number showing complete pre-bait take 46 106 TABLE 10 Surface Infestation The following information taken from the Annual Report furnished to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for the year 1953, shows the degree of infestation dealt with by the department, the charge for this service is now 5s. 6d. per hour for business premises.

We have not in the post-war period used Hydrogen Cyanide or preparations of Chlordane or Lethane. Section G— ISCELLANEOUS Supply of Dustbins The number of premises where dustbins are supplied and maintained by the Corporation in accordance with Section 75 (3) of the Public Health Act, 1936, was at the end of the year 4,914. The number supplied by the Corporation under this arrangement during the year was 579 whilst 157 dustbins were supplied on payment by eight annual instalments at the rate of 5s. 0d. Page 59 Public Cleansing and Refuse Disposal The Borough Engineer has supplied me with the following information:— The quantity of refuse collected and disposed of throughout the year was 59,504 cubic yards. The average weight, 6 cwt. per cubic yard and the total weight 17,902 tons. In addition, 53,449 tons of refuse were received from other Boroughs. The refuse was disposed of by tipping at Renwick Road in accordance with the provisions of the Essex County Council Act, 1933 (Third Schedule). Pet Animals Act, 1951 Licences were issued in respect of eight premises within the Borough to which twenty visits of inspection were made. Page 69
