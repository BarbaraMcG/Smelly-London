Carshalton Urban Sanitary District. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1894. I.— Vital Statistics: Births and Deaths. 1. The population of the Parish in the middle of the year may be estimated at 5,600 persons. 2. The number of Births registered in the Parish during the year was 162, or four more than in the previous year. The Birth-rate for the year, therefore, was 29.0 per 1,000 of the estimated population. 3. The number of Deaths registered in the Parish during the year was 74, to which must be added seven deaths in the Epsom Workhouse of persons belonging to the Parish. These 81 deaths represent an Annual Death-rate of 14.5 per 1,000 of the population, estimated as above. In the other portions of the Surrey Combined Sanitary District the highest Birth-rate for the year was 24.4, and the lowest was 20.0 ; whereas the highest Death-rate was 13.0, and the lowest was 9.4. 4. As to the Infant Mortality. The deaths of Infants under one year were 23 in number, and were equal to 14 per cent, of the registered births, which is above their previous average rate in the parish. 5. The deaths from Pulmonary Consumption (2 in number) were at the rate of 0.4 per 1,000 of the estimated population, and were below their previous average rate in the Parish. 6. The deaths from other Lung Diseases (Bronchitis, Pleurisy, and Pneumonia) were 14 in number, and were at the rate of 2.5 per 1,000 of the estimated population, which is about their previous average rate in the Parish. (See also Tables I., II.. and V. at the end of the Report.) II.—Summary of Sickness and Mortality from the Seven Principal Zymotic Diseases, and from the other Diseases which must be notified under the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889, and of the action taken for preventing their spread. 1. No case of Small Po.v was reported during the year. 2. Measles were unusually prevalent and caused eight deaths. 3. Whooping Cough caused no death. 4. Scarlet Fever (otherwise called Scarlatina) was notified at six houses, viz.: in January at one in Mill Lane and at one in St. James' Road, in February at one in North Street, in August in one at Batt's Farm, in September at one on the Wrytlie, and in October at one in Mill Lane. There was only one case in each house. Two of the illnesses were contracted out of the district and none of them ended fatally. One of the sick was removed to the Wimbledon Local Board's Hospital, where she was declared not to be suffering from the fever ; she was therefore discharged and went to her home in another district. 5. Diphtheria, Croup and Laryngitis. In August a child living at Wilton Terrace, Beddington Corner, had an attack of Diphtheria which he probably contracted from a visitor in a neighbouring cottage who had had it in London. No other case was notified. No case of Membranous Croup was notified, and no death was attributed to Laryngitis 6. Enteric (otherwise called Typhoid) Fever. Five cases were reported, of which the following are the principal particulars :— Situation of Premises. Persons attacked with Enteric Fever. Probable dates of attacks. 1894 Probable source of Infection and other particulars. Wrythe Lane Boy, aged 13 Jan. 5th The patient came here on a visit on Dec. 20th from Redhill, where he probably contracted the disease. Carshalton Grove Girl, aged 18 April 11th Patient came into residence here on April 9th, from a house where the drains were in very bad condition. Camden Road Gentleman doubtful ; took to bed on Oct. 5th On Sept. 23rd he partook of oysters, which were brought from London on Sept. 22nd. Passed night of Sept. 25th in London. Defects of " drainage " discovered in his house. Westcroft Villas Gentleman uncertain; took to bed on Oct. 27th Patient partook of same consignment of oysters on Sept 23rd, was attacked on Sept. 24th with diarrhoea and vomitting, but apparently recovered from this and was able to perform his usual duties till Oct. 27th. Was removed on Oct. 28th to another district and died there. Defects of "drainage" discovered at bis house. These two gentlemen had visited at each other's houses. The Wrythe Boy, aged 13 Nov. 23rd Defects of "drainage" discovered at his house. Had worked daily at Beddington Corner. Was removed on Dec. 6th to a cottage furnished for him by the Local Board, and died there Dpc. 24th. (3) 7. Diarrhaa caused no death. The total deaths from the Principal Zymotic Diseases were nine in number, viz.: 8 from Measles and 1 from Enteric Fever, and were at the rate of l.6 per 1000 of the population. In the other portions of the Surrey Combined Sanitary District the highest Zymotic death-rate was 1.5 and the lowest was .24. (See also Tables III., IV., and VI. at the end of the Report.) As regards the other infectious diseases which have to be notified under the above-mentioned Act: Three cases of Erysipelas, all occurring among elderly persons, were notified in three houses. No case of Puerperal Fever was reported. The following is a summary of the further action which was taken for preventing the spread of some of these diseases :—The houses infected with Enteric Fever, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, or Erysipelas were visited by the Inspector and myself; isolation of the sick was inculcated; disinfectants for use during illness were supplied and their proper use explained; all nuisances and sanitary defects discovered upon the premises were remedied as far as was practicable ; and, after the illnesses were over, formal notices to cleanse and disinfect the infected rooms and their contents were, in most instances, served on the owners or occupiers. From the houses of the poor the infected bedding was removed and was disinfected by Mr. R. F. Holloway, of Hackbridge, at the expense of the Sanitary Authority. As to the proposed Joint Isolation Hospital. In February the Local Government Board caused an Inquiry to be held at Sutton into the application of the Epsom (Rural), Sutton, and Carshalton Joint Hospital Board (on which the Authority of this district has two representatives), to sanction a loan for the purchase of eight acres of land in the parish of Cuddiugton, as a site for this hospital. The proposal was strongly opposed, among others, by residents in the neighbourhood of the site, by the Conservators of the adjoining Downs, by the Brighton Railway Company, and by the Sutton District Water Company, the latter Company contending (though the land is 2J miles from their works) that the sewage of the Hospital would rapidly find its way, through fissures in the chalk, down to the water level, and would pollute the springs or reservoirs in the chalk from which their water supply is derived. In November, however, the Board sanctioned the purchase of the site for this purpose on condition (1) that the layer of surface-soil, overlying the chalk, on an acre of the land, should be increased to a depth of 4 feet, and that this acre should be used for the purification of the sewage; and (2) that the Joint Board would undertake not to treat cases of Smallpox at the Hospital when any other kind of disease is under treatment there—both of which conditions the Joint Board accepted. Afterwards, as a preliminary to the formal application, they informally submitted plans of the proposed buildings to the Local Government Board, who, at a subsequent conference with a deputation, suggested certain modifications of them, which were to receive the further consideration of the Joint Board. In August the Sanitary Authority, in compliance with the suggestion of the Local Government Board's circular on the connection between Cholera and Diarrhcea, added Diarrhoea, occurring in their district in persons over one year of age, to the list of diseases which were to be notified under the Act during the ensuing three months. No cases, however, were so notified. In December the Authority considered the question of adding Measles to the list of notifiable diseases, and decided not to do so at present. III.— Summary of other Sanitary Proceedings, &c., which were taken during the year. 1, As in previous years, the Sanitary Authority contracted for the removal of house refuse from premises in their district. 2. The slaughter-houses, the workshops and workrooms, the bakehouses, and the premises of the registered cow-keepers, dairymen, and purveyors of milk were inspected. 3. As to the Bye-Laics relating to new streets and buildings : The Surveyor has been good enough to inform me that— In 18H3 In 1884 In 1885 in 188G 1 In '1887 In 1888 In 1889 In 1890 In 1891 n 1892 In 1893 In 1894 The number of new buildings, and of additions to buildings, of which plans were submitted for approval under the ByeLaws, was none 41 9 12 13 9 6 10 12 13 24 54 The number of new streets, ditto, ditto, was none 3 none none 4 4 4 4 nolle 4 none 4 The number of times that legal proceedings were taken for breach of the ByeLaws relating to streets and buildings was none none none none none none none none none 2 none 3 (4) 4. Proceedings under Sees. 150 and 152 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and under the Private Street Works Act, 1892. The Clerk informs me that the number of streets (not being highways repairable by the inhabitants at large) which were sewered, levelled, paved, metalled, flagged, channelled, or lighted, during the year, after notice to their respective frontagers, under these Acts, with a view to their being declared to be highways, was none, as against three in 1884, two in 1886, two in 1887, four in 1888, two in 1889, four in 1890, two in 1891, three in 1892, and one in 1893. 5. As to the proposed Works of Sewerage and Sewage-Disposal. In June, the Sanitary Authority submitted to the Local Government Board plans and estimates of a scheme which had been prepared by Mr. Baldwin Latham, C.E., for laying the necessary sewers in the district, and for treating the sewage on the land in the parish of Mitcham, which the Authority were empowered by Act of Parliament to take for that purpose, and they asked the Board to sanction a loan for the execution of these works. The Board, accordingly in October, caused an inquiry to be held at Carshalton by one of their Inspectors into the matter of the application, and took evidence both in favour of the scheme and against it, but had not given their decision in the matter before the year closed. 6. A sytematic inspection, or house-to-house visitation, of certain parts of the district which are most in need of it, including St. James's Road, St. John's Road, St. Andrew's Road, Levett's Rents, William Street, Harold Road, Wandle Mount, and West Street Lane, was frequently made by the Inspector of Nuisances and myself, and defects of closets, drainage, and dwellings were remedied as far as was practicable. 7. The following is the Sanitary Inspector's return of the Nuisances dealt with, and other work done, during the year ending December 31st:— Number of Complaints received in writing 9 Number of Premises inspected under Section 92 of the Public Health Act, 1875 508 Number of Nuisances discovered. 25 Ditto remedied without being reported 166 Ditto reported to the Sanitary Authority 69 Ditto remedied after report 63 Number of Notices served for the Abatement of Nuisances, under Section 94 69 Particulars of Work done by owners or occupiers, for the Abatement of Nuisances, in compliance with Twtice:— Number of privies, cesspools, ditches, pools, watercourses, urinals, ashpits, and drains, cleansed, and number of deposits removed 147 Number of old privies re-constructed as water-closets 2 Number of old privies re-constructed, with small watertight vaults or with pails Number of Premises at which the drains were re-constructed, ventilated, trapped, or disconnected from the house-pipes or rain-water pipes 32 Number of Premises at which new drains or cesspools were provided under Sec. 23 or Sec. 94 3 Number of Premises from which animals, improperly kept, were removed Number of Houses which were provided with efficient ventilation 4 Number of Houses at which injurious overcrowding was abated 2 Number of damp unwholesome Houses which were repaired 26 Number of filthy Houses which were cleansed and limewashed 17 Legal proceedings taken, under Sec. 96, for abatement of nuisances (number of times) 3 Houses condemned by the Justices as unfit for human habitation, under Section 97 — Number of Samples of Water sent to the Medical Officer of Health for Analysis 2 ,, Wells permanently or temporarily closed, after notice, under Section 70 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as unfit for drinking or domestic purposes ,, Houses to which water was supplied by owners of premises after notice under Section 62 of that Act— E.
