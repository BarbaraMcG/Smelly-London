M ARTIN- IN-THE-FI ELDS FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1871. In conformity with the 198th Section of "The Metropolis Local Management Act," the following Report of the affairs and business of the Vestry during the past year, accompanied by an Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure, duly audited as required by the Act, is made. Vestry Meetings and Committees. The Return attached to this Report will show that the Vestry has held 26 meetings, and the Committees appointed by the Vestry have held 23 meetings during the year. 6 Parliamentary Measures. Two Bills materially affecting the interests of the Parishioners have been introduced into Parliament during the present Session, viz.:— 1. Euston, St. Pancras, and Charing Cross Railway. 2. London Street Tramways (Kensington, Westminster, and City Lines). The first-named Bill affected the thoroughfares of the Parish by stopping up Duke Street, Adelphi, without providing any substitute. The Vestry therefore petitioned against it, and induced the Committee to pass numerous clauses for protecting the interests of the Parishioners, and among other clauses, compelling the Company to make a Carriage-way from the end of Buckingham Street to Villiers Street, and also a Footway from Villiers Street to Buckingham Street; and the Act has, with these Amendments in Committee, received the lloyal assent. The second Bill was intended to authorise the construction of a Tramway, part of a larger scheme, from the Thames Embankment to Charing Cross. The Vestry considering that such a Tramway would obstruct the traffic through Charing Cross, petitioned against the Bill. The result of this opposition has been to induce the promoters to give up that part of the scheme. The portion of the proposed Tramway between the end of Whitehall Place and Charing Cross has been therefore struck out of the Bill, and the Act so amended has received the Royal assent. 7 Sanitary Measures. The Medical Officer's Report is attached, showing the sanitary state of the parish, and the steps taken to improve it during the past year. In connection therewith the Vestry have caused 119 notices for abatement of nuisances to be served during the past year, and 10 summonses have been issued to compel the inhabitants to abate the nuisances complained of. In all other cases the notices have been complied with. Surveyor's report. Under this head, all the works done under the direction of the Vestry will appear. Conclusion. Bound up with the Annual Report will be found a detailed account of the Receipts and Expenditure of the rents and dividends belonging to the Alms Fund in the parish devoted to charitable purposes, and distributed by the Churchwardens in the support of Alms Women and Out-Pensioners elected by the Vestry.

Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin -in-theFields,for the Year 1870. Having been appointed to succeed, as Medical Officer of Health, the late Mr. Beale, who died so recently, I have been requested to furnish a report of the health of this parish for the year 1870. The suddenness of his death prevents it from being so comprehensive as it would otherwise have been. On referring to the monthly reports of the late Medical Officer, I find there have been during the year 592 births, 276 of which were males, and 316 females; this is an increase of 16 on the previous year. The death- c 18 number 620—339 males and 281 females; this is 26 deaths more than the year 1869. In the year 1870 smallpox proved fatal to 3. The late Medical Officer appears to have used his best endeavours in urging re-vaccination to the inmates of those houses in the poor districts in which smallpox had made its appearance. About the middle of the year smallpox was very prevalent in Bedfordbury, owing, no doubt, to the great number of people living in each house, and the want of proper precaution amongst them in guarding against the spread of this scourge. Bedfordbury, as in former years, appears still to be a source of trouble. The habits of the people are so dirty, and the houses old and dilapidated, and not at all adapted to modern sanitary arrangements. The most effectual remedy would be to pull the place down, and construct proper dwellings where cleanliness could be better enforced. Mr. Beale, in his report for August, says:—“I have by frequent inspections endeavoured to improve the condition of the houses in Bedfordbury and adjoining courts, but the population is so great, especially in numbers of children, that the 19 place is no sooner cleaned than it is again made more filthy. The population has been greatly increased by the pulling down of houses for the new Law Courts, many of whose inhabitants came to Bedfordbury and neighbourhood.'' JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 20 BIRTHS and DEATHS, &c., for the last Ten Years. 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 1866 1867 1868 1869 1870 Births 647 588 614 551 579 571 595 670 576 592 Deaths 572 568 593 624 597 566 561 631 594 620 Number of Deaths under 5 years 232 199 192 221 227 203 207 229 185 205 Number of Deaths over 60 years 131 123 114 116 106 119 117 135 139 274 Number of Deaths from 5 to 60 209 246 299 287 264 246 237 279 270 141 Deaths from Smallpox • • 1 12 3 5 2 8 4 0 3 „ Measles 15 6 12 8 17 12 6 13 14 9 ,, Scarlatina 10 37 34 18 13 8 6 22 16 21 „ Whooping Cough 29 12 12 28 25 6 36 10 16 5 ,, Diarrhœa 17 15 18 23 20 24 11 28 17 20 ,, Fever 7 11 53 17 19 16 9 18 10 6 „ Consumption 67 56 65 85 87 81 64 78 67 80 Deaths in the Workhouse 82 67 81 87 91 115 68 82 96 78 ,, in Charing Cross Hospital 64 77 79 85 92 61 61 131 123 122 21 TABLE OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH, AT VARIOUS AGES, In the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, for the Year 1870.

The Vestry having found that several applicants for the Alms Fund preferred receiving the (hit-Pension and living with their friends, instead of residing in the Alms Houses, have during the last few years, elected the most deserving applicants as Out-Pensioners, by which means the Alms' Fund has been distributed between a larger number of Out-Pensioners than formerly. The number of Pensioners on the Fund in March, 1871, were as follows:—40 Almswomen, 11 Married Couples, and 4ti Single Persons Out-Pensioners.
