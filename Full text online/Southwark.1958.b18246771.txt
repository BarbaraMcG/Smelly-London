Telephone: RODNEY 5464 To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Southvark. YOUR WORSHIP, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1958. Vital Statistics Whereas the Registrar General's estimate of the population of the Metropolitan Borough at mid-year 1957 was, at 91,140, the lowest estimate since 1946, the estimated population at mid-year 1958 was still lower. The figure of 89,920 represents a further decrease of 1,220 persons from last year and a decrease of 7,271 from the 1951 census figure of 97,191. The adjusted birth rate of 15.8 per thousand of the population was slightly lower than that for England and Wales which was 16.4. He still-birth rate of 20.1 per thousand total births was lower than that of last year when the rate was 24.7 and lower than the rate for England and Wales which was 21.6. The adjusted death rate of 10.2 per thousand of the population is also lower than the same rate for Southwark in 1951 which was 10.8 and lower than 11.7 for England and Wales. The infant death rate per thousand live births was, at 26.7, rather higher than last year when it was 22.3, and than the rate for the country as a whole. Of the 43 infant deaths, 30 occurred during the first four weeks of life. One death occurred during the year from causes attributable to childbirth. Diseases of the heart and circulatory system were the principal i causes of death accounting for almost fifty per cent of the total. Malignant disease and diseases of the respiratory system followed next, each being responsible for almost the same number of deaths. In regard to the former condition, whereas the number of deaths due to cancer of the lung and bronchus has risen since 1950, the deaths from cancer of other organs has tended to decrease. The result of this is that the death rate from cancer per 1,000 of the population has remained stationary during recent years at approximately 2.2. As Lord Cohen stated recently, "Cancer of the lung is increasing rapidly. It is now the commonest form of fatal cancer, being responsible in Great Britain for 20,000 deaths a year, predominantly in men in the prime of life. Each year the incidence increases by one thousand. There is the strongest statistical evidence to show that the more cigarettes a man smokes the ii more liable is he to develop cancer of the lung, though other factors certainly play a part. Should not the prudent man accept this and act upon it?*. In Southwark in 1950 the number of deaths from cancer of the lung amounted to 47, those due to pulmonary tuberculosis to 51. In 1958 the position had completely altered. Seventy one deaths were due to cancer of the lung and only nineteen to pulmonary tuberculosis. Infectious Disease Measles was more prevalent in 1957 than in 1958 and as a result the total number of infectious disease notifications received during 1958 was substantially lower than during the previous year. Certain features of the diseases notified call for comment. For the first time since 1952 a case of Diphtheria was notified in the Borough. The patient had not been immunised and although, fortunately, at no time was the child seriously ill the occurrence of the case underlines the importance of parents continuing to ensure that their children are immunised against this condition, which can be a serious illness. The resistance of the population can now be raised, by means of vaccination or immunisation, against Smallpox, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Tetanus and Poliomyelitis. In order to reduce the number of injections which a child receives to a minimum, some of these inoculations can be combined. Even so, a considerable amount of effort is called for from parents in ensuring that their children benefit by gaining the immunity against infectious disease which is available. The protection obtained, however, will amply reward the mother's attention to these matters. Two cases of poliomyelitis occurred. Neither case had received poliomyelitis vaccine. One of the patients who suffered from the paralytic form of the disease has now no residual paralysis. The incidence of Whooping Cough was much reduced during 1958, only 64 cases being notified. This was the lowest figure during any of the last ten years. 310 cases were notified in 1948 and here again the effect of immunisation is apparent. Of the alimentary infections, Dysentery unfortunately was prominent during 1958 when there were 230 confirmed cases as compared with 37 cases during the previous year. The control of this infection is essentially a matter of personal hygiene and the importance of hand-washing after visiting the toilet and before meals, or before preparing food, cannot be over emphasised. The condition of some houses and of some schools renders the attainment of even these simple standards much more difficult than it should be. Until more of the slums are cleared and more new schools are built, particular attention must be paid to this problem. Environmental Health The provision of clean water, clean food, clean air and satisfactory housing conditions are the principal objects of environmental health measures. iii Clean Water In London, the Metropolitan Water Board ensures that the puritj standard of water for use for domestic purposes is of a high order. Clean Food The problem of food is more difficult by virtue of its variety and the multiplicity of its sources. During the year the Public Health Inspectors both on the district and at the wharves devoted a great deal of attention to this problem, and as a result of their efforts there is a marked improvement in standards. Certain difficulties are, however, encountered from time to time. In particular I have in mind the large quantities of egg products which are imported through the wharves in Southwark. Some of these products can, under certain conditions, forma suitable medium for the growth of bacteria. In this respect, liquid egg has many similarities to liquid milk. As a result of pasteurisation, designation, and many other far reaching measures, milk is now a pure product which can be consumed with confidence. By contrast it is not unusual to isolate various strains of salmonellae from samples of consignments of egg products coming into this country. During 1958 samples of frozen whole hen egg from two vessels were found to contain salmonella paratyphi B, the causal organism of paratyphoid fever, and both of these consignments were re-exported for pasteurisation. It is of course only practicable to sample a proportion of any given consignment. Fortunately the importers are most co-operative, but even so there is at present always a possibility that at any time some egg product infected with salmonellae may be sold in this country. Egg products are extensively used in the baking trade and certain bakers prefer the imported to the home produced variety. Suitable pasteurising plants are not coming on the market and in the interest of public health there seems little doubt that these products should either be pasteurised, or subjected to some form of heat treatment. The wider adoption of suet measures would, undoubtedly, result in an improved bacteriological standard. Clean Air In my report last year reference was made to the fact that in the early part of 1958 the Council had approved in principle the establishment of a smoke control area in the mainly residential district bounded by Walworth Road, Trafalgar Street, Dawes Street and Westmoreland Road, It was intended that the Order should come into operation in October, 1959. Consequent, however, upon a meeting of local fuel suppliers which was held in the Town Hall in 1958, the Council were not satisfied that ample supplies of smokeless fuel other than coke would be readily available, and being of the opinion that a great many people, especially the aged, are averse to coke fires, decided to take no further action iv in the matter until such time as supplies of smokeless fuel other than coke are freely available in this area. Progress continued to be made during the year in the control of atmospheric pollution from industrial sources as will be seen from the report by Mr. G. Stubbs who carries out this work. Housing In common with several other Central London boroughs, housing presents special problems in Southwark. During the year further progress was made in regard to slum clearance. Detailed consideration was given to applications for rehousing on medical grounds but in the existing circumstances it was only possible to arrange the rehousing of a relatively small number of the families involved. Old People's Welfare The work connected with the welfare of old people continued to be actively undertaken. Details of the efforts made to alleviate the loneliness and improve the health and comfort of the elderly, can be seen from the excellent 8th Annual Report of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee which has been prepared by Miss Beer and which is largely reproduced at the end of this Report. The laundry service for incontinent persons being nursed at home also performed a valuable function throughout the year. This work was undertaken for Lambeth Borough Council as from the 1st May, 1959. The highlight of the year was the decision of the Council to purchase and adapt St. Alban's Hall (formerly St. Paul's School) Penton Place for letting to the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee and other local organisations for social and recreation purposes. This happy solution to the accommodation difficulties of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee will be welcomed by all interested in the welfare of the elderly. It is anticipated that the premises will be available for use by the middle of 1959. In addition to the visiting of the elderly undertaken by Miss Beer and by voluntary workers on behalf of the Old People's Welfare Committee, a great deal of visiting of old people was also undertaken by the Superintendent of the Treatment and Bathing Centre as well as by the Public Health Inspectors in general. Visit of Members of the German Federal Parliament Five Members of the German Federal Parliament visited this country at the beginning of June under the auspices of the Foreign Office to study, amongst other things, the British system of ensuring hygienic food; at the reauest of the Ministry of Health, Southwark was selected as tne authority to show the delegation tne day to day administration of the food laws. The party was welcomed by His Worship the Mayor on Thursday, 5th June, 1958, in the presence of your Chairman. Thereafter the Chief V Public Health Inspector in an introductory talk described the work of the Public Health Department in relation to the importation, storage, wholesale and retail distribution, and sampling of foodstuffs. Sampling equipment for chemical and bacteriological examination, and specimens of unsound food were displayed at the Town Hall. Arrangements were made for the party to visit various food establishments in the Borough. Dr. J. M. Ross, Senior Medical Officer, (Pood) and Mr. T. Morley Parry, Food Hygiene Advisory Officer, both of the Ministry of Health, were present during these visits. The Committee will no doubt be gratified that this visit to the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark was included in the very full programme of these important visitors. Conclusion May I extend my thanks to the Members of the Council for their interest in public health matters and their consideration throughout the year. I am grateful to the Chief Officials for their co-operation. My thanks are due also to the entire staff of the Health Department to whom in their diverse capacities I am indebted for their continued efforts.

Children of school age were mainly affected. Diphtheria For the first time for six years a confirmed case of Diphtheria occurred in Southwark. Fortunately the symptoms in the affected child were minimal. Poliomyelitis An adult and a child, age 3 years, suffered from the paralytic and non-paralytic form of this disease respectively. Neither had been inoculated against the condition. Both patients made a good'recovery. The adult, a man in his late twenties, experienced only a slight weakness of one limb. Whooping Cough 64 cases of Whooping Cough occurred, 50 being under the age of 5 years, and 6 under the age of one year. There were no deaths from this condition. Measles Only half the number of cases of Measles occurred as compared with the previous year. Children under 10 years of age were mainly affected, 42 being under the age of one year. There was one death, in a child under two years of age. 122 patients were admitted to hospital. Erysipelas Of the nine cases of Erysipelas which were notified, two were over 65 years of age and five between 45 and 65 years. Meningococcal Infection Four cases were notified and there were two deaths from this condition, one in a child under one year of age, and one in an old person. Ophthalmia Neonatorum One child was reported as suffering from this condition during the year. 10 Typhoid Fever At the end of the year a child, aged two years, was notified as suffering from typhoid fever. The patient responded quickly to treatment without complications. Detailed investigation failed to reveal the source of this isolated case. Para-typhoid Fever Para-typhoid fever was diagnosed in an elderly woman who had a previous history of the condition. Zymotic Enteritis There were 21 cases of Enteritis, a condition which is notifiable in Southwark during the quarter July to September inclusive for children under 5 years of age. Pneunoiua The 51 cases of Pneumonia which were notified was rather less than the 70 notified during 1957 when Influenza was more prevalent. Puerperal Pyrexia All except one of the thirty notifications of Puerperal Pyrexia were received from hospital. Post Infectious Encaphalitis Encaphalitis is a relatively rare complication of certain of the infectious diseases. This condition developed with fatal results in a child aged five years, who was suffering from Chicken Pox. Scabies Only the first case of Scabies in a household in any four-week Period is notifiable in London and 19 such cases were so notified. 11 Dysentery During 1958, no fewer than 230 confirmed cases of Dysentery occurred in the Borough. This figure compares with 37 cases in 1957, and 716 cases the year before. 20 of the patients were under one year of age, 106 between one and five years, and 39 of compulsory school age. 196 of the cases were admitted to hospital. Food Poisoning There were 42 cases of Food Poisoning and nine persons were admitted to hospital on this account. There were three cases in each of two families, and two cases in each of six families. Twenty-four were single cases. Salmonellae of various strains constituted the causal organism, in 30 instances.

LIoyd T.D.) The total treatments of individuals for vermin infestations during 1958 were only slightly less in number than in the previous year. The more common kind of infestation dealt with is that of the head louse and in the case of school children of both sexes, infestations are almost exclusively of this type. This is also the case with most adult females requiring treatment. With regard to adult male persons, there were no cases of infestation with head lice. The types of vermin infestations dealt with being body and pubic lice. The majority of male persons attending for treatment are sent from the various lodging houses and hostels situated in the Borough area. The number of individuals requiring treatment for scabies was below the number treated during 1957. When a case of scabies is notified in a family, efforts are made to induce the whole of that family in immediate contact to attend for treatment on the same day. Since the laundry service, commenced in June last year, has been in operation, 77 individuals in all have received the service. Of this number some have, unfortunately, since died and others are in and out of hospital, but an average number of 25 persons receiving the service each week is maintained. In many cases the incontinent laundry is collected and delivered 3 times a week. By arrangement between the two authorities, incontinent laundry from the Lambeth Borough area is now laundered at our centre. There was a considerable increase this year in requests for assistance in dealing with infestations of insect pests in domestic premises. The majority of the calls were in regard to bed-bug infestations, but £ number of beetle, cockroach, flea, fly and other infestations also received attention. A major and deep seated infestation of cockroaches was dealt with in some old institutional buildings situated within the Borough. When cockroaches become established in such places where there is central heating, they are difficult to eradicate entirely and complete disinfestation was only achieved with considerable effort and the application of suitable insecticides in some quantity. Reported infestations of Wharf borer beetles, (Nacerda melanura) a wood boring beetle, in buildings with solid floors throughout, at first caused some concern. However, on inspection, it was found that in each case the vertical plumbing pipes had, in accordance with modern design, been constructed to have internal connections with the horizontal drains. The wood beetles had apparently travelled along the lines of pipe from some sub-soil source, and had thereby gained entry to the interior of the buildings. 18 Infectious Disease Cases : Enquiries and Visits Total - 392 as under: Tuberculosis deaths and removals - 25 Scarlet Fever 153 Food Poisoning 27 Poliomyelitis 4 Erysipelas 8 Enteritis 1 Diphtheria 2 Dysentery (bacilliary) 166 Meningococcal infections 5 Typhoid fever 1 Disinfection following infectious diseases Rooms treated (Formalin solution) .. .. .. .. .. 249 Library books treated .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 136 Other disinfection.

Six premises are registered for the use of filling materials,, and two licensed for manufacture or storage of Rag Flock. WELL WATER The three private wells in the Borough are still in use for industrial purposes. The supply in each case is satisfactory. 27 HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS In accordance with Section 18 of the L. C.C. (General Powers) Act, 1954, relating to hairdressers and barbers' establishments, one such premises was registered during the year. Ctoe establishment was demolished and as a result of legal proceedings, one registration was cancelled. The total premises registered at the end of the year were 69. BYE-LAWS FOR LIGHTING OF COMMON STAIRCASES Objections were made to the Minister of Housing and Local Government by certain local property owners against the Council's bye-laws for the artificial lighting of common staircases. The Minister felt that a discussion of the matter with representatives of the Council and the objectors would be advantageous, and after hearing the views of all parties the Minister decided that he was not justified in withholding his approval, and accordingly the bye-laws were confirmed and came into operation on the 1st October, 1958. As from that date the owner of every block of flats must provide adequate artificial lighting for all common staircases from half-anhour before sunset until midnight, for one hour before sunrise during the months of October to March inclusive, and at other times as and when necessary if adequate means of natural lighting are not provided. The bye-laws apply similarly to tenement houses, that is to say, houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, but only if the Council serve a notice on the person having control of the lettings requiring him to provide and maintain adequate artificial lighting of common staircases. RESIDENTIAL CARAVANS - PROPOSED LEGISLATION The London County Council proposed to include a provision in their next General Powers Bill making it an offence to occupy a caravan (or other temporary or moveable dwelling), or to permit the use of any site for such purpose, except in accordance with the terms of licences to be obtained in advance from the metropolitan borough council. Borough councils will be required to consult the London County Council before granting any licence authorising the use of a site for caravans, etc. 28 LITTER The Litter Act 1958, which came into force on the 7th August, 1958, lays down a penalty, on summary conviction, of a fine not exceeding £10 if any person creates a litter, into or from any place in the open air to which the public are entitled or permitted to have access without payment. Without prejudice to the powers of any other persons. Local Authorities including Metropolitan Borough Councils have power to institute proceedings. It is open to any private individual and to the Police to institute proceedings. During the year the Secretary of State confirmed a new Southwark bye-law which came into operation on August 1st 1958, making it an offence to deposit any rubbish or waste matter creating or tending to create a litter on the highway. DRAINAGE WORK The London County Council (General Powers) Act of 1958 provides that Section 44 of the Public Health (London) Act 1936 - empowering borough councils by agreement with the owner or occupier of premises, and at his expense, to construct or alter any drain - be extended to include the laying, repair, cleansing or filling up of any drain. SHOPS ACT, 1950 Hitherto the Council's functions under Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950, have related only to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of sanitary conveniences. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1958, provided for the extension of these duties, from January 1st 1959, to include the lighting of shops and ??? of facilities for washing and the taking of meals. 29 FACTORIES ACTS Three hundred and fifty-three inspections of Factories were made during the year, and 10 notices were served. There are now 1,003 factories of all types on the register, comprising 248 factories without mechanical power, 732 with mechanical power, and in addition 23 building sites, for which a further 40 inspections were made, but no notices served.

Stubbs) The noticeable feature of the figures recorded by the Council's instruments was the considerable decrease in the; amount of smoke. No doubt this was principally due to the reduction in the consumption of domestic coal. The overall figures for deposited matter for the Borough show little variation from the previous year, and the amount of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere had slightly increased. The graphs on the following pages illustrate the results since the instruments were installed in January 1950. Representations were made to the Central Electricity Authority in the early months of the year in regard to the heavy amounts of grit deposited in the Bankside area. The Central Electricity Authority stated they were compelled to make use of the old Bankside Power Station at that time, but it was the intention to take the old station out of service in March 1959 and that demolition would follow forthwith to facilitate the completion of the new Power Station. Several complaints were received of smoke emissions from the burning of trade wastes in incinerators. On investigation it was generally found that the incinerators needed renovation or were being overloaded. Newly installed oil-fired furnaces in commercial buildings were the subject of some complaints but adjustments to the installations soon ended the smoke nuisance. The Minister of Housing & Local Government provisionally approved the Council's proposals for the Smoke Control Area No. 1, and a detailed survey of the area was commenced. The area in question is mainly residential and is bounded by Walworth P.oad, Trafalgar Street, Dawes Street, Portland Street, Westmoreland Road, covering 36.5 acres. Preliminary arrangements were made for a Clean Air Exhibition to be held at the Newington Public Hall, Manor Place. A meeting of coal merchants operating in Southwark was held in the Town Hall under the Chairmanship of the Medical Officer of Health, and was attended by representatives of seventeen local fuel merchants, the Coal Utilization Council, The Society of Coal Merchants, the SouthEastern Gas Board, the National Coal Board and the Ministry of Power. Details were given of the proposed smoke control area and there was a discussion on the availability and distribution of the various types of smokeless fuels. It was stated that coke would be the only smokeless fuel readily available during the winter months and that supplies of premium fuels could not be assured. The Council gave further consideration to the question of fuel supplies and decided not to proceed with the proposed Smoke Control Area until supplies of smokeless fuels other than coke are freely available in the Borough. 31 During the year fourteen notifications were received of proposals to install new furnaces, and plans and specifications in respect of two other installations were submitted and approval given. One other application for approval is the subject of negotiations with the firm. The Council has in use two Standard Deposit Gauges, three Lead Peroxide Instruments and one Smoke and Volumetric Sulphur-Dioxide apparatus. The Central Electricity Generating Board has two Standard Deposit Gauges in Southwark and has installed a Lead Peroxide Instrument on the jetty of the Bankside Power Station. During the year 19 complaints were received regarding smoke emission, 245 observations and inspections were made by the Inspector 12 Intimation Notices issued. It is pleasing to record that the managements were co-operative on all occasions and it was not necessary to institute legal proceedings. 32 SULPHUR DIOXIDE 'Lead Peroxide Method) (mgm.

The consignments imported were as follows:- Description Tonnage Fresh & Chilled Meat 59,220 Meat Products etc 21,940 Offal 8,789 Poultry & Rabbits 1,827 Bacon 173 Butter 38,794 Margarine 2,995 Lard 7,684 Milk Products 3,374 Egg Products 4,155 Cheese 16,262 Fresh Fruit 55, 003 Dried Fruit 7,288 Canned Fruit 35,133 Purees, Pulp & Fruit Juices 2,353 Fresh Vegetables 23.962 Canned Vegetables 2,006 Canned Fish 12,989 Preserves 1,594 Cocoa Butter 513 Des.

IN FOOD) REGULATIONS, 1925 TO 1953 Honey A consignment comprising 200 casks of Jamaican Honey was detained because the barge which contained this consignment became water-logged and the cargo was completely submerged. Ten of these casks were released for refining purposes. Samples taken from them after heat treatment gave satisfactory results and the remainder of the consignment was released for the same process. Egg Products Apart from direct importations into the Borough, large consignments have been transferred into Southwark wharves and warehouses from other parts of the Port of London. Close control has been maintained, and routine samples have been drawn for bacteriological examination from all consignments. In cases where results have revealed the presence of Salmonellae, the egg products have been released in the main for pasteurisation, and large quantities have been exported to Hamburg for 42 this purpose, smaller quantities having been released to industry where they would not be used in the preparation of food. In accordance with the arrangements for the heat treatment of egg albumen, batches have been examined before and after heat treatment, and the results of this process have been wholly satisfactory. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT, 1926 At the time of inspection of foodstuffs on importation, and in shops and on street stalls, attention has been given to the requirements relating to Indication of Origin. Most products to which the Act applies, including meat, oat products, and dried fruit appear to have been satisfactorily marked. There have been numerous occasions when the vendors have had to be requested to indicate the origin of tomatoes and apples, but legal proceedings have not been necessary. UNSOUND FOOD During the year 132 tons 12 cwts. 3 qtrs. 3 lbs. of food examined at wharves, warehouses and shops were found unfit for human consumption and disposed of as follows:- Food condemned at wharves and warehouses: - Destroyed: Tons Cwts.

Most of the dealers sold only pre-packed ice-cream, obtained from the large manufacturers. 31 samples of ice-cream were taken with the following results:- 26 samples, Grade I 2 samples, Grade II 3 samples, Grade III In addition: 31 samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition, one sample was found to be 5 percent deficient in fat, but subsequent samples taken from the same source were satisfactory 44 Periodical inspections were made to all premises and copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. In the case of Grade III samples, special investigations were made at the premises in an effort to detect the causes of the unsatisfactory gradings. DESIGNATED MILK The following Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1954 and Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953:- 154 Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 171 Dealers' Licences for Sterilised Milk. 110 Dealers' Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Twenty eight samples of Designated Milks were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination, all of which satisfied the prescribed tests. Twenty seven samples of Pasteurised milk supplied to local schools were also examined by the Public Analyst, and the London County Council were informed of the results which were satisfactory in each case. MILK SELLERS At the close of the year there were 152 registered milk distributors in the Borough, whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the Borough from registered precises elsewhere was 20. 287 inspections of Milkshops and Dairies were made during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS Four samples of condensed milk were purchased for analysis pnder the above regulations. They were all certified by the Public Analyst to comply with the regulations. 45 BAKEHOUSES At the end of the year there were 17 Bakehouses in use in Southwark, of which 3 were Basement Bakehouses. Sixty six inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors. SLAUGHTERHOUSES There are now no slaughterhouses in the Borough. CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 413 catering establishments in the Borough. These include riverside snack bars, cafes, coffee stalls, mobile snack bars, public house restaurants, and industrial canteens. All have received systematic inspection and close supervision during the year, and a satisfactory standard has been maintained. REGISTRATION OF FOOD PREMISES (Food and Drugs Act, 1955) There are now 84 premises registered for the purpose of the Preparation or Manufacture of Sausages or Potted, Pressed, Pickled or Preserved Food intended for Sale. IMPORTATION OF MEAT UNFIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION Representations were made by the Council to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee that meat imported into this country for animal consumption should be sterilised, coloured and packed to inaicate tnat it is unfit for numan consumption. The Standing Joint Committee made similar representations to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, who have stated that the whole question is under consideration. 46 FOOD HYGIENE (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 1957 Regulations have been made which will provide that the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, forbidding a person carrying on a food business to give out food for preparation or packing on domestic premises shall not apply to the peeling of shrimps, prawns and onions, but domestic premises where such work is carried on must be registered with the local authority and certain other requirements complied with. There requirements include (a) a periodic check by the person giving out the food that the worker is able to maintain proper standards, (b) the cleanliness of equipment and premises, (d) the protection of food from risk of contamination and (e) the observance of cleanly practices by persons engaged in the handling of food and the action to be taken where they suffer from, or are the carriers of certain infections. SLAUGHTER OF PIGS (ANAESTHESIA) REGULATIONS, 1958 These Regulations permit the use of installations for the anaesthetising by carbon dioxide of pigs before slaughter. This process has not hitherto been legal in this country, although it has been used elsewhere. The Regulations lay down requirements which must be observed in the design and operation of installation in order to prevent the infliction of unnecessary suffering on the pigs. TOILET FACILITIES IN RESTAURANTS The Metropolitan Borougns' Standing Joint Committee at their meeting on the 14th April, 1958 were recommended to ask the London County Council to incorporate in the next General Powers Bill a clause empowering metropolitan borough councils to require the proprietors of public houses, cafes, restaurants and places of public entertainment to provide sanitary conveniences for their customers. Local authorities outside London already have this power under the Public Health Act, 1936, which is not applicable to London. 47 POOD SHOPS Public houses 164 Cafes 129 Factory canteens 120 Butchers 47 Fish shops (wet and dry) and fried fish shops 58 Bakehouses 17 Greengrocers 52 Grocers 123 Ice-cream dealers and manufacturers 276 Schools providing food 50 Milk distributors 152 ANALYSIS OF WORK CARRIED OUT IN FOOD PREMISES Food rooms repaired and redecorated 178 Equipment provided or improved 95 Lighting improved 32 Ventilation improved 41 Food cupboards provided 35 Refrigerators provided or repaired 19 Accommodation for clothing improved 30 Wash-hand basins provided or renewed 20 Hot water supplies provided 24 Sinks provided or renewed 30 Sanitary conveniences repaired and redecorated 74 Drainage systems repaired or improved 36 Roofs and gutters repaired 22 Yards repaired and cleansed 37 Accumulation of refuse removed 47 Dustbins provided 34 48 FOOD SAMPLING 453 formal samples and 746 informal samples were submitted to the Public Analyst.

WELFARE OF THE AGED The following is an extract from the Annual Report of Miss D. Beer, A.I.S.W., Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's welfare Committee:- 52 "We present the Eighth Annual Report for the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee for the year 1958/1959, and in doing so we would like to express our gratitude to the Borough Council for its valuable support and for the generous grants which it has made to us during the past year. To the Mayor for his support and encouragement. Also to all those both young and old who have given their practical help to the aged in so many different ways. We are very happy to say that this will be our last report in our present cramped quarters. Every year we have closed our annual report with the words that we could do more if we had the room. Soon we shall be getting that extra room. In June we hope to move into St. Albans Hall, Penton Place, where there will be plenty of room to expand the service to the aged in the Borough of Southwark. This thickly populated area is full of tenement buildings, and poverty, loneliness and ill-health still abound in spite of many Welfare Services; so often loneliness being accoraoanied by a loss of personal pride is the insidious cause of ill-health. Among old people we find that friends have died, relatives have moved away and it is difficult for'them to make new friends, so the old folk become more and more left to themselves, thinking about the past. Some neglected people become dirty in their habits, careless about their personal appearance, and for them senility comes along rapidly. But most of them are fighting bravely, and there is no courage in the world greater than this endless heroism'of the aged. Visiting in this area is a most important part of our work, it can never be hurried, and we try patiently and lovingly to get to know all about the lonely ones; their families, now scattered; the beloved wife or husband who is no longer alive; so that they can talk to us as friends who know and understand their loneliness. To all those who read this report we would say; can you find time to befriend an old person? To visit regularly, to tell about your family and its doings, to get your family interested too. We feel very strongly that if every lonely old person could be adopted by a family, half the problems of old age would be over come. This year has been a very busy one, 1,039 old people have come to us for help, many of them with problems which seemed at first insoluble, but after a time, with careful thought, investigation, and in some cases discussions with members of the family, a solution has been found and the old person made happy and contented. In many cases when an old person is too infirm or senile we are made their agents to draw their pension and to pay their weekly expenses. Housekeeping - as every housewife will know - is not an easy task, especially when there is only the age pension, and after weekly expenses are paid, it is very often difficult to find enough cash for the little extra which we know they will look for when we take the shopping home to them. 53 Restaurant and Meals-on-Wheels Service The Restaurant continues to open early in the morning providing hot coffee and biscuits. Many of the old people bring their breakfast to have with their coffee round the fire. This service is very popular and continues to grow. Some old people coming to the Gate House for advice stop for a cup of coffee and make new friends and in many cases these new friendships do far more for them than all the advice we car give. The Meals-on-Wheels service to the home-bound is still the highlight of an otherwise dull and monotonous day for many. This year we have lost a lot of old people who have been having meals since the service was started. The very long cold spell after Christmas took a heavy toll of the over eighties, but many new ones have been added to our list so that we are still working to capacity. The Restaurant is still very popular. Although the first sitting is not served until 12.15 every chair is taken by 11 a.m. and we are looking forward to having seating capacity for everybody at once when we move, so that nobody will have to wait in a queue for a second sitting. The Women's Voluntary Service continues to provide transport and helpers to cover the north of the Borough and their two vans are still working to capacity. We are very grateful to Mrs. Meekins and her helpers for this service which they render so faithfully. During the year we found it necessary to close the luncheon club at the Church of the Lady Margaret, Chatham Street, but the luncheon club at the Women's University Settlement is still very popular and is very much appreciated by the old people in that area. 69,127 meals were cooked and served, in the restaurant, at the Luncheon club and by Meals-on-Wheels during the year. Transport Our transport service is growing much more rapidly than we can cope with it. Now that it is known that we will arrange transport for an old person to visit a sick relative in hospital, or to be helped on any journey which they must take, we get many requests. Our cry is for more voluntary drivers who are free during the day. We would like to take this opportunity of thanking P.C. Dunn who gives up so much of his spare time to this work. Also to Mr. Warhurst who, until his illness did so much driving. We look forward to the time when he will be fit enough again to help us. Chiropody Foot clinic day is still an important day in the lives of many of the old people. And the clinic is still ably looked after by Miss Addiscott who is friend to all who attend. A car ride, a chat with old friends plus a great improvement in their walking means a lot to the homebound. We are getting more applications than we can deal with at the 54 moment and our domiciliary service can now only be a three monthly one. We are anxious to know bow the new free service, just announced by the Government, will affect our present arrangements - and expansion of the service is being held up until it has been decided how this new service will be operated. We would like to express our thanks to the Southwark Division of the British Red Cross Society for arranging the transport for the clinic. Outings Outings from the Gate House have been numerous during the year. Coach trips to Brighton, Bexhill, Southend, Chichester, Wittering, Albourne, Palladium, and Streatham Hill Theatre have been some of the high lights, and many parties and entertainments have been held at the Gate House. Choir Festival The Festival for old people's choirs for South London was held in Crossways Mission this year and for the first time Southwark took part. Fifteen members from the Gate House Club entered and sang "The Sailor from Sea" which was the set song and "Crimraond" which was their own choice. Miss P.P. Buxton a member of the Chelsea Branch of the British Red Cross Society trained and conducted them and Mrs. Gates accompanied them on the piano. They have entered again this year and are at the moment busy practising. This year the Festival is being organised by the Old People's Welfare Committee. Seaside Holidays On Saturday, 2nd May, 118 old people went to Bognor for a two weeks' stay by the sea. The party included two old people from Courbevoie, a suburb of Paris, with which the Borough of Southwark twinned several years ago. They were received with open arms by the Southwark Old People and enjoyed their stay very much indeed. This year we were able to take three very severe arthritics and they were accommodated in a convalescent home belonging to the Bermondsey Medical Mission. They were taken down in our own car and taken out for drives during the fortnight. They were also taken to join the rest of the party for special parties and functions arranged for their entertainment. We feel very strongly that these old people who are so badly crippled with arthritis need the holiday as much, if not more, than many of the more able-bodied, but it is very difficult fitting them into the hotels because there is very little ground floor accommodation. We have booked several places in the convalescent home again this year. We are indebted to the Mayor of Southwark for his grant of £300 which enabled the committee to make the holiday available to so many for so low a cost. 55 Comforts Fund This year we have supplied, out of our comforts fund, many kinds of invalid foods - blankets - sheets - coal - fireguards - budgerigars - curtains - clothing - convalescent holidays, etc. Also many gifts of flowers, fruit and sweets when visiting old people in hospital. When we get a request for help and we know that it is genuine we always help and we are able to do this because of the generosity of those who have sent donations to the Old People's Welfare Committee during the year. May we ask that many more people will give generously during the coming year to help us to carry on this very important piece of work. Christmas Party On Friday evening 19th December, a party was organised for homebound old people by the Mayor of Southwark and some friends of his at the English Martyrs Hall, Stead Street. There was plenty of tea for everybody, followed by an entertainment. Many friends offered their cars to transport the old people to this party and our grateful thanks go out to all of them ." 56 MORTUARY Post-mortems without Inquest 910 Post-mortems with Inquest 159 Inquests without Post-mortems Inquests, Post-mortems held elsewhere 1 Bodies brought in for convenience 1 Infectious disease deaths 1 1,071 Bodies brought to Southwark Mortuary:- From Private addresses From Hospitals Southwark 115 18 Lambeth 235 131 Camberwell 225 212 Bermondsey 81 54 Total 656 415 Bodies brought from hospitals: - Guy's Hospital 17 Southwark Evelina Hospital 1 Lambeth Hospital 65 Lambeth South Western Hospital 13 St. Thomas' Hospital 48 Waterloo Hospital 4 Belgrave Hospital 1 St. Giles' Hospital 83 Camberwell St. Francis' Hospital 20 Dulwich Hospital 100 King's College Hospital 9 St. Olave's Hospital 54 Bermondsey Total 415
