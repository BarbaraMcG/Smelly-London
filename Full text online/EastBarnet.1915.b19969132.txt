EBAR 036 Forty-second ANNUAL REPORT. of the HEALTH and SANITARY CONDITION of the EAST BARNET VALLEY URBAN SANITARY DISTRICT. for the year 1915. by WALTER ROUGHTON, E.R.C.S. (ENG.) (Diplornate in Public Health) MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. REPORT. To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Valley Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I herewith present the forty- second Annual Report on the Health of the District for the year 1915. To save expense this Report has not been printed as heretofore, but is type Written, and is also more condensed than usual. POPULATION. The estimate of the population is supplied by the Registrar General and is given at 12595. Very few soldiers have been quartered here during the year. BIRTH RATE. 225 births were registered giving a birth ra,te of "18 per 1600. DEATH RATE. The numbers of deaths registered as having actually occurred in the District is 109 which gives a death rate of 8.6 per 1000. Of this number two deaths were of Non-Residents, but in addition 21 deaths of Residents occurred outside the District making the Nett total 123, which fives a nett death rate of 10.1 per 1000. This rate multiplied by the factor .9935 ( as in previous Reports) gives a corrected rate of 10 per 1000 for the year 1915. INFANT MORTALITY Rate of deaths under one year of age per 1000 births registered. Under the heading 8 deaths were registered, a rate of 35.5 per 1000. MEASLES AND WHOOPING COUGH. Five deaths were due to Measles and one to Whooping Cough. Both diseases were fairly - prevalent in the early part of the year. SCARLET FEVER. Twenty-five Cases were notified. Of this number 16 occurred in a large private school during the month off May. Of the remainder, occurring in various parts of the District, 7 were removed to the Isolation Hospital. ENTERIC FEVER. One case of Enteric Fever occurred in a soldier admitted to St James Hospital. The patient arrived with the disease upon him and was transferred to the Isolation Hospital. TUBERCULOSIS. Se??? deaths were caused by Phthisis and one by other Tuberculous; cases. Nine new cases of Pulmonary Phthisis were notified. A Tuberculosis Dispensary was established at the Council Offices and weekly visits were made by the Assistant County Tuberculosis Officer WATER SUPPLY ETC. The remarks made in last years Report regarding Water Supply,Milk Supply,Bakehouses and Slaughter Houses still hold good. This also applies to the Isolation Hospital. HOUSING AND TOWN PLANNING. The work under the Act of 1909 was considerably restricted by order of the Council in the early part of the year. The inspections were continued as before but the extent to which "Notices" were enforced was left to the joint discretion of the Medical Officer and the Sanitary inspector. But since July no notices were issued and towards the end of the year the work ceased on the Sanitary Inspector being released by the Council to take up War Service. I append a summary of work done under the Act by the Sanitary Inspector. Number of houses inspected during 1915 under, and for, the purposes of Section 17 of the Act of 1909 226. Number of Dwelling Houses (or parts of dwelling houses) '•"hich on inspection were considered to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. 3. Number of representations made to Local Authority, with a view to making Closing Orders. 0 Number of Closing Orders made 0. Number of Dwelling Houses, the defects in which were remedied with out/miking of closing orders 94. Number of Dwelling Houses, which, after the making of Closing Orders were put into a fit state for human habitation. 0. @ It should be noted that this figure includes 43 houses in respect of which notices were issued in 1914 but had not been comnlied with during that year. The following short summary will show how the property inspected during the year has been dealt with by the Inspector, viz:- Number of Dwelling Houses inspected 226 Number of Notices issued 58,affecting 163 houses Number of premises not requiring Notices 63 Number of premises respecting which notices had not been issued at the end of the year 63 Total 226 COLLECTION AND DISPOSE OF REFUSE. The L.G.B, circular on this subject was considered by the Council in June. Certain recommendations as to the Collection of household refuse were ordered and a large number of Posters and Handbills explaining the danger due to flies were distributed throughout the District, But in my opinion not sufficient attention was given to the necessity of enforcing the Bye-laws as to providing proper receptacles for manure and the regular removal of the contents thereof. Manure heaps are the breeding grounds of flies and the utmost attention is necessary to prevent them from being a danger to the Public Health. TABLE 1.
