Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my report for the year 1957. The health of the community continues to be satisfactory. The infantile mortality which indicates the deaths of children under one year of age was 17.3 per thousand live births, which compares very favourably with the national figure for England and Wales of 23 per thousand. On analysing the causes of death in other age groups it is gratifying to notice that there were no deaths in the school group (5 to 15 years). Coronary thrombosis is the main single cause of death which predominates in the age groups above 45 years of age, and it may be surprising to some to note that coronary thrombosis now shares with malignant neoplasm the position of chief cause of death in the 25 to 45 age group. Infectious diseases continue to decline, new cases of Tuberculosis being the lowest ever recorded. With the exception of Poliomyelitis none of the common notifiable infectious diseases was listed as a cause of death, and it is anticipated that the increase in the number of children being vaccinated against poliomyelitis will make it only a matter of time before this disease is also brought under control. At the beginning of October there was an outbreak of Influenza which became widespread but was mild in type and in the majority of cases lasted only a few days with a quick recovery. With the help of the Colindale Public Health Laboratory the virus was typed and found to be of Asian strain. The work of business and industry was seriously hampered by the incapacity of a large number of people at the same time—an example of this is shown in the fact that at the beginning of October there were 60 cases of Influenza among the staff of the Barnet Hospital Group. During the month that the epidemic continued there were three deaths from Influenzal Pneumonia—two being aged persons and one a child under three months of age. During the year the Public Health Committee decided to introduce a laundry service for incontinent aged persons. This was done 5 to avoid the necessity which frequently arises to admit such persons to hospital. A twice weekly collection of soiled laundry and delivery of clean laundry was instituted. This service is entirely free and will be made available to any patient on the application of the family Doctor or relative. Work on Food Hygiene continues and the statistics in the body of this report will show the work done by Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the provisions of the Food Hygiene regulations were carried out in shops in the Borough. In one case it was necessary to prosecute the owner of a shop for failing to provide facilities for washing equipment, and a fine was subsequently imposed. However, the vast majority of Food Traders accepted the fact that the regulations were designed to protect the public from food infections and willingly complied with the regulations. I would like to end by giving my sincere thanks to the Staff of the Health Department for their loyal and cheerful assistance throughout the year and to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their continued encouragement and support. A. W. HAY, Medical Officer of Health (until 30th April, 1958). 6 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,478 Population, 1957 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 69,380 Number of Inhabited Houses (at 1st April, 1957) 20,115 Rateable Value (at 1st April, 1957) £1,371,658 Product of a Penny Rate, year 1957/58 £5,610 Total Live Births 925 Birth Rate per 1,000 home population 13.3 Birth Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 16.1 Total Stillbirths 14 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 14.9 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births (England and Wales) 22.4 Total Deaths 781 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 home population 11.3 Standardised Death Rate 10.3 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 11.5 Infant Deaths 16 Infant Mortality Rate 17.3 Infant Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 23.0 Neo-Natal Deaths 14 Neo-Natal Mortality Rate 15.1 Neo-Natal Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 16.5 Maternal Deaths 1 Maternal Mortality Rate 1.06 Maternal Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 0.47 Live Births: Males Females Total Legitimate Illegitimate 468 14 421 22 889 36 482 443 925 Birth rate 13.3 per 1,000 estimated home population.

During the year 28 children were immunised by General Practitioners and 115 by Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. In addition, 546 children were immunised with a combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic, 379 by General Practitioners and 167 by the Local Health Authority. Three hundred and forty-six children were given "booster" doses of diphtheria prophylactic alone, and 37 children were given "booster" doses of combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. Scarlet Fever There were 71 cases of Scarlet Fever, 37 more than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis During the year, twelve cases of Poliomyelitis were notified to me, and of these, 11 were found to be suffering from the paralytic form. One male, aged 29 years, died. The death of a man, aged 32 years, who died outside the district was also allocated to Finchley 18 The Council have continued to grant to the Octopus Club the use of the Squires Lane Bath on alternate Sundays for "old" cases of Poliomyelitis, who although cured of the disease have some residual disability. The cases are collected from a wide area by ambulances and cars and are assisted in changing and also in the water by voluntary helpers. All cases are certified by a doctor to be free from infection. Vaccination against Poliomyelitis The vaccination of children was continued, and the offer of vaccination was extended to include children born in 1955 and 1956, as well as in the age group 1947—1954 as previously. Early in the year, local health authorities were requested by the Minister of Health to vaccinate as many children as possible, and in the light of past experience, he advised that vaccination need not be suspended during the period of the year when Poliomyelitis is prevalent. In Area No. 4, which comprises the Boroughs of Finchley and Hendon, 5,959 children were vaccinated. Separate figures are not available for each district. Measles The number of notifications was 957 compared with 172 in 1956. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough The notifications numbered 119 in 1957 and there were no deaths. During the year, 83 children were immunised by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. Pneumonia Thirty-five cases were notified in 1957 and there were 32 deaths. Twenty-three of these were persons of 65 years of age and over. 19 Puerperal Pyrexia The total number of cases notified during the year was 29, all of which occurred at the North Middlesex Hospital Annexe in The Bishops Avenue. Food Poisoning Two cases of Food Poisoning were notified during the year. Both were single cases, and Salmonella typhi-murium was discovered to be the agent in each case. Influenza At the beginning of October, it appeared from information received from General Practitioners, Schools, chemists and local industries that an outbreak of influenza was developing in the area. The illness was mild, lasting only a few days and the symptoms were usually headache and rise in temperature to 100°F, or more frequently accompanied by muscle pains, sore throat and gastric upsets. The outbreak reached its peak about the middle of the month, and by early November the epidemic had reached its conclusion with only the "odd case" occurring. During the month of October there was a marked increase in the number of Influenzal Pneumonia notifications, 15 cases being notified. There was one death from this cause in a child aged 2½ months, and also two deaths from Influenzal Pneumonia in old people. Miscellaneous The following cases were also notified:— Dysentery 7 Erysipelas 4 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 3 Smallpox Three cases of smallpox were notified in the nearby Borough of Tottenham. As a result, 16 contacts were visited by Public Health Inspectors and were kept under observation for 16 days. All were advised to call upon their family doctors should they, at any time 20 during the period, feel unwell, or should they not have been recently vaccinated. Circular letters were despatched to all General Practitioners in Finchley, giving details of the outbreak. Such information, it was considered, would prove of value in cases in which a diagnosis of smallpox might be suspected. Fortunately, no case occurred in the Borough. Vaccination against Smallpox The number of persons vaccinated for the first time by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority was eight hundred and fifty-six. Five hundred and thirty-eight persons were re-vaccinated. International Certificates of Vaccination Persons travelling to certain foreign parts have to provide themselves with certificates of vaccination or inoculation which must have been completed by their own medical practitioners before proceeding. In several parts of the world certificates are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a medical officer in the Government or local authority of the country of issue. A form of authentication which has been accepted by the health authorities abroad is that given by public health authorities and identified by a rubber stamp impression placed by them on the certificate. The rubber stamp in this office bears the words "Finchley Corporation—Signature of doctor authenticated." The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. During the year some 500 certificates were stamped for this purpose. Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1957:— 21 Throat/Nose Swabs: Positive Negative Diphtheria Bacilli - 277 Hæmolytic Streptococci 28 Vincent's Angina 3 Coagulase Pos. Staphylococci 5 Influenza A Virus 1 Fæces: Sonne Dysentery 8 142 Salmonella 26 Clostridium Welchii — Esch. Coli 2 Sputum: T.B. Smear 2 34 Other Organisms 3 Whooping Cough: Cough Plate - 10 Post-nasal Swab - 78 463 Tuberculosis Seven persons died from tuberculosis during 1957, giving a death rate of 0.101 per 1,000 population. Twenty-nine new cases were notified, and this number is the lowest on record. The case rate per 10,000 population was 4.18. No children of school age were found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs. Close co-operation between the Public Health Department, the Area Health Office and the Chest Clinic in the constant search for possible sources of infection in new cases of tuberculosis continues. 22 23 24 TUBERCULOSIS (ALL FORMS) The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years:— Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M.

Arrangements had been made with the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board for sessions to be held throughout the Borough. The general public were encouraged to attend and sessions were available to them at three points in the district. In all, 1,514 males and 2,064 females were X-rayed. In addition, facilities were given to members and staff of the Council, firms and shops to attend and in this group 1,259 males and 914 females took advantage of the offer. The total number of people X-rayed during the visit of the Unit was 5,751. It is regretted that figures showing abnormal cases found have not been submitted to me in time for inclusion in this report. Medical Examinations Twenty-nine persons were examined on appointment to the Council's staff and 13 workmen were examined with a view to their admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme. 25 National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47 Cases concerning persons who were living in insanitary surroundings and who were not receiving proper care and attention continued to be brought to the notice of the Department. On each occasion it was possible to make satisfactory arrangements for these persons without having to resort to compulsory removal to suitable premises under the provisions of the above Section. (b) Section 50 One burial was carried out by the Council in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Rainfall The following comparative table shows the amount of rainfall recorded at Avenue House grounds during 1956 and 1957:— Rainfall (in inches) 1956. 1957.

The following shows how the applications were dealt with:— Applications Points Awarded in each Case 5 1 3 3 0 2 3 5 Total number of applications — 12. On receipt of these applications, it was often necessary to visit the family concerned and to discuss various aspects of each case with the family doctor and with the Housing Officer. I am indebted to the doctors for their continued co-operation in this matter. In addition, a number of applications were considered on account of overcrowding and sanitary defects. Much work is involved in investigating these cases in order to be certain that deserving cases are given full consideration. In special cases where the medical condition of the applicant merited urgent rehousing but the award of extra "points" would not give immediate help the case was brought before the Housing Lettings Committee of the Council, for their decision, and in every instance the medical reports were taken into account. Health Education Reference is made elsewhere in this Report to educational activities in connection with Food Hygiene. Apart from these, talks dealing with various aspects of the work of the Public Health Department were given by members of the staff to local organisations and Student Teachers and Student Health Visitors. 27 Laundry Service for the Incontinent The problem of dealing with incontinent elderly persons when laundries would not accept soiled articles, and when no relatives or friends were available or willing to help, had been a matter of concern in this district for some time. It had often meant an approach to the Hospital Authorities for admission of the old person to a hospital bed, if one was available. In view of the difficulties involved in these cases, the Council decided to operate a Laundry Service in accordance with the provisions of Section 42 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1956, which deals with, inter alia, the cleansing of soiled articles. A washing machine has been installed at the Disinfecting Station and arrangements are made for the articles to be collected and delivered twice weekly. The practice is for collections to be made on Tuesdays and Fridays, and for deliveries, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The cost of the service is borne by the local authority. The only stipulation made is that the garments or bedding involved must not be the type which could be accepted by a normal commercial laundry. The service was started at the beginning of July, and during the half-year period to the end of December, 42 collections of articles were made. The number of persons for whom the service was recommended and subsequently authorised by the Medical Officer of Health or by the Public Health Inspectors was eleven. Of these, two were receiving assistance at the end of the year. Although the number of persons who availed themselves of the service was small, it does indicate that there is a real need for it in the Borough. As the service becomes more widely known, there is little doubt that the demand will become much greater. 28 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are particulars of the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year 1957:— Housing Statistics 1. Inspection of Dwelling-houses: (1) (a) Total number of dwelling-houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 2,081 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 5,402 (2) (a) Number of dwelling-houses (included under sub-head (1) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 - (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose - (3) Number of dwelling-houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 2 (4) Number of dwelling-houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 304 2. Remedy of defects during the year without service of formal notices: Number of defective dwelling-houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action 211 3. Action under Statutory Powers during the year: A. Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1936, and Sections 9, 10 and 12 of the Housing Act, 1957: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs 4 29 (2) Number of dwelling-houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices: (a) By owners 7 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners 3 B. Proceedings under Public Health Acts: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 15 (2) Number rendered fit: (a) By owners 10 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners - C. Proceedings under Sections 11 and 13 of the Housing Act, 1936, and Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made - (2) Number of dwelling-houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders - Housing Act, 1957 This Act, which came into operation on 1st September, 1957, consolidates the previous housing enactments with the exception of certain provisions relating to financial matters. A definition of the standard of fitness of dwelling-houses is now laid down and is more rigid than in previous acts, as no regard can now be taken to the extent to which, by reason of disrepair or sanitary defects, the house falls short of the provisions of any bye-laws or any enactment in any local Act, in operation in the district, dealing with the construction and drainage of new buildings, the laying out and construction of new streets or of the general standard of housing accommodation for working classes in the district. 30 Slum Clearance The Slum Clearance Programme was resumed during the year and the following areas were dealt with:— (a) 306-324, Friern Barnet Lane, N.20. (10 houses). Vine and Oak Cottages, Totteridge Lane, N.20. (2 houses). These two areas were represented to the Council and confirmed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. (b) 1291 and 1293, High Road, N.20; 1-8, Solomons Terrace, N.20. (10 houses). This area was represented, but confirmation was being awaited at the end of the year, pending the result of a hearing arising from an appeal to the Minister from the occupier of 1291 High Road, N.20. (c) 1-10 (inclusive), Belgrave Terrace, N.12; 4-10 (even), Stanhope Road, N.12. (14 houses). This area was inspected and represented to the Council towards the end of the year and negotiations were proceeding in an endeavour to purchase from the owner. 727 and 729, High Road, N.12 These two houses were found to be in a very dilapidated condition and incapable of being made fit for human habitation at reasonable cost. These were dealt with informally by arrangement with the owner, both premises being vacated. The owner proposes to demolish them at some future date, and to erect business premises upon the site. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 Repairs increase and Certificates of Disrepair. The following table shows the particulars of applications received during the portion of the year in which the Act was in operation:— Number of Applications for Certificates of Disrepair 2 Number of Certificates issued 1 31 Number of Certificates not issued (because work had been done) 1 Number of Applications for Revocation of Certificates of Disrepair 2 Number of Certificates Revoked 2 Rent Act, 1957 This Act came into operation on the 6th July, 1957, and introduced a new and much more involved procedure for obtaining Certificates of Disrepair. Under the new procedure, the tenant must draw up his own list of defects. This is sometimes found to be unsatisfactory, as only the tenant's items can be included in the Certificate of Disrepair, when, often, defects of a more serious nature, which the Public Health Inspector may find during his inspection, cannot be included. Since the Act came into operation, the following are particulars of applications dealt with:— Number of Applications for Certificates of Disrepair 60 Number of Certificates issued 10 Number of Certificates not issued (because work had been done) 5 Number of Certificates refused — Number of Undertakings given by Landlords 15 Number of Applications outstanding at end of year 30 Number of Applications for Cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair — Number of Certificates Cancelled - Number of Applications for Certificates as to the Remedying of Defects which the Landlord had Undertaken to Remedy - Number of Certificates issued - 32 Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 13,657. At 323 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 830 were discovered, and at the end of the year 1,008 including a number outstanding at the end of 1956 had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 48 was in hand and 1,624 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied, 708 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out:— Inspections under Housing Acts 87 Other Inspections including Inspections under Public Health Act, 1936 3,985 Re-inspections 2,613 Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, and Rent Act, 1957 176 Inspections of Works in Progress 708 Inspections of Factories and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 239 Visits to Slaughterhouses 13 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 6 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 10 Inspections of Meat, Fish and Other Food Shops 724 Inspections of Shops (Shops Act) 77 Visits re Infectious Disease and Vermin 298 Visits re Rodent Control 3,599 Visits re Overcrowding 213 Visits re Hawkers 45 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 5 Visits re Pet Animals Act, 1951 13 Visits re Heating Appliances—Fireguards 36 Visits re Clean Air Act, 1956 169 Miscellaneous 641 13,657 33 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Repairs or amendments to existing drains 32 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 208 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 122 Length in yards of iron drains laid 14 Manholes provided 11 Manholes repaired 11 Manhole covers provided 14 Intercepting traps fixed 6 Caps to intercepting traps provided 28 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 2 New gully traps fixed 26 Gully curbs provided or repaired 1 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 11 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 8 Water tests applied 97 Smoke tests applied 39 Air tests applied 9 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C. basins fixed 32 W.Cs. unstopped, cleansed or repaired 22 New flushing cisterns fitted to W.Cs 12 Existing flushing cisterns repaired 6 New W.C. accommodation provided 2 New W.C. apartments provided 3 W.C. apartments altered 3 W.C. apartments cleansed 5 Lavatory basins provided 30 Baths provided 9 New impervious sinks provided 13 New waste pipes fixed 17 Waste pipes trapped, repaired or unstopped 10 Ventilated lobbies provided 2 34 Miscellaneous New roofs provided 1 Roofs repaired 69 Eaves gutters renewed, cleansed or repaired 47 Stack pipes provided, repaired or unstopped 23 Damp walls remedied 58 Walls repointed, repaired or underpinned 24 Ventilation under floors provided or unstopped 6 Paving of yards repaired 8 Floors of rooms relaid 4 Floors of rooms repaired 36 Rooms cleansed, distempered or repapered 115 Plasterwork repaired 108 Windows repaired and/or made to open 59 New windows provided 3 New sashcords provided 66 Window cills provided or repaired 14 Doors provided or repaired 17 Doorsteps provided or repaired 3 Staircases repaired 3 New stoves and ranges provided 4 Stoves and ranges repaired 11 Chimney pots renewed 8 Storage cisterns provided 1 Storage cisterns repaired, cleansed and covered 3 Water service pipes repaired 11 Hot water supplies provided 36 Movable sanitary dustbins provided 6 Nuisances from keeping of animals abated 1 Smoke nuisances abated 2 Accumulations of refuse removed 9 Various 51 Notices Served Informal Notices 325 Statutory Notices 21 35 Enquiries—Outstanding Sanitary Notices One thousand eight hundred and seventeen letters were received during the year from the Town Clerk enquiring whether or not there were any outstanding notices with respect to certain properties in the district. The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. Housing Act, 1949—Section 4 (Power of Local Authorities to make advances for increasing housing accommodation including the converting, altering and enlarging of houses.) Ninety-nine enquiries were dealt with regarding premises which were the subject of applications for advances under Section 4 of the Housing Act, 1949. Disinfection and Disinfestation Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 58 Number of articles disinfected 1,574 Two hundred and ninety-eight visits were made by inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required. The following is a summary of disinfestation work carried out during the year:— Premises Bugs 1 Fleas 1 Lice 1 Cockroaches 6 Ants 2 Wasps 72 Moths 4 Miscellaneous 14 The number of verminous rooms which were dealt with was 10, compared with 14 in 1956. 36 In a number of cases where the Valuation Officer has made a survey arising from an application for a loan under the Housing Act, 1949, premises have been found to be damaged by wood beetles and their larvae (woodworm), and the inspectors have assisted in giving advice and supervising the remedial work. Sanitary Conveniences There are 31 conveniences attached to public houses within the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. There are 14 public conveniences in the Borough, including those in recreation grounds. Thirteen of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and one for males only. Complaints One thousand three hundred and fifty-three complaints were received with reference to the following matters, viz.:— Absence of, or defective condition of, dustbins 12 Accumulations of refuse and manure 28 Blocked or defective drains 249 Defective roofs 40 Defective W.Cs 23 Defective or dirty storage cisterns 3 Flooding 19 Foreign matter in food 6 Insanitary or defective condition of houses 143 Noise 5 Non-removal of refuse 5 Nuisances from dampness 60 Nuisances from the burning of refuse 19 Nuisances from the keeping of animals or poultry 6 Pollution of brook 1 Premises infested with insects 58 Premises infested with rats or mice 514 Smells from public sewers 3 Smoke nuisances 20 Unsatisfactory Housing Conditions, including Overcrowding 21 Unsound food 13 Verminous condition of houses 3 Wasps' nests 58 37 Other complaints 44 The complaints were investigated promptly and in those cases in which the Council had power to intervene the necessary steps were taken to remove the cause of the complaint. Places of Public Entertainment The cinemas, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. The defects discovered as a result of these inspections were remedied after notice had been given to the persons responsible. Twenty-one premises were inspected and a report was submitted to the Middlesex County Council which is the licensing authority. Factories Acts, 1937-1948 1.

It has been found that the home conditions are quite satisfactory. 40 The following table shows, by trades, the number of outworkers residing in the district:— Wearing apparel 35 Artificial flowers 1 Lampshades 10 Handbags 1 41 FOOD FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955 Food Hygiene Regulations The food hygiene regulations lay down requirements in respect of the cleanliness of food premises and stalls, and of apparatus and equipment, the hygienic handling of food, the cleanliness of persons engaged in the handling of food and of their clothing, and the action to be taken where they suffer from or are carriers of certain infections; the construction of food premises, their repair and maintenance and the facilities including sinks and wash basins to be provided ; and the temperature at which certain foods are to be kept. In one instance a road-side cafe which could not be brought up to the standard of the Regulations was closed and demolished. The occupiers of two food premises, namely, a butcher's shop and a grocer's shop, failed to provide sufficient sinks or other facilities for washing food and equipment used in the food business. Particulars of these offences will be found under the heading, " Legal Proceedings." 1. Number of Inspections: The Public Health Inspectors continued a survey of food premises which was commenced in the previous year and, by the end of the year, 738 visits had been made to shops and other premises in order to ascertain compliance with the Regulations, and arising therefrom 216 contraventions were found, and 43 letters sent and 21 verbal notices given in connection therewith.

School Kitchens: All school kitchens in Finchley were visited by the Public Health Inspectors and the Staffs are to be commended on the high standard of cleanliness attained. 6. Educational Activities: During the early part of the year, the Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector addressed some fifty members of the Finchley Rotary Club. 7. Method of Disposal of Condemned Food: Condemned food is removed by the Public Health Department's van and is destroyed at the Council's Refuse Destructor. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared continued to receive special attention. Four new registrations of hawkers were granted during the year. Before registration is granted the Council insist upon satisfactory storage accommodation being provided and this is checked where necessary with the Local Authority concerned. The number of barrow boys operating in the district at the end of the year was 4. Slaughterhouses At the beginning of the year, there was only one slaughterhouse in the district which has been regularly inspected. 45 Carcases and Offal Inspected and Condemned in Whole or in Part Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses Number killed (if known) 60 — 4 84 204 — Number inspected 60 — 4 84 204 — All Diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci: Whole carcases condemned - - - - 2 - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 2 - - - 8 - Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci 3.33 - - - 4.90 - Tuberculosis only: Whole carcases condemned - - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 1 - - - - - Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis 1.66 Cysticercosis: Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - - - Carcases submitted to treatment by refrigeration - - - - - - Generalised and totally condemned - - - - - - 46 UNSOUND FOOD CONDEMNED, 1957 (1) In Slaughterhouses TUBERCULOSIS Cattle Mesenteries 1 OTHER DISEASES Cattle Livers 1 (Flukes).

The condition arose through the introduction of harmful bacteria in the processing plant, and the assistance of the Department was sought to rectify the trouble. Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933, and the Slaughter of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1954, all animals, including sheep, slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Acts also provide that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. Two persons were licensed during 1957. Butchers' Shops Two new butchers' shops were opened during 1957, making the total at the end of the year, 49. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. 51 All these premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough is 22. At 21 bakehouses motive power in used. The bakehouses have been visited by the inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops There are 8 registered premises within the district, and all have been inspected from time to time. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1957, as follows:— Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 20 Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 22 Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Sterilised 30 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 9 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 9 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Sterilised 9 Food Sampling The following information has been furnished by the Middlesex County Council Public Control Department relative to samples taken in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955:— 52 List of Samples procured in the Borough during the year Article Total Samples procured. Unsatisfactory. Milk (new) 305 22 Milk (various) 43 — Butter 18 — Cakes 12 — Cooked Meat 8 — Cheese 17 1 Cream 11 — Drugs 11 — Fish—fresh, canned, etc. 11 1 Fruit—fresh and canned 3 — Fruit squash 10 8 Ice cream 5 — Meat 12 — Sausages, etc. 2 — Spirits 2 — Vinegar 15 — Miscellaneous 20 2 Totals 505 34 Regarding the samples noted as unsatisfactory, the following comments are added:— Milk (New). It will be seen that a considerable number of samples of new milk were taken during the year in question. These were all from churns of milk delivered by dairy farmers to milk processing depots in the area. The total of 22 samples which are shown as unsatisfactory were taken from 8 different dairy farmers and were slightly below the presumptive standard for composition, some having a slight deficiency of milk fat, some of milk solids not fat, and some deficient in both respects. With regard to the unsatisfactory samples from 7 of these farmers they were confined to just a few churns among many, the remaining churns of milk forming the whole consignment being satisfactory. In the case of the eighth 53 farmer, all the 7 churns of milk which he consigned at one time were found to be slightly deficient; a letter was sent to the farmer concerned drawing his attention to the results of analysis and full information was also given to the Milk Marketing Board in order that the farmer might have the benefit of that Board's Advisory Service. Cheese. A sample of Camembert cheese purchased from a retailer was found to be contaminated with live maggots of the house fly. A full investigation was made but no fault or omission could be found which would have led directly to the contamination. An official caution was addressed to the retailer concerned. Fish—Fresh and Canned, etc. A sample of salmon and potato salad was obtained and the label on the tin of this food bore a pictorial representation which was misleading as to the true nature of the contents in the tin. A letter of caution was sent to the retail company concerned. Fruit Squash. 8 samples of fruit squashes were purchased from a retailer, all the product of one manufacturer. Some were found to be deficient in fruit juice and/or added sugar, and some were contaminated with mould hyphæ and spores. Proceedings were instituted against the manufacturer concerned in respect of the four samples which were most seriously at fault and he was fined a total of £8 8s. 0d. Miscellaneous. A sample of Swiss Milk Bars was found to be labelled by the manufacturers with a misleading description of the food. This sample was taken as part of the enquiries into an earlier sample of the same product. The enquiries began at the end of 1956 and were completed early in 1957. A retailer's assistant received an official caution for selling Guernsey tomatoes when English tomatoes were requested. The Public Control Department also reported upon the following matters:— Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953. 143 inspections of shops were undertaken to ensure that the Marking Orders relating to certain imported foodstuffs made under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926, 54 were complied with. 552 separate displays of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry and dried fruit were examined, and in addition a number of test purchases were made. 19 summonses were issued against a firm of butchers for exposing for sale imported meat and offal not marked with a prescribed indication of origin. The company was fined a total of £19 and ordered to pay £5 5s. 0d. costs. Another firm of butchers received an official caution for selling frozen beef under the false trade description "chilled," and a fruiterer was cautioned for failing to mark with an indication of origin imported tomatoes exposed for sale. During the year test purchases were made of quantities of paraffin and 4 offences for giving a false trade description of measure in connection with such sales were detected. One trader, who made two such sales, was prosecuted and fined, the fines and costs amounting to £3 2s. 0d. A second trader who committed two offences of a similar nature received an official caution. Labelling of Food Order, 1953. At 184 premises 890 articles of pre-packed food were examined to see that they bore a label which gave a clear statement of the designation of the food and, in the case of compound foods, the ingredients, and also the name and address of the packer or labeller. No infringement of this Order was detected. False or Misleading Descriptions. As in previous years a considerable amount of work has been done in the detailed scrutiny of advertisements and the labels on pre-packed foods, and taking suitable action in those cases where a label or advertisement contains a false or misleading description of the food to which it relates. This work is of benefit to the whole County irrespective of where within the County offences may be detected. During the year under review corrective action has been secured in respect of salmon with potato salad, crystallized jelly, pineapple slices, pure egg mundelect, cherry juice, lime juice, imitation cream, cream filled biscuits, cream filled Easter eggs and cheese. In every case the person responsible agreed to make necessary suitable amendments to labels as a result of representations. In no case was it necessary to institute proceedings. Special Designated Milk. During the year in question three licences were issued in respect of the use of a special designation for 55 milk processed within the area; two dealer/pasteurisers were licensed in respect of the use of the designation "pasteurised" and one dealer/ steriliser in respect of the designation "sterilised." 54 samples of designated milk were taken, all of which were certified as being satisfactory. Safe Milk. In addition to the foregoing, 51 samples of raw milk were procured within the Borough and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli. None was found contaminated. Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only one person makes ice cream within the Borough, and employs the method known as "complete cold mix" which only requires the addition of water. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 149 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Coffee Stalls Early in the year, the one remaining coffee stall in the district was closed. Fish Friers At the end of 1957, there were seven premises in the district where the business of fish frying was carried out, one having been closed during the year. Game Licences Fifteen applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. Shops Act, 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. Particulars in regard to shops on the Register are as follows:— 56 Number on Register at beginning of 1957 946 Number closed 9 New Shops 20 Number on Register at end of 1957 957 Changes of Occupancy 12 The number of persons observing the Jewish Sabbath and registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Act was eleven. Swimming Pools In co-operation with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, samples of the water at the Adult and Children's Open Air Pools were taken during the summer months and all were satisfactory. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and in quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company and copies of report* on 12 samples which were taken by the Company during the year and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Counties Public Health Laboratory were forwarded to me. In all cases the results were satisfactory. In addition, a complaint was received from the occupier of a house regarding the quality of the water supply, and in co-operation with the Chief Chemist and Bacteriologist of the Barnet District Water Company, four samples were taken and found to be satisfactory. All dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses with the exception of 4 serving a population of 9 which are served by a standpipe. These houses are in a Clearance Area which had been represented to the Council and are being dealt with. Pollution of Streams and Watercourses Further investigations have been carried out regarding the pollution of streams in and adjoinng the district and in connection 57 therewith, a number of soil fittings were found to be connected to the surface water sewers and appropriate action was taken for these to be made to discharge into the soil sewers. Clean Air Act, 1956 The above Act deals with the control of dark smoke, smoke from furnaces, smoke control areas and special cases of smoke emission, which include special processes to be dealt with under the Alkali Act, colliery spoil-banks, railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. It also make provision for the establishment of a Clean Air Council for England and Wales. Certain sections of the Act came into operation on the 31st December, 1956, including those relating to the height of chimneys and smoke control areas. With regard to the latter, any local authority may make an order, which must be confirmed by the Minister, declaring the whole or any part of its district as a smoke control area. Subject to any stated exceptions and limitations, the emission of chimney smoke in such an area, on any day, is an offence unless the emission was caused only by the burning of an authorised fuel. If the owner or occupier of a private dwelling which is in, or will be in, a smoke control area, has to incur expenditure in adapting his heating arrangements, the local authority shall repay him seventenths of the cost. A survey was made of approximately 10% of the 1,400 premises in the southern portion of the Hampstead Garden Suburb, the area being about 435 acres in extent. Particulars with regard to this proposed area and the estimated costs were submitted to the Public Health Committee, but the Council decided to take no action for the time being. Smoke Abatement The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally little nuisance from smoke or grit has occurred. Twenty complaints were received during the year, a number of them relating to burning of garden and other refuse. 58 A considerable number of installations, both industrial and domestic, are being converted or installed for oil burning. Many enquiries are received by the Petroleum Inspector from persons desirous of installing oil fired plant and for the safe storage of the oil and whilst advice is freely given it is sometimes refused in the absence of the necessary legislation to control this matter. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There are two traders whose premises come within the definition of the Act and are registered. Pet Animals Act, 1951 The number of persons licensed at the end of the year was 7. All the premises have been inspected. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 Thirty-six visits have been made to premises to ascertain that the provisions of the Act were being complied with. In one shop, an electric fire was found which did not comply with the regulations made under the Act. Legal proceedings were instituted, particulars of which will be seen under the heading, "Legal Proceedings." Burial Act, 1857 Licences for the removal of human remains under the above Act state, inter alia, "It is considered advisable that the Medical Officer of Health should be notified whenever such a licence is granted in order that he may be in a position to take (under his general powers) any action that may appear to him to be necessary in the interests of public health." Ten copies of licences for such removals were received from the Home Office during the year. The exhumations were carried out in the early hours of the morning and were visited when necessary by one of the public health inspectors, in order to ascertain that the conditions of the licences were complied with. 59 Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following instances:— A butcher was summonsed for various offences under the Food Hygiene Regulations, as follows:— (a) For failure to provide and maintain suitable and sufficient sinks or other facilities for washing food and equipment, a fine of £5 on each of 3 summonses was imposed. (b) Three further summonses for failure to provide an adequate supply of either hot and cold water, or of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature. These summonses were dismissed. (c) There were two further summonses for failing to keep clean all sinks and other facilities; one was dismissed and there was a fine of £5 in connection with the other. The proprietor of a provision store was also summonsed for failure to provide and maintain a suitable sink, hot water supply, etc., but on the day of the hearing, the work in connection with these items had been commenced and an undertaking given by the defendant's solicitor that the owner would carry out all the work required by the Council, and it was agreed that the summons be withdrawn. An owner of some flats was summonsed under the Public Health Act for failure to comply with Statutory Notices with regard to the carrying out of certain repairs. On the 3 summonses, he was fined a total of £9 with 6 guineas' costs and was ordered to carry out the necessary works under the threat of a daily penalty, in default. For failing to notify the Local Authority of his intention to convert a building into flats, submitting plans, and for failing to notify alterations and additions to drains, and contraventions of the building byelaws, an owner was fined a total of £40 and 19 guineas' costs. The proprietor of a shop was summonsed for offering for sale an electric fire with a guard not of the standard prescribed by the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Regulations. The defendant was fined £10 with 10 guineas' costs. 60 RODENT CONTROL Complaints and Infestations Premises from which complaints have been received Premises where infestation was confirmed Premises where infestation was not confirmed 1957/8 1956/7 1957/8 1956/7 1957/8 1956/7 Rats 380 313 218 224 162 89 Mice 134 132 106 127 28 5 Total 514 445 324 351 190 94 It is difficult to know the reason for the increased number of complaints of both rats and mice which were not confirmed. Taking these figures into consideration it does appear that the increased number of complaints received is satisfactory. Arising from Surveys, block treatment and complaints, 28 additional premises were found to be infested with rats or mice, three being at business premises and the remaining 25 being at dwelling houses. Thirty-four smoke tests were applied to rat runs which revealed defects in drains and/or sewers in 15 cases. Three of these cases had not been remedied on the 31st March, 1958, but the work was in hand. One of the defects found and which caused a considerable amount of work in the surrounding area was caused by the Electricity Board employees breaking a drain while laying a new supply cable into the premises. The premises concerned are occupied by a Baker. The number of people keeping poultry is now very much reduced in the district, and at 15 premises where poultry is kept, rats were discovered, representing 4.62% of the total complaints. 61 Summary of Work carried out from 1/4/1957 to 31/3/1958 Rats Mice Visits in connection with infestations and surveys 2,761 838 Number of confirmed infestations 218 106 Prebaits 378 — Zinc Phosphide POISONS 98 — Arsenic — — Red Squill 5 — A.N.T.U. 19 — Warfarin 2,351 359 Gassings 2 - Treatment of Sewers It was impossible owing to labour shortage to carry out a maintenance treatment in May. In October, however, two areas were treated, when 668 manholes were tested. Only 8 poison takes were recorded which was 1.19% of all manholes treated. 62 INDEX Page Bacteriological Work 21 Bakehouses 52 Births and Birth Rate 7, 8, 9, 17 Burial Act, 1857 59 Burial of the Dead 26 Butchers' Shops 52 Carcases Inspected and Condemned 46 Certificates of Disrepair 31 Clean Air Act, 1956 58 Coffee Stalls 56 Committee Members 2, 3 Complaints 37 Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops 52 Deaths and Death Rate 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 Diphtheria 18 Diphtheria Immunisation 18 Disinfection 36 Disinfestation 36 Dysentery 20 Enquiries—Outstanding Sanitary Notices 36 Erysipelas 20 Factories 38 Fish Friers 56 Food Hygiene 42 Food Poisoning 20 Food Sampling 52 Game Licences 56 Health Education 27 Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 59 Housing 27 Housing Act, 1949 36 Housing Act, 1957 30 Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 31 Housing Statistics 29 Ice Cream Premises 56 Infantile Mortality 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 17 Infectious Diseases 18 Influenza 20 Inspections by Public Health Inspectors 33 International Certificates of Vaccination 21 Laundry Service for the Incontinent 28 Legal Proceedings 60 Mass Radiography 25 Maternal Mortality 7, 8 Measles 19 Page Meat and Food Inspections 45, 46 Medical Examinations 25 Members of Committees 2, 3 Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 52 Mortuary 11 National Assistance Act, 1948 26 Neo-Natal Mortality 7, 13 Notices Served 35 Octopus Club 19 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 20 Outworkers 40 Persons in Need of Care and Attention 26 Pet Animals Act, 1951 59 Places of Public Entertainment 38 Pneumonia 19 Poliomyelitis 18 Pollution of Streams and Watercourses 57 Population 7, 8 Puerperal Pyrexia 20 Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 59 Rainfall 26 Rent Act, 1957 32 Rodent Control 61 Sanitary Circumstances of the Area 29 Sanitary Conveniences 37 Sanitary Improvements carried out 34 Scarlet Fever 18 Shops Act, 1950 56 Slaughter of Animals 51 Slaughterhouses 45 Slaughtermen 51 Slum Clearance 31 Smallpox 20 Smoke Control 58 Squires Lane Bath, use of 19 Staff 3, 4 Statistics 7, 17 Stillbirths 7, 8 Swimming Pools-Water Sampling 57 Tuberculosis 22, 23 Unsound Food 47 Vaccination against Poliomyelitis 19 Vaccination against Smallpox 21 Vital Statistics 17 Water Supply 57 Whooping Cough 19 Hendon Printing Works Ltd. 42/44, Victoria Road, N.W.4 Phone: SUN. 1004
