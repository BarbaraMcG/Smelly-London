There have been no outstanding epidemics and the death rate from all causes remains within normal limits. In this connection it is worth recording that there have been no deaths from puerperal causes in the year 1940. Since the foundng of the Diphtheria Immunisation Clinics in 1940.319 children have been immunised 58 of whom wore under five years of age. I should like to draw the attention of all residents in the area to the facilities for this immunisation and wouldrurge everybody to have their children done at the earliest possible moment. Child Welfare Clinic. In spite of the occupation of the Cardinal Road, Clinic by the A.R.P. services every endeavour has "been made to maintain the Maternity .and Child welfare Clinics as normal as possible.
