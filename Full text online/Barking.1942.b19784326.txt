I much regret to report the sudden death of Mr. Foy your Senior Dental Surgeon, on the 2nd November, 1942, after thirteen years service in the Borough. Daring the year members of the staff have continued to participate in the Civil Defence Scheme, but for the most part they have been engaged upon their normal duties in connection with the Public Health and Medical Services. Mrs. Bronnick and Mrs. Bishop, Municipal Midlives, continued to serve at the Battlers Green Snergency Maternity Home, Radlett, throughout "the year 1942. 4 SECTION A. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. 1. BIRTHS. There were 1,205 live births during the year and the figure for 1941 was 1,017. The still births numbered twenty-nine, those for the previous year being thirty. 2. DEATHS. (a) General. The deaths registered in Barking in the year 1942 numbered 263. Seven of these were deaths of non-residents and the number of Barking residents who died elsewhere was 310. The net deaths, therefore, were 566 (including residents who died elsewhere and excluding the deaths of visitors):- Males. Females. Total. 314 252 566 The principal causes of death are set out here under:- (net deaths). Causes of Death. Total. Cerebro Spinal Fever 3 Scarlet Fever 1 Whooping Cough 1 Pulmonary Tuberculosis 37 Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis 7 Syphilitic diseases. 9 Influenza 3 Acute Inf. Encephalitis 2 Canoer (all forms) 104 Diabetes 3 Intra-cranial Vascular lesions 37 Heart Disease 115 Other diseases of circulatory system 28 Bronchitis 25 Pneumonia 35 Other respiratory diseases 4 Ulcer of stomach or duodenum 9 Diarrhoea (under 2 years) 1 Appendicitis 4 Other digestive diseases 15 Nephritis 14 Otherer maternal causes 2 Premature Birth 12 Congenital Malformations, birth injury, infantile diseases 20 Suicide 3 Road traffic accidents 8 Other violent causes 17 A11 other causes 47 Totals. 566 5 (b) Infant Mortality. There were 43 deaths of children under one year, and this compares with thirty-four for the previous year. The actual causes of death of these forty-three children are set out in the following table:- 0-1 mth 1-3 mths 3-6 mths 6-9 mths 9-12 mths Total under 1 year. Acuta meningococcal septicaemia 1 1 Acute bronchitis 1 1 Acute suppurative broncho pneumonia 1 1 Acute gastritis 1 1 Acute circulatory failure, Acute cerebral congestion, Toxaemia 1 1 Anencephaly 1 1 Anencephaly with meningocele 1 1 Asphyxia, natural due to acute suppurative bronchitis 1 1 Atelectasis 2 2 Atelectasis, Prematurity 1 1 Bilateral pneumonia 1 1 Broncho pneumonia 1 1 Brondho pneumonia, Hydrocephalus, Mongoloid type. 1 1 Cardiac failure, persistent vomiting lyloric spasm 1 1 Cardiac failure, Cachexia) persistent vomiting 1 1 Cardiac failure due to Acute Streptococcal pneumonia 1 1 Cardiac failure, Pulmonary Atelectasis 1 1 Cardiac failure, Atelectasis & Prematurity 1 1 Cardiac failure due to Toxaemia due to broncho pneumonia 1 1 Cardio respiratory failure, prematurity. 2 2 Congenital Syphilis 1 1 Heart failure, cerebral haemorrhage 1 1 Imperforate Anus 1 1 Infective atelectasis pulmonum 1 1 Marasmus, congenital pyloric stenosis 1 1 Meningocele 1 1 Meningomyelocele, hydrocephalus 1 1 Peritonitis, perforated duodenal ulcer 1 1 Prematurity 7 7 Respiratory failure, prematurity 1 1 Septic broncho pneumonia, Inanitation congenital oesophageal atresia 1 1 Spina bifida 3 3 Suppurative hepatitis, Sepsis of the cord. 1 1 Totals. 30 7 3 2 1 43 The Registrar General and my own Department are agreed on the figure of 43. Of these forty-three deaths, there were ten which in ny opinion do not come within any known medicine and, therefore, at this stage of knowledge are inevitable. Of these ten, nine died within the first month, so that of the thirty that died within the first month there are still twenty-one which may be looked upon as preventable, which shows that although our figures are very good indeed there is still room for improvement. Of the wellnigh 1,200 children that were alive at the end of one month, thirteen only died. One of these, as I have said above, was inevitable; of the remaining twelve cases, seven were due to infection of the lungs and one, although not being an infeotion of the lungs, was an infection of a similar nature. Infant Mortality for the past five years has been less than forty per thousand. (c) Maternal Mortality. The number of Barking women who died owing to, or in consequence of pregnancy or childbirth was two, and we had the same number of deaths on this account during the previous year. The Registrar General gives this number and it agrees with the figure prepared locally. In these two cases one died owing to, or in consequence of pregnancy so that of your 1,200 births one only mother died in consequence of childbirth. SOCIAL CONDITIONS. (a) General. The considerable improvement in the interest shown by the public in the years 1940 and 1941, in obtaining advice and treatment under your public health and medical services, has been maintained, and an even greater interest than pre-war is now being taken in the various schemes you have established to provide for the health and well-being of the population. I have previously pointed out that the infant mortality rate of a town is one indication as to social conditions, and in this connection it should be noted that the infant mortality rate is lower than for the previous year. (b) Scales of Assessment. Although only minor changes have taken place during the year 1942, there is a considerable amount of work entailed in assessing maternity charges for women who are confined outside the area of their normal residence. There should be some simplification, if indeed the time has not come for the abolition of these charges, particularly where they cannot be collected at an economic figure. (c) Unemployment. The Ministry of Labour and National Service inform me that during the year 1942 unemployment in this area has been the lowest on record in both the Men and Women's Sections. That there has been unemployment is largely due to the fact that there must in every community, be some persons who because of physical disability or other reasons, are not able to work at all, or only able to work in specially selected appointments, and then perhaps only for short periods at intervals. The establishment of day nurseries in the area to look after the children during the time the mothers are at work has been very helpful. 7 ~:r -rro:.«<vowe:,. ■ »\r{ o r- . * r[ (jd>■ ■: - . ::: :v SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. 1. GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. (a) Ambulance Facilities. Your three Borough Ambulances remain stationed at a Civil Defence Depot and continue to be operated by Civil Defence personnel. Reciprocal arrangements with the adjoining areas have been maintained. (b) Hospital Facilities. The Barking Hospital continued to be an Emergency Hospital in the Emergency Medical Service Schone. By arrangement beds are available for patients from your own public health services, the numbers limited, however, by the nursing staff available. Voluntary hospitals catering for the residents of the Borough were again given financial assistance, and the sum of £300 was allocated ty you for distribution to these hospitals. ( c) Clinics and Treatment Centres. The Central Clinic, Vioarage Drive, was, of course, used extensively daring the year, and the Greig Hall and Porters Avenue premises continued in service as Clinics and out-patient departments. The attendances at the out-patient departments were very high during 1942 - totalling 118,000, compared with 90,000 in the year 1939. Humphrey Ante-Natal Clinic at Upney Hospital transferred to Upney First Aid Post on 16.3.42, and the Post-Natal Clinic frcm Central Clinic to Upney First Aid Post on 21.4.42. (d) Foot Clinic. This clinic's popularity continued to increase in 1942. The work was restricted by the availability of the part-time staff and although a whole-time chiropodist was appointed in June and part-time operators were still employed at the end of the year, new patients could not be accommodated immediately. The following statistics indicate the increased use of the facilities available:- 1941 1942 Treatment Sessions. 535 903 New patients. 627 964 Treatments given. 3,358 5,475 Of the new patients in 1942, 256 were old-age pensioners and 230 school children. Whilst in 1940 and 1941 the clinic was mostly attended by elderly people and housewives, 1942 attenders included a number of young wemen and working men. The evening sessions have been of considerable value to these younger persons. 8 (e) Skin Clinic. In Deceber, 1942, a Skin Clinic was commenced in the Paget Ward, Barking Hospital, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with a Medical Officer in attendance, to which all cases of scabies and other diseases which did not respond readily to treatment were referred. You have now appointed a Specialist Consultant and Dr. Arthur Burrows held his first session early in 1943. (f) Scabies. In March, 1942, arrangements were made for such cases to receive baths at the Paget Ward, Barking Hospital, and this clinic was operated by Civil Defence personnel seconded from the First Aid Posts. Medical practitioners rendered cordial co-operation with the result that towards the end of the year, in addition to children, patients were being referred automatically for treatment both from industrial premises and through, general practitioners. The following is a statement of cases reported and treated during the year:- New cases. Recurring cases. Total. Total number of patients. 852 67 919 Adults. 177 2 179 Children. 675 65 740 Referred from:- Clinics. 695 62 757 Other sources. 161 1 162 Number of cases cleansed: - Adults. 92 1 93 Children. 187 33 220 Of the remaining 606 who were not cleansed at the Barking Hospital, 580 were treated at the clinics, and 26 were otherwise dealt with. (g) Nursing in the Home. The Council render considerable help to the two District Nursing Associations responsible for Nursing in the Home - viz, , the Plaistow Maternity Hospital and District Nurses' Home and the East Barking District Nursing Association. The District work has grown in recent years, and is carried out satisfactorily by the Organisations mentioned. (h) Post-War Re-development. In 1942, a special Committee of the Council was set up to consider Post-War Re-development and each Committee was invited to submit schemes to that Committee. At the end of the year the question of Post-war plans in connection with housing and medical services was under consideration. 9 2. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. (a) Ante-Natal and Post-Natal Supervision. In spite of the evacuation of many expectant mothers, the number of attendances of ante-natal cases at your clinics amounted to 10,219, an increase of over 1,900 on the figure for the previous year. The number of post-natal attendances (694) showed an increase of nearly 200 and gynaecological attendances (743) an increase of nearly 400 over the previous year. Notwithstanding the fact that patients requiring examination as post-natal or gynaecological cases can be seen at all the clinics, we are able to offer special facilities at the Upney Post-Natal Clinic and we are very glad to be able to say that a very large majority of these people avail themselves of these facilities and do attend at the Upney Clinic. Not only is this satisfactory from the present standpoint, but it shows that the site of the Hospital is a suitable one for a Central Clinic after the War. (b) Midwifery. (i) Supervision. There were eleven midwives practising in the Borough at the end of the year, six of which were employed at the Upney Maternity Pavilion. During the year 1942, midlives sought medical assistance in 108 cases; 23 of -these were on behalf of babies. (ii) Midlives Act, 1936. 418 mothers were delivered in Barking under your district midwifery scheme daring the year 1942. In addition 44 mothers were delivered by doctors with district midwives in attendance. (c) Upney Maternity Pavilion (and Barking Emergency Hospital). At the Upney Maternity Pavilion- during. 1942, patients were ccnfined, 29 patients were admitted for ante-natal treatment, 4 for post-natal treatment and there were 3 miscarriages. At the Barking Emergency Hospital 254 expectant mothers spent a total of 1,763 bed days. In addition, the Barking Hospital has been used in other ways; there were 46 gynaecological, 1 abortion, and 66 post-confinement cases, a total of 113 who spent 1,656 bed days. In addition to the above, arrangements were made for a midwife fran the Upney Maternity Hospital to attend at the Ilford Isolation Hospital to deliver a Barking weman who was a patient in that hospital. (d) Evacuation. Evacuation of expectant mothers in the last month of pregnancy proceeded in 1942 as in 1941. 183 were sent to Radlott, and, owing to the limited accommodation there, 27 were sent to other places in Hertfordshire and 22 to other reception areas in England. (e) Infant Welfare Centres. The total number of attendances at the Infant Welfare centres during 1942 was 31,179, canpared with 27,028 in 1941. (f) Heme Visiting. The total number of visits paid during 1942 was 17,950, a decrease when compared with the figure of 18,514 for the year 1941. The public services you are undertaking and which involve the time of Health Visitors, account for this decrease in the number of home visits, particularly, of course, the campaign for immunisation against diphtheria which was carried out actively during the last two months of the year. I still look upon home visiting as the back-bone of your Child Welfare Services and I know that you have this matter not only under consideration but, at the time of writing this report, in hand. 10 (g) Circumcision Clinic. This clinic was carried on regularly during the year 1942, and 88 case received treatment. (h) Birth Control. During the year 1942, eleven cases attended the Birth Control Clinic, none of whom had attended in previous years. One of these attended on three occasions, eight on two occasions and two on one occasion. (i) Supplementary Clothing Coupons for Expectant Mothers- On the 1st June 1942, the allowance of clothing coupons for expectant mothers was increased from 50 to 60 coupons. During the year 1942, issues wore made to 1,304 patients, 14 of which were in respect of twin pregnancies. (j) Issue of Vitamins to Children under 5 years* During the year ccrtain changes took place in the Government Scheme for the issue of cod. liver oil and fruit juices. In July, fruit juioes, which had been available only to children up to two years of age, were made available for all children up to three years and towards the end of the year a further extension was granted to include all children up to five years of age. During the course of the year, also, blackcurrant syrup and blackcurrant puree were withdrawn from issue, being replaced by concentrated orange juice. At the end of the year a little over 50% of the children eligible were taking advantage of the soheme for the issue of orange juice, but only about 30% were receiving cod liver oil. Of the children receivlng these vitamins, approximately 47% obtained thoir supplies through your Infant Welfare Clinics and the remaining 53% from the Pood Office. A further extension to the Government Scheme was that in November, 1942, cod liver oil and orange juice were made available, also, to expectant mothers. (k) Wartime Nurseries. During the year two Wartime Nurseries were opened - one at Eastbuiy House on the 9th March 1942, and the other at Lodge Farm House on the 8th September, 1942. These Nurseries provide accommodation for 80 and 38 children respectively and the average daily attendances (excluding Saturdays) at the end of the year were 41 for Eastbury and 25 for Lodge Farm. In September the ordinary difficulties of staffing the Nurseries were increased by the illness of the Matron, Miss D. Crockford. As you know, this illness terminated in the death of Miss Crockford on 30.10.42, and this news was received with regret by all who had known her. In October 1942, you considered the question of extending the Nursery provision and negotiations were oommenoed regarding the setting up of a third Nursery in the Goresbrook Road area. These negotiations were still proceeding at the end of the year. 3. 0RPH3PAEDIC SERVICES. On the whole the work in all branches in this department has increased during the last year. (1942). In March, 1942, the Orthopaedic Scheme was extended so that members of the general public could also consult the Orthopaedic Surgeon. Much work has been done by your masseuses during the year on massage, exercises, electrical treatment, etc. 11 PARTICULARS OF THE WORK DONE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORTHOPAEDIC CLINIC DURING 1942.

Squint training was resumed during 1941 and continued during the year 1942, the number of sessions held being 110. This Service is of high value, and the numbers attending for treatment have increased. 6. DENTAL INSPECTION AND TREATMENT. The work of your Dental Services was considerably handicapped by changes in staff. In addition to Mr. Foy's passing, one of your Assistant Dental Surgeons was called to His Majesty's Forces - other appointments were made and you now have under consideration the appointment of a fourth Dental Officer. Dental inspection and treatment of children of school age is dealt with in my Annual Report as School Medical Officer. Your Dental Centres are now the Bifrons Clinic, the Manor Clinic and the Central Clinic, this latter having been re-established in October, 1942. Statistics for the year ended 31st December, 1942, in relation to your Public Adult and Maternity and Child Welfare Dental Schemes, are given below:- Public Adult Dental Scheme. Number of visits of patients to Clinics. 3,730 Number of Dentures supplied. 597 Maternity and Child Welfare Dental Scheme. Number of attendances of Mothers and Children under five years. 2, 309 14 SECTION c. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. 1. RAINFALL. The rainfall for "the year ended 31st December, 1942, was 21.64 inches, as compared with 21.7 for the previous year. Rain fell on 138 days in the year 1942. 2. WATER SUPPLY. The total extension of mains in the Borough for the year 1942 was eighteen yards. Samples are drawn from the domestic supplies and submitted every quarter for chemical examination, and monthly for "bacteriological examination. All samples were reported pure and wholesome and suitable for drinking and domestic purposes. 3. DRAINAGE AND SEVERAGE. Drainage arrangements continue as heretofore. 4. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The rivers and streams running through the area are tidal in character and are not controlled by the Corporation. Attention is directed to the continued unsatisfactory condition obtaining in the River Roding. The drought period of the last few years has emphasised the fact that during the summer months the whole of the water in the Roding above tidal limits consists of sewage works effluents. We lock forward to the time when a trunk sewerage system for West Essex will avoid the discharge of effluents into the Roding, and the return to what should be normal conditions, namely that of a pleasant stream. 5. CLOSET ACCOMMODATION. At the end of the year there remained a total of 15 premises unconnected with the sewer, 10 of which were factory premises# 6. PUBLIC CLEANSING. During the year 3. 357 loads of refuse were collected with an average weight of 2.03 tons per load. 7. REFUSE DISPOSAL. The refuse of the Borough, by arrangement with the County Borough of East Ham, was taken to the destructor works of that Authority. 15 8. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. Snergency and War conditions have interfered seriously with the routine work of the Department. (a) WORK OF SANITARY INSPECTORS. (i) Inspection of Dwelling Houses.

The following is a list of the above type of premises:- (1) Houses let in lodgings. (2) Common Lodging Houses. 13) Tents, Vans and Sheds. (4) Underground sleeping rooms. (5) Offensive Trades. (6) Piggeries. (7) Stables. (d) RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION ACT, 1919. There were 210 visits made to premises under this Act, and any necessary work arising has "been carried out. It has "been noted that the increase in the infestation rate is due to domestic keeping of poultry and rabbits, with subsequent nesting in the material used as covering for Anderson shelters. The new problem has been met by employing where necessary, workmen to open up the burrows. 9. ERADICATION OF BED BU&S. The following houses have been disinfested:- Barking Council Houses 7 Privately owned Houses 31 London County Council Houses 6 17 SECTION D. HOUSING. 1. STATISTICS. (a) General.

INSPECTION AMD SUPERVISION OF FOOD. MILK SUPPLY. There are no cowkeepers in the district and we have only one daily where milk is handled or treated. The remaining 57 premises on the register retail pre-packed supplies. In addition there are ten milk purveyors who occupy premises in other districts, hut retail in Barking. The following table sets out the results of the bacteriological examination of various samples. Type of sample. Satisfactory. Unsatisfactory. Totals. "Sterilised" Milk. 2 - 2 "Pasteurised" Milk. 39 1 40 Raw Milk. 1 - 1 "Homogenised" Milk. 1 - 1 Tuberculin Tested Milk. 1 2 3 Totals. 44 3 47 There were, daring the year, 41 samples of milk submitted to biological examination for the presence of tubercle. In four cases the guinea pig died prematurely. In one case the result was positive. I am glad to record that, apart from the Tuberculin Tested Milk retailed under that designation, the whole of the supplies in Barking have been treated satisfactorily either by Pasteuri sation or Sterilisation. The following table shows the number of licenoes granted during the year for the sale of graded milks under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1936:- Tuberculin Tested 7 Pasteurised 11 MEAT AND OTHER FOODS. (a) Meat. Since the outbreak of war slaughtering in Barking has been discontinued. (b) Supervision of Food Preparing Premises. The number of premises in the district at the end of the year at which the following foods are prepared were:- Sausages 17 Potted Meat and Brawn 2 Roast and/or Boiled Ham 4 Pressed, Pickled, Cooked, etc. Beef and Tongue 30 Roast Pork - Bacon - Boiled Crabs and Lobsters 2 Pickled Fish 2 Pickled Onions etc. 1 Snoked Fish 6 Bakehouses 10 20 (c) Unsound Food. The Wartime control has resulted in an increase in the amount of food surrendered. The following list can "be regarded as representing the whole of the food retailed in the district found unfit for consumption. Provisions 620 lbs. Sugar 122 " Tea 7 " Jams, Marmalade, Syrup. 77 " Chocolates 57 " Cake, "biscuits etc. 62 " Snail cakes, pies, tarts, etc. 429 " Prunes 25 " Vegetables 7½ tons. Meat 2,678 lbs. Pish. 123 stone. Eggs 205 Cereals 1,702 lbs. Canned goods 2,032 tins. 3. POOD POISONING. There were four cases of food poisoning notified during the year. 4. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1938, SAMPLING. During the year, your authorised officers have submitted a total of 170 samples, divided as follows Milk 18 Butter & Margarine 2 Others. 150 170 The reports of the Borough Analysts, Dr. B. Iyer and Dr. J. H. Hamenoe, Great Tower Street, London, E. C., show that of this total, twentyfour were found not genuine. In connection with these unsatisfactory samples, which consisted chiefly of food substitutes, proceedings were instituted. In one case an appeal was heard in the King's Bench Division, and was allowed against the Corporation. The article in question was marketed as a cordial. Subsequent Ministry of Food Regulations have obviated the need for any further action. 5. CHEMICAL AND BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF FOOD. The bacteriological examination of all milk, and water samples is carried out for this Authority "by the Counties Public Health Laboratories, of Gidea Park College, Essex, whilst the examination of samples of milk for the presence of tubercle is carried out by Dr. A.L. Sheather, of Chorley Wood, Herts. - 21 - SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. 1. NOTIFICATION. The following table shows the number of notifications of infectious diseases (other than tuberculosis) received during 1942:- DISEASE. Total. Total cases removed to Hospital. Deaths.

It is a matter for congratulation, that of the 18 cases noted to have Cerebro Spinal Fever, 8 were found on careful examination, to be suffering from some other disease. Cerebro Spinal Fever, if it is to be treated successfully must be hospitalised at once. It is also highly desirable from the standpoint of the public that such cases should be sent to hospital at once. The figures I have submitted to you show that cases whioh are highly suspicious, as well as those which ultimately prove to be Cerebro Spinal Fever, are admitted to hospital. 22 2. HOSPITALISATION. Hiring the year 1942, cases of Infectious Disease requiring hospitalisation were admitted to the Ilford Isolation Hospital, Plaistow Fever, Rush Green Isolation, Walthamstow, Enfield, Billericay, Grays, Waltham Cross and also Hospitals of the London County Council. The following table shows the oases dealt with at Hospitals during the year:- Disease. In hospital 31st. Dec. 1941. Admitted during year. Died, Discharged. In hospital 31st. Dec. 1942.

The notification of "Acute Primary Pneumonia" in the case of children under five years is interesting, because for the period of just over two years we have received thirty-three notifications, twenty-nine of which have come from five only doctors in the town. I think that there must be a wide divergence of views as to the clinical picture which indicates a diagnosis of "Acute Primary Pneumonia" in young children. 5. CEREBRO SPINAL MININGITIS. During the year ended 31st December, 1942, there were ten cases of meningitis in Barking. Of this number three were females and seven males. 4 Cases occurred in January. 1 Case " " June. 3 Cases " " July. 1 Case " " September. 1 Case " " December. Of these ten cases, the diagnoses of which were confirmed by the hospitals, nine were hospitalised in Ilford Isolation Hospital and one was notified by Oldchurch. The following is the classification of types:- Cerebro Spinal Meningitis - 8 cases. Pneumonocoocal " - 1 case. Tubercular " - 1 case. Age groups. The following is a table of incidence in the various age groups 1-5 years. 1 Male, 2 Females. 5-10 " 2 Males. 10 - 15 " 1 Male. 15 - 20 " 3 Males. 20-30 " 1 Female. The case of Pneumonococcal Meningitis included in the above figure occurred in a boy aged 8 years, and the case of Tubercular Meningitis was also a boy, aged 16 years. There was only one death, this being the case of Tubercular Meningitis, which is included in the number of deaths from Tuberculosis. All other cases recovered. On enquiry no connection between the cases was found. Details are given below;- Occupat ion. Female. 1 yr. 2 mnths. Cerebro Spinal Meningitis. Nil. Female. 28 years. " " " Household duties.

Details are as follows:- 2 cases proved to "be Meningismus. 1 case " " " Influenza. 1 case " " " Pneumonia. 1 case " " " Tuberculous Peritonitis. 1case " " " Tabes Dorsalis. 1 case " " " Gingivitis. 1 case " " " Bronchitis. TOTAL. 8 FINDINGS. It will be seen from the above figures that twice as many males as females were attacked with meningitis, and all but two cases were of the crebro spinal type. Pour of the cases occurred in January, and three in July, which does not seem to give any indication of any special infection period. Eighteen cases were notified, and there were only ten actual cases. Two cases wre canoelled from the weekly return, and in one of these the diagnosis of "Tubercular Meningitis" was substituted for "Cerebro Spinal Meningitis", making a final return of sixteen cases notified to the County and the Ministry. 5.

Information has been received of the removal into the district of 28 tuberculous persons, included in the number of notifications reoeived - three of these are old oases returned to Barking. This compares with 37 received during 1941- and 48 for 1940). 25 Statistics in relation to Tuberculosis for the years 1939 to 1942 are given below Year 1939 Year 1940 Year 1941 Year 1942 NEW CASES NOTIFIED.

Three hundred and thirty-four notifications of scarlet fever were received during the year, the number for 1941 being ninety-three. This shows a considerable increase but the type of infection was not severe. You, as a Council, in the latter part of the year, with due approval of the Minister of Health, set up ways and means whereby a temporary supply of medicine and medical assistance (including nursing), could be provided for inhabitants of the district where hospitalisation could not be arranged. Facilities for hospitalisation of infectious diseases are now reasonable, but in the year under review (1942) our difficulties in this respect were indeed great; accommodation for such cases was in great demand and we, in common with others, experiaiced great difficulty in securing the admission of patients, and on occasion patients had to be admitted to hospitals so far distant as Billericay and Enfield. 8. WHOOPING COUGH. Notifications of this disease show a considerable decrease, the total number being two hundred and ninety, whereas in the year 1941, six hundred and fifty-eight cases were notified. Whooping cough is a disease very difficult to diagnose. Children can have this complaint without 'whooping' even once and not all cases who 'whoop' are definitely suffering from whooping cough. Figures, therefore, must always be taken with reserve. 9. MEASLES. The incidence of this disease during the middle of the year was somewhat high. On the other hand, the total cases for the whole of the year numbered 1,260 which shows a slight decrease compared with notifications during the year 1941. 26 10. DIPHTHERIA. An immunisation campaign was commenced in November. There was some increase in the incidence of diphtheria, the number of notifications being fifty-seven, whereas in the previous year there were thirty-one. With the intense drive which we are-making against diphtherial and if the public will continue to avail themselves of the services provided, it may be that diphtheria may become a disease much less known than it is today, and still less known and dreaded than it was a generation ago. It seems, therefore, that for the information of the people today, and particularly for the information of the people tomorrow, some few remarks on this illness should be included in such a report as this. Prom the work which we have done on severe cases of diphtheria amongst whom there is a high percentage of mortality, it seems clear that the patient is suffering from a mixed infection, and that streptococci as well as the germs of diphtheria are present. I would also like to put on record that, whilst the prevention of diphtheria by inoculation is the public health measure which at this stage of our medical information is the proper measure to adopt, we in Barking, previous to inoculation, obtained a considerable amount of success by reason of the fact that the closest co-operation existed between the general medical practitioners on the one hand, and my self and my staff on the other, which resulted in the early diagnosis of diphtheria and the early administration of anti-toxin. In congratulating ourselves on the availability of immunisation to prevent diphtheria, we must not forget the very valuable help which the early administration of anti-toxin has afforded us, not only in successfully treating diphtheria, but also in directly helping to prevent the spread of diphtheria. 11. ARTIFICIAL IMMUNISATION. The total number of children inoculated against diphtheria during the year was 1,662 as compared with 2,047 in 1941. Immunisation against whooping cough and scarlet fever was carried out simultaneously, the total number of children inoculated against these two complaints being respectively, 327 and 340. Table of Statistics - Year 1942. Toddlers. Schoolchildren. Total. Inoculations against Diphtheria. 1,027 635 1,662 Inoculations against Scarlet Fever. 186 154 340 Inoculations against Whooping cough. 2 46 81 327 27 12. VENEREAL DISEASE. Venereal Disease is treated at the Country Hospital, Oldchurch, and at other general hospitals, particularly the clinic in Turner Street (London Hospital). Your officers have not noted any significant increase in Venereal Disease during the war period, but, of course, they deal only with that section of the public covered by the services shown in this report. 13. GENERAL. I Was recently asked to go to Chelmsford to meet the Standing Committee of medical men which deals with epidemics, which shows that we are alive to such problems. Since the war we have been relatively free from epidemic diseases throughout the whole country, Barking having shared this favourable national position, the amount of infectious diseases in Barking comparing not unfavourably with other parts of the Country. 28
