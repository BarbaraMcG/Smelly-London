The Past Year. This Report embraces the period from the 26th day of March, 1896, to the 25th day of March, 1897. During this period 80 Meetings of the Board and Committees have been held, of which the following are particulars :— Board Meetings— Ordinary 20 Special 3 Total 23 Committee Meetings— Finance 18 Law and Parliamentary 5 Sanitary 13 Works 21 Total — 57 Making in all a total of 80 9 The Work of the Year. This report contains a summary of the more important proceedings of the Board. It would be quite impossible in the space at disposal to enumerate the whole of the work and the many important matters of detail which are continually brought before the Board and its Committees. Mr. Willoughby has continued to act as Chairman of the Board, having at the meeting on the 9th day of June, 1896, been unanimously re-elected to that important position. Changes in the Personnel of the Board. Considerable changes have taken place in the membership of the Board during the year under review. At the election of members in June, 1896, Messrs. Maurice Angel, Edward J. Coleman, Joshua H. Gudgeon, Kichard J. Harnell, John Milner, Edward Upton, and Philip Yallentine were elected in the place of Messrs. William Henry Fenton, Edward Lawrence Jones, John Martindale, John Horsley Mayo, Gilbert Smith, Charles James "Wainwright and John "Waters. Three vacancies have occurred during the year, two of which were caused by the resignation of James F. Corben, Esq., and Thomas H. D. Berridge, Esq., the other by the death of Walter Blott, Esq. All these gentlemen had been for many years members of the Board and its various Committees. Mr. Blott at the time of his death was Chairman of the Works Committee. 10 Accounts. The accounts of the Board for the past year have been prepared in the same form as heretofore, and after being examined by the Board's Chartered Accountant, have been investigated by the elected Auditors, whose certificate of the result of their examination will be found appended at the foot of the accounts on page 45. The comparative statement of Income and Expenditure which has been published during the last few years has been again prepared, and is as follows :— COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENDITURE For the years ending 25th March, 1896, and 25th J fare h, 1897.

St. Giles Public Library. The proceedings of the Commissioners, who are a body corporate and elected under the Pubic Libraries Act, 1892, 12 are published in a separate report which contains much useful and interesting information, and a statement of their receipts and expenditure. During the year an election of a Commissioner has been rendered necessaryowing to the removal of Mr. T. H. D. Berridge from the district, to fill whose place Dr. S. Clewin Griffith was on the 9th February elected. Equalisation of Rates. In the last report reference was made to the Census which was then about to be taken. The result so far as the St. Giles District was concerned was accurately anticipated, the return showing that the population had decreased from 39,778, the figure at which it was enumerated in 1891, to 38,237. This has added still further to the amount payable by the District towards the fund established pursuant to the London Equalisation of Rates Act, 1894. Improvements. It is to be regretted that no steps have yet been taken with a view to carrying out what is admitted to be an obvious necessity, viz., new means of communication north and south between High Holborn and the Strand. The most important improvement which has engaged attention during the year has been the proposal of the London County Council, made largely in consequence of the course adopted by the Board, for the removal of the block of buildings standing between Bozier's Court and Tottenham Court Road. A Bill enabling this improvement to be carried out is at the present time before the 13 Honse of Commons, and it is to be hoped that it will pass into law and that this much-needed improvement will be carried out without further delay. The minor improvements consisted of the widening of Keppel Street and Montague Place by the setting back of the projecting garden walls. Also a proposal for the straightening of the line of frontage of the houses on the east side of Southampton Row, the opportunity offered by the rebuilding of the premises having been taken advantage of to effect this improvement. One of the most important improvements which has been under the consideration of the Board is for effecting the widening of Portsmouth Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, to 30 feet. Considerable difficulty has occurred in consequence of a portion of the property required for effecting the improvement being in the area under the control of the Strand District Board of Works. The matter is still the subject of negotiation, and it is hoped that the endeavours that are being made to carry out the widening of this thoroughfare will be successful. Clare Market Improvement Scheme. This was a scheme promoted by the London County Council with a view of dealing with an unhealthy area lying between Stanhope Street, Catherine Street, Kemble Street, and the Strand. The only way in which the St. Giles District was affected was in consequence of the proposal of the Council to take the whole of the houses on the south side of 14 Kemble Street, between Drury Lane and Stanhope Street, for the purpose of effecting a street widening. The Board were represented at the Enquiry which was held by order of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who ultimately made an order approving of the scheme subject to certain modifications. Owing to the late period at which the approval was signified it was impossible to obtain the necessary Parliamentary sanction, but steps are being taken to ensure this during the present Session of Parliament. London Sea Water Supply Bill. This Bill received the Royal assent on the 20th July, 1896, but no steps have yet been taken to carry out the powers conferred by it. Verminous Persons Bill. This measure, introduced into the House of Commons by a member of the Board, Walter Hazell, Esq., M.P., proposes to confer upon Local Authorities power to incur expense for the purpose of cleansing and disinfecting persons infected with vermin without in any way treating them as paupers. The Bill puts no compulsion on Local Authorities, but is of a permissive character. It is feared that there are a very large number of persons coming within the scope of the Act, and the Board, feeling that it would be an advantage to Society in general that such persons should be cleansed and disinfected free of charge, presented a Petition to the House of Commons in favour 15 of the Bill. The measure is at the present time awaiting second reading. School Board for London Elections Bill. This Bill was introduced into the House of Commons by Sir John Blundell Maple, M.P., with a view of abolishing the existing divisions of the County of London for School Board electoral purposes, and substituting the existing Parliamentary divisions for the purpose. The Board have for many years been of opinion that the existing arrangements for the elections were unsatisfactory, and that it would conduce to greater efficiency and economy if the representatives were elected for smaller areas and so brought more closely into contact with their constituents, and they accordingly presented a Petition to the House of Commons in favour of the Bill, but on the measure coming on for second reading it was rejected. Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway Bill. This Bill proposes to extend the time granted by the Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway Act, 1894, to construct a railway from Charing Cross to Hampstead, but as the Bill did not propose to confer any farther powers upon the Company, no action was taken. North Metropolitan Tramways No. 1 Bill. In accordance with the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, the North Metropolitan Tramways Company 16 deposited with the Board plans and copies of the Bill, seeking powers to extend their tramway from its present terminus in Theobald's Road to Bury Street, and applied for the necessary consent to proceed with their Bill. The matter was referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee for consideration and report, and a deputation of inhabitants having attended the Board and presented a Memorial against the application, it was decided to refuse consent, and the Bill was accordingly withdrawn. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. A Bill for amending the law relating to the Sale of Food and Drugs was introduced into the House of Commons. The Board being of opinion that it was necessary that legislation should be introduced by the Local Government Board with a view of giving effect to the report of the Select Committee on Food Products Adulteration, took no action on the proposed Bill. Communications have, however, been addressed to the Local Government Board urging that the time has arrived when fresh legislation on the subject should take place. The proceedings of the Board under the existing Sale of Food and Drugs Acts are referred to in another portion of this report. London Government. No action has been taken by the London County Council upon the Report of the Conference held on their invitation between the members of the Council and the 17 Representatives of Local Authorities. Petitions have been presented by certain of the governing bodies of the Metropolis praying that Charters of Incorporation might be conferred upon them. The Board have consistently declined to take any action in the matter, thinking it was unnecessary for them to interfere with the views of authorities with whose affairs they had no concern. Congress of Public Health. In response to an invitation received from the Lord Provost of Glasgow, the Clerk to the Board and the Medical Officer of Health were appointed to attend the Glasgow Congress of the British Institute of Public Health in the month of July, 1896, and at a meeting of the Board on the 13th October, 189G, the proceedings of the Congress were reported and the thanks of the Board accorded to the Clerk to the Board and the Medical Officer of Health for their attendance and report. Seats in Shaftesbury Avenue. Complaints were again received during the year as to the nuisance caused by persons making use of the seats at the entrance to Shaftesbury Avenue from New Oxford Street, erected by the Board a few years since. Believing that the complaints were well founded the Board determined to apply to the London County Council for permission to remove the seats which were constructed round the lamp, and which were complained of, and to place C 18 seats without backs upon the piece of land; but the application was unsuccessful. London Hydraulic Power Company. During the year permission has been granted to this Company to extend their mains in various streets in the District for the purpose of supplying hydraulic power to the premises of various ratepayers. Drainage Bye-laws. In the course of the year the London County Council forwarded for the observations of the Board draft byelaws proposed to be made under the 202nd section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, for regulating the dimensions, form, mode of construction and the keeping cleansing, and repairing of the pipes, dizains, and other means of communication with sewers, and the traps and apparatus connected therewith. The draft was very carefully considered, and suggestions were made for certain modifications; but no further communication has been received from the London County Council upon the subject. Telegraphic Facilities. In the month of April a communication was received from the inhabitants in the northern portion of the district suggesting the extension of the Telegraphs to the Torrington Place Post Office. Believing that the want of facilities caused considerable inconvenience the Board directed a 19 communication to be addressed to the Secretary of the General Post Office in favour of the proposal, and in the course of the year the suggestion was acceded to, and the office made available for the despatch of telegrams. This concession has been of great convenience to many of the ratepayers. New Post Office in the District. The attention of the Board having been drawn to the proposal of the Office of Works to erect a new Post Office in Hyde Street, suggestions were made that the building should be so constructed that the Mail Carts should not be loaded and unloaded in the public streets. The influence of Sir Charles Hall, K.C.M.G., Q.C., M.P., was secured in the matter, but without success, the Postmaster-General, His Grace the Duke of Norfolk, intimating that the Treasury for reasons stated were unable to sanction compliance with the Board's request. The new building is now in course of erection. Sanitary Work. The monthly synopsis of sanitary Avork which is forwarded to every member affords a useful record of the steps taken for preserving the public health in the District. Calculated on the information published month by month the following statistics are obtained :— Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Visits and inspections made 11,291 Notices for abatement of nuisances served 847 Proceedings before Police Magistrates 23 c 2 20 Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, 16 representations were made by the Medical Officer of Health, and the necessary steps taken, with a view to closing the premises. The following are the particulars:— Locality. Present Condition of Premises. 2, Drury Lane Demolished. 3, do. do. 4, do. do. 27, Compton Street Repaired and reopened as one premises. 29, do. 16, Drury Lane Demolished. 23, Short's Gardens do. 32, Marchmont Street Repaired and reopened. 2, Wild Court In course of reconstruction. 3, do. do. 4, do. do. 5, do. do. 1, Marahs Buildings Closed. 2, do. do. 3, do. do. 178, Drury Lane Undergoing alteration and renovation. Lodging House Regulations. Number of houses on the Register 429 Notices to abate breaches served 334 Proceedings taken 3 Number of additional houses registered during the year 51 Underground Rooms. The question of whether the Board should exercise the powers conferred upon them by the 98th Section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and permit certain underground rooms which were not strictly in accordance 21 with the provisions of the Act, but which had, under the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts, been occupied for many years, was under consideration, and it was decided, after receiving reports from the principal Officers of the Board, who personally visited the rooms, that the Board would be well advised to relax the very stringent provisions of the Act of 1891 with regard to the rooms in question. Deaths From Measles. The large death-rate from measles referred to in the monthly reports of the Medical Officer of Health caused further communications to be made to the Local Government Board in favour of measles being included in the list of notifiable diseases referred to in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Ultimately the Local Government Board suggested that the London County Council should be invited to make an order extending the scope of the Act to all London. Communications were accordingly addressed to the London County Council in the matter, but no answer has yet been received. Sale oe Food and Drugs Acts. 377 samples of food and drugs were purchased and analysed during the year. The Analyst's report, which will be found on page 64, contains full particulars. It is sufficient here to remark that of the samples purchased 57 were adulterated, but in 15 cases the adulteration was not sufficient to justify any proceedings being taken ; in the other cases prosecutions 22 ensued, and fines and costs amounting in the whole to £32 l1s. were inflicted. The practice of using minute portions of copper for preserving peas received special consideration at the hands of the Sanitary Committee, and a number of samples were taken, but the very minute quantity of copper which was discovered in the samples, the largest being 0'559 grains of copper to the lb., was so small that it would not have been prudent to take any action. Public Lavatories. In the last report it was stated that the Board were about to undertake the enlargement of the Public Lavatory, constructed in New Oxford Street, at the junction of Charing Cross Road, opened in September, 1895. The work then contemplated was to increase the number of water-closets for women from 6 to 8 and for men from 12 to 15, and to add 4 urinals. This work was speedily carried out, and the additions to the lavatory available for public use in the month of September, 1896. A reference to the audited accounts will show that the decision of the Board to construct this lavatory was a wise one, the gross takings during the past year amounted to no less a sum than £1,281. Believing that there was a necessity for an extension of these conveniences in the District the Board have determined to construct a third underground convenience, the situation decided upon being the wide part of High 23 Holborn by the Royal Music Hall. The contract for the work amounting to the sum of £3,697 was entrusted to Messrs. C. W. Killingback & Co., of Camden Town, and it is hoped that the convenience will be available for public use by the end of August next. Employees' Holiday. Following the precedent laid down in 1894, the Board again granted the whole of their employees a day's holiday, and voted a sum of £10 as an addition to the workmen's wages. The outing took place on the 27th June and was to Ramsgate, and was as successful as on previous occasions. HENRY C. JONES, Clerk to the Board.

Engineer's and Surveyor's Department, 197, High Holborn, W.C., June 15 th, 1897. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the following Report on the Works executed by your Board during the year ending 25th March, 1897. Pavings. Carriage-ways. Situation. Description of Paving.

The macadamized roads in the District were repaired and made good with broken granite where necessary, a steam roller being used to level the surface. Maintenance of Asphalte Carriage-way Pavements. During the year, contracts were entered into between your Board and the several Contractors, who laid the different pavements, for a further maintenance for 15 years of the following streets at the prices named:— Per yard superficial, per annum. s. d. Shaftesbury Avenue, by New Oxford Street 0 10Do., from Broad Street to Gt. St. Andrew Street 1 0 Bedford Avenue 0 4 Endell Street 0 10 Great Coram Street, from Kenton St. to Hunter St. 0 6 Maynard Street 0 3 Lawrence Street 0 3 Neal's Yard 0 3 48 Daring the early part of the year 1 897 the asphalte carriage way pavements in a portion of High Holborn and in New Oxford Street became in exceedingly bad repair, numerous small holes in the asphalte showing themselves over the whole surface. The Val-de-Travers Asphalte Paving Company, who laid the pavings, endeavoured to the utmost to repair these holes as they showed themselves, but the weather was so wet, raining almost continuously day and night for several weeks, that they were unable to do any effective work, during which time the paving became worse and worse, necessitating the use of ballast to fill up the holes and render the streets safe for traffic. The paving in New Oxford Street had then been down for 1.3 years, and the Company, after some considerable negociations between them and the Works Committee of the Board, ultimately made the following proposition, which was accepted by the Board and finally acted upon, viz., that the existing Contract for maintenance which would have expired in 1900, be cancelled, and that upon the Company taking up the existing asphalte paving and laying a new asphalte surface at its own expense, a new Contract for maintenance for 12 years at 2s. per yard superficial, per annum, be entered into. This was done by the Company and the street opened to the public traffic on 8th April last. The paving of High Holborn was thoroughly repaired by the Company as soon as the weather permitted, and is 49 now in fair travelling order, but the condition of the asphalte is such that ere long some similar course to that adopted for New Oxford Street will have to be taken. Sewers. The following Sewer works were performed during the year :— Denmark Place New flushing tank. High Holborn 60ft. run new 4ft. by 2ft. 6in. connection made between the east and west sewers. Keppel Mews, North 790ft. run old sewer repaired and underpinned. Russell Mews 150ft. run new 12in. pipe sewer. The old sewer, which ran beneath what was formerly Brewer Street, having become useless, in consequence of the demolition of the houses in Shelton Street, was filled up and abandoned. The old pipe sewer in New Turnstile was found to be completely blocked up with solid matter, and had consequently to be taken up and a new 18in. pipe sewer laid, with brick flushing tank at its head, at a cost of £123, the work being performed by the Board's own workmen. New manholes were constructed in connection with the old Sewers in Ridgmount Gardens, Ridgmount Street,, and Southampton Mews. e 50 Drains. 134 applications were received during the year for the construction of new and reconstruction or partial reconstruction of existing drains at 140 private premises within the District. The whole of the work laid was tested by the Board's officials before being covered in; the fees received in respect of the same amounted to £29 15s. Flushing of Sewers and Surfaces of Courts. The following sewers were flushed by water obtained from the New River Company's mains during the summer months; the quantity of water used was 1,665,825 gallons:— Abbey Place. Alfred Mews. Bainbridge Street. Bernard Mews. Calsen Yard. Bedford Avenue. Charlotte Mews. Chapel Yard. Church Passage. Charing Cross Road. Clarke's Buildings. Compton Mews. Denmark Place. Hyde Street. Dunn's Passage. Galen Place. Gate Street. George Yard. Goldsmith Street. Gower Mews. Great Turnstile. Hall's Yard. Henrietta Mews. Kennedy Court. Monarch Yard. Lawrence Street. Lascelles Place.

Bloomsbury Court. Clarke's Buildings. Denmark Place. ♦Dunn's Passage. ♦Drury Lane. ♦Galen Place. *Gate Street. George Yard. Green Dragon Yard. Great Turnstile. ♦Hall's Yard.

Sardinia Place. ♦Shelton Street. ♦Southampton Mews. Stacey Street. Tichborne Court. ♦Tower Street. Twyford Buildings. Vine Street. *Wild Court. The streets in the above list marked with an asterisk were flushed the whole year round. Street Cleansing. The cleansing of the public ways in the District was performed by a staff employed directly by the Board, numbering 50 men, consisting of one foreman, five gangers, and 44 sweepers. In addition to the manual labour employed, two sweeping machines; drawn by horses, were used in sweeping the carriage-ways. The street sweepings carried away during the year amounted to a total of 6,493 van-loads, equal to over e 2 52 19,000 cubic yards. There were also removed 1,799 vanloads of refuse matter taken from the gully pits, and 28 van-loads from the sewers, together amounting to nearly 5,500 cubic yards. The carriage-ways of the main thoroughfares were washed frequently during the year by means of water distributed by watering carts. The cost of this washing is included in the two items for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter. The main thoroughfares in the District were watered twice on Sundays during the summer months, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., and the market streets between 12 and 2.30 when the condition of the weather rendered it desirable. In the latter watering, disinfectants were added to the contents of the carts. Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year, including the Sunday work, was as follows :— £ s. d. Wages of men 2,984 9 8 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men 563 13 7 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, and hire of horses for street-sweeping machines, removal of manure, &c. 3,545 1 8 Removal of snow, additional labour, cartage, &c. 245 13 11 Water for flushing surfaces of courts, Ac. 155 11 4 £7,494 10 2 53 Street Watering. The watering of the public-ways was performed by contract, the Contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. A small hand water-cart was employed to water tlnse courts and alleys in the District not available for vehicular traffic, or which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The total quantity of water used, including that used for washing the surfaces of the asphalte and wood paved roads, amounted to 6,319,000 gallons. During the summer months, permanganate of potash was added to the contents of the watering carts, one ounce being used to 400 gallons of water. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs to stand posts, &c., was £296 7 5 To contractor for horses, carts, and drivers 1,005 8 0 For permanganate of potash 22 15 0 £1,324 10 5 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the Contractor providing all necessary carts, horses and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £3,650. The refuse removed amounted to 10,309 van-loads, equal to over 30,000 cubic yards. The disinfection of the dust-bins in the District with carbolic acid powder, after their contents had been removed by the Contractor's men, was continued during the year, the cost of the disinfectant used being £11 10s. 54 Limewhiting Courts. The walls at the entrances to the following yards, courts, mews, &c., in the District, were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year, at a cost of £43 5s. Compton Mews. Denmark Place. Dunn's Passage. Hall's Yard. Henrietta Mews. Hunter Mews. Kennedy Court. Lascelles Court. Little Guilford Street. Middle Yard. Neal's Yard. New Yard. Nottingham Court Plummer's Court. Portsmouth Place. Queen's Head Yard. Sardinia Place. Sardinia Street. Silver Street. Southampton Mews. Tavistock Mews. Woburn Mews. Underground Conveniences. New Oxford Street. The enlargement of this convenience, which was found necessary almost immediately after the opening of the original structure, in consequence of the large demand for accommodation, was completed by the Contractors and opened to the public use on the 10th day of July, 1896. Shaftesbury Avenue. The question of the retention of a water closet for men and women in this convenience, as well as in that in New Oxford Street, free of charge, was again under the consideration of the Board, who finally resolved to discontinue allowing the free use of the same in consequence of the abuse and ill-usage to which they were put, and they were accordingly closed to free use on the 27th day of January, 1896. 55 High Holborn. For some years past it has been suggested from time to time to the Board, the desirability of forming a new underground place of convenience for the use of men and women in High Holborn, near to the junction with Little Turnstile, and in December last a resolution to construct one at that spot was come to by the Board. Numerous sketches of alternative schemes were prepared by your Engineer, and considered by your "Works Committee, who recommended the adoption of a design which provided for the erection of 14 water closets, 16 urinals and three lavatories for men, and nine water closets and three lavatories for women, at an estimated cost of £3,671. This was approved by the Board. The necessary contract drawings and specification were then prepared by your Engineer, and a contract let by public competition on the 9th day of February, 1897, to Messrs. C. W. Killingback and Co., to construct the same for £3,697. The work was commenced on the 22nd February last. The work was considerably delayed soon after its commencement by reason of the old cast-iron pneumatic tube, which was constructed some 30 years ago as a means of communication for letters and post office parcels between St. Martin's-le-. Grand and Euston Station, but had been abandoned for many years. Negociations with the parties who claimed to have interest in the said tube, and the subsequent demolition of the tube caused a virtual stoppage of the work for several weeks; but they are now proceeding with fair despatch, and will, I hope, be completed in about two to three months. 56 Public Urinals. The public urinal in Lascelles Court, which has been at all times a subject of complaint from the inhabitants of the adjacent houses looking on to the Court, was removed by the Board on the 6th day of April, 1897, it being considered that it was now no longer necessary, the underground convenience in Shaftesbury Avenue being so immediately near to it. The Urinal in Parker Street, which had also been the subject of frequent complaint from the owners of adjacent houses, as well as from the public, was removed on the 10th December, 1896, and it is satisfactory to say that no complaint of nuisance has been received from any one since its removal. The following is a list of the public urinals above ground in the St. Giles District :— Colonnade 6 compartments. Dunn's Passage 5 „ Galen Place 3 ,, Little Guilford Street 4 „ Morwell Street 3 „ Seven Dials 6 „ Short's Gardens 6 „ Southampton Mews 2 „ Torrington Mews 1 „ Whetstone Park 3 „ The quantity of water used at the whole of the urinals within the District, excluding the two underground conveniences, during the year was 2,910,000 gallons. Public Lighting. In January, 1896, the Lighting Corporation, who had acquired the interests of the Wenham Lamp Co., 57 made application to your Board to be allowed to place a number of the Wenham lamps on public lamp-posts in the District. The matter was referred to your Works Committee, who, after consideration, recommended that the company be allowed at their own expense to fix two of their lamps for experimental piirposes, one on the refuge in High Holborn, east of Little Queen Street, and the other on the refuge at the junction of New Oxford Street and Shaftesbury Avenue, which lamps were fixed in April, 1896, and still remain. No alteration has been made during the year to the other lamps in the District, the total number of which is 1,160, made up as under :— Lamp-posts with well lanterns 729 Ditto with square lanterns 155 Old lamp-posts with square lanterns 13 Metered lamps on street-crossing refuges 12 Bracket lamps with well lanterns 147 Ditto with old square lanterns 104 Total 1,160 The amount paid for gas, including the lighting and extinguishing, cleansing and maintenance of the lanterns, was £4,088 8s. lOd. Street Orderly Bins, &c. Several additional street orderly bins and ballast bins have been erected during the year. The total number now in the District is given on page 61. St. Giles Churchyard. This continues to be largely used by the poorer classes in the neighbourhood as a place of rest, and is evidently 58 largely appreciated; but unfortunately during the dinnerhour a large number of boys from neighbouring factories resort there, and by their horse-play and roughness of behaviour cause much annoyance to others using the grounds and damage to the plants and shrubs placed there by the Board; and it has been found absolutely necessary to supplement the services of the keeper by another man during the best part of the day to prevent the nuisance as far as possible. Tree Planting. Bedford Avenue. Application was made to your Board by the owners of Bedford Court Mansions, the name given to the block of buildings on the south side of Bedford Avenue (formerly Caroline Mews) requesting that trees should be planted on both sides of the street. On examination of the site, however, it was found there was not sufficient space on the south side of the road between the street surface and the house vaults to allow of this being done, but the request of the owners was acceded to as far as the north side was concerned, on condition that they contributed towards the cost. This they did to the extent of £25, and the Board thereupon planted 15 plane trees along the north side. Great Russell Street. Fifteen plane trees were also planted by the Board along the footway on the north side of Great Russell Street, in front of the British Museum, which footway had previously been widened by the Board, under arrangement with the Museum authorities. 59 Hydraulic Power Mains. Cast-iron pipes for the supply of hydraulic pressure has been laid during the year in the following streets in the District, permission to do so having been first obtained from the Board:— Charing Cross Road branch from Subway to Lloyd's Court. Drury Lane from Kemble Street to Broad Street. Gate Street from Little Queen Street to Princes Square. High Holborn from Southampton Row to Blooms- bury Court. Kingsgate Street from Theobald's Road to High Holborn. Little Queen Street from High Holborn to Gate Street. Museum Street from Broad Street to New Oxford Street. New Oxford Street crossing by Museum Street. Street Refuges. No additional refuge has been formed during the year within the District. The following is a list of those now existing:— Bedford Place south end. Broad Street east of Endell Street. Charing Cross Road north end, by High Street. Do. by New Compton Street.

I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, G. WALLACE, Engineer and Surveyor. ANALYST'S REPORT. Clerkenwell Town Hall, Rosebeey Avenue, E.C., 26th May, 1897. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you a report upon the samples submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act during the year ending the 31st March, 1897. The total number of samples examined during the twelve months was 375—a larger number than in the four preceding years, when the figures were as follows :— 1892-3 220 1893-4 266 1894-5 348 1895-6 318 Of the 375 samples submitted during the past year 186 were brought to me by Inspector William Henry Bond and 189 by Inspector John Robinson. In the following table will be found a list of the 65 articles analysed, showing how many have been examined during each quarter of the year:— ARTICLE. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter.

For comparison the results of the four previous years are here given:— Year. No. of Samples examined. No. Adulterated. Percentage of Adulterations. 1892-3 220 19 8.6 1893-4 266 51 19.1 1894-5 348 45 12.9 1895-6 318 29 9.1 Notwithstanding the increase in the number of samples taken during this year, the percentage of adulteration is considerably above the average. MILK. Very great attention has again been paid to the quality of the milk supplied to the District, no less than 237 samples of this most important article of food having been F 66 purchased for analysis. That the collection of so large a number of samples was amply justified is evidenced by the fact that no fewer than 44 (18'5 per cent.) were found to be adulterated, while 10 others were certified to be of poor quality. The necessity of maintaining a proper milk supply cannot be too strongly insisted on, not only from public health considerations, but from an economic point of view. It has been estimated that the average consumption of milk is 15 gallons yearly per head of population. At the average rate of fourpence per quart this gives £1 as the expenditure per head. Thus, in the St. Giles District, nearly £40,000 per annum is spent upon this one article of food alone. The nature and amount of the adulteration in each case is as follows:— No. of Sample.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I beg to present herewith my Annual Report upon the Vital Statistics of St. Giles District for the Registration Year ending 31st December, 1896 (53 weeks). Area. The District of St. Giles comprises an area of 245 statute acres. For civil registration purposes it is divided into three sub-districts, viz:— 1. St. George, Bloomsbury. 2. St. Giles, South. 3. St. Giles, North. Houses. The number of inhabited houses (Census 1891) was 3,729. The average number of persons in each house was 10.6. 73 Density. According to the supplement to the Fifty-fifth Annual Report of the Registrar-General, the density of population in five decennia in St. Giles' District was:— Acres to a Person. 1841-50. 1851-60. 1861-70. 1871-80. 1881-90. •005. .005. .005. .005. 006. Census 1896. In March last the first Quinquennial Census was taken of the population in each of the civil parishes in the Administrative County of London, so that the Local Government Board might be in a position to inform the London County Council of the exact number of persons inhabiting each sanitary district, in order that the sixpenny rate levied under the Equalisation of Rates Act, 1894, might be apportioned upon the basis of population in each district. According to the official return of that Census published by the Registrar-General, the total population of the administrative County of London was 4,411,710, an increase of 199,967 since 1891. This return shows that the ratio of increase of population within Registration or Inner London has been smaller than the rate that prevailed during the ten years 1881-91. The actual decline in population in Central London, owing to the substitution of business premises for dwelling houses and the migration of the residents to suburban neighbourhoods, has long been in progress at an increasing rate. 74 Population. The enumerated population of the St. Giles District (Census 1896) is stated to be 38,237, a decrease of 14,462 persons between 1851 and 1896, as is shown in the following table:— Registration Sub-Districts. 1851 1861 1871. 1881. 1891. 1896.

The Population of the United Kingdom was estimated at 39,451,960 persons; that of England and Wales at 30,717,355, of Scotland at 4,186,849, and of Ireland at 4,547,756. Meteorology.

The registered births were 330 in excess of the •corrected deaths. The ratio of births to population was 1 in 35.9. The annual birth-rate, which in three preceding years was 27.4, 26.8, and 28.1, was 27.8 per 1,000 in 1896. The birth-rate of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was 15.9 per 1,000 higher than that of the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. The birth-rate of the Peabody buildings, Great Wild Street (40.4 per 1,000) again largely contributed to the higher birth-rate of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. According to the quarterly returns (furnished by the local Registrars), 135,796 births were registered in London 77 during the year 1896. The natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths was 52,285. The birth-rate was 30.2 per 1,000 of the population. This is the lowest London birth-rate on record. In England and Wales during the same period 917,201 births were registered, and the natural increase of births over deaths was 389,272. The birth-rate was equal to 29.7 per 1,000 of the population.

George, Bloomsbury 184 St. Giles, South 400 St. Giles, North 150 Total 734 The annual death-rate, which in the preceding three years had been 23.2, 18.7, and 21.3 respectively, was 19.1 per 1,000 in 1896, being 3.0 per 1,000 than the decennial average 1886-95. The death-rate for the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was 14.6 per 1,000 higher than the rate for the parish of Bloomsbury. The Registrar-General, in his fifty-fifth annual report, gives the annual mortality of St. Giles District, in five decennia, as follows:— Annual Mortality. (Deaths to 1,000 living.) 1841-50 1851-60 1861-70 1871-80 1881-90 25 27 27 234 21.0 The number of deaths in London during the year was: Males 43,069, females 40,442, persons 83,511, and corresponded to a rate of 18.6 per 1,000 of the population, the average death-rate in the previous ten years having been 20.1. In England and Wales 527,929 deaths were registered, equal to a death-rate of 1 7.1 per 1,000. 79 Infantile Mortality. Of the total registered deaths which took place last year no fewer than 162 occurred in infants under one year of age (as compared with 155, 144, and 185 in the three preceding years), and 92 between the ages of one and five years, or a total of 254 deaths amongst children under 5 years of age. The mortality of infants under 1 year was in the proportion of 152 deaths per 1,000 of registered births. In all London 21,853 infants died, corresponding to a rate of 161 per 1,000 births, as compared with an average rate of 155 in the ten years immediately preceding. In St. Giles the diseases which caused the greatest fatality were:—Measles, whooping-cough, diarrhoea, tubercular meningitis, premature birth, convulsions, bronchitis, pneumonia, and debility from birth. Senile Mortality. At 65 years and upwards there were 152 deaths, compared with 184, 152, and 173 in the preceding three years. These deaths occurred at the following advanced ages:— 51 between 65 and 70 years. 75 „ 70 „ 80 „ 26 „ 80 „ 90 „ 35 of the deaths were certified as "old age;" 117 of the remainder were caused from diseases of the brain, heart, and lungs. 80 Uncertified Deaths. Again in 1896 every death was certified either by the medical attendant or by the Coroner. In London, of the 208,534 deaths registered during the year, 3,147, or 1.5 per cent., were not certified. In England and "Wales there were 11,464 cases, or 2.2 per cent., in which the causes were not certified. Deaths in Public Institutions (within the District). 1.—The Workhouse, Endell Street. The number of deaths which occurred during the year amongst the inmates was:— 1st Quarter 29 2nd Quarter 20 3rd Quarter 25 4tli Quarter 34 Total 108 against 137, 141, and 147 in the three preceding years. In 1896 the average number of inmates was 543, and the annual death-rate was 19.8 per 1,000. The average rate for five years 1891-95 was 27.8 per 1,000. In addition to the deaths at the Workhouse there were 67 deaths of parishioners at the Central Sick Asylum, Cleveland Street, who were removed there for medical treatment. The number of infectious cases notified was 25, all from erysipelas. 81 2.—The French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. There were 47 deaths in this Institution during the year, against an average mortality of 36 for the 6 years during which the hospital has been opened. Forty of the deaths in 1896 were non-parishioners from outlying districts. Half of the deaths were caused from diseases of the lungs and air passages. There was no zymotic death. 3—The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. There were 4 deaths in the hospital during 1896, 1 mother and 3 children. The Hospital Staff report that during the year 202 women have been delivered in the wards, with one maternal death, viz., a poor woman from St. Marylebone parish, get. 23, died from" heart failure after Caesarean Section." In this case medical assistance was not sought until exhaustion had set in, and the chances of successful operative delivery seriously reduced. The total number of children born was 204; of these 3 died shortly after birth from debility and premature birth. In the Out-patient Department 333 women were delivered safely; 13 of the infants were born dead. G 82 Deaths in Hospitals, Lunatic Asylums, Workhouses, Infirmaries, and Sick Asylums (situated outside the District). From the returns furnished to me weekly from the Registrar-General's Office, Somerset House, the deaths of parishioners at Public Institutions outside the district, which in the three preceding years had been 272, 216, and 196 respectively, were 215 in 1896. The deaths occurred at the following institutions, viz.:— Public Institution. Number of Deaths. Public Institution. Number of Deaths.

There were 56 births, equal to a birth-rate of 40.4 per 1,000. The 26 deaths corresponded to an annual death-rate of 18.7 per 1,000. 17 children died under five years of age, 8 of these were from zymotic diseases, viz., measles 5, diphtheria 1, scarlet fever 1, and whooping-cough 1. Bight of the total deaths occurred in public hospitals. 34 certificates of infectious diseases were received, viz., scarlet fever 26, diphtheria 4, enteric fever 1, and erysipelas 3.

The 29 births were equal to a birth-rate of 37.1 per 1,000, and the eight deaths corresponded to an annual death-rate of 10.4 per 1,000. There was only one zymotic death (infantile diarrhoea), equal to a rate of 1.3 per 1,000; one of the total deaths occurred in hospital. 23 certificates of infectious diseases were received, viz., scarlet fever 22 and enteric fever 1. The Trustees of the Peabody Donation Fund, in their 32nd Annual Report for the year 1896, state that the net gain of the year from rents and interest has been £28,787 4s. 1d. The capital expenditure on land and buildings to the end of the year was £1,250,390 10s. 8d. At the end of the year the Trustees had provided for the artizan and labouring poor of London 11,367 rooms, besides bathrooms, laundries and lavatories. These rooms comprised 5,121 separate dwellings, viz., 83 of four rooms, 85 1,784 of three rooms, 2,429 of two rooms, and 825 of one room. The average weekly earnings of the head of each family in residence at the close of the year was £1 3s. 5fd. The average rent of each dwelling was 4s. 9½d. a week, and of each room 2s. 2d. The rent in all cases includes the free use of water, laundries, sculleries, and bath rooms. The number of persons in residence on 31st December last was 19,854, showing a mean density of 725 people to the acre, or nearly 13 times that of London. The birth-rate for the year reached 35.5 per 1,000, which is 5.3 per 1,000 above that of all London for the same period. The death-rate, including the deaths of 48 inhabitants of the buildings who were removed to hospitals, was 15.6 per 1,000, which is 3.0 per 1,000 below the average of London. The infant mortality was 120.2 in each 1,000 births, or 40.7 below that of London. 2.—Buildings belonging to the Incorporated Society for Improving the Condition of the Working Classes.

There were two deaths of young children from whooping-cough and diarrhoea, these corresponded to an annual zymotic death-rate of 9.3 per 1,000. Only one certificate of infectious diseases was received, viz., that of a child suffering from scarlet fever. Deaths in Certain Classes of Diseases. Class 1.—Specific, Febrile, or Zymotic Diseases. This class of diseases, called "zymotic," comprises in the Registrar-General's arrangement of the causes of death, six orders. The first and second orders (miasmatic and diarrhoeal) include the diseases which the RegistrarGeneral describes as the seven principal diseases of the zymotic class; the term "fever" includes "typhus," "enteric, or typhoid," and "simple continued forms of fever," these seven diseases being considered more or less of a preventable character. In England and Wales the deaths from these diseases during 1896 were 66,936, corresponding to a rate of 2.18 per 1,000 living, against 1.81 and 2.17 respectively in the preceding two years. In Registration London these diseases caused 14,009 deaths, equal to a zymotic death-rate of 3.11 per 1,000. In St. Giles district there were 87 deaths, equal to a rate of 2.2 per 1,000, against 2.0, 2.0, and 1.9, in the three preceding years; this rate was 1.9 per 1,000 below that of all London. 88 MIASMATIC ORDER. 1.—Small-Pox (decennial average, 0.7 per 1,000). It is satisfactory to note the absence of small-pox from the district throughout the year. No case has been reported since August, 1895. The 9 fatal cases of small-pox registered in London last year showed a farther decline from the number recorded in the three preceding years. During the year under notice 236 cases of small-pox were admitted into the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals. It will be convenient to insert here the following extracts from the Report of the Royal Commission on Vaccination. Vaccination. In May, 1889, a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the subject of Vaccination. During the seven years the Commission has lasted 136 meetings were held, 187 witnesses examined, and important investigations were conducted for their assistance. The final report of the Commission was presented to both Houses of Parliament on 13th of August last. The various questions submitted to the Commissioners are set forth under the headings A, B, C, D, and E. The conclusions and suggestions arrived at by the Commissioners are shown in the numbered paragraphs from the Report. 89 (A.)—As to the effect of Vaccination in reducing the prevalence of and mortality from Smallpox. (Par. 377.) The unanimous conclusion of the Commission on the Efficacy of Vaccination is that it has a protective effect in relation to small-pox, as we think:— 1. That it diminishes the liability to be attacked by the disease. 2. That it modifies the character of the disease and renders it (a) less fatal, and (b) of a milder or less severe type. 3. That the protection it affords against attacks of the disease is greatest during the years immediately succeeding the operation of vaccination. It is impossible to fix with precision the length of this period of highest protection. Though not in all cases the same, if a period is to be fixed it might, we think, fairly be said to cover in general a period of nine or ten years. 4. That after the lapse of the period of the highest protective potency the efficacy of vaccination to protect against attack rapidly diminishes, but that it is still considerable in the next quinquennium, and possibly never altogether ceases. 5. That its power to modify the character of the disease is also greatest in the period in which its power to protect from attack is greatest, but that its power thus to modify the disease does not diminish as rapidly as its protective influence against attacks, and its efficacy during the later periods of life to modify the disease is still very considerable. 6. That re-vaccination restores the protection which lapse of time has diminished, but the evidence shows that this protection again diminishes, and that, to ensure the highest degree of protection which vaccination can give, the operation should be at intervals repeated. 7. That the beneficial effects of vaccination are most experienced by those in whose case it has been most thorough. We think it may fairly be concluded that where the vaccine matter is inserted in three or four places it is more effectual than when introduced into one or two places only, and that if the vaccination marks are of an area of half a square inch they indicate a better state of protection than if their area be at all considerably below this. (B.)—As to objections made to Vaccination on the ground of injurious effects alleged to result therefrom, and the nature and extent of any injurious effects which do in fact so result. (Par. 434.) The conclusion was:—That although some of the dangers said to attend vaccination are undoubtedly real and not inconsiderable in gross amount, yet when considered in relation to the extent of 90 vaccination work done they are insignificant. There is reason further to believe that they are diminishing under the better precautions of the present day, and, with the addition of the further precautions which experience suggests, will do still more in the future. (C.)—As to whether any and, if so, what means should be adopted for preventing or lessening the ill effects, if any, resulting from Vaccination, and whether, and if so by what means, Vaccination with animal vaccine should be further facilitated as apart of public Vaccination. (Par. 437.) We think, therefore, that parents should not be required to submit their children to vaccination by means of any but calf lymph, but this should not preclude the use of humanised lymph in case they so desire. (Par. 438.) We have come to the conclusion that it would be well, at all events, to extend the age within which vaccination is obligatory to from three months to six months from the date of birth. (Par. 441.) Our attention has been called to the fact that in some workhouse infirmaries and lying-in hospitals it has been the practice to vaccinate children within a few days of their birth. Although under favourable conditions vaccination may be successfully carried out at that early age, we think the practice is to be deprecated unless there be at the time obvious danger of small-pox contagion. (Par. 443.) That some cases of disease contracted through vaccination might be avoided if the operation were performed at the child's home, instead of at a public vaccination station. (In Scotland vaccination is domiciliary rather than stational as it is at present in this country.) (Par. 449.) Another precaution which ought to be insisted upon is that no instrument should be used for the operation which has not been boiled or otherwise sterilised for the purpose, and that the simpler the instrument employed the better. (D.)—As to what means, other than Vaccination, can be used for diminishing the prevalence of Smallpox, and how far such means could be relied on in place of Vaccination. (Par. 557.)—1. That common shelters, which are not now subject to the law relating to common lodging-houses, should be made subject to such law. 2. That there should be power to the Local Authority to require medical examination of all persons entering common lodging-houses and casual wards, to see if they are suffering from smallpox, and to offer a reward for prompt information of the presence of the disease. 91 3. That the Local Authority should have power to order the keeper of a common lodging-house in which there has been smallpox to refuse fresh admissions for such time as may be required by the Authority. 4. That the Local Authority should be empowered to require the temporary closing of any common lodging-house in which smallpox has occurred. 5. That the Local Authority should have power to offer free lodgings to any inmate of a common lodging-house or casual ward who may reasonably be expected of being liable to convey smallpox. 6. That the Sanitary Authority should give notice to all adjoining Sanitary Authorities of the occurrence of smallpox in common lodginghouses or casual wards. 7. That where the disease occurs, the Public Vaccinator, or the Medical Officer of Health, should attend and vaccinate the inmates of such lodging-houses or wards, except such as should be unwilling to submit themselves to the operation. (Par. 508.) We may advert to the suggestion that the "Vaccination and the Sanitary Authority should in all cases be identical It is contended that sanitation and vaccination, concerning as they do both the health of the people, should be under the jurisdiction of a single authority, and that the Sanitary Authority is the appropriate one for that purpose. Indeed, the advantage of placing in the same hands the supervision of vaccination and of the other measures designed to prevent the spread of disease are so great and so obvious that the proposal to do so deserves most serious consideration. . . . We should regard with favour such changes as would render the amalgamation of the Vaccination and Sanitary Authorities feasible. This recommendation endorses the resolution which was carried at the conference of Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis held at St. Pancras Vestry Hall on the 25th June last. "That in the opinion of this conference of delegates of the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards the Vaccination Acts should be administered by the Authorities that administer the Acts and provisions for the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases by notification, isolation, and disinfection." (E.)-As to whether any alteration should be made in the arrangements and proceedings for securing the performance of Vaccination, and in particular in those provisions of the Vaccination Acts with respect to prosecutions for non-compliance with the law. 92 The Commission in a fifth interim report advised that the practice of repeated prosecutions and the' infliction of multiple penalties should cease. Two of the Medical Members of the Commission do not find themselves able to go so far in recommending relaxation of the law as is implied in paragraphs 524, 525, 526, and 527. They think that in all cases in which a parent or guardian refuses to allow vaccination, the person so refusing should be summoned before a Magistrate, as at present, and that the only change made should be to permit the Magistrate to accept a sworn deposition of conscientious objection, and to abstain from the infliction of a fine. Table 13 (Appendix) is a return respecting vaccination in the St. Giles District during 1895, kindly supplied to me by the Vaccination Officer of the Guardians. 2.—Measles (decennial average 26.5 per 1,000). The deaths from it in 1896 were considerably above the average. Of the total 83 zymotic deaths of children, 41, or nearly one-half, were from measles, against 7 from scarlet fever and 5 from diphtheria. Unfortunately measles is not regarded by parents as a serious disease, and in but a comparatively few cases a doctor is called in, often too late to save the life of the patient. The Lancet comments in the following annotation, headed "Infanticide by Measles in England and Scotland":—"The mortality from measles has proportions that call for more attention from Sanitary Authorities than 93 it receives. There is this most significant difference between this mortality in different classes of the community. In the better sort of practice the mortality from measles is almost nil. Some practitioners with well-to-do patients have possibly never seen a fatal case of measles in their practice, though the disease is often pyrexial; but the number of deaths from it now in the large towns of England and Wales and of Scotland exceeds greatly the number from scarlet fever or diphtheria, or from both of these put together. This mortality has been described lately by writers in the Nineteenth Century as a form of murder." In October last your Board addressed a further communication to the Local Government Board, urging that an early decision should be given to their proposal that measles should be included in the list of notifiable diseases. 3.—Scarlet Fever (decennial average 6.3 per 1,000). The 7 deaths, all young children under 5, in 1896, were slightly above the average, and occurred in public institutions outside the district, viz.:— 1 death at Homerton Fever Hospital. 2 deaths at the North-Western Fever Hospital. 4 deaths at the Western Fever Hospital. The total number of cases notified in 1896 was 180; of these 153 were removed to hospital for treatment. 4.—Diphtheria (decennial average 14.2). The 5 deaths of young children under 5 years were 9.2 below the decennial average; 2 of the deaths occurred 94 after removal, viz., 1 at Charing Cross Hospital and 1 at the North-Western Fever Hospital. The total notifications were 56; of these 45 were treated at the several hospitals. The Registrar-General, in his annual summary for 1896, states:—"Among London sanitary areas the lowest death-rates from diphtheria, after distribution of institution deaths, were 0.09 in St. James, Westminster, 0.12 in Strand, 0.18 in St. Giles, and 0.21 in Wandsworth." The Report of the Medical Superintendents of the Metropolitan Asylums Board upon the use of anti-toxic serum in the treatment of diphtheria in the hospitals of the Board during 1896, gives the following improved results:— 1.—A great reduction in the mortality of cases brought under treatment on the first three days of illness. 2.—The lowering of the combined general mortality to a point below that of any former year. 3.—The still more remarkable reduction in the mortality of laryngeal cases. 4.—The uniform improvement in the results of tracheotomy at each separate hospital. 5.—The beneficial effect produced on the clinical course of the disease. 5.—Whooping-Cough (decennial average 19.7). There were 13 deaths from this disease. These were all infantile and below the average. 6.—Continued Fevers (decennial average 7.6). Again no case was recorded from either typhus or simple continued forms of fever. 95 The 3 deaths were from enteric or typhoid, and occurred at adult ages. There were 21 notifications, and 16 removals to hospitals, where three died. DIARRHCEAL ORDER. 7.—Diarrhcea (decennial average 22.5). 14 infants died under 1 year, and 3 between 1 and 5 years, a total of 17 children's deaths; as usual, the heaviest of this mortality occurred during the summer and autumn months. Cholera. At different times during the year Russia, Austria, Constantinople, Egypt, the Levant, and other places were affected by Asiatic cholera. On the 15th January a steamship from the Black Sea came into Holyhead under stress of weather, reporting during the voyage that ten cases of so-called diarrhoea had occurred, besides three fatal cases of undoubted Asiatic cholera. The Local Health authorities adopted the necessary precautions, and no case of the disease was imported into this country. In July I received a communication from the London County Council informing me that Dr. Klein, as in former years, was prepared to examine bacteriologically material from any case of suspected Asiatic cholera which might occur in the Metropolis. The Medical Officer of the Local Government Board reproduces in his annual report, on account of their significance four conclusions which were arrived at by Dr. 96 Barry after his investigation into the outbreaks of cholera in the Bast and in Europe during 1893:— 1st.—This diffusion of cholera from one place or country to another has invariably followed lines of human intercourse. 2nd.—Increased facilities for steam communication by land and by water, especially between Central Asia and Europe, have conduced to a rapidity in the diffusion of cholera hitherto unprecedented. 3rd.—Cholera in its progress by way of river traffic has fastened on more centres of population than when its diffusion has taken place overland. 4th.—All "explosions" of cholera as to which detailed evidence has been forthcoming, have been found on investigation to have been referable to specifically polluted water supplies. Notification of Infectious Diseases. In St. Giles District 375 certificates, of which 30 were duplicates, were received from Medical Practitioners under the 55th Section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, viz.:— Scarlet fever 180 and 10 duplicates. Diphtheria 56 „ 5 duplicates. Enteric fever 21 „ 4 duplicates. Membranous croup 4 Puerperal fever 1 Erysipelas 83 and 11 duplicates. In all London the total notifications were 49,699. Removals to Hospitals. The admission of patients from the St. Giles District to the several hospitals of the Asylums' Board was as follows:— Scarlet fever 153 Diphtheria 45 Enteric fever 16 CHART SHOWING WEEK BY WEEK THE NUMBER OF CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE Notified by Medical Practitioners as having occurred in the St. Giles District during 1896. 97 Erysipelas (38) were removed from St. Giles Workhouse to the Central London Sick Asylum, Cleveland Street. Disinfection of Infected Premises. 221 rooms were disinfected after the following infectious diseases:— Scarlet fever 149 Diphtheria 52 Enteric fever 19 Puerperal fever 1 Disinfection of Bedding, Clothing, &c. The following articles were brought to the Stone Yard and disinfected in the Washington Lyon's Steam apparatus:— Articles. Number Articles. Number Articles.

By order of your Board the disinfectants used for the following purposes are:— 1. Chloride of Lime, containing not less than 30 per cent, of chlorine, for disinfecting the soil and refuse matter removed from the catch-pit gullies and sewers and house drains. 2. Sanitas Powder and Fluid, for use in the mortuary and post-mortem room. 3. Permanganate of Potash (crystals), in street-watering and flushing of courts and alleys. 4. Perchloride of Mercury, for the disinfection of drains sewers, and gully-pits. A. mixture of this is made in the proportions of— Perchloride of mercury 8 ounces (3,500 grains). Methylated spirit 2 pints. Aniline (green) half an ounce. Water to make 50 gallons. 5. Tnson's Liquid Disinfectant, for the underground conveniences. 6. Kuna Pine, for use in the mortuary and post-mortem room. 7. Carbolic Acid (pale), containing not less than 95 per cent.of available carbolic acid, for disinfecting urinals. 8. Carbolic Acid (prepared), soluble in water containing not less than 25 per cent. of available carbolic acid. (This is not used as a disinfectant, but only for tracing drains.) 9. Carbolic Acid Disinfecting Powder, containing not 99 less than 15 per cent.of available carbolic acid for deodorising dust-bins. 10. Carbolic Acid Crystals, free from staining properties and corrosive matter, for use in the underground conveniences. II.— Constitutional Diseases Caused 200 deaths. This important class of diseases includes cancer, phthisis, mesenteric disease, and other forms of tuberculosis. Of these diseases consumption next to bronchitis caused the greatest fatality during the year. Phthisis (tuberculosis of the lungs, consumption, or decline) is an infectious disease due to the invasion of the body by the bacillus tuberculosis, first discovered by Koch. Many other diseases included amongst the tubercular group are supposed to be caused by the same bacillus. The subject of tuberculosis has been brought prominently before the public by the issue of the Report of the Royal Commission on "The Effect of Food derived from Tuberculous Animal on Human Health." An eminent authority gives as his opinion "that of the total deaths under ten years of age, about a third are due to tuberculosis, and that the usual seat of disease at that age points to food as the medium of infection." Amongst the most important precautions suggested for the prevention of the continued propagation of tubercular disease are:— The clearing of insanitary areas and the provision of clean, well-ventilated houses built on dry sites. 100 2. Equal administration all over the country to be taken (a) to ensure the improvement of cowsheds, (b) the systematic inspection of milch cows, and (c) to prevent the distribution of milk from tuberculous cows. 3. To prevent the consumption of tuberculous meat. At the meeting of the British Medical Association at Carlisle in August last the following resolution was carried unanimously:— "This Section (Medicine) is of opinion that the Council of the Association should take an early opportunity of impressing upon the Government and Public Authorities, having regard to the facts now fully established and recognised by the Medical Profession, that tuberculosis is an infective disease and capable of being controlled by special measures that in order to produce any beneficial results on an appreciable scale it is necessary:— "1. That provision should be made at the public expense for bacteriological laboratories by all the Sanitary Authorities where the sputum from patients expected to be tuberculous can be examined and reported upon. "2. That on the discovery of pulmonary phthisis in any individual of the poorer classes, provision should be made for the treatment of such cases in a public institution provided for the purpose at the public expense and by voluntary contributions." III.—Local Diseases. The diseases in this class, which comprises eleven orders, were accountable for 375 deaths, nearly one-half of the total number registered during the year; the diseases which caused the greatest fatality were those which affected the heart (77) and the air passages (142). 101 IV.—Sudden and Violent Deaths.

Thirty of the deaths occurred from different forms of violence, of these 23 were from accidents. The following are among the causes of death returned by the Coroner:— A doctor of medicine (a professional embalmer) died from an overdose of chlorodyne. 102 A girl whilst cleaning windows, fell into the street, fracturing her skull. An actor was fatally stabbed on the stage with a dagger, wounding the aorta. A flyman was accidently killed at a theatre by falling off a ladder. A time-keeper died from a bullet-wound. "Wilful murder against a fellow workman. A female, aged 27, died from the effects of an illegal operation. Wilful murder against some person unknown. A female, aged 12, died from accidental injury to leg by violence when in a crowd. 3 persons were knocked down and killed by street cabs. 7 infants were suffocated in bed with their parents. The Public Mortuary, Goldsmith Street. Daring the year 64 bodies were received, including 7 of non-parishioners, who were brought in for inquest purposes. Post-mortem examinations were made in 39 cases. The total number of bodies received since the opening of the building in 1883 is 1,070. 103 Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.

Regulations for Houses Let in Lodgings or occupied by more than one family. (Section 94.) The Regulations made by your Board and approved by the Local Government Board in 1887, as to houses let in lodgings or occupied by more than one family, continue to be enforced in the District. These Regulations do not apply to common lodging- 104 houses within the Common Lodging Houses Act, 1851, or any Act amending the same. The following 523 houses in the St. Giles District are registered under these regulations. Locality. No. of Houses. Locality. No. of Houses.

From a report received from the Medical Officer of the London County Council, it appears that these regulations are adopted in 31 of the 40 London Sanitary Districts, and that in some nine of these, including St. Giles, a considerable number of houses had been registered. Common Lodging Houses Acts, 1851 and 1853. The Secretary of State, by a Provisional Order which came into operation 1st November, 1894, transferred to the London County Council the powers of the Commissioner 105 of Metropolitan Police in respect of Common LodgingHouses.

Your Clerk and myself, as your appointed delegates, attended the Congress of the British Institute of Public Health, held at Glasgow from the 22nd to the 28th July last. At the opening meeting the Hon. the Lord Provost of Glasgow", the President of the Congress, delivered his address on the "Sanitary History of Glasgow." At subsequent meetings addresses were given— (a) In the Chemistry and Engineering Section, by Professor Ramsay, Ph.D., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in University College, London, on "Sunlight as a Purifier." (b) In the Municipal and Parliamentary Section, by Robert Crawford, Esq., Chairman of the Glasgow Health Committee on "The Progress that had been made in Glasgow in everything conducive to the Improvement in Public Health." (c) In the Preventive Medicine Section, by Dr. Russell, LL.D., Chief Medical Officer of Health, Glasgow, on "Infection." In addition to the Presidential Addresses, papers were read and discussed on "Peaty Water in a Reservoir," " Smoke Prevention," "Ventilation," "Chemical Sanitation," " American Meat Inspection," " Housing of the Poor," " Health and Morals in relation to the Housing of Poor Children," "Disposal of City Refuse," "On Elementary Schools and Diphtheria," "Poisoning by Decayed Meat," "Enteric Fever," "Ice Cream Vendors," "House 107 Drainage," "Sanitary Certification of all Houses before Occupation," "Disinfection," "Return Cases of Scarlet Fever," "Inter-notification of Disease," "Rural Water Supplies," &c., &c. At the concluding meeting the Presidents of the Sections presented the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted:— Preventive Medicine Section. That in the opinion of this Congress the cremation of the dead, especially in the case of infectious disease, is a rational and veryhygienic process, and the Congress urge upon the British Institute of Public Health to use all proper means of urging upon the Government the desirability of promoting a measure enabling sanitary authorities, if they so desire, to build Crematoria, and conduct them under proper supervision. Municipal and Parliamentary Section. 1. That the information put before this Section shows that the undoubted emission of smoke from chimneys of mills and factories, large hotels and other buildings, and from steamboats, can be prevented by careful firing or mechanical stokers, and without causing extra expenditure to the owners; it is desirable that the authorities of Glasgow, and other districts generally, should enforce the Smoke Prevention clause of their Local Act more stringently than they have hitherto done. 2. That it be a representation from the Congress of the British Institute of Public Health to Her Majesty's Government that facilities be afforded to Local Authorities to apply tests for the detection of tuberculosis in cattle within their jurisdiction. 3. That a representation from this Congress be made to Her Majesty's Government in favour of the early introduction of legislation with the object of rendering it compulsory upon Local Authorities to provide central or district abattoirs, these being, in the opinion of the Congress, indispensable for the proper supervision and inspection of meat supply. Sanitary Work. In Table 6, Appendix, there will be found a summary of the work carried out during the year by the Sanitary 108 Inspectors under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Factory and "Workshops Acts, 1878 to 1891. Inspections and Orders. Inspectors Bond and Robinson made 11,445 visits and inspections, which resulted in the serving of 1,154 orders upon owners for the abatement of various kinds of nuisances, and the sanitary amendment of houses and premises. Proceedings at Bow Street Police Court. In 26 cases where your Board's orders were not complied with the owners were summoned to the Police Court, where convictions were obtained in every instance. Overcrowding. In 22 cases where the Sanitary Inspectors found overcrowding in rooms, orders were immediately served upon the owners to reduce the number of inmates occupying them. Underground Sleeping Rooms. Ten underground kitchens or sleeping rooms were vacated as soon as the necessary orders were served for their closure. Upon a report being received that the front kitchens of Nos. 5a, 6, 7, and 8, Little Russell Street were illegally occupied, I carefully inspected them, and found that though they did not comply with the measurements required by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, they 109 were in other respects in excellent habitable condition, and having regard to the house accommodation in the district, and to the sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and other circumstances, your Clerk and myself recommended the Sanitary Committee to dispense with the strict compliance with the Act, upon the application to your Board of the several owners of the rooms. Factories, Workshops, and Workplaces. 109 visits were made to factories and workshops, and orders made upon owners for limewhiting, cleansing and purifying their several workplaces. Special attention was given to the 38th section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which enacts that where persons of both sexes are employed or in attendance, proper separate w.c. accommodation must be provided for persons of each sex. Animals Improperly Kept. Four goats and dogs found to be improperly kept in rooms and premises were ordered to be removed. Unsound Food. 336 tins of decomposed potted lobster and several parcels of fish were brought to the Stone Yard and destroyed. Bakehouses. (Sect. 26.) There are 27 bakehouses in the district; 14 in the 110 parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and 13 in St. George, Bloomsbury. The * marks those which are underground. ST. GILES-IN-THE-FIELDS. Premises.

At a special meeting of the Public Health and Housing Committee of the London County Council, held on the 26th October, 1896, the following licenses were renewed for slaughter-houses:— Locality. Licensee. No. 6, Drury Lane Mr. C. Shortlands. No. 23, Store Street Mr. Wm. Kingmill. Your Sanitary Committee again previous to the licensing day visited the several premises, and forwarded to the London County Council a resolution "that they are of the same opinion as in former years, viz., that the Council should refuse to renew the licences for slaughterhouses, as the Committee are of opinion that slaughterhouses should not exist in crowded districts in the Metropolis." Cow-House. At the same meeting of the Committee of the London County Council the licence was renewed for the undermentioned Cow-shed:— Locality. Licensee. Dimensions of Shed. No. of Cows Allowed. No. of Cows now in Shed. No. 4, Goldsmith Street Mr. Edward Jones 7,246 cubic feet. 9 4 Marine Stores. Notwithstanding that the rag and bone shops in the District are regularly inspected, frequent complaints are 112 received of the offensive smells in some of them from the storeage of decayed animal matter. A "marine store" is not scheduled in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as an offensive trade, consequently no bye-laws have been made for the conduct of the business. It is to be desired that the County Council should add it to the list. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S. R. LOYBTT, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh; Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland; Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, London ; Vice-President (Past President) of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health; Fellow and Member of Council, of the British Institute of Public Health; Medical Officer of Health for Lincoln's Inn; Medical Officer of Health for the District. 113 APPENDIX.
