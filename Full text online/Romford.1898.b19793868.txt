Removed to Hospital 9 The following is a succinct account of the different infectious diseases requiring notice from your sanitary officials during the year. My practice is to request the Sanitary Inspector to visit each house as soon as I receive a notification of the existence of infectious disease there, visiting myself, subsequently, all those cases which I consider require it. Small Pox.—No case during the year. Scarlet Fever.—Forty-six cases of this disease were notified from various parts of the district—the localities where it prevailed being, in the order of the number of cases, as under:— Squirrels Heath and Neighbourhood 19 Hornchurch „ „ 10 Dagenham „ „ 7 Havering „ „ 4 Rainham and Wennington 2 Upminster and Neighbourhood 2 Collier Row 1 Great Warley 1 46 The disease was not epidemic in any locality, although at Squirrels Heath, owing to personal infection, several adjacent families became affected. Diphtheria.—Thirty-seven cafes occurred in the localities specified as under:— Dagenham 7 Romford (Extra Urban) 1 Collier Row 3 Squirrels Heath 1 Hornchurch 7 Great Warley 5 Rainham and Wennington 5 Upminster and Corbets Tey 8 37 10 Most of these were associated with local sewage nuisance, in Dagenham, the old condition so often reported; in Corbets Tey, a local nuisance caused by defects, subsequently remedied. Typhoid.—Thirty-five cases of Typhoid Fever occurred in the district as under : — Dagenham and Beacontree Heath 23 Chadwell Heath 1 Hornchurch 3 Upminster and Cranham 3 Rainham 2 Great Warley 1 Romford (Extra Urban) 2 35 It will be seen that a large proportion of these cases occurred in Dagenham and Beacontree Heath, localities where local nuisances from sewage pollution are very general. Special reports were made to you on various occasions on this subject. Some few of these cases were removed to the Barking or the Ilford Isolation Hospital. Measles prevailed to a very considerable extent over the whole of the district, not being a notifiable disease, I am unable to report more than that it was very generally prevalent. It caused seven deaths. Luckily the weather was mild during the greater time the disease prevailed, or the mortality would, undoubtedly, have been very much greater. II.—An account of the Sanitary condition of the District generally, at the end of 1898. In complying with this section of the Local Government Board's instructions to Medical Officers of Health I proceed to give, as in previous years, a short account of the sanitaiy state of the district under the same heads of localities as are given in the statistical tables. 11 Dagenham, Beacontree Heath, and Chadwell Heath.— Villages and scattered groups of houses, all situated in the parish of Dagenham, and occupying a very wide area, standing on gravel and on London clay, some (part of Dagenham village and immediate neighbourhood) on alluvium. Estimated population, 5,020. Agricultural. Water supply mainly from South Essex Company. The village of Dagenham is in a bad Sanitary condition, owing to the ground being saturated by years' overflowing cesspools and slop-water. Most of the cottages supplied with pail closets, emptied once a week by the Sanitary Authority. A system of scavenging is now in force, the owners of cottages having been called upon by the Sanitary Authority to provide dust-bins, which are periodically emptied by the Authority. There still exists, though, a condition of soil sodden by sewage overflow from cesspools, and which nothing but some system of drainage will relieve, and until this is done, the village must continue to be in a bad Sanitary condition. The system recommended by me, and at one time all but sanctioned by the Sanitary Authority, was, I believe, frustrated by the short-sighted opposition of the Parish Councilin 189(5. Birth-rate, 31.8. Death-rate, 16.5. Death-rate from zymotic disease, 1.1 per 1,000 of the population. Collier Row stands on the London clay. Estimated population 860. Scattered houses and groups of houses. Privies. Water-supply partly from wells and partly from South Essex Company; some portion badly supplied, owing to the distance of the dwellings from the mains. Local nuisances from sewage overflowing from cesspits, &c., into ditches, requiring frequent interference from the Sanitary Inspector. Birth-rate, 36.04. Death-rate, 17.4. Death-rate from zymotic disease, 1.1. N.B.—It is impossible to gauge the sanitary condition of sparselypopulated localities such as this by the death-rate, the occurrence of a few casual deaths apparently and erroneously giving a large rate of mortality for the small population. Havering stands high on pebble sand, bounded by London and boulder clay. Population 500. Agricultural. Privies. Watersupply from wells and from South Essex Company. Some of the out-lying parts of the parish badly supplied, the source in these 12 localities being mainly from ponds, which in some instances, are decidedly unfit for use. Birth-rate, 26.0. Death-rate, 10.0. Deathrate from zymotic disease, nil. Noak Hill, Romford Common, and Squirrels Heath.— Estimated population, 1,300. Noak Hill stands high on London and boulder clay. A small scattered hamlet. Agricultural. Privies. Water supply from wells. Romford Common and Squirrels Heath stands less high, partly on London clay and partly on gravel. Agricultural, and railway employees at Great Eastern Railway Provender and Tarpaulin Factory. Privies and cesspools. Water supply, mostly good, from South Essex Company. Romford Common is badly supplied, the water-bearing strata (as in the adjoining district of Havering), being said to be difficult to tap. Birth-rate, 30.0. Death-rate, 12.3. Death-rate from zymotic disease, 0.7. Hornchurch.—Large village, and scattered groups of houses extending over a large parochial area. Part of the parish adjoining the town of Romford, and really constituting a portion of that town. Stands mostly on gravel and partly on London clay, some small portion of the parish running down to the Thames, and alluvial. Population, 4,700, principally agricultural, foundry works, and a brewery in the village. A large bicycle manufactory, employing about 100 men and boys, near the village. No system of scavenging. A good part of the village supplied with pail closets, other houses drain into cesspools, many of which overflow into ditches, and, with the brewery, pollute the neighbouring stream to a considerable extent. That portion of the parish of Hornchurch running into the town of Romford, which was in an extremely unsatisfactory condition as regards its sewage removal, cesspools overflowing, and ditches full of stagnant filth frequently causing interference from the Sanitary Inspector, has been vastly improved by the system of sewerage recently completed. Birth-rate, 27.8. Death-rate, 12.9. Death-rate from zymotic disease, 0.6. Upminster, Cranham, and Corhets Tey.—Adjacent villages, standing on high ground, mostly brick earth, some gravel. Population 1,990. Agricultural. Privies and cesspools. Some few of the latter polluting roadside ditches. Water supply, mostly from South 13 Essex Company. Some wells. Birth-rate, 21.6. Death-rate, 15.5. Death-rate from zymotic disease, 21. A system of sewerage for the locality in course of adoption. Great Warlfey stands high on London clay. The most thicklypopulated part of the parish joins the town of Brentwood, in the Billericay Union, the larger area of the parish having scattered houses and groups of houses. Population 1,890. Agricultural. A system of sewerage has been recently adopted for the populous portion of this locality, the sewage being taken at a distance and treated on the septic principle of purification. This, so far, is a great success, there is not the least nuisance in the locality of the Sewage Works, and the effluent after running over land in furrows is perfectly clear and inodorous. Water supply for the locality mainly from the South Essex Works, some wells. The more sparsely-populated rural part of the locality is badly supplied, ponds being a main source of supply in some parts. Birth-rate, 32.8. Death-rate, 11.05. Deathrate from zymotic disease, 2.5. Rainham and Wennington lie low on gravel and alluvium at the edge of the Thames. Marshy. Village of 2,300 inhabitants. Agricultural and river traffic. Tidal stream runs through Rainham to the Thames, about one mile distant. No system of sewage removal or scavenging. Privies and cesspools. Foul state of atmosphere frequent from factories on river bank (manure, candles, glue, &c.), some on the Essex, most on the Kent side of the river. Water swpply mostly from South Essex Company, some wells, some of which are polluted. Birth-rate, 313. Death-rate, 7.3. Death-rate from zymotic disease, 0.8. III.—An account of the enquiries as to the conditions injurious to health existing in the district, and of the proceedings relating to such conditions in which advice has hern given, &c., &c. In addition to the cases of infectious diseases recorded in Section I. of this report, the following insanitary conditions, &c., necessitating official interference by the Sanitary Inspector, who called in my 14 assistance when it was deemed necessary. These instances of nuisances are included in the list detailed in a later part of this report.

The following is a complete list of the insanitary conditions, respecting which notices have been served by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year.

Whilst congratulating the Council upon the many Sanitary Improvements that they have effected in the district in recent years, there are still many to effect, and chiefly amongst them I class the following:— 1.—A system of sewerage for the Villages of Dagenham, for Beacontree Heath, for Rainham, for Hornchurch, and Harold Wood. 2.—Scavenging arrangements for the more populous localities. 26 I am sanguine that the Isolation Hospital now, I am pleased to say, in a fair way of being established, will be the means of checking very considerably the spread of infectious diseases.

The birth and death rates of the different localities forming the Romford Rural District, as shown in the following table, the rates for the past five years being shown side by side, by way of comparison.
