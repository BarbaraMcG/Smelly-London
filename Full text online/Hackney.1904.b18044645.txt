MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1904. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Hackney. Gentlemen, I beg herewith to present my Thirteenth Annual Report on the Public Health of the Borough of Hackney. The past year cannot, from a public health point of view, be regarded as being quite so satisfactory as the year 1903. While no very wide-spread or serious incidence of infectious disease occurred in the borough during that year, the number of such cases exceeded largely that of the previous year. "While only 1,850 cases were notified in 1903, the number reached 2,426 during 1904. The general mortality also reached a higher figure last year than in 1903, the mortality rates being 16.05 per 1,000 in 1904 against 14.1 per 1,000 in 1903. The death-rate from infectious disease was also higher, viz. 2.3 per 1,000 against 1.9 per 1,000 in 1903. The cause of the increased general mortality during 1904 is to be found, no doubt, in the increased heat and dryness of the summer months of last year, the mean temperature being 63.1, and the 6 rainfall amounting to only 4½ inches during the third quarter of the Year. During these months there was consequently a great increase in the infant deaths, due to epidemic diarrhoea. Comparing the chart of 1904, showing the notification of infections with that of 190.", it will be seen that the increase of infectious disease during the former year occurred under the heads of chicken-pox and scarlet fever, the latter being of course more serious than the former. In spite of the unfavourable conditions noted, the past year may be regarded, from a public health point of view, as satisfactory. I am pleased to add that the several officers of the Public Health Department have during the past year, on the whole, carried out the duties allotted to them to my entire satisfaction. Population and Density.—The population of the Borough of Hackney at the end of June, 1904, I estimate to be 225,663, the density 68.5 per acre. The following table gives the respective estimated populations and density for the various sub-districts of the borough:— Table.

The annual rate of persons married in the population of Hackney is, therefore, 15-1 per 1,000. The marriage-rate for London during the same * I have here to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Tom Hosgood, Superintendent Registrar, who has kindly abstracted for me the number of marriages and illegitimate births for the year 1904. 7 period is 17.0 persons married per 1,000 of estimated population. The following table gives the marriage-rates for Hackney and London for the 10 years ending 1895-1904:— Year. Borough of Hackney. London. Marriages. Marriage Rate.

This is equal to a birth-rate of nearly 27.7 per 1,000 living persons for the whole borough. This number of births shows a decline in comparison with the number in 1903 which was 6,180. The birth-rate for London for the same period is 27.9 per 1,000. 8 Table. Births. Registration District of Hackney. Registration Sub-Districts. All London.

Of this number 234 occurred in the Salvation Army Rescue Home, Mare Street, but 224 of these were of mothers drawn from places outside Hackney. Deducting these from the total illegitimate births registered, there remain 146 births to be credited to Hackney residents. This gives an illegitimate birth-rate of over 23 per 1,000 births. Deaths.—The total number of deaths registered in the Borough during 1904 was 3,537, but of these deaths 436 were persons belonging to other districts, but dying in institutions in Hackney. On the other hand, 372 Hackney residents died during the year in institutions outside the borough. Making the necessary corrections, the deaths belonging to the Borough amount to 3,473, which gives a corrected death-rate of 15.4 per 1,000. This rate requires a further correction for age and sex distribution, which is made by means of the factor 1.04264. Multiplying the corrected death-rate by this factor we obtain a mortality rate of 16.05 per 1,000 living persons. This rate is higher than that of 1903, which was 14.7 per 1,000. The increase is no doubt due to the hot summer of 1904, which caused a high infantile mortality during the third quarter of the year. The lowest death-rate is in the North Sub-District (12.8 per 1,000), and the highest in the South-East Sub-District (18.0 per 1,000). The annual death-rate from all causes for London in 1904 is 16.6 per 1,000 living. Sub-District. Populalation. No. of Births. Birthrate. Total Deaths. Deathrate. Deaths under 1 year.

This is equivalent to an infantile mortality of 155 per 1,000 births. This rate is considerably higher than that during 1903, the deaths in that year under one year of age having numbered 786, and the infantile mortality being 127 per 1,000 births. The increased infantile mortality during 1904 was undoubtedly due to the excessive heat of the summer months of the year. The infant mortality was lowest in the north sub.district and highest in the south.east sub.district. The infant mortality for London during 1904 is 146 per 1,000 births.

The annual mortality rate of persons at 65 years and upwards is 3.5 per 1,000 persons living. Deaths in Public Institutions.—There were 1,238 deaths in institutions within the Borough. Of these 802 were residents of Hackney, and 436 the residents of other districts. The following are the institutions within the Borough receiving persons both from and without the Borough, with the deaths in each during 1903. 12 INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE BOROUGH RECEIVING PERSONS BOTH FROM AND WITHOUT THE BOROUGH.

During the year ending 31st December, 1904, the notifications of infectious disease received numbered 2,429, but of these 59 were subsequently found not to be genuine cases, thus leaving a total of 2,375 cases for the year. This is equivalent to an attack rate of 105 per 1,000 of the population. The deaths from infectious disease, both notifiable and non notifiable, during the same period amounted to 523, which is equivalent to a mortality rate of 2.3 per 1,000 living persons. A. NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Small-Pox.—During the year 1904 there were 13 cases of small-pox notified in the borough, 5 of which were afterwards found not to be cases of that disease, thus leaving a total of 8 genuine cases of small-pox. No death from this disease was recorded during the year 1904 in Hackney. Scarlet Fever or Scarlatina.—The number of cases of this disease notified in the Borough during the year was 863, but of this number 14 were afterwards diagnosed not to be this disease; so that the total genuine cases notified during 1904 was 849. This is an increase of 213 30 upon the number notified during 1903, the total for the latter year having been 636. The attack rate for the year 1904 is, therefore, 3.7 per 1,000 living. The incidence of the disease remained low during the first eight months of the year, but in the month of September a sudden rise in the notifications took place, which reached its maximum in the first week of October. A rapid fall then took place, which was uninterrupted until the end of the year save by a rise in the last week of November. The number of notified cases of scarlet fever removed to hospital was 718, being equivalent to 84.5 per cent, of the cases. The following table shows the distribution of the disease in the different sub-districts of the Borough. Sub-districts. North. Central. South-East. South-West. No. of Cases of Scarlet Fever 239 230 165 215 Attack rate, per 1,000 4.3 4.5 2.7 3.4 It will be seen from this table that the disease was more prevalent in. the north and central sub-districts of the Borough. The deaths from scarlet fever numbered 19, being equivalent to a mortality rate of nearly 2.3 per 1,000 attacked and .08 per 1,000 persons living. The character of the disease during 1904 was remarkably mild. The number of cases of scarlet fever notified in the whole of London during 1904, was 13,439, and the death rate .08 per 1,000 living. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—There were 566 notifications of diphtheria and 6 of membranous croup received during 1904, but of the diphtheria cases 29 and of membranous croup 1 case were ultimately diagnosed as not being diphtheria. This leaves a total of 542 cases of diphtheria disease, giving an attack rate of 24 per 1,000 31 living persons. This is slightly above the rate for 1903 ; the rate for that year having been 2.3 per 1,000. Diphtheria was prevalent during the whole of 1004, but it must be stated much below the average of previous years. The following gives the number of cases notified and shows the prevalence of the disease in the different parts of the Borough. The valence of the disease in the different parts of the Borough. chart accompanying this report shows the changes in the prevalence of the disease during 1904. Sub-districts. North.

In no previous year has such a high proportion of cases been removed to hospital. From the above table it can be seen that the disease was more prevalent in the southern part of the Borough than elsewhere. The deaths from diphtheria and membranous croup during 1904 numbered 57. This is equal to a death rate of 10.5 per 1,000 persons attacked and a death rate of .25 per 1,000 persons living. The number of cases of diphtheria notified in London during 1904 was 7,219, and the number of deaths from this disease 729. This latter is equal to a death rate of' .16 per thousand living in London. During 1904 swabbing from the throats of patients suspected to be suffering fiom diphtheria were examined for diphtheria bacilli to 32 the number of 87. Diphtheria bacilli were found in 27 cases, but the examination of the remaining 60 yielded negative results. Typhoid or Enteric Fever.—During the year under consideration 185 cases of typhoid or enteric fever were notified in the district. Of these 10 were subsequently found not to be cases of that disease, thus leaving a total of 175 genuine cases. This gives an attack rate of .77 per 1,000 living. This is a considerable decline upon the number and rate for the previous year 1903, when the number notified was 247 and the attack rate was equal to l.l per 1,000 living. The incidence of the disease was very low during the first seven months of the year. A rise then took place in the second week of August, which was maintained, with slight fluctuations, until the first week iu October, when it fell to a point little above the average for the year. A slight rise occurred in the third week of November and the third week in December, after which the notifications gradually fell to zero. The following table shows the distribution of the cases in the four sub districts of the Borough, with the attack rate per 1,000 persons living. Sub-districts. North. Central. South-East. South-West. No. of Cases of Typhoid 33 33 64 45 Attack rate per 1,000 living •63 •62 1-07 •74 Of the total notified 141 were removed to hospital. This is equal to over 76 per cent, of the total. The deaths from this disease during the year numbered 25, which is equivalent to a mortality rate of 14.2 per cent, attacked and to .11 per 1,000 persons living. The number of cases of enteric fever notified in London during 1904 was 1896, and the death rate .06 per 1,000 living. 33 During the year 24 samples of blood from patients suspected to be suffering from typhoid fever were examined, and in 13 cases the blood was found to give the reaction known as "Widal's," indicating that in these cases typhoid was present. In the remainder the results were negative. Typhus.—No case of typhus was notified in Hackney during 1904. Continued Fever.—During the year three cases were notified under this name. There was one death ascribed to continued fever during the same period. Puerperal Fever.—The notifications of puerperal fever numbered 23 during 1904, of which 7 were removed to hospital. The deaths numbered 11, which is equal to a mortality rate of 47.7 per cent, on the number notified. The attack rate is 3.7 per 1,000 births and the mortality 1-7 per 1,000 births. Plague.—No case of this disease was notified in the Borough during 1904. Erysipelas.—There were 266 cases of this disease notified during the year, which is equivalent to an attack rate of l.l per 1,000 living. Of this number 69 were removed to hospital. This is equal to 25.9 per cent. Below is a table showing the distribution, with the attack rate, of the different sub-districts:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-East. South-West. No. of Cases of Erysipelas. 38 55 124 49 Rate per 1,000 living. •72 1-03 2-07 •80 The deaths numbered 11. This is equal to a mortality rate of 41 per 1,000 cases and .05 per 1,000 living. 906—3 34 B. NON NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Influenza.—During the year 20 deaths occurred in the Borough from this cause. This is a decline upon the number during the year 1903. The mortality rate from this disease for 1904 is -08 per 1,000 living. That for London for the same period is .15 per 1,000 living. Chicken Pox—There was no death in Hackney ascribed to this disease during 1904. Diarrhcea.—There were 239 deaths due to this cause in the Borough during 1904.

(a) Complaints.—During the year 1904 there were 2,47. complaints of nuisances received by the Public Health Department, all of which were investigated and dealt with by the officers of the department. (b) Infectious Disease.—There were 1,831 houses inspected in which cases of infectious disease had occurred. Any nuisances dis covered were immediately dealt with by the Sanitary Inspector in whose district the case had occurred. Where necessary, notices were served to secure the abatement of and nuisances found. During the year 2,269 rooms were fumigated and 644 rooms cleansed by the officers of the department. The disinfectants issued to applicants consisted of 792 four-ounce bottles of carbolic acid and 4,470 1 lb. bags of Sanitas powder. The disinfectants issued to the Surveyor and Engineer's Department consisted of the following:— Kuna pine blocks, 1 ton 18 cwt. at 30s. cwt. at a cost of £57 10 0 Carbolic powder, 6 tons 3 cwt. at 44s. ton 13 10 Sanitas powder, Iron, at £6 10s, ton 6 10 0 Kuna pine fluid, 80 gallons, at 3s. gal. 12 0 0 Carbolic acid, 223i gallons, at 8J gal. 7 15 10 £97. 6 5£ (c) House to House Inspection.—During 1904 the Borough Council appointed two temporary inspectors, one on the 1st March and the other on the 28th July, for the purpose of making systematic house to house inspections in certain parts of the Borough, viz., in Homerton and in the London Fields, parts of the borough, densely populated and hencc needing systematic inspection. The number of occupied houses inspected by these officers up to the 31st December was 972. Annexed 41 is a detailed summary of the results of the inspections during that period. Besides these house to house inspections, the district inspectors made in addition ,to their ordinary duties, 571 such inspections, thus giving a total for the year of 1,543 house to house inspections The majority of the nuisances found during inspection, either under the heads of complaints, infectious disease, or house to house inspection were abated on the service of an intimation; 349 required the service of a statutory notice, and 53 legal proceedings before the nuisance found was abated.

Articles Seized and Surrendered Unfit for Food.—During 1904 the following articles of food were seized or surrendered as being unfit for human food, viz.:—27 cwt. 40 lbs. fish, 6 cwt. 26 lbs. fruit and vegetables, 10 cwt. 2 qrs. 10 lbs. meat. In addition to these 1 box herrings, 1 box cods' roes, 1 box kippers, 2 trunks skate, 8 trays of Danish eels, 5 boxes of cherries, 10 boxes strawberries, 4 barrels of apples, 2 boxes oranges, and 2 qrs. 22 lbs. miscellaneous articles. Three prosecutions relating to unsound food were made during the year. One case had reference to the selling of unsound apples. The defendant was fined £2 and 2s. costs; the second case had reference to the deposit of the carcase of a sheep which had suffered from disease where it appeared to be intended for the food of man. The summons was ultimately withdrawn. The third case is referred to below, DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS ORDER. Cow houses.—The number of licensed cow keepers in the district now is one less than during 1903, viz., 23, and the cow sheds licensed 45 number 33, against 37 in 1903. The Inspector, Mr. Bobbitt, who is specially appointed to inspect these premises, reports that he made 301 visits to these cow houses. In two instances he found the sheds in a dirty condition and in another instance he found that the periodical lime washing had not been done within the time specified in the regulations. In five other cases he found excessive accumulations of manure. These defects were remedied immediately on the service of notices. Dairies and Milkshops.—The following statement shows the number of dairies and milkshops in the Borough and the changes which have taken place during the year :— TABLE. PREMISES. NUMBER OF PLACES. Number of Inspections 1904. Number of Notices 1904. Number of Prosecutions, On Register at end of 1908 Added in 1904. Removed in 1804. On Register at end of ino4. Milk premises 430 23 33 420 1,005 9 l Cowsheds 37 — 4 33 301 7 — Slaughter-houses 29 — 2 27 396 2 — Other offensive trade premises 3 — 2 1 41 — — The Inspector reports that he has paid 1,005 visits to these premises during 1904. During these inspections he found dirty utensils on 16 premises. In one case a prosecution was ordered by the Public Health Committee, with the result that the defendant was fined 5s. and 2s. costs. The Inspector also found 12 dairies needing repair and lime washing. Notices were served for these requirements, which were eventually satisfactorily executed. 46 The Public Health Committee made the annual inspection of the cow houses on the 1st October, which they found, on the whole, in a very satisfactory condition. The only defects found were:— 1 dirty water tank and gulley. 1 stable for horse communicating with cow shed. 1 defective paving. During the inspection of the cows houses and dairies, the Committee were impressed with the view, that in the present mode of keeping and milking cows, and in the storage of milk, great opportunities were offered for the pollution of the milk. After careful consideration, the Public Health Committee had the following circular letter drafted, a copy of which was afterward sent to each cow-keeper and milk-vendor in the district. " Sir (or Madam), During a recent inspection by the Public Health Committee of the Cowhouses and Dairies in this Borough, it was ascertained that in some cowsheds the cows were groomed and their udders cleaned before milkiDg, but in the majority of cases this was not done. It was also observed, that in some instances, the cleanliness of the milker left much to be desired. In certain dairies and milkshops the milk was exposed on counters, etc., quite uncovered, and consequently exposed to pollution from falling particles and from air-borne matters and germs. The Committee, having fully considered these fact3, are of opinion that:— 1.—Every milch cow should be groomed at least once a day, and the udder cleaned before each milking. 2.—That no one should milk unless scrupulously clean in person and clothes (preferably a clean overall or blouse, and suitable head covering should be worn). 47 3.—Milk, while being stored or on sale in shops, should be kept as far as possible covered, to keep out falling and other particles. A close-fitting cover should be provided. 4.—That all milk should be efficiently strained through a sterilised strainer before being offered for sale. 5.—All parts of the interior of the cowsheds should be thoroughly brushed down once a month. I am instructed by the Committee to express the hope that you will give such of the matters here touched upon, which concern your business, your careful attention, and adopt the precautions here suggested, with a view to the improvement of the quality of the milk supplied in this district. I am, Sir (or Madam), Yours faithfully, J. King Warry, M.D. Medical Officer of Health I am able to say that the letter has had a good effect, and that the number of milk vendors who cover the milk while it is stored, or on sale in shops, has largely increased. Offensive Trades.—During 1904 two out of the three premises carrying on offensive trades were closed, so at the present time there is only one offensive trade, a tripe boiler, established in Hackney. The Inspector made 41 inspections during the year, and he reports that on each of these occasions he found the premises in a satisfactory condition. Slaughter Houses.—During the year two licences with respect to slaughter houses were allowed to lapse, so that now there are only 27 slaughter houses in the Borough. The Inspector made 396 visits to the slaughter houses of the district during 1904, and as far as possible during slaughtering hours. It was necessary to serve two notices for small repairs, which were duly executed. 48 During the above visits the Inspector examined the carcases of 206 oxen and heifers, 2,047 sheep and lambs, 10 calves, and 20 pigs. He found the following oigans and parts diseased. They were surrendered and duly destroyed. Oxen. Carcase and all the organs affected with Tuberculosis. 8 livers ,, Distomatosis. 4 livers and 1 skirt „ Multiple abscess. ] flank Inflammation. 1 liver and 1 pair of lungs Parasitic cysts. 1 heart Inflammation. Sheep, I carcase and all the organs affected with Pneumonia and in a dying condition 1 liver and lungs 2 pair of lungs Portions of 4 carcases 1 liver 1 neck and shoulder when bled. Parasitic cysts. Pneumonia. Bruising. Distomatosis. Bruising. In the month of July I instructed Mr. Bobbitt, the Cow houses and Slaughter Houses Inspector, to make systematic visits to the preserved meat factories in the Borough. There are six such premises, four of them employing a large number of workmen. There were 27 visits made by the Inspector during the latter half of the year. On one of these visits the Inspector's attention was drawn to several bales of pigs' heads recently delivered. During the examination he found one of the pig's heads badly affected with tuberculosis disease. He seized the head and conveyed it to the police court, where the sitting magistrate condemned the head and made an order for its destruction. Proceedings were taken on the instruction of tne Public Health Committee 49 against the firm in Wiltshire which had sent the pigs' heads to the local manufacturer. The magistrate, after hearing the case, fined the defendants 20s. and 2 guineas costs. In the month of October the Public Health Committee inspected the slaughter houses of the district. On the whole the Committee found the slaughter houses in a clean and satisfactory condition. In only one case were the premises dirty, and in two others the paving was defective. Smoke Nuisances.—During the year 1500 observations were made by the Inspector on chimney shafts in the Borough. These observations lasted on an average from half an hour to one hour. The number of notices served for the abatement of smoke nuisances was 55 intimations and 7 statutory notices. Sec. 48 (2) Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Thirty-eight certificates of proper and sufficient supply of water were issued under the above section to owners of new or rebuilt houses. These certificates covered the water supply to 191 houses and tenements. Bye-laws as to houses Let in Lodgings.—There are now 435 houses registered as houses let in lodgings. These are situated in the most crowded parts of the Borough, viz., Hackney Wick and London Fields. In the former locality 226 are registered, in the later 209. During 1904 the whole of these have been inspected, and any insanitary conditions, such as overcrowding, dirtiness of premises, or structural defects remedied. The following defects were found on inspection Hackney Wick. London Fields. Overcrowding 9 25 Premises requiring cleansing 226 154 Defective drains 13 23 Structural defects 12 170 Animals kept so as to be a nuisance — 4 Underground rooms illegally occupied — 4 906- l 50 Notices were served to secure the remedy of these defects. At the time of writing this report nearly the whole of the defects have been made good. PUBLIC HEALTH LEGISLATION, 1904. During the year 1904 the London County Council introduced into their General Powers Bill certain sections relating to the cleansing of filthy houses and articles, also the alteration of certain classes of sanitary conveniences and fixed ash-pits. The following are the sections dealing with these subjects:— LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1904. Part IV. SANITARY. 19. (1) Where on the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health of any sanitary district, it appears to the sanitary authority of that district that any articles in any house or part thereof in that district are in such a filthy, dangerous, or unwholesome condition that health is affected or endangered thereby or that the cleansing or purifying or destroying of any such articles is requisite to prevent risk of or to check infectious disease the sanitary authority may cause any such articles to be at their own expense cleansed or purified or they may destroy the same.

Section 59 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, shall for the purposes of the last two preceding sections of this Act extend and be applicable to the provision of means for cleansing, purifying, and destroying filthy, dangerous, or unwholesome articles, and for the removal thereof and for the cleansing of houses infested with vermin, as if the said section 59 were re-enacted herein and in terms made applicable thereto. 22.

During the year 1904 eleven applications were made to me by owners of tenement property for certificates that their tenements are so constructed "as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons dwelling therein, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements" in order to obtain a remission from the Inhabited House Duty. The eleven applications included 181 tenements. These I inspected and granted the required certificates after the execution of any necessary alterations. CANAL BOATS ACTS, 1877—1894. The canal boats inspector of the borough who by special arrangement with the Local Government Board devotes one day each week to the visit and inspection of canal boats reports that during 1904 he made 80 visits to the waterways of the district and inspected 71 boats. He found on these boats 115 adults and three children. Of the total number of boats, in only three were there any infringements of the Acts or Regulations.

There are 107 manufacturers of ice creams in the Borough of Hackney. These have been registered and their premises inspected during the past year. The result of these inspections leaves very much to be desired as to the places of manufacture and storage of ice creams. The following table shows the various places in which the ice creams were prepared, frozen and stored. TABLE SHOWING PLACES OP MAKING, FREEZING AND STORING ICECREAMS:— Places.

RIVER LEA The following analysis of samples of water taken from sewage effluents as they were passing into the river Lea indicate the kind and extent of the pollution to which that river was exposed during the summer months of 1904. Nothing has been done since to reduce the pollution, so it may be accepted that the pollution is still continuing.

There are also 157 domestic workshops in the Borough; in 107 of these females alone are employed, and in 50 males and females. In workshops and places of other occupations, females alone are employed in 172, and males and females in 69. Thus in both classes (a and b) of workshops and workplaces, females alone are employed in 782, and both males and females in 173. During the year the following notices and complaints were received from H.M. Inspectors of factories:— Complaints—Factories 0 ,, Workshops 7 Notices—Factories 3 ,, Workshops 76 With respect to the inspection of workshops, Miss Teebay was able to inspect 1,969 workshops (including laundries), 47 factories, 8 workplaces, and 32 homeworkers' premises. Nuisances were found to exist on 436 premises. Miss Teebay dealt with 325 of these, the remainder, 121, involving the execution of structural works, were dealt with by the male inspectors. The nuisances which were abated in connection with workshops, &c., under Miss Teebay, were as follows:— 906—5 66 Cleansing of workrooms 133 Improving ventilation 29 Overcrowding abated 11 Drainage of washhouse floors 4 Extra sanitary accommodation 4 Def. w.c.s, yards, guttering, rain water pipes, floors, and dust bins 142 223 In order to secure the above work being executed, this officer served 214 intimations, 10 statutory notices, and applied for nine summonses. Workroom cards, showing the number of persons permittee in each workroom, were distributed to the number of 216. In addition to the inspection of workshops, Miss Teebay inspected 32 outworkers' premises, and found six of these dirty, three in a dilapidated condition, one with defective roof, four damp walls, three defective dustbins, and in one case there was no dustbin on the premises. These matters were remedied by the service of intimations only. The number of outworkers on the register at the end of 1904 was 2,472, against 1,736 at the end of 1903. This shows an increase of 736 during' the year. The following analysis shows the trades followed by these outworkers :— Trade. No. of Outworkers. Trade.

The names and addresses of these were forwarded to their respective local authorities, as given in the following list:— Bethnal Green 411 Walthamstow 106 Stepney 119 Islington 137 Tottenham 85 Deptford 16 Camberwell 71 Southwark 14 Lewisham 1 Edmonton 13 Ilford 2 East Ham 6 68 St. Pancras 6 Croydon 3 Bermondsey 10 Hampstead 3 Leytonstone 11 Willesden 1 Wood Green 11 New Soutbgate 4 Richmond 2 Poplar 118 Woolwich 2 Stoke Newington 68 Shoreditch 218 Hornsey 4 Leyton 38 Lambeth 17 Wandsworth 2 Westminster 3 Hammersmith 2 Fulham 2 St. Marylebone 2 Battersea 1 St. Albans 1 Cricklewood 2 Ealing 1 City of London 1 Brentford 2 Waltham Cross 1 Paddington 1 West Ham 44 1,570 Finsbury 8 In my report for the year 1903, I stated that the Borough Council had appointed an officer for the sole duty of inspecting and dealing with any insanitary conditions met with in home work places. Miss Newton was appointed for this purpose on the 14th April, and commenced her duties on the 2nd May, 1904. From this latter date up to the end of the year Miss Newton had inspected 766 homeworkers' premises. Her instructions are not only to inspect the workrooms themselves, but also to ascertain the sufficiency or otherwise of the sanitary conveniences on the premises. The following table prepared by this officer shows in detail the nuisances found and the work executed under her supervision up to the end of the vear:— OUTWORKERS' PREMISES AND DOMESTIC WORKSHOPS, MAY TO DECEMBER, 1904.

The total number of persons housed and maintained at the Shelter during last year while their homes were being disinfected was 104 viz., 23 men, 30 women, and 104 children. The total cost of maintenance for the year for these persons was only £13 8s. 9d. The average length of stay at the shelter was 2.06 days. The persons bathed and cleansed at the station suffering from parasiti; disease were 9. The table on page 79 gives these facts in greater detail. CONVEYANCE FOR PERSONS TO AND FROM SHELTER. In the month of May the question of providing a conveyance for persons to and from the Shelter House was considered by the Public Health Committee. It was ascertained that the Metropolitan Asylums Board were prepared to provide conveyances at the following rate per journey : Ambulance, or cab, 5s. Omnibus, 7s. The Committee finally agreed to accept the Board's terms and I was instructed to apply for a conveyance when necessary. During the year the conveyance was required eight times at a total cost of £2 2s.

Below is given a detailed account of the house refuse removed from dwellings in the borough and destroyed by fire at the Municipal destructor works. The house refuse removed amounted during the year 1904 to 37,878 tons. This is a less quantity than that removed during 1903, the amount for this latter year having been 38,640 tons. The total cost of refuse removal last year was £7,999 Is. l1d., against £7,765 10s. 7d. for the previous year. It will be seen from this, that although less refuse was removed during 1904 its cost was greater, being due of course to the increase amount per ton paid to the present contractors. The price per ton now paid for the removal of house refuse is as follows :— Northern division (Mr. Walker, contractor), 4s. 11d. per ton. Southern division (Messrs. Abbott, contractors), 4s. 4d. per ton. The cost of the destruction of the house refuse, including disposal of the residue and clinker left after destruction has been calculated by the Electrical Engineer at 3s. 6½. per ton. This, of course, includes contribution towards the Sinking Fund for payment of loan advanced for the construction of the destructor, also interest and maintenance »o that the total cost for the removal and disposal of the house refuse 906 -6 82 of Hackney is at the rate of 7s. 7½d. per ton on the Northern Division and 7s. 10½d. per ton on the Southern Division. This will give the following totals for the N. and S. Divisions respectively. DUSTING ACCOUNT. Month. Northern Division. Southern Division. Totals. Tons. Cost. Tons. Cost. Tons.

Distributing this sum over the whole of the population of the borough, the cost equals a little over 1s. 3½d. per head per annum ; or taking the occupied houses in the district at 31,000 the cost equals a little over 9s. 5½d. per occupied house per annum. 83 Below is given a table showing the actual number of " refusals " given to the dustmen during each week, and the number of " no answers " given to their knocks. This table is a most interesting one because by it I am able to compare the efficiency of the dust collection with previous years. The following table viewed by itself does not, perhaps, convey the idea of a complete weekly collection of house refuse from occupied dwellings ; for on calculating the average number of " refusals " and " no answers " for the year, the former are seen to number 5,012 per week and the latter 650 per week. These amount to a little over 18 per cent.of the houses visited by the dustmen where they are not able to remove the house refuse. Dust '' Refusals " and " No Answers" for the year 1904. Week ending.

Whereas the total average " refusals " and " no answers " of the latter year amounted to 10,411, the total weekly average for the former year only amounted to 5,662. That is to say, that during 1904 there was a reduction in the average weekly number of " refusals " amounting to nearly 43 per cent. and a reduction in the average weekly number of " no answers " amounting to nearly 60 per cent.

On looking through the tables for previous years, I 85 find that the weekly averages of " refusals " and " no answers " did not begin to diminish until the end of 1901 and the beginning of 1902. This period is coincident with the appointment of an assistant to help the dust superintendent in the supervision of the dust removal. The gradual replacing of fixed dust bins by portable bins has also helped to infusing in the minds of householders the desirableness of regularity in the removal of house refuse. Another fact which I think has contributed towards a more efficient dust collection is the introduction of the system of paying by weight (per ton) and the arrangement made by the contractors with their men to pay them in addition to their standard wage an additional sum for any dust removed beyond a certain amount (two tons each man per day"). I add below the usual list of requests for the removal of dust received during the year. This also shows a considerable improvement upon the numbers for 1903.

Gentlemen,— I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report for the year ending December 31st, 1905. Workshops.—During the year I made 1,969 inspections of workshops (including laundries), 47 inspections of factories, 8 inspections of workplaces, and 32 inspections of homeworkers' premises. Of these, 11 visits were prompted by complaints to the Medical Officer of Health from H.M. Factory Inspectors and other persons. In accordance with section 133 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, 73 workshops were notified to H.M. Factory Inspectors for the district. It will be noticed that the number of workshops thus notified is larger than last year. This is owing to the fact that no less than 47 unregistered workshops were discovered by my colleague, Miss Newton, during her inspection of outworker's premises. I found nuisances existing on 436 premises. In 121 cases the nuisances were handed over by the Medical Officer of Health to the District Sanitary Inspectors to be dealt with by them. The remainder I dealt with myself, and can report that 133 workrooms were cleansed, ventilation was improved in 29 workrooms, overcrowding remedied in 11, adequate means for the drainage of wash-house floors was provided in four cases, and extra sanitary accommodation in four cases. While general nuisances relating to defective conditions of w.c.'s, yards, guttering, rainwater pipes, floors, roofs, and dustbins were abated in 142 instances. I have served 214 intimation notices, 41 final notices, 10 statutory notices, and applied for nine summonses. 92 We have now on the register 955 workshops, including 144 laundries, in which women and female young persons are employed. Workroom cards showing the number of persons permitted in each room have been distributed to 216 workrooms. Outworkers.—In the early months of the year, before the appointment of Miss Newton, I inspected 32 outworkers' premises. I found six of these premises dirty; three dilapidated ; one with defective roof, four with damp walls, three with defective dustbins, and one without a dustbin. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ALICE TEEBAY. 03 Record oj Prosecutions wider the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the year 1904. Address. Complaint. Magistrate's Decision. Penalty.
