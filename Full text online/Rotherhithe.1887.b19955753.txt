Several communications having been received from the Secretary to the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the People, with reference to alleged defects in Sanitary appliances at various houses in the parish, the Vestry on the 15th November, 1887, passed a resolution as follows, viz.: "Resolved, that it be referred to the Sanitarv Committee to inspect the houses "in the streets, courts and alleys in the parish where considered necessary, with the "view of having the same put in proper sanitary condition, and report thereon." The Sanitary Committee thereupon inspected 892 houses in various streets and places in the parish, and upon the report of the Committee, the Vestrv caused notices to be served upon the Owners of houses where Sanitary defects were found to exist, requiring the carrying out of the necessary works to remedy the same, which were attended to. A letter dated 6th January, 1888, having been received from the Assistant Secretary of the Local Goverment Board, forwarding a copy of the letter which had 19 been addressed to that Board by the Mansion House Council on the dwellings of the People, respecting the Sanitary condition of certain portions of the parish, and requesting that the Board might be furnished with the observations of the Vestry upon the subject of the communication, the Vestry caused a reply to the said letter to be forwarded as follows:— The Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrev. Offices—Public Baths, Lower Road, Rotherhithe, 21 st January, 1888. Sir, I am directed by the Vestry to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, inclosing copy of a letter dated December 28th, 1887, addressed to the Secretary of the Local Government Board by the Hon. Secretary of the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the People and requesting that the Board may be furnished with the observations of the Vestry on the subject of this communication. In answer, I am directed to state for the information of the Board that the various communications received from the Mansion House Council, have, as they came to hand, been immediately referred to this Vestry to the Sanitary Committee, who have since made a house-to-house visitation in about half the number of cases referred to, and they are proceeding with an inspection of the remainder with as much despatch as possible. In all cases where nuisances were found to exist which the Vestry could deal with notices have been served, many of which have already been attended to, and in all cases where default is made the Vestrv will take proceedings to enforce compliance with the Acts of Parliament. The Vestry desire me to point out that some months ago they made a similar visitation of courts and allevs, and they are quite alive to the necessity of enforcing the proper sanitarv regulations, but owing to the very poor class of people who chiefly 20 inhabit the district visited by the Mansion House Council, it is a matter of great difficulty, as so much depends upon the occupiers themselves, and the experience of the Vestry is, that dust bins, water closets and cistern covers go for firewood directly they are provided. The Vestry further desire me to state that they have done and will continue to do all that lies in their power to ensure that the dwellings of the inhabitants of this parish are kept in a proper sanitary condition. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. Alfred D. Adrian, Esq., Assistant Secretary, The Local Government Board, Whitehall. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875.

A letter having been received from the Treasurer of the Amicable School as follows, viz.:— 20th March, 1888. To the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe. Gentlemen, In pursuance of a Resolution passed at a Meeting of the Trustees and Managers of the Amicable School. I beg to apply to you with reference to the yearly rent charge of £6, bequeathed by Hill and Bell in the year 1613. As it appears that the only security for the payment of this rent charge is upon land forming part of the existing Churchyard, in which the parishioners have had and still enjoy a benefit, there is, I venture to think a very strong moral obligation on the part of the Vestry 27 to pay this yearly sum of £6. I appeal to you, taking into consideration the whole of the circumstances, of which I believe you are fully aware, to favourably consider the matter. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, (Signed) EDWARD JOSSELYN BECK, Treasurer of the Amicable School. The Vestry referred the said letter to the General Purposes Committee for consideration. The General Purposes Committee having on the 3rd April, 1888, reported they had considered the letter dated 20th March, 1888, received from the Treasurer of the Amicable School, with reference to the yearly rent charge of £6 bequeathed by Hill and Bell in 1613, which cannot now be recovered from the property originally charged with the payment thereof, the site of which now forms portion of the Churchyard and the public way Church Street, and evidence having been produced to the Committee that the parish is receiving the benefit of the site of the said property which was thrown into the public way Church Street for the improvement thereof, it was "Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the said sum "of £6 per annum be paid by the Vestry."

Edward Joselyn Beck, the Rector), announced that it was his pleasing duty to read a letter which he had received from Mr. Carr Gomm, intimating Mr. and Mrs. Carr Gomms generous intention to Commemorate the Queen's Jubilee, by Enfranchising the land 30 on which the Public Baths and Wash-houses are erected and bestowing it as a gift to the Parish of Rotherhithe, as follows, viz.:— Redriff, Boyn Hill, Maidenhead, June 23rd, 1887. Mv Dear Mr. Beck, Mrs. Carr-Gomm and myself have been wishing to do something to commemorate this year in a way which will best benefit the whole of Rotherhithe. Being only a tennant for life, she is not able as we might wish to deal with any of the freehold property; but we are arranging with the Trustees to purchase the treehold of the Baths and Wash-houses, and if this could be effected as I have every reason to believe, we propose to enfranchise the Baths and Wash-houses, which will, not only save the Ratepayers the present annual rent of £80 a year; but will obviate the rack rent of the same at the expiration of the present Lease. We trust that the Building may always be maintained in its present good condition, and continue to be what I believe it now is, a real benefit to the neighbourhood, and a credit to the Parish. Will you as Chairman, kindly communicate this to the Vestry, at your next meeting. I am, Yours very sincerely, Rev. E. J. Beck. F. C. CARR-GOMM. It was therefore unanimously "Resolved, that the best thanks of this Vestry be given to Mr. and Mrs. Carr- "Gomm, for the very munificent gift they have signified their intention of bestowing "upon this Parish, in commemoration of Her Majesty's Jubilee; and this Vestry "further desire to express to Mr. and Mrs. Carr-Gomm their sense of the kindly "feeling which has prompted them in making such Gift as shewing the lively interest "they take in the welfare of the Parish, and also to assure them that nothing could "have given more universal satisfaction to the Vestry and Ratepayers at large." It was also 31 "Resolved, that Mr. Carr-Gomm's letter be entered on the Minutes of the "Vestry." The Commissioners of the Baths and Wash-houses have caused a Tablet to be erected on the main front of the Baths, Lower-road, recording the before-mentioned Jubilee Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Carr-Gomm, with an inscription thereon, as follows viz.:— On the 24th day of June, 1887, In commemoration of the Jubilee of the Reign of Her Most Gracious Majesty QUEEN VICTORIA. Emily Blanche Carr-Gomm, the wife of Francis Culling Carr-Gomm, Esquire, presented the freehold site of these Public Baths and Wash-houses to the Commissioners, for the Benefit of the Parish of Rotherhithe.

Gentlemen, I am directed by the Overseers of the Poor of this Parish, to inform you that in pursuance of a requisition to that effect signed by upwards of ten ratepayers, 32 they proceeded to ascertain the opinions of the ratepayers as to whether or not the Public Libraries' Acts should be adopted in this parish, by the issue of a voting paper to each ratepayer and the subsequent collection and scrutiny thereof as directed by the 40th and 41st Vic., cap. 54, sec. 1. The number of voting papers issued by the Overseers was 5384 of which 922 could not be delivered and 550 could not be collected. 1361 were returned in blank and 133 were rejected for informality, leaving 2418 as the number of ratepayers voting on the question, of this number 1589 voted in favour of the adoption of the Acts and 829 against, leaving a majority in favour 760. The Overseers beg to submit their accounts of the expenses incurred by them in taking the Poll, and request that the Vestry will sanction the payment thereof as provided by Sec. 83 of the Public Libraries' Act, 1855. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) JAMES J. STOKES, To the Vestry of Rotherhithe. Vestry Clerk.

We feel deeply sensible of the general prosperity enjoyed by all classes of your Majesty's subjects, coupled with the great and unprecedented expansion of the Empire since your Majesty's accession to the throne. We are further mindful of the many beneficient measures which have been passed with your Majesty's hearty concurrence and approbation, especially for the amelioration and benefit of the working classes and for the advancement of Education among the young. It is our earnest prayer that you may long be spared to rule over your loyal subjects, and that Almighty God may still vouchsafe a continuance of those Heavenly blessings which have so long and abundantly been granted to Your Majesty. In token whereof the Common Seal of the Vestrv of Rotherhithe was hereto affixed by Order, datad 5th day of July, 1887, in the presence of EDWD.

And I have to inform you that Her Majesty was pleased to receive the same very graciously. I have the Honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) HENRY MATTHEWS. Rev. E. J.

On the 19th April, 1887, the Vestrv passed the following resolution, viz.:— "Resolved, that the Vestry having learned that the London School Board has "passed a resolution increasing the Salary of the Clerk from £1,200 to £1,400 per "annum, desires to record its ernest protest against any increase of an already large "salary, at a time when the burden of the rates presses very heavily upon the ratepayers, "and trusts that the resolution in question may be rescinded." "Resolved, that a copy of the foregoing resolution be sent to the School Board for "London, and also to each of the Members of the said Board representing this District, "and that they be requested to support it." The Vestry having had under consideration a resolution passed by the Vestry of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, as follows, viz.:— "That it was equitable that succeeding generations be made chargeable to a "greater extent than at present with the cost of freeholds, school buildings and other "permanent works of the School Board for London, and in order to that end the "payments to the sinking fund of the Board be extended from 50 to 100 years; by this 35 "means a relief of from £60,000 to £70,000 of the annual precept will be effected "(being at the rate of about ½d. in the pound). Also that it is desirable that the "Board be authorised to obtain Parliamentary powers to issue 3 per cent. Stock on the "Security of their freehold land, buildings, and rates, or as an alternative that the "Metropolitan Board of Works be requested to advance Loans to the School Board for "London on the same terms at which the said Loans plus expenses are taken up by the "public," it was "Resolved, that this Vestry support the said resolution, and that the Clerk be instructed to write to the representatives of the School Board for London for this Division of Southwark requesting them to support the same." The Vestry having had under consideration the Water Companies (Regulation of Powers) Bill before the House of Commons, on the 3rd May, 1887, they passed a resolution as follows:— "Resolved, that the Clerk be instructed to write to the Members of Parliament for "this Division Southwark requesting them to support the Water Companies (Regula"tion of Powers) Bill in the House of Commons, the object of which is to prevent "Water Companies discontinuing the supply of Water to dwelling houses for non-pay"ment of water rate, in cases where the Owner and not the Occupier is liable for the "same."

Report of the Committee appointed by the Vestry ot Rotherhithe to confer with the other Vestries and District Boards interested upon the subject of Thames Communications. Your Committee beg to report as follows, viz.: That on the 8th October, 1886 they held a preliminary meeting at which Mr. Tolhurst was present, who stated that the Metropolitan Board of Works had obtained 36 estimates from Sir Joseph Bazalgette of the cost respectively of a Subway and a Bridge the former being estimated at £2,200,000 and the latter at £625,000 without the approaches. It was Resolved to invite the Vestries of Shadwell, St. George's-in-theEast, Whitechapel, Hackney, Bethnal Green, and Bermondsey to send Delegates to meet your Committee in Conference, and subsequently the District Boards ot Greenwich and Lewisham, and the Vestries of Camberwell, Shoreditch, and Mile End Old Town were also included. In response to your Committee's invitation the Vestries of Bermondsey, Bethnal Green, Hackney, St. George's-in-the-East, Whitechapel, Mile End Old Town and Camberwell appointed representatives to attend the Conference, but Hackney subsequently withdrew. Meetings were accordingly held in this Vestries' Board-room and adjourned from time to time at which the opinions of the several representatives have been obtained, the general opinion being that a means of communication is urgently needed, and that such communication should be by way of a Bridge in preferance to a Subway. The last meeting of your Committee and the aforesaid representatives was held on the 25th April, 1887, when the following resolution was moved by Mr. Bulmer of Rotherhithe, seconded by Mr. Bonallack, of St. Georges-in-the-East, was unanimously passed, viz.:— That this meeting being of opinion that a Bridge across the Thames between Rotherhithe and Wapping will be the best means of communication, and more conducive to the general convenience of the Public, a Deputition from the Boards of Works and Vestries now present, and others interested in the matter wait upon the Metropolitan Board of Works and present a joint Memorial urging that Board to proceed at the earliest possible date to obtain power for the erection of a low level Bridge across the Thames from Rotherhithe to Wapping. It was at the same meeting further Resolved to invite the landowners and ratepayers of the parishes interested, the Members of Parliament, and the Members of the Metropolitan Board of Works for the several districts to a meeting to be held at this Vestry s Board -room, on Monday, the 23rd day of May, 1887, for the purpose of 37 determining as to carrying into effect the above resolution, and to appoint as influential a deputation as possible. (Signed), E. RUMNEY SMITH, Chairman. On the 10th June, 1887, a Joint Deputation from the Vestries of Rotherhithe St. George-in-the-East, and other Vestries, &c., introduced bv Mr. John Tolhurst and consisting of Col. C. E. Hamilton, M P., Mr. Lafone, M.P., Revd. E. J. Beck Mr. E. R. Smith, Mr. J. Bulmer, Mr. R. Foottit, Mr. S Chafen, Mr. T. Aldridge Mr. F. J. Bisley, Mr. S. W. Copping, Mr. J. Griffin, Mr. H. L. Bartlett, Mr. W. J. Bonallack, and other gentlemen waited upon the Metropolitan Board of Works and presented Memorials from Parishes and District Boards, viz.:—The Vestries of Rotherhithe, St. George-in-the-East, St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, and the Board of Works for the Whitechapel District, the following being a copy of the Memorial presented on behalf of the Vestry of Rotherhithe, viz.:— To the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the Countv of Surrev, under their Common Seal. SHEWETH— That your Memorialists desire to impress upon your Honourable Board the existing necessity for improved means of communication between the South Eastern and North Eastern districts of the Metropolis, bv reason of the large increase of traffic during recent years, and the loss of time and money now experienced, in conscquence of the difficulty of obtaining access from one side of the River to the other, east of London Bridge. That in the unanimous opinion of your Memorialists any such communication should be by means of a low-level free bridge to be constructed across the I hames, between Rotherhithe and Wapping, with approaches on either side, starting respectively from points to be determined upon, in the Deptford Lower Road, in the Parish of Rotherhithe, and in Old Gravel Lane, in the Parish of Wapping, or in such other positions within the said Parishes as your Honourable Board may deem advisable. That although the Tower Bridge, now in construction by the Corporation of the City of London, may in some degree relieve the existing want, it will not do so to any 38 great extent, being too near London Bridge, and too far from the principal stream of traffic which would be taken by a Bridge in the locality suggested by your Memorialists as herein mentioned. That the erection of a Bridge commends itself to your Memorialists both on the ground of its being most conducive to the general convenience of the public as well as on the question of expense, the estimate of the cost of a Bridge being considerably less than the estimated cost of a Subway, as to which fact your Memorialists believe your Honourable Board has already satisfied itself. Your Memorialists thereof humbly pray That your Honourable Board will proceed, at the earliest possible date, to obtain powers from Parliament for the erection of a low-level free Bridge across the Thames, from Rotherhithe to Wapping, either in the locality suggested by your Memorialists or at such other places within the Parishes aforesaid, as your Honourable Board may deem most advisable. And your Memorialists will ever pray, &c. The Common Seal of the Vestry of Rotherhithe, was affixed hereto bv order, this 9th day of June, 1887. (Signed) JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. Seal of the Vestry. when the Board referred the said Memorials to their Works and General Purposes Committee for consideration. On the 31st October, 1887, the Vestry received a communication from the Clerk to the Metropolitan Board of Works, with reference to the Memorials presented to the Board on the 10th June, 1887, on behalf of the Vestry of Rotherhithe and other Vestries and District Boards on both sides of the River at the east end of London, asking the Board to obtain powers for the erection of a low-level Bridge across the Thames from Rotherhithe to Wapping, and 39 stating, the Board on the 14th October, 1887, having considered several requests which were before it for improvements in various parts of London, came to the conclusion that it would not apply to Parliament next Session for power to carry out any improvements in respect of which the Vestries or District Boards of the Districts interested were not prepared to contribute part of the cost, the Board therefore could not submit to Parliament next Session any proposal for the construction of a Bridge across the Thames from Rotherhithe to Wapping. On the 4th October, 1887, the Vestry received a Deputation, who submitted a memorial, it was proposed to present to the Chairman and Directors of the South Eastern Railway, and urged the Vestry to support their views before the Chairman and Directors of the Railway Company.

Gentlemen, "We, the undersigned residents in the neighbourhood of the Boundaries of the "Parishes of St. Mary, Rotherhithe, St. Paul's, Deptford, and St. Giles', Camber"well, in close juxtaposition to your line of Railway, humbly call your attention "to the great inconvenience arising on account of the want of access to the various "Stations on your line, and pray that as the population in this immediate neigh"bourhood has increased so enormously, and that over 2,000 houses have been "erected during the last four years within a radious of half-a-mile, we humbly "ask that your honourable Board will take into consideration the advisability of "constructing a Station at or near the site of the Old Commercial Dock Station," It was "Resolved, that a Deputation consisting of nine members of the Vestry be appointed to wait upon the Directors of the South Eastern Railway in support of the Memorial of the inhabitants of this parish for increased Station accommodation on the said Railway. On the 27th October, 1887, the Deputation appointed by the Vestry, viz.:— Messrs. John Bulmer, Francis John Bisley, Samuel Ward Copping, Henry Lovel 40 Bartlett, Robert Leishman, Stewart, Lawrence Stevens, Edward James Talbot, and Messrs. E. Rumney Smith and Francis Thomas Talbot, Churchwardens, accompanied by John Tolhurst, Esq., member of the Metropolitan Board of Works attended by appointment, at the Offices of the South Eastern Railway Company, and presented a Memorial as follows, viz.:— To the Directors of the South Eastern Railway Company. The Memorial of the Vestrv of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrev, under their Common Seal : Sheweth, That a Deputation from this Vestry waited upon the Directors of your Company, in the year 1878, and urged upon them the necessity which then existed for an additional Station between Deptford and Spa-road, a large new neighbourhood having there sprung up in this Parish adjacent to the South Eastern Railway Company's line which was pointed out by the Vestry to Sir Edward Watkin and the late Mr. John Shaw, who subsequently visited the locality. That since the period referred to, the following Estates have been opened out and built upon in the neighbourhood of Rotherhithe New-road, adjacent to the South Eastern Railway, whereby a large increase in the population has taken place, namely: Abbett-street, Ilderton, Cranswick, Bramcote, Delaford, Creedon, Barkworth, Verney and Varcoe Roads, Millidge and Egan Streets, Alice Terrace and Catlin Street, Bermondsey New-road, Rolls-road, Bonamy-street and part of St. James'-street, Bolina, Lampa and Senegal Roads, and the St Helena Estate containing the following Roads, namely: Bracton, Eugenia, Alpine, Fawcett, Reculver, Goodson, Cornbury, Rudford, and Oldfield-road, the increase in the number of houses in Rotherhithe alone since 1878, being 515. That since 1878 the increase in the population of Rotherhithe is 6,339 ; most of the houses in the new streets above referred to being built for and occupied by two families, the class of people occupying the same being clerks and mechanics, many of whom work in the City and West-end who have to walk to Spa-road which is upwards of a mile distant, the South Bermondsey Station of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company being of little or no service, not taking them beyond London Bridge. 41 That the want of an additional Station between Deptford and Spa-road is most urgently needed for the better accommodation of this large population, and in order to relieve the congested traffic at Spa-road, which is attended with so much risk and inconvenience to the public. Your Memorialists therefore pray that your Honourable Board of Directors will take the above facts into your favourable consideration, and provide the requisite Station accommodation between Deptford and Spa-road as desired. And your Memorialists will ever pray. Seal Mr. Kelly, M.P., for Camberwell, attended on behalf of that parish, and there were also present many of the inhabitants of the Destrict. That the Deputation was received by Mr. Beattie, one of the Directors (in the absence of Sir Edward Watkin), and having heard the several memorials read, and Mr. Kelly, M P. Mr. John Bulmer, and other gentlemen having spoken in support thereof urging the Directors to provide the requisite accommodation. Mr. Beattie stated he would place the matter before the Directors at their next meeting. The matter is still under the consideration of the Directors of the South Eastern Railway. In February, 1888, an Agreement was entered into between the Vestry of the Parish of Bermondsey, and the Vestry of Rotherhithe, that the Vestry of Bermondsey should at their own expense repair, maintain, cleanse and water the whole of that portion of the cariageway of Rotherthithe New-road, which lies west of No. 271, Rotherhithe New-road, and also the whole of the carriageway of Southwark Park-road from Galleywall-road to Jamaica-road; and that the Vestry of Rotherhithe should at their own expense repair, maintain, cleanse and water the carriageway of the whole of that portion of the Rotherhithe New-road which lies opposite to and east of 271 42 Rotherhithe New-road, and also the whole of the carriageway of Galleywall-road, from Southwark Park-road to Rotherhithe New-road such agreement to be determinable after six calendar months notice by either Vestry to the other of them. The Vestry having had under consideration a letter received from the Clerk to the Vestry of Lambeth with copy resolutions passed by that Vestry as follows, viz.:— "That the amount of Poor-rate is very unequal in the several London "Parishes, and this Vestry is of opinion that there should be one uniform "Poor-rate over all the Metropolitan area. "That this Vestry is of opinion that it is a great injustice to the rate"payers of the Metropolis that all the improvements effected in London should "be paid by the householders, and the Vestry recommend that the ground rents "and improved values of Land should be rated to the Metropolitan rates in future, "the land to be rateable and chargeable upon and from the same persons and with "the same right of deduction as property tax, under Schedule 4 A."' It was Resolved, that the Vestry approves of the foregoing resolutions of the Vestry of the Parish of Lambeth and will co-operate with that Vestry in support of the suggestions therein contained. The Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. Under the provisions of the above Act, the totals of the Gross and Rateable Values of properties in the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the Supplemental Valuation List coming in force, on the 6th day of April, 1888, are as follows, viz.:— Grorss Value. Rateable Value. £259,661 £209,395 43 APPENDIX NO. 1. THE ANNUAL REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, From March 25th, 1887, to March 25th, 1888. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of Rotherhithe: — Gentlemen, I herewith present to your notice the following matters pertaining to the Sanitation of the parish, being a summarised account of the various reports which have been regularly read to you at your meetings. At the risk of appearing somewhat prolix: I take the following words from my report for the year ending March, 1886. "The bases upon which the calculations "embodied in the following report are founded, are first, the number of inhabitants "in my last report, and secondly, the natural increase which has been registered from week to week." "I speak of natural increase, for it is not in my power to ascertain the increase due "to the greater accommodation from the building that has been going on during the "period of this report. This could only be got at by a fresh census. As I have "not that basis to work upon, and as I would rather not make a guess as to what "it might be, it will be more reasonable, though perhaps it may not be absolutely "correct, to procecd upon the first method of calculation. Of course, this mode "of procedure is open to one serions objection, that is, it is not a mathematically "correct basis, but only shows an approximation to the total number of persons living "in the parish." This apology I am happy to say, is now no longer needful. I have been able to ascertain the number of houses built since the last census; and what is of importance, have at the suggestion of Shirley Murphy, Esq., and with your sanction, obtained from Somerset House, a list of the number of parishioners who have died 44 in institutions outside the parish. By these means an almost mathematically correct basis is formed upon which my calculations are founded. And as the reports from Somerset House are to be forwarded annually, a calculable source of error will be thus rectified. No. of Births registered:— Males. Females. Totals. In the first quarter 165 189 354 In the second quarter 186 181 367 In the third quarter 183 161 344 In the fourth quarter 192 174 366 726 705 1431 No. of Deaths registered:— Males. Females. Totals.

Females. Total. 57 32 89 Of persons (non-parishioners) whose deaths have been registered in this parish, the following is the number: One hundred and eleven from the Infirmary; twenty 45 drowned in the docks; five deaths from falls in ships, and one killed on railway; giving a total of 137 So that the entire number of deaths is: 937 + 89-137=887. And upon this number I have estimated the death-rate. Birth-rate. The birth-rate per thousand per annum is 32.5. Death-rate. The death-rate per thousand per annum is 20. * Uncertified Deaths. During the twelve months all the causes of death have been legally certified.. Inquests. Fifty-nine inquests have been held. The Coroner's Verdicts being as follow:— Drowned 20; natural causes 11; infantile convulsions 11; falls in various parts of ships 5; overlying 3; heart disease 3; sudden effusion of blood from lungs 1; diarrhoea 1; wilfully murdered 1 (by an Italian) ; accidental 1; killed on railway 1. Zymotic Diseases. The deaths due to these diseases are: diarhœa 37; scarlet fever 14; measles 7; typhoid fever 6; diphtheria 6; whooping cough 3; Typhus fever none; small pox none. Total 73, giving a death-rate of 1.65 per thousand per annum. (The number in previous twelve months was 81). Of the deaths from diarrhoea, 35 were of infants, and were due in a great majority of cases to complication with marasmus and convulsions. The deaths from measles were entirely amongst children. In these the real causes of death were pneumonia and acute bronchitis. 1887-8. 1886-5. 1885-6.

These houses, of which there are twenty-six, have been periodically inspected. Notices were obliged to be served on some of the owners, who were judged not to keep their places in so sanitary a condition as was desirable and possible. Slaughter-Houses and Cow-Sheds. Upon the annual application fur renewal of licenses, as well as at various other times, these premises have been examined, and reported upon as being in" such a condition as to warrant a renewal of the licenses. Acorn Place. In March, 1887, my attention having been called to the state of Acorn Place, I visited and reported specially upon it to the following effect:—The complaint is almost entirely as to the state of the road from Nos. 5 to 10. The water had accumulated to a depth of six inches, over the gulley grating, gradually decreasing in depth in each direction. The road in this part was covered with mud. As the water seemed to be purely surface-water (not mixed with any house-refuse), and was more a matter of annoyance, than an injury to health, the suggestions I then made to the Vestry have since been carried out. 47 Quodling's Manufactory. On several occasions, and by various persons, notices were given of an offensive effluvium emanating from these works. I visited them a few times alone, and once in the company of the Inspector from the Metropolitan Board of Works. The matter was taken to the Greenwich Police Court. Since then no serious complaints have been received. Booth's Mineral Water Works. In June, 1887, the Surveyor of Sewers requested that these premises should be inspected by me. The condition of the VV.Cs., a trap near to them, the flooring, and roofing were the points demanding attention. The Clerk served notice upon the owner to provide sufficient and suitable W.C. accommodation, and also to provide a proper receptacle for the waste then being thrown into the drain and sewer, as this waste forms an incrustation and so blocks up the drains. Nothing of permanent good came of the notice. The place is now closed. Credon Road. In July, I received notice of offensive odours in the rear of Nos. 2, 4, and 6, Credon-road. I visited the houses, and also the premises—the latter consists of two leather dressing factories. The chief cause of nuisance was the keeping of pigs. They were got rid of, and there has been no further complaint. Railway Arches. During the year, my attention has several times been called to the great nuisance caused by the stowage of offensive matter, and the carrying on of obnoxious trades in the arches. As in the majority of cases the arches are sub-let. I beg to quote the words used in my report of September 20th, 1887. "I am surprised at "the indifference and thoughtlessness with which persons sub-let such places for such "purposes, utterly regardless of the comfort and health of their neighbours. It is "high time that they who are so inclined, and are able to gratify their inclina"tion should understand that the Vestry are firmly resolved not to allow such "abuses of privilege, and are also determined to put a stop to such attempts." 48 Conveyance of Offensive Substances through the Streets. The subjoined letter was in answer to a request from the Metropolitan Board of Works asking for information on this subject. "The collection and carriage of offensive materials through the streets is "chiefly by means of iron tanks and vans with tarpauling covers. The greatest "part of the collection is done during the evening. The stowage lasts but for a "few hours in places where the material is exposed to the open air. When how"ever the material is emptied into premises under railway arches, it remains "partially exposed and open (within the arch) for a considerable period of time. "The premises for the storage of offensive materials are under the supervision "of the Inspector of Nuisances, who has instruction from the Vestry to visit "them regularly and report upon them. The complaints with respect to these "offensive materials have not hitherto been so much as to the mode of collection "and carriage through the streets, but rather as to the manner, duration, and the "place of stowage. The Vestry has been using means during the last two years "to induce the owners of premises used for the storage of these offensive materials to abate the nuisance—partial success only, has attended their efforts. Mansion House Council. On October 18th, 1887, I read a synopsis of complaints received from the Secretary of the Council. The matters were referred to the Sanitary Committee.
