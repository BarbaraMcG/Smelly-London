Of these, 106 were legitimate and 8 illegitimate. Corrected Births and Birth-Rate. I received from the Registrar-General information of the births in outlying institutions in London of 142 legitimate infants and 32 illegitimate infants whose mothers were residents of the Borough. Eight of the births occurring in the Borough were infants of mothers who were not resident in the Borough. The corrected number oi births is therefore 280, and the corrected birth-rate 8 09. The following is the corrected number of births and the corrected birth-rates for the year 1937:— Year. Total Births. Legitimate Births. Illegitimate Births. No. Rate per 1,000 of population.

This correction, together with deaths transferred from extra Metropolitan Institutions, accounts for the variation in the number of deaths given in the four quarterly reports of the Registrar-General and in his Annual Report. The final correction supplied by the Registrar-General for 1937 gives the total deaths for the Borough as 410. Corrected Deaths and Death-Rates, 1937, compared with 1936. Year.

The following table shows the nuisances for which the 46 Statutory Notices were issued under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936:— Houses. Factories, etc Section 82 (1)- (a) Dirty, dilapidated, damp premises, etc.. 14 2 (b) W.C.'s, drains, etc. 28 — (c ) Accumulation of refuse 8 3 (d) Overcrowding — — Section 104—Waterclosets, dirty, defective, etc. 10 2 Section 105—Ashbins 1 1 Section 105—W.C., provision of 2 — Section 106—W.C. accommodation for sexes — 4 Section 107—Receptacles for dung — 1 Section 128—Nuisance from Factories, etc. — 4 By-Laws as to Houses let-in-lodgings. At the end of the year, 394 houses were registered under these By-laws. Of these, 187 were wholly or partly decontrolled under the Rent Acts at the end of 1937. There were 871 inspections of these premises, excluding a large number of periodical inspections and re-inspections. 72 notices were served for breaches of the By-laws, in addition to 426 notices that were served for annual cleansing as required by the By-laws. Rag and Bone Dealers. On inspection of rag and bone shops made in the year 1937, one breach was found of the By-laws made by tbe London County Council for regulating the conduct of this business. Notice was served on the owner requiring him to comply with the By-laws. Rats and Mice (Destruction) Aot, 1919. During the year, under the provisions of the above Act, 227 separate premises were inspected, ranging from small dwelling houses to large blocks of offices and business premises. In 98 cases the Inspectors discovered evidence of rat infestation. Notices under the Act were served as necessary, and advice given with a view to adequate 22 steps being taken to eradicate the vermin. In 32 cases traps were used, 19 occupiers laid down poison baits. In 32 cases professional rat catchers were employed, and in 40 cases the nuisances were abated following new drainage or satisfactory methods of rat-proofing. The Rat Officers reported that in a number of cases where no evidence of rats was found at their inspections the satisfactory condition was the result of continued efforts, initiated in previous years, for rat repression, such as the regular use of traps, cats, poisons, or the employment of professional rat catchers. The following is a summary in tabular form of the conditions found and action taken in the various wards of the Borough:— Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. Summary of conditions found on inspections, action taken and results obtained. WARD. Number of premises inspected. Number rat infested. Action for Rat Repression. RESULT. Traps. Poisons.

In response to the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, "Rat Week "was observed in the Borough in the week commencing 1st November, 1937:— The following is a summary of the action taken:— (i) Prior to the week the District Sanitary Inspectors visited premises known or suspected to be rat infested, and advised that intensive action for dealing with the nuisance should be taken during rat week. In a number of cases definite arrangements for such action were made. (ii) The preparatory visits were followed by revisits during or after rat week when the Inspectors reported that the agreed action had been taken. (iii) Letters weie sent to all chemists and hardware dealers in the Borough asking them to stock and display, during rat week, suitable poisons and traps. (iv) The Ministry of Agriculture Poster was exhibited throughout the Borough. (v) The rat baits laid in the Council's sewers were increased in rat week to 4,000, uid during the last week in December this increased number was repeated by placing 4,000 baits in the same sewers. In connection with this the Borough Engineer and Surveyor writes:— "Rat repression is so successful in the sewers of the Borough that difficulty is experienced in getting all the baits taken owing to the continuous cleansing of the sewers and systematic laying of baits. In fact, in many sewers it is quite unusual to find any rats or traces of them. "The Sewer Foreman and the Sewer Gangers all speak highly of the efficiency of the baits used." Drainage Works. Every house in the Borough is connected with the water carriage system for the disposal of sewage. Work connected with new drainage, reconstruction of dd systems and alterations to existing drainage, is supervised by the Sanitary Inspectors. During the year 112 applications were received for the Council's approval to proposed drainage and sanitary works. All the applications received were approved, subject in some instances to amendments being made which were necessary in order to secure compliance with the London County Council Drainage By-laws. Smoke Abatement. The smoke shafts in the Borough were kept under frequent inspection, 215 observations being recorded. A number of these were made in the early morning, when smoke pollution is more prevalent; and frequently the observations extended for periods of not less than one hour, Nine complaints were received of nuisances 24 from the emission of smoke. As the result of inspections made, one intimation notice was served. The use of unsatisfactory coal is the common cause of smoke nuisance; such use sometimes arises when attempts are made to effect economy in running plant. Usually a visit by the Inspector or a letter from the Medical Officer of Health secures immediate abatement of the nuisance. In accordance with its powers under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the Council made a small contribution towards the cost of the work for smoke abatement carried on by the National Smoke Abatement Society. Inspection of Workshops, etc. The routine inspection of factories, workshops and workplaces has been carried out during the year. 259 factories were inspected, 211 workshops and 1,479 workplaces. It is found that changes frequently occur in the occupation of workshops. To obtain information of such changes and further details of industrial conditions in the Borough a large number of visits and inspections were made in addition to the routine inspections mentioned above. As the result of these visits 19 premises no longer used for the purpose for which they had been registered were removed from the register of workshops. In some cases, owing to the introduction of machinery, former"workshops' had become "factories" and the necessary transfer to the factory register was effected. Variations in the staff employed were also frequently reported. During the year 16 workshops were added to the register. At the end of the year there were 630 workshops on the register. 383 employed men only, 40 employed women only, and 207 employed both men and women. The number of employees is often very small and many of the workshops are in tenement houses (houses let in lodgings). No fewer than 156 different industries are carried on in these workshops, among the principal being the following:— No. of Workshops Employing Men only. Women only. Both Sexes. Total. Boot makers and repairers 14 1 2 17 Builders 11 —- — 11 Carpenters 15 — 1 16 Clock and watch makers 18 — I 19 Dressmakers and ladios' tailors — 11 21 32 Diamond mounters 8 — 1 9 Engravers 20 — 1 21 Glass blowers 8 — 2 10 Jewellers 35 3 12 50 Leather goods makers 5 1 3 9 Metalworkers 8 — 4 12 Tailors 26 3 51 80 25 Factories. These visits also afforded an opportunity for extending and revising information relating to "factories" in the Borough. At the end of the year 501 factories were on the register. Workshops are automatically converted, at a very small cost, into factories by the installation of a small electric motor ; the health conditions then may no longer be inspected by the Borough Council's staff except as regards sanitary accommodation. The 501 factories include 57 different industries. In 247 cases men only were employed, in 16 women only, and in 238 both sexes. The more important industries carried on in these factories are:— Printing - 130 Engineering 43 Jewellers' work 33 Bookbinding 17 Metal work 12 Factory and Workshop Inspection—Summary.

There are no premises in the Borough on which rag flock, as defined by the Public Health (London) Act, 1986, is known to be manufactured, used or sold. The Shops Act, 1934. During the year 44 inspections were made under this Act; in 12 cases it was found that the requirements respecting ventilation, heating, or the provision of sanitary conveniences were not complied with. In all cases the attention of owners and occupiers was called to the matter and the necessary steps taken to effect compliance with the requirements of the Act. No applications from owners or occupiers for certificates of exemption under Section 10 of the Act (provision of sanitary conveniences) were received during the year. Inspection of Private Swimming Baths. In conjunction with the Baths Manager-Engineer the customary inspection was made of the private swimming baths at the Y.M.C.A. Central Club, Great Russell Street, and Messrs. Bourne and Hollingsworth's, Warwickshire House, Cower Street, 27 In both of these baths, the condition of the water was found to be satisfactory, and the purification plants to be working efficiently. The auxiliary hygienic measures were also satisfactory. Advice to the operators responsible for maintaining the desirable standard of purity and hygiene in the Borough's Private Bathing establishments is given by the Baths Department, as and when required.

No. of cases of overcrowding on record on 1st January 629 No. of new cases of overcrowding recorded during the year 104 733 * One other house was demolished, pursuant to a Demolition Order, early in 1938. †In addition, undertakings as to future use of, or the execution of works to, dwellinghouses were accepted in five cases. ‡In addition, an undertaking as to the future use of, and the execution of works to a part of a building was accepted in one case. 29 No. of cases of overcrowding abated during the year:— Survey cases 315 Other 34 — 349 No. of cases of overcrowding remaining on record at 31st December 384 Housing Act, 1936. Part IV.—Abatement of Overcrowding. Fixing of Appointed Days. The Housing Act, 1936 (Operation of Overcrowding Provisions) Order (No. 2), 1937, fixed the appointed day for Holborn for the purposes of Section 62 of the Act (entries in rent books, etc.) as 1st July. 1937, and for the purposes of Sections 59 and 64 (offences in relation to overcrowding) and Sections 60 and 6 (2) of the Act, as 1st January 1938. Agreement with London County Council for the Provision of Housing Accommodation. On the 29th October, 1937, the Council decided to enter into an agreement with the London County Council, whereby 50 flats at Walker House on the London County Council Ossulston Estate were placed at the disposal of the Council for the rehousing of overcrowded families. The Council in return agreed to pay £1. 17s. 6d. per annum for forty years in respect of each dwelling provided under the arrangement. Particulars of the flats forming the subject of the agreement are given below:— No. of flats. Size. Inclusive weekly rents. 4 2 rooms 11s. 2d. to 12s. 2d. 26 3 „ 13s. 5d. to 15s. 5d. 17 4 „ 16s. 2d. to 17s. 1d. 3 5 ,, 18s. 11d. to 19s. 3d. The flats were fully let early in 1938 and a noteworthy fact is that in letting them, the Council was able to reduce the number of overcrowded families living in its own flats at Betterton House and Boswell House from 24 to 9. The number of cases of overcrowding abated during the year were recorded as having been dealt with in the following manner:— Accommodation provided by London County Council 81 Accommodation provided by Borough Council 5 Accommodation secured otherwise 190 Abatement by alteration in constitution of family 73 349 30 Rehousing. The Council continued to take advantage of the agreement with the London County Council for the provision of rehousing accommodation for families displaced by this Council's operations under the Housing Act, 1936. During the year 29 cases were approved by the Council for inclusion in the agreement and of these, 18 families had been rehoused by the end of the year. Housing Act, 1936, Section 18. Allowances towards Removal Expenses. During the year the Council made allowances towards the cost of removal of families displaced in consequence of action taken by the Council under Part II of the Housing Act, 1936. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops. In connection with the duties imposed on the Council respecting registration of milkshops, opportunity is taken before entering the premises or the name of the applicant on the register to inspect the premises proposed to be used, to ascertain whether they are suitable for the sale of milk. From time to time it has been necessary to postpone registration pending the completion of works found to be required. At the end of the year 1937, the number of registered dairies and milkshops in the Borough was 159. Twenty-nine entries were made in the register during 1937. Of these, 3 were cases where a change of occupier had necessitated re-registration, and 26 were new registrations, 4 being itinerant vendors with premises outside the Borough. The Sanitary Inspectors recorded 336 inspections of milk premises. It was not necessary to serve notice for any breach of the Order or sanitary defect. The Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1936. During the year 1937 licences available up to the 31st December, 1937, for the sale of designated milk in the Borough were issued as follows:— Accredited — Tuberculin Tested 3 Pasteurised 10 Supplementary— Accredited — Tuberculin Tested 2 Pasyeurised 4 19 31 Bacteriological Examinations of Milk. The following table shows the results of examinations in 1937:— Nature of premises where sample obtained Grade No. of bacteria per c.c.

None GCC These results show the existence of a higher quality in milk which has been pasteurised as compared with that which is ungraded. Pasteurisation was, in each case, carried out outside this Borough. In the instances in which pasteurised milk failed to reach the official standard, information was sent to the Local Authorities which had issued the licence for the pasteurising plant. In all cases where the results suggested the possibility of contamination appropriate action was taken. It is satisfactory to note that none of the samples gave evidence of infection with tubercle bacilli. Margarine. There are eight registered wholesale dealers in the Borough. Bakehouses. At the end of the year 1937 there were 19 bakehouses in the Borough of which 12 were factory bakehouses. Although these are described as " factories " they are not large and only supply local needs; a number were formerly workshops and are now classified as " factories " owing to the installation of machinery. Sale of Fish. The necessary routine inspections were made of the fish shops and fish stalls in the Borough in addition to market street inspections. There are 14 fish shops, of which eight are in the Central Fish Market (a part of the Smithfield Central Markets, Farringdon Road, the fish being sold by retail). Both wet and dried fish are sold at all the shops; at five, shell fish also is sold. In addition to the shops referred to above, there are eight stalls in the Borough for the general sale of fish. There is also a shop in the Borough for the sale of shell fish only and two for the sale of stewed eels. These premises were also kept under observation. Fried Fish Shops. There are also 15 fried fish shops. These are inspected to see that they are kept in conformity with the By-laws made by the London County Council. 33 Market Streets. There were 263 inspections of market streets, each of which includes a number of stalls at which meat, fish, fruit and vegetables are sold. These streets are regularly inspected, including Saturday evening inspections. In order to minimise as far as practicable any contamination of the food exposed for sale in market streets from dust arising during street cleansing, the Borough Surveyor has arranged for these streets to be sufficiently watered before the scavenging. Street Trading. I received information from the Borough Engineer respecting 84 applications from street traders for annual licences to sell various articles of food as follows: — Coffee stalls 5 Confectionery and drinks 11 Fish—wet and dry, including shell fish 7 Fruit and vegetables 43 Groceries 2 Ice cream or chestnuts 10 Meat 4 Poultry, eggs and provisions 2 84 All the storage places situated in the Borough were inspected. Where the storage place is outside the Borough information as to suitability is obtained from the Medical Officer of Health of the district concerned. In like manner information respecting storage places in Holborn used by stallholders trading in other areas is sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the licence is applied for. Ice Cream. At the end of the year the following premises were on the register: — Manufacture and sale 1 Manufacture, storage and sale 7 Storage and sale 35 Sale only 27 70 E 34 In addition to my inspections, 74 inspections of these premises were made. Where ice cream sold in the Borough is made at premises outside Holborn, it is the practice to ask for information as to the conditions of manufacture from the Medical Officer of Health of the area concerned. On the other hand, we receive a number of such enquiries from other districts respecting ice cream made in Holborn and sold in other districts. Bacteriological Examinations of Ice Cream. The following table shows the results of examination in 1937: — Sample letter Description Nature of premises where sample obtained No. of bacteria per c.c.

Remarks.—The examinations have shewn considerable variations in quality of ice cream. Continuous attention is given to the subject by the Council's Food Inspector with a view to improving conditions. Careful consideration is also given to the premises concerned when applications are made for new licences. 35 Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924. The following summary shows the number of butchers' shops and meat stalls in the Borough, and the number of other shops where meat is sold: — Butchers' shops 27 Butchers' stalls 1 Provision dealers 35 Provision dealers' stalls 3 Offal shops 2 Cooked meats 19 Wholesale (bacon; sausage) 5 92 All the butchers' shops and meat stalls in the Borough are regularly inspected to ensure compliance with the Regulations; during the year 252 such inspections were made. Places where Food is prepared for Sale. Under this head are included kitchens of hotels, restaurants, and eating-houses of all sorts, slaughter-houses, tripe, offal and other meat shops, fried fish, eel and other fish shops, premises where ice cream is made, and other places where food is prepared for sale excluding bakehouses. The number of such places on the register at the end of the year was as follows: — Hotels, Restaurants and Eating Houses 521 Slaughter-houses 1 Tripe, offal and other meat shops 47 Fried fish shops 15 Fish shops 14 Ice cream (Manufacture) 8 Poulterers 8 During the year 1,894 inspections of such food premises and market streets were made and 8 notices served for sanitary defects found. Inspection of Restaurant Kitchens. The large day population in the Borough calls for many eating houses ranging from the " cook shop " to the high-class restaurant. The inspection of the kitchens of such places has become a routine but important part of the work of the Public Health Department. Generally the kitchens are found to be satisfactory and the food clean and wholesome. Occasionally, however some action is necessary to ensure compliance with a reasonable standard of efficiency. e2 36 Unsound Food. The following unsound food was condemned during the year 1937:— Cert.

Total 222 217 5 F 42 Report of Borough Analyst for Year 1937. During the year 1937 , 600 samples were submitted to me for analysis in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs (Adulteration) Act, 1928, 378 having been purchased with the required formalities and 222 informally. Of this total 11 (1.8 per cent.) proved to be adulterated, six being samples submitted formally and five informally. In the previous year (1936) 2.2 per cent. of the samples were certified to be " not genuine." The adulterated articles consisted of milk, cheese, sardines, sild and whisky. Milk.—Two hundred and twelve samples of milk were submitted for analysis and six of these, 2.8 per cent., fell below the limits required by the Board of Agriculture Regulations—3.0 per cent. of fat and 8.50 per cent. of non-fatty solids -and were accordingly certified to be adulterated. Two of these samples, one purchased formally and one informally, had been diluted with water to the extent of at least 2.2 per cent. and 17.8 per cent. respectively. Four others, all purchased formally, were deficient in fat to the extent of at least 2.6 per cent., 6.6 per cent., 200 per cent. and 43-3 per cent. respectively. Two tables which have been prepared by the Public Health Department from the returns of the Borough Analyst afford valuable information concerning the places from which samples were purchased and the monthly variation in the chemical composition of the milk supply of the Borough.

These figures approximate very closely to those of the previous four years, averages of which are tabulated below:— Year. No. of samples examined Total solids, (average). Fat. (average). Non-fatty solids.

The sample of cheese which was certified to be adulterated was labelled as a f2 44 "Full Cream" cheese and should have contained at least 30.0 per cent. of fat, but on analysis it was found to contain only about half this amount and was therefore certified to be at least 50.0 per cent. deficient in fat. It may be added that many full cream hard cheeses contain much higher percentages of fat than 30 and that the standard taken here may be regarded as almost too low. As is well known, cheese is a most important food and is regarded as one of the staple articles of diet by many members of the community, and therefore unscrupulous vendors who make false statements concerning its quality should be dealt with severely. Sardines.—The sample of sardines found to be adulterated contained 20 parts per million of lead—a dangerous quantity. As I have pointed out in a previous report, these sardines containing lead are mostly packed in Portugal where the fish are submitted to a preliminary process of cooking before canning. This cooking is performed on metal grills which often contain a high percentage of lead, and during the operation the fish tend to absorb that metal in comparatively large quantities. Where this has been found to exceed 20 parts per million, large consignments have been returned by the Dock Authorities to the senders. Until recently sardines which contain less than this amount of lead have been permitted to come into this country, but in July, 1937, the Port Medical Officers decided to limit the quantity to 5 parts per million, and even this amount to be allowed only for a short time, after which the fish should be free from lead or only contain negligible traces. That it is quite possible to obtain this result, is indicated by the number of brands which are on sale in this country, and which are quite satisfactory. Sild.—The sample of this canned fish was found to contain 2.58 grains per pound of tin which appeared to be accidental as other fish of the same brand were free from this metal. Whisky.—Two samples of whisky were found to have been diluted with water so as to reduce the spirit strength to 37.53 and 41.3 degrees under proof respectively. Whisky should not be sold if it is less than 35 degrees under proof without notice being given to the purchaser. Proposed New Legislation.—A Bill has recently been prepared by a Committee to consolidate with amendments certain enactments relating to Food, Drugs, Markets, Slaughter-houses and Knackers' Yards, a draft of which was presented to Parliament by the Ministry of Health in December, 1937. It is still under consideration. Merchandise Marks Act, 1926. The Orders under the above Act now in force provide for the marking of the following imported foodstuffs to show their origin: — 1. Fresh Apples. 2. Raw Tomatoes. 3. Eggs (hen or duck eggs in shell). 4. Dried Eggs. 45 5. Currants, Sultanas and Raisins. 6. Oat Products (oatmeal, rolled oats, oat flour and groats). 7. Honey. 8. Salmon or Sea Trout, frozen or chilled. 9. Butter. 10. Bacon and ham. 11. Dead poultry. 12. Frozen beef, mutton, lamb, pork and veal; chilled beef; salted beef and pork; boneless beef and veal; edible offals. During the year under review daily inspections under the Orders in force were made by the Inspector appointed for the purposes of the Act; no breaches were found. Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 187. Registration of Food Premises. At the date of the preparation, of this report 44 premises were registered in accordance with the requirements of the Act, for the purposes shown below:— Sausages 16 Preserved meat 21 Pickled meat 6 Preserved fish 1 All the premises concerned were carefully inspected prior to registration. Notification of Food Poisoning. During the year 1937 five cases of food poisoning were notified. In three cases the poisoning was due to tinned salmon purchased at a retailer's shop in the Borough. The premises occupied by the retailer, and the food stored or exposed for sale, were carefully inspected. In one case the poisoning was stated to be due to the patient partaking of a quantity of ham at the address of a friend in another Borough. The friend also suffered from food poisoning. All the patients recovered. The remaining case was alleged to be due to tinned pilchards. No information was obtained in this case. On visiting the address of the patient it was found that she had returned to work. Information on all notified cases of food poisoning in the County of London is distributed to Medical Officers of Health by the County Medical Officer. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933. One application was received and granted for renewal of a licence to slaughter under Section 3 of the Act. Prevalence of, and Control over Infectious Diseases, including Tuberculosis. The total number of notifications relating to Holborn residents received during the year was 321 in comparison with 369 in the year 1936. 46 The following are the principal variations: — Scarlet Fever 38 in comparison with 67 in 1936. Tuberculosis 76 ,, ,, 90 „ Whooping Cough 60 „ ,, 76 „ Diphtheria 76 „ ,, 60 ,, A special reference card with complete list of notifiable diseases is supplied to all doctors practising in the Borough. In addition to the above we received 245 notifications respecting patient not residing in Holborn, many being in-patients of hospitals in the Borough. All these were to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts concerned. The diseases notified were :— Chicken-pox — Diphtheria 70 Erysipelas 2 Measles 7 Scarlet Fever 29 Tuberculosis 52 Whooping Cough 10 Pneumonia 4 icute Poliomyelitis 24 Encephalitis Lethargica 2 Dysentery 28 Mumps 11 Para-typhoid 1 Undulant Fever 2 Rheumatic Fever 1 Cerebro-Spinal Fever 2 245 Smallpox. No case of smallpox occurred in a Holborn resident during the year 1937. Vaccination. The following table gives information respecting the vaccination of Holborn children during the year ended 30th June, 1937: — Total Number of Births Vaccinated Died before Vaccination Cons.

No opportunity is lost of speaking about the vital importance of vaccination whether for the baby or for the older person. 47 Diphtheria. We received notifications relating to 76 cases of diphtheria occurring in residents in the Borough. All were removed to hospital.

In London, 7,903 cases were notified, giving rise to 210 deaths. There is co-operation with the Medical Superintendents of the Fever Hospitals serving the County of London; and information is exchanged as to bacteriological and other details; and also with regard to return cases of diphtheria or scarlet fever. Diphtheria in Hospitals. Information was received of 55 cases of diphtheria occurring among inpatients and staff at two hospitals in the Borough. The information was obtained from the notifications of removal received from the London County Council, or from the ordinary notification certificates furnished by the doctors diagnosing the disease. Of the 55 cases, 50 were clinical cases (25 were notified as " nasal "). Of the total number, seven notifications related to Holborn residents, six being members of the resident medical or nursing staff. Forty-eight were in-patients admitted from areas outside the Halborn Borough. Copies of the notifications of these cases if sent to the Holborn Public Health Department are forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts from which the patients are admitted, 48 Diphtheria in Hospitals.

The Schick Test and Immunisation against Diphtheria. This work has been carried on since 1922 at the Council's Maternity and Child Welfare Centre, 10, John Street, on Wednesday afternoons. Enquiries as to the effect of the testing and inoculation on the individual were made as a routine. We are able to record that any disturbance caused was negligible. The prophylactics used are toxoid antitoxin for children, and toxoid antitoxin floccules (suspension) for adults. 158 persons attended this clinic during 1937, making a total of 2,812 since 1922, Of the 158 (104 children and 54 adults) 88 children, nearly all of whom were under five years, were inoculated without preliminary Schick test. Schick Testing. Sixteen children (mostly over five years) were tested, of whom— 11 gave a positive reaction to the test. 5 gave a negative reaction. Fifty-four adults (over fifteen years) were tested, of whom— 34 gave a positive reaction to the test. 20 gave a negative reaction. Immunisation. One hundred and twenty-nine persons (95 children and 34 adults) received inoculation. Of these, 120 completed the routine course, while 9 (8 children and 1 adult) failed to complete. Re-Schick Testing. One hundred and eight persons were tested two months or more after completion of the course. These included 43 who attended prior to 1937. Ninety-four were children and 14 were adults— 90 children gave a negative reaction to retest. 4 children gave a positive reaction. These 4 received further inoculations and 3 have been found negative to the retest. Fourteen adults were negative to the retest, and 2 were positive. 49 Age groups of 158 persons attending during 1937.

The arrangements made in June, 1930, with the authorities of the London Homœopathic Hospital for the Medical Officer of the Council's Immunisation Clinic to Schick test and immunise the nursing staff were continued during 1937. At this hospital Schick testing of all newcomers and immunisation of positives is now customary. From June, 1930, till the end of December, 1937, 220 nurses were tested; 16 of these were tested for the first time in 1937, 10 being positive and 6 negative. Ten positive cases were inoculated. Immunisation of School Children. Attendances of London public elementary school children to be immunised against diphtheria at Municipal Centres arc now allowed to count as attendances at school. Scarlet Fever. There were 38 notifications of scarlet fever. Thirty-six were removed to hospital. Three of these were returned from hospital diagnosed as not suffering from this disease. From one hospital in the Borough 22 in-patients were notified as so suffering; one was resident in Holborn. There were no "return" cases of scarlet fever, i.e., secondary cases occurring after the return home of the primary case. Six notifications of " secondary " cases were received. There was one death from this disease. 8,551 cases of scarlet fever were notified in London with 33 deaths. Acute Rheumatism in Children. The Holborn (Acute Rheumatism) Regulations of 1929 came into force on the 1st April, 1929; these required the notification of acute rheumatism in children up to the age of sixteen years. The regulations were superseded from the 1st January, 1933, by the Holborn (Acute Rheumatism) Regulations, 1932, which have been extended to the 31st December, 1938, by the Holborn (Acute Rheumatism) Regulations, 1935, dated 10th December, 1935. Acute rheumatism as defined by the Regulations means:— (i) Rheumatic pain or arthritis, if accompanied by a rise in temperature; (ii) Rheumatic chorea (St. Vitus' dance); (iii) Rheumatic carditis. Information of ten cases was received in 1937. G 2 52 Aye and Sex Distribution oj notified cases. Sex Age in years. M. F.

Enquiries in Notified Cases of Rheumatism. Enquiries into the housing conditions of the notified cases showed that 2 lived in satisfactory self-contained flats; 3 lived in a satisfactory home, a divided house of a com fortable type (a house let in lodgings); 5 lived in houses let in lodgings. No signs of dampness were found in any of the houses and the lighting and ventilation were not unsatisfactory. Overcrowding. There was no overcrowding within the meaning of the Housing Act, 1936. Sleeping Arrangements. Four children had separate beds, in rooms shared with a child or children. In six cases a child shared a bed, in a room occupied by one or more others. Social Conditions. In four homes the circumstances were such that there was a constant struggle against poverty. Value of Notification of Rheumatism in Children. The periodic visiting which follows upon notification enables the health visitor to bring home to the parents the need of special care for the child and of giving consideration to his future welfare. Without such visiting, the poor health of the child might be accepted as inevitable and no special effort made to secure for him the best conditions within the reach of the parents. Contacts. The names of all contacts going to school were passed on by the London County Council district organiser to the Divisional School Medical Officer in order that they might be observed and examined if necessary. Holidays for Rheumatic Children. An annual holiday in the country or by the sea is of benefit to all children; it is even more necessary for children who are handicapped by rheumatism. Co-operation with the school organisation was continued, and in nearly every case a holiday was arranged for each child who was physically fit for a holiday home, special arrangements being made for those attending schools for the physically defective. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever. Enteric Fever. No notifications were received of Holborn residents suffering from enteric fever. 53 Typhus Fever. No case of typhus fever was notified in the Borough during the year. Cerebro-Spinal Fever. One case of cerebro-spinal fever was notified in the Borough. Dysentery. Bacillary. One case of Flexner or Shiga type was notified. There were nine cases of Sonne Dysentery. The patients in four cases were nurses in the ward of a hospital where there were several cases. The source of the infection was not traced. Three cases also occurred in hospital; and in this instance also the source of infection was not discovered; two occurred in private houses. Malaria. Three cases of malaria were notified. Encephalitis Lethargica. No case of encephalitis lethargica was notified in the Borough during the year. Acute Poliomyelitis and Acute Polioencephalitis. No case of these diseases was notified as occurring in the Borough during 1937. Pneumonia. Thirty-four cases of pneumonia were notified during the year. Fifteen of these were influenzal pneumonia. Five deaths were recorded from all forms of pneumonia. The 19 cases of primary pneumonia were notified at the following ages:—From 1 to 5 years, 3; from 5 to 15 years, 2; from 15 to 35 years, 4; from 35 to 45 years, 3; from 45 to 65 years, 5; and 65 years and upwards, 2. Six were treated at home; 5 were removed to L.C.C. hospitals; 3 to voluntary hospitals. Throe of the patients were nursed by the Metropolitan Nursing Association, under the arrangements made by the Council. Eighty-six visits were made to these patients—all recovered. Influenza. There were 10 deaths (4 males, 6 females) from influenza, in comparison with 2 in 1936, 3 in 1935, 3 in 1934, 25 in 1933, 12 in 1932, 13 in 1931, 1 in 1930, 44 in 1929, 3 in 1928, 20 in 1927, 8 in 1926, 9 in 1925, and 11 in 1924. Anthrax. No case of anthrax was notified in the Borough during the year. Chicken-pox. This disease is not notifiable, but during the year 1937 we received information of 28 cases. These were visited and where necessary kept under observation. Mumps. Information was received from school teachers and others of 24 cases of mumps. 54 Bacteriological Work. The following table gives details of the examinations made during the year:— Diphtheria Pulmonary Tuberculosis Other Diseases Number Submitted Result of Examination Number Submitted Result of Examination Number Submitted Result of Examination. 357 Bacilli not found 32 62 Bacilli not found 51 7 Negative 5 Diphtheria Bacilli found 38 Vincent's Bacilli found 8 Positive 2 organisms found 3 Disinfections. During the year 434 rooms and 4,936 articles of bedding, clothing, etc., were disinfected after various infectious diseases, inclusive of tuberculosis. Twenty-five rooms and 257 articles of bedding, clothing, etc., were disinfected on account of tuberculosis. Special attention is devoted to toys and more particularly to any toy put in the mouth. One hundred and thirty books and 125 toys were disinfected. The disinfections also included 1 locker and 1 hospital ward. Cleansing of Persons Act. During the year 102 persons (98 men and 4 women) infested with vermin had their bodies and 1,039 articles of clothing disinfected, free of charge, at our cleansing station (Goldsmith Street). Shelter during Disinfection. For some years past an arrangement has been in operation with the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury for accommodation to be provided at their Reception House, Northampton Road, for residents of this Borough during the disinfection of their homes after infectious disease. In the year 1937 the accommodation was used by four Holborn families comprising seven persons. Extermination of Vermin. The number of Council dwellings found to be infested with vermin was 22 and the number of other dwellings 46; all these were disinfested. The total number of rooms disinfested was 137. This work was carried out by the Council's staff. In dealing with verminous rooms, the fumigation is repeated, whenever practicable, at the end of twelve to sixteen days, by which time it is expected that any eggs of bugs will have hatched out; a single fumigation of any severely infested room cannot be regarded as satisfactory. In 73 cases last year this second fumigation was carried out. When this course was for any reason impracticable, the occupiers of the rooms were advised to use a disinfecting spray, and to take such other measures as appeared likely to prevent recurrence of the infestation. 55 From time to time in recent years it has become necessary to deal with vermin infestation in new or comparatively new dwellings. It is found that usually the infestation arises from infested furniture brought by the incoming tenants into the new dwellings from verminous rooms formerly occupied by them. To prevent risk of such infestation, particularly in regard to new occupations of municipal dwellings, arrangements have been made for furniture disinfestation by the hydrocyanic gas method. This has been made practicable by an agreement with the Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington. The procedure is that the infested furniture is removed in the morning in a special type van and after disinfestation is delivered in the evening of the same day at the new home. The bedding is collected by the Council's staff treated in the steam disinfector and delivered at the new home at approximately the same time as the furniture. A leaflet on the subject of vermin infestation is distributed to tenants, setting out the steps which should be taken to deal with bugs, and giving emphatic warning against the use of second-hand furniture before it has been inspected by the Council's staff and any necessary disinfestation carried out. Cancer. During the year 1937, 66 deaths were recorded as due to Cancer in comparison with 67 in the previous year. The deaths in 1937 were equal to a rate of 1.81 per thousand, the corresponding rate in 1936 being 1.93 per thousand. Tuberculosis. Summary of Notifications and Deaths.

Excluding duplicates the total number of notifications received on Forms A or B during the year 1937 was 58. Eighteen other cases were brought to my knowledge by other means, making 76 new cases in the year. These were:— Private cases 7, hospital cases 40, Public Assistance cases 11, from death returns 8, transfer from other districts 9, posthumous notification 1. Of the 76 cases entered on the Register in 1987, 66 were pulmonary tuberculosis and 10 non-pulmonary tuberculosis. Fifty-eight of the cases were removed for treatment to hospitals, sanatoria, &c. Classification of Homes. The classification of homes as suggested by the London County Council has been reported on as far as practicable with the following results:— "A."—Good environment, clean, well-kept, separate bedroom (or in the case of husband and wife, no other occupant of bedroom), good food and clothing 26 " B "—Fair. Separate bed, but not separate bedroom 20 " C."—Bad. Dirty environment, dirty iil-kept home, no separate bed, bad management as to food and clothing — 46 Non-attendance at Tuberculosis Dispensary. Twenty-nine of the 76 cases attended the Holborn Tuberculosis Dispensary. The following indicates the reasons for non-attendance in the remaining cases:— Removed to Hospitals, etc., for treatment without prior attendance at Dispensary 24 Dead before or soon after notification 11 Treatment at home by private doctor 1 Not traced and common lodging house cases 2 Removed from Borough 7 No information 2 Notification withdrawn — 47 59 Institutional Treatment. During the year notifications were received of 99 admissions to institutions, These admissions represent 73 patients, some of whom were transferred from one institution to another, and others were discharged, or took their own discharge, and subsequently were readmitted. The admissions were to the following institutions:— Institutions of the London County Council 65 Other institutions 34 Visits to Homes, etc. During 1937 the Tuberculosis Officer made 30 visits to the homes of patients. The general visitation of the patients and supervision of home conditions is carried out by the Tuberculosis Nurse who made 985 visits. The advice given by the Tuberculosis Nurse includes suggestions respecting food and cooking and suitable cookery books are supplied free of charge when required. Contacts. All contacts are urged to attend for examination at the Tuberculosis Dispensary. Thirty-three contacts, viz., 15 adults and 18 children under fifteen years of age, were examined for the first time during the year 1937. Of these, three adults and two children were found to be definitely suffering from tuberculosis. Twenty-eight were definitely diagnosed as not suffering from the disease. The routine examination of contacts is desirable as a means of discovering not only cases of tuberculosis in early stages of infection but even definitely infective cases which may be disseminating infection although remaining undiscovered and untreated. Arrangements were continued during the year for co-operation with the school medical service to ensure that no contacts of school age remain unexamined; if such examination cannot be carried out at the Dispensary the School Medical Officers are notified so that the examination may be carried out at the school. Information as to the results of such examinations, whether at the Dispensary or the schools, is interchanged as necessary. H 2 60 Tuberculosis Dispensary.

Report for 1937. The Committee has met four times during the year; in January, April, July and October. The Committee is composed of 23 members; there is one vacancy. The average attendance of members at each meeting has been 6.25. Sixty-five cases have been brought to the notice of the Committee during the year—35 new cases (32 adults and 3 children) and 30 old cases (28 adults and 2 children). Sixty-six adults and four children were admitted to Institutions for treatment. One adult refused to accept treatment and 11 took their discharge before the completion of treatment. One of the latter arrived at the Town Hall about mid-day on Christmas Eve, with 4d. in cash and her luggage, having no where to go. Arrangements were made for her immediate admission to a General Hospital. Two children were boarded out, under the Council's Contact Scheme, to enable their mother to accept treatment. Seventeen Progress Reports, on eight children, were received from the Council; and the information contained therein was conveyed to the parents. One child was admitted to the Council's Open Air School, on the recommendation of the Tuberculosis Officer. During the year 569 visits have been paid to patients or their relatives, and many other calls have been made in connection with matters connected with their welfare. Convalescence was arranged for four children through the Invalid Children's Aid Association, and for two adults through Stafford's Charity. Holidays were arranged for two children and one adult. Five cases were referred for the provision of dentures. In one instance the patient paid the full cost by instalments. Another patient was assisted with a grant from the Society for the Relief of Distress. The other three patients 63 received grants from their Approved Societies; one paid the balance of the cost by instalments; one was granted the balance of the cost by the Officers' Association, and the other received a grant from the National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis. Various applications for assistance with clothing were dealt with through the United Services Fund and British Legion Benevolent Fund, the British Bed Cross Society, and the London County Council. Fifteen patients known to the Committee have died during the year; 13 in Institutions and two at home. Thirty cases have left the Borough, to our knowledge, during the year. There are always a number of " birds of passage " in Central London—hotel staff, domestic workers, men and women drifting to town in search of work, frequenters of common lodging houses, etc., and Holborn has its full share of these. They cannot return to their former employment (if they had any) and do not return to the Borough. Fifteen families moved away to better accommodation and, of these, five moved to the Ossulston Street Estate under the Borough Council's Scheme for the abatement of overcrowding. We know of over a dozen families that are still on the waiting list for better housing accommodation. We again tender our sincere thanks to Alderman Mullen for his generous gift of coal at Christmas time, and to Councillor Bailey for arranging for its distribution; to Councillor Wheatley and the London Philanthropic Society for their gifts of coal and milk tickets, which are so much appreciated; to Alderman Bristow for his equally welcome gift of grocery tickets; to His Worship the Mayor and all those whose donations made it possible for us to obtain Christmas Dinners for 47 families, through the Polytechnic Distress and Christmas Dinner Fund; and to all those who have helped us, in any way, to ameliorate the lives of those with whom we come in contact. Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925. It was not necessary to take any action under the above Regulations during the year 1937. Home Nursing for Tuberculous Patients. It was necessary during the year 1037 for only two tuberculous patients to be nursed under the arrangements made by the Council with the Metropolitan District Nursing Association; 104 visits were made to these patients before their death. Dental Clinic for Tuberculous Persons. Arrangements were continued for tuberculous persons referred from the Tuberculosis Dispensary to receive dental treatment as part of the Council's Tuberculosis Dispensary Scheme, at the Clinic of the British Dental Hospital, No. 10. John Street, W.C. Particulars of this service are given in the table below (General Dental Clinic). The Clinic is held by the British Dental Hospital at the Council's Maternity Centre, 10, John Street, on Tuesday evenings. 64 Extra Nourishment for Tuberculous Persons. During the year 1936 the Council approved a scheme for the supply of extra nourishment for necessitous tuberculous patients residing in the Borough. The scheme was prepared under the Public Health (Prevention of Disease) Act, 1913, which gives power to local authorities, subject to the approval of the Minister of Health, to supply such extra nourishment. A circular issued by the Ministry of Health specified the type of cases which the Minister considered could be suitably dealt with by such grants, viz.:— (i) Ex-sanatorium cases, where the medical condition is such that a grant of extra nourishment is necessary to enable the patient to maintain or recover full working capacity, and (ii) Patients with prospects of ultimate recovery of the disease who are waiting admission to sanatorium. A scheme on these lines was submitted to, and sanctioned by, the Minister of Health on the 16th May, 1936, and thereupon became operative in the Borough. Grants made during 1937, four. General Dental Clinic. By arrangement with the British Dental Hospital, a Dental Clinic open for inhabitants and workers in the neighbourhood is held on Tuesday evenings at the Council's Maternity and Child Welfare Centre, No. 10, John Street. Tuberculous patients are also seen at the Tuesday evening Clinic by appointment at times outside the hours for the general public. The Secretary of the Hospital has kindly supplied the following information of the work at the Clinic during the year 1937:— Summary of Work carried out at Dental Clinic, 10, John Street, llolborn, on Tuesday Evenings, duritiq 1937.

Home Visiting. The visits paid to the homes by the Health Visitors during the year were as follows:— First Visits. Revisits. Total. Expectant Mothers 194 266 460 Post-natal Mothers 6 9 15 Children under 1 year of age 311 698 1,009 Children 1 to 2 years of age 17 344 361 Children over 1 years of age 46 778 824 Enquiries re stillbirths 12 „ re ophthalmia neonatorum 5 Other visits 230 Two hundred and eighty-eight visits related to infants who came under further observation in their own homes or at Infant Welfare Centres; of this number 223 were recorded as attending a Centre, i.e., 77.4 per cent. Thus nearly five-sixths of those visited attended an Infant Welfare Centre and of these 87-4 per cent, attended at the Council s Centres. Attendances at Infant Welfare Centres.

At the Holborn Centre, No. 10, John Street, 4,892 attendances were made by 298 mothers and expectant mothers; and 462 children of whom 218 were under one year, 77 between one and two years old, and 167 aged 2-5 years on the date of their first attendance. At the St. Giles' Centre, Short's Gardens, 932 attendances were made by 47 mothers and 104 children, of whom 63 were under one year, 10 from one to two years and 31 between two and five years. Ante-natal Hygiene. Under the scheme for the voluntary notification of pregnancy which came into force in January, 1928, 40 voluntary notifications were received during 1937 as compared with 51 in 1936. All these expectant mothers, as well as those already known to the Health Visitors through other sources, were visited in their homes and informed, both verbally and by means of a leaflet, of the special facilities available in Holborn; they also received instruction in the hygiene of pregnancy, and if not already in attendance at an ante-natal centre they were advised to attend, 67 Confinement in Institutions in Relation to Housing Conditions. Expectant mothers whose home circumstances make confinement at home especially undesirable are advised to enter hospital for confinement. In order to provide accommodation for those who are willing to take this advice an arrangement has been made with one of the principal Maternity Hospitals within reach of Holborn to accept normal cases on domestic grounds only. Special records have been kept of the home conditions of 168 expectant mothers visited during 1937, each case being followed up either to a successful issue or until it became clear that the woman would not enter hospital. Of the 116 who went into hospital:— 17 (7 primigravidse) lived in a one-room home; 99 (60 primigravidse) lived in a two or more roomed home. Of the 52 who remained at home :— 4 (3 primigravidse) lived in a one-roomed home; 29 (5 primigravidse) lived in two rooms; 19 lived in three or more rooms. Baths. The baths provided at the John Street Centre for expectant and nursing mothers were used 179 times during the year 1937. Ante-natal Centres. During the year, enquiries were made of mothers as to their attendance at an Ante-natal Centre immediately previous to the birth of the child visited. Of '294 mothers, about whom information was obtained, 257 (87 per cent.) were found to have attended Ante-natal Centres or received ante-natal care as under:— Number of enquiries made 304 Centre Attended:— Holborn Centre, 10, John Street 14 Holborn Centre, Short's Gardens 11 Royal Free Hospital 19 Middlesex Hospital 11 Charing Cross Hospital 31 University College Hospital 33 Myddelton Square Institution 17 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 24 City of London Hospital 29 Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital 1 St. Pancras Hospital 19 Other Centres 24 Ante-natal care from private doctors 21 Private midwives 3 257 12 68 Nature of defects found at Municipal Centres. 10, John Street, Holborn.

Seventeen attended the post-natal consultations at the Centre, 10, John Street. They made 56 attendances in all. The conditions found included three cases of prolapse of uterus, two cases of retroverted uterus, two cases of leucorrhœa, and three of cervicitis. Post-natal consultations were attended at the hospitals where the mothers were confined. Instruction in Mothercraft and Hygiene. For some years, both in the home and in the Centres, use has been made of leaflets written in non-technical language dealing with the hygiene of infancy and maternity; and the walls of the Centres have been hung with instructive posters to give point to the teaching and to draw attention to the series of leaflets. Propaganda posters are pasted on the outer walls at the Centres. There is also a glass-fronted case for the display of a special poster; this poster is changed frequently. Miss Mary Carter and Miss Edith Joyce have continued to give us a great deal of valuable assistance during the year by making children's garments for busy 69 mothers from materials supplied by the mothers and from their own resources. Mrs. Lauder Eaton has also given assistance at the Centre regularly on Wednesdays for many months. Assistance is given at the Centres in cutting out garments at any time; patterns of the most suitable woven garments are given away, also directions for making knitted garments and advice as to the choice of suitable materials. A sewing machine is available for use of the mothers at 10, John Street, and instruction in its use is given as required. Up-to-date model garments for babies and young children are always on view at the Centres. One hundred and twelve hanks of wool of a special quality were sold at cost price to the value of £5. 2s. 5d. Maternity outfits are placed on sale at the Centre at cost price, 5s. lOd. Two outfits were sold. Maternal and Infant Consultations.

Number referred to Metropolitan Nursing Association 8 — Results:— — Breast sccrction re-established 4 — Small bottle feeds required in addition to breast feeding 3 — Massage unsuccessful 1 — Pre-School Children, 1937. During the year 1937, of all the children of pre-school age who attended the John Street Clinics, only twelve were found to be much below the normal weight for their respective ages. Dental caries was discovered in fifty-five cases, all of whom were referred to a dental clinic. During the winter months thirty-eight children suffered from colds and coughs while nine had bronchitis. There were six cases of enlarged cervical glands, one abcess in the neck, six of tonsilitis, while one child had adenoids, and ten had enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Where necessary, the children were referred to hospital, and seven underwent operation with beneficial results. The most frequent skin trouble was lichen urticatus, of which there were nineteen cases, some of them apparently due to over-indulgence in sweets. Fourchildren had impetigo, one intertrigo, five septic spots, and three had recurring boils. There were four cases of eczema, two of burns, and one case of scabies. All these were treated at the Minor Ailments Clinic. 71 Twenty children suffered from chronic constipation, six had diarrhoea: while there was one case each of diarrhoea and vomiting, cyclic vomiting and of coeliac disease. Six children were referred to hospital or were treated by the district nurse for intestinal worms. There was one case of pruritis ani which responded rapidly to treatment. References to the Tavistock Clinic included three cases of night terrors; one of bad temper; one of vomiting during school time; three of enuresis and two of nail biting. There was one case of stuttering; and two were found to be mentally defective Four children were referred to hospital for heart bruits and three for endocrine disorders—two being hypopituitary cases and one of undescended testicles. Fifteen cases of rickets were diagnosed, including six of knock-knees and three of abnormally curved tibiae. One child with congenital dislocation of the hip was referred to hospital. Of eye disorders there were five cases of strabismus which were referred to hospital for lenses; four children were treated at the Centre for blepharitis; five for styes, and four for conjunctivitis. Thirteen cases of earache occurred— with or without discharge—and were treated at the Minor Ailment Centre, if mild, or referred to hospital if severe. Anfeinia was suspected in eight children; and ten were referred for Sun Ray Treatment with great benefit to those who kept up their attendances. Foundling Hospital Day Nursery. The establishment of a day nursery and play centre for children at Coram Fields (Foundling Hospital Site) has been referred to in previous Annual Reports. These activities were maintained during 1937. The number of children from Holborn attending this day nursery is evidence of the need of such facilities in its immediate neighbourhood, and the Council decided again to make a contribution (£100) towards the cost incurred in connection with Holborn children. School Entrants. During the year information was received from the London County Council that 67 children living in Holborn had been entered as attending school for the first time. Particulars of the children's pre-school physical history and their records of attendance at an Infant Welfare Centre were forwarded to the head teacher of the infants department of the school concerned. This information is set out on a form supplied by the London County Council and is intended for the use of the School Medical Officer when examining school entrants. Notice of attendance at school has brought to our knowledge families hitherto unknown to us, having recently entered the Borough. This knowledge has been very useful in connection with Maternity and Child Welfare Work generally. 72 Stillbirths. During 1937 information was received of 10 stillbirths. 6 of which were legitimate. Enquiry as to possible causes was made in nine cases, the tenth child was found abandoned in the street. In nine instances the confinement took place in hospital. Difficult labour was responsible for two; craniotomy of a hydrocephalic child was responsible for one; in two cases there was a history of toxaemia of pregnancy; in two sases no definite reason could be assigned; in two others no information was obtainable, the mother not having returned to the address given on admission. Illegitimate Children. The births of 36 illegitimate children were registered. Dental Treatment. The following is a summary of the work during 1037 at the Council's Denta Clinic, No. 10, John Street, open on Thursday afternoons for nursing or cxpectan mothers, and children under five years of age:— Women. Children.

In four cases where the patients were very poor the dentures were provided free of charge; contributions towards the cost were required in all other cases and in three instances the patients were required to pay the whole cost. 73 Supply of Milk and Food for Expectant and Nursing Mothers and for Infants. The supply of milk and food at less than cost price was continued during the year for nursing mothers, expectant mothers in the last three months of pregnancy, children up to three years of age and, exceptionally, to children between three and five years of age. During the year 275 applicants received free or assisted milk under the scheme. This number included 126 who were receiving such assistance at the end of 1936. Grants were made to 143 new applicants. At the end of the year 1937, 147 applicants were receiving assistance, viz.:— Mothers. Children. Total. Free milk 74 49 123 Half-price milk 9 4 13 Prepared milk 7 4 11 90 57 147 The following table shows in detail how the 149 new applicants were assisted in 1937:— Milk. Dried Milk. Prepared Milk. Free. Part Cost. Free. Part Cost. Free, Part Cost. Expectant mothers 25 4 2 — — — Nursing mothers 24 7 8 1 — — Children 55 9 8 5 1 —' Home Help. The Council's Home Helps attended 22 cases during the year. All applications for the services of the Home Help are considered by the Assistance Sub-Committee of the Maternity and Child Welfare Committee. In two cases of extreme necessity the services of the Home Help were granted free. In all other cases the applicants were required to contribute towards the cost, contributions ranging from 2s. 6d. per week up to 15s. per week. The services of the Home Help have been much appreciated; and it has been found that the Council's provision meets a much felt want in the Borough. Convalescent Homes. Nineteen mothers each with baby and one or more toddlers were sent to the Zachary Merton Convalescent Home. Twelve mothers with infants only were sent to the Home. Eleven of the 31 cases referred to above were sent free of charge. Nine children under 5 years of age were sent to various convalescent homes, two free of charge. Emergency Homes. Four children were sent to emergency homes, 3 free of charge. K 74 Saffron Hill Maternity and Child Welfare Centre. Consultations in connection with this Voluntary Centre are held at the St. Winifred Club, St. Peter's School, Onslow Street, Saffron Hill. During the year ended 31st December, 1937, 84 children under five and 47 children over five, attended the consultations. The 131 children made 2,200 attendances. Extra food and nourishment were provided, also convalescent treatment at country and seaside Homes (49 mothers and 91 children); classes and lectures on health, care of the home, food, household economy and kindred subjects were held. The Chairman and Honorary Secretary is Miss Mary Canney, 75, Lamb's Conduit Street. Extension of Maternity and Child Welfare Services. During the year, a review of the Council's Maternity and Child Welfare services was carried to completion, and particulars of the increases effected in the services are given below:— Care of Children during Emergency Periods in the Home. In January, 1937, the Council approved arrangements for the admission of children under five years of age to Beauchamp Lodge Emergency Home, Warwick Crescent, W. 2, during periods of emergency in the home. The cost of main" taining a child in the home is 12s. 6d. per week, and parents are required to contribute towards the cost in accordance with their means. Later in the year arrangements were made with other homes on similar lines. During the year four children were sent to Emergency Homes. Revision of Scales of Assessment, The assessment scales regulating the provision of milk, home help service, convalescent home treatment and dentures were revised in January, 1937, thus bringing them into closer relation with existing economic conditions. The effect of the revision was to increase the quantity of milk granted and to make home help service, convalescent home treatment and dentures more easily available to the poorer residents of the Borough. Zachary Merton Convalescent Home, Rustington, Sussex. During the year an agreement was entered into between the Council and the Committee of the Zachary Merton Convalescent Home, providing for the reservation of three beds at the Home for mothers and infants, at a total annual cost of £225. During the year 31 mothers and infants and 19 toddlers were sent to the Home under this agreement. Additional Health Visitor. The Health Visiting staff was increased to three by the appointment in February, 1937, of Miss Pamela R. Williamson, S.R.N., S.C.M 75 Home Help Service. The Home Help Service was extended so as to be available, in cases in which it is desirable on medical grounds that such service should be available, prior to confinement. Maternity Services by Voluntary Hospitals. During the year the Council increased the grants paid to voluntary hospitals providing maternity services for residents of the Borough from £1 to £2 per case confined in hospital, and from 5s. 0d. to 10s. 0d. per case attended at home. Appointment of Obstetrical Consultant. In June, 1937, Dr. W. J. H. M. Beattie was appointed by the Council as Obstetrical Consultant, and also as Consultant for the purposes of the Puerperal Pyrexia and Puerperal Fever Regulations (1925/28). The latter appointment was made to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Dr. John Barris. It was not found necessary to call upon the services of the Consultant during the year. Provision of Meals for Necessitous Expectant and Nursing Mothers. In July, 1937, the Council approved arrangements for the provision of meals for necessitous expectant and nursing mothers. The number of meals provided in the remainder of the year was as follows:— No. of Mothers. No. of Meals. Part Cost. Free. 2 — 47 Infantile Mortality. The rate this year was 79 per thousand corrected live births, as compared with 60 last year. The actual number of infants were 22 and 18 respectively. Examination of the records shews that in eight cases prematurity was a direct or contributory cause of death. In some of these cases the fact that the mother continues to go to work until late pregnancy is an element in the causation Four of the infants were illegitimate; and it is found that the death rate is higher in this class than among legitimate children; this year it was 100 per 1,000 as compared with 75 per 1,000. In two cases death was due to complications associated with influenza, and two to whooping cough followed by bronchopneumonia. Both these conditions are particularly liable to be fatal in babies. In one other case the baby suffered from pyloric stenosis; and died in spite of a surgical operation. In another case the baby was dead when found, by the police, abandoned in the street. k 2 76 Deatln of Infants under One Year of Age, 1937.

There was one case during 1937 of a death associated with pregnancy. This resulted from a septic abortion occurring in an unmarried woman at the twentyfourth week of pregnancy. The circumstances of the case formed the subject of enquiries by the Coroner and by the Police. At the Coroner's inquest an open verdict was returned. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. During the year three cases of ophthalmia neonatorum were brought to notice, all notified in pursuance of the Public Health (Ophthalmia Neonatorum) Regulations, 1926 and 1928.

On the 1st January, 1937, there were two registered foster mothers in the Borough having the care of three children. These were removed from the register during the year and at the 31st December, 1937, there was no foster mother on the register. Under the arrangement made with the London County Council the School Care Committee is notified when a foster child reaches the age of nine years, at which age supervision under the Children Acts ceases. Notification is also sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the district concerned when foster children are removed into another area to the care of the parent, to another foster mother, or with the same foster mother. Applications are received from time to time from parents and others desirous of placing children with suitable foster mothers, but much difficulty is experienced in finding suitable homes where foster children can be received. In some cases it has been possible to effect satisfactory arrangements for the purpose through the co-operation of the Child Guidance Council. Birth Control. Arrangements were continued for contraceptive advice to be available for married women attending the Council's Centres in cases where further pregnancy would be injurious to health. The advice is to be given only where recommended by the Medical Officers of the Centres and approved by the Medical Officer of Health. The facilities offered by a voluntary hospital and a voluntary birth control clinic are utilised. Three cases were referred for such advice in 1937. Health and Baby Week. Health Week, with which Baby Week was combined, was observed in the Borough during the week 3rd to 9th October, 1937. The programme was as follows:— Co-operation with the School Organisations. Arrangements were made for children attending elementary schools in the Borough to write answers to a series of questions, on health topics, prizes being awarded to the girl and boy writing the best answers in each school. The questions were divided into two sets, one for children in senior departments and one for those attending junior departments The Mayor and Mayoress (Councillor and Mrs R.H.Haxell) kindly entertained to tea the prize winners and four other children from each school (two girls and two boys) whose answers were adjudged as next best to those of the prize winners. We are much indebted to the Head Teachers and staffs of the various schools for their invaluable help and co-operation in thus establishing in the minds of the children an interest in health. L 2 84 Health Poster Designs. Children in the elementary schools were also again invited to enter a competition in the designing cf health posters. Designs were submitted from four schools. Two prizes were awarded, and were both won by pupils of St. George-the-Martyr School The designs were again judged by Dr. E. Goodwin Rawlinson. SANITARY ADMINISTRATION. Public Mortuary. The Public Mortuary provided by the Council is situated in Goldsmith Street. During the year 50 bodies were deposited. There were 46 post-mortem examinations made, and 5 inquests held. On 3 occasions a body awaiting burial was removed to the mortuary on account of inadequate accommodation in the home. Forty-three bodies were brought in by order of the Coroner, and four by the Police. Inquests. During the year 35 inquests were held on the bodies of Holborn parishioners. Many of these died outside the Borough and the inquests were held in the districts where death took place, the deaths being subsequently transferred to Holborn. The causes of death certified as a result of such inquests were:— Natural causes, 6; Accidents, 16; Suicide, 4; Misadventure, 7; Open verdict, 2. The causes of death certified were as follows: — Natural Causes. Various conditions 6 Misadventure. Asphyxia whilst drunk 1 Operation 2 Carbon monoxide poisoning 2 Self-induced miscarriage 1 Want of attention at birth 1 Accidents. Septic infection, skin 1 Falls 8 Acute alcoholic poisoning 1 Street accidents 5 Choked by food 1 Suicidc. Coal gas poisoning 2 Jump from window 2 Open verdict. Drowning 1 Abortion 1 The Removal of Aged, Infirm and Diseased Persons. Power to deal with this matter is given by Section 224 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. In no case was it found necessary for the statutory powers to be exercised. Rent and Mortgage Interest Restriction Acts, 1920 to 1933. No application was received during the year for a certificate under the above Acts. 85 The Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. At the end of the year 1987, 76 names were on the Council's list of persons entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. Before entry of any name on the list the premises concerned are inspected to ensure that adequate provision is made for the storage of the poisons and for compliance with the rules governing the sale. Nuisance from Pigeons. Public Health (London) Act, 1936—Section 121. During the year several requests were received for steps to be taken to reduce the number of pigeons in the Borough. The arrangements made in previous years were continued under which two members of the Health Department staff endeavour to trap the birds. Operations were carried out by them on various occasions at four different sites frequented by pigeons, and 66 birds were caught. It must, however, be recorded, that on many occasions, even after several hours work, no birds were caught. In open spaces pigeon trappers are handicapped by members of the public who regularly feed the birds and who endeavour to prevent the effective use of the trapping nets. It is not desired to destroy all wild pigeons in Central London, but it is desirable that the number should be kept within reasonable limits. Demolition of Old Buildings. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1927, gave power to that Council to make By-laws in relation to the demolition of old buildings. By-laws dealing with the subject were made by the London County Council in July, 1929, and were approved by the Minister of Health on the 14th November, 1929. These By-laws are enforceable by the Metropolitan Borough Councils. We are informed by the Borough Engineer's Department of licences issued for the erection of hoardings for the purpose of the demolition of buildings, and the sites are then visited by the Sanitary Inspectors concerned. Propaganda. Health propaganda work was continued during the year, and included the exhibition of health posters; the use for special display purposes of two Empire Marketing Board frames, and the distribution of various leaflets. This Council also shared in the special campaign, inaugurated by the Prime Minister in September, 1937, for making health services better known. This campaign has been carried on into 1938. 86 APPENDIX. TABLE I. Vital Statistics of Whole District during 1937 and Ten Previous Years Year Population estimated to Middle of each Year. Births.
