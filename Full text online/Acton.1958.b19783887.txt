ACT 61 bs x1/18 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1950 ACT 61 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1958 2 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1958 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. I submit my Annual Report on the health of the Borough of Acton for the year 1958. The Borough has remained free of any serious outbreak of infectious diseases. Only three cases of Poliomyelitis were confirmed and there were no deaths from this disease. The scheme for vaccination against poliomyelitis was extended during the year to persons born between 1933-42 so that in fact all persons up to and including 25 years of age, as well as special categories of any age, became eligible for this protection. A rise occurred in both the birth rate and death rate, the principle causes of death being circulatory diseases, heart diseases and cancer. I append below a table showing the deaths that have occurred due to cancer of the lung and bronchus. 3 DEATHS FROM CANCER OF THE LUNG AND BRONCHUS— 1952 to 1958 Year Total 25—45 45—65 65 + Bronchus Lung Bronchus Lung Bronchus Lung M.

The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service provides a Pathological Service at the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens submitted for examination. Type No. of specimens examined Throat and Nose Swabs 143 Sputum 21 Faeces 479 Hair, Widals, etc. 10 Milk 104 Milk Bottles 18 Water 71 Ice-Cream 211 Miscellaneous Foods 9 HOSPITAL PROVISION The Regional Hospital Board of the N.W. Metropolitan Area, which includes Acton, is responsible for hospital treatment of the sick. The most difficult cases for which to obtain treatment are old persons or chronic sick who become acutely ill or who are in the terminal stage of their illness. These types of cases need continuous care and treatment, and it is just these requirements which cannot be met in the home. 13 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Under Section 47 of this Act power is given to the Councils of County Boroughs and County Districts to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for removal and detention, in a suitable hospital or other place, of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions; and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. Application is made to the Court only as a last resort, and in several cases which came to my notice during the year it was possible, either to persuade the persons concerned to enter a hospital or home voluntarily, or to provide home help, nursing and other local services so that they could remain in their own homes. Under Section 50 of this Act the Borough Council arranged for the burial of '2 persons where no other provision was being made. PUBLIC HEALTH LAUNDRY SERVICE The Public Health Laundry Service was commenced in November 1955 under the powers of Section 84 of the Public Health Act 1936, to assist incontinent old persons and to relieve them or their relatives of the burden of washing soiled linen. The service is running smoothly and the number of cases dealt with weekly fluctuated between 15 and 24. There is no doubt that a service of this kind is of great value to the community. Commercial launderies will not accept articles in the condition dealt with under the Council scheme, and the relief is greatly welcomed by patients and relatives. It is certain that in some cases relatives would be unable to cope with these incontinent old people and removal to hospital would be necessary. I give below details of the cases dealt with during 1958. Number of cases dealt with 63 Number of cases died 19 Number of cases removed to hospital 26 Number of cases where other arrangements made — Number of collections 1109 14 SECTION C HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL AMBULANCE FACILITIES The Middlesex County Council is responsible for this service. NURSING IN THE HOME This service is administered locally by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care in Acton during the year was 923 necessitating 32,378 visits. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE In June, we were fortunately able to fill two vacant posts in the Health Visitor establishment, relieving a staff shortage which had existed for over twelve months, and this enabled us to make further use of Pierrepoint Road Clinic by adding a fourth Child Welfare session. Home visiting shows a corresponding increase following the recruitment of new staff. CHILD WELFARE CLINICS The average attendances per session for the five Child Welfare Clinics are given below, last year's figures being shown in brackets. Avenue Road 4 sessions weekly 28.6 (26.3) Trinity Way 2 sessions weekly 32.7 (34.3) Cloister Road 2 sessions weekly 25.8 (26.6) Steele Road 2 sessions weekly 28.1 (26.3) Pierrepoint Road 3 sessions weekly 28.3 (32.9) Total number of children who first attended the clinics during the year, and who, on the date of their first attendance were: — Under one year of age 943 Between the ages of one and five 71 15 Total number of children who attended during the year, and who, at the end of the year were:— Under one year of age 864 Over one year 1,750 Total number of attendances at Clinics during the year:— By children under one year of age 13,695 By children between ane and five years 5,882 HEALTH VISITING Number of visits during the year by all Health Visitors working in this area:— To expectant mothers—First visits 454 Total visits 661 To children under one year of age—First visits 1,030 Total visits 3,803 To children between the age of one and five years—Total visits 5,084 MIDWIFERY SERVICE Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. Only 18.4% of the total births were home confinements. The bulk of the hospital confinements were accepted at Central Middlesex and Queen Charlotte's Hospitals, the table below giving the distribution:— Central Middlesex Hospital 37.5% Queen Charlotte's Hospital 28.9% Hammersmith Hospital 3.2% Other Hospitals 6.7% Nursing Homes 0.5% Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's midwives attending) 18.4% 16 ANTE-NATAL CLINIC Avenue Road Wednesday afternoons. Cloister Road Alternate Friday mornings. Pierrepoint Road Alternate Wednesday mornings. Trinity Way Alternate Wednesday mornings. The following table shows the number of attendances made throughout the year:— Number of new cases attending during the year 553 Total number who attended during the year 671 Total number of attendances made 2,422 Average number who attended per session 18.5 POST-NATAL CLINICS There were no specific post-natal clinics as the majority of patients return to hospital for this examination. The domiciliary cases who had been attended by Queen Charlotte's Midwives also attended the post-natal clinic at the hospital. Only five women attended the local ante-natal clinic for their post-natal examination. ANTE-NATAL EXERCISES Avenue Road One session weekly. Pierrepoint Road Two sessions weekly. 153 new patients were taken on during the year and there was a total of 963 attendances, an average of 7.4 per session.

Died between 1st day and. 28th day Surviving at end of 28 days Born in Hospital 61 7 1 53 Born at Home 8 1 — 2 Born in Nursing Home 1 - - 1 BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC As in previous years, arrangements for this purpose with the North Kensington Women's Welfare Association were continued. One afternoon and one evening clinic weekly were held at Trinity Way, East Acton. One new patient was referred for advice in 1958. HOME HELP SCHEME At the end of the year there were 9 full-time Home Helps, and 61 part-time Staff. The following table shows the number of cases actually attended:— Maternity 38 Tuberculosis 16 Chronic Sick 465 Other cases 29 18 SECTION D INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES, SCABIES AND OTHER CONDITIONS DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION As previously stated in last year's report, the extension of the Poliomyelitis vaccination scheme to all children over the age of 6 months has affected the rate of acceptance for Diphtheria protection, and this year's figures again show a slight decrease. The protected child population at the end of 1958 is as follows : Children under 5 years of age 2,215 Children 5-15 years 8,709 and the figures of work carried out during 1958 are given below : Total number of under 5s inoculated 413 Total number of over 5s inoculated 12 Boost dose after 3 years 222 Schick Test after 3 years—Negative 29 Positive — Primary Schick Test—Negative 3 Positive 2 POLIOMYELITIS IMMUNISATION With the introduction of plentiful supplies of American and Canadian Salk vaccine early in the year the waiting list was quickly dealt with, and a beginning was made in September on the plan to give a third or reinforcing dose to those cases already completed. Almost simultaneously the scheme was still further extended to include the age group born between 1933-1942, so that it now covered all persons born between 1933-1958, expectant mothers of all ages, the families of general practitioners, hospital staff and their families, and ambulance personnel. On the whole the response among the young people was disappointly slow in the first few months but it gathered momentum towards the end of the year and reached a fairly high level early in 1959, 19 The position at the 31st December 1958 was as follows : 10,169 persons had received their first two injections. Of the above, 2,072 had received the third or boost dose. An additional 686 had received their first and were awaiting their second injection and there was a waiting list only of 208. INFECTIOUS DISEASES During the year 399 cases of infectious diseases were notified compared with 1,177 during 1957. The decrease was mainly due to the fact that there were only 172 cases of measles notified compared with 919 last year. Food Poisoning Twenty eight cases of food poisoning were notified, none of them being associated with an outbreak. In 8 cases salmonella organisms were responsible for the illness, the causative agent not being discovered in the remainder. Typhoid Fever Two cases of Typhoid Fever were notified during the year. In neither case was it possible to trace the source of the infection. Poliomyelitis Of the three cases of poliomyelitis that were notified one was paralytic. None of the cases had been vaccinated. The scheme for vaccination against this disease was extended during the year. A report on the progress made will be found on page 18. 20 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR (Corrected).

During the year 22 persons were treated for dirty heads. Twenty of these were referred for treatment by the medical staff of factories within the Borough. Four persons were treated for scabies and two persons for body lice. 23 SECTION E HOUSING I am indebted to the Borough Engineer for the following information showing the progress made since the end of the war. Temporary Prefabricated Dwellings. Occupied 31.12.58 206 New Permanent Dwellings. (1) Within the Borough: Completed and occupied 31.12.58 1,140 (2) Outside the Borough: Completed and occupied 31.12.58 435 SECTION F SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. Waste of water has been notified to the Metropolitan Water Board on 28 occasions and, in addition to saving a measure of water supply, these notifications have been the means of preventing nuisance from dampness in many cases. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and in the course of the year a total of 32 samples were submitted to the Council's analyst or pathologist for examination as to chemical or bacteriological content, and the results generally indicated a satisfactory supply. 24 DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are connected to the sewerage system which discharges, by an arrangement with the L.C.C., into the London sewers. Stormwater is filtered and emptied into the Thames. PUBLIC CLEANSING The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1958 was 14,849 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 3,578 tons. All was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 1,798 tons of salvage were sold. RODENT CONTROL Test baiting of public sewers and treatment as necessary have been maintained and this work contributes largely to the improved conditions in the matter of infestation on the surface. The services of the Council's Rodent Destruction staff continue to be divided between work of destruction of newly discovered rats and mice by intensive treatment and regular visitation and examination of business premises to prevent infestation. The Borough is free from serious infestation. Investigation, destruction and maintenance have entailed a total of 5,874 visits by the Rodent Operatives, 1,670 to business premises and 4,204 to dwellings, in addition to inspections by the Public Health Inspectors as noted elsewhere. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Under the above Act, seventeen premises are registered for the manufacture of articles of upholstery, toys, etc., and three premises were licensed for the storing of rag flock. In the course of inspections it has been noted that rag flock and other filling materials are stored and used under hygienic conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT 1936, Section 154 It is an offence for any person collecting or dealing in rags, old clothes or similar articles, to sell or deliver, whether gratuitously 25 or not any article whatsoever to a person under the age of 14 years. It has been noted that such offences are most likely to occur in the vicinity of schools and observations are kept from time to time accordingly, with a view to preventing this practice of exchange. COMPLAINTS The number of complaints registered at the counter was 1,034 and by letter 231. INSPECTION OF FACTORIES The number of factories in the Borough is 693 and these have been subject to inspection by the Public Health Inspectors to ascertain that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and regulations as to sanitary accommodation are complied with. The usual work of inspection of factory canteens has been maintained, and advice given as necessary as to fitness or otherwise of food for human consumption. The home addresses of 59 outworkers engaged in work at home for Factories within and outside the Borough, have been visited to ascertain hygienic conditions and freedom from infectious disease. 26 FACTORIES ACT, 1937 PART I OF THE ACT 1.

Inspections of registered food premises are carried out from time to time and further action taken as necessary to ensure the premises and method of production being maintained at a satisfactory standard. Members of the Public Health Inspectors staff from time to time give lectures with film strip displays to stimulate and maintain interest in food hygiene and the general work of the Public Health Department. FOOD INSPECTION Reference to special examinations of consignments of food follow in this section of the report and while details of the quantity condemned are noted, it is not practicable to collate total quantities. The amount of food-stuffs surrendered owing to deterioration or damage is largely related to the extensive work of food manufacture and distribution in the Borough. There are two large wholesale grocery Depots within the Borough, and hence surrenders of canned and packeted goods are made to this Authority; these surrenders constitute the major part of such foodstuff noted. The following list collated for convenience shows some details of the surrendered food-stuffs: Bacon 2,337 lbs. Cream 22 tins Fish, wet 6 stone „ tinned 1,012 tins ,, shell 45 33 Flour and Flour Products 16 pkts. 60 lbs. 103 tins Fruit, tinned 17,527 tins dried 88 pkts. Ham, tinned 99 lbs. Meat: — Fresh 18,019 lbs. Tinned 1,276 tins Corned beef 381 tins Offal 100 tins Milk, Condensed 1,007 tins Pastes, Pickles, etc.531 jars Poultry: — Chickens 1 tin Preserves 865 tins Puddings, sweet and savoury 426 tins Soup, Strained Foods, etc. 504 tins Sugar 2 cwt. Vegetables 2,643 tins Miscellaneous 29 jars, etc. 30 lbs. DISPOSAL OF CONDEMNED FOOD There has been no change in the methods of disposing of condemned and surrendered food noted in the report. At the large slaughterhouse and bacon factory in the Borough all diseased or infected carcases, and parts of carcases, are destroyed in special plant producing inedible material — bone meal, fertiliser, etc.— under supervision of the Council's Meat Inspectors. Apart from condemned food material dealt with at these slaughterhouse premises all surrendered diseased, or unsound, food is disposed of for animal feeding purposes, or otherwise as appropriate. 34 FOOD COMPLAINTS There were 26 complaints as to unsound food, etc., and in 3 cases the Council instituted legal proceedings. Details are as follows: — Date of Hearing Offence Result 18.4.58 Tobacco in bread Insect life in Jap biscuits Fined £200.0.0. Costs £31.10.0. 27.6.58 Nail in processed cheese Discharged. Costs awarded to Council £8.8.0. 27.6.58 Paper in bread Discharged. Costs awarded to Council £8.8.0 21.11.58 Mould in steak & kidney pie Fined £10.

FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS 1955 Early in the year a baker was prosecuted by the Council for failing to keep clean the walls, doors, floor and ceiling of his bakehouse, contrary to Regulation 23 (1) of the Food Hygiene Regulations; he was found guilty and was fined £50. Later in the year he committed a similar offence for which a fine of £200 was imposed. MILK There are only two dairies in the Borough and the practice of distributing milk wholesale in bottles from large bottling depots to local depots, for delivery by roundsmen, or over the counter in milk shops remains. 104 samples of milk were taken throughout the Borough and following submission to the Pathological Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, the results of the bacteriological examinations indicated that generally satisfactory conditions of processing and storage were maintained. The wholesale, pasteurising and bottling centre in Bollo Lane has continued in operation without cause for complaint, and 18 35 empty bottles taken from the filling lines for examination as to sterility, were found to be sterile. The following licences were granted under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasturised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1953, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954. Dealers' Licences: — Tuberculin Tested Milk 18 Pasteurised Milk 37 Sterilised Milk 30 Supplementary Licences:— Tuberculin Tested Milk 10 Pasteurised Milk 11 Sterilised Milk 11 117 ICE-CREAM The number of manufacturers of ice-cream in the Borough is now 4. Each of them is equipped to produce pasteurised ice-cream, and production is in every way in accord with the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1947/1952. There are 148 premises where ice-cream is not manufactured, but where the commodity is sold in the main from pre-packed stocks. During the year "211 samples were taken, 128 of ice-cream manufactured in the Borough, and 83 from shops or itinerant vendors trading in icecream manufactured outside the Borough. The high bacteriological standard reflected in the results of examination of samples of ice-cream, together with inspection of plant and premises, has shown that processing and storage conditions are satisfactory and well maintained. MEAT INSPECTION AT SLAUGHTERHOUSES Regular slaughtering of pigs at the slaughterhouse of T. Wall and Sons has grown during the year and has necessitated the 36 manent attendance of a larger staff of the Local Authority in the course of meat inspection, with increased hours of overtime duty.

Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk (new) 36 2 Milk (various) 69 Butter 22 Cream 25 1 Drugs 28 Fish and Fish Products 12 Fruit—Fresh and Processed 5 Ice-cream 22 Liver 6 Margarine 11 Meat and Meat Products 49 Non-Brewed Condiment 7 3 Vinegar 27 Miscellaneous 19 3 338 9 New Milk "Two samples of milk taken from churns of new milk consigned by a farmer to a milk processing depot in your Borough were found to be below the legal standard for solids-not-fat. The deficiencies were slight and the average for the whole consignment was satisfactory, and in consequence, no further action was taken. Cream " One sample of tinned cream was found to be deficient in fat. The sample was the last of a consignment which was not repeated by the retailer, and no further samples of this particular brand were found. Non-Brewed, Condiment "Three samples of non-brewed condiment were found to be below the accepted minimum standard of ascetic acid content. 39 Further examination disclosed the presence of a minute form of life known as "vinegar eels" 'which had apparently come from the wooden barrel containing the condiment. The presence of this life was only apparent upon the most careful examination, and the deficiency of the ascetic acid was most likely due to absorption in the barrel. The barrel was supplied by the manufacturer, and in view of all the circumstances, the retailer was given an Official Caution. Lemon Juice " A claim by a prominent manufacturer for an added vitamin "C "content in pure lemon juice sold in your Borough was investigated. There was no declaration of the quantity of the vitamin "C" present on the labels of the bottles, and the firm was cautioned by the Chief Officer for this omission. Creamy Chocolate Lollipops "The manufacturer was advised to alter the label on this confection on the grounds that there was no milk fat present, and that the description "creamy" as applied to a solid article was therefore misleading. Buttered Rolls "An employee in a works cantecn complained that he was supplied with rolls containing margarine in response to a request for "buttered rolls The matter was taken up with the catering firm concerned, when it was established that there had been a genuine mistake. Furthermore, there was insufficient evidence to establish an offence beyond all reasonable doubt, and no further action was taken. Merchandise Marks Act, 1926 "A total of 139 inspections under the Mechandise Marks Act, 1926, and the Marking Orders made thereunder were made, requiring the examinations of 71 displays of Meat, 134 of Apples, 107 of Tomatoes, 15 of Dried Fruit and 109 items of Poultry. Where retailers have shown laxity in the marking of their displays. 40 verbal warnings have been given. One firm of butchers were prosecuted for marking seven displays of Argentine meat as " English and were fined £10.0.0d on each summons. This firm were also charged with selling Argentine chilled beef not marked with an indication of origin, and were fined £5.0.0d. for this offence. The fines in this prosecution totalled £75.0.0d. with costs £10.10.0d. Labelling of Food Order, 1953 "This Order requires that all pre-packed food shall be clearly marked so as to enable the purchaser to be fully aware of the nature of the article, its ingredients and the name and address or trade mark of the packers. A total of 481 articles were examined on 94 premises. False or Misleading Description "A considerable amount of work has been done in the careful scrutiny of labels and advertising in connection with pre-packed food. This work is of benefit to the entire county irrespective of where within the county the work is done. In the year under review corrective action has been taken, inter alia, in relation to descriptions applied to "milk-block", "Double Tea and imitation cream powder, cakes filled with a mixture of butter and sugar, canned mixed vegetables, raspberry sprup, powdered soup mixes, medium red salmon, gorgonzola cheese spread and cheese spread. Special Designated Milk "One dealer in your Borough was licensed in respect of "Pasteurised" milk processed on the premises. Nine inspections of the plant were made and fifty samples taken, all of which were satisfactory. Raw Milk "To ensure that the raw milk delivered within the area of your Borough was free from tubercule bacilli, 32 samples were taken. None were found to be contaminated 41 SECTION H DISEASES OF ANIMALS Throughout the year, the Borough remained free from any outbreak of notifiable disease, although there were numerous outbreaks throughout the country which necessitated exercising the utmost vigilance to see that no animals were moved into the Borough from infected areas. SECTION J ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION There has been no major change in the siting or recording of the three deposit gauge and seven lead peroxide stations and analyses have been maintained throughout the year. ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY THE LEAD PEROXIDE METHOD The monthly figures for each station for the years 1957 and 1958 are shown on page 42 and the 1958 figures are illustrated graphically on page 43. The station with the highest monthly figure—4.6 and with the highest average figure—2.7 was Bashley Road. The station with the lowest monthly figure—0.4—and with the lowest average figure—1.7—was Acacia Road. The average of all stations for the year was 2.0 which is slightly above that of the previous year. DEPOSIT GAUGES The monthly figures for each station are shown statistically on page 44 and graphically on page 43. The yearly average figure—15.60 tons/sq. mile—has risen very slightly above that of the previous year although the amount of combustible material in the deposit has again increased by a small amount. Once again the station with the greatest monthly deposit— 24.6 tons/sq. mile — and the greatest average deposit — 18.44 tons/sq. mile — was Bashley Road. The Kendal Avenue gauge showed the lowest monthly deposit of 8.01 tons/sq. mile and the lowest average deposit of 13.26 tons/sq. mile. 42 ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY LEAD PEROXIDE INSTRUMENTS Weight of SO, in Milligrams per 100 Square Centimetres per day.
