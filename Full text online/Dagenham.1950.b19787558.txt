DAGENHAM AC 4411 (1) DAEENHAM DAE 24 BOROUGH OF DAGENHAM ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1950 CECIL HERINGTON, M.D. (Lond.), D.P.H. BOROUGH OF DAGENHAM ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1950 CECIL HERINGTON, M.D. (Lond.), D.P.H. 3 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Dagenham. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting my report on the health of the Borough of Dagenham for the year 1950. For the first time since Dagenham became a municipal entity (in 1926) the birth rate has fallen below that for England and Wales as a whole, 15.36 compared with 15.8. 15.36 is the crude birth rate, when the comparability factor of 0.95 is applied the adjusted rate is 14.59. This reduction is an indication of the stabilization of the population and of the fact that the population is ageing, or in other words that the number of persons of the reproductive age compared with the total population is diminishing. The crude death rate was 6.92, the adjusted rate being 11.35, which compares favourably with that for the country as a whole which was 11.6. The comparability factor given for Dagenham for purposes of computing the death rate is 1.64. It is very gratifying to be able to record that for the second year in succession there were no maternal deaths. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. There has been a marked increase in the notifications of both Measles and Whooping Cough, but probably the severity of attack has been light; there were no deaths attributed to Whooping Cough, but one death was assigned to Measles. With regard to active prevention of Whooping Cough, the Whooping Cough Immunisation Committee of the Medical Research Council has now released some very informative findings gleaned as results of extensive research over a number of years. These may be considered as encouraging but it must be borne in mind that the effectivity of the best antigens so far prepared falls far short of the Diphtheria prophylactics in common use. One case of Diphtheria was notified in the person of a man aged 22. He had not been immunised. It might be of interest here to quote from the Annual Report of my predecessor 20 years ago "The light incidence of Diphtheria in the country as a whole during 1931 was reflected in the small number of local notifications received, these being only 207 as against 383 in 1930." Compare this with 1950 when, as mentioned above, one case only was reported and that was not fatal. In the year 1931, 12 deaths occurred from Diphtheria. 4 Poliomyelitis was confirmed in seven cases ; two of these were of the nonparalytic type. There was one death. This is a large reduction from the previous year when 26 cases were confirmed. The differentiation between paralytic and nonparalytic forms of this disease was not made prior to 1950. The number of persons on the Tuberculosis register shows an increase from 1,010 to 1,113, but the number of deaths from Tuberculosis (all forms) shows a reduction from 54 to 49. This apparent increase in incidence should not be regarded with alarm. It is attributable to immigration of persons suffering from this disease, who receive priority in housing by sending Authorities. MORTUARY. The Council's mortuary which was built many years ago and proved to be obsolete by reason of its size, design and equipment, has been closed down. Accommodation has temporarily been afforded by the East Ham Corporation. Negotiations are now proceeding with a neighbouring Borough with a view to the extension and modernization of an existing mortuary, which, when completed, should meet the needs of the participating Authorities. CARAVANS. Three applications for land in the Northern part of the Borough to be used as sites for caravans were received. In view of the inability of providing satisfactory sanitary facilities the applications were refused. The only appeal against the Council's decisions was dismissed by the Magistrate's Court. FOOD POISONING. Information was received that several children in an Infants' School were suffering from diarrhoea and abdominal pains. On visiting it was found that of the 138 children on the register 16 were absent, the cause of each case being given as diarrhoea and abdominal symptoms. Of these, eight had taken school dinners. All four classes were involved. I visited the school and discussed the position with the Head Mistress. Suggestions were made to her with regard to the control of the outbreak, and the names of the private Doctors of the children concerned were ascertained. Following this I telephoned these Doctors and informed them of the possibility of Sonne Dysentery. During my interview with the Head Mistress I requested her to supply me with any information of sickness amongst members of the teaching and canteen staff. Three days later a telephone message was received that a member of the canteen staff was away ill. This lady was visited at her home and in co-operation with her Doctor a bacteriological 5 investigation was carried out. Infection with the Sonne Dysentery bacillus was confirmed. After suitable treatment and a series of further investigations, she became free from infection and was permitted to resume duty. Although it is impossible to pinpoint the cause of this out' break, there is substantial evidence that the canteen worker was the source of infection. The fact that eight of the children infected did not take school meals does not disprove this ; the probability is that the infected children disseminated the organisms by close contact. SCABIES. It is somewhat unsual to have to invite atten' tion, with pleasure, to the discontinuance of a service provided for the benefit of the public. Such, however, is the case with the Scabies Clinic. Scabies has now, fortunately, ceased to exist as a public health problem in Dagenham. I take this opportunity of expressing appreciation of the value of the services of Mr. Farrow and Mrs. Pharaoh, Clinic attendants. It is with pleasure that I again record my thanks to the Chair' man and members of the Committees associated with the adminis' tration of the health services of the Borough. I would also once more offer my sincere thanks to my colleagues and members of the staff for their help so readily given at all times. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CECIL HERINGTON, Medical Officer of Health.

Since November, 1938, eight local authorities in the South Essex Water' works Company's area of supply have carried out a co-ordinated system of sampling. During the year two chemical and two bacteriological samples were taken from the Company's mains in this Borough and all were satisfactory. The water is not liable to have plumbo-solvent properties, and no action was called for in respect of any form of contamination. Approximately .10 per cent. of the inhabited houses and .084 per cent. of the population of the Borough take their water from standpipes. During the year the mains laid in the Borough were as follows :â€” Diameter length 3" 52 yards 4" 1,270 â€ž 6" 356 â€ž Total 1,678 â€ž 307 supplies were afforded to houses during the year. The Chief Engineer of the South Essex Waterworks Company has furnished me with the following report :â€” "Bacteriological and chemical examinations are made of the raw river water, of the water in its various stages of treat' ment and of the water going into supply and of both raw and chlorinated water from the Company's wells. Analyses are also made of samples obtained from consumers' taps in the various parts of the Company's district and all proved to be satisfactory. Between 3,000 and 4,000 chemical, bacteriological and biological examinations have been made during the year. All water going into supply was wholesome." 18 FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 & 1948 Inspections.

Warning letters were sent in other cases. Clean Food Campaign Lectures were given by the Medical Officer of Health and Chief Sanitary Inspector to food handlers working in the Borough. Arrangements were made for the assistants to attend in the employers' time; there was a good response. Lectures have also been given to the members of various local organisations, especially those attended by women. On two occasions all the local cinemas exhibited films ("Another Case of Poisoning" and "Fly About the House") and the department arranged suitable publicity throughout the Borough. Food Poisoning Outbreaks During the year 11 cases of food poisoning were notified; these covered four small outbreaks and one single case.
