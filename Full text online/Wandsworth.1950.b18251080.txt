During 1950, 99 certificates were issued and the amount collected was £28 189. Removal of Diseased or Infirm Persons to Institutions Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, provision is made for the removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention. During the year it was necessary to make application to a Court for the removal of one such case, that of a woman aged 78 years. Eradication of Bed Bugs The methods employed for freeing infested houses include the stripping of all paper from the walls, the removal of wooden mouldings and skirtings and the application of a blow lamp to the room surfaces. Sulphur and "Cimex" candles are often used by house owners and the spraying of rooms by the disinfecting staff of the Council is carried out, proprietary insecticides being used. Infested bedding is removed to the Disinfecting Station and treated by steam. During the year 232 rooms in 197 houses were found to be infested by bed bugs and disinfestation was carried out in all cases. Special steps are taken to ensure that the furniture and clothing of families about to be accommodated in the Council's houses and flats are freed from vermin. Hydrogen cyanide gas is used for the disinfestation of the furniture, which is placed in special vans constructed for the purpose, the process being carried out by a contractor. Bedding is not subjected to hydrogen cyanide but is disinfested by steam at the Council's Disinfecting Station. Dustbin Accommodation—Section 105, Public Health (London) Act, 1936 During the year action was taken under Section 5 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in respect of 332 premises, and 307 dustbins were provided. In one case an appeal was made by the owner to the London County Council. The appeal was allowed. Mortuary and Crematorium The Mortuary at Wandsworth was used throughout the year and 384 bodies were received there. Under the Crematorium Regulations, 1930, 968 cremations were authorised during 1950 as compared with 809 in 1949, and 634 in 1948. 20 HOUSING Statistics Relating to Housing Public Health Act No. of houses inspected on account of complaints or illness 12913 Re-inspections 35152 Number of sanitary notices served: Intimation notices 5004 Nuisance notices 1425 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 5967 Housing Act, 1936 Number of houses inspected—house to house (Housing Consolidated Regs., 1925) 83 (clearance area.)

In four cases the applications were withdrawn. In the remaining five cases, the applications were acceded to and Statutory Certificates were granted. Much of the work to put them in a reasonable state of repair was carried out during the year. 22 Housing CLEARANCE OF INSANITARY HOUSES 1950 St. Alphonsus Road Area: This area, which is divided into three sections, comprising 79 dwelling-houses, was represented on 22nd March, 1950. Closing Orders were made during the year on the basement premises at 132c Cavendish Road, 861a Garratt Lane, 7 Crichton Street and 43a Mount Ephraim Road. Notices were served on the owners of the basement premises at 26 Elmsleigh Road, but were withdrawn on receipt of an undertaking that the premises would not be used for human habitation. Similar notices were served in respect of basement premises at 19 Angles Road and 342 Streatham High Road. The Demolition Orders made on 2 and 4 Westbury Street in 1947 have now been complied with and the houses have been taken down. Three of the basement premises in Byrne Road, on which Closing Orders were made by the Council in 1947, were finally closed. Two other premises, however, continued in occupation. The basement premises at 130 Merton Road, on which a Closing Order was made in 1949, were also closed. The Clearance of Insanitary Houses in the Borough of Wandsworth (1919—1950) The first steps towards the clearance of houses in Wandsworth considered to be unsuitable for human habitation were taken at the end of the first World War when, in April, 1919, Closing Orders were made on the Old School House, Felsham Road, Putney, and various properties in Field's Alley, Southfields. The latter were demolished by the owners—Messrs. Hardwicks—in order to extend their business premises, whilst the former was afterwards included in one of the Council's later Clearance Schemes. During the succeeding years up to 1925, Closing Orders were made from time to time in respect of some 11 dwellings, five of which were occupied caravans; but it was not until December of that year that a considerable area, containing 13 houses, was scheduled for clearance by the Council. This was in the former Tooting Ward and comprised eight houses in Mitcham Lane and five in Shepherd's Close. The demolition was completed by 1928, and the site was afterwards developed by the owners. During the next two or three years a systematic survey of the Borough was undertaken, as a result of which 632 houses grouped in 33 areas were scheduled as insanitary. Conditions varied to some extent in the different areas, but all the houses were well below Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1950 23 standard and beyond reconditioning. In 1930 and the years following the Medical Officer of Health made representations under Section 1 of the Housing Act (1930) in respect of several of these areas. In its five-year programme, also drafted in 1930, the Housing Committee, under Alderman Henry Prince, made provision for 524 flats to rehouse the persons displaced from the unhealthy areas. The economic crisis of 1931 caused some modification of these plans, one of the largest of which concerned the Saxby Street Area. The Saxby Street Area: This large area of 105 houses in Clapham South (old ward) was originally represented on 5th March, 1930, under the Housing Act, 1925. Four hundred and seventy-six persons in 123 families were involved, but it was not possible for the Council to develop the area at that time. A further representation was made on 1st December, 1937, under the Housing Act, 1936, and the area was declared a Clearance Area on 22nd March, 1938. Progress was halted by the outbreak of the Second World War and by 1950 64 of the 93 "red" houses were still occupied. The North Street (Clapham) Area, comprising 27 houses, was represented in October, 1930, and declared a Clearance Area in January, 1931. The site was cleared by 1932 and developed by the Council. Besides the scheduled areas, 13 unhealthy houses in Salvador Street, Tooting, were also cleared in 1930 and the Granada cinema arose on their site. Eight areas of varying sizes were represented in January and February, 1931, and declared Clearance Areas in the following May. They ranged from Great Acre Court Area, in Clapham South, with 20 houses, to the Carter's Yard Area, of Southfields, with three houses. Seventy-seven houses were included in all, mostly on small sites which were developed by the owners after clearance. In 1933 action was initiated in respect of three main areas. The Greyhound Square and Barrow Road Areas, together comprising 41 houses in Streatham, were represented on 2nd and 31st October. They were declared Clearance Areas on 23rd January, 1934, and the Public Enquiry was held on 23rd March, 1934. The sites were cleared in 1937 and the Council afterwards developed them. The Felsham Road area of Putney, comprising 61 houses, was also represented on 31st October, 1933, and declared a Clearance Area on 23rd January, 1934. The Council afterwards developed the site which was cleared by 1937. The Wandsworth Plain Area: The largest group yet represented was the Wandsworth Plain Area, of Southfields (i9t November, 1933). It included 98 dwellings and was declared a Clearance Area at the same time as the Felsham Road Area. The site was clear by 1938 and blocks of Council flats have succeeded the original properties. Other sites in 1932 and 1933 were cleared by the owners, new houses and maisonettes replacing the former dwellings, 14 in all. 24 Housing Areas in Clapham South: Five areas in Clapham South were represented on 16th November, 1934. They were declared Clearance Areas on 22nd January, 1935, and cleared between 1936 and 1939. One hundred and sixty-six houses were involved and the site was developed by the Council. Two smaller Areas, comprising 24 houses, were cleared in 1934 and subsequently developed by the Council. Sixteen other houses during the same year were also cleared by private owners who developed the sites in various ways. Three more areas in Tooting were represented together in January, 1935, and declared Clearance Areas the following May. They were cleared in 1936 and the Council developed the site. Seventeen other properties in all parts of the Borough were also cleared and developed by private owners in 1935. The largest area represented in 1937 consisted of 28 houses in Salvador Road, Tooting (16th February, 1937, declared a Clearance Area 21st April, 1937), which were cleared during the latter half of the year and in 1938. The owner subsequently developed the site. A group of 16 houses in Putney, the Sadlers Buildings Area, was also declared a Clearance Area in October, 1937, and cleared two years later. The site was due for development by the Council. Several other houses in all parts of the Borough were represented in 1937 and the sites were afterwards developed by the owners. Lack of space precludes a detailed description of all insanitaryproperties cleared up to the outbreak of the Second World War. Mention should be made, however, of the Point Pleasant Areas, which included a combined total of 60 houses. They were represented in October, 1937, and most of them had been demolished by 1940. The owners, the Aluminium Plant and Vessel Company, made use of the sites to extend their factory. Twenty-three houses in the Cubitts Cottages Area, in the Springfield Ward, were represented in October, 1937, but owing to the war the site was not finally cleared until 1946, when the Council undertook to develop it. Work was also delayed on the Weimar Street, Putney, area (represented 1st October, 1937) and the Oldridge Road Area (represented 29th March, 1938). These Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1950 25 sites, comprising 42 houses, were eventually taken over by the London County Council for development. The North Passage Area, Putney, with 26 houses, which was represented on 2nd February, 1939, was also held up. By the end of 1950, however, only two of the houses were still occupied. Six had been destroyed by enemy action. Post-war Clearance Scheme: During the six years of war the Council's clearance schemes were suspended. Between 1940 and 1945 only 38 houses in all were demolished, some by enemy action. Among the owners, the Wandsworth Gas Company demolished 11 houses in Warple Way and incorporated the site into their factory. Since the war, seven houses in Garratt Lane, Fairfield Ward, have been represented (13th March, 1947) and declared a Clearance Area (27th July, 1948). Eight houses in Balham New Road were similarly represented on 30th July, 1947. Several smaller pre-1939 areas, where clearance was delayed by the war, are now once more under review, and several new areas have been scheduled as unfit for human habitation. Of these, the St. Alphonsus Road Area, consisting of 79 houses, was represented on 22nd March, 1950. The total number of houses dealt with over the period under review by 31st December, 1950, was 1,027. Of these, 814 had been demolished, 15 closed and 198 were still outstanding. Insanitary and Underground Rooms: During the same period. Closing Orders were made on 308 rooms, considered to be unfit for human habitation, in 114 houses. Two hundred and thirty-one of these were underground rooms. 26 FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES There are four Inspectors engaged in the supervision of the food supply. One of them is the Food and Drugs Inspector of the Borough and is occupied in procuring samples of food and drugs for analysis by the Public Analyst, and the supervision of dairy premises. The other three Inspectors are designated Food Inspectors, and supervise all other premises where food is sold, stored, manufactured or prepared for sale. One third of the Borough is allocated to each Inspector. The three Inspectors also carry out the duties required under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933, and the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. With the object of ensuring that all food businesses are supervised sytematically, a register of all premises where a food business is carried on has been compiled and is kept up to date. This Register includes not only those premises which are subject to some form of legal control, but also other premises in which a food business of any description is carried on. Table IX has been drawn up to show the number of food premises in the Borough and the nature of the business carried on at these premises. It is a common occurrence for more than one food business to be conducted on the same premises and the Table is arranged to bring out this fact. In column 1 of the Table the number of separate; food premises in the Borough is given, classified according to the nature of the principal business carried on. In columns 3 to 18 the number of different businesses actually conducted from these premises is shown, those which are subject to some form of legal control being specified. The number of shops distributing milk in the Borough is also shown in column 2 of the Table. The total number of food premises on the register in the Borough is 2,616, and during 1950 they were visited on 39,744 occasions. 27 Food and Food Premises TABLE IX NATURE OF PRINCIPAL BUSINESS A.

During the year 49 applications have been received from persons to be registered as distributors of milk. In each case the certificate of registration was granted. Fourteen notices of cancellation of registration have been received. At the end of the year there were 190 persons on the register, including 16 persons with premises outside the Borough. The number of dairies on thp register at the end of the year was 30. The bulk of the milk sold by retail within the Borough is sent out in bottles filled in properly constructed dairies and its quality is good. Food and Drugs Act, 1938 Six hundred and eighty-five samples of milk were submitted for analysis. All of these were reported as genuine, with an average fat content of 3.6 per cent. The Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949-50, and The Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949-50 The regulations came into force on 1st October, 1949, and replace The Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1936 to 1948. They provide for the issue of licences to persons who sell milk under any of the following designations: "Accredited," "Pasteurised," "Sterilised," "Tuberculin Tested." The following licences for the sale of milk under these designations were granted during the year: Accredited Nil Pasteurised 184 Sterilised 248 Tuberculin Tested 144 Total 576 Food and Food Premises 29 A person who holds a "Tuberculin Tested" licence and a "Pasteurised" or "Sterilised" licence may use the designations "Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised)" or "Tuberculin Tested (Sterilised)" as the case may be. Five hundred samples of milk were procured from distributors, schools, hospitals and institutions and were submitted to the phosphatase test, the methylene blue test and the turbidity test. Thirteen of these failed to comply with the prescribed tests. In addition 15 samples of milk were examined for the presence of tubercle bacilli. In each case negative results were obtained. MEAT There are 214 butchers' shops in the Borough. The majority are registered under Section 14 (1) (b) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, preserved, pickled or pressed foods. 2,942 visits were made to these shops during the year. Slaughter of Animals There are three private slaughter-houses in the Borough and they were visited on 38 occasions during the year. Eleven carcases of pigs were inspected before and after slaughter. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933 Section 3 of this Act provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or shinned in a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by a local authority and in force under this section. During the year one application from a person desirous of acting as a slaughterman was submitted to the Council and granted. War Time Piggeries There are now 12 war time piggeries in this Borough and they were inspected on 65 occasions. UNSOUND FOOD 107 varieties of foodstuffs suspected to be unsound were examined at the request of the owners and afterwards either destroyed or released for animal feeding. The owners were granted a certificate to this effect. 30 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1950 PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933, AND PHARMACY AND MEDICINES ACT, 1941 These Acts provide for the listing with the Local Authority of all persons dealing in poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. The number of persons on the Council's list at the end of 1950 was 389, and 772 visits were made to the premises of the listed persons by the Food Inspectors. The principal businesses conducted on the premises of these applicants is shown in Table X. The majority of the listed sellers are also purveyors of food. TABLE x—Part II of Poisons List Principal Business No. of Premises No. of Inspections Grocers 220 421 Hairdressers 19 43 Drug Stores 25 53 Domestic Stores, Ironmongers, etc. 118 243 Nurserymen 4 9 Confectioners 3 3 Total 389 772 Bakehouses There are 84 bakehouses in the Borough, of which 22 are in basements and subject to the provisions of Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937. 158 visits were made to these premises by Food Inspectors during the year. WATER SUPPLY The bulk of the water supply in the Borough is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board and this has been satisfactory, both in quality and quantity. There are 14 artesian wells in the Borough, seven of which are in operation for food manufacture and drinking. There are also six shallow wells, all of which are out of use, and one spring supply used for drinking purposes. Food and Food Premises 31 THE FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938 Registration of Premises Section 14 (1) of this Act requires that any premises used or proposed to be used for: (a) the sale, or the manufacture for the purpose of sale, of ice-cream, or the storage of ice-cream intended for sale; or (b) the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food; shall be registered by the owner or the occupier thereof with the local authority. During the year 150 applications for registration under the provisions of Section 14 (1) (a) and 154 applications for registration under the provisions of Section 14 (1) (b) were submitted to the Council. In all cases premises were found to be satisfactory and the registration granted. Section 57 (1) (a) of this Act requires that it shall not be lawful: for the occupier of any premises to use them as a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard or permit them to be so used, unless he holds a licence granted under this section by the local authority authorising him to keep those premises as a slaughterhouse or, as the case may be, as a knacker's yard. During the year three applications for the renewal of licences to use premises as slaughter-houses were submitted to the Council and granted. Analysis of Ice-cream During the year 160 samples of ice-cream were tested in accordance with the technique suggested by the Ministry of Health and Public Health Laboratory Service in their Bulletin of March, 1947. The following table gives a summary of the results: TABLE XI Methylene Blue Test Coliform Test. Provisional Grade No. of Samples Coliform in l/10th ml. (non-faecal) No. of Samples 1 33 absent 72 2 20 present 8 3 14 4 11 Total 78 Total. 80 32 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1950 In addition two samples were submitted to the Methylene Blue Test, which was nullified due to interference of colouring matter. In addition 60 samples were examined for their fat content. A summary of the results is given in the following table: Under 2½ per cent. fat 3 2½ per cent. to 10 per cent. fat 33 Over 10 per cent. fat 24 Additional supplies of fat and sugar were allowed to manufacturers who signed an undertaking that their ice-cream would contain at least 2½ per cent. of fat. Analysis of Food and Drugs 1,877 samples of foods and drugs were procured for analysis during the year. 685 samples of milk, 1,038 other foodstuffs and 154 drugs. Of these 547 were submitted as formal samples while 1,330 were purchased informally. One or .18 per cent. of the formal samples and 11 or .82 per cent. of the informal samples were found to be adulterated or not up to standard. The total adulterations reported were 12 or .64 par cent. of the samples submitted. The 12 samples found to be adulterated were: four samples of ammoniated tincture of quinine, two of non-brewed condiment, one each of cooking fat, malted milk, rice, sherbet powder, solution of iodine and white pepper. Police Court Proceedings It was not necessary to take Police Court Proceedings in any of the above cases of adulterated samples, but proceedings under Section 9 (1) of the above Act were taken in respect of one case of selling food (a meat pie) intended for, but unfit for, human consumption. The Court treated the defendant as a first offender and ordered him to pay £7 7s. costs. Special Analysis One sample of candies, one sample of chocolates and two samples of bubbly-gum were examined for faecal coli. Negative results were obtained in each case. Two samples of luncheon meat and one sample of unsweetened condensed milk were submitted to a bacteriological examination following a question as to their fitness for sale. In each case they were found to be fit for sale. Five samples of mussels were examined for the presence of typhoid organisms. The bacteriological examination did not reveal the presence of these organisms. 33 FACTORIES ACT, 1937 Prescribed particulars required by Section 128 Part I—(1) Inspections Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written notices Occupiers prosecuted (1) Factories in which Sections 1. 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the Act are to be enforced by Local Authorities 737 235 7 - (2) Factories not included above in which Section 7 of the Act is enforced by the Local Authority 1161 527 11 - (3) Other premises in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority (excluding outworkers' premises) 6 - - - Total 1904 762 18 - (2) Defects Particulars Number of cases in which defects were found Number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted Found Remedied Referred To H.M.

This sample was correctly prepared according to the British Pharmacopoeia 1932, which was revised in 1948. 54 White Pepper Contained elements of black pepper. 618 Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine 25% deficient in ammonia. 687 Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine 14% deficient in ammonia. 783 Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine 30% deficient in ammonia. 787 Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine 20% deficient in ammonia. 812 Rice 0.36% of foreign matter was found to be present. 893 Condiment Vineger 40% deficient in acetic acid. 903 Cooking Fat 2.1% water was present. 957 Malted Milk It was unable to reconstitute the product, which was old stock. 1145 Sherbet Contained magnesium carbonate and made an alkaline, instead of an acid, beverage. 36 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1950 Adulteration The amount of adulteration detected during the year was: For formal samples 0.18 per cent. For informal samples 0.82 per cent. For all samples 0.64 per cent. Case No. 22 Complaint Samples Chocolate Fudge: This sample was suspected to have caused sickness. It was found that it contained no ingredient likely to cause harm, although it was rather poorly mixed. The complaint was considered not justified. Case No. 52 Butter: This sample, which it was suggested contained margarine, was found to be 100 per cent. butter. Case No. 53 Christmas Pudding: This sample showed no evidence of deterioration and is quite suitable for sale. There is no evidence of mould-growth, the fat has no taste of acidity or rancidity and though there is a large proportion of dried fruit there was no sand nor grit present. The complaint that it contained sand was considered not justified. Case No. 55 Crumpets: Examination of these crumpets has yielded nothing to which one can take exception. The fat obtained from them had a low acid value and showed no trace of rancidity. The complaint was not justified. Cases Nos. 111 and 112 Coffee and Chicory Extract: These samples showed no signs of fermentation, as the complainant alleged. There are no yeast cells present nor any development of acidity. The screw caps on the bottles both show traces of mould. It is possible that contents of some bottles have become contaminated from dirty caps. Report of the Public Analyst 37 Case No. 138 Coco-cola: The complaint in this case was that the product contravened the standards of the Food and Drugs Act. Careful examination of this sample has been made, in particular it was tested for preservatives. Nothing was found to which exception can be taken. The article contains a small amount of phosphoric acid, the use of which, in beverages of this kind, is prohibited in some countries and it is because of this that exception to its sale has been raised in some quarters. The complaint was considered not justified. Case No. 782 Sweets: The complainant bought these sweets "off points" to relieve a sore throat and stated that they had caused sickness and vomiting. No substance which could cause these symptoms was detected, although they were scarcely suitable for a demulcent. Case No. 894 Highly coloured sweets: No dyestuffs classed as harmful were detected and the complaint was considered not justified. Case No. 973 Red Currant Syrup: This sample was sent for examination as a possible cause of sickness. No harmful constituent was detected and the sample was passed as genuine. Butter and Margarine The average water content of the 43 samples of butter proved to be 15.3 per cent., that of the 41 samples of margarine 15.2 per cent. The average content of boron preservative in the samples of margarine calculated to boric acid was 0.20 per cent. Mineral Oil Thirty samples of cakes of various kinds were examined for excessive acidity of the fat used, in addition to the routine test for paraffin. In no case was a positive result obtained. 38 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1950 Milk The average composition of the samples of milk submitted during each month of the year and returned as genuine was as under: Month Number Total Solids Milk Fat Non-fatty Solids January 63 12.41% 3.60% 8.81% February 79 12.30% 3.49% 8.81% March 56 12.14% 3.41% 8.73% April 41 12.23% 3.42% 8.81% May 50 12.27% 3.42% 8.85% June 75 12.17% 3.39% 8.78% July 44 12.27% 3.56% 8.71% August 24 12.25% 3.52% 8.73% September 61 12.54% 3.67% 8.87% October 40 12.63% 3.77% 8.86% November 83 12.79% 3.92% 8.87% December 69 12.68% 3.85% 8.83% The average composition of the whole of the 685 samples of milk received during the year and returned as genuine was as under: Total milk solids 12.41 per cent.
