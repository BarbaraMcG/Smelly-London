Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, for the Year 1896. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you. my Twentyseventh Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish. Pursuant to the London (Equalisation of Rates) Act, 1894, a census of London was taken on the night of Sunday, the 29th March, 1896, when the population was estimated at 4,411,271. Our Parish numbered 13,077, a lower number than in the census of 1891. This diminution of the population of the Parish, which has been going on for some time past, is due to the demolition of so many houses, the rebuilding of which is not yet completed, and to the less residential character of the neighbourhood, but on the other hand the day population has enormously increased. 2 Births. The registered Births during the year numbered 221, an increase of 32 over the previous year, 1895. The following Table gives the number of Births registered in each month of the year:— Males Females Total. January 10 13 23 February 9 9 18 March 12 2 14 April 12 9 21 May 7 8 15 June 12 5 17 July 6 14 20 August 11 10 21 September 9 10 19 October 10 7 17 November 8 3 11 December 11 7 18 117 97 214* The Birth-rate of the Parish for the year is 16.9 per 1,000, against 13.0 of the previous year. The birth-rate in London, for the year 1896, was 30.2 per 1,000. * To these 214 Births occurring in the Parish, must be added 7 belonging to St. Martin's which took place at the Bear Yard Receiving Ward, making a total of 221. S"0\AfcX3 3 Deaths. The total Deaths registered in the Parish during the year 1896 were 340, a number 27 less than in the previous year. The following Table gives the number of Deaths registered in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 15 12 27 February 24 10 34 March 19 9 28 April 19 7 26 May 15 7 22 June 17 12 29 July 24 8 32 August 20 7 27 September 18 12 30 October 21 6 27 November 13 11 24 December 25 9 34 230 110 340 These 340 Deaths include those non-parishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital, and must therefore be omitted in estimating the death-rate, but, on the other hand, the deaths occurring in Public Institutions outside the Parish among persons belonging thereto must be added. On referring to Table 7, it will at once make clear what I have just stated. In estimating the Death-rate, I do so in two forms, the first in which are excluded 12 deaths of aged parishioners occurring iu Edmonton Workhouse, they having been resident there many years prior to their death, and in the second form I have included them. a 2 4 Death-rate of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the year 1896, excluding 12 deaths of aged parishioners occurring in the Edmonton Workhouse 15.3 per 1,000 of the estimated population. Death-rate of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the year 1896, including 12 deaths of aged parishioners occurring in the Edmonton Workhouse 16.2 per 1,000 of the estimated population. In London the death-rate for the year 1896 was 18.6 per 1,000. Infantile Mortality. Of the 212 deaths of parishioners occurring within and out of the Parish, 52 were under 5 years of age, equal to 24.5 per cent. of the total deaths. The deaths of Infants under 1 year of age numbered 32, equal to 15.1 per cent. of the total deaths, and 144.8 to 1,000 registered births. In London, for the year 1896, the deaths of Infants under 1 year of age to 1,000 births were 161. Old Age Mortality. The deaths of parishioners over 60 years of age, occurring within and out of the Parish, were 60. 23 were from 60 to 70 years of age. 27 „ „ 70 „ 80 „ 9 „ „ 80 „ 90 „ 1 was ,, 90 ,, 100 ,, „ Causes of Death. Zymotio Diseases.—The principal Zymotic Diseases are Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria. Whooping Cough, Typhoid Fever, Typhus Fever, Puerperal Fever, Cholera, and Diarrhoea. 5 The number of deaths occurring in the Parish from this class of disease was 36. This number includes those nonparishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital. After deducting these, and adding those parishioners who died in Public Institutions outside the Parish, the mortality due to St. Martin's would be 31. Vide Table 5. Small-Pox.—No death was recorded from this complaint, but one case of this disease was notified in accordance with the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which afterwards proved not to be Smallpox, therefore the Parish was quite free from this complaint during the year. Measles.—In the early part of the year this malady was very prevalent; 9 deaths occurred in the Parish, also 1 of an infant parishioner in the Sick Asylum, and 1 in King's College Hospital, making in all 11. Scarlet Fever.—Two deaths from this disease occurred in the Parish, and two in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The number of cases notified during the year was 71, against 42 of the previous year, 1895. Diphtheria.—Three deaths from this disease were recorded as occurring in the Charing Cross Hospital, but they were all nonparishioners, and one death of a parishioner occurred in the University College Hospital and another in the Hospital of the Asylums Board, making only two deaths to the credit of St. Martin's for the year. Whooping Cough.—From this malady 6 deaths were registered, one of which was that of a non-parishioner, and occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital. Typhoid Fever.—Eleven deaths were recorded from this disease, 8 of which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and of the latter number 7 were non-parishioners therefore 4 deaths are to the credit of St. Martin's. 6 Typhus Fever.—No death was recorded from this malady. Puerperal Fever.—One death was registered from this disorder. Cholera.—Nil. Diarrhœa.—Four deaths were registered from Diarrhoea, one of which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital and was that of a non-parishioner, and an infant belonging to St. Martin's died iu St. Giles' Workhouse from this complaint. The deaths from all causes, with the ages at death of those who died in the Parish, and also of those parishioners who died in public institutions outside the district will be found fully detailed in Tables 2 and 6. Inquests. During the year 1896 inquests were held in the Parish in reference to the deaths of 47 persons, of whom 11 were residents, and also 2 inquests were held respecting the deaths of parishioners outside the Parish. The causes which produced death were as follows:— Natural causes 14 Pistol Shot Wound (suicide) 4 Drowning 4 Hanging (suicide) 1 Poison, cocaine (suicide) 1 Bums 1 Suffocation when in bed with mother (infant) . 1 when vomiting 1 Ether, when about to undergo an operation 1 Wound in chest with a dagger (accidental) 1 Injuries to head, no evidence to show how caused 1 Injuries to neck (infant) (wilful murder) 1 „ „ (suicide) 2 7 Inquests—continued. Injuries received from falling down stairs 2 „ „ „ „ the shaft of a lift 1 Injuries received from fall from window 2 „ „ ,, being knocked down by a train 1 Injuries received in the street by a truck 1 ,, „ from being run over or knocked down by vehicles in the street 1 Injuries received from the overturning of a cab 1 ,, ,, when shunting a railway van 1 ,, „ from a fall off a cab 1 „ „ „ falling off a ladder at the Prince of Wales' Theatre 1 Injuries received from being thrown from a van 1 Cause not specified (newly-born infants) 3 49 Notification of Infectious Disease. During the year the number of cases of infectious disease notified was 120 as against 85 of the previous year, 1895. On referring to Table 9 the diseases will be found specified, and the localities are shown where the cases occurred. The fees paid to the Medical Practitioners for forwarding the certificates of these 120 cases amounted to £12 14s. c.d., which sum is repaid to your Vestry by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. About the middle of the year a difficulty was again experienced of procuring admission into the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board of cases of Scarlet Fever, in consequence of a scarcity of beds, due to the prevalence of this complaint in London. 8 Disinfection after Infectious Disease. During the year 109 rooms and their contents were disinfected by your Contractor, Mr. W. G. Lacy, at a cost of £118 lis. 6d. The London County Council on 9th March, 1893, forwarded to your Vestry copies of a report relative to the disinfection and destruction of infected articles, stating they are of opinion in order that the work of disinfection may be under proper supervision, it should be effected on premises belonging to the Vestry, and expressing the hope that the Vestry will provide a steam disinfector, and dispense with the employment of a contractor. This recommendation of the London County Council was by the request of the Public Health Committee referred to me to report upon, which I did in a letter addressed to the Committee as follows:— “To the Public Health Committee of the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. " Gentlemen, " In accordance with your request that I should make a statement in writing in reference to the communication of the Loudon County Council addressed to the Vestry, respecting the necessity of providing premises of our own for the purpose of disinfection after infectious disease, I beg to report as follows:— " When this subject was first brought under the notice of your Committee, I pointed out the impossibility of securing a site in a parish like ours for such a purpose, and even if such a site were secured, the freeholders and the residents in the vicinity would be up in arms, and would very likely land us into a costly litigation. As an alternative, it was suggested by your Committee, that we might ask the Strand Board of Works to allow us to combine with them in the use of their disinfecting premises, I accordingly communicated with the Surveyor of the Strand Board of Works upon the subject, and the reply I received was not of an encouraging nature. 9 "For many years past, the disinfections in the parish have been carried out by Mr. G. Lacy, of St. John's Wharf, Town Mead Road, Fulham, where he has extensive premises for the purpose. These premises are of a very superior kind, consisting of several disinfecting chambers, a cremator for destroying articles that are not worth disinfecting, and a laundry is attached to the establishment for washing infected linen, &c. " I have every reason to be highly satisfied with the manner the disinfections are carried out; had we premises in our own district for the purpose, the work could not be performed more satisfactorily and carefully. " The articles for disinfection are removed from the houses in the parish to the premises at Fulham in a special van. "I am, Gentlemen, " Your obedient Servant,, " (Signed) JOHN J. SKEGG, 30th June, 1896. " Medical Officer of Health." [A copy of this letter was ordered by your Vestry to be forwarded to the London County Council.] The House to House Inspection. This undertaking, though as yet not completed, is progressing satisfactorily, and I trust before long we may be able t'. report the work as finished. I have in previous reports referred to the unforeseen difficulties we have had to contend with, which have required patience and tact on the part of your officers to overcome. The connections of the drains in the Adelphi area to the new sewers have not yet been carried out; this delay has been due to awaiting the result of the action and appeal of the case of the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields v. Ward. The circumstances connected with the case are already known to the members of the Vestry. 10 Appended is a list of those premises where notices and plans have been sent in of intention to lay down new drains since the commencement of this inspection down to the end of March, 1897.

Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Your Analyst, Mr. Percy A. E.

With the exception of 4, those 41 samples were found to be genuine. In one of the adulterated cases, that of milk, a summons was taken out against the vendor, with the result that he was fined 20s. and costs. In the other three cases, also milk, the vendors were simply cautioned by your Clerk, the adulteration not being sufficiently bad to justify a prosecution. The samples were as follows :— Milk 10 samples. Genuine except 4. Butter .. 7 „ Genuine. Flour .. 3 „ „ Ginger 3 „ „ Mustard 3 ,, „ Lard 3 „ ,, Bread 3 „ „ Coffee 3 „ ,, Tinned Meat 3 ,, ,, „ Salmon 3 „ „ 41 Sanitary Notices. Sanitary notices in reference to 192 premises were served upon the owners or occupiers of same. In one case a summons had to be resorted to, but the person responsible for carrying out the work on the service of the summons promised to do the necessary works, and on their completion the summons was withdrawn. 14 Houses Let Out in Lodgings. Your Sanitary Inspector, whom you appointed permanently to inspect these houses, has regularly carried out this duty, and has reported to me all sanitary defects coming under his notice.

Copied from the Registrar- General's Annual Summary of Births, Deaths, and Causes of Death in London for the year 1896.

The net gain in life saved during 1896 was represented by 6,854 lives. In other words, had the average death-rate in 1886-95 continued throughout the year under present notice, 6,854 lives would have been sacrificed in addition to those which have been actually lost by death. In the year 1896 there was, as compared with the decennial average, an excess of 938 deaths from measles, 797 from diphtheria, 256 from whooping cough, 107 from diarrhœal disease, 483 from cancer, 151 from premature birth, and 108 from accident. Under each of the other headings in the table the mortality in 1896 was below the average. This was notably the case in regard to diseases of the respiratory system, the deaths referred to which were 5,030 below the annual average.
