The Mayor issued an appeal to residents in the Borough for contributions for that purpose, and a Public Meeting was held at the Wandsworth Town Hall on the 26th January, 1911, at which the following resolution was passed, viz.:— "That the proposed memorial should take the form of some visible and tangible monument (whether a statue, fountain, arch, or other structure), with appropriate inscription, the particular kind of monument to be determined by the Mayor and a Committee to be formed by him, when the amount of subscriptions is approximately ascertained, but such memorial to be of British manufacture, British material, and designed by British artists." 28. Other Meetings were held in the Borough, and a sum of over £600 has been subscribed. The Committee appointed at the Meeting held at the Wandsworth Town Hall decided that the Memorial should take the form of a Statue of the late King Edward and should be placed at Tooting Broadway. The Council approved of the position suggested, and the Committee having inspected several designs accepted the offer of Mr. L. F. Roselieb, of Grafton Square, Clapham, to provide and erect the Memorial at the Tooting Broadway. Endeavours will be made for the statue to be completed and fixed early in November next. 37 Death of Prince Francis of Teck. 29.

"The high character of Prince Francis and the energy shown by him in connection with the work of the Middlesex Hospital and other philanthropic institutions and movements were greatly valued by your Majesties' subjects, who are sincerely grieved at his death. "With the greatest devotion and respect, we remain, "Your Majesties' dutiful subjects, "ARCHIBALD D. DAWNAY, Mayor. "HEN. GEO, HILLS, Town Clerk 3« 31. The following reply was received from the Home Secretary:— "Home Office, Whitehall, "8th November, 1910 "Sir, "I have had the honour to lay before the King and the Queen the loyal and dutiful Address of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, expressing condolence with Their Majesties on the death of His Serene Highness Prince Francis of Teck, and I have to inform you that Their Majesties were pleased to receive the same very graciously. "I am, Sir, "Your obedient Servant, (Signed) WINSTON S. CHURCHILL. The Town Clerk, Council House, Wandsworth, S.W." Post Office. 32. In June last the Council petitioned the PostmasterGeneral to provide a Post Office for Wandsworth suitable for the needs of the town and solely devoted to postal duties. In reply the PostmasterGeneral stated that the postal and telegraph arrangements at present afforded in the parish of Wandsworth were considered to be sufficient for the needs of the public, and that he regretted that he was unable to meet the Council's request for the establishment of a Post Office on premises devoted to post office work alone; and that it was found that the benefits accruing from such an arrangement would be altogether out of proportion to the considerable expenditure involved. The Council asked the Postmaster-General to reconsider the subject and called the attention of Sir Henry Kimber, M.P., to the matter. In reply to a question in the House of Commons by Sir Henry Kimber the PostmasterGeneral stated that the facilities at present afforded were considered sufficient and that there did not appear that there was any necessity for additional Sunday facilities. A similar reply was given to the Council's letter asking for the matter to be reconsidered. 39 Disorderly Houses. 33. Proceedings taken by the Council with respect to disorderly houses resulted in the following convictions being obtained, viz.:—For keeping a brothel and living on the earnings of an immoral woman, three months' imprisonment with hard labour; for keeping a brothel, three months' imprisonment with hard labour; for permitting a house to be used for habitual prostitution, fined £10 and £,2 2s. costs; and for allowing a boy, 10 years of age, to be upon the premises, fined £10, with the alternative of one month's imprisonment in each case, to run consecutively. Writing on Pavements. 34. The following Bye-Law was made by the Council on the 8th March last, viz.:— "No person shall deface the footway of any street by writing or other marks." PENALTY. "Any person who shall offend against the foregoing Byelaw shall be "liable for every such offence to a fine not exceeding Forty Shillings." Quinquennial valuation. 35. In accordance with the provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, the new Valuation List was duly made and deposited on the 31st May, 1910. The following is an extract from the report of the Rating Committee on the final approval of the List by the Assessment Committee:— 2—(a) We beg to report that the Union Assessment Committee have finally approved the new Valuation List, which will (subject to appeals to Quarter Sessions) come into operation on the 6th April, 1911.

The following Parliamentary Bills were considered by the Council, viz.:— London County Council (General Powers). London County Council (Tramways and Improvements). Coroners' Law and Deaths Certification (Amendment). London Electric Supply. Municipal Representation. Milk and Dairies. Education (Administrative Provisions). Music and Dancing. Representation of the People. Shops (No. 2). Water Supplies Protection. Daylight Saving. Local Authorities (Advertising Municipal Elections. 41 London County Council (General Powers). 36. Part IV. of this Bill contained provisions for the regulation of lamps, structures, etc., in front of buildings and proposed to authorise the County Council to consent to or require the removal of any case, board, stall, awning, or other thing used for the display of articles or advertisement which extends beyond the exterior of any building and beyond the general line, or overhangs the public way. Part V. proposed to repeal the existing provisions with respect to the manufacture and sale of ice creams, and contained new provisions, and provided that proceedings might be taken by the County Council in case of default by the Sanitary Authorities. Clause 31 would have required the consent of the County Council to the construction of subways or passages under streets. Clause 32 extended the provisions of section 3 of the Metropolis Management (Amendment) Act, 1890, so as to enable Metropolitan Borough Councils to execute necessary works of repair to footways as well as to carriageways, and to recover the expense thereof from the adjoining owners. This clause was inserted upon the suggestion of this Council. Clause 33 proposed to amend section 205 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, so as to make employers liable for damage done by their servants to property belonging to Councils. This Council presented a petition against the provisions of Part IV., asked for the substitution of the Borough Councils for the County Council in clause 31, and approved of the provisions of clauses 32 and 33. Councillors Cundall and A. D. Robinson, M.A., LL.B., attended on behalf of this Council, a Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils, at which the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— 1—That this Conference of representatives of the Metropolitan Borough Councils emphatically protests against the unnecessary encroachments upon the powers and duties of the Metropolitan Borough Councils contained in the London County Council (General Powers) Bill of the present session of Parliament. 2—That in the opinion of this Conference, Clause 19 (Regulations and control of certain lamps, structures, etc.), and Clause 20 (Council may require the removal of cases, boards, etc.) of the Bill are particularly objectionable in so far as they seek to confer powers on the London County Council at present exercisable by the Borough Councils with regard to certain projections on or over the public way, more especially as the matters referred to in Clause 19 are sufficiently provided for by Section 164 of the London Building Act, 1894, which empowers the London County Council to make Bye-laws in respect thereof, and vests the administration of such Bye-laws in the Borough Councils. 42 3.—That this Conference is strongly opposed to the proviso to Clause 25, Part V. of the Bill (Ice Cream), which provides, in case of default by the Sanitary Authority, that the County Council may take proceedings as in a case under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Conference being of opinion that the granting of this power to the London County Council is unnecessary and derogatory to the Borough Councils. 4—That this Conference is of opinion that Clause 31 of the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1911, should be strenuously opposed by the Metropolitan Borough Councils unless the Borough Councils are made the sole Authorities to exercise the powers sought in the clause in question. 37. Part IV. of the Bill was opposed before the Committee of the House of Commons by this and other Borough Councils and others, and the Committee intimated that they were unanimously of opinion that that part of the Bill should not be proceeded with, and that the matters dealt with should not be under the sole control of the County Council. Part V. (which related to ice cream), which was also objected to by this Council, was withdrawn. The Town Clerk gave evidence in support of clause 32, and the clause was passed by the Committee. Clause 33 was opposed by omnibus companies, and was struck out. The Bill as amended was passed, and received the Royal assent on the 18th August. London County Council (Tramways and Improvements). 38. This Bill proposed to authorise the County Council to construct and work new tramways, to alter and reconstruct existing tramways, widen streets, and carry out other works. The Bill did not include any new tramways or reconstruction of tramways in this Borough. Clause 21 authorises the County Council to acquire and use for the purposes of its tramways the premises known as 31, Streatham Hill. The County Council agreed to the suggestion of this Council that a strip of land in front of the premises should be given up and added to the public way. Clause 27 extended for two years from the passing of the Bill the time limited for the compulsory purchase of land at High Street and York Road, Wandsworth. Clause 31 proposed to authorise the County Council to erect shelters or waiting rooms for tramway passengers, and with the consent of the road authority to use for that purpose portions of the streets. Clause 35 proposed to authorise the County Council to attach to any lamp-posts, poles, standards, or similar erections, on highways on or near to the route of any tramways signs indicating the position of stopping places. The Conference which considered the General Powers Bill 43 above referred to also considered this Bill, and were of opinion that clause 31 should be so amended as to enable the road authorities to attach conditions to their consent to the use of portions of streets for shelters, and to require the removal of such sheltersif deemed necessary, and that the provisions of clause 35 were objectionable, and should be amended so that the attachments in question shall not be made except with the consent and approval of the local authority; that such consent shall not constitute a perpetual easement; that the proposed signs shall be maintained by the County Council, and that complete protection should be given to the Borough Councils with regard to the maintenance and control of lamp-posts. This Council and four other Councils appeared before the Committee of the House of Commons in opposition to clause 35, when the London County Council intimated that the clause would be amended so as to provide that the County Council shall indemnify the owner of lamps against any damage occasioned by any attachment, and that nothing in the clause should be deemed to require the owner to retain any lamp when not required for his purpose. With those amendments the clause was allowed to proceed, and the Bill received the Royal assent on the 18th August. Coroners' Law and Deaths Certification (Amendment). 3g. The object of this Bill was to amend the law relating to Coroners and Death Certification so as to give effect to many of the recommendations of the Departmental Committee of 1908 and of the Death Certification Committee of 1893. This Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, which was, however, dropped. London Electric Supply. 40. The London Electric Supply Act, 1908, constituted the London County Council the purchasing authority (in lieu of the Borough Councils) in respect of the undertakings of nine of the fourteen companies authorised to supply electricity in London. Under the provisions of the present Bill the County Council will become the purchasing authority with respect to the undertakings of the remaining five companies, but they will not be able to purchase the undertaking of one company without purchasing the undertakings of all. The Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, which received the Royal assent on the 28th November, 1910. 44 Municipal Be presentation. 41. The Council presented a petition in favour of this Bill, which was to allow Municipal Authorities to adopt for their elections a system of proportional representation. The Bill was not proceeded with. Milk and Dairies. 42. The main objects of this Bill were to provide for the more effective registration of dairies and dairymen; the inspection of dairies and the examination of cows, the prohibition of milk from a dairy which would be likely to cause infectious disease; and the issue of regulations for securing the supply of pure and wholesome milk. This Council petitioned against the provisions of the Bill, which would have conferred on the Local Government Board extensive powers of making orders and regulations, and disposing of matters which are at present dealt with by magistrates, and the transfer of certain powers of Borough Councils to the County Council. The Council approved of clause 8 of the Bill, which provided that a warranty or invoice should not be available as a defence in proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act with respect to to milk. The Bill did not reach second reading. Education (Administrative Provisions). 43. This Bill proposed to remove from the Education Authority the final responsibility of deciding whether a child was or was not underfed, and to impose that duty upon the school doctor, the Medical Officer of Health, or other medical official. The Council petitioned against the Bill, which was not proceeded with. Music and Dancing. 44. This Bill was promoted by the London County Council, and its object was to effect an amendment of the law relating to licences for music and dancing in the administrative County of London as contained in the Disorderly Houses Acts, 1751 and 1818, and the Public Entertainments Act, 1875, in order to enable the London County Council (which is the authority to grant such licences in the County) to grant such licences at any time during the year, instead of being limited as at present to an annual licensing meeting now held in the month of November. This Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, which, however, was not proceeded with. 45 Representation of the People- 45. This Bill was again introduced by Sir Henry Kimber, Bart., M.P., its object being to make the representation of the people in the House of Commons more nearly proportioned to population. The Council petitioned in favour of the measure, but the Bill did not reach second reading. Shops 'No. 2). 46. This Bill was introduced by the Home Secretary, and proposed to amend and extend the Shops Regulation Acts, 1892 to 1904. The Council petitioned against the Bill, objecting particularly to provisions which would, in London, authorise the County Council to exercise the powers of Sanitary Authorities with reference to the ventilation and the provision of sanitary convenience in shops, being of opinion that matters should remain under the jurisdiction of the Borough Councils. The Bill was withdrawn. Water Supplies Protection. 47. The object of this Bill was to prohibit water undertakers sinking wells or constructing works unless such wells and works have been expressly approved by Parliament; to provide that where private supplies are injured by the abstraction of water for public supply the owner shall be entitled to compensation; and that any district from or through which water is conveyed shall be entitled to demand a share of such water for its own needs. The Council presented a petition in favour of the Bill. The Bill was considered by a Select Committee of the House of Lords, but did not reach the House of Commons. 48. No action was taken with reference to the other Bills above mentioned. Sir George Newnes, Bart. 49. The Council regrets to record the death, on the 8th June, 1910, of Sir George Newnes, But., who presented the Newnes Public Library to the Borough. A fund was raised by a Committee of residents with the view of providing a memorial and the Council, in March, 1911, accepted from such Committee a bust of Sir George, which has been placed in the corridor of the Newnes Library. 46 Bye Laws- Sanitary Conveniences. 50. Bye-laws with respect to the decent conduct of persons^ using the public lavatories and sanitary conveniences provided and maintained by the Council within the Borough have been made, and approved by the Local-' Government Board. Regulations— Underground Rooms. 51. Regulations under section 17, sub-section (7) (p) of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, with regard to underground rooms habitually used as sleeping places have also been made by the Council. 52. Other information relating to public health is contained in the Medical Officer's Report, Appendix H. Metropolitan Paving Committee. 53. Alderman Hewett has been re-appointed as this. Council's representative on the Metropolitan Paving Committee. Overhanging Lamps. &c. 54. The Council has again had under consideration the question of the regulation of lamps, signs, and other structures overhanging the public way. Applications were made to the County Council by the Borough Councils of Lambeth and Fulham for regulations to be made for administration by the Borough Councils, and this Council was asked to support such applications. After consideration of all the circumstances, this Council came to the conclusion that it is not desirable for regulations to be made such as those suggested, and the respective Borough Councils were so informed. Speed limit for motor traffic. 55. The Borough Council, upon further consideration, decided not to proceed with the proposal referred to in last year's report (page 53, par. 65), that a regulation should be made limiting the speed of motor traffic along High Street, Putney, to 10 miles an hour. The Council, however, recently re-considered the matter, and in reply to a communication from the London County Council decided to inform that Council that, in the opinion of the Borough Council, the circumstances of the case made it desirable that application should be made to the Local Government Board for the imposition of a reduced speed limit in High Street, Putney. Complaints 47 also received during the year of danger caused by the excessive speed at which motor vehicles travelled along Streatham High Road and Mitcham Lane. After full consideration the Council came to the conclusion that it was not desirable that any reduction should be made in the speed limit for motor traffic there, the subject of the complaints being a matter which, in the view of the Council, should be dealt with by the police. Boiler Skating in Streets. 56. In view of a fatal accident said to have been caused by roller skating in High Street, Clapham, the Borough Council repeated its application, made to the London County Council in April, 1910, for a Bye-Law to be made dealing with roller skating in streets. The County Council has not, however, yet made the proposed Bye-Law. Woodpaving Fund. 57. During the financial year ended 31st March last, woodpaving works were carried out in a number of main roads in the Borough. The cost of these works was £14,965, which, together with the sum of £3,337 for repayment of, and interest upon, loans in respect of works carried out in former years, was borne by the Woodpaving, &c (Short Loans Substitution) Fund. As reported last year the sum of £3,000 was allocated to the Fund from the ordinary estimates, but even with this assistance there was only the small balance of £650 to the credit of the Fund at the end of the year. In view of the extensive woodpaving works required to be executed in the near future in connection with the construction of tramways, and the expense of ordinary repairs and renewals, the Council decided to increase the rate levied for the purposes of the Fund from 1½d. to 2d. in the so as to place it on a more satisfactory footing. It was, however, found possible to make such a reduction in the ordinary estimates of the Highways Committee for 1911-12, that the increase in the rate for the Woodpaving Fund will not increase the total amount of the rate to be raised for the Committee's purposes for the current year. Mitcham Lane, Southeroft Road, and Wimbledon Road Tramways. 58. The construction of the London County Council tramways in Mitcham Lane and Southeroft Road and along Wimbledon Road referred to in last year'sreport (pages 56 and 57, pars. 76 and 77), has been completed. The lines, after inspection by the Board o£ 48 Trade, were opened for traffic in November last. The London County Council having found it impracticable to carry out the proposed improvement at the corner of Mitcham Lane and Babington Road in accordance with the deposited Parliamentary plan, a fresh line of widening at this point was agreed between the Borough Council and the County Council. Nearly. all the widenings required in connection with these tramways have been effected. Steps are being taken by the County Council with the view of executing the remaining improvement at an early date. Southfield Tramways. 59. The Borough Council has on several occasions during the past year had before it the subject of the suggested provision by the London County Council of a line of tramways between High Street, Wandsworth, and Southfield. During recent years extensive building operations have taken place in the district immediately westward of Merton Road, and a large residential population has sprung up there. On the eastern side of Merton Road, and at the southern end of that road adjoining the County boundary, there still remain tracts of land awaiting development. Means of communication between this district and other parts of London are at present limited, and a tramway connection with the County Council's existing system would be of great benefit to the residents. Two alternative routes have been suggested for the proposed tramways from High Street, Wandsworth. One would follow Merton Road throughout to the County boundary, and the other would leave Merton Road at the junction of Wimbledon Park Road and follow the latter road to Southfield railway station. The Borough Council has received deputations on two occasions in favour of the former route, and representations in support of that proposal were made to the Borough Council from a largely-attended public meeting of residents in the district affected. After careful consideration of all the circumstances, the Borough Council came to the conclusion that the route following the Merton Road to the County boundary was the most suitable for the proposed tramway. 60. The views of the Borough Council on the subject were communicated to the London County Council and a deputation, consisting of the Mayor (Alderman Dawnay, J.P.), Councillors 49 Garrett, Jackson and Wise, attended before a Sub-Committee of the County Council in support of the Borough Council's proposal. The matter is now under the consideration of the County Council. Clapham Park Road Tramways. 61. The London County Council had under consideration during the past year a proposal to construct a tramway from Clapham Cross to Brixton, via Clapham Park Road and Acre Lane, and suggested a conference with representatives of the Borough Council on the subject. After further consideration, however, the County Council dropped the proposal and the conference was not therefore necessary. Bedford Hill. 62. With the view of improving the part of Bedford Hill, Balham, adjoining Tooting Common, the Borough Council filled in the ditch and formed a footpath alongside the road, and provided the necessary gullies. The London County Council surrendered the strip of the Common required for the improvement, but declined to make any contribution towards the cost of the work. High Street, Clapham, widening. 63. The setting back of the projecting buildings between Nos. 82 and 98, High Street, Clapham, has been completed and the land added to the public way paved. The total cost of the widening was £3,627 5s. 4.d. The London County Council promised to contribute one-third of the cost, the contribution not to exceed the sum of £1,167. Lacy Road, Putney, widening. 64. The widening of Lacy Road, Putney, in connection with the erection of buildings on the site of Grove Cottage, referred to in last year's report (page 58, par. 85), has been completed at a total cost of £150 7s. 7d. Merton Road Widening. 65. The widening of Merton Road, Southfield, in front of Burr Terrace and St. Barnabas Terrace, has now been completed. The total cost of the improvement was as follows, viz.:- Burr Terrace, £301 19s. 11d. St. Barnabas Terrace, £272 16s. 7d.; total, £574 16s. 6d. The Improvements Committee of the London County Council intimated that they were willing to recommend that Council to contribute two-thirds (not exceeding £182) of the cost of the 50 widening at St. Barnabas Terrace, subject to the Borough Council agreeing to contribute one-third of the nett cost of the widening by the County Council of Wimbledon Park Road, between St. Michael's Church and Standen Road. The Borough Council did not, however, see its way to agree to this condition, as the latter improvement was only necessary in the event of tramways being constructed there, and the Borough Council was of opinion that Merton Road was the more suitable route for such tramways. The County Council was not asked to contribute towards the cost of the widening at Burr Terrace. Mitcham Boad Widening. 66. Proposals made to the Borough Council with regard to the sale of the two pieces of surplus land in Mitcham Road, Tooting, acquired in connection with the widening of that road, were dealt with by the London County Council as that Council is contributing two-thirds of the cost of the improvement. The County Council was not, however, able to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion, and the land is still in hand. Putney to Wandsworth Tramways. 67. Under the London County Council (Tramways and Improvements) Act, 1910, the County Council obtained powers to construct tramways along High Street, Putney, Putney Bridge Road, and High Street, Wandsworth, to connect the existing tramways at Putney with those in York Road, Wandsworth. The overhead system of traction will be adopted in High Street, Putney, and in Putney Bridge Road, the remainder of the route being worked on the underground conduit system. Owing to the extensive widenings which will be necessary in High Street, Wandsworth, the County Council decided to proceed first with the construction of the part of the line between Putney Bridge and the southern end of Putney Bridge Road. The approval of the Board of Trade was obtained to the proposals with regard to this section, and the works are now in hand. With the exception of the part of the road by the railway bridge near Point Pleasant, the tramway tracks will be paved with wood, the Borough Council agreeing to pave the remainder of the carriage-way with wood within two years of the completion of the works executed by the County Council. 51 Granite setts will be used for paving the whole width of the road by the above-mentioned railway bridge. Arrangements have been made for a double line of tramways to be laid, with the exception of a short length near Brewhouse Lane. The County Council was urged to construct this section also as a double line but, to the regret of the Borough Council the County Council found it impossible to adopt the suggestion. This is the only part of the tramway constructed as a single line. One-third of the total nett cost of the necessary widenings will be defrayed by the Borough Council, and the County Council will contribute two-thirds of the cost of the improvements recently carried out by the Borough Council in Putney Bridge Road. Roe Bridge Widening. 68. At the request of the Borough Council the London County Council, by arrangement with the Surrey County Council, has now carried out the widening- of Roe Bridge, carrying Mitcham Lane over the river Graveney at the County boundary. Streatham High Road. 69. The total cost of the paving and other works for which this Council was responsible, executed in Streatham High Road in connection with the construction of tramways there, was £14,251 gs. 10d., exclusive of certain work at Streatham Common which has not yet been carried out, owing to the County Council not having given the necessary consent. 70. The London County Council having declined to give permission to the Borough Council to round off the corner of Streatham Common at the junction of Streatham Common North and Streatham High Road, until the proposed improvement at the opposite corner of Streatham Common North has been effected, the Borough Council asked the County Council to carry out the latter widening in accordance with the agreement entered into between the County Council and the Borough Council in connection with the construction of tramways along Streatham High Road. The Borough Council was informed in reply that the Improvements Committee of the County Council were of opinion that it would not be advisable to take any steps at present to acquire the property needed for the improvement at the junction 52 of the northern side of Streatham Common North with the eastern side of Streatham High Road, as it appeared likely that an application would be made for the County Council's approval of plans for the development of the property, when the land needed could probably be secured free of cost. 71. The London County Council also adhered to its refusal to allow the Borough Council to form a proper footpath on the western side of Streatham High Road where it abuts upon Streatham Common. 72. These matters will continue to receive the attention of the Borough Council. 73. The London County Council having adopted the Borough Council's suggestion, mentioned in last year's report (page 55, par. 71), that a widening of Streatham High Road, near the Norbury tramway terminus, should be effected in connection with the proposed erection of buildings there, the Borough Council agreed to contribute one-third of the nett cost of the improvement. The matter is now being dealt with by the County Council. Summerstown Improvement. 74. By arrangement with the owner, the forecourts of Nos. 46 to 60, Summerstown, Wandsworth, have been added to the public way and a new footpath formed and paved. The total cost of the improvement was £109 8s. 9d. Road Board Schemes. 75. The Council, at the invitation of the Road Board, submitted the following schemes to the Board, and asked what contributions under the provisions of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act the Board would be prepared to make in respect of the cost thereof, in the event of the Council deciding to carry out the work, viz.:— (a) Trial of samples of road binding materials in Upper Richmond Road, Putney, between Roehampton Lane and Priory Lane, and the kerbing and widening of the footpath on the northern side of the road (partly in Barnes District) in connection therewith. (b) Tar-spraying main roads in the Borough. 53 The last mentioned proposal was not, however, entertained by the Road Board. With regard to (a) the Road Board suggested that a trial should be made in Kingston Road, Putney Vale, of various methods of re-surfacing roads, the Borough Council making the necessary arrangements for the execution of the work and the maintenance of the several sections for specified periods, and the Road Board contributing three-fourths of the cost of construction. The estimated cost of carrying out the works is £1,930. The Borough Council agreed to this proposal and the works have now been completed. Upper Richmond Road Improvements. 76. The Council has also under consideration a proposal for the diversion of Upper Richmond Road, Putney, at the County boundary at Priests' Bridge, by the construction of a new road across private property, so as to abolish the sharp corners in the road there. The larger part of the improvement is in the County of Surrey, and the Council is in communication with other authorities affected with the view of the scheme being- submitted to the Road Board in the near future. 77. In connection with the woodpaving of Upper Richmond Road, between Roehampton Lane and Priory Lane, the Borough Council is endeavouring to make arrangements with the Barnes Urban District Council for narrow strips of Barnes Common to be added to the public way in order to make the path adjoining the Common of an uniform width. 78. The owner of Nos. 191 to 203, Upper Richmond Road, Putney, having given notice of his intention to convert those premises into shops, the Borough Council took the opportunity of effecting a widening of the road in front, in accordance with the plan approved some years ago. As the alterations to the buildings were about to be proceeded with, and satisfactory terms could not be arranged with the owner, it became necessary for the Council to put in force its powers for the compulsory acquisition of the strip of land. When the matter came before the jury the compensation estimated by the claimant's witnesses varied from £2,886 54 to £3,216, and the jury awarded £1,750. The Council's sealed offer was £500. The purchase having been completed, the land was thrown into the public way, and the necessary paving works executed at a cost of about £330. Warple Way and Fairfield Street Widening. 79. Under the provisions of the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Act, 1900, an improvement has been effected at the corner of Warple Way and Fairfield Street, Wandsworth, the Gas Company giving up a strip of land, and erecting a new wall at their works, and the Borough Council executing the necessary paving and other works. York Road Widening 81. The widening of York Road, which is being carried out by the Borough Council by arrangement with the London County Council, is now nearing completion. The necessary steps are being taken for the acquisition of the few outstanding interests in the property required. The London County Council has decided to widen the footpath on the northern side of the road, between Jews' Row and Bridgend Road, by acquiring the forecourts of the shops there and throwing the same into the public way. The Borough Council has agreed to contribute one-third of the actual cost of this improvement. Tooting Bec Ro.ad Obstruction. 81. The Council has for some time past been endeavouring to secure the removal of a projecting fence in Tooting Bec Road, Balham, between Stapleton Road and Romberg Road. The owner of the adjoining premises claimed the fence as his property, and the Council found it necessary to proceed under Michael Angelo Taylor's Act. The fence was ultimately removed by the Council as an obstruction without payment of compensation and the site paved as part of the public way. Footpath across WandsworthCommon. 82. The Borough Council has for a long time past been in correspondence with the London County Council with the view of the footpath across Wandsworth Common between Trinity Road and Wandsworth Common railway station being tarpaved. The footpath is much used, and many complaints were received of its unsatisfactory condition The County Council having arranged for the part of the 55 path within the Borough of Battersea to be tarpaved, the Borough Council agreed to tarpave and maintain in future at its own expense the part of the path within this Borough. The paving works in question have now been executed. Unemployment. 83. During the past year the following works, upon which unemployed workmen were engaged, were carried out in conjunction with the Central (Unemployed) Body for London, viz.:— WORK. COST. Unskilled labour. Materials, skilled labour and supervision. Total. £ s. d. £ s. d. £ s d. Widening of looting Bec Road between The Avenue and Elmbourne Road †541 1 11½ 1,537 3 4 2,078 5 3½ Widening and embanking a further portion of the river Wandle at Garratt Park shoot 322 0 8 66 18 10 388 19 6 Laying out part of old Garratt Lane (Tooting Grove) slop shoot as a recreation ground 409 16 8½ 189 10 2 599 6 10½ 6† Includes an amount of £10 for extra work of shifting fence and extra kerbing and gullies. The expense of the materials, skilled labour, and supervision was borne by the Borough Council. The Borough Council also, at the request of the Local Government Board, made a contribution of £100 towards the cost of the unskilled labour in connection with the work carried out at the old Garratt Lane slop shoot. The unskilled labour employed upon the three schemes was provided by the Central Body and, with the exception of the £100 mentioned above, the cost thereof borne by that Body. The London County Council surrendered the strips of Tooting Common required for the Tooting Bec Road improvement. 84. In connection with the work at the old Garratt Lane (Tooting Grove) slop shoot, the Borough Council arranged for the D 56 planting with shrubs of the site of a right of way reserved to the Metropolitan Asylums Board over part of the site which adjoins their hospital in Tooting Grove. 85. The Vacant Land Cultivation Society still has the use' of several pieces of vacant land belonging to the Council, in various parts of the Borough, for cultivation by the unemployed and other persons of small means, under the direction of the Society. Overhead Telegraph Lines. 86. During recent years the Council has received many complaints from residents in the Borough of the erection by the Post Office Authorities of telegraph poles and wires in the streets. The Council endeavours to arrange for the laying of the wires underground in cases where their erection on poles would be likely to cause obstruction and annoyance, and has been successful in preventing poles being fixed where they would have been most undesirable. Recently the Council withheld its consent to the erection of poles in a number of streets, and suggested to the Post Office Authorities that underground lines would be more suitable in the localities affected. The PostmasterGeneral stated, however, that he felt bound, acting as he did in the interests of the public, to press for the Council's consent to overhead lines in the following roads, viz.:— (a) In Welham Road, Streatham, between Rectory Lane and Salterford Road ; (b) In Wimbledon Park Road, Southfield, from existing overhead line there to existing overhead line in Granville Road; (c) In Putney Bridge Road, Southfield, between Deodar Road and 137, Putney Bridge Road; (d) In Station Road and Fernlea Road, Balham; Emmanuel Road and Haverhill Road, Clapham South, from a point in Station Road near the junction of Culmore Road to a point in Haverhill Road near the junction of Midmoor Road; (g) In Burntwood Lane, Springfield, from a point near Garratt Lane to the junction of Tranmere Road. It was stated that if the required consent were not forthcoming a difference would be deemed to have arisen between the Postmaster-General and the Council which would have to be 57 determined by a Police Magistrate, and, on appeal, by the Railway Commissioners, and with the view of an amicable settlement being arrived at, a Conference was arranged between the Town Clerk, the Borough Engineer and the Solicitor, and the Solicitor and one of the Assistant Secretaries to the Post Office, to discuss the subject. The matter received careful consideration and ultimately the Council, in view of all the circumstances, decided not to object to the proposals of the Post Office, subject to the following conditions, viz.:— (a) That the proposed telegraph lines in Station Road, across Bedford Hill, Balham, and across Putney Bridge Road, Southfield, opposite Deodar Road, be placed underground. (b) That the poles in Welham Road, Streatham, Putney Bridge Road, Southfield, Fernlea Road, Balham, Emmanuel Road and Haverhill Road,. Clapham South, and Burntwood Lane, Springfield, be of creosoted wood, the lower part of the poles to be lagged with painted wooden laths, and the poles to be similar in every respect to the specimen pole erected opposite the Council House in 1908. (c) That the poles in Wimbledon Park Road, Southfield, be of iron. (d) That the poles in Emmanuel Road be placed in the kerb of the footpath on the side of the road nearest Tooting Common. (e) That, in the event of tramways being constructed on an overhead system of traction along Wimbledon Park Road, Putney Bridge Road, or Burntwood Lane, the telegraph wires in those roads shall, if the Postmaster-General has power and can obtain consent, be shifted to the tramway poles, and the telegraph poles removed. (f) That the poles, wires, and fire alarm posts be placed in such positions and the underground wires laid at such depths as may be agreed between the Borough Engineer and the representative of the Postmaster-General on the ground, and that the whole of the works be carried out to the satisfaction of the Borough Engineer. (g) That no part of any wire over any road or footway shall at any time be at a less height than twenty-five feet above such road or footway. (h) That not more than twenty-four wires be placed on any one pole, and that in the event of wires in excess of that number being required, the Postmaster-General shall, subject to the consent of the Council, construct an underground line along that portion of the route on which such greater number is required, in lieu of the corresponding portion of the overhead route, and shall, without prejudice to the question whether such poles and wires, or any of them, should be retained or re-erected for telephone distribution purposes, remove all such poles and wires. 58 (i) That where the telegraph poles, fire-alarm posts, and underground, wires are placed in parish roads under the care of the Council, the work of permanently reinstating the public way repairable by the Council be executed by the Council, and the cost thereof repaid by the Post Office authorities, in accordance with the scale of prices agreed to in the letters from the Postmaster-General, dated 9th May, 1903, and 4th April, 1908. In connection with this matter, it may be mentioned that in several recent cases in other Boroughs where the local authority objected altogether to the erection of overhead telegraph lines, the Postmaster-General, on appeal, obtained the necessary permission to place the wires overhead in the streets referred to in his application, his offer to compromise the matter by laying some of the wires underground having been refused. In some cases an order was made for the wires to be placed underground if the local authority would pay the additional expense. Southfield Slop Shoot. 87. Arrangements have been made with the owner of adjoining land for the straightening of the irregular boundary at the southern end of the Council's Southfield slop shoot. The exchange of lands was effected by an order of the Board of Agriculture. The old boundary followed the old course of the river Wandle, and this has been filled in and a fence erected on the new boundary. Sulina Road Depot. 88. The Council having discontinued the use of the small depot in Sulina Road, Streatham, held under agreement expiring Lady Day, 1912, arrangements were made for the Council to be released from the agreement, and possession of the depot was given up in March last. Conference on Educational Matters. 89. The annual Conference on educational matters between Members of the London County Council and Managers of Public Elementary Schools in the Battersea, Clapham, and Wandsworth Electoral Divisions, to which the Members of this Council's Education Committee were also invited, was held in November. A number of Resolutions were passed and forwarded to the London County Council, among them being one on the subject of the cost of education, in which it was suggested that the greater proportion ot the cost of national education should be met by increased Government grants. 59 New Schools. 90. Notice has been received from the London County Council of its intention to erect a new school for about 1,000 children, on part of the Furzedown site West Streatham, and to apply for statutory powers of purchase over a site for a school in Derinton Road, Tooting. London County Council Education Committee. 91. In view of the very large area and population of the Division, this Council passed a resolution requesting, the London County Council to appoint on its Education Committee a Member resident in the County Council Electoral Division of Wandsworth, and therefore acquainted with the educational needs of that Division. The County Council stated in reply that in appointing its Committees it was the practice to consult the wishes of Members, and that, with regard to the co-opted Members of the Committee, in the absence of any other qualification than residence in a particular locality, a person would not be eligible for co-option, and that the Council's letter would receive further consideration at the next re-appointment of Committees. A copy of the correspondence with the County Council was forwarded to the Chairman of each body of Managers in the Division, and a number of Managers expressed their concurrence in the resolution, and communicated their views to the County Council. Powers and Duties of Managers. 92. The Council has again urged the desirability of increasing the powers and duties of Managers, but was informed that the appropriate Committee of the County Council who considered this Council's communication did not see their way to recommend the County Council to take any action in the matter. School Managers. 93. The triennial appointment of this Council's representatives on the Bodies of Managers of Provided and Non-provided Schools in the Borough took place in November, 1910, the appointments being for the three years ending December, 1913. The question of applying to the appointments conditions as to the attendances of Managers and visits to Schools was considered, but the Council did not think it expedient to adopt such conditions. 6o Apprenticeships. 94. The Education Committee considered, on the motion of Councillor Renshaw, the subject of Apprenticeships, and submitted the following report thereon, which was adopted by the Council, viz.:— (a) We are of opinion that a constructive scheme should be carefully elaborated by the Education Authority that will enable deserving boys and girls to learn under proper conditions, directly they leave school a trade or suitable occupation which the parents should select where possible. (b) To do this we are of opinion that for apprentices the school age should be raised to the age considered necessary in each trade to learn that particular trade and to complete the apprenticeship. (c) That either premium agreements or trade apprenticeships in masters' and manufacturers' workshops and jobs should be instituted, so that the boy or girl can learn the trade or occupation chosen in working conditions and under the supervision of the employers' own foremen. (d) That hours of labour suitable to the trade chosen can readily be arranged 1with employers, it being an essential condition that time shall be allowed where desired for afternoon classes on one or two days a week, so that theory can be taught hand in hand with practice. (e) We suggest that boys or girls who gain Scholarship rewards should first have the option of choosing a scholastic or a trade training; where a trade is chosen an apprenticeship with an approved employer could be entered into for an agreed term of years. (f) We suggest for the consideration of the Education Authority that the Scholarship rewards to such children should be an apprenticeship or premium fund tor payment to the employers of a suitable premium according to the trade chosen, such premium being returned in the form of weekly wages. (g) We suggest that children other than those who gain Scholarships should have the same privileges as far as vacancies and trades can be found, but in their case the premium, if any, should be advanced by the Education Authority, and refunded in whole or in part by the parents by agreed instalments. (h) That apprentices should work the hours customary in the chosen trade, but in every case they should cease work sufficiently early to attend evening classes in technical subjects. (i) That the continued employment of the apprentices should be subject to good behaviour and satisfactory progress; in cases of bad conduct or unsuitability the agreement could be mutually cancelled and a due proportion of the premium money, if any, be refunded. (j) To induce parents to apprentice their boys we are of opinion that the premiums should be kept as low as possible, and suggest that £10 should be regarded in most trades as a sufficient premium, and that even this sum should be waived wherever the employer will agree to do so. (k) We suggest that all such apprentices should be subject to inspection by the Education Authority's representative from time to time in working hours and that such Inspector shall satisty himself that the conditions of employment and training are being reasonably fulfilled 011 both sides ; the employer should report twice yearly as to the conduct, punctuality, and progress of each apprentice. (l) That such wages as should be agreed upon, and suitable to the trade chosen, should be paid weekly to the apprentices, graduated and increased each year as experience is gained; such weekly wages to be set out in a schedule as part of the apprenticeship agreement. (m) That for the purposes of this scheme the number of boys allowed to each shop or job by Trade Union rules be increased as may be mutually agreed. 61 95. Copies were forwarded to the Lord Mayor of London, the City Corporation, the London County Council, the Metropolitan Borough Councils, and the representatives of the Borough upon the County Council, with a request that they would support the views of the Council. Four of the Borough Councils expressed agreement with the views of the report, and a number were in favour of the principle of the scheme. The suggestions of the Council were also favourably received by the Master Decorators' Association and the London Institute of Builders, who adopted reports on the lines of the Council's scheme. A Committee of the County Council considered the resolutions, and stated in reply, that whilst fully sympathising with the object in view, the Committee regretted they were unable to make any recommendations to the County Council in the matter, as the Council had no legal power to pay apprenticeship premiums as suggested. Central Schools. 96. The Council approved generally of a scheme proposed by the London County Council for the establishment as part of the elementary school system of London of a series of Higher Schools, to be termed " Central Schools," which would give their pupils a definite bias towards some kind of industrial or commercial work, and would take the place of the existing higher elementary and higher grade schools. The curriculum of each school is to be determined with a view to meeting the needs of the district, the pupils between 11 and 12 years of age, being selected from surrounding schools. It is proposed to have a separate body of Managers for each Central School, consisting of eight persons appointed by the Borough Council and four by the County Council. Wandsworth Baths. 97.

The competition for the swimming trophy presented by Sir William Lancaster, J.P., and competed for annually by men resident in the Borough, was held on the 14th October, and was won by Mr. J Symons. Sir William Lancaster again gave a prize for the winner, as a memento of the occasion, and the Mayor (Alderman Dawnay) kindly provided a prize for the competitor who finished second. Women's Medal. 100. The competition for the medal for women residing in the Borough, presented by the late Mr. John Bell, J.P., was held on the 7th October, at the annual entertainment of the Wandsworth Swimming Club (Ladies' Section), and was again won by Miss N. Treversh. 63 Swimming Competitions for School Children. 101. Swimming competitions for school children were held at the Wandsworth Baths on the 14th October, and a free pass to the second-class bath, available during the following year, was awarded to the successful boy or girl from each school. The competitions are open to boys and girls from schools in the Borough attending the baths for instruction in swimming, the passes are available out of school hours and before seven o'clock in the evening. A large number of children and their parents were present, and the Mayor presided. There are 63 elementary schools in the Borough, 30 departments send pupils to the baths for instruction in swimming, and all entered for the competitions. The number of children taking part in the competitions was 138—68 boys and 70 girls. Storage of Cycles. 102. Several complaints having been received of cycles being stolen from the cycle room at the Wandsworth Baths, the Council decided to undertake the custody of cycles brought there by bathers, and to make a charge of one penny therefor. The receipts and the increased number of bathers who cycle to the baths show that the arrangement is fully appreciated by persons visiting the baths. Wandsworth Baths. 103. An improvement has been carried out at the Wandsworth Baths by covering in a small passage between the entrances to the first and second class swimming baths, which has proved a great convenience, especially when galas are held. A doorway has also been made between the first and second class baths, so that the second class bath can now be used for dressing purposes on these occasions. Swimming Baths. 104. An additional exit has been provided at the southern end of the gallery in the first class swimming bath; a doorway has been made and an iron staircase provided, which communicates direct with the embankment at the side of the building. Provision of Baths. 105. The Council being of opinion that additional swimming accommodation in covered buildings is required for the eastern side of the Borough, the question of providing such accommodation has been referred to a Committee, and is now under consideration. 64 Interments. 106.

An inscription will be cut in the stone, and a list of Huguenot families interred in the burial ground carved on the plinth. Laying Out Land for Burials Wandsworth Cemetery. 111. It has been found necessary to lay out additional land for burials at Wandsworth Cemetery, including a piece of the ground at present let for recreative purposes. New roads are being formed and the necessary drainage works executed. Stealing Flowers from Graves. 112. As the result of complaints of flowers being stolen from graves a watch was kept, and a man caught taking flowers from a grave at Wandsworth Cemetery.

General Report on Testings of Gas supplied to the Wandsworth Borough Council (1) by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company; (2) by the Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company for the year ended 31st March, 1911. Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company. I have made the usual bi-weekly tests of this gas during the year ended 31st March, 1911, as regards Illuminating Power, Sulphuretted Hydrogen, Sulphur (other than sulphuretted hydrogen) and Pressure. In Table I. will be seen a summary of the monthly averages of these tests, while in Table III. are shewn curves representing the fluctuations of the Illuminating Power and of the Sulphur based on the weekly averages of these tests. By reference to Table I. it will be noted that the average illuminating Illuminating Power for the year ended 31st March, 1911, is 14.6 candles, a somewhat lower average than has hitherto obtained. In January, 1911, the maximum monthly average of 15.0 candles was reached, while April, May, June and September, 1910, and February and March, 1911, shew the minimum monthly average of 14.5. Hence while the average is somewhat lower as a whole, there has been considerable uniformity in the Illuminating Power. By reference to Table III., shewing the curve based 011 the weekly averages of the Illuminating Power, it will be seen that these have varied between a minimum of 14.1 (November, 1910) and a maximum of 15.5 (January, 1911). 136 The average number of grains of Sulphur (other than sulphuretted hydrogen) in 100 cubic feet of gas was for the whole year ended 31st March, 1911, 277. This is a satisfactory average being rather less than that of 1909 (29.5 grains) although slightly higher than that of 1910 (24.0 grains). The monthly averages (Table I.) vary between a minimum of 24.0 (September, 1910) and 30.6 grains (February, 1911) while the weekly averages (see Sulphur curve, Table III.) shew a minimum of 207 (March, 1911) and a maximum of 34.8 grains (February, 1911). Sulphur. Pressure. The pressure has not been excessive at any time during the year ended 31st March, 1911. In Table I. it will be observed that with an average for the whole year of 2.8 inches, the minima and maxima monthly averages were 2.7 and 3.1 respectively. Sulphuretted Hydrogen. At no time have I found this impurity in the gas during the Past year. Proposed New Burner and Calorific Tests. In my last Annual Report, for the year ended 31st March, 1910, I called attention to the Gas Companies (Standard Burner) Bill, in which the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company and the Brentford Gas Company proposed to join, having presented a report on the same to the Council, dated 31st December, 1909. In that report I stated that there seemed to be no valid objection to the adoption of the proposed new Standard Burner (the Metropolitan Argand Burner No. 2) by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company. At the same time I strongly urged the institution of Calorific Power Tests, for information, with a view to the ultimate adoption of a Calorific Power Standard. Eventually, however, the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company withdrew from the Bill in March, 1910, and, to my regret, the matter dropped. Since that date the Brentford Gas Company having adopted a new Burner, very similar to but not identical with the Metropolitan Argand No. 2, successfully upheld in the High Court, in proceedings taken by the Chiswick Urban District Council, their right to use the same for the testing of their gas. 37 In January of this year (1911) the Engineer of the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company intimated to me that his Company considered they also had a right to use the new Brentford Burner for testing their Gas, and requested me to put the matter before the Wandsworth Borough Council. This I accordingly did and after consideration by the Council I finally reported on the whole matter at length on February nth, 1911, and made the following suggestions:— (1) That inasmuch as the new Brentford Burner so closely resembled the new Standard Burner (Metropolitan Argand No. 2) now in general use by the Metropolitan and other gas companies, and further since the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company had previously expressed a desire to adopt this latter Burner (having assisted originally in promoting the Standard Burner Bill above alluded to) I suggested that for the sake of uniformity they should adopt this Standard Burner instead of the new Brentford Burner. (2) That inasmuch as a change was proposed to be made in connection with the testing of the Illuminating Power of the gas, the occasion seemed a favourable one for instituting at the same time tests for the Calorific Power of the Gas. The Company agreed to use the Metropolitan Argand Burne No. 2 for testing the Gas and to provide the necessary apparatus for testing the Calorific Power. Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company. I have made the usual tests of Illuminating Power, Sulphuretted Hydrogen and Pressure of this Gas at the testing place in Haydon's Road, South Wimbledon, and my results are shewn in Table II. annexed to this report. It will be seen that the average Illuminating Power for the Illuminating whole year ended 31st March, 1911, is 15.8 candles power. with a minimum of 15.2 candles (December, 1910) and a maximum of 16.8 candles (November, 1910) the statutory Illuminating Power being 15 candles. 138 Pressure. The pressure which is usually rather higher than that of the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Co., has shewn an average of 3.6 inches with a minimum of 2.6 and a maximum of 4.3 inches. Sulphuretted Hydrogen. This impurity has been absent from the gas at all testings made during the year ended 31st March, 1911. H. Wilson Hake, Ph.D., Gas Examiner. TABLE 1.

REPORTS OF Libraries Sub-Committees. 192 REPORT OF THE CLAPHAM PUBLIC LIBRARY SUB-COMMITTEE, For the Year ended 31st March, 1911. The Sub-Committee have pleasure in presenting the TwentyFourth Annual Report on the work of the Clapham Library. The number of books issued during the year was 148,062 in the Lending Library and 22,718 in the Reference Library, being a total issue of 170,780 volumes, and a daily average of 727 volumes for the 235 days on which the library was open. These figures are the highest of any hitherto recorded, and show an increase in issues of 11,194 over the previous year, and a daily average increase of 62 volumes. The number of books now in stock is 19,122, of which 15,554 are in the Lending Library and 3,568 in the Reference Library. 4,419 readers' ordinary tickets (including renewals) and 1,359 students' tickets were issued during the year in the Lending Library. In consequence of all the available shelf room in the Reference Library being filled with books, three additional bookcases have been erected in that department, under the superintendence of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor. The Sub-Committee desire to express their cordial thanks to the donors of various books, periodicals, pictures, etc. The Borough Council in November, 1910, re-appointed the Mayor (Alderman Dawnay, J.P.), Alderman Lidiard, and Councillors Bulcraig, J.P., Cox, Cundall, Duncan, Henderson and 193 Young as the Sub-Committee for the Clapham Library for 1911 Councillor Cundall was re-elected chairman, with a vote of thanks for his services in the chair during the previous year. The Sub-Committee are again pleased to record their satisfaction with the efficient manner in which the Librarian and his Staff have discharged their duties. On behalf of the Sub-Committee, JAS. W. CUNDALL, Chairman. 1st May, 1911. 194 REPORT OF THE PUTNEY LIBRARY SUB-COMMITTEE, For the Year ended 31st March, 1911. The Sub-Committee have pleasure in presenting the TwentyThird Annual Report of the Library. In December, 1910, Councillors Gosden, Hoile, Jackson, Mathias and Radford were appointed by the Borough Council to act as Sub-Committee for the year 1911. Councillor Gosden was elected Chairman for the year. During the year a large sum of money was spent on the purchase of new books in order to make the new edition of the catalogue, to be issued early in the year 1911-12, as complete as possible. The Sub-Committee anticipate that the issue of the new catalogue will give an impetus to the issues of books from the lending department. The annual estimates for the year amounted to £1,279, the estimated product of a penny rate in the Putney Ward, plus a balance from the previous year of £121. The Sub-Committee desire to thank the donors of various books and newspapers to the library. After considering the hours of opening the library the SubCommittee resolved that on and after January 1, 1911 the reading rooms should remain open until 10 p.m. In order to give shop assistants the oportunity of using the lending department it was decided to keep that department open on Thursdays. ending Department. The stock in the Lending Department has increased by 1,724 volumes; of these 1,686 were acquired by purchase, and 38 were presented. One hundred obsolete volumes were withdrawn from stock, and 279 worn out books were replaced, making a total of 12,915 volumes now available for the use of borrowers. L+ 195 The issues have increased by 1,554 volumes, the total number being 75,643 as compared with 74,089 issued during the year 1909-10. On March 31st 2,225 borrowers' tickets and 300 students' tickets were available for use in the department. The sum of £55 1s 0d. was received from the sale of catalogues, fines, etc., during the year. Reference Department. The Reference Library is shelved in open cases, a plan greatly appreciated by readers. No record is kept of the number of books consulted, but it is estimated that upwards of 150 persons use the room daily. During the year 19 volumes have been added to the stock, making the total 2,42 volumes. Magazine Room. Thirty-five monthly magazines and reviews, six quarterlies and 52 weekly periodicals are placed in these rooms, which continue to be used by an increasing number of readers. The magazines and reviews are transferred to the Lending Department when replaced by new issues and are greatly in demand for home reading. News Room. The list of newspapers, etc., provided in this room includes 31 daily newspapers, among which are Birmingham, Cardiff, Dublin, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Manchester and Plymouth daily journals, 55 weekly newspapers and periodicals, and 62 monthly and quarterly publications. The only change in the staff was occasioned by the resignation of H. Rock, caretaker, whose position was filled by J. Roberts. A hearty vote of thanks was accorded to Councillor Mathias for his services as Chairman of the Sub-Committee during the year. The Sub-Committee again have much pleasure in recording their satisfaction with work of the Librarian and his Staff. Signed on behalf of the Putney Library Sub-Committee, ALFRED W. GOSDEN, Chairman. 196 REPORT OF THE STREATHAM, BALHAM, AND TOOTING LIBRARIES SUB-COMMITTEE, For the Year ended 31st March, 1911. In submitting the Twentieth Annual Report on the work of the Streatham, Balham, and Tooting Libraries the Sub-Committee have pleasure in again recording a considerable increase in the use made of the three libraries during the past year as indicated by the large number of books issued. The circulation at each library was as follows:— Institution. Lending Library. For Reference purposes. Total. Average Daily Issue. The Tate Library 190,154 11,103 201,257 821 Balham Library 166,483 4,166 170,649 697 Tooting Library 112,234 2,188 114,422 467 Total Number of Volumes issued 486,328 1,985 The total number of books circulated represents an increase of 31,321 on last year's return. A detailed statement of the number issued in each class of literature is given in the general table of statistics, page 15. It is a matter of much satisfaction to the Sub-Committee to find such convincing evidence of continued public appreciation of the usefulness and popularity of the libraries under their supervision. During the past twenty years the number of books issued 197 has increased from 120,744 to 486,328, and the growth of the stock from 6,017 volumes, with which the Tate Library opened, to 43,240 the present aggregate stock of the three libraries. The Sub-Committee are also gratified to observe how extensively the libraries are used by students and others for acquiring knowledge and information on the many and varied subjects of study occupying their attention. It may be interesting to mention as indicating the educative value of the libraries that last year there were issued for home-reading no fewer than 48,179 books in the classes of literature comprising history, biography, travel, science, art, ethics, poetry, sociology, etc. The issue of 11,103 volumes for consultative purposes at the Tate Library shows that in the populous district of Streatham a suitable Reference Reading Room is greatly needed. The number of Borrowers' Tickets issued at each library during the year was as follows:— Institution. No. of Tickets issued. Ordinary Tickets. Students' Tickets. Total. The Tate Library, Streatham 5,491 2,324 7,815 Balham Public Library 4,083 578 4,661 Tooting Public Library 2,824 1,144 3,968 Total 12,398 4,046 16,444 All tickets are renewable every year. The students' tickets, are not available for works of fiction or books in the Juvenile Department. The stock at the 31st March, after making the necessary deductions on account of replacements and discarded books, numbered 43,240 volumes, located as follows:— 198 Volumes in Stock. The Tate Library, Streatham 20,558 Balham Public Library 13,255 Tooting Public Library 9,427 Total 43,240 The classification of the stock is given in the table on page 16. The limited amount available for the maintenance of the three libraries makes it difficult for the Sub-Committee to provide copies of popular books in sufficient number to meet the increasing demand and also precludes the purchase at present of many important works of reference. Owing to the large circulation the sum required for the replenishment of worn-out stock is becoming every year a heavier charge on the book funds. At the annual stocktaking in July the number of books which could not be accounted for was four. The following is a statement of the receipts from fines, sale of catalogues, etc., at the three libraries:- £ s. d. The Tate Library, Streatham 143 15 0 Balham Public Library 94 9 2 Tooting Public Library 61 6 5 Total £299 10 7 At each library the work of cataloguing has occupied a good deal of attention. Revised editions of four catalogues of Fiction and Juvenile Literature (in the form of Indicator-Keys) and two Lists of Recent Additions were published at intervals during the year. The rapid growth of the Tooting Library also made it necessary to compile and print earlier than was anticipated a new General Subject-Catalogue of the books in the Lending Department. 199 During the ensuing year the Sub-Committee hope to proceed with the re-cataloguing of the books in the Tate Library. This work has now become a matter of urgency owing to the numerous and important additions that have been made to the collection in recent years and to the fact that several supplementary lists are now out of print. In the meantime, borrowers are reminded that some of these minor difficulties might be greatly mitigated if more frequent and careful use were made of the card catalogues, which, when used in conjunction with the printed catalogues, form a complete index to the contents of each library. The Reading Rooms continue to be used by a very large number of the inhabitants of the district, and are open every weekday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., and on Sundays (except during the months of July, August and September) from 3 to 9 p.m. The Rooms are supplied with a comprehensive selection of the principal newspapers and periodicals, a list of which is appended to this Report, pages 17 to 26. In response to their application the Sub-Committee have received from H.M. Stationery Office a grant of 105 volumes of historical publications. By the liberality of Sir William J. Lancaster, J.P., the staircase at the Tooting Public Library has been provided with white Pentelicon marble treads for the better preservation of the stone steps. In July, the Reading Rooms and Lending Department of the Tate Library were re-painted and decorated, and advantage was taken of the closing of the building to have part of the furniture re-polished. Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee, THOS. W. WATSON, Chairman. 29th May, 1911. 200 REPORT OF THE WANDSWORTH LIBRARIES SUB-COMMITTEE. For the Year ended 31st March, 1911. The Libraries Sub-Committee for the Parish of Wandsworth beg to report on the work of the Wandsworth Public Libraries for the 26th year of their existence. The Members of the Council which form the Sub-Committee are: Councillors Harrison (Chairman), The Mayor, Councillors Couzens, Everett, B.A., Evershed, Junr., J. A. Robinson, and Shillington. The Issues of books have increased from 162,300 to 180,587or an increase of over 11 per cent. The Libraries are now clear of debt, the last instalment of loans having been paid off during the year. Electric lamps with metallic filaments have been substituted at the Branches in Allfarthing Lane and Garratt Lane. The Libraries were closed on the day of His Late Majesty's Funeral, 20th May, 1910. The new edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica has been purchased and has proved of much service. The springs of the doors at Allfarthing Lane Branch Library have been repaired. 201 On page 15 will be seen a table of issues from each Library. During the year 3,064 borrowers' tickets and 650 students' tickets have been issued. The Sub-Committee are grateful for gifts of books, periodicals, etc. The sum of £102 6s. Id. had been paid into the bank, being receipts from fines, sale of catalogues, etc. There have been no changes in the staff during the year. A hearty vote of thanks was given to Councillor Couzens for his services in the chair during the past year. The Sub-Committee again desire to express their appreciation of the able and efficient way in which the Librarian and his Assistants have discharged their duties during the past year, also of the helpful assistance given by the Librarian to inquiring students and visitors generally.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1910. Population. The population of the Borough as estimated by the Registrar General was, in the middle of 1910, 305,838, an increase of 8,192 compared with 1909, but this estimate, in my opinion, is much under the actual population. The population on which all the rates in this Report are calculated has been obtained in a similar manner to that adopted since 1905, by dividing the number of inhabitants at the Cerisus, 1901, by the number of rated hereditaments in that year. The factor thus obtained represents the number of persons per rated hereditament, by which the number of hereditaments in the middle of 1910 is multiplied. 2 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. It is probable, however, that this calculation gives a population somewhat in excess of the actual population, as the number of persons per rated hereditament may have decreased. As the current year (1911) is a Census year the population will be fully corrected before the middle of the year. In the meantime, however, the method adopted, in my opinion, gives the closest approximation to the actual population. The population for the purposes of the Equalisation of Rates Act was estimated in 1906 as 296,020, in 1907, 308,663, in 1908, 318,603, in 1909, 327,322, and in 1910, 332,843, these populations being calculated from the number of rated houses. Table I. shows the population of each Ward and the number of rated hereditaments in 1901, the number of hereditaments in the middle of 1910, and the estimated population. TABLE I. Ward.

Compared with 1909, the greatest increase in population occurred in Streatham, next in Wandsworth, and the smallest in Putney. The corrected population in Table II. is used to calculate the urates in this Report. The difference between the corrected and uncorrected population is made up by the population in the Public Institutions of the Borough, which are as follows:— Clapham:—Hostel of God. Putney:—The Priory, Roehampton. Streatham:—St. Anne's Home. (St. Pancras parish.) Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). Jews' Home, Nightingale Lane. 4 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Tooting:—Tooting- Home. Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospital — The Fountain and the Grove. Newlands Asylum. Tooting Bee Asylum. Wandsworth:—The Workhouse. Royal Hospital for Incurables. Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). H.M. Prison. The total population of these Institutions was about 6,300, but as a proportion of the inmates of the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals belong to this Borough, a deduction of 5,900 made from the uncorrected total population gives, approximately, the corrected population, viz.:—343,800, compared with 339,100 in 1909,, 329,700 in 1908, and 320,120 in 1907. Births. During the 52 weeks ending the 31st December, 1910, 6,967 births, 3,570 of males and 3,397 of females, were registered, compared with 6,985 in 1909, 7,331 in 1908, 7,036 in 1907, and 7,057 in 1906. The total number of births registered in this Borough was. 6,873, but 166 births occurred in Institutions outside the Borough. of persons belonging to the Borough, and 72 births in Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging to the Borough, making a corrected total of 6,967. Of the 166 births which were registered outside the Borough, all occurred in Lying-in Institutions, 93 in Clapham Maternity, 43 in the General Lying-in Hospital, and 30 in various Institutions in other parts of London. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 5 In Table III. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rate of natural increase for each sub-district, and for the whole Borough.

The birth.rates for the year in all the sub.districts and in the Borough as a whole show a considerable reduction compared with the decennial average, while compared with the previous year there has been a slight reduction in all the sub.districts with the exception of Streatham, where there is a slight increase in this rate. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 7 The birth-rate for the whole of London was 23.85 per 1,000, compared with 24.3 in 1909, and 27.22 the decennial average; while for England and Wales this rate was 24.8 per 1,000, compared with 25.6 in 1909, and 27.47 the decennial average. With regard to this rate, although, as the Registrar General states in his Report for 1908, the crude birth-rate, i.e., the ratio of births to population at all ages, is valuable for comparing the rates from year to year, or for ascertaining the rate of natural increase, yet it is not of great value for any inquiry into the significance of the variations which occur over a period of years, on account of the changing constitution of the population, or for comparing the rate in different communities, on account of the differences in age and sex distribution. It is necessary therefore to calculate the proportion of births to the number of possible mothers, or the total number of females living in the Borough at ages 15 to 45 years. In the year 1901 this rate was 88.6 per 1,000, in 1907, 74, in 1908, 73, in 1909, 69.4, and in 1910, 68.2; while for England and Wales the rates were, in 1901, 114.2, and in 1909, 102.3. The legitimate birth-rate, calculatcd on the married female population was in 1901, 215 per 1,000, in 1908, 174, in 1909, 165, and in 1910, 164; while for England and Wales it was, in 1901, 234.2, and in 1909, 209.4. The low rates in this Borough are due to the greater proportion of females, both married and unmarried, at ages 15.45, compared with the whole of England and Wales, and also to the lower birth-rate. Although these rates are, owing to the lapse of time since the last Census, only approximately correct, yet there is no doubt that a very serious reduction has taken place in the birth-rate during the last 10 years. 170 births occurred in the Workhouse during the year and of these 10 belonged to Clapham, eight to Putney, 18 to Streatham, 11 to Tooting, 51 to Wandsworth, 64 to Battersea, and eight to other places. 8 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of these 170 births 106 were illegitimate, seven belonging to Clapham, four to Putney, 13 to Streatham, 10 to Tooting, 25 to Wandsworth, 41 to Battersea, and eight to other places. In the Borough, excluding the Workhouse, 128 illegitimate births occurred, 24 in Clapham, 11 in Putney, 42 in Streatham, 16 in Tooting, and 35 in Wandsworth. The total number of illegitimate births was 185, 31 of which belonged to Clapham, 15 to Putney, 55 to Streatham, 26 to Tooting, and 58 to Wandsworth, compared with 175 in 1909, and 177 in 1908. The percentage of illegitimate births to total births was 2.65, compared with 2.50 in 1909, 2.41 in 1908, 2.68 in 1907, and 3.5 for the whole of London for 1909. The following Table shows the percentage of illegitimate births to total births for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year, and for the three previous years. 1907 190 3 1909 1910 Clapham 2.7 2.45 3.58 2.46 Putney 2.8 3.42 3.41 3.05 Streatham 2.5 2.08 2.24 2.87 Tooting 3.2 2.88 2.65 2.60 Wandsworth 2.5 2.20 2.25 2.51 Whole Borough 2.68 2.41 2.50 2.65 Notification of Births Act. In October, 1909, the Local Government Board made an order declaring the above Act in force in the Borough from and after the 30th November, 1909. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 9 This has entailed a considerable amount of clerical work, as m addition to keeping a Register of the births notified, a copy has to be sent to the London County Council each week. So far as can be ascertained at present little advantage has resulted from the Act, as a very large proportion of the births are not notified, and many of these are cases which would benefit by a visit from the Council's Inspector. I am of opinion that if registration of the births were made compulsory within seven days much greater good would result, and the present duplicate system could then be abolished. The following Table shows the number of cases notified in each district and in the whole Borough, the person by whom notified, and whether the children were born alive or dead. TABLE V. Sub-district.

In the sub-districts these percentages were:—in Clapham 61.1 and 38.9; in Putney 50.0 and 50.0; in Streatham 55.1 and 44.9; in Tooting 61.2 and 38.8; and in Wandsworth 65.6 and 34.4. Deaths. During the 52 weeks ending the 31st December, 1910, 2,856. deaths, 1,401 of males and 1,455 females were registered, compared with 3,279 in 1909, 3,230 in 1908, and 3,337 in 1907. Compared with 1909 there has been a decrease of 423 deaths,, and of 1,058 compared with the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The uncorrected death-rate for the Borough was 8.16 per 1,000, compared with 9.50 in 1909, 9.63 in 1908, and 10.24 in 1907. The average uncorrected rate for the decennium 1900-1909 was 11.28, or 3.12 above the rate for the year 1910. 11 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the sub-districts these rates were as follows—7.31 in Clapham, 7.44 in Putney, 6.48 in Streatham, 18.79 in Tooting, and 7.35 in Wandsworth. The reason for the high rate in Tooting is that in that subdistrict there are a number of Public Institutions, as the Tooting Bee Asylum and the Tooting Home, where persons from other parts of London are received and among whom the mortality is very great. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in Out-lying Institutions of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, whose domiciles were in other parts of London. The total number of deaths for the 52 weeks, corrected for both internal and external Institutions was 3,105, compared with 3,520 in 1909, 3,380 in 1908, 3,416 in 1907, 3,461 in 1906, and 4,055 the decennial average corrected for increase of population. During the year 618 deaths occurred in Public Institutions and 105 in other places not institutions in the Borough. Of the total of 723 deaths, 564 were of persons not belonging and 159 of persons belonging to the Borough. Table VII. shows the total number of Institution deaths arranged according to sub-districts and Institutions in which they occurred, Table VIII. the deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough, and Table IX. of persons belonging thereto arranged according to causes of death, sex and age, and Institution in which the death occurred. 12 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In the Middlesex County Asylum the deaths were 12 less, in the Tooting Bee Asylum 41 less, in the Hostel of God 23 more, in the Tooting- Home 20 less, in the Fever Hospitals 30 less, in the Workhouse 38 less, in the Prison two more, in the Royal Hospital for Incurables two less, in St. Anne's Home 15 less, in The Priory seven less, and in other places 13 more, compared with the year 1909. In the Jews' Home, Nightingale Lane, six deaths occurred in 1909, and 13 in 1910. 13 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the deaths in other places not Public Institutions 20 occurred in Clapham, 28 in Putney, 35 in Streatham, ix in Tooting, and 11 in Wandsworth. Table VIII. shows the deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, arranged as to ages, causes of death, and Institution in which the death occurred. The greatest number of deaths was due to Old Age, and of the 138 registered, 111 occurred in Tooting Bee Asylum, 13 in the Tooting Home, six in the Workhouse, and four in the Middlesex County Asylum. In the Middlesex County Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Old Age, disease of the Respiratory Organs, Bright's disease, Enteritis, and all other causes, which include all diseases of the nervous, system. In Tooting Bec Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, Old Age, Softening of the Brain, Cancer, and all other causes; in the Hostel of God from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and Cancer; and in the Tooting Home from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Old Age, and all other causes. In the Fever Hospitals 10 deaths occurred from Scarlet Fever, compared with 18 in 1909, 15 from Diphtheria, compared with 28, two from Lobar Pneumonia, one from Measles, one from, Tubercular Meningitis, and one from Accident. 14 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In the next Table the number of deaths in Institutions outside the Borough is given in detail, but a complete list of these Institutions with the number of deaths that occurred in each during the year, is given after Table I. of the Local Government Board's Tables. As the Borough is dealt with as one Sanitary District the deaths of persons belonging to other parishes in the Borough in Institutions such as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting, are considered to be deaths in Internal Institutions with regard to the whole Borough, and are not included in the following Tables. The same applies to deaths in the Hostel of God, Clapham, the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, the Tooting Bee Asylum, and the Royal Hospitals for Incurables. 18 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The death-rate in England and Wales in 1910 was 13.4 per 1,000, compared with 14.5 in 1909, 14.7 in 1908, 15.0 in 1907, 15.4 in 1906, 16.2 in 1905, and 16.2 in 1904; in the 77 Great Towns 14.3, compared with 14.7 in 1909, and 14.9 in 1908; and in the 136 Smaller Towns 12.9, compared with 13.9 and 14.0. If a comparison is to be made with other places it is necessary to again correct the corrected rate, viz.:—9.03, for age andi sex distribution. This is done by multiplying the rate by a factor obtained bydividing the standard death-rate in England and Wales, at theCensus of 1901, with the standard death-rate for the Borough at the same period. This factor has been ascertained to be 1.0547, which gives a rate for this Borough for the year 1910 of 9.52 per 1,000, compared with 10.94 in 1909, 10.81 in 1908, 11.25 in 1907, 11.76 in 1906, 12.24 in 1905) 13.60 in 1904, 12.87 in 1903, and 14.00 in 1902. The following Table shows the standard death-rate, the factor for correction, the crude death-rate, the corrected death-rate, and the comparative mortality figure for London and for the 29 Boroughs, including the City of London, for the year 1910. The figures are extracted from the Quarterly Returns of the Registrar General for the year. 23 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XIII. AREA. Standard Death-rate. Factor for Correction.

In the separate sub-districts of the Borough the corrected death-rate was 8.15 in Streatham, 8.93 in Putney, 8.99 in Clapham, 9.61 in Wandsworth, 10.37 in Tooting. The rates in all the sub-districts were much lower than in 1909, and were by far the lowest ever recorded. The rates in this Table do not agree with the rates in Table XIV., as the rates in the later Table are calculated on the total population without deducting the population of non-parishioners in Public Institutions in the Borough. The first Chart shows the death-rate in the Borough for each fortnight, compared with the quinquennial average 1905-1909. The Chart shows that only on two fortnights was the rate above that for the previous quinquennium, viz.:— on the fortnights ending the 3rd and 17th December. During the rest of the year the fortnightly rate was under, and specially in March and September much under, the quinquennial rates. The highest rate, 13.07, occurred during the fortnight ending the 17th December, and this was due to the great number of deaths from Respiratory diseases owing to climatic conditions. The next Chart shows the Annual Death-rate per 1,000 during each week of the year for the whole of London and for each fortnight for the Borough of Wandsworth. During the whole year the rate in this Borough was under the rate for the whole of London. The highest rate in London was in the first week of December, and the lowest in the first week of August. The four Tables which follow are inserted by order of the Local Government Board. Table I. shows the births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate per 1,000 for the whole Borough for the year, and the 10 CHART Showing the Annual Death-rate during each fortnight of the year 1910, and the Quinquennial Average (1905 to 1909) for the Borough of Wandsworth.

In this Table column five gives the corrected number of deaths under one year, as the uncorrected number would not give the true rate of infantile mortality. Table II. shows the population, the number of births and deaths registered, and the number of deaths under one year of age, for the whole Borough, as well as for the various subdistricts.

Deaths from all causes at all ages, 378. 43 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Table XXIX. shows approximately the proportion of deaths per 1,000 births for each week under one month, and for each month up to 12 months from five groups of diseases. Compared with 1909 the rate from common infectiousdiseases is lower, due to the increase in the number of deaths from Measles and Whooping Cough. There has again been a very large reduction in the rate from Diarrhceal diseases, the rate having been only 10.90, compared with 13,15 in 1909, and 20.72 in 1908. From all other causes there has also been a slight decrease compared with 1909. Compared with the rate for England and Wales for 1909, the rate for the common infectious diseases was 6.97 per 1,000 in England and Wales and 5.30 in Wandsworth, from Diarrhœal diseases 12.64 in England and Wales and 10.90 in Wandsworth, from Wasting diseases 41.69 in England and Wales and 34.87 in Wandsworth, from Tuberculous diseases 4.00 in England and Wales and 2.00 in Wandsworth, and from other causes 43.43 in England and Wales and 25.11 in Wandsworth. The total rate per 1,000 births was 108 in England and Wales and in Wandsworth 86 for 1909, while the rate in Wandsworth for 1910 was only 78, by far the lowest rate ever recorded. Compared with the rate in England and Wales for the five years 1904-1908 the rate in this Borough was in 1910, from the common infectious diseases 2.85 lower, from Diarrhceal diseases 12.0 lower, from Wasting diseases 8.59 lower, from Tuberculous diseases 3.08 lower, from other causes 24.16 lower, and from all causes 50.87 per 1,000 births lower. In the Table it will also be seen that the rate from the common infectious diseases was highest at 10 to 11 months, from Diarrhoeal diseases at two to three months, from Wasting diseases under one month, from Tuberculous diseases at five to six and 11 to 12 months, and from other causes under one month. 44 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

From all causes the rate was, as in the previous year, highest under one week and lowest at 11 to 12 months. Table XXX. shows the infantile mortality per 1,000 births from all causes and from certain causes for the whole Borough and for each sub-district. From Premature Birth the rate was lowest in Putney and highest in Tooting, from Development diseases highest in Wandsworth and lowest in Clapham, from Diarrhoeal diseases highest in Tooting and lowest in Putney, from Measles and Whooping Cough highest in Wandsworth and lowest in Clapham, from Respiratory diseases highest in Tooting and lowest in Streatham, from Tubercular diseases highest in Putney and lowest in Clapham, and from other causes highest in Tooting and lowest in Clapham. The Table also shows the rates for certain groups of diseases compared with the five previous years. In all the groups there has been a reduction compared with the average, but it is greatest in the case of the Diarrhœa rate. In the sub-districts the greatest reduction in this rate has occurred in Tooting and the least in Streatham. It was noted in the Report for 1909 that the Infantile mortality rate was the lowest on record, but in 1910 there was a still further reduction, viz. :—from 86 to 78 per 1,000, and this reduction occurred in all the sub-districts. The climatic conditions were this year again unfavourable for Diarrhoea and digestive diseases of infants, while the deaths from diseases of the Respiratory Organs were also influenced by these conditions. In July, August and September, the temperature was above the average on only 15 days out of 92, and then only slightly above, while the number of days on which rain fell was in July and August much above the average. 46 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In September, although the rainfall was small, yet the temperature remained low, and as was the case in 1909, during these three months dust and flies were conspicuous by their absence. The work of the Inspectors, both male and female, has also largely contributed to the reduction of this mortality, the former in securing more cleanly and sanitary conditions of houses and yards, and the latter in the education of mothers as to the proper methods of infant feeding. The higher infantile mortality rates in Tooting and Wandsworth were not due to directly preventible causes as will also be seen from a perusal of the Table. The causes of these higher rates are Premature Birth with Developmental diseases, and Respiratory diseases, causes which are not so amenable to control by the Sanitary Authority. In Tooting the rate from Premature Birth was 21, from Developmental diseases 20, and from Respiratory diseases 23 per 1,000 births; in Wandsworth 14.33, 21.71 and 21.27; whereas in Putney the rate from Premature Birth was 10.18, from Developmental diseases 18.32; and in Streatham the rate from Respiratory diseases was 7.29 per 1,000 births. 47 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The following Table shows the percentage of deaths at different age periods to total infantile mortality for the year and for the five previous years. It will be noted that there has been an increase in this percentage under four weeks compared with the five years' average, due to the number of deaths from Wasting diseases. At the other age periods there has been a decrease compared with the five years' average, and this disease was greatest at nine to 12 months. TABLE XXXI. 1905. 1906. 1907. 1908. 1909.

Compared with 1909 there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Enteric Fever, Continued Fever and Whooping Cough, and a decrease in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Puerperal Fever, Erysipelas, Measles, Influenza, Diarrhœa, and other Septic diseases. e 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been an increase in the number of deaths from other Continued Fevers, but a decrease in all the other Zymotic diseases. From all Zymotic diseases the death-rate was .76 per 1,000 (.69 in Clapham, .81 in Putney, '62 in Streatham, .94 in Tooting, and .89 in Wandsworth), compared with 1.17 in 1909, 1,14 in 1908, 1.34 in 1907, 1.70 in 1906, 1.57 in 1905, 1.93 in 1904, and 1.66 the decennial average. The rate from the principal Zymotic diseases, viz.:—Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Diarrhoea, was .54 per 1,000 (.47 in Clapham, .53 in Putney, .40 in Streatham, .72 in Tooting, and .68 in Wandsworth), compared with .81 in 1909, .82 in 1908, .97 in 1907, 1.36 in 1906, 1.30 in 1905, and 1.60 in 1904. The rate in London was 1.14 per 1,000, compared with 1.30 in 1909, 1.37 in 1908, 1.37 in 1907, 1.94 in 1906, r68 in 1905, and 2.14 in 1904. The rate for England and Wales was '99, compared with 1.12 in 1909; in the 77 Great Towns 1.23, compared with 1.42 in the 136 Smaller Towns .88, compared with 1.08; and in Rural England and Wales .74, compared with '80. In out-lying Institutions 58 deaths occurred from Zymotic diseases (eight belonging to Clapham, three to Putney, 14 to Streatham, four to Tooting, and 29 to Wandsworth), compared with 96 in 1909, 54 in 1908, 48 in 1907, 52 in 1906, 67 in 1905, and 58 in 1904. Of these deaths 34 occurred in Workhouse Infirmaries, 13 from Measles, one from Influenza, 16 from Whooping Cough, two from Diarrhoea, and two from other Septic diseases; 13 in General and Special Hospitals, one from Whooping Cough, three from Diarrhoea, three from other Continued Fevers, one from Puerperal Fever, one from Erysipelas, and four from other Septic diseases; three in Public Lunatic Asylums, two from Measles and one from Diarrhoea; and eight in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, three from Scarlet Fever, one from Diphtheria, and four from Enteric Fever. 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Institutions in the Borough 29 deaths from Zymotic diseases occurred of persons not belonging thereto, compared with 57 in 1909, 82 in 1908, 106 in 1907, and 90 in 1906. The decrease in 1910 is due to the decrease in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. Of these deaths 26 occurred in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at Tooting, 10 from Scarlet Fever, and 15 from Diphtheria. One death from Measles occurred in the Grove Hospital, one death from Influenza in the Middlesex County Asylum, and one from Enteric Fever in H.M. Prison. In Institutions in the Borough 22 deaths from Zymotic diseases occurred of persons belonging thereto, 21 in the Fever Hospitals at Tooting, nine from Scarlet Fever, and 12 from Diphtheria. Compared with 1909, this shows a decrease of three deaths from Scarlet Fever, and of seven deaths from Diphtheria. The next Table shows the death-rates from these diseases for the whole Borough and for each sub-district for the year 1910, as well as for the preceding 10 years, and the rates above or below the decennial average are also shown. f 2 52 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The reduction, compared with 1909, was caused by the smaller number of notifications received from General Hospitals. 57 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In 1909 the total number of notifications received from outside Institutions was 130, in 1908, 170; in 1907, 55; and in 1906, 92. Vaccination. Table XXXVII. is taken from the official returns of the Vaccination Officers to the Board of Guardians for the year 1909. It shows the number of children successfully vaccinated for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts. Streatham, Balham and Tooting are included under the heading of Streatham.

This is a decided decrease compared with the five previous years. 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births registered in the Borough, and in the vaccination sub-districts for the year 1909, as well as for the 10 years 18991908. The average for the 10 years is also shown on this Table. Compared with 1908 there has been a decrease in the percentage of successfully vaccinated in all the sub-districts with the exception of Clapham. The greatest decrease occurred in Putney,. and the smallest in Wandsworth, while in the whole Borough there has been a decrease of .4 per cent. Compared with the decennial average there has been a decrease in all the sub-districts. The greatest decrease having been in Streatham, and the smallest in Putney. 413 infants died unvaccinated, a percentage of 5.9, compared with 67 in 1908, 6.6 in 1907, 8.1 in 1906, 8.4 in 1905, and 8.6 in 1904. Of the 2,313 infants remaining, 28 or .4 per cent, were stated to have been insusceptible to vaccination ; 753 or 10.8 per cent. in respect of whom certificates of conscientious objection were received; 461 or 6.6 per cent. had vaccination postponed by medical certificate, leaving 932 or 13.3 per cent, as removed, not to be traced, or otherwise unaccounted for; while 106 or 1.5 per cent. remained on the books as unvaccinated, compared with 13.6 per cent, as removed, etc., in 1908, 13.4 in 1907, 10.1 in 1906, and 7.7 in 1905; and 1.5 remaining as unvaccinated in 1908, 4.4 in 1907, 3.1 in 1906, and 3.1 in 1905. There has been a decrease of .3 in the percentages of cases removed, but an increase of 2.8 in the number of certificates of conscientious objections received. If the total number of infants who died unvaccinated be deducted from the total number of births registered, then of 6,559 the remaining infants, 64.7 per cent. were successfully vaccinated, compared with 65.7 in 1908, 71.2 in 1907, 78.1 in 1906, 81.5 in 1905, and 80.5 in 1904; .42 were insusceptible, compared with .37, .41, .23, .3 and .48; 7.0 percent, were under certificate of postponement, compared with 5.6, 4.8, 5.1, 4.2 and 3.4; 11.5 per cent. in 59 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. regard to whom certificates of conscientious objection had been obtained, compared with 8.6, 4.4, 2.8, 2.2 and 2.1; leaving 15.8 per cent. unaccounted for as regards vaccination, compared with 19.7, 19.1, 14.5, 11.8 and 13.1 TABLE XXXVIII, Sub-Districts. 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 Average for Ten Years. 1909 Clapham 57.7 62.5 62.8 63.7 68.2 62.9 68.8 59.9 55.1 51.9 61.3 55.1 Putney 72.0 71.0 75.7 84.4 86.5 83.4 88.1 86.7 83.6 85.0 81.6 80.4 Streatham 61.0 63.7 68.7 65.2 66.9 69.2 69.7 66.9 62.3 54.5 64.8 52.8 Wandsworth 76.0 74.0 78.6 82.3 81.7 82.8 80.9 78.7 74.5 69.1 77.8 68.9 Borough 68.1 67.8 71.4 72.4 73.7 73.5 74.6 71.05 66.5 61.3 70.0 60.9 The returns for the year 1909 again show a falling off as regards successful vaccination, and with the exception of the subdistrict of Putney, and to a less extent in Wandsworth, the record of the number of unvaccinated children in the Borough is by no means a satisfactory one. The percentage of children not finally accounted for, including cases postponed, to total births during the last 10 years was as follows for this Borough, for the Metropolis and for the rest of England. 1900 1901 I902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 Wandsworth 15.6 15.0 15 .7 15.9 15.3 14.6 18.0 22.4 23.4 21.5 Metropolis 25.8 24.1 21.3 20.7 19.1 18.9 21.2 22.7 ... ... Rest of England 13.9 11.2 10.0 9.1 8.7 8.6 9.5 10.4 ... ... The above Table shows that in Wandsworth this percentage is lower than it has been for the last two years, but if the cases 60 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. with respect to which conscientious objection certificates were received be included the percentage of unvaccinated children in the Borough would be 32.3, a very large increase compared with former years. Scarlet Fever. 687 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, compared with 987 in 1909, 1,232 in 1908, and 1,330 in 1907. 106 of these were in Clapham, 51 in Putney, 199 in Streatham, 100 in Tooting, and 231 in Wandsworth. 579 or 84 per cent, of these cases were removed to the hospital where 12 died, and 108 or 16 per cent, were treated at home with no death. The total number of deaths was 12, of which three were in Clapham, none in Putney, four in Streatham, two in Tooting, and three in Wandsworth. The percentage of cases removed to hospital, viz. : 84, is higher than in 1909, when it was 82 per cent. In 1908, 88.8 per cent. were removed; in 1907, 84.8; in 1906, 83.8; in 1905, 84.1; in 1904, 81.6; in 1903, 78.1; in 1902, 75; and in 1901, 70.6 per cent. The case mortality was 1.77 per cent. compared with 14.2 in 1909, 1.7 in 1908, 1.65 in 1907, 1.78 in 1906, 1.87 in 1905, and 1.74 in 1904. The mortality among cases removed to hospital was 1.6 per cent. compared with 1.6 in 1909, and among those treated at home no death occurred, compared with .57 in 1909. The mortality among the home-treated cases was thus much lower than among those cases treated in hospital. 61 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 2.0, compared with 2.88 in 1909, 3.67 in 1908, 4.08 in 1907, 3.4 in 1906, 5.1 in 1905, and 2.8 in 1904, and in the County of London 2.15, compared with 3.56, 4.60, 5.53, 4.3, 4.1, and 2.89. The proportion of cases notified was thus .15 per 1,000 lower in this Borough than for the whole of London, while in 1909 it was .68 per 1,000 lower. The following Table shows the rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year and the three previous years, as well as the corresponding rates for the whole of London.

In Clapham the greatest number of cases was notified in June, and the smallest in April, October and December. 62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There was a slight increase in the number of cases in Putney in 1910, compared with 1909, 51 cases having been notified, compared with 39. The greatest number was notified in September, viz.; eight, while no cases were notified in June. In Streatham the total number of cases was 161 less than in 1909. 1 he maximum number of cases was notified in February and the minimum in May, August and November. In Tooting, although the number of cases notified per 1,000 of population is still high, yet compared with previous years there has again been a marked reduction. In 1907, 318 cases were notified, 47 of these occurring in Institutions; in 1908, 218, 21 in Institutions; in 1909, 126, 38 of which were in Institutions; and in 1910, only 100, 19 of which were in Institutions. In this sub-district the rate of notified cases per 1,000 of population was 3.03, compared with 3.68 in 1909, and if the cases in Institutions are deducted, 2.49, compared with 2.74. The maximum number of cases in Tooting occurred in March, and the minimum in August. In Wandsworth there was also a reduction in the number of eases notified, the rate per 1,000 having fallen from 2.66 to 2.30, and it is also lower than the rates in 1907 and 1908. The maximum number of cases occurred in October, and the minimum in July. In the Borough the maximum number of cases was notified in March and October, and the minimum in May. The following Table shows the number of cases notified in each sub-district during each month of the year 1910, and for the whole year. 63 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XL.

Scarlet Fever and Schools. The next Table shows the number of cases of Scarlet Fever for each month of the year among children in attendance at elementary and other schools for each sub-district, also the number for the whole Borough, the number of cases among persons not at school, the number attending schools outside the Borough, as well as the number of cases in which, as far as could be ascertained, the diagnosis of Scarlet Fever was incorrect. Of the total number of cases, viz. :—687, the diagnosis was incorrect in 55 or 8 per cent.; 350 or 51 per cent, were in attendance at schools in the Borough; 21 or 3 per cent, attended schools outside the Borough ; while 261 or 37 per cent, did nol attend school, being either above or under school age. 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The percentage of children attending school was as follows : in Clapham, 57 out of 106, or 53 per cent, were at school; in Putney, 16 out of 51, or 31 per cent.; in Streatham, 113 out of 199, or 56 per cent.; in Tooting, 38 out of 81, or 47 per cent.; and in Wandsworth, 126 out of 231, or 54 per cent. The percentage in Tooting is calculated after deduction' of the cases notified from Institutions in that sub-district. In Clapham the schools chiefly affected were Cavendish Road, in which 11 cases occurred, and Haselrigge Road, with nine cases. Five of the cases in Cavendish Road occurred in June. In Putney only 16 cases occurred among children attending schools in that sub-district, but several of the cases in Putney attended schools in the Wandsworth sub-district. In Streatham the schools chiefly affected were Oldridge Road with 18 cases, and Welham Road, 11 cases. In Tooting, Sellincourt Road was chiefly affected with 16 cases, six of these occurring in June. In Wandsworth this disease was slightly more prevalent than in the other sub-districts, and the schools chiefly affected were Eltringham Street with 24 cases, Brandlehow Road with 19 cases, the Wandle with 14 cases, and Southfields with 10 cases. In Eltringham Street six cases occurred in November and five in December, and in Brandlehow Road seven of the cases occurred in October. In both schools there were missed cases which were the cause of infection, but only in Brandlehow Road was it necessary to take any action, one of the classrooms having to be closed so that thorough disinfection could be carried out. 65 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The Chart shows the number of cases notified in each week during the year. The greatest number, viz. :—28, was notified in the third week of February, and the smallest, six, in the third week of April. Of the total number of cases notified, viz. :—687, one or .14 per cent. was under one year, compared with eight or .81 per cent. in 1909; 174 or 25.3 per cent, were from one to five years, compared with 253 or 25.6 per cent.; 422 or 61.4 per cent. from five to 15 years, compared with 574 or 58.1 per cent.; 57 or 8.3 per cent. from 15 to 25 years, compared with 94 or 9.5 per cent.; and 33 or 4.8 per cent, from 25 to 65 years, compared with 38 or 5.9 per cent. Diphtheria. The number of cases of Diphtheria notified during the year again shows a satisfactory decrease compared with the previous year, and is also under the average number for the last 10 years.

CHART Showing the number of cases of DIPHTHERIA notified during each week of the year 1910. 71 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. All the sub-districts with the exception of Tooting, which is. the same, show a decrease compared with the previous year. The Chart shows the number of cases notified during eacb week of the year. The maximum number of cases, viz. :—13, was notified in the third and fourth weeks of October, and the minimum, viz. one, in the last week of March, the first week of April, and the fourth week of July. At no period of the year was there any outbreak to call for special notice, and this is due, as was stated in my Reports for previous years, largely to the methods adopted for dealing with cases in elementary schools.

In Clapham, out of a total of 49 cases, 21 or 45 per cent. occurred in children attending school; in Putney, of 16 cases, four or 25 per cent.; in Streatham, of 85 cases, 39 or 45.8 per cent.; in Tooting, of 63 cases, 30 or 47.6 per cent.; in Wandsworth, of 71 cases, 29 or 40.8 per cent.; and in the whole Borough, of 284 cases, 123 were in attendance at schools in the Borough, and 13 at schools outside the Borough, a total of 136, or 48 per cent. Of the remaining cases, viz. :—148, in 39 or 137 per cent., the diagnosis was incorrect, and 109 or 38 per cent. were not in. attendance at school. In Clapham the number of cases of Diphtheria in attendance at school was small. In six of the schools only one case occurred in each during the year, in four two cases, in one three cases, and in one four cases. In Putney also, only one case occurred in two schools, and two cases in one school. In eight months of the year in Putney no cases were notified among children attending school- In Streatham, Welham Road with nine cases and Eardley Road with seven were the highest. Five of the cases in the former school occurred in March, and five in the latter school in. September. The five cases in Eardley Road School all occurred in one classroom, and prompt measures were at once taken to prevent further extension of the disease, with the result that no further cases occurred in the school during the rest of the year. Of the five cases in Welham Road School in September, three were members of the same family. The sub-district of Tooting was also very free from Diphtheria for six months of the year, from April to September inclusive, no cases occurred. Ensham Street and Franciscan Road Schools had nine cases each, but in neither school was any particular classroom involved. In Wandsworth there were only 29 cases and these occurred at irregular intervals during the year. In six of the schools only one case occurred in each, in three two cases, in two three cases in each, in one four cases, and seven cases occurred in the various private schools. 75 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the total number of cases notified 39 were incorrectly diagnosed, compared with 45 in 1909, leaving a total of 245, compared with 335 in 1909, and 527 in 1908. No cases of Diphtheria were notified as having occurred in. children attending the following elementary schools in the: Borough :— In Clapham :— Clapham Parochial. Macaulay Road. New Park Road.

In six of the cases complaint was made that the patients suffered from nasal discharge. Enteric Fever. 54 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year (six from Clapham, four from Putney, 13 from Streatham, five from Tooting, and 26 from Wandsworth), compared with 66 in 1909, 60 in 1908, 70 in 1907, 96 in 1906, and 96 in 1905. 37 of the cases were removed to hospital where four died, and 17 were treated at home with four deaths. The total number of deaths was eight (one in Clapham, one in Putney, two in Streatham, none in Tooting, and four in Wandsworth), compared with six in 1909, seven in 1908, 10 in 1907, 15 in 1906, 11 in 1905, and 11 in 1904. The number of deaths was two more than in 1909, but 8.9 under the decennial average. 80 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 15, compared with .19 in 1909, .18 in 1908, .21 in 1907, .30 in 1906, and "33 in 1905, and with "26 for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from Fever was .02 per 1,000, compared with .017 in 1909, .02 in 1908, .03 in 1907, '048 in 1906, .04 in 1905, and .04 in 1904, while the rate for the whole of London was .04, compared with .03 in 1909, .04 in 1908, .04 in 1907, .05 in 1906, .05 in 1905, and .06 in 1904. Of the 37 cases removed to hospital, 11 or 29 per cent. were found not to be suffering from Enteric Fever, compared with 32 per cent. in 1909. The Chart shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. In 18 of the weeks during the year no cases were notified, one case each in 19 of the weeks, two cases each in 12 of the weeks, three cases each in two of the weeks, and four cases in one of the weeks. The maximum number of cases, viz.:—Four, was notified in the first week of November. Of the 54 cases notified 11 were not Enteric Fever, leaving 43 cases in which special enquiries were made as to the probable cause of the disease. In 14 of the cases the disease was probably contracted by eating shell-fish, in six it was contracted outside the Borough (one in Algiers, one in Margate, one in Boulogne, one in New York, and two in other places), in nine the infection was contracted from other cases, in four probably from watercress, four occurred in the Prison, while in six no history of infection could be ascertained. With regard to the 14 cases caused by shell-fish, five were from oysters, five from mussels, and four from winkles. In the cases contracted outside the Borough, six in number, it was impossible to ascertain the exact source of infection, but in three of the cases it was probably from infected water supply. 81 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the nine cases contracted from other cases, one was infected by a "carrier" case, and another in a neighbouring Borough was also infected by the same "carrier." The history of the "carrier" case was quite definite, and examination of the stools and urine bacteriologicallv showed that in the former numerous typhoid bacilli were present. The second, third and fourth examinations of the stools and urine, however, gave negative results. The "carrier" case contracted Enteric Fever in 1906 and was ill in all for about ten weeks. On the 26th January, of this year, he had an indefinite illness with severe abdominal pain and fever, and recovered in about 14 days. On the 26th February his nurse, who resided in a neighbouring Borough, was found to be suffering from Enteric Fever, and was removed to the Fever Hospital on the 9th March, where she died on the 15th March. The son, who resided in this Borough, was notified on the 16th March and removed to hospital, from which he was discharged on the 3rd June. A second case infected by a previous case was that of a medical student who had been in attendance on several cases in hospital. A third case was that of a girl in an Institution infected by a previous case which was not resident in the Institution, but resided in a neighbouring Borough. The six remaining cases infected by other cases had an interesting history, and the following special report was made on the matter, on the 10th November, to the Public Health Committee:— "10th November, 1910. "Enteric Fever in Wandsworth. "I have to report the occurrence of several cases of Enteric Fever in Wandsworth, due chiefly to a mild case which was not at first diagnosed as Enteric Fever. G 82 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "The particulars of the case are as follows:—On the19th September, a case of Enteric Fever was notified to me in the person of R. B., aged10 years, residing in Burtop Road, the first symptoms having occurred about the 7th September. At the time careful inquiries were made, but the source of infection could not be ascertained. After his return from hospital on the 8th November it was ascertained that this boy had had winkles, bought from a street vendor, on the 21 st August, and also about the same time had eaten what he called watercress which he had taken from the River Wandle,, near McMurray's Mills. "No further cases were notified until the 27th October,, when I received a certificate to the effect that J. J., aged four years, residing in Burtop Road, opposite the first case, was suffering from the disease, the first symptoms having occurred about the 16th October. It was not at first suspected that there had been any connection between this case and the first one. On the 3rd November, however, three cases, sisters of J. J., aged respectively six, eight, and nine years, were notified, the first symptoms occurring in each of those three about the 23rd September, and I then visited Burtop Road and ascertained that the only other child in the house, S. J., aged one-and-three-quarters years, had had a suspicious illness attended by sickness of diarrhoea, about the 1st October, and also that this infant had been sent to another house in Burtop Road to a nurse who was attending R. B., the first case, previous to his removal to hospital, and before the nature of the illness was suspected. At the same time I was informed that a girl, F. C., aged 22 years, who had been nursing the second case, J. J., was ill and feverish, and with the consent of the medical attendant I visited and found her to be suffering from a typical attack of Enteric Fever. "My attention was then directed to the boy of one-andthree-quarters years, and as I suspected that he had teen infected by R. B., and thus in turn infected the five other cases, and also as I had been informed that the nurse had taken the child to the house in Burtop Road where the first case occurred, I had a specimen of his blood taken for examination. The result of this examination was positive, a VVidal re-action having been obtained. To make the 83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. nosis more certain, samples of the faeces and urine have been taken, and these are now under examination at the Lister Institute. I am, however, of opinion that this infant is convalescent from Enteric Fever, and that the first symptoms occurred about the end of September, a fortnight after it had been exposed to infection. R. B. was ill for nine days before his removal to hospital, and was being nursed by the same person who had charge of the infant without any precautions being taken. The nurse states that she prepared food both for the boy R. B. and for the boy J. J., and it is easy to understand how the infection could have been communicated. "The necessary disinfection has been carried out by the staff. "The infant is being treated at home under the supervision of the medical attendant, and I do not expect that any further cases will occur." The stools and urine of the infant S. J. were examined on two separate occasions, but on both a negative result was obtained. A Widal re-action was, however, obtained on a second examination. One of these cases, the nurse, aged 22 years, died in hospital. Another case occurred in the same street a few weeks after, and it was at first thought that this last case was also infected by S. J., but further inquiries showed that the patient had partaken of shell-fish purchased from the same vendor that supplied R. B. This last case was not notified for seven weeks after the first symptoms appeared, and died the same day that the notification was received. Of the total number of cases, viz.: 14, in which infection was probably caused by eating shell-fish, six died, and other six cases, one of which died, were infected by one of the cases caused by shell-fish. g 2 84 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Although a considerable amount of supervision is now carried out, and a large amount of useful work done by the Fishmongers' Company in preventing polluted shell-fish from being sold, yet without more stringent legislation on the matter it will be impossible to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. In only six of the cases which proved to be Enteric Fever •could no history of infection be ascertained, and one of these proved fatal. Of the ii cases which proved to be not Enteric Fever four proved fatal, one from Otitis, one from Empyema, one from Pneumonia, and one from Peritonitis. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. In 107 cases (55 of Scarlet Fever, 39 of Diphtheria, and 11 of Enteric Fever), information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's and other hospitals, that the patients were not suffering from the disease notified or any other notifiable •disease, compared with 112 in 1909, 110 in 1908, 111 in 1907, 93 in 1906, 97 in 1905, and 94 in 1904. Of the 845 cases removed to hospital, in 107 or 12.6 per cent. the diagnosis was incorrect, compared with 9.5 per cent. in 1909, 6.9 per cent. in 1908, 6.5 in 1907, 6.7 in 1906, and 5.2 in 1905. There has been a marked increase in the percentage of incorrect diagnosis compared with previous years. 85 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XLVII. Disease.

Cerebro-spinal Fever. Five cases of Cerebro-spinal Fever were notified during the year (one from Clapham, one from Tooting, and three from Wandsworth), compared with four in 1909. All the cases died, two from Cerebro-spinal Meningitis, one from Posterior-basic Meningitis, and two from Tubercular Meningitis. In London 115 cases of this disease were notified during the year, compared with 111 in 1909. 19 deaths were registered as having been caused by Meningitis (two in Clapham, two in Putney, five in Streatham, three in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth). 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Five of these were of infants under one year, four from one to five years, and 10 over five years. As in previous years, inquiries were made from the medical attendant, and in all the cases, with the exception of two, due to Posterior-basic Meningitis, the disease was stated to have been Simple Meningitis. Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 318 bacteriological examinations were made at the Lister Institute, compared with 397 in 1909, 491 in 1908, 466 in 1907, 407 in 1906, 174 in 1905, 121 in 1904, 125 in 1903, 98 in 1902, and 66 in 1901.

Puerperal Fever. 20 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, compared with 26 in 1909, 14 in 1908, 25 in 1907, 25 in 1906, 18 in 1905, and 14 in 1904. One case occurred in Clapham, one in Putney, four in Streatham, five in Tooting, and nine in Wandsworth. Five of the cases (one in Putney, one in Streatham, two in Tooting, and one in Wandsworth), or 25 per cent. were fatal, compared with 38.4 per cent. in 1909, 42 in 1908, 40 in 1907, 44 in 1906, and 44.4 in 1905. Eight of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary, but none died, and two were treated in General Hospitals with one death. The death-rate was '014 per 1,000, compared with 029 in 1909, .018 in 1908, .031 in 1907, and .035 in 1906. The case-rate per 1,000 births was 2"8, compared with 3*7 in 1909, and for the whole of London 2.5, compared with 2.4. In three of the cases midwives only were employed, while three cases were premature, two were miscarriages, and in three the children were stillborn. Five nurses had free baths, and of the others, two came from Battersea, two from Lambeth, one from Fulham, three were district or surgical nurses, and the remainder had baths at their own homes. In 16 cases the personal clothing of the nurse was disinfected. 88 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Erysipelas. 182 cases of Erysipelas were notified during the year and four deaths occurred. 32 of the cases and one of the deaths occurred in Clapham, eight cases and one death in Putney, 40 cases and one death in Streatham, 31 cases and no death in Tooting, and 71 cases and one death in Wandsworth. In 1909 the number of cases notified was 192, and the deaths eight. 35 of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary, but none of these cases were fatal. Measles. During the year 44 deaths, 28 of males and 16 of females, were due to Measles, compared with 108 in 1909, 45 in 1908, 66 in 1907, 65 in 1906, 89 in 1905, and 104 in 1904. 12 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, five in Putney, eight in Streatham, four in Tooting, and 15 in Wandsworth. The number of deaths is 64 less than in 1909, and 57.5 below the corrected decennial average. Seven of the deaths were of infants under one year, 34 from; one to five years, and three from five to 15 years; 93.2 per centof the deaths having occurred under five years of age. The death-rate was .13 per 1,000, compared with .31 in 1909,. .14 in 1908, .21 in 1907, .21 in 1906, and .31 in 1905. The death-rate for the whole of London was .40, compared' with .48 in 1909, for England and Wales .23, and for the 77 Great Towns .31 per 1,000. 89 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the year 957 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in cases of Measles, 260 in Clapham, 245 in Putney, 164 in Streatham, 174 in Tooting, and 114 in Wandsworth. The next Table shows the number of premises disinfected after Measles in each sub-district for each month of the year. The total number of premises disinfected was 418 (146 in Clapham, 108 in Putney, 53 in Streatham, 43 in Tooting, and 68 in Wandsworth), compared with 1,012 in 1909, 884 in 1908, 955 in 1907, 902 in 1906, 798 in 1905, and 1,115 in 1904. The greatest number of disinfections was carried out in December, this being due to outbreaks in Clapham and Putney. The greatest number of cases occurred in June, July, November and December. In March, August and September the number of disinfections was small as there were very few cases in any part of the Borough. TABLE XLIX. Month. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth.

In all, 4,617 cases were notified, compared with 4,342 in 1909. 3.753 in 1908, and 4,079 in 1907. 90 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 904 of these were cases of Measles, 1,010 of Chicken-pox, 919 of Whooping Cough, 1,274 of Mumps, and 510 of Ringworm. There was an increase in the number of cases of Chicken-pox, Whooping Cough and Mumps, and a decrease in the number of cases of Measles and Ringworm. With regard to Measles, 253 were notified from schools in Clapham, 225 in Putney, 202 in Streatham, 130 in Tooting, and 94 in Wandsworth. The schools chiefly affected were : in Clapham, Haselrigge Road and St. Andrew's Street; in Putney, Hotham Road, St. Mary's and All Saints; in Streatham, Oldridge Road, Broadwater Road and Fircroft Road; in Tooting, Tooting Graveney; and in Wandsworth, Earlsfield Schools. There was no widespread epidemic of this disease either in 1909 or 1910, but in the current year it is already, at the beginning of the year, epidemic, and the number of cases and deaths will be much greater compared with the two previous years. The following pamphlet is now left at every house where a case of Measles has been notified from school, and also in all other known cases:— "PRECAUTIONS AGAINST MEASLES. "1.—Measles is a dangerous infectious disease and is very fatal to young children. In the five years 1905-1909 the total number of deaths from Measles in London was 9,260, or more than four times greater than the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever. "2.—It is very highly infectious, especially in the early stage before the rash appears. "The first symptoms of the disease are coughing, sneezing, and redness of the eyes. "3.—A child suffering from Measles must not be sent to school until four weeks after the appearance of the rash. 91 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "4.—A child suffering from Measles should, if possible, be placed in a separate room, with a good fire burning in it, and the window should be opened so as to admit some fresh air without allowing the room to become cold. The bed should be placed in the part of the room where there is least draught. The fire should be lighted even in summer so as to get some ventilation. "Where a separate bedroom cannot be got, the above instructions should still be carried out. "5.—As the death-rate from Measles is high, parents are advised in every case to call in a doctor at once. "6.—All the other children in the house who have not had Measles before, must be kept away from school, but the other children living in the house who have had Measles may continue at school. "The same applies to the attendance of children at any public meeting such as Church, Sunday-school, or Children's Treat. "It is important to remember that children rarely take true Measles more than once in their lives. "7.—When a case of Measles has occurred in a house, the other children should be carefully watched, so that on the first appearance of illness they may be kept at home and properly treated. "8.—When a child in any house is suffering from Measles, no neighbour's or friend's children must be admitted to the house. The child who is suffering from Measles must not be allowed to play with other children for one month after the appearance of the rash. "9.—Disinfection. When a child has recovered, notice should be at once sent to the Medical Officer of Health, who will have proper disinfection carried out. After disinfection it is necessary for the clothing of the patient, as well as the bed linen and blankets, to be washed and aired. The room 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. should be scrubbed out and all washable articles of furniture should be washed. The windows of the room should be left open for one or two days, and as much sunlight as possible admitted. "The skin of the child who has been ill should be thoroughly cleansed by several washings with soap and warm water. "P. Caldwell Smith, M.A., M.D., D.P.H., Camb., "Medical Officer of Health.

Whooping Cough. 68 deaths were registered during the year, 37 of males and 31 of females, an increase of one compared with 1909, but a decrease of 13 compared with the decennial average. Nine of the deaths occurred in Clapham, eight in Putney, 16 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 26 in Wandsworth. 30 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 37 of children from one to five years, and one from five to 15 years. The death-rate was .20 per 1,000, compared with .19 in 1909, and '27 for the whole of London in 1910. This disease was slightly more fatal in London and in this Borough in the year 1910 than in the two previous years. In the sub-districts of Clapham, Streatham and Wandsworth it was. slightly more prevalent than in the other two sub-districts. The number of cases notified from schools was 919, compared with 538 in 1909, 612 in 1908, 255 of these being from schools in the sub-district of Wandsworth, the schools chiefly affected in that sub-district being Southfield and Swaffield Road, and Streatham, where the schools chiefly affected were Oldridge Road and Mitcham Lane. There were also 201 cases notified from schools in Clapham the schools chiefly affected having been Telferscot Road and Cavendish Road. In Putney the school chiefly affected was Hotham Road, and in Tooting, Franciscan Road and Fountain Road. The greatest mortality from Measles and Whooping Cough occurs among children under five years of age. Of the 112 deaths that occurred from these diseases, 108 or 96.4 per cent. were deaths of children under five years. 96 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following pamphlet is now left at every house where a case of Whooping Cough has been notified from school, and also in all other known cases. During the year 49 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in cases of Whooping Cough, six in Clapham, 29 in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 12 in Wandsworth. The small number of cases visited is explained by the fact that it was only during the last six weeks of the year that these cases were systematically visited. "PRECAUTIONS AGAINST WHOOPING COUGH. "1.—Whooping Cough is a very fatal infectious disease. In the five years 1905-1909 the total number of deaths from Whooping Cough in London was 6,230, or nearly three times greater than the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever. "2.—It is very infectious, even before the well known crowing sound shows itself. "3.—When a child has Whooping Cough no other child or neighbour accompanied by a child must be admitted to the house, nor should the child who is ill be allowed to return to school or play with other children for 14 days after the <'whoops" have stopped altogether. "4.—A child suffering from Whooping Cough should if possible be kept in one room, with a fire burning in it and the window slightly open to admit fresh air. "5.—When one child has been attacked, the other children in the house who have not had the disease should be watched, and any illness accompanied by coughing should be regarded as probably Whooping Cough. "6.—All the other children in the house who have not bad Whooping Cough before must be kept away from school, but the other children living in the house who have had Whooping Cough may continue at school. "The same applies to the attendance of children at any public meeting such as Church, Sunday-school, or Children's Treat. 97 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "It is important to remember that children rarely take Whooping Cough more than once in their lives. "7.—The matter coughed or spat up by the patient should be received into a piece of clean paper or rag, and should at once be burned. All discharges from the nostrils should be treated in the same way. "8.—In all cases of Whooping Cough a doctor should be called in at once. "9.—When the cough has gone the rooms should be thoroughly cleansed. All the bed ticks, blankets and sheets, as well as all clothing which has been worn by the patient should be washed and well aired, in sunshine if possible. "P. Caldwell Smith, M.A., M.D., D.P.H., Camb., "Medical Officer of Health. "Public Health Department, "90, East Hill, Wandsworth, S.W. "July, 1910." Other Diseases Notified from Schools. In addition to the 904 cases of Measles and 919 of Whooping Cough notified by the teachers of elementary schools, there were also notified 1,010 cases of Chicken-pox, 1,274 of Mumps, and 510. of Ringworm. No action is at present taken by the Sanitary Authority after notification of these diseases, although during the prevalence of Small-pox cases of Chicken-pox were visited. Chicken-pox was most prevalent in Streatham and Wandsworth, Mumps in Clapham and Wandsworth, and Ringworm in Clapham and Wandsworth. H 98 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Closure and Disinfection of Schools. During the year the following schools were closed and disinfected or disinfected only, on account of the prevalence of Measles or Scarlet Fever. (1.)

There has thus been a decrease of 34 deaths compared with the previous year, and of 28'8 compared with the corrected decennial average. 11 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, seven in Putney, 18 in Streatham, four in Tooting, and 15 in Wandsworth. The death-rate was .16 per 1,000, compared with .26 in 1909, .25 in 1908, .27 in 1907, and .22 in 1906. 25 of the deaths were of persons from 25 to 65 years, and 21 of persons over 65 years. Diarrhoea. 35 deaths, 22 of males and 13 of females, occurred from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis during the year, compared with 52 in 1909, 101 in 1908, 65 in 1907, 218 in 1906, 137 in 1905, and 208 in 1904. There has thus been a decrease of 17 in the number of deaths from these diseases compared with the previous year, and of 115, compared with the corrected decennial average. Three of the deaths occurred in Clapham, three in Putney, eight in Streatham, four in Tooting, and 17 in Wandsworth. In Clapham, Tooting and Wandsworth there was a decrease compared with 1909, and in Putney and Streatham a slight increase. 102 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Clapham the number decreased from 10 to three, in Tooting from 14 to four, and in Wandsworth from 19 to 17, while in Putney the number increased from two to three, and in Streatham from seven to eight. The death-rate was .10 per 1,000, compared with .15 in 1909, .30 in 1908, .20 in 1907, and .70 in 1906. The death-rate for the whole of London also shows a decrease, it being .28, compared with .32 in 1909, but in the three previous years the rates were: .53 in 1908, .33 in 1907, and .95 in 1906. The death-rate in the sub-districts was as follows:—In Clapham .04, compared with .14 in 1909; in Putney 09, compared with .06; in Streatham .07, compared with '06; in Tooting 12, compared with .43; and in Wandsworth .17, compared with .19. Of the total number of deaths registered, 29 or 83 per cent. were of infants under one year, compared with 80 per cent. in 1909, 73 per cent. in 1908, 83 per cent. in 1907, 86 per cent. in 1906, and 87 per cent. in 1905. Including Enteritis, the total number of deaths was 88, compared with 124 in 1909, 183 in 1908, 127 in 1907, 289 in 1906, 203 in 1905, and 301 in 1904. Of these 88 deaths, 66 or 75 per cent. were of infants under one year. The following Table shows the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis under one year for the four quarters of 1910, and for the five previous years. 103 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LII 1905. 1906 1907. 1908. 1909. 1910.

The proportion of deaths in this quarter to total deaths from Diarrhoea is smaller than in any of the five previous years. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, Zymotic Enteritis, and Enteritis under one year represents 12 per cent. of the total mortality at that age, compared with 15 per cent. in 1909, 19 per cent. in 1908, 13.8 per cent. in 1907, 33 per cent. in 1906, 211 per cent. in 1905, and 28.8 per cent. in 1904, so that the diminution of the mortality under one year was, as in the two previous years, largely due to the decrease in the number of deaths of infants from the above causes. In all the deaths under one year from Diarrhœal diseases, special enquiries were made, and the following Table shows the nature of the food given. 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In 29, or 50 per cent., cows' milk, either alone or with condensed milk or farinaceous food, was given; while in 10, or 17.2 per cent., condensed milk only, or condensed milk and farinaceous food was given. In eight cases no information could be obtained, one in Clapham, two in Putney, one in Streatham, one in Tooting, and three in Wandsworth. In many of the cases the enquiries of the Inspectors showed that the children had been suffering from other diseases, had been delicate from birth, or had been born prematurely. 105 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 66 deaths, 23 occurred in Institutions outside the Borough. In 15 of the cases the mothers had to go out to work, 10 being laundresses, three charwomen, and two daily servants. The next Table shows the result of the enquiries made after these deaths, arranged in Wards, and there is also shown the number of infants who had been previously visited, the number of illegitimate infants, and the social status of the parents. It may also be seen in the Table that 12 of the infants who died from Diarrhoea had been fed in accordance with the pamphlet left by the Inspectors, and also that of the total number of deaths respecting which enquiries were made, viz.:—58, eight were prematurely born, and 15 were delicate from birth. Of the 12 stated to have been fed in accordance with the instructions on the pamphlet, four were prematurely born, four were delicate from birth, one was illegitimate, and one suffered from Disease of the Brain. During the year the female Sanitary Inspectors have continued the work begun in 1905, in visiting the homes where births had occurred, and they have also had during the year, as is stated in their report, valuable assistance from several voluntary health visitors. 106 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

"We have the honour of submitting to you a report of our work among infants during the year 1910. "We had the help of seven voluntary workers at different times throughout the year—five for periods of three months each, viz.: March 1st to May 31st, March 9th to June 2nd, June 2nd to August 18th, June 8th to August 30th, and October 3rd to December 30th; one from September 14th to October 20th, and one from November 17th to December 22nd. With this additional help we were enabled to extend our work to every part of the Borough, as will be seen from the subjoined Tables. Out of the total number of visits, viz. : 6,874 (which included re-visits and ineffectual calls), 3,504 were paid by the voluntary workers (Clapham, North, 247; Clapham, South, 147; Putney 74, Streatham 281, Balham 246, Tooting 556, Southfield 467, Fairfield 170, Springfield 555, and 761 ineffectual visits). "The total number of visits paid after notification and registration of births will be found in Table LIV., which also shows the method of feeding at the first visit, and the number of ineffectual calls. "With regard to the Notification of Births Act, which came into force in this Borough in November, 1909, we have found considerable difference in the number of births notified in the various Wards. For instance, nearly every birth among the poorer classes in the Springfield Ward of Wandsworth was notified; consequently we were able to visit those infants at an earlier date than those in other parts. Bearing this in mind, we should like to draw your attention to the number of deaths in that Ward during the year, which you will see is higher than that of any other part of the Borough. The analysis of the causes of death we give below. "79 of the infants visited died during the year, their age in months at death being shown in Table LVI. In Clapham, North, five deaths occurred—two from Broncho-pneumonia, 108 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. one from Tubercular Meningitis, and two from Enteritis. In Clapham, South, one died from Convulsions, one (illegitimate) from Congestion of the Lungs, and one from Enteritis. In Putney, one (illegitimate) died from Acute Catarrh of Lungs, and one from Muco-Enteritis. In Streatham, seven died—two from Diarrhoea, and the others from Pneumonia, Whooping Cough, Tubercular Meningitis, Inanition and Prematurity, and Convulsions respectively. In Balham, eight died—three from Broncho-pneumonia, three from Diarrhoea, Gastritis and Enteritis, one from Marasmus, and one from Prematurity. In Tooting, nine died—four from Broncho-pneumonia (one being illegitimate), two from Enteritis (one illegitimate), one from Marasmus, one from Atrophy, and one from Tubercular Meningitis. In Southfield, 10 died—two from Enteritis, three (one illegitimate) from Diarrhoea, two from Bronchitis, one from Whooping Cough, and one from Prematurity and Inanition. In Fairfield, 10 died—five from Bronchitis, and the others from Prematurity and Inanition (a twin birth), Congenital Syphilis, Whooping Cough, Heart Failure, and Pyloric Stenosis respectively. In Springfield there were 26 deaths, mainly from Bronchitis and Pneumonia, 15 being due to that cause, one from Whooping Cough, one from Tuberculosis, the mother dying of Consumption within a few weeks of the child's death, one from Wasting, one from Peritonitis, one (illegitimate) from Syphilis, and eight (one illegitimate) from Diarrhoea, Enteritis and Gastritis—of these eight, four were in the Union Infirmary for some time, and died there, and one had also the complication of Acute Bronchitis. "Of the 3,488 infants visited 72 were premature (Clapham, North, eight; Clapham, South, one; Putney four, Streatham two, Balham two, Tooting six, Southfield 14, Fairfield 15 and Springfield 20); of these nine died (Clapham, North, one, Streatham, one, Balham one, Tooting one, Southfield one, Fairfield two). 26 were delicate from birth (Clapham, North, one; Clapham, South, one; Putney two, Streatham two, Balham three, Tooting four, Southfield one, Fairfield four, Springfield eight), and of these six died (Clapham, South, one; Streatham two, Tooting one, Fairfield one, Springfield one). 109 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "This year we endeavoured to trace every illegitimate birth registered, including those in the Workhouse. Four wrong addresses were given (Clapham, North, Balham, Tooting and Springfield), 20 removed immediately after confinement, five being here for confinement only—(Clapham, Norths three; Putney two, Streatham three, Balham five, Tooting one, Southfield two, Springfield four), and five died previous to our visit (Balham one, Tooting one, Southfield two,. Springfield one). Four were put out to nurse immediately after birth (Putney one, Southfield one, Fairfield two), no information was obtained in two cases (Tooting one, Springfield one), and eight of those born in the Workhouse remained there (Clapham, North, one; Balham one, Tooting three, Fairfield two, Springfield one). Of the 113 visited" (Clapham, North, four; Clapham, South, 11; Putney three,. Streatham 13, Balham 23, Tooting 20, Southfield 13, Fairfield seven, Springfield 19), 24 came into the Borough for confinement only (Clapham, North, two; Clapham, South, six; Streatham two, Balham eight, Tooting two, Southfield two, Fairfield one, Springfield one). At the first visit 52 werewholly breast fed (Clapham, North, two; Clapham, South,, four; Streatham eight, Balham eight, Tooting seven, Southfield six, Fairfield four, Springfield 13), and at the second visit 10 (Streatham two, Balham three, Tooting one, Springfield four). 28 had removed when the second call was made and could not be traced (Clapham, South, five; Streatham three, Balham seven, Tooting three, Southfield five, Fairfield two, Springfield three). Eight of those visited died (Clapham, South, one; Putney one, Tooting two, Southfield one, Fairfield one, Springfield two), four from Bronchitis, three from Diarrhoea and Enteritis, and one from Congenital Syphilis. "Table LV. shows the number of re-visits, and the method of feeding then found, the average age at the second visit being from four to five months. "The proportion of infants entirely breast fed this year is again practically the same as last, while the proportion of those having milk or food in addition to the breast is slightly higher. There is very little variation in the proportion of 110 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. those having cows' or condensed milk, but there is a slight increase in the use of farinaceous and other foods. This' applies to the method of feeding at the first visit. "With regard to the feeding at the second visit, there is a decrease in the proportion of those wholly breast fed, 62 as against 65 per cent., and a slight increase in the proportion of those having cows' milk only. On the other hand there is a decrease in the proportion of those having farinaceous and other foods, '69, as against i'i6 last year. The food given in addition to the breast is chiefly biscuit; very little bread-sop is now given, 'nursery biscuits' having taken its place. "The majority of the bottles used are of the boat shape, 776 of these being given (Clapham, North, 43; Clapham, South, 54; Putney 29, Streatham 80, Balham 112, Tooting 186, Southfield 85, Fairfield 70, Springfield 120), as against 132 tube bottles (Clapham, North, nine; Clapham, South, 14; Putney four, Streatham 15, Balham 33, Tooting 35, Southfield five, Fairfield five, Springfield 12). Both boat and tube bottles were in use in 20 cases (Clapham, South, three; Putney one, Streatham three, Balham seven, Tooting three, Fairfield one, Springfield two), and spoons in 134 (Clapham, North, three; Clapham, South, 15; Putney one, Streatham 17, Balham 19, Tooting 32, Southfield 18, Fairfield 11, Springfield 18). In 35 instances (Clapham, North, two; Clapham, South, five; Putney one, Streatham eight, Balham seven, Tooting five, Southfield two, Fairfield one, Springfield four), where tube bottles were being used at our first visit we found boat bottles substituted at the second visit. "We have this year in our talks with the mothers laid special stress on the dangers arising from the use of comforters or dummies, as we found the majority of babies were having them. In many instances the mother owned that the child refused to take it at first, but by dint of constantly putting it into the month the baby got used to it. In several cases the dummy was dipped into condensed milk before being given. 111 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "In only 792 cases were comforters not in use (Clapham, North, 73; Clapham, South, 22; Putney 35, Streatham 39, Balham 41, Tooting 61, Southfield 116, Fairfield 133, Springfield 272). In 90 instances where they were in use at the first visit they were discontinued at the second (Clapham, North, four; Clapham, South, seven; Putney six, Streatham four, Balham seven, Tooting 14, Southfield 10, Fairfield 12, Springfield 26). "With regard to the employment of midwives, out of the 3,488 mothers visited 1,342 availed themselves of their services. Of these, 1,073 employed midwives registered under the London County Council (Clapham, North, 64; Clapham, South, 48; Putney 63, Streatham 52, Balham 151, Tooting 223, Southfield 97, Fairfield 86, Springfield 289). The nonregistered midwives were employed chiefly by the very poor (Clapham, North, one; Clapham, South, 16; Putney 11, Streatham 26, Balham 37, Tooting 48, Southfield 36, Fairfield 46, Springfield 48), and during the early part of the year, as in accordance with the Midwives Act, they were prohibited from practising after April 1st, 1910. Any case of infringement of the Act discovered by us we have at once reported to you. "The sanitary defects found in the course of our work were remedied, or if involving structural work, referred to you. 200 intimation notices were served (Clapham, South, 14; Putney one, Streatham 17, Balham 32, Tooting 61, Southfield 11, Fairfield 25, Springfield 39), and 14 statutory notices were required (Balham two, Tooting seven, Southfield one, and Springfield four)." 112 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Of the 3,488 infants visited, it was found that 2,784, or 79'8. per cent., were wholly breast fed, while 704, or 20.2 per cent., were otherwise fed. If we add to the number wholly breast fed the number of children in which other foods were given in addition we find that the percentage is increased to 88.5, a slight decrease compared with the previous year. 235, or 6.7 per cent., were fed on cows' milk only, but 18 had other foods in addition, raising the percentage to 7.2, a decrease compared with 1908 and 1909, when the percentages were 7.2 and 6.4 respectively. 120 had condensed milk only, and 11 had condensed milk and food, a total of 131, or 3.7 per cent., an increase of .1 per cent. compared with 1909. 16 infants were fed on farinaceous and other foods, compared with eight in the previous year. With reference to the infants re-visited, it was found that out of a total of 2,012, 1,251 or 62.1 per cent. were still breast fed only, compared with 65 per cent. in 1909; while taking other foods with the breast the percentage was 75. The total number of deaths among those visited by theInspectors was 79 (eight in Clapham, two in Putney, 15 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 45 in Wandsworth). Table LVI. shows these deaths arranged in monthly age periods.

Other Septic Diseases. 12 deaths were caused by other Septic diseases, three in Clapham, five in Streatham, and four in Wandsworth. Of these five were stated to have been due to Malignant or Septic Endocarditis, and seven to Septicaemia. One death was caused by Intermittent Fever or Malaria, the disease having been contracted abroad. Glanders and Anthrax Orders. Under the above Orders two cases of Anthrax and six cases of Glanders were notified by the Veterinary Inspectors of the London County Council. In these cases the necessary steps in connection with the disinfection and cleansing of the premises were taken by the officials of the London County Council, but the officers of the Borough Council visited the premises and obtained the names of any men who had been in contact with the diseased animals and notified them that if any symptoms of illness appeared the fact should be at once reported.

There has been a slight increase in the rate from this disease compared with the previous year and with the decennial average, -and in the various sub-districts there has been a considerable increase in Clapham and Putney, a slight increase in Wandsworth, but a decrease in Streatham and Tooting. It is specially 120 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. noticeable that the death-rate in Tooting is the lowest of all the sub-districts, not only for 1910, but during the whole of the 10 years. In the decennium 1851-1860 this rate for England and Wales was only 32.5, but it increased in 1891-1900 to 75.8, and for London only in the decennium 1851-1860 it was 42, and for 18911900 85, or slightly more than double. Tubercular Diseases. The total number of deaths from diseases of a Tuberculous; nature was 351, compared with 362 in 1909, 382 in 1908, 352 inv 1907, 376 in 1906, 360 in 1905, and 380 in 1904. 264 of the deaths were due to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 52 to Tubercular disease of the Brain, and 35 to other forms of Tubercular diseases. The number of deaths from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and other Tubercular diseases and the rates per 1,000 for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts are shown ia the next Table. The corrected death-rate from Tubercular disease of the Lungs was .76 per 1,000, compared with .8o in 1909, .83 in 1908, .81 in 1907, .86 in 1906, .93 in 1905, and 1.07 in 1904; from other Tubercular diseases .25, compared with .26, .33, .28, .35, .33 and .36; and from all Tubercular diseases 1.01, compared with 1.06, 1.16, 1.09, 1.21, 1.26, and 1.43. 121 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

With regard to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, the rates for Streatham, Tooting and Wandsworth were above, and those for Clapham and Putney under last year's rates. From other Tubercular disease the rate was .01 lower than in 1909. This rate was lowest in Clapham and highest in Streatham, and the rate for Tubercular disease of the Lungs was lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting. The following Table shows the death-rate per 100,000 from Tubercular disease of the Lungs for the whole Borough, and for the separate sub-districts for the year, as well as for the preceding 10 years. 122 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

One death from Tubercular disease of the Lungs occurred in an infant under one year, three in persons from one to five years, 12 from five to 15 years, 53 from 15 to 25 years, 178 from 25 to 65 years, and 17 over 65 years. From other Tubercular diseases 13 deaths occurred under one year, 40 from one to five years, 15 from five to 15 years, 10 from 15 to 25 years, and nine from 25 to 65 years.

As was the case in 1909, clerks, labourers and shop salesmen head the list, the numbers being respectively 28, 18, and 10. Among females, of 113 deaths, 17 only were engaged in some occupation, three being domestic servants, two were dressmakers, two charwomen, and two nurses. Although there are a large number of unmarried women engaged in laundries in the Borough no death from Phthisis occurred among these during the year, only one in 1909, and none in 1908. 16 of the 113 females had been widows, wives or daughters of artisans, 28 of the labouring class, 24 of travellers or clerks, four were children, and 21 had no occupation. The next Table shows the deaths and death rates in males and females from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, and for other Tubercular diseases, as well as the deaths and death-rates among •children under five years from other Tubercular diseases, for the 10 years 1900-1909, and for the year 1910. Among males the rate for Tubercular disease of the Lungs for the year 1910 was .98, compared with 1.16 the decennial average; and among females 59, compared with .74; while from 126 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. other Tubercular diseases the rate among males was .26, compared with .42; and among females .20, compared with .31. Among children under five years the rate for the year was .15, compared with .23, the decennial average. Although there has been a slight reduction in the rate for 1910, compared with the previous 10 years, yet this reduction will not be so great if the population has been overestimated, a possible error which can only be corrected after the publication of the Census returns for 1911. I am still of opinion that compulsory notification of all cases of this disease is necessary before any great reduction can occur, and also that some further action will require to be taken by Sanitary Authorities. At the present time the methods adopted by some Authorities are— (1) Sanatorium treatment. This can only deal with a few cases at a time, and which also has this objection, that it is a very expensive form of treatment. Among the well-to-do the curative value of sanatoria may be great, but this means prolonged stay in the sanatorium and residence under healthy conditions afterwards. Among the poor a prolonged stay is as a rule impossible, and, even if partially cured, a return to town life in many cases leads to a recrudescence of the disease. (2) Tuberculosis Dispensaries are now being established by several Sanitary Authorities, most of them on the lines of the Royal Victoria Dispensary for Consumption in Edinburgh, started about 20 years ago by Dr. R. W. Philip. In the Borough of Paddington, where a charitably supported dispensary was started in January, 1909, good work is being done, not only in examination of patients at the dispensary, but also in visiting the homes of the patients to arrange and supervise the treatment, and also to examine the other members of the family so that early cases may be at once detected and treated. 127 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 857 patients, 351 males and 506 females, were examined, and of these, 298, 126 males and 172 females, were definitely suffering from Phthisis. 295, 127 males and 168 females, were suspected to be suffering from other forms of Tuberculous diseases, while 249 were not Tuberculous. (3) Tuberculosis Dispensaries in which Tuberculin treatment in addition to home visiting is carried out. This is a comparatively new scheme for dealing with the disease, and has only recently been suggested. Treatment by Tuberculin promises good results as it is by far the cheapest method from an official point of view, and what is most important the patient, if in the initial stage of the disease, can continue at his ordinary work. It will be several years before any definite statistical results are available, showing the percentage of cure by this method, but so far as can be judged by the results already published, the percentage of cures is considerably greater than by any other method. A Tuberculosis Dispensary is being started in Portsmouth, and the results will be watched with interest by all those engaged in battling with this universal disease. It is in my opinion certain that in this Borough the establishment of a Tuberculosis Dispensary with Tuberculin treatment would be largely utilised, especially in the sub-districts of Wandsworth and Tooting, where, as far as can be ascertained, the incidence of the disease is greatest, and it is to be hoped that at no distant period some such institution, either charitably supported or rate supported, or both, will be available for consumptive patients. Compared with London as a whole the mortality in this Borough was .76 compared with 1.14, while the only other Boroughs in the Metropolis with a lower rate were Lewisham .52, and Hampstead .58 per 1,000. 128 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Of the 77 certificates from Superintending Officers in the Wandsworth Union, 63 were received from the Union Infirmary and 14 from the Tooting Home. The 96 certificates received related to 86 cases, two cases having been notified three times and six cases twice. k 2 132 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 22 cases were notified as having gone to addresses in Clapham, two in Putney, 21 in Streatham, 10 in Tooting, and 31 in Wandsworth. One in Wandsworth was discharged to a Common Lodging-House, and one discharged from Willesden comes to Wandsworth at intervals for a few days, and then returns to Willesden Infirmary. 19 of the cases allocated to Tooting were notified from Leavesden Asylum as having been received from Tooting Bee Asylum, no home address being given. The next Table shows the number of cases notified voluntarily by medical practitioners in the Borough. During the year 75 cases of Phthisis were voluntarily notified, 11 belonging to Clapham, seven to Putney, 10 to Streatham, 11 to Tooting, and 36 to Wandsworth, compared with 74 in 1909, 85 in 1908, 49 in 1907, 74 in 1906, and 104 in 1905. Of the 75 cases notified, 29 were notified from the Brompton Hospital, one from a Military Hospital, three from Westminster Hospital, and 42 were notified by private practitioners. At the close of the year 1910, there were 81 peases still on the register, but one case notified in 1904, and four cases notified in 1908, have since become Poor Law cases, leaving 76 cases notified by private practitioners still under observation. 28 of the cases died, one of these having been notified in 1908, 16 in 1909, and 11 in 1910. 133 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

One of the cases was an infant under one year, four from one to five years, 20 from five to 15 years, 43 from 15 to 25 years, 212 from 25 to 65 years, and 14 over 65 years. During the year notification of 22 cases of Consumption were received from the Medical Officer to the Education Department of the London County Council. These cases had been discovered in examination of children at schools. 134 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 22 cases 15 had a definite family history, in one no information could be obtained, and in six no definite family history could be traced. Dr. Kerr in his report states that Tubercle as an evident cause of disease is not common in schools, in the form of pronounced Consumption being rare, not exceeding three per 1,000. He also remarks, however, that there are a large number of children in whom this disease is suspected. In France, Germany and Austria, where the children are tested with Tuberculin, the proportion of children in whom reaction is obtained is very large, and Dr. Kerr remarks that practically every child is infected by Tubercle, but these mostly get over it before school days are past. If this be the case in this country then it is a very strong argument for the establishment of a Tuberculosis Dispensary. The whole of the work in connection with these cases has been carried out by the female Sanitary Inspectors, and I am able to report that it was done in a most thorough and satisfactory manner. The total number of visits paid was 646, 122 in Clapham, 47 in Putney, 112 in Streatham, 79 in Tooting, and 286 in Wandsworth. As in previous years, the pamphlet which has been in use since 1903 was left, and the instructions thereon were in most of the cases carried out. During the year 12 sputum bottles have been supplied, and two were returned after the death of the patient. 135 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 294 cases visited by the Inspectors it was possible to obtain a definite history of infection in 89. In five of the cases the father of the patient had died of Consumption, in 11 the mother, in four the sister, in five the husband, in seven the brother, in four the wife, in one the father and mother, in one father and sister, in six father and other relations, in four the mother and brother, in one the mother and other relation, in three the brother and sister, in three brother and other relation, and in one the sister and other relations. In three of the cases the family history was exceedingly bad, in one, four brothers, eight sisters and six other relations had died of Consumption; in one, the father, husband, brother, son, and another relation, and in one the father, two brothers, one sister, and two sons. In 103 of the cases no history of infection could be ascertained, in 47 no information could be obtained, and in 56 no inquiries were made. Of these 56, 19 were notified from Tooting Bee Asylum, 23 from the Workhouse, one from the Prison, one from Tooting Home, while in 11 the medical attendant did not wish any inquiries to be made. During the year disinfection was carried out at 265 premises, either after the death or removal of the patient, compared with 255 in 1909, 184 in 1908 and 135 in 1907. 56 of the premises disinfected were in Clapham, 25 in Putney, 56 in Streatham, 30 in Tooting, and 98 in Wandsworth. Deaths from Phthisis in Public Institutions. The following Table shows the number of deaths and the rate to total deaths from this disease for the year 1910, and for the previous 10 years:— 136 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The rate in the Union Infirmary shows an increase compared with the decennial average, but a decrease compared with 1909, and the rate in the General and Special Hospitals has also increased. 137 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Bacteriological Examination of Sputum. 143 examinations of sputum were made at the Lister Institute : 14 from Clapham, three from Putney, 51 from Streatham, 10 from Tooting, and 65 from Wandsworth. In 42 of the cases it was reported that the bacillus had been found, and in 101 that it was absent. Circulatory Diseases.

The greatest number of deaths from these diseases occurred among persons from 25 to 65 years and over 65 years. From Chronic Bronchitis alone 96 deaths occurred among persons over 65 years of age, compared with 126 in 1909. 139 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Premature Birth and Developmental Diseases. 249 deaths, 151 of males and 98 of females, were registered as having occurred from these diseases, compared with 254 in 1909, 294 in 1908, 285 in 1907, 315 in 1906, and 317 in 1905. The number of deaths is thus five under last year, and 105 under the corrected decennial average. 110 of the deaths were due to Premature Birth and 139 to Developmental diseases. 244 were of infants under one year, three of children from one to five years, and two over five years. The number of deaths from these diseases is shown more in detail in an earlier part of this Report in Tables XXII. to XXVIII., which deal with Infantile Mortality.

From Accidents and diseases of Parturition 12 deaths occurred, one from 15 to 25 years, and 11 from 25 to 65 years. This, added to the number of deaths from Puerperal Fever, viz., five, gives a total of 17 deaths after child-birth, or a proportion of 2.44 per 1,000 births, compared with 3.14 in 1909. In England and Wales for the year 1909, which is the latest available report,, this rate was 3.70 and in the 10 years immediately preceding, the average proportion had been 4.22 per 1,000 births.

Deaths and Causes of Death in Public Institutions. In the Public Institutions in the Borough 723 deaths occurred during the year, compared with 837 in 1909, 818 in 1908, 807 in 1907, 771 in 1906, 729 in 1905, and 669 in 1904. Of these, 564 deaths were of persons not belonging to the Borough, compared with 656 in 1909, and 159 of persons belonging to the Borough,, compared with 181 in 1909. The decrease was largely due to the decrease in the number of deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough. In Clapham 59 deaths occurred in the Hostel of God, nine of these being Borough residents. Of these, 35 were due to Cancer,. 19 to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, one from Old Age, one from other Tubercular disease, one from Nephritis, and two from, other causes. In Putney two deaths occurred in the Priory, Roehampton,. both from diseases of the Nervous System. In Streatham there were seven deaths in St. Anne's Home and five in the Middlesex County Asylum Annexe.

In Tooting 412 deaths occurred in Public Institutions, 261 in Tooting Bee Asylum, 54 in the Fever Hospitals, 94 in Tooting Home, and three in Newlands House Asylum. 84 of these—49 in the Tooting Home, 24 in the Fever Hospitals, and 11 in Tooting Bee Asylum—were of persons belonging to this Borough. 147 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 261 deaths in the Tooting Bee Asylum, 118 were from Old Age, five from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, eight from other forms of Tuberculosis, 53 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, 19 from diseases of the Heart, 29 from diseases of the Nervous System, three from Bright's disease, five from Cancer, three from Accident, and 18 from all other causes. In the Fever Hospitals 54 deaths occurred, 24 of which belonged to the Borough, compared with 84 in 1909, 126 in 1908,, 53 in 1907, 55 in 1906, and 50 in 1905. 19 of these deaths were from Scarlet Fever, 27 from Diphtheria, one from Measles, two from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, three from Tuberculous, Meningitis, one from Accident, and one from other causes. 94 deaths occurred in the Tooting Home, 49 of which wereBorough residents. 24 of these were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 31 from Old Age, 12 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, seven from Cancer, two from Organic disease of the Heart, and 18 from all other causes. In Wandsworth 73 deaths occurred in the Middlesex County^ Asylum, 12 in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, eight in the Prison, and 30 in the Workhouse. Of the 73 deaths in the Middlesex County Asylum, 10 were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, four from Old Age, eight from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, four from Bright's disease, four from Enteritis, two from other forms of Tubercular diseases, three from Cancer, 24 from diseases of the Brain and Nervous System (of which 15 were from General Paralysis of the Insane, three from Epilepsy, three from Apoplexy, and two from Softening of the Brain), four from Heart disease, and 10 from other causes. Of the 12 deaths in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, one was from Tubercular disease, one from Bright's disease, and 10 from all other causes. l 2 148 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the eight deaths in the Prison, one was from Tubercular disease, three from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, one from Cancer, one from Bright's disease, one from Enteric Fever, and one was a case of Execution. Of the 30 deaths in the Workhouse, 11 were from Old Age, eight from Premature Birth and Developmental diseases, one from diseases of Parturition, one from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, two from diseases of the Heart, two from Softening of the Brain, and five from other causes. In other places not Institutions 105 deaths occurred, 12 of these being from Accidents, five from Cancer, 10 from Suicide, four from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, three from disease of the Heart, nine from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, four from Old Age, two from Nephritis, seven from Premature Birth and Developmental diseases, and 49 from all other causes. 29 of these deaths occurred in Private Nursing Homes, three in the River Thames, and two in the River Wandle. There has again been a marked increase in the number of deaths in Institutions, and to show that the increase has been going on for some years, the following Table has been prepared. The comparative percentages for London are also shown, and it will be noted that in the 20 years 1889-1908 these increased in London from 24.5 to 41.9 with an average of 31*14, and in Wandsworth from 15.2 to 28.7, with an average of 19.45. In this Borough the percentage is lower than for the whole of London, and this is what might be expected in consequence of the social condition of the population, but in spite of the better social condition, it is rather startling to find that over 30 per cent. of the total deaths occurred in Institutions, and that for the year 1909 16 per cent. occurred in the Workhouse and Workhouse Infirmary. Compared with the 20 years' average, the greatest increase has occurred among the deaths in Workhouse and Workhouse Infirmaries, while the rate in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals is slightly lower.

Cutting-off Notices. During the year 76 notices with respect to 104 premises were received from the Water Board stating that the supply had been withdrawn. 15 of the premises were in Clapham, 19 in Putney, 31 in Streatham, 15 in Tooting, and 24 in Wandsworth. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rates from 46 premises, from 23 premises in consequence of defects, in 20 the premises were empty, in 13 the supply was withdrawn by request, and in two the reason was not stated. Compared with 1909, there has been a decrease in the number of notices received, chiefly in consequence of defects and at the request of the owners. Mortuaries. The Mortuaries in Clapham and Streatham have been visited several times during the year, and I am able to report that the By-laws and Regulations have been carried out in a satisfactory manner. With reference to the Wandsworth Mortuary the Public Health Committee has had the question of providing a new mortuary for Wandsworth before them, but so far no decision as to the site has been arrived at. The Mortuary at Tooting has been closed, but a temporary one has been provided pending the erection of a new one in Wandsworth. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 151 In Clapham, 21 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, compared with 38 in 1909; in Streatham 56, compared with 55; and in Wandsworth 109, of which 60 were from Wandsworth, 33 from Putney, and 16 from Tooting-—a total of 186, compared with 206 in 1909. General Sanitary Work in 1910. The following list shows the special inspections made by me during the year :— (1.) In consequence of several complaints of flooding from the River Wandle, special inspections were made on several occasions during the year of the whole course of the River from the Borough boundary to the River Thames, but it was found that only at one part of the River was there any flooding of occupied houses, viz. : in Lydden Grove. The attention of the owners was called to the matter, and the London County Council was also informed, but owing to the absence of heavy rainfall the flooding did not recur. If the flooding does recur it will be necessary for the owners to construct a proper retaining wall. (2.) As in previous years, special inspections were made of several localities in consequence of complaints of smells from road gullies and sewer ventilators. The number of complaints was greater than in the previous year, especially in Wandsworth ; this having been due to the fact that the climatic conditions were favourable. In all 117 complaints were received, compared with 79 in 1909: six from Clapham North, five from Clapham South, 22 from Putney, 18 from Streatham, 16 from Balham, 15 from Tooting, 21 from Southfield, and 14 from Springfield Wards. 152 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. All these complaints were forwarded to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, who reported that in every case the necessary cleansing and flushing or other work had been carried out. (3.) A large number of inspections were again made of passages and mews, and a considerable number of these have been satisfactorily dealt with during the year, but in some, owing to legal difficulties as to ownership, no work has yet been begun to comply with the notices served. (a) The roadway in Voltaire Road leading to stables has been made up with macadam and rolled. (b) Station Yard, Wandsworth Road. Roadway made up with macadam and rolled. (c) Passage at rear of 125 to 133, High Street, ham, has been properly paved. (d) Passage at rear of 288 to 312, Upper Richmond Road, Putney, has been properly paved. (e) Passages at rear of 137 to 141, and 143 to 149, Lower Richmond Road, Putney, have been properly paved. (f) Passage at rear of 566 to 580, Streatham High Road has been properly paved. (g) Passage at rear of 2 to 12, Eastwood Street, Streatham, has been properly paved. (h) Passage in Lammermoor Road, Balham, has been made up with macadam and rolled. (i) Passage at rear of 268 to 270, Upper Tooting Road. Balham, has been satisfactorily concreted. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 153 (k) Land at rear of Blackshaw Road, Tooting. The works are now being carried out to properly pave and drain this open space. (l) Other passages in Streatham as Sistova Road Mews, Grove Road Mews, passage at rear of 63 to 67, Balham High Road, and 51 to 57, Streatham High Road, have also been dealt with and any nuisance abated. (m) Passages at rear of 121 to 133, and 108 to 114, Mitcham Road, Tooting, have been repaired, and the passage at rear of 98 to 106 has been partially concreted. (n) Nuisance has also been abated at passage at rear of 854 to 856, Garratt Lane, and in Aldis Mews, and Angel Court, Tooting. (o) Cumbers Yard, Wandsworth, has been satisfactorily concreted. (p) Potters Court, Putney Bridge Road, Wandsworth, has been properly tar paved. (q) Passage at rear of 22, Putney Bridge Road to Marters Cottages has been drained and properly paved. (r) Passage at rear of 759 to 767, Garratt Lane has been satisfactorily concreted and drained. (s) Other passages in Wandsworth have been dealt with and the nuisance abated, viz.: passage at rear of 16 to 24, East Hill, rear of 91 to 99, East Hill, 77 to 95, High Street, Swan Yard, at rear of 3 to 8, Wandsworth Plain, pathway leading to Wheatsheaf Cottages, Putney Bridge Road, and the passages at rear of 91 to 125, Brookwood Road. 154 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The passage at rear of Furzedown Market, Tooting, has not yet been properly paved, although some work was carried out which temporarily abated the nuisance. Steps are, however, being taken to deal with this under the Metropolis. Management Act. There has been a very great improvement in the condition of these passages since the works were completed, and this is also the case in regard to the other passages dealt with in previous years. (4.) Special house-to-house inspections were made during the year in Young's Rents, Rowland's Cottages, Wirtemberg Street, North Street, and Manor Street, Clapham; Bigg's Row, Labourers' Cottages, and Brewhouse Lane, Putney; Sunnyhill Road, Wellfield Road, Edgington Road, Hazelhurst Road and Foss Road, Streatham; Salvador and Shepherd's Close, Tooting; and King's Arms Yard, Stockwell Court, Marters Cottages, Cumbers Yard, Point Pleasant, and Ram Square, Wandsworth. These inspections were made chiefly on account of the damp conditions reported to me by the Sanitary Inspectors, and also to ascertain if any of these premises could be reported to the Council under the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act. Including the house-to-house inspections and inspections for certificates under the Revenue Act, but excluding the routine inspection of bakehouses, slaughter-houses, cowsheds, and offensive trade premises, 1,310 inspections were made of premises, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notices. My attendance at the Police Court was necessary on 16, at the Sessions on one, and at the County Court on two occasions. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 155 Revenue Act. During the year 14 certificates were granted under the above Act, one was deferred, and two refused. The certificates granted referred to 73 houses, or 147 tenements. Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909. In this Borough, where the great majority of the houses are comparatively new, the number of houses which at the present could be dealt with under the above Act is very small, as an inspection of the whole Borough shows. There are, however, some small properties in the older parts where it was necessary to take action, and five houses were closed under Section 17 of the above Act. Four of these houses were situated in Putney and one in Wandsworth, and after reporting on the matter to the Public Health Committee the premises were closed by the owner after notice. Nothing has so far been done by the owner to render the houses fit for habitation. The question of taking action under Section 18 of the Act will be considered by the Committee in the current year. Three other houses, in Clapham, were reported on, but the Committee after inspecting the houses were of opinion that they could be dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, and notices were served under that Act, which were complied with. 156 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Sanitary Operations. The Table of Sanitary operations shows in detail the amount and nature of the work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. The number of complaints received and attended to was 1,789, compared with 1,692 in 1909, 1,645 in 1908, and 1,836 in 1907. I here was an increase in Putney, Streatham, Balham, Tooting, Southfield, Fairfield and Springfield Wards, and a decrease in Clapham North and South Wards. Seven of these complaints were made to the London County Council, and these were at once attended to. The number of houses and premises inspected was 29,931, an increase of 3,096 compared with 1909, and of 5,039 compared with 1908. There was an increase in the number of houses and premises inspected in Clapham North and South, Putney, Streatham, Balham, Tooting, Southfield and Springfield Wards, and a decrease in Fairfield Ward. The total number of house-to-house inspections made was 6,276, compared with 7,007 in 1909, 5,575 in 1908, 5,718 in 1907, 5,686 in 1906, and 6,290 in 1905. There has been an increase in the number of house-to-house inspections in Putney, Tooting, and Southfield Wards, and a decrease in Clapham North and South, Streatham, Balham, Fairfield, and Springfield Wards. In Tooting alone the number increased from 226 in 1908 and 769 in 1909, to 850 in 1910, and in Putney from 649 in 1909 to 806 in 1910. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 157 The principal reason why the number of house-to-house inspections is lower is due to the fact that the whole system of recording these inspections was in the last three months of the year re-organised, as it was found that the records previously kept did not contain all the matters dealt with by the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act. After much consideration it was decided to adopt a card system of recording these inspections, and cards were drawn up so that the result of the inspection could be entered by the Sanitary Inspector at the time of making his house-to-house inspection. The cards are, after completion by the Inspector, filed according to streets, thus making the work of future reference an easy matter. Although the work of inspecting a house and the entering of all the information at the time occupies more of the time of the Inspector yet the system will, in my opinion, prove a more complete and satisfactory one, and it will also save a large amount of clerical work which had to be performed at the Office. The details of the card are as follows:— 158 Report of the Medical Officer of Health HOUSE-TO-HOUSE INSPECTION CARD.

In 3,920 out of a total of 6,276 houses inspected, or 62.46 per cent., sanitary defects necessitating the service of an intimation notice were found. The highest percentage was in the Streatham Ward, where the percentage was 85.84, and the lowest in Clapham South, where it was only 54.24, the next lowest being Clapham North Ward, where it was 55.05. The following Table, which is prepared from the figures given in the summary, shows the percentage to total number of families of those living in one, two, three, or four rooms and upwards, in the separate Wards and in the whole Borough, in the premises inspected in 1910.

Fairfield and Springfield Wards had the highest percentage of families living in one room, and Putney the lowest. Fairfield and Springfield had the highest percentage living in two rooms, and Tooting the lowest. Putney had the highest percentage living in three rooms, and Clapham North the lowest. Tooting and Clapham North had the highest percentage living in four rooms and upwards, and Fairfield the lowest. In the Borough, of the total families whose houses were inspected during the year, viz., 8,702, 7.4 per cent. lived in one room, compared with 7.3 per cent. in 1909, 7.6 per cent. in 1908, and 6.9 per cent. in 1907; 9.5 per cent. in two rooms, compared with 10.3, 11.8 and 10.4; 29.06 per cent. in three rooms, compared with 27.5, 29.7 and 34.7; and 54 per cent. in four rooms and upwards, compared with 54.9, 50.9 and 48. The small number of house-to-house inspections in Fairfield Ward was due to the fact that the Inspector of that Ward has also a portion of Southfield and Sprigfield Wards under his supervision, and the house-to-house inspections carried out by him during the year were chiefly in the Southfield Ward, in which there was a considerable increase, compared with previous years.

The greatest number of intimation notices was served in Southfield and Springfield Wards, and the smallest number in Fairfield and Putney Wards. The greatest number of statutory notices was served in Balham and Springfield Wards, and the smallest number in Putney and Clapham South Wards. 126 of the statutory notices, 21 in Clapham, six in Putney, 32 in Streatham, six in Tooting, and 61 in Wandsworth, served in 1910, were not complied with at the close of the year. These notices were served in November and December, and with the exception of 18 premises which were vacated after service of the notices, and of 30 which were in hand, were complied with in the early months of the current year. Of the 30 in hand the majority were notices for paving yards or open spaces which could not be complied with owing to climatic conditions. The number of statutory notices served include By-law notices, 394 of which were served in respect of the following contraventions of the By-laws:—Yard paving 179, repairs to water closets 38, repairs to flushing apparatus of water closets 49, cleansing of water closets two, covers to cisterns 16, cleansing cisterns 11, cleansing house and other contraventions of the By-laws as to houses let in lodgings 73, paving and draining stables one, absence of cover to manure receptacles seven, paving of pig sties one, and failing to deposit manure in a proper receptacle 17.

Seven of these were in Clapham, three in Putney, 18 in Streatham, 13 in Tooting, and 88 in Wandsworth. 174 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The cases of overcrowding in Clapham were chiefly in Crichton Street; in Putney, in Quill Lane; in Streatham, in Larch Road, Zennor Road, and Moffat Road; in Tooting, in Fountain Road; and in Wandsworth, in Guelph Street, Lydden Road, Bendon Valley, and Lydden Grove. Nearly all the cases were caused by sub-letting rooms, largely in consequence of the original occupier being out of employment. All the cases were remedied without difficulty, and it was not necessary to take any Police Court proceedings. 1,060 ashpits were provided or repaired, compared with 1,292 in 1909, and 336 complaints with reference to the non-removal of house refuse (66 from Clapham, 41 from Putney, 99 from Streatham, 14 from Tooting, and 116 from Wandsworth) were received during the year. These complaints were, as in previous years, attended to by the Dusting Inspectors. 1,437 yards in connection with dwelling-houses, and 97 in connection with stables, were paved, drained, or cleansed, compared with 1,574 ancl 95 in 1909. 6,010 rooms and 1,266 staircases and passages were cleansed or repaired, compared with 7,301 rooms and 1,519 staircases and passages in 1909. The greatest number of rooms cleansed was in the Balham Ward, where 1,163 were done, and in Springfield Ward, where 1,060 were done, and the smallest number in Fairfield and Putney, where the numbers were 285 and 287 respectively. 1,084 drains were cleansed or repaired, and 64 rain-water pipes disconnected from the drains. 114 notices of reconstruction of drains were sent to the Borough Engineer from this Department: 37 in Clapham, compared with 34 in 1909; seven in Putney, compared with five; 36 in Streatham, compared with 51; 13 in Tooting, compared with 14; and 21 in Wandsworth, compared with 40. 175 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of houses where the drains were reconstructed during the year was 280: 65 in Clapham, 19 in Putney, 101 in Streatham, 18 in Tooting-, and 85 in Wandsworth. 361 accumulations of manure were removed after service of notice, compared with 347 in 1909: 78 in Clapham, 46 in Putney, 130 in Streatham, 21 in Tooting, and 86 in Wandsworth. There has been an increase in the number of cases dealt with in Clapham, Putney and Streatham, and a decrease in Tooting and Wandsworth. 38 notices were served for the periodical removal of manure every 48 hours, compared with 50 in 1909 and 55 in 1908. The number of waterclosets cleansed and repaired was 2,149, compared with 2,128 in 1909. The greatest number of these were in Balham and Springfield Wards. 606 drinking water cisterns were cleansed, covered, or repaired: 245 in Clapham, 47 in Putney, 122 in Streatham, 52 in Tooting, and 140 in Wandsworth, compared with 837 in 1909. 138 premises were inspected and notices served where animals were kept in such a manner as to be a nuisance. Five of these were in Clapham, four in Putney, 37 in Streatham, 12 in Tooting, and 80 in Wandsworth. This nuisance was most common in Southfield, Fairfield and Springfield Wards, and the animals kept were chiefly ducks and hens. 68 smoke nuisances were reported during the year: two in Clapham, three in Putney, five in Streatham, and 58 in Wandsworth. Three complaints of black smoke were received from the Public Control Department of the London County Council with regard to three premises, and five complaints from the Coal Smoke Abatement Society with regard to six premises. 176 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. These complaints were all at once attended to and the premises kept under observation. In all, 220 observations for black smoke were made by the Sanitary Inspectors. 68 cases were reported, and 62 notices were served. 153 soil pipes were repaired, 28 in Clapham, 10 in Putney, 43 in Streatham, 57 in Tooting, and 15 in Wandsworth, compared with 182 in 1909 and 125 in 1908. 1,225 leaky roofs and gutters were repaired, compared with 1,159 in 1909 and 945 in 1908. 38 unwholesome or dilapidated houses were cleansed and repaired, four in Clapham, two in Putney, six in Streatham, 10 in Tooting, and 16 in Wandsworth, compared with 46 in 1909. A large amount of work has again been carried out to abate nuisances arising from damp conditions. In all 1,754 premises have been dealt with, 160 in Clapham, 84 in Putney, 520 in Streatham, 192 in Tooting, and 698 in Wandsworth; and in 634 of these, 38 in Clapham, 11 in Putney, 188 in Streatham, 47 in Tooting, and 350 in Wandsworth, damp courses have been Inserted. The number of unclassified nuisances was 746, 262 in Clapbam, 63 in Putney, 248 in Streatham, 41 in Tooting, and 132 in Wandsworth, compared with 719 in 1909. Disinfection. The total number of rooms disinfected after the occurrence of cases of infectious disease was 2,166, (390 in Clapham, 250 in Putney, 564 in Streatham, 448 in Tooting, and 514 in Wandsworth), compared with 3,146 in 1909, 2,868 in 1908, 3,206 in 1907, and 2,794 in 1906. 177 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The decrease was chiefly due to the decrease in the number .of disinfections carried out after Measles, Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 1,230 lots of bedding were stoved at the Disinfecting- Station, .compared with 1,584 in 1909, 1,826 in 1908, 1,948 in 1907, and 1,669 in 1906. The 1,230 lots of bedding included the following:—694 beds, 755 bolsters, 1,916 pillows, 743 mattresses, 341 palliasses, 1,033 sheets, 1,166 quilts, 519 cushions, 4,162 articles of clothing, 2,062 blankets, 168 carpets, and 1,871 extra articles, a total of 15,430 articles, compared with 20,843 in 1909, 24,034 in 1908, 29,102 in 1907, and 28,885 in 1906. 418 premises were disinfected after Measles and 265 after Tubercular disease of the Lungs, compared with 1,012 and 255 in 1909. 27 beds, 11 bolsters, 53 pillows, 44 mattresses, 53 palliasses, 10 sheets, 12 quilts, 20 cushions, 69 articles of clothing, 13 blankets, 17 carpets, and 109 extra articles, were removed and destroyed by request of the owners during the year. Disinfection was also carried out by the Sanitary Staff at premises after non-notifiable diseases, chiefly Cancer, and the sum of £20 7s. od. was received for such disinfection. 277 rooms were disinfected with sulphur in consequence of their verminous condition, and 10 lots of verminous bedding .disinfected. I have regularly visited the Disinfecting Station during the year, and am able to report that the work has been carried out by the staff to my entire satisfaction. N 178 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Only two complaints of damage to goods by disinfection have been received, and on inquiry it was found that the goods were damaged or stained before being placed in the disinfecting chamber. The approximate cost of working and maintaining the Disinfecting Station during the past year, including the cost of disinfectants used in fumigating and cleansing rooms, was as follows: £ s. d. Wages 914 5 2 Fuel 6 8 2 Horse Hire 82 9 0 Stores, Tools, and other materials 59 16 1 Repairs to Horse Vans 14 0 0 Disinfectants, etc. 31 2 2 Repairs to Motor Van — Motor Running Expenses 37 1 8 Lighting 1 17 2 Insurance 9 6 7 Water 4 6 0 £1,160 12 0 The number of lots of bedding stoved was 1,230. Cost per lot of bedding 18s. 10d. Cleansing of Persons Act. The baths at the Disinfecting Station have not been so frequently used this year, chiefly owing to the smaller number of verminous children dealt with. The names of 116 children, 10 belonging to Clapham, six to Putney, 16 to Streatham, 26 to Tooting, and 58 to Wandsworth, stated to be in a verminous condition, were forwarded to me by 179 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. the Medical Officer, Education Department, London County Council, and the homes were visited by the Inspectors. In the majority of cases only the heads of the children were verminous, but in a few cases the bodies and clothing were also verminous. Of these latter, four, two boys and two girls, were cleansed at the baths, and the clothing was at the same time stoved with beneficial results. 15 adults also had baths, five being nurses who had been in attendance on cases of Puerperal Fever, five were contacts with cases of Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria, while five, three females and two males, were verminous. Inspection of Urinals in connection with Licensed Premises. The number of urinals inspected was 149, 33 in Clapham, 20 in Putney, 25 in Streatham, 11 in Tooting, and 60 in Wandsworth. 324 inspections were made during the year and 38 notices, chiefly for cleansing, were served and complied with. Police Court Proceedings. The list which follows shows particulars of Police Court proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the year. The total amount of fines inflicted was £23 4s. od., and the costs £14 7s., compared with £30 17s. 6d. and £11 3s. od. in 1909. N 2 180 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The majority of the cases were with respect to nuisances or . contraventions of By-laws, while four were on account of the absence of a proper supply of water. Two cases were for exposing unsound food for sale, and five for selling milk without being registered as required by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885. 181 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

During the year ending 31st March, 1910, an alteration has been made in the system of removal. The whole of the refuse is now collected and disposed of by contract, with the exception of a portion from the Balham, Streatham and Tooting Wards, which is disposed of at the Destructor. The following Table, taken from the report of the Borough Engineer, shows the quantity collected and the method of disposal in the various Wards of the Borough. i83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Inspection of Milkshops, Cowsheds, &c. The following Table shows in concise form the number of milk premises, cowsheds, etc., on the register, the number of inspections, and the number of cases of legal proceedings during the year, as well as other information which it has been thought advisable to group together for the purpose of comparison with other Metropolitan Boroughs. 184 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Mortuaries— Total number of bodies removed 186 Total number of infectious bodies removed— Milkshops. At the close of 1909 there were 331 milkshops on the Register, 36 have been added in 1910 and 31 removed, leaving 336 on the Register at the end of 1910. During the year 995 inspections were made of these premises and 44 notices, chiefly for cleansing, were served. Five prosecutions were instituted for carrying on the business of a dairyman without being registered, and fines amounting to £5 were imposed, with £.2 15s. costs. The safes provided by purveyors of milk who also sell general goods, have proved very satisfactory in preventing the pollution of the milk, and these purveyors are still of opinion that their provision has effected a decided improvement. Cowsheds. The following is a list of the registered Cowhouses in the district granted by the London County Council in October:— Clapham— London, Gloucester, and North Hants Dairy Company, Ltd., 41, Clifton Street. (10 cows.) Denny, Charles, 128, Wirtemberg Street. (25 cows.) 187 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Putney— James, Messrs., Lower Richmond Road. (Number of cows, Shed No. i—46; Shed No. 2—10.)

Turner, G. S., Headworth Road. (14 cows.) The total number on the Register at the close of 1910 was 12, and 54 inspections were made. Slaughter-houses. There were 18 Slaughter-houses and one Knacker's Yard on the Register in 1909, one in Streatham was removed, leaving 18 on the Register. During the year 457 inspections were made of these, but it was only necessary to serve four notices for cleansing. The usual cleansing was carried out by the occupiers at the proper times. 188 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the year the Inspectors inspected the carcases of 450 cattle, 2,437 sheep, 233 pigs, and 12 calves in Slaughter-houses and Butchers' Shops, and reported that all the animals were healthy. The following list shows the number of Slaughter-houses licensed by the London County Council in October:— Clapham— Masters, Albert, 63, Clapham Park Road, Clapham. (Condition—Small cattle only.) Yarworth, William, 140, Clapham Park Road, Clapham. (Condition—The licence is granted on the undertaking of the licensee that the killing of bullocks at these premises be restricted to the period of hot weather, and then only occasionally, and on the further condition that the slaughtering be limited to animals the meat from which is to be sold by retail in the shop attached to the premises.) Woodman, George, 140, Larkhall Lane, Clapham. Cradock, Albert Henry, 147, Larkhall Lane, Clapham.

Putney— Lindsey, John, Montserratt Road, Putney. (Condition—This licence is granted on the undertaking of the licensee to drive cattle on the premises only between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., and to limit the slaughtering to the requirements of the retail trade of his own shop.) i8g Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Wood, John James, Durnsford Farm, Merton Road. (Condition—This licence is granted on the undertaking of the licensee that his own pigs only be killed at these premises.) Knacker's Yard. Harrison, Barber & Co., Ltd., Garratt Lane. Offensive Trades. The following is a list of offensive trades carried on in the Borough:— (1.) Harrison, Barber & Co., Ltd., Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, Knackers. Do. do. Bone Boilers. Do. do. Manure Manufacturers. 190 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (2.) Dallett & Co., High Street, Putney, Soap Boilers. Do. do. Tallow Melters. (3.) Tucker & Co., Weimar Street, Putney, Soap Boilers. (4.) James Ford, Bendon Valley, Wandsworth, Fat Melter. The premises of Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Co. have been dismantled, and no boiling or melting has been carried on during the year. The premises are now only used for storage, and they are consequently removed from the Register. Ice Cream Premises. At the end of 1909 there were 274 of these on the Register. During 1910 28 were added and 15 removed, leaving a total of 287 on the Register. 427 inspections were made of these premises during the year and 51 notices were served, all of which were for cleansing. Houses Let in Lodgings. At the end of 1909 there were 275 houses let in lodgings on the Register. 17 were added during 1910 and none removed, making a total of 292 on the Register at the end of 1910. 790 inspections of these were made during the year, and 511 notices were served, 59 for overcrowding and 452 for other conditions, chiefly cleansing. With regard to one premises a summons was issued for failing to cleanse, and a conviction was obtained. On the whole the By-laws have been satisfactorily complied with, although in some instances the cleansing was not carried out at the specified time. 191 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Offensive Trade Refuse. No complaints have been received during the year as to the removal of the above refuse, and I am able to report that the arrangement entered into by the Council has been satisfactorily carried out by the Contractor. Unsound Food. During the year, 10 cases of Haddocks, two trunks of Whiting, four boxes of Herrings, one box of Plaice, four boxes of Skate, 6 boxes of Cod, one box Winkles, one trunk of Soles, one box Skate, 29 Hake, 30 Mackerel, 120 lbs. Rock Salmon, 50 boxes of Tomatoes, 5 pecks of Strawberries, 36 Melons, 217 lbs. Beef and 12 Turkeys, were destroyed at the request of the owners, and the usual certificates granted. Factories and Workshops. Although the total number of inspections of factories, workshops and workplaces is less than in 1909, yet a very large amount of work was carried out by the male and female Inspectors during the year. This decrease was chiefly due to the smaller number of inspections of other workshops and workplaces. I am able to report that the condition of all the factories, workshops and workplaces is satisfactory, and that no difficulty has, during the year, been experienced in having the necessary cleansing and other sanitary work carried out by the occupiers. As in former years there has been some slight difficulty in obtaining the lists of outworkers, and it has been found necessary to send a circular letter twice in each year to the majority of employers, otherwise the lists would not have been forwarded. 192 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. This circular letter in all cases was successful in its object, and it was not necessary to take further steps. In nearly all the cases the official forms are now used, thus facilitating the clerical work and filing of the documents. The Tables which follow are similar to those used in previous Reports, and the whole of the work done by both male and female Inspectors is there shown in a concise form. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,707, including 136 retail bakehouses, 153 workshop laundries, 302 dressmakers' and milliners' premises, and 1,116 other workshops, but not including 360 factories, 1,039 workplaces, and 314 outworkers' premises. Including all factories, workshops, workplaces, and outworkers' premises, there were on the Register at the end of 1910 3,420 premises, compared with 3,305 in 1909, 3,347 in 1908, 3,281 in 1907, 3,096 in 1906, 3,045 in 1905, 2,987 in 1904, and 2,676 in 1903. The total number of inspections made during the year was 6,387, compared with 6,531 in 1909, 5,801 in 1908, 6,048 in 1907, 5,997 in 1906, 4,933 in 1905, and 4,946 in 1904. The total number of notices served was 580, 544 intimation and 36 statutory, compared with 597 in 1909, 434 in 1908, 453 in 1907, 427 in 1906, 462 in 1905, and 465 in 1904. There were only two prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, both for sanitary defects. Under the head of other workshops are included domestic workshops, and under the head of places where food is prepared for sale are included the kitchens of hotels, restaurants, tripe, fried fish and eel shops, and other places where food is prepared for sale. 193 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In [all 725 inspections were made of 360 factories, and 61 notices, 59 imitation and two statutory, were served. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,707, 153 of which were workshop laundries, 136 workshop bakehouses, and 1,418 other workshops. In all 3,346 inspections of these were made, compared with .3,366 in 1909, 3,130 in 1908, 3,148 in 1907, 3,233 in 1906, and 2,628 in 1905, and 252 intimation and 22 statutory notices were served. The total number of workplaces on the Register was 1,039, and 1,828 inspections were made, while 197 intimation and 10 statutory notices were served. The total number of defects found was 720, including 11 cases in which there was a breach of special sanitary requirements for bakehouses, compared with 745 and six in 1909. To abate these nuisances 544 intimation and 36 statutory notices were served, all of which, with the exception of 16, were complied with at the end of the year. The 16 outstanding were complied with in the first month of this year. In all, 720 defects were found and 704 remedied, but only 544 intimation notices were served, as one notice frequently called attention to several defects on the same premises. 194 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The table which follows and which relates to Home Work is similar to the one in last year's Report. There has been a decrease of 20 in the number of lists sent in twice a year, and of two in the number sent in once a year. 197 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In all, 132 lists were received twice in the year, containing the names and addresses of 83 contractors and 376 workers, and four lists once in the year, containing the names and addresses of 10 workers. There has been a very great reduction in the number of outworkers employed by employers in the Borough. The total number of addresses received from other Councils was 422, compared with 370 in 1909, 352 in 1908, 322 in 1907, and 173 in 1906, and 253 addresses were forwarded to other Councils, campared with 334 in 1909, 301 in 1908, 325 in 1907, and 122 in 1906. The number of addresses received has increased by 52, and the number sent decreased by 81. The following are the districts to which lists of outworkers were forwarded, and also the number of outworkers:—Lambeth 53, Stepney 44, Battersea 42, Southwark 22, City of London 19, Fulham 15, Merton nine, Camberwell six, Hammersmith five,. St. Pancras, Croydon, Chelsea, and Westmister three each, Bethnal Green, Southampton, Leyton, Islington, Woolwich, Lewisham, Hove, Bermondsey and Stoke Newington two each, West Ham, Acton, Wimbledon, Willesden, Twickenham, Shoreditch, East Ham and Finsbury one each. 94 names and addresses were forwarded to this Borough in error, and are not included in the above Table. The number of notices sent to employers during the year was 100, compared with 127 in 1909, and these had a most satisfactory result, although in a few cases it was also necessary for the Inspector to call and warn them that if such lists were not sent proceedings would be taken. At the end of 1909 there were 312 outworkers' premises on the Register, 73 were added and 71 removed during the year, leaving 314 on the Register. 488 inspections were made of these premises during the year, and 40 notices, all for cleansing, were served and complied with. 198 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the year 14 cases of infectious disease, six of Scarlet Fever, five of Diphtheria, two of Erysipelas, and one of Enteric Fever, were notified as having occurred in the homes of outworkers, compared with six in 1909, 22 in 1908, six in 1907, six in 1906, and five in 1905. In none of these cases was it necessary to make any order under Section 110 of the Factory and Workshop Act. 199 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Table Xc. 3.—tioME work.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. †The figures required in columns 2, 3 and 4 are the total number of the lists received from those employers who comply strictly with the statutory duty of sending two lists each year and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers, as there will be two lists for each employer—in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted. The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. $ In view of the wide discrepancies found to exist between the totals in the two columns when the returns are added together, it is desired that care may be taken to give exact figures. Only those addresses should be counted which have actually been received from or forwarded to other Councils during the year covered by the report, 20j Report of the Medical Officer of Health. table xci. 4.—REGISTERED WORKSHOPS.

The Tables which follow summarises the work done during the year by the female Sanitary Inspectors. The total number of premises inspected was 1,837 (403 in Clapham, 240 in Putney, 465 in Streatham, 181 in Tooting, and 518 in Wandsworth). 173 inspections were made of factories, 1,000 of workshops, 66 of domestic workshops, 373 of workplaces, and 225 of outworkers' premises, while 236 premises were visited for inquiry and no workroom found. There was only one case of overcrowding discovered, compared with two in 1909, four in 1908, four in 1907, five in 1906, 12 in 1905, and 17 in 1904, and this was at once abated. 30 were found to be in a dirty condition, compared with 56 in 1909, 25 in 1908, and 66 in 1907. In every workshop inspected during the year there were separate water closets for the sexes, but in five factories and four workshops the water closets were defective. Other nuisances were discovered in four factories, 25 workshops, one domestic workshop, seven workplaces, and five outworkers' premises, and these were all abated, with three exceptions, and these were abated in January of the current year. It was only necessary to serve 76 intimation notices, and these were all complied with with the exception of three, one in Streatham and two in Tooting. These notices were complied with .in the beginning of the current year. It was necessary to serve four statutory notices during the year, two in Clapham and two in Putney, and these were all complied with. 49 workshops and seven domestic workshops where females were employed were reported to H.M. Inspectors of Workshops, and 83 were reported to this Council by H.M. Inspector. Only 11 of the workshops (two in Clapham, seven in Streatham, one in Tooting, and one in Wandsworth), reported by H.M. Inspector were unknown to the Sanitary Inspectors. The other 72 had been previously reported to H.M. Inspector, or were already on the Register. 2o6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

There has been a slight increase in the numbers, chiefly due to increase in the number of small laundries, 82 of these being now on the Register, compared with 69 in 1909. The total number of dressmakers and milliners, etc., shows a slight increase compared with the previous year. The total number, viz.:—874 (164 in Clapham, no in Putney, 313 in Streatham, 72 in Tooting, and 215 in Wandsworth), is 25 more than in 1909, the greatest increase having occurred in Streatham, while there has been a slight decrease in Clapham and Wandsworth. 211 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

During the past year 1,060 samples of foods and drugs were .submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, compared with 1,030 in 1909, 1,004 in 1908, 989 in 1907, and 905 in 1906. Of these, 96 or 9.05 per cent. were reported to be adulterated, compared with 6.8g per cent. in 1909, 8.76 per cent. in 1908, 8.49 per cent. in 1907, and 9.29 percent, in 1906. The percentage of milk samples found to be adulterated was 7.44, compared with 7.39 in 1909, 6.9 in 1908, 10.97 in 1907, and 10.26 in 1906. In 21 of the adulterated milk samples the Public Health Committee, after considering the amount of adulteration and the circumstances of the sale, decided not to prosecute the vendor, so that the percentages of prosecutions was only 3.9, compared with 4 per cent. in 1909, 3.8 in 1908, and 5.9 in 1907. In 55 out of the 96 cases in which adulterations were detected proceedings were instituted against the vendor, compared with 44 in 1909, and 50 in 1908. The total amount received in penalties under the aDove Acts during the year amounted to £115 15s. 6d., and the costs to £38 15s. 6d., making a total of £154 iis. od., compared with £g2 5s. od. in 1909, and .£118 9s. 6d. in 1908. 21$ Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Table CI. shows the number of samples taken, the number adulterated, and the percentage of adulterated samples for the years 1900-1909, compared with the year 1910. As will be seen from the above Table the percentage of adulterated samples detected during the 10 years 1900-1909 was 9.17, compared with 9.05 in 1910, showing a decrease of .12 per cent., but an increase of 2.16 per cent. compared with 1909. Although the percentage of adulterated samples shows this large increase compared with 1909, it must not be concluded that the food supply of the Borough has deteriorated to that extent. Such an increase can be accounted for in several ways, but is mainly due to discrimination in the selection of, and the methods adopted in obtaining, the samples for analysis. The following Table shows the number of samples taken in each sub-district of the Borough, together with the number per 1,000 of population, and the number of adulterations detected and the percentage of adulterations.

Owing- to the number of peripatetic milk vendors residing outside the Borough, and who frequent chiefly the sub-district of Tooting, it was necessary to take a large proportion of samples in that sub-district during the year.

In all, 591 samples of milk and two of cream were taken. 44 of the samples of the milk and one of the cream, or 7.5 per cent. were found to be adulterated. Of the total 593, 540 were samples purchased by the Inspector, of which 40 or 7.4 per cent, were adulterated, while there were purchased by his deputy 53, of which five or 9.4 per cent. were adulterated. The one sample of cream which was found to be adulterated contained 20 grains of crystallised boric acid per pound. In this case proceedings were taken and a fine of 20s. was inflicted with 12 s. 6d. costs. 219 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 17 samples of milk were taken in course of delivery at the various Public Institutions in the Borough. Three samples were reported against as being adulterated. In two of the three cases the vendors were warned, and in the remaining case proceedings were taken against the vendor who, however, successfully proved a warranty. 28 samples of milk were taken at the various railway stations in the Borough, the milk being in course of delivery from the farmer to the retail vendor. On the whole this milk was exceptionally good, in most cases containing upwards of 4 per cent. of milk fat, and in no case was any adulteration detected. Nine samples of milk were taken on delivery at private houses, four of these being taken by the Inspector from the small can containing the early morning supply as it was being placed on the doorstep by the vendor. Three of the four taken in this way proved to be adulterated. In one case the Inspector had the vendor under observation for a considerable period, and arrangements were made to take a sample from him immediately after leaving his shop for the early morning round. The Inspector, who concealed himself in the immediate vicinity, saw the vendor leave his shop and serve several customers, leaving the milk in a small can on the doorstep. The Inspector then approached the vendor and demanded a sample from the can from which the customers had been served. This the vendor refused to sell, saying that he must mix it with the milk in his churn before sampling. The Inspector protested against this method, but the vendor insisted on mixing the milk. A sample taken from the milk when mixed proved an analysis to contain 4 per cent, of added water. At the same time a sample was taken from one of the small cans left on the doorstep, which proved on analysis to contain 35 per cent, of added water. Proceedings were taken against the vendor, who was convicted and fined £3 with £.2 6s. costs. 220 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In another case the vendor had flooded the district with handbills stating- that he could supply "Pure new milk" at 3d. per quart, of the same quality as was being supplied by local men at 4d. per quart. The vendor canvassed the district for custom, and once the customers were secured the fraud began by the substitution of skimmed milk for new milk. The Inspector had to watch his opportunity, and during the dark hours of early morning saw the vendor in the act of leaving some milk on the doorstep of one of his victims. He then went up quickly and, taking hold of the can, informed the vendor that the milk would be submitted for analysis by the Public Analyst. This sample proved to be deficient in milk fat to the extent of 31 per cent. Proceedings followed and the vendor was convicted and fined ^5 with £2 costs. The third case occurred on a Sunday morning, the Inspector having procured a sample for analysis, disclosed his identity, whereupon the vendor (knowing the milk was well watered) seized the jug and upset the contents, refusing to serve another sample. Proceedings were then taken for wilful obstruction and refusing to sell, and a fine of .£"10 and costs or one month's imprisonment being imposed, but the defendant having no money or goods went to prison for one month.

Private Houses 9 3 33 164 samples of milk and 10 of butter were procured during the early morning and mid-day of Sundays. Of these 15 samples of milk proved to be adulterated, a percentage of 9.1, compared with 2.6 in 1909, and 9 in 1908. 221 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 220 samples of milk were procured during the early morning' on week days and several samples were also taken from wholesale ffirms when delivering milk to retailers between the hours of 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. In five cases proceedings were taken against vendors for selling milk from receptacles on which their name and address was not conspicuously inscribed, and in each case a penalty was inflicted. In four cases proceedings were taken against vendors for wilful obstruction, and for refusing to sell, the penalties inflicted being £.2 and costs, £3 and costs, £2 and costs or 21 days imprisonment, £10 and costs or one month's imprisonment. In five cases summonses were dismissed owing to the defendant pleading the warranty clause. As I have repeatedly mentioned in my Reports this method of defence is a very serious drawback to the effective working of the Acts, and every effort should be made by those in authority to procure the abolition or amendment of this clause. The Inspector has on many occasions during the year reported that it is a most difficult matter to deal with the itinerant vendor of separated milk under the existing law, and while this defect continues the number of this class of vendor will tend to increase. They do not, however, all escape justice, for during the year no less than eight of this class of vendor were convicted, the fines ranging from £1 to £10 and costs, and in two cases the defendants were sent to prison. The following Table shows the number of milk vendors who are not actually ratepayers in this Borough, but who carry on trade in various parts of the Borough. The Table also shows the number of samples taken, the number adulterated, as well as the number and percentage of prosecutions. 222 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. It will be noticed that the percentage of prosecutions of those traders residing outside the Borough is almost double that of those residing within the Borough. TABLE CV.

Butter. 304 samples of butter were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, most of the samples having been purchased during the busy shopping hours in the evening. 22 samples were reported against as being either wholly margarine or a mixture of margarine and butter, and in each case proceedings were taken and penalties inflicted. Four of the samples of butter reported against as being margarine were taken by the Inspector as butter, being exposed for sale by retail. The following instance will show how the public can be defrauded. The Inspector, seeing that a block of butter exposed an a marble slab was composed of two distinct colours, asked the vendor for a sample. The vendor in serving the Inspector scooped out a piece from the top of the block. The Inspector refused to take this, and asked for a piece to be taken off containing the 223 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. two colours, and after some hesitation the vendor did as requested, placing the piece on the slab and chopping off the darker portion of the piece, which afterwards proved to be margarine. The Inspector, not being satisfied with the method adopted by the vendor, procured a sample by cutting off a slice, sufficient for analysis, which coutaiued the two substances, and this on analysis proved to be equal parts of butter and margarine. It was obvious that this substance was being sold as butter, and being so placed it was within the power of the vendor to manipulate the proportion of margarine and butter according to the customer. The defendant, who was ably defended, was convicted and fined £5 and costs. It is satisfactory to note that in no case during the year has any sample of butter been reported against owing to excess of moisture, or to the presence of a preservative. Cheese. Five samples of gorgonzola cheese were taken, and in four of them it was found that the rind contained a certain amount of barytes and tallow, varying from 15 to 25 per cent. The vendors in these cases were warned and no proceedings were taken. Lard. During the year a memorandum was received from the Local Government Board drawing attention to the sale of lard substitutes as lard. The memorandum stated that it is desirable to direct special attention to the sale of this article, on account of the increase which has lately taken place in the importation of lard substitutes into this country, and of the marked difference in the price of these substitutes compared with genuine lard. 224 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The memorandum pointed out that samples of lard substitutes have been found to contain as much as 24 per cent. of moisture, and that samples taken in the North of England were found to contain solid paraffin. I therefore instructed the Inspector to take samples of lard in various parts of the Borough. 12 samples were taken, but these all proved on analysis to be genuine lard. Groceries. In all 69 samples of various groceries were taken, and 10 or 14.5 per cent. were reported against. Five of these were tinned goods, two were cases of coffee, one of malt vinegar, and one of cocoa. In the case of the cocoa, which contained 33 per cent. of extraneous shell, the proceedings resulted in the vendor being convicted, and a fine of £1 was inflicted with 12s. 6d. costs. Cereals and Flour. As was stated in my last Annual Report this Council issued a circular letter to all grocers and others within the Borough calling their attention to the so-called "facing of rice," viz.: giving the rice a polished appearance by means of a mineral known as talc or steatite. It is satisfactory to report that the eight samples of rice taken in various parts of the Borough proved on analysis to be entirely free from "facing." In connection with the list of articles sampled under this heading it will be noticed that one rather unusual adulteration was detected, viz.: arrowroot containing 90 per cent. of tapioca flour. A comparison between the price paid for the sample of arrowroot, viz.: 1s. 6d. per pound, and that usually paid for tapioca, viz.: 3d. per pound, shows that a large profit is thereby obtained. 225 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Although adulterations are seldom reported under this heading it shows the necessity of occasional sampling. Meats. It will be seen from Table CIII. that a very high percentage of adulteration was detected under this heading, the adulteration consisting entirely of the addition of a boron preservative, in one case amounting to as much as 55 grains per pound of sausage. In five cases proceedings were taken against the vendors, and convictions obtained. It seems to be the general practice among certain sausage makers to use this boron preservative indiscriminately, and usually by means of a dredger. It is argued from a trade point of view that the addition of a small amount of preservative is absolutely imperative in the manufacture of sausages. Assuming this to be so then the purchaser should be notified of the addition, the amount added should also be stated. Drugs. 19 samples of drugs were taken during the year, and all proved genuine. Tinned Foods. Eight samples were taken and in six of these, or 75 per cent., it was reponed that there was present a small proportion of tin varying from .25 to .95 grains per pound. As the amount was small it was decided by the Public Health Committee not to take proceedings against the vendors. Q 226 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Although there has been a considerable increase in the amount of work, both clerical and otherwise, during the year, I am able to report that it has all been carried out by the staff in a most satisfactory manner. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX.
