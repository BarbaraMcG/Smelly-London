General Report of Works executed by THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1869-70. 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, June, 1870. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, In reviewing the works executed in my department during the last twelve months, but very little is required by way of explanation. With regard to the various lists appended to this short report, the majority of the matters having been done upon the authority of, and after consideration by the Works Committee, are therefore fresh in the recollection of the Vestry; and, as will be seen, hardly any new works have been attempted at all, though such a state of things cannot last very long, as it is evident that the whole of the Parish paving will, "wear out" at once if a reasonable proportion of new is not executed at least every year. The year has, upon the whole, been favourable for the maintenance of the paved surfaces, especially 14 the McAdamized portion of the Parish, as for several months, owing to continued dry weather, it has been unnecessary to spread much broken granite. This is not an unmixed advantage, as in the event of continued wet, a great quantity of materials might be found necessary to put the roadways in a thorough state of repair, but as this always has to be done in the autumn, a dry spring and summer is, as far as paving generally is concerned, advantageous. As there is nothing in the items to justify or require explanation with regard to paving matters, I would only add that a great deal wants doing, and that many of the footways, and those in the principal streets, cannot, in the nature of things, last much longer, and it must be borne in mind that some of the work was probably never very well done, even at the first, so that it is almost a matter of surprise that it wears as well as it does. It has been often explained, that the greater part of the work in paving matters consists in maintaining things as they are, as well as can be done; the number and list of small repairs, and incidental matters that are done in the course of twelve months would fill a moderate sized volume if made out in extenso, but as this would be but printing copies of the various books wherein all the matters are recorded, no possible benefit and but very trifling interest could accrue from such a publication. 15 The list appended also shews the matters, or rather the principal matters in connection with sewers works that have required and received the necessary attention during the past year. The items under the head of "Sewers Cleansed and Accumulations Removed," comprise principally, as has been often explained, those sewers that run from east to west in the Parish, the fall of which is very limited and inadequate; the Windmill Street Sewers, though having abundant fall, have other causes at work that give occasion for constant watchfulness and attention, and I am afraid will in course of time involve a considerable outlay. As these defects manifest themselves one by one, such steps are taken as are practicable to remedy the evils, but in many cases it is simply, to stave them off and not to cure effectually; however, nothing has as yet happened to justify the proposition of a large expenditure, and until there is a sufficient cause the wisest course is to maintain the sewers as well as can be done at the least expense. The causes that affect their efficiency are very uncertain in their action, and if sufficient watchfulness is maintained no apprehension need be felt of any sudden accident, but still I am afraid, sooner or later, extensive repairs will become peremptory. As I have before explained, rats are intimately connected with it. 16 In Cross Court, Carnaby Street, a work of some magnitude, the cost of which amounted to £113 8s. 10d. was rendered compulsory by the complete stoppage of some 12-in.pipes that had been substituted for the original sewer. It was decided, after due deliberation, to remove the pipes that had been laid in the invert, (which was not only an error of judgment, but the work itself was most unsatisfactorily executed, and in a manner almost certain to bring about the evil that it did), and to re-instate the sewer, which was in excellent condition, as originally built. In addition to remedying the actual defects a connexion was made with the West Street Sewer, not only to ensure access but to aid in the ventilation, a more important question. A portion of an extremely old and dilapidated sewer in Beak Street has likewise been rebuilt and the old drains connected; this work should have been done years since; fortunately no disaster has occurred in consequence of the delay, but the risk is very great in underground matters, when as in this instance, no access can be obtained to the sewer, and consequently nothing definite can be ascertained or acted upon. The Regent Street Sewers only appear in one item, and that was caused more by alteration to the house drain than by any immediate necessity; advantage was taken of an 17 opening being made into the sewer for an alteration, or rather the reconstruction of a drain, to cleanse the sewer as far as could be fairly done by means of that opening, although nothing more was attempted than that I have just stated, still I am bound to say that there was a considerable accumulation in that portion of the sewer which ought to be removed, and the sewer itself was, in common with the greater part of the tributary sewers there, any thing but what it should be, so that it is merely a question of time as to when the next cleansing and repair will become imperative; this will probably immediately follow some violent storm. A small amount appeal's against No. 112, Jernyn Street; this, however, is only preliminary as the amount actually expended exceeds considerably that sum. From the defective connexion of some house drains a great quantity of gravel and soil found its way into the sewer under the active exertions of the indefatigable rat, so much so as to leave a large cavity under the roadway sufficient to require several loads of rubbish to fill it in, and which must sooner or later have caused a subsidence on the surface, and as this would of necessity have been immediately caused by a heavily loaded wagon or omnibus, or both, very serious consequence would appear to have been inevitable. All was, however, made good, not without trouble and some exercise b 18 of judgment, and the whole is made solid and secure. Advantage was taken of the circumstance to see that everything connected with the houses, drains, vaults, &c., were put in a complete state of repair. The usual periodical flushing was done in the autumn for the purpose of testing and cleansing the pipe sewers, which are, and always must be a source of constant expense and trouble; though all sewers are of necessity some trouble and cost. Small pipe sewers are greatly in excess of larger and differently constructed sewers, and are at times very uncertain in their action, as from the nature of their construction there is a greater possibility of bad workmanship than in those positions where inspection after completion is practicable. I am sorry to have again to report that in the matter of public urinals and conveniences nothing has been done in the way of increase in number or size. Such as the Vestry have have been maintained and kept in repair but nothing beyond that has been attempted. The Vestry having provided a sum of money for the construction of an underground urinal, I am rather sanguine that by this time next year I shall have the pleasure of reporting the completion of a structure that will be a real public convenience and a credit to the Parish, and example to be largely followed. 19 The list also shews the various small matters that have been done in regard to alterations in lamps, new street names, repairing stand posts, and other small matters that do not need any special explanation. A great number of street names still require to be affixed; many of the present ones, though not actually illegible, are anything but creditable, and as a matter of appearance require to be replaced, though this work cannot be said to be actually essential. In conclusion I would add that all matters in the Surveyor's Department being so thoroughly weighed by the Works Committee and the Vestry, further explanations would be superfluous. I have the honour to be, Rev. Sir, my Lords and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, A. P. HOWELL.

JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, FOR THE YEAR 1870, BY EDWIN LANKESTER, M.D. LL.D. E.R.S. Ac. &c. MEDICAL OFFICER Of HEALTH FOR S.T. JAMBS's, WESTMINSTER. B 2 TO THE VESTRY OF The Parish of St. Jsmes's, Westminster. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, In laying before you for the fourteenth time the tables of the annual mortality in your parish in the year 1869, I beg to append a few remarks on some of the features of the disease and death of the parish in that year, as well as the sanitary work done. General Mortality in 1869. The death rate for the year 1868 was lower than any other year for the last fifteen years. In 1869 there has been a slight increase. The total deaths recorded in the bills of mortality for 1869 was 789. It will be however recollected that on account of the union of the Parish of St. Anne's for poor relief purposes, I pointed out last year that this had considerably increased the mortality in the workhouse 28 of Saint James, Westminster. I bad on that account to deduct from the mortality of Saint James, Westminster, the deaths of fifteen persons who had died in the parish workhouse. This year I find that forty-three persons have died in the workhouse who had come from the Parish of Saint Anne's, so that the death of the inhabitants of Saint James was really 746. The average death rate of the parish for the last twenty years is 741. The death therefore, of the last year, is slightly above the average. With regard to the mortality in the workhouse, I thought it my duty in the month of February, 1869, to call attention to an increase in the mortality of the workhouse. The following document, published at the time by the Vestry, will explain what took place. St. James's Westminster, At a vestry- 17th FEBRUARY, 1870. Present—"W. BTJ11T, Esq., Churchwarden. Ac. &c. &c. Mr. Bonthron, as Chairman of the Board of Guardians of the "Westminster Union, after adverting to an extract from the Report of the Medical Officer of Health read at the last Vestry, with reference to the increase of deaths in the Workhouse in Poland Street, viz.:— "The deaths in the Workhouse are gradually increasiug. They were 126 in the year 1807, 145 in the year 1868, and 183 in the year 1869. It is for the Board of Guardians to inquire into this matter. 29 and to ascertain whether the increase has arisen from an increase of inmates, and if so, whether overcrowding and deficient ventilation of the Wards may not have been the real cause of this increased mortality." produced and read the following Workhouse Statistics in explanation of the sublect:— The junction of St. Anne's, with its population of 17,426, to St. James's, with its population of 35,320, took place in 1807, forming what is now the WESTMINSTER UNION. During the year 1868, only a portion of the poor of St. Anne were domiciled in the Union Workhouse. In the year 1869 the whole of the. Poor of that Farisli were brought into the Workhouse.

Upon the Motion of Mr. Eiam, seconded by Mr. Downes, it •was resolved that the Statement produced by Mr. Bonthbon be printed, and a copy sent to each Member of the Yestry. Extracted from the Minutes, GEORGE BUZZARD, Vestry Clerk, Since the publication of this document, I have more fully examined the mortality in the workhouse, and find that the average death from 1863 to 1867, inclusive, was 134. The mortality of 1867 was therefore an exceptionally small mortality, whilst the two years 1868 and 1869 had their mortality increased by the inhabitants of Saint Anne's. Deducting these deaths, it gives for the inhabitants of 31 Saint James, Westminster, a mortality in the workhouse of 130 in 1888, and 140 in 1869. I may add that I recently inspected the workhouse, and, whilst I found everything scrupulously clean, I found some of the wards so constructed as to render ventilation deficient, and other wards with so many patients as to render it desirable that they should as soon as possible be diminished. Death Rate of the Parish. The mortality of 740 in a population of 35,326, gives a death-rate of 20'50 in the thousand. This must be regarded as a very favourable rate contrasted with the whole of the metropolis, and of particular districts of London. The mortality of London was, according to the Registrar-General's returns, 24.66 in the thousand, so that in spite of some disadvantages, Saint James, Westminster, may be regarded as a healthy locality. This deathrate is however largely increased by the fact that our birth-rate is high ; thus, in 1870 the births in the parish amounted to 884 shewing that the birthrate is much higher than the death-rate. Although there can be no doubt that the number of deaths in a parish does indicate really the amount of death in the parish, there may be various circumstances in the population of a parish which influence this death-rate, and the birth of children is one, for we 32 find as a matter of fact, that when a larger number of children are born, there the mortality is always highest, arising from the fact that the death amongst a number of children is always greater than amongst young persons or adults. Again, the deaths amongst very old people is much greater than amongst the young and the adult, hence a population of old people ought to be expected to die more rapidly than those of younger people. As this subject is one of great importance in estimating the value of weekly and annual returns of mortality, I subjoin here some remarks recently made by the Registrar-General on the significance of rates of mortality. Significance of eates of Mobtality. The rates of mortality published in the Weekly Beturns having been misunderstood in some quarters, it may be useful once more to explain what the general death rates of a population imply. The rate of mortality differs in a generation as it passes through different ages. It is in infancy very high, in boyhood very low through manhood it increases, and as men descend into the vale of years is rapidly accelerated by the wearing away of vital force. The mean rate in England has been for some years 22 annual deaths to 1000 living of all ages. The rate for males is 183 in 1000 in the Jirst year of life ; only 18 in the fifth 6 in the tenth, 5 in the sixteenth, 8 in the twenty-first year of life; 13 in the forty-first year, 19 in the fifty-first year; 33 in the sixty-first, 70 in the seventy-first, 153 in the eighty-first year, 307 in the ninety-first year of life. Infants and boys under 4 33 years of age cxpericnce a mortality above the average rate, and so do men of the age of 5 4 and upwards while boys and men of 5 years of age and below 54, die at less than the average rate. In the country, in cities, under tlie same sanitary conditions this universal law prevails; infants and old people die off more rapidly; boys and girls as well as men and women in the prime of life, less rapidly than the average rates imply. The general rates of mortality, as they are usually given, may differ therefore in two populations, merely because the ono contains more of the population under 5 and above 55 than the other. When the births exceed the deaths, the effect is to increase the number of children under 5 years of age ; and it is conceivable that a novice in these inquiries may rush to the conclusion, that the effect of an excess of births is to increase the general rate of mortality ; whereas it is found by observation to have the contrary effect. The mortality of a population with an excess of births over deaths is lower than the mortality of a stationary population where the births and deaths are equal. And the reason on reflection is obvious. The births take place steadily year by year in a city ; and if they are in excess of the deaths, they throw into it not only additional children under 5 years of age, but also children and adults above that age; and hence there is less than the due proportion of old people in the whole population; hence also the mortality appears below what it would be in the same population, under the same sanitary conditions, if the births and deaths were equal. In all England the births are to the deaths as 3 to 2; and this has the effect of reducing the rate of mortality to 22 in 1000. By the English Life Table, in which the people of different ages are distributed as they would be if the births and deaths were constantly equal, the correct rate is found to be 24 in 1000. In Liverpool when the rate of mortality was 34, the corrected rate was 39 ; in the same year the rate for London was 24, the corrected rate 27. Immigration has the effect of reducing the general rate of mortality; as it swells the excess of persons at ages of low mortality. C 34 The rates of mortality as they are generally cited, when the population is accurately determined, are for all the cities in the weekly tables below the true rates ; and when the differences in the rate in two cities are great, it is certain that this cannot be explained by any difference of the ages of the two population. A sustained rate of mortality above 17 in 1000 always implies unfavourable sanitary conditions : the London rate of 24 is moderately good ; any rate above 30 implies sanitary conditions highly destructive to human life. And when any city experiences a higher rate than the average it should always be a matter of serious inquiry and concern to its citizens. As to the significance of weekly rates of mortality the following propositions may be laid down : 1. These rates calculated in the usual way express facts; and higher rates than usual in a town show that from some cause or other, the deaths are frequent, and vice versa. 2. These rates are below the true rates in all the towns of the United Kingdom, in consequence of the great excess of * births over deaths; which has the effect of increasing the proportion of the population living at ages when the mortality is below the average. 3. The' excess of immigration over emigration operates in the same direction. 4. An excess of females in a town reduces its general rate of mortality. 5. There is an influx of patients into Hospitals in towns, but this is probably more than counterbalanced by the retirement of consumptive immigrants into the counties of their birth to die. 6. A sudden and large addition of births in a single year would have the effect of slightly raising the general mortality in that year; but the supposition of such an addition in English cities is baseless: the law here is a 35 constant excess of births over deaths, which keeps up a constant excess of young and middle-aged lives. 7. A Life Table constructed in the usual way shows the true average rate of mortality, and the mean duration of life; the two facts being indissolubly connected. The correct mortality of our worst cities was 1 in 25, in our healthiest districts it was 1 in 50 ; the duration of life was 25 and 50 years under the same circumstances. 8. A comparison of the true rates with the rates calculated in the usual way will show that the latter rates exhibit the relative fatality of different cities with sufficient accuracy for all ordinary purposes. They have no fallacious meaning. 9. Instead of reducing the death-rate of towns, on the ground that their birth-rate is high, the reverse should be done to get the corrected death-rate. 10. The true death-rate in all England lies between the death-rate and the birth-rate calculated in the usual way; a sixth of the difference added to the death rate is nearly its proper correction. 11. The causes of the differences of the rates of mortality are various, and in every case demand careful investigation on the spot by the town authorities. Mortality of different Districts of the Parish. I have often pointed out the great dillerence in the mortality of the different districts in the parish, and perhaps they have never been more decided than during the present year, as will be seen by the following table :— 36  First Quarter. Second Quarter. Third Quarter. Fourth Quarter. Population. St. James's Sq. Div. 38 27 28 27 10,753 Golden Square Div. 67 69 44 68 13,963 Berwick Street Div. 65 49 61 67 10,608 Workhouse 50 62 32 36 • • 220 207 164 198 35,324 It will be at once seen how different is the mortality in the three divisions in the parish. Whilst the people die at the low rate of only 11 in the 1000 in St. James's Square Division, they die at the rate of 18 in 1000 in Golden Square, and 22 in the 1000 in the Berwick Street Division. These calculations do not, however, include the Workhouse, vvhich includes in its population a far larger number of persons who have resided in Berwick Street, than either in the Golden Square or St. James's Square Division. This would raise the Berwick Street mortality probably as high as 25 in the 1000, shewing that in the midst of the parish we have a population less healthy than that of the mass of the population of London. If we turn to the table of causes of death we shall find that in the principal causes of the increased mortality of the Berwick Street District, is the prevalence of Zymotic diseases. These diseases spread more easily in overcrowed populations, and 37 it is precisely in the Berwick Street District, that there is an overcrowding of the population. I have often drawn attention to this drawback in the health of Berwick Street and its neighbourhood, and every effort should be made, not only to reduce the number of houses, but also to diminish the population of each house.

And again, as I have said before, the cases taken into the Workhouse are more largely imported from Berwick Street than either St. James's or Golden Square Districts. Whatever may be the cause of the overcrowding in the Berwick Street there can be no doubt of its disastrous effects on the life and health of the district. The class of persons who suffer from these diseases can easily be determined by the tables. Of the 119 cases of Zymotic Disease only 13 occurred in persons above five years of age, and of those only three were above twenty years of age. I ought, however, to state here that a certain number of adults are removed from the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, to the London Fever Hospital in Islington. When they die there the death is registered in the Parish of Islington, 39 This is the reason that Small Pox does not appear in the tables of mortality, from Zymotic Diseases, for although we have had this disease prevailing to a considerable extent, the fatal cases have occurred at the Small Pox Hospital, which is also situated in the Parish of Islington, where the deaths are registered. Hooping Cough. Of the individual diseases of which the Zymotic group is composed, Hooping Cough is answerable for the largest amount of mortality. There is no question about the communicability of this disease, and the power which a properly instructed community has in counteracting its presence and fatal effects. As long, however, as people consider it a necessary evil, and with no precautions to prevent it, Hooping Cough will spread from child to child, and annually present its victims on that altar of Moloch which our carelessness and ignorance have erected. Scarlet Fever. The next fatal disease on our list is Scarlet Fever. It killed 39 children in our Parish during the last year, and laid on beds of sickness at least 40 400 more. Where it occurs it is easily prevented spreading, and the only necessity is the carrying out certain acknowledged principles of action. With a view to instructing the public on this subject, I requested that I might be allowed to circulate the following directions in the Parish:— On the Nature of Scaelet Feyee, and the Best Means of Preventing it. Scarlet Fever is a highly contagious disease, and spreads from one person to another, and is thus propagated in families, towns, and districts. It is therefore, highly desirable that every one should understand the nature of this disease, and the means of preventing its spreading. It is always attended with a scarlet eruption on the skin, and is mostly accompanied by a sore throat. Whenever children have sore throats, or an eruption on the skin, they should be separated from the rest of the family until a doctor has seen them, or these symptoms have disappeared. There is every reason to believe that, during the progress of this disease, not only the eruption of the skin, but everything that is thrown off from the body of the infected person is heavily laden with the germs or seeds which are capable of propagating the disease in another person. The discharges from the nose and throat are especially virulent. There is also reason to believe that the discharges from the bowls are the same. The kidneys are frequently dangerously diseased in Scarlet Fever, and the secretion from these organs is also probably highly contagious; the power of spreading the poison by means of these secretions is not confined to their immediately leaving the body, but continues long after. It is on this account that when theso secretions have found their way to the cesspool and sewer, they may still give off poison to the surrounding air, and 41 persons breathing it may become infected. Taking these things into consideration, it will be seen that it is nccessary, if possible, to destroy and annihilate this poison before it leaves the room where the person is whose body has produced it. The following directions, drawn up by Dr. W. Budd, should in all eases bo carried into effect:— 1. The room should be cleared of all needless woollen or other draperies which might possibly serve to harbour the poison. 2. A basin, charged with chloride or carbolate of lime, or some other convenient disinfectant, should be kept constantly on the bed for the patient to spit into. 3. A large vessel, containing water, impregnated with chlorides, or with Condy's fluid, should always stand in the room for the reception of all bed and body-linen immediately on its removel from the person of the patient. 4. Pocket-handkerchiefs should not be used, and small pieces of rag employed instead for wiping the mouth and nose. Each piece, after being once used, should be immediately burnt. 5. As the hands of nurses of necessity become frequently soiled by the secretions, a good supply of towels and two basins—one containing water with Condy's fluid or chlorides, and another plain soap and water, should be always at hand for the immediate removal of the taint. 0. All glasses, cups, or other vessels, used by or about the patient, should be scrupulously cleaned before being used by others. 7. The discharges from the bowels and kidneys should be received on their very issue from the body into vessels charged with disinfectants. By these measures the greater part of the germs which are thrown off by internal surfaces may be robbed of their power to propagate the disease. The poisonous germs that are thrown oft from the skin 42 require a somewhat different treatment. The plan recommended by Dr. Budd for the purpose of preventing the poison from the skin being disseminated through the air, is to put oil all over the skin. This practice is to commence on the fourth day after the appearance of the eruption, and to be continued every day until the patient is well enough to take a warm bath, in which the whole person is well washed with disinfecting soap and warm water. These baths should be administered every other day, for four times, when the disinfection of the skin may be regarded as complete. This proceeding should not, however, be adopted "without consulting the medical man who is in attendance on the patient. Speaking of the plans above recommended, Dr. Budd says, "The success of this method in my own hands has been very remarkable. For a period of nearly 20 years, during which I have employed it in a very wide field, I have never known the disease spread in a single instance beyond the sick room, and in very few instances within it. Time after time I have treated this fever in houses crowded from attic to basement with children and others, who have, nevertheless, escaped infection. The two elements in the method are, separation on the one hand, and disinfection on the other." The distribution of this placard has, I believe, been attended with most beneficial results. It was reprinted in many of the newspapers and. during the epidemic of Scarlet Fever, was, I understand, circulated in Nottingham, Leeds, and other towns in the kingdom, with most beneficial results. Typhoid Fever. Under the head of "Typhus," a certain number of cases of death are annually recorded in the Parish. Although in our overcrowded Parish, of which Typhus 43 is the result, we have little or no true Typhus Fever. What we are subject to is Typhoid Fever, which is essentially connected with bad drainage. Active as your Sanitary Inspector has been in detecting imperfect drainage in the Parish, we are always subject to isolated cases of this disease, and ten deaths under the head of "Typhus" are due to Typhoid Fever. As this disease is one thoroughly under human agency, I requested the Vestry to allow me to circulate the following directions for its management when it has broken out. On the Nature of Typhoid or Drain Feveb, and the best means of preventing it. This Fever is called Drain Fever, from its constant association with bad and imperfect drainage in houses. It is called Gastric Fever from its chief seat being in the Stomach and Bowels. At one time it was confounded with Typhus Fever, but differs from that disease in many respects; hence it is called Typhoid Fever. It is also called Low Fever, from the great exhaustion and weakness which attends it. It is a highly contagious Fever. The means by which this disease may be prevented from spreading are very simple, and depends upon the fact, that the poison by which it spreads is almost entirely contained in the discharges from the bowels. Dr. W. Budd gives the following excellent directions for preventing the spread of this disease. He says the discharges from the bowels infect— 1. The air of the sick room. 2. The bed and body linen of the patient. 3. The privy and the cesspool, or the drains proceeding from them. 44 From the privy or the drain, the poison often soaks into the well, and infects the drinking water. This last, when it happens, is of all forms of fever poisoning the most deadly. In these various ways, the infection proceeding from the bowel-discharges often spreads the fever far and wide. The one great thing to aim at, therefore, is to disinfect these discharges on their very escape from the body, and before they are carried from the sick room. This may be perfectly done by the use of disinfectants. One of the best is made of green copperas. This substance, which is used by all shoemakers, is very cheap, and may be had everywhere. A pound and a half of green copperas to a gallon of water is the proper strength. A teacupful of this liquid, put into the night-pan every time before it is used by the patient, renders the bowel-discharge perfectly harmless. To disinfect the bed and body-linen, and bedding generally, chloride of lime or Mac Dougall's powder is more convenient. These powders should be sprinkled by means of a common dredger, on soiled spots on the linen and about the room to purify the air. All articles of bed and body linen should be plunged, immediately on their removal from the bed, into a bucket of water containing a tablespoonful of chloride of lime or MacDougall's powder, and should be boiled before being washed. The privy, or closet, and all drains commucating with it, should be flushed twice daily with the green copperas liquid or carbolic acid, diluted with water. In the event of death, the body should be placed, the body should be possible, in a coffin surrounded with charcoal, sprinkled with disinfectants. Early burial is on all accounts, desirable, In towns and villages where the fever is already prevalent, the last rule should be put in force for all houses, whether there be fever in them or not, and for all public drains. As the hands of those attending on the sick often become unavoidably soiled by the discharges from the bowels, they should be frequently washed. The sick-room should be kept well ventilated, day and night. The greatest possible care should be taken with regard to the drinking water. Where there is the slightest risk of its having become tainted with fever-poison, water should be got from a pure source, should or 45 at least be boiled before being drunk. Immediately after the illness is over, whether ending in death or recovery, the dresses worn by the nurses should be washed or destroyed, and the bed and room occupied by the sick should be thoroughly disinfected. These are golden rules. Where they are neglected, the fever may become a deadly scourge. Where they are strictly carried out, it seldom spreads beyond the person first attacked. A yard of thin wide-width gutta percha placed under the blanket, under the breech of the patient, by effectually preventing the discharges from soaking into the bed, is a great additional safeguard. Medical men and others are invited to report any case of Typhoid Fever at the Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, in order that the Sanitary Inspector may inspect the drains and see to the general sanitary condition of the house in which the fever occurs. These directions have also been reprinted in other Parishes, and have I believe, been the means of checking the spread of this disease in many localities. The importance of preventing the spread of Typhoid Fever will be appreciated by the fact that it does not attack children so often as the elder branches of families—the fathers and mothers, the breadwinners and supporters of families. Small Pox. Although no death has been recorded this year from this disease, yet circumstances have especially drawn attention to the occurrence of Small Pox amongst us, and the means for its prevention. On July 22nd I reported to the Fortnightly Meeting of the Vestry as follows:— 46 I attended an inquest on July 10th, on the body of a child who died after vaccination. It appeared that the child had been vaccinated by Dr. Allen, of Soho Square. It was taken by the mother to Dr. Allen's surgery, and then vaccinated from another child. The next day a swelling came on in the arm in the places which had been punctured, but there was no evidence that the Cow Pox had been communicated to the child. The surgeon, Mr. J. F. Clark, who attended the deceased at its death, gave it as his opinion that the child had died of Erysipelas, not from the introduction of vaccine matter into the arm, but from the punctures produced by the lancet. The jury returned a verdict of "Death from Natural Causes." At the inquest there was present the father of a child who had been also vaccinated by Dr. Allen, and who had died after the operation. As this child had died in my Coroner's district I have since held an inquest on the body. This child was also vaccinated from another child in Dr. Allen's surgery. In this case the arm went through all stages of the Cow Pox disease successfully, but on the ninth day after vaccination Erysipelas came on, and he died under Dr. Allen's care five weeks after he was vaccinated. A post mortem examination was made by Mr. Harding, who gave his opinion at the inquest that the child had died of Erysipelas brought 47 on by the Cow Pox. Although the child appeared healthy there can be no doubt in this case that it was predisposed to Erysipelas, and might have sunk from the same cause by any other disease. The causes of death from vaccination are exceedingly rare, and are so insignificant, as compared with the enormous amount of life saved by its effect on the system, that any opposition to its use must be regarded in all civilised communities as a punishable offence. Nor are its effects on the system in any way injurious. There is no proof whatever that any other disease can be communicated at the same time with the Cow Pox. In the case of the last child several children were vaccinated from it two days before the Erysipelas broke out, but in no instance did any of the children suffer from Erysipelas. As these cases were seized on by those who profess to believe that vaccination is of no benefit to the community, I requested the Vestry to allow me to draw up a statement for circulation in reference to the facts and reasons which had induced the Legislation to pass Acts for the Compulsory Vaccination of Children. Facts and Reasons in Favour of Vaccination and the Vaccination Laws. I.—Persons who have once had the Small Pox are not liable to take it a second time. In the last century Inoculation of 48 Small Pox was practised, because it was known that Small Pox thus communicated was usually milder than when caught naturally. II.—Cow Pox is a modified form of Small Pox, and it has been clearly proved that those who have had it are very much less liable to take Small Pox than arc others: and are as effectually protected as those who have already had Small Pox. III.—Cow Pox is communicated by Vaccination. Jenner discovered that persons who had caught Cow Pox from the cow escaped Small Pox, and thus was led to advise Vaccination. IV.—Forty-five millions of the people of Europe died from Small Pox in the hundred years preceding the introduction of Vaccination at the beginning of this century ; whilst not more than two millions have died from this disease during the seventy years in which Vaccination has been practised. In London before the introduction of Vaccination every tenth death that occurred was due to Small Pox, now only one death in every eighty-five is due to this disease. Even greater difference has been observed in other towns and cities of Europe, as in Trieste where the deaths from Small Pox have been seventyfive times less since than before Vaccination; in Moravia twenty-one times less; in Silesia twenty-nine times less, in Westphalia twenty-five times less; and in Berlin nineteen times less. Where Vaccination has been stringently enforced, death from Small Pox has been still more diminished. In Ireland where this disease was once a scourge it has now become almost unknown, and the same good result has been obtained in many districts in India. "When Small Pox has been rife among the inhabitants of a city or district, it has been repeatedly observed that the unvaccinated have perished, and the vaccinated survived or altogether escaped. Very carefully kept records in hundreds of places in Europe and elsewhere have proved this. Out of thirty vaccinated nurses constantly employed at the Small Pox Hospital, not one ever contracted the Small Pox ; of the patients admitted to this hospital, from 49 1836 to 1851, thirty-seven in the hundred of those unvaccinated died, whilst only six in the hundred who had been vaccinated (well or badly) died. V.—In England there is a larger proportion of unvaccinated persons than in any other country of Europe, and consequently a greater number of deaths from Small Pox are shewn hj the public registration, to occur. VI.—Whilst Small Pox kills so great a proportion of the unvaccinated whom it attacks, the inoculation of Cow Pox, i.e., Vaccination seldom or ever produces any consequences of an injurious nature. The authenticated fatal eases ef Erysipelas so produced are not more numerous than those that follow the prick of a pin. There is no proof that those who have been vaccinated suffer from Scrofula or any similar disease as a consequence of Vaccination alone. According to the EegistrarGeneral's returns these diseases have diminished in frequency since the introduction of Vaccination. That which follows after a thing is not necessarily caused by it. It is a matter of necessity that persons who have been vaccinated, should have diseases after this operation as well as before it, but these cannot rightly be attributed to Vaccination. VII.—The laws of our country demand that every one should be vaccinated, because persons who arc unvaccinated are liable to take Small Pox and die. The law does not allow the right of a man to catch Small Pox or to expose his children to it, as it does not allow him to kill himself or his children. It has been recently made unlawful for a man to accumulate dirt and filth which may become the means of spreading disease and death among his neighbours, and similarly the law does not allow a man to make his body, or those of his children, hotbeds for the development of the deadly Small Pox, which may spread to his neighbours. VIII.—Although very rarely the eruptions of other diseases have through the carelessness of medical practitioners, been mistaken for Cow Pox, yet it would be as reasonable to ask for D 50 the abolition of railways because of railway accidents, as to demand the abolition of Yaccination on account of such accidental occurrences. IX. —The great means whereby Small Pox may be wholly exterminated is universal Yaccination. X.—Small Pox is one of the greatest curses to man, whilst Yaccination is one of his greatest blessings. I am glad to inform you that this resume immediately excited the most violent opposition amongst those who are opposed to vaccination; and its statements have been diffused throughout the length and breadth of the land. In the Parish of Saint Pancras one gentleman had 10,000 copies struck off for private circulation. In various parts of the country the document has been re-published with, I understand, most beneficial results. Legislation on Zymotic Diseases. The fact that Catching Diseases are extensively propagated by the ignorance and carelessness of the community has attracted the attention of the Legislature, and although the usual method of allowing the public authorities to let their fellow-creatures be killed or not, has usually been followed; in our recent sanitary legislation it will perhaps surprise some persons in the community to know that, to a certain extent, 51 power to prevent the wilful or careless spread of Catching Diseases has really been put in the hands of the Magistrates. At your request, I have embodied those clauses of the Sanitary Act of 1866 which bear on this question. On Infectious or Catching Diseases, and the Legal Means of Preventing their Spreading. 1.—Catching or Infectious Diseases are Scarlet Fever, Small Pox, Typhus, Typhoid, and Relapsing Fevers, and Measles. 2.—By the Sanitary Act of 1866, a Penalty of £5 is inflicted on any person who wilfully or negligently is the means of spreading Infeetious and Contagious Diseases among their friends or neighbours. 3.—It is Illegal to use any public Cab for the conveyance of a Patient to a Hospital or anywhere else without telling the driver that it is a case of Infectious Disease. 4.—The driver of a Cab may refuse to take any such Person unless he is paid a sum of money sufficient to defray the expenses of disinfecting his Cab. 5.—Any Cabman taking another fare, after conveying an infected Person, without previously disinfecting his Cab, is liable to a Penalty of £5. 6.—It is Illegal for an Infected Person to go, or for any person to take or send any one suffering from an Infectious Disease, to any public place, such as the Waiting Room of a Hospital or Dispensary, or to a School, or a Church or a Chapel, or a Theatre, or Omnibus or other Public Carriage, so as to endanger any other persons, whether adults or children. 52 7.—It is also illegal for any Person to give, lend, or sell, or move to another place, or expose, any bedding, clothing, rags, or other things, which may have become infected, and are liable to convey any contagious diseases to another person, unless such things have been previously disinfected. 8.—It is also illegal to let any house, room, or part of a house, in which any person has been ill with any dangerous [nfcctious Disease, until it and all articles in it have been properly disinfected. The same law also applies to Public Houses, Hotels, and Lodging Houses. The Penalty for disobedience in these cases is £20. 9.—When Persons have had Infectious Diseases, whether they get well or die, the Room in which they have been ill should be disinfected. The floor should be washed with chloride of lime and water, or carbolic acid and water. The Paper should be removed by moistening with carbolic acid and water, or with Condy's Fluid and water. The Room should then be fumigated by burning sulphur in an iron dish, the fireplace, crevices in windows and doors being closed by putting paper over them, The Room should be exposed to the sulphur vapour for five or six hours. Or, the Room may be fumigated in the same way with chlorine vapour, which is procured by pouring oil of vitriol on common salt and oxide of manganese. 10.—After the Room has been fumigated it should be limewhited, and the doors and windows kept open for a week or a fortnight. 11.—The means for conveying Persons to the Fever Hospital or Small Pox Hospital, can be ascertained by applying at the "Workhouse, in Poland Street, or at the Yestry Hall, Piccadilly. The great deficiency of the Act of 1866, as of all other English legislation on sanitary matters, is that no public prosecutor is appointed. If Vestries 53 neglect to prosecute, and individuals do not see their way to do it, people may be killed by infectious diseases to any extent. Ignorance the Source of Death and Disease from Preventible causes, Whilst it is very evident that much may be done by removing the more obvious causes of death and disease among a community, there is one thing that is always preventing the good that may be effected, and that is the entire ignorance of the population of the nature of the laws of life. What is done for them one day is undone the next by their want of appreciating the benefits of sanitary action. In some of the courts and small streets of this parish, it is not only necessary that nuisances dangerous to health should be removed, but that attention should be given by the Sanitary Inspectors from day to day, to see that sanitary conditions are kept up. In some of your courts, the decencies of existence could not be maintained without almost a daily supervision. The water-closet that is cleaned and put to rights one day is fouled and out of order the next. The ventilators that are put up one week are blocked up the next. The windows that are made to open to let out foul air and let in fresh. 54 are never opened at all. Beds and linen that are once washed and cleansed are allowed to become dirty and not cleaned for months till the Sanitary Inspector calls again. The drains that are repaired and cleansed are not again thought of till disease or death brings inspection, and reveals the fact of negligence alike on the part of landlord and tenant, these things are not alone observed among the poor. Occasionally disease occurs with unprecedented severity amongst the more opulent. It is then found that they too have neglected the most obvious means of obtaining health and life. The fact is, poor and rich are alike ignorant of the laws which govern the life of their households. The legislator and the poor artisan, and the classes that exist between them, are all untaught with regard to the great facts of their physical existence. They have all been more or less educated, but whether that education has been received in our wealthily endowed universities, our high or middle-class schools, our National, or British and Foreign schools, they have all failed to be taught the elements of that knowledge by which disease and death may be prevented. The cost of the preventible diseases and death of the population in Great Britain cannot be estimated at less than ten millions of pounds annually, a loss that cannot be represented by a capital of less than 55 200,000,000 of pounds. It is on this ground that during the past year I urged on the Social Science Congress at Bristol the necessity of introducing into every school the teaching of the elements of physiology in every school alike.* It is in vain that the legislature enact sanitary laws; it is in vain that local bodies are entrusted with power to carry into effect sanitary legislation, unless their efforts are met with something like intelligent appreciation by the community. It is not wise to leave this important subject to the taste and choice of people as they grow up. Children of all classes are too busily engaged directly they leave school ever to acquire any systematic or real knowledge of the nature of the structure of their body and its functions. It is while they are at school that this knowledge should be especially given to girls. It is the woman who presides over the household. If she is ignorant of the poisonous nature of dirt, of the unwholesome influence of impure air, of the nature of wholesome food, her family becomes the prey of infectious and other fatal diseases; and if early death does not carry them off, they lead lives of immorality and licentiousness, and know nothing of the blessings of a healthy physical or moral existence. I must now, however leave this question of the *"What shall we teach, or Physiology in Schools." Groomhridge and Sons. Price 1s. 56 education of the people in the laws of health to the members of the Vestry. In the course of another year, many of them will be placed on Local Boards, where they will have a voice in sanctioning what shall be taught in our New National Schools; and, above all things I would implore them, that before every other secular subject, they should demand that a part of the time of teaching should be given to instruction in a knowledge of the structure and functions of the human body. Of .this, above all other subjects that may be taught in our schools, it may be most appropriately said— "Ignorance is the curse of God, Knowledge is the wings, whereby we fly to heaven I have the honor to be, Rev.
