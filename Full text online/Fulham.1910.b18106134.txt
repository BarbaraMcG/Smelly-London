To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the vital statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the borough for the year 1910. The statistics of births, deaths and infectious diseases relate to the fifty-two weeks ended December 31st, 1910. POPULATION. The population of the Borough in the middle of 1910, as estimated by the Registrar-General on the assumption that the rate of increase which prevailed between 1896 and 1901 has been maintained since, was 181,282. Estimated on the number of rated houses, and assuming the same number to a house as at the Census, the population was 158,307, and on this figure the statistics in this report are based, though as at the present time there are, especially in Sands End Ward, many empty tenements, which, owing to the compounding system, are not shown in the rate-books, it is not improbable that even this may be too high an estimate, though not sufficiently so to seriously affect the accuracy of the mortality rates. 6 The following table shows the increase of the Borough in the last sixty years:— TABLE I.

The number of marriages registered during the year was 1,273, compared with 1,308, 1,205 and 1,182 in the three preceding years. The marriage-rate—i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 inhabitants—was 16.1, the average rate for the previous ten years being 15.9. 7 TABLE II.

Note.—The deaths included in Column 7 of this table are the whole of those registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. The deaths included in Column 12 are the number in Column 7, corrected by the subtraction of the number in Column 10 and the addition of the number in Column 11. By the term "Non-residents" is meant persons brought into the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and dying in public institutions there; and by the term "Residents" is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and have died in public institutions elsewhere. The Public Institutions taken into account for the purpose of these tables are those into which persons are habitually received on account of sickness or infirmity, such as hospitals, workhouses, and lunatic asylums. The births are not corrected by the distribution of those occurring in Lying-in Institutions. Area of District in acres (exclusive of area covered by water), 1,703.5.

The births registered in the Borough numbered 4,213— 2,122 males and 2,091 females—and were equal to an annual rate of 26.6 per 1,000 of the estimated population, which is 4.4 per 1,000 below the mean rate of the ten years 1900-1909. Of the births registered, 15 were of children whose mothers did not reside in Fulham, while the births of 112 children whose mothers belonged to Fulham occurred in lying-in institutions situate in other Boroughs, so that the nett number of births was 4,310, and the corrected birth-rate 27.2. The birth-rate of the County of London was 23.6, being the lowest recorded since civil registration was adopted, and among the several Metropolitan Boroughs, the rates, after being corrected by distributing those which occurred away from home to the Boroughs in which the mothers ordinarily resided, ranged from 13.3 in the City of London, 14.0 in Hampstead, and 15.3 in Westminster, to 31.6 in Bermondsey, 31.7 in Shoreditch, and 32.1 in Bethnal Green. The continuous decline in the birth-rate in Fulham, which is shared by all civilised communities, is shown in the chart, which gives the birth and mortality rates since 1886, when Fulham was separated from Hammersmith. Unfortunately this decline is chiefly marked among the most serviceable of the community, while there seems but little check to the fertility of the unfit. Thus in Heckfield Place, which is tenanted by as undesirable a class as exists in the whole of London, there were 74 births in an enumerated population of 1,250, representing a birth-rate of 59.2 per 1,000. The following table gives the number of births and the birth-rates in the various wards, corrected by the distribution of the births in Fulham Workhouse, and inclusive of those occurring in outside Maternity Institutions:— 9 TABLE III.

In comparing the birth-rates of communities, it will be remembered that, when calculated on the total population, the birth-rate is, of course, largely influenced by the constitution of the population as regards age, sex and condition as to marriage, and a more accurate measure of the fertility of the population is obtained by calculating the birth-rate on the proportion of legitimate births to married women aged 15 to 45 years. In 1910 the legitimate birth-rate of Fulham per 1,000 married women aged 15 to 45 years was 182.8, and the corresponding rate of the County of London was 186.1. Illegitimacy. The illegitimates numbered 163, or 3.9 per cent, of the births registered in the Borough. Information was not obtained respecting the status of those born outside the Borough, but the percentage of illegitimacy would be much higher among them. Still-born Children. 133 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of 1 still-born child to every 32 living. Excess of Births over Deaths. The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 2,402, compared with 2,422, 2,553 and 2,191 in the three preceding years. 10 TABLE IV.

The deaths of 1,701 persons—853 males and 848 females— were registered in Fulham during 1910; but of these, 99—53 males and 46 females—were of persons not belonging to the Borough, who died within it, while the deaths of 306 residents in Fulham—164 males and 142 females—occurred outside the Borough, chiefly in various public institutions. There were, therefore, 1,908 deaths of persons belonging to Fulham—964 males and 944 females—representing an annual rate of 12.1 per 1,000 of the estimated population, which is the lowest yet recorded, and 2.9 per 1,000 below the average rate of the preceding ten years. The death-rate of males was 12.9, and of females 11.3, assuming the sex constitution of the population to be the same as in 1901. The death-rate of the County of London was 12.7, and among the several Metropolitan Boroughs the lowest death-rates were 8.6 in Hampstead, 9.6 in Lewisham, and 10.2 in Wandsworth, while the highest were 16.7 in Shoreditch, 17.6 in Finbury, and 17.7 in Bermondsey. Corrected Death-rate. Death-rates vary considerably in different localities according to the age constitution of the populations, and in a district with a population comprising a large number of infants or very old people, the death-rate, other things being similar, would of necessity be higher than that of one containing a large proportion of people of middle age. For the correction of the differences due to age and sex constitution, factors of correction have been published by the RegistrarGeneral for the provincial towns, and by the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council for the metropolitan boroughs, and the multiplication of the recorded death-rate of a district by its factor of correction gives the death-rate which would obtain if the age and sex constitution of the population BIRTHS AND DEATHS, 1886-1910. 13 were in the same proportion as it is in the whole of England and Wales, thus eliminating the differences due to age and sex. In the following table the crude and corrected death-rates of Fulham may be compared with those of the adjoining boroughs, the County of London, England and Wales, and the large and small towns. TABLE V. Recorded Death-rate. Corrected Death-rate.

The mortality in the four quarters of the year was as under:— TABLE VI. Deaths. Death-rate. First quarter 520 13.1 Second quarter 450 11.4 Third quarter 414 10.5 Fourth quarter 524 13.2 14 Mortality in Former Years. In Table II. will be found the number of deaths and the death-rate in each of the ten preceding years. The difference between the rate for 3910 and the average of the ten years 1900-1909 represents a saving of 158 lives. Distribution of Deaths.

Infantile Mortality. Of the 1,908 deaths registered, 462 were of infants under one year of age, and the rate of infant mortality, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to births registered in Fulham, was 110 per 1,000, and 107 per 1,000 after the inclusion of the births in metropolitan maternity institutions. This is the lowest infantile deathrate yet recorded, and is 26 per 1,000 below the average rate of the preceding ten years. It should, however, be noted that the fall in the infantile death-rate in Fulham last year was not so marked as that in the death-rate at all ages, the deaths of infants under one year of age forming 24.4 per cent, of the total deaths, as against 22 per cent, in 1909. The corresponding rate of the County of London was 103 per J,000, and the position of Fulham in relation to other metropolitan boroughs was worse than last year, only nine boroughs having a higher infantile mortality, as against eleven in 1909, the rates ranging from 60 per 1,000 in Hampstead to 146 per 1,000 in Shoreditch. In England and Wales the infantile mortality was in the proportion of 106 deaths to 1,000 births, and the 77 great towns had a rate of 115 per 1,000. The cold summer of last year was, of course, very favourable to a low rate of infantile mortality, but it is improbable that the marked improvement of late years, as shown by the accompanying chart, has been entirely due to weather conditions, though we must wait for some hot and dry summers before we decide as to what extent the mortality has been influenced by the efforts made to reduce it. 16 Causes of Infantile Mortality.

Deaths in the year of—Legitimate infants, 414; Illegitimate infants, 48. Population—158,307 (estimated to middle of 1910). Deaths from all Causes at all Ages—1,908.. *Not including those occurring outside the Borough, which are included with the Legitimate Births 19 The rate in Walham Ward is, as usual, much above that of the rest of the borough, which is mainly due to the excessive mortality in Heckfield Place, where it was in the proportion of 284 deaths to 1,000 births. Excluding Heckfield Place, the infantile death-rate of Walham Ward was 125 per 1,000. Prevention of Infant Mortality. Notification of Births Act. 3,327 notifications were received under the above Act, 3,263 of living and 64 of still-born children, 79 per cent, of the births registered being notified. Of these, 2,010, or 60.4 per cent., were notified by midwives; 1,004, or 30.2 per cent., by medical practitioners; and 313 by the fathers or some other relative. 788 mothers were visited by the Sanitary Inspector, Mrs. Davies, who gives personal advice, leaves printed instructions as to feeding, etc., and secures the removal of insanitary defects in the home. It is to be regretted that more cannot be done in this direction, as experience proves that to produce the best results frequent visiting is essential, as the work of educating adult women with ideas of their own is a slow process, and I would again press upon the Council the necessity for the appointment of a Health Visitor for this, and also for other work in connection with the infectious ailments of children, such as Measles and Whooping Cough, and notified cases of Consumption, for which properly trained women are especially suited. The Fulham School for Mothers, which was founded in 1908 with the object of endeavouring to reduce the excessive mortality among infants by the systematic instruction of nursing mothers, has again made most satisfactory progress during the year, as 326 babies were registered by the B 20 Honorary Medical Officers at the consultations held at 92, Greyhound Road, who made 2,287 attendances, as compared with 255 babies registered, with 1,041 attendances, in 1909. The notable increase in the number of attendances is especially gratifying, showing, as it does, the anxiety of the mothers for the welfare of their babies, and their appreciation of the advice given. The school, too, undertakes a considerable amount of home visiting, as it is necessary to supplement the advice given by the doctors at the consultations by practical demonstrations at the homes, and the Committee report that the good results of the visits by the Superintendent of the School are seen in the improved conditions of the homes and more intelligent methods of domestic economy. Dinners are provided at the school for nursing and expectant mothers, when recommended by the doctors, at a charge of 2d. a meal, which is just under the actual cost of the food, and in 1910 3,750 were supplied, and the Medical Officers emphasise the satisfactory results obtained by thus nourishing the child through the mother. Deaths of Illegitimate Infants. Of the children who died before attaining the age of one year, 48 were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 281 deaths per 1,000 births, against 102 per 1,000 among children born in wedlock. The following table gives the causes of death among the illegitimates:- 21 TABLE XI. Deaths of Illegitimate infants from stated Causes in Weeks and Months under One year of age. CAUSE OF DEATH.

Between the ages of one and five years 208 deaths were recorded, so that the deaths of children under the age of five years numbered 670, or 35.1 per cent, of the deaths at all ages. The number corresponds to a death-rate of 32.7 per 1,000 of the children estimated to be living at that age, which is the lowest yet recorded in Fulham. Insurance of Infants. Certificates under the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, were issued in respect of 319 children under five, 47.6 per cent, of the children dying at that age period being insured. Mortality at School Age. At the ages of five to fifteen years, which is approximately the school period of life, there were sixty-five deaths, or 3.5 per cent, of the total number, representing a mortality of 2.0 per 1,000 of those living at that age. Mortality at Adolescence. Between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five years, fiftyeight, or 3.0 per cent, of the total deaths, were recorded, the rate at this age period being 2.1 per 1,000. Mortality at Maturity. 684, or 35.8 per cent, of all the deaths, occurred between the ages of twenty-five and sixty-five years, the mortality being at the rate of 9.5 per 1,000. Mortality at Decline. At the age of sixty-five and upwards there were 431 deaths, or 22.6 per cent. of those at all ages, equal to a death-rate of 83.2 per 1,000. 23 DEATHS FROM EPIDEMIC DISEASES. To the seven principal epidemic diseases, 206 deaths were ascribed, representing a death-rate of 1.30 per 1,000, which is 1.1 below the mean rate of the decennium 1900-1909, and the lowest yet recorded in Fulham. The corresponding rate of the County of London was 1.1 per 1,000, and in the several metropolitan boroughs the rates ranged from 0.60 in Hampstead to 2.1 in Southwark. In Table XII. will be found the number of deaths from each of the principal epidemic diseases in 1910 and the ten preceding years, and in Table XIII. the death-rates from them per 1,000 of the estimated population of each ward in 1910. 24 TABLE XII.

The cases occurred in 231 houses as under:— Houses with one case 211 ,, two cases 14 ,, three cases 6 231 32 Isolation.—Of the cases notified, 230, or 89.5 per cent., were removed to hospital for treatment. Fatality.—There were 14 deaths from the disease, representing a case mortality of 5.4 per cent., which is the lowest yet recorded in Fulham. Supply of Diphtheria Antitoxin. With the view of facilitating the prompt use of diphtheria antitoxin in the cases of persons who may be attacked by or exposed to the infection of the disease, the Local Government Board made an order in August last, under Section 77 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, sanctioning the provision by the Council of a temporary supply of diphtheria antitoxin, and arrangements have been made for its supply to medical practitioners in the borough. The demand for this has been limited, only six applications having been received, since most of the patients are at once removed to hospital; but in cases with laryngeal symptoms, in which, owing to the absence of visible-membrane, a definite diagnosis can only be made by bacteriological examination, the prompt administration of antitoxin without waiting for this result goes far towards preventing a fatal termination should the case prove to be one of laryngeal diphtheria. ENTERIC FEVER. Of enteric fever 18 cases were notified with 2 deaths, the sickness and mortality rates being the lowest recorded in Fulham from this disease. During the ten years 1900-1909 the mean number of cases notified was 66, and the mean number of deaths 12. In 3 cases the infection was contracted outside the borough, and in 2 mussels had been eaten within a fortnight of the commencement of the illness. 33 Typhoid Carriers. The investigation instituted by Dr. Theodore Thomas on behalf of the Local Government Board as to the proportion of patients who are supposed to remain infective after recovery from typhoid owing to their harbouring the bacillus typhosus was continued last year, and specimens of urine and fæces from five patients who had been discharged from hospital were sent to the Lister Institute, but all the examinations— 20 in number—showed the absence of the bacillus. Errors of Diagnosis in Notified Infectious Diseases. Of the patients certified as suffering from scarlet fever, 13, or 3.7 per cent., from diphtheria, 14, or 5.4 per cent., and from enteric fever, 2, or 11.1 per cent., were subsequently ascertained not to be suffering from those diseases. PUERPERAL FEVER. Twenty cases of puerperal septicaemia, or 4.7 per 1,000 births, of which 5, or 1.2 per 1,000, births proved fatal. There was a decline in the number of cases as compared with last year, when 34 cases were notified with 13 deaths, but, in proportion to the population, there were more cases in Fulham than in any metropolitan borough. ERYSIPELAS. 112 persons were certified to be suffering from erysipelas, and 4 deaths were attributed to this disease. CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS. Seven patients were notified as suffering from cerebrospinal fever, but in two cases the diagnosis was not confirmed. There were 3 deaths from the disease, all of which occurred in hospital. In London, in 1910, 115 cases were notified, with 10 deaths. 34 SICKNESS AND DEATHS FROM NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Measles. The deaths from measles in the four quarters of the year were:— 1st Quarter 11 2nd ,, 25 3rd ,, 6 4th „ 23 65 The death-rate was 0.41 per 1,000, being the same as that of the County of London, and 0.11 per 1,000 below the average rate in Fulham in the preceding ten years. Of the deaths, 56, or 86 per cent., were of children under three years of age. 677 cases were reported by the Schools, and, in addition to excluding from school attendance all children from infected houses who were attending the infant classes, and also the children from the same houses in the boys' or girls' departments who had not had measles, the following classes were closed during the periods stated:— Class-rooms closed on Account of Measles during 1910.

In December last the managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board were empowered by the Local Government Board to receive into their hospitals children suffering from measles or whooping cough who are either in the institutions of the Poor Law Guardians or can be admitted into a Poor Law Infirmary by order of the Relieving Officer, and it is to be hoped that this Order will be extended so as to empower the Managers to admit, so far as their hospital accommodation will allow, other besides Poor Law cases of measles into their hospitals, since, as I have on several occasions pointed out, a large proportion of those who succumb to the disease would recover if they could be removed from their unfavourable surroundings and properly nursed. Whooping Cough. Whooping cough was the assigned cause of 60 deaths, or 2 over the decennial average; 58 of the deaths were of children under five years of age. Unfortunately, like C 36 measles, whooping cough is usually looked upon as a very trivial ailment, and comparatively little care is taken of the sufferers, who usually succumb to one of the pulmonary complications of the disease, often induced by neglect. Diarrhæa. The deaths from diarrhœa a in the four quarters of the year were:— No. of Deaths. Death-rate. 1st Quarter 8 0.20 2nd ,, 5 0.13 3rd ,, 31 0.79 4th „ 14 0.35 58 0.37 The mortality was the lowest yet recorded in Fulham, and compared more favourably with that of other metropolitan boroughs than is usually the case, 9 boroughs having higher rates than Fulham, as compared with 4 in 1909. DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOUS DISEASES. There was a marked decline in the mortality from these diseases in 1910—170 deaths (106 of males and 64 of females) being registered from phthisis (tuberculosis of the lungs), and 65 from other tuberculous diseases, against decennial averages of 200 and of 78 respectively. Of the deaths from phthisis, 96 (67 of males and 29 of females) occurred in public institutions. In the several wards of the borough, the death-rates from phthisis and other tuberculous diseases were as under:— 37 Deaths per 1,000 of the population of each Ward from Phthisis and other Tuberculous Diseases. Death-rate from Phthisis. Death-rate from other Tuberculous Diseases. Death-rate from all Tuberculous Diseases. Baron's Court Ward 0.80 0.23 1.03 Lillie Ward 1.38 0.42 1.80 Walham Ward 1.17 0.32 1.49 Margravine Ward 1.62 0.59 2.21 Munster Ward 1.96 0.44 1.36 Hurlingham Ward 1.33 0.33 1.66 Sands End Ward 0.82 0.22 1.04 Town Ward 0.77 0.45 1.22 The Borough 1.07 0.41 1.48 Notification of Phthisis. The following notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis were received during the year:— (a) Notifications of Inmates of Fulham Infirmary 229 Notifications of Inmates of Institutions outside Fulham 16 (b) Notifications by District Medical Officers 180 (c) Notifications of Persons leaving Fulham In- firmary 135 Notification of Persons leaving outside Institutions 8 (d) Notifications by Relieving Officers of persons re- moving 3 571 C 2 38 Of these, 312 were renotifications, the new Poor Law eases notified in 1910 numbering- 259. In addition to the cases notified under the Poor Law Tuberculosis Regulations, the following notifications respecting persons suffering from tuberculosis were received:— From hospitals 50 From private medical practitioners 35 From the Education Department, L.C.C. 7 of which 25 were duplicate notifications, so that the total number of new cases reported was 326. In my report for 1909 I commented on the present unsatisfactory methods of dealing with the notified cases of phthisis, and suggested that of local measures the most suitable would be the establishment in Fulham of a tuberculosis dispensary, modelled on the lines of the Royal Victoria Dispensary for Consumptives in Edinburgh, founded by Dr. R. W. Philip, and it is satisfactory to know that a movement is now on foot, which it is hoped will shortly materialise, to found such an institution in this borough. The essential feature of (he system is the provision of the services of a doctor, who not only sees the patients when they come to the dispensary, but visits them in their homes, and examines other members of the household ; and the value of the latter is shown by the fact that of some 1,500 cases which have been dealt with by the Paddington dispensary nearly one-third were discovered by this home visiting, and in early recognition and treatment lies the chief hope of cure. The doctor, too, is assisted by a trained nurse, who makes periodical visits and endeavours to ensure that patients treated at home shall carry out the instructions they have received. The dispensary also provides the means for classifying the cases and for securing for each the most appropriate treatment, whether in a hospital, sanatorium, or patient's home, and, by co-operation with the various charitable agencies, 39 endeavours to find suitable work for the patient and to assist the family during the incapacity of the breadwinner. DEATHS FROM OTHER DISEASES. Influenza. Twenty-eight deaths were certified to be due to influenza, the numbers for the three preceding years being 33, 33 and 29. Diseases of the Respiratory System. From these diseases there were 356 deaths, or 18.7 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, being 75 below the decennial average, of which 187 were ascribed to pneumonia and 145 to bronchitis. Although pneumonia is usually classed with diseases of the respiratory system, it must be looked upon as a specific febrile disease of bacterial origin analogous to the recognised infectious diseases, such as diphtheria, scarlet fever, etc., and its infectiousness is illustrated by the following cases, which came under my notice last year:— A. B., male, aged 44, residing in Kinnoul Road, was taken ill on March 16th with symptoms of pneumonia, and died on March 24th. J. B., male, aged 19, son of A. B., residing in same house, was taken ill on March 30th with the same symptoms as his father, but his illness was less severe, and he recovered, being convalescent about the middle of April. E. T., female, aged 56, sister of A. B., residing in Tasso Road, nursed A. B. during his illness, was taken ill on April 1st. and died on April 8th. R. C., female, aged 21, living in same house as E. T., visited J. B. during his illness, was taken ill on April 13th, and after a very severe illness recovered. 40 The physical signs in all the cases were those of patchy consolidation of both lungs. The sputum was very viscid, but not rust-coloured, and the report of the Lister Institute on a specimen from R. C. was to the effect that a pure culture of the pneumococcus was isolated, to which it was considered the disease was due, and that the presence in large numbers of another organism morphologicallv resembling the bacillus of Friedlander, but not giving the cultural reactions of any wellknown pathological organism, was not of importance. Cancer. Malignant diseases caused 143 deaths, the average of the preceding ten years being 127. Violence. The deaths of Fulham residents from accident or negligence numbered 62, of which 14 (nearly one-fourth) were caused by suffocation in bed. Other classes of disease caused the following deaths:— Venereal Diseases 16 Diseases of the Nervous System 97 Diseases of the Circulatory System 240 Diseases of the Digestive System 100 Diseases of the Urinary System 73 CERTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH. Of the 1,907 deaths registered, 1,758, or 92.5 per cent., were certified by registered medical practitioners, and the remainder by coroners after inquest, no death being uncertified. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Fulham Infirmary and Workhouse. The deaths of 388 persons (216 males and 172 females) occurred in Fulham Infirmary, and of 27 (18 males and 9 females) in the Workhouse. Of these, 399 belonged to Fulham, and 16 to other districts. 41 Western Fever Hospital. In the Western Fever Hospital there were 92 deaths, 47 males and 45 females, of whom 22 belonged to Fulham, and 70 to other boroughs. Deaths occurring outside the Borough among persons belonging thereto. The deaths of Fulham residents in public institutions and elsewhere outside the borough numbered 306, and occurred in the following institutions:— Charing Cross Hospital 2 Kensington and Fulham General Hospital 1 King's College Hospital 1 Middlesex Hospital 5 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 2 St. George's Hospital 66 St. Mary's Hospital 3 St. Thomas's Hospital 4 Temperance Hospital 1 University College Hospital 3 West London Hospital 53 Westminster Hospital 3 Royal Berkshire Hospital 1 Belgrave Hospital for Children 1 Infants' Hospital 2 Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street 4 Victoria Hospital for Children 29 Chelsea Hospital for Women 2 General Lying-in Hospital 1 Queen Charlotte's Hospital 2 Brompton Hospital 2 Cancer Hospital 9 Royal Ear Hospital 1 Alexandra Hospital, Queen Square 1 Lock Hospital 1 Friedenheim 2 House of Compassion, Paddington 1 42 Atkinson Morley Convalescent Home 1 St. Joseph's Home, Chiswick 1 St. Luke's Home, Kensington 3 Banstead Asylum 14 Camberwell House Asylum 1 Cane Hill Asylum 6 Claybury Asylum 3 Colney Hatch Asylum 3 Hanwell Asylum 12 Horton Asylum 3 Leavesden Asylum 1 Long Grove Asylum 12 Peckham House Asylum 1 Tooting Bec Asylum 4 Children in Infirmary, Carshalton 5 Battersea Infirmary 1 Camberwell Infirmary 1 Chelsea Infirmary 1 Hammersmith Infirmary 6 Holborn Infirmary 2 Kensington Infirmary 1 St. George's Infirmary 2 Wandsworth Infirmary 1 Paddington Workhouse 1 St. Pancras Workhouse 1 Elsewhere 17 306 Of the deaths registered, 710, or 37.2 per cent., took place either in workhouses, in hospitals or in public lunatic asylums. The percentages in Fulham and in the County of London in the various classes of institutions were as under:— Fulham. London. Deaths in workhouses or workhouse infirmaries 21.8 22.4 Deaths in Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals 1.5 1.2 Deaths in other hospitals 10.7 16.1 Deaths in public lunatic and imbecile asylums 3.2 3.7 37.2 43.4 43 GENERAL SANITARY ADMINISTRATION. Disinfection. All infected articles were disinfected at the Council's Disinfecting Station, Townmead Road. The total cost of the station for the year was £893 l1s. 8d., including ,£70 for interest on loans for building and plant, and ,£216 for repayment of principal. The cost during the last three years the work was done by a contractor averaged £1,257. 1,358 rooms were disinfected and cleansed, viz.:— After Scarlet Fever 355 ,, Diphtheria 250 „ Enteric Fever 25 ,, Erysipelas 54 ,, Puerperal Fever 22 ,, Measles 295 ,, Phthisis 300 ,, other diseases 25 Verminous 32 PUBLIC MORTUARY. 147 bodies were removed to the Mortuary during the year and were admitted as follows:— At the request of the Coroner 105 Brought in by the Police 21 At the request of the Medical Officer of Health 1 ,, ,, Relieving Officer 5 For convenience till funeral 15 147 Inquests were held on 125, and post-mortem examinations made in 73 of the above cases. 44 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. The facilities afforded by the Council for the bacteriological examination of suspected material as an aid to diagnosis continue to be much appreciated by medical practitioners, and the following specimens were examined during the year by the Lister Institute:— Material from cases of suspected Diphtheria:— Number of Specimens. Klebs Löffler or true diphtheria bacillus isolated 92 Pseudodiphtheria bacillus of Hoffmann isolated 30 Negative result 214 336 Examinations of blood from cases of suspected enteric fever:— Widal or typhoid reaction obtained 12 ,, ,, not obtained 6 18 Examinations of sputa from cases of suspected tuberculosis:— Tubercle bacillus found 67 ,, ,, not found 280 347 Examinations of cerebrospinal fluid:- Meningococcus isolated - Negative 2 2 Other examinations 5 708 FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The workshops where women are employed have been regularly inspected by your Sanitary Inspector, Mrs. Davies, and were found to be in a fairly satisfactory condition. Thirty-eight notices served by her on account of want of 45 cleanliness were Complied with. The other workshops are supervised by the Sanitary Inspectors in their respective districts. Outworkers. 261 visits were made to the homes of outworkers, and six notices were served in respect of nuisances observed. No case of infectious illness was reported in any outworker's home. Bakehouses. There are 70 bakehouses on the register, of which 50 are underground. Five breaches of the special requirements for bakehouses were dealt with. The following tables prepared at the request of the Secretary of State for the Home Department give a summary of the work done in connection with the Factory Act:— Administration oj the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, in connection with Factories, Workshops, Workplaces a!nd Homework. 1.—INSPECTION OF FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS AND WORKPLACES.

There are 172 milk shops on the register which have been kept under supervision by your Food Inspector. The power which the Council possesses under the London County Council General Powers Act, 1908, to remove unsuitable premises from the register has enabled us to secure better conditions for safeguarding the purity of the milk while stored in the retail shops. 49 Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses. The licences of the undermentioned cowsheds and slaughterhouses were renewed by the London County Council in October, no objections being raised by the Borough Council:— Cowsheds. Premises.

The average composition of the 277 samples purchased as new milk was:— Solids other than fat 8.67 Fat 3.52 Water 87.81 Milk Warranties. In April last summonses were issued against two vendors for having sold milk from which 16 per cent. of the original fat had been abstracted, which were dismissed in each case on the ground that the milk had been purchased with a p 52 ranty as to its purity, and was sold in the same condition in which it was received. The samples had been purchased by the Inspector within a short time of each other on the same day, and had been supplied to the retailers by the same wholesale firm under identical warranties, and as both showed, according to the Analyst's certificate, exactly the same amount of adulteration, on which fact the magistrate commented, summonses were issued under section 20 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, against the wholesale company for having given a false warranty in respect of the milk. The magistrate, after hearing the evidence, stated that he was satisfied that the retailer had sold the milk in the same state as he received it, and that it was in such a state when it arrived at Paddington Station. He held that the wholesale company must take every reasonable precaution to justify their belief in the warranty, and they had not done so. The contract with the farmer was not signed, and the company had therefore no warranty from her to support their own. The churns had been sent unlocked, so that it was an easy thing for anyone to tamper with a churn during transit, which was what had probably happened. The Company had not insisted on churns being locked as they should, and could easily have done, and therefore they had not satisfied him as to the sufficiency of the reason for their belief. He found the warranty given by them was false, and imposed a penalty of £5, with ,£3 3s. costs. The company subsequently appealed to the County of London Sessions against the conviction, when, after hearing the evidence and the arguments of the counsel for respondent and the appellants, the Chairman (Mr. Wallace, K.C.), in giving the decision of the Court, stated that the magistrate had practically held that unless the churns were locked the appellants had not complied with their obligations. There 53 was nothing in the Act to justify such a contention, and the Court held that the appellants believed the warranty to be true, and the appeal was therefore allowed and the conviction quashed, with costs against the Borough Council. Particulars of this case were forwarded by the Borough Council to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture, with the intimation that they were satisfied that it is useless in future to institute proceedings with regard to false warranties in milk cases with any likelihood of success, unless the existing provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts relating thereto are considerably amended and strengthened, and that, pending such amendment, they do not propose to prosecute in respect of false warranties in milk cases. Under the law as it stands, the Local Authority must take proceedings against the vendor of the milk, and on being met with a warranty must proceed in turn against the wholesale dealer and farmer, being in each case met with evidence they have no means either of testing or rebutting, and the responsibility for the adulteration is eventually placed upon the cow, and although the milk has undoubtedly been tampered with no one is punished, and, in spite of the expense they incur, the Local Authority is unable to effectively protect the public. The simplest course would be to make the person actually selling the adulterated milk responsible and liable to conviction for such sale, and if he has obtained a warranty from the person who supplied him, he should be entitled to recover damages against such person for any loss he may sustain owing to the conviction, provided he proves that he sold the milk in the same condition as he received it. Another case in which the proceedings taken by the Council in respect of adulterated milk failed was one in which an itinerant vendor of milk, on being overtaken by the Inspector, whom he had endeavoured to evade, informed him that he was not selling milk but " milk and water," and a sample was D 2 54 purchased by the Inspector as "milk and water." The certificate of the Analyst was to the effect that the sample consisted of:— Milk deprived of at least 43 per cent. of its fat 54 per cent. Added water 46 ,, and had, therefore, the composition of "skimmed milk" and water. A summons was issued against the vendor for having sold to the prejudice of the purchaser "milk and water" which was not of the nature, substance and quality demanded, in that it had the composition of "skimmed milk" and water. The summons was dismissed by the magistrate, with £2 2s. costs against the Council, on the ground that, as the Analyst was unable to state in his evidence that no "milk" at all was present in the sample, the purchaser was not prejudiced, as he had purchased it as milk and water; and even if there were but a spoonful of milk to a bucket of water, the sample consisted of milk and water. Cocoa. Proceedings were taken in respect of a number of samples of cocoa, which were certified by the Analyst to be adulterated by the addition of "cocoa shell." In the manufacture of cocoa, the cocoa bean after being roasted, is crushed and winnowed, whereby the light shell is removed, which is used for other purposes, and its presence in what is sold as pure cocoa, except in a minute proportion, must be looked upon as an adulteration. Convictions were obtained in the cases in which the shell amounted to 30 per cent. or over, but in a case in which the sample was certified to contain 18 per cent. of shell, the summons was dismissed, the magistrate holding that its presence to this extent did not constitute adulteration. 55 Prosecutions under the Sale of Foods and Drugs Acts were instituted by the Council in the following cases:— Defendant.

In September last the Local Government Board issued regulations under section 17 (1) of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, for enforcing the systematic inspection of dwelling-houses. The Medical Officer of Health is required to report upon the particular dwelling-houses which in his opinion require inspection. Records of all inspections made are to be kept, which must contain information as to:— (a) The arrangements for preventing the contamination of the water supply. (b) Closet accommodation. (c) Drainage. (d) The conditions of the dwelling-houses in regard to light, (he free circulation of air, dampness and cleanliness. (e) The paving, drainage and sanitary condition of any yard or outhouse belonging to the premises. (f) The arrangements for the deposit of refuse and ashes. (g) The existence of any room which would, in pursuance of section 17 (7), be a dwelling-house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. (h) Any defect in other matters which may tend to render the dwelling-house dangerous or injurious to the health of an inhabitant. 59 The following list of houses, of which, in my opinion, an early inspection was necessary, was submitted to the Public Health Committee. Heckfield Place. Hatfield Street. Norfolk Terrace. Francis Street. Field Road. Caroline Place. Carlton Mews. Burlington Gardens. Northampton Place. 48-82, Parson's Green Lane. Sotheron Road. Walham Avenue. Melton Street. Shotley Street. Lundy Street. Prince of Wales Mews. 61 & 63, Aspenlea Road. Guiver's Cottages. Burlington Road. Elysium Road. 2-32, Peterborough Road. Cambria Street. Edith Row. Hartopp Avenue. Lodge Avenue. Bedford Place. Werley Avenue. Rock Avenue. The number of dwelling-houses inspected under and for the purposes of Section 17 was as under:— Houses inspected. Houses represented as unfit for habitation. Closing Orders made. Houses in which defects were remedied without making Closing Orders. Houses in which repairs were not completed on Dec. 31st, 1910. 103 22 6 25 50 Notices under the Public Health (London) Act, requiring the abatement of the nuisances discovered, have been served in respect of some of the houses outstanding; at others the owners, after visiting them with me, have arranged to carry out the necessary repairs. 60 The following were the houses represented by me as being in such a state as to be unfit for human habitation:— Houses represented as unfit for habitation. Action of Council. 2, 4, 6, 12 and 18 Peterborough Road Closing Orders made. The Cottage, Peterborough Mews Closing Order made. 48—68 (even Nos.) Parson's Green Lane. Consideration adjourned. 74—78 (even Nos.) Parson's Green Lane. " " The owner of the houses in Parsons Green Lane came before the Public Health Committee, and offered to close these houses within six months, and not to relet any house that became vacant during that period. On that undertaking the Public Health Committee adjourned the consideration of making closing orders in respect of the houses. In addition to the houses represented as unfit for habitation under the Housing Act, 13 houses in Langford Road and 3 in Bagley's Lane, containing 48 tenements, were closed by the owner on receipt of intimation notices, under the Public Health (London) Act. Of these, six, after thorough repair, have been reoccupied, while the remaining ten are still closed. Regulations as to Underground Rooms habitually used as Sleeping Places. Section 17 (7) of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act provides that— A room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than 3ft. below the 61 surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room, shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a dwelling-house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, if the room either— (a) Is not on an average at least 7ft. in height from floor to ceiling; or (b) Does not comply with such regulations as the local authority, with the consent of the Local Government Board, may prescribe for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of such rooms, and the protection thereof against dampness, effluvia, or exhalation. Provided that if the Local Sanitary Authority fail to make such regulations, or such regulations as the Board approve, the Board may themselves make them, and the regulations so made shall have effect as if they had been made by the local authority, with the consent of the Board. Provided that a closing order made in respect of a room to which this sub-section applies shall not prevent the room being used for purposes other than those of a sleeping place; and that, if the occupier of the room, after notice of an order has been served upon him, fails to comply with the order, an order to comply therewith may, on summary conviction, be made against him. Suggested regulations in accordance with the above were submitted by me to the Public Health Committee on July 5th, and are still under the consideration of the Council. CERTIFICATES UNDER THE REVENUE ACTS. Applications were received for certificates under the Revenue Acts for exemption from an abatement of inhabited house duty in respect of 625 tenements, of which 158 were 62 granted, 415 were given after certain specified works had been completed, and 42 were refused. Certificates in respect of 422 dwellings, which had been granted for a limited period, were renewed. DRAINAGE OF BUILDINGS. During the year the following drainage plans were submitted to and approved by the Public Health Committee:— Plans of drainage of new houses 17 Plans of drainage of workshops, etc. 9 Plans of drainage of additions to existing buildings 16 Plans of the reconstruction of the drainage of existing buildings 143 Combined Drainage. hour systems of combined drainage tor portions of which the Council was liable, owing to certain of the pipes which received the drainage of more than one building, forming "sewers" within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act, were reconstructed during the year at a cost to the Council of £178 4s. 3d., the work being carried out by a contractor under a schedule of prices. The sum of £58 19s. was also paid to owners in respect of work executed by them in compliance with notices served by the Council at eight houses in connection with house drains, which were "sewers" as defined by the Metropolis Management Act. HOUSES INFESTED WITH VERMIN. Notices were served in respect of 28 rooms under section 20 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, which gives power to the sanitary authority to require the cleansing of any house infested with vermin. 63 CLEANSING OF CHILDREN. A communication was received from the London County Council asking whether the Borough Council would be willing to co-operate with the London County Council in carrying out a scheme for the cleansing of school children infested with vermin, on the following lines:— 1. That the cleansing stations provided by the various Metropolitan Borough Councils should, as far as possible, be utilised by agreement with the Borough Councils. 2. That the treatment of children should be entirely distinct from any establishment used for the isolation of suspected cases of infectious disease contacts. 3. That the exclusive use of the baths for the cleansing of children should be allowed on certain days. 4. That the cleansing station should be in a convenient position, and that the children should be efficiently supervised, with female attendants for the treatment of the girls. 5. That a uniform payment to the Borough Councils at the rate of 2s. per child, irrespective of the number of baths required before the child can be regarded as cleansed, should be arranged throughout London. 6. That this scheme be subject to the Borough Council's undertaking, where necessary, to deal with the homes of the children cleansed. As the Borough Council have no cleansing station, I reported to the Public Health Committee respecting the acquirement of some premises I considered suitable for the purpose, and the probable cost of the equipment and maintenance; but the Committee, after considering the matter, 64 decided to take no action, and informed the County Council that they could not see their way to recommend the Borough Council to co-operate on the lines indicated. PUBLIC SANITARY CONVENIENCES. These have been kept under regular supervision by the Inspectors. A notice under section 22 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, requiring the reconstruction of a convenience attached to a public house was served, and is being complied with. Many complaints have again been received respecting the constantly recurring nuisance at and adjacent to the convenience attached to the public house in Hammersmith Road, opposite Olympia, owing to the accommodation being wholly inadequate for the needs of the public using it. As has been frequently pointed out, the provision of a public sanitary convenience in this locality is much needed. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. 1,182 complaints were received and dealt with by the Sanitary Inspectors, and 1,G72 intimation and 372 statutory notices were served. Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act. A summons was issued against W. Hancock, under section 42 of the Public Health (London) Act, for so repairing a drain as to be a nuisance, and a fine of with £2 2s. costs, was imposed. The following summary has been prepared at the request of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council:— 65 PREMISES. NUMBER OF PLACES. Number of Inspections, 1910. Number of Notices, 1910. Number of Prosecutions, 1910. On register .it end of 1909. Added in 1910. Removed in 1910. On register at end of 1910.
