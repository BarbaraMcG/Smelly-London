STPAN 32. St. Pancras, Middlesex. TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being the Report for the Year 1875. —— TO THE VESTRYMEN OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, During the year 1875, the number of births registered in the Parish of St. Pancras was 8,010, and of deaths, 5,416, Deducting the deaths of non-parishioners in public institutions, and making due allowance for the deaths of parishioners in hospitals, the corrected number of deaths was 5,401, The births were exactly the same in number as in the preceding year 1874. The deaths in 1875, exceeded those of 1874, by 419. In April, 1871, when the last census was taken, the actual population of St. Pancras was 221,465. During the preceding ten years the average annual rate of increase of population was 1.1 per cent. Assuming that the population had continued to progress at the same rate, the estimated population in the middle of the year 1875, was 232,000. But since, year by year, during the decade 1861-71, the rate of increase of our local population was continually decreasing, the above estimate of population in 1875 is doubtless too high, and in my tables and calculations I have taken 231,000 as the population in the middle of the year under review. Even this estimate is perhaps too high ; for the fact that during the last three years the births have been stationary hide Table I.) points to a non-increasing population. It is hence highly probable that my calculations as to mortality rates are too low The annual rate of mortality in 1875 was 23.38 per 1,000 persons living, and this is exactly the average of the rates during the preceding ten years. The rate of mortality was l.63 per 1,000 higher than in 1874. 2 Table II. shows that the mortality in 1875 was greater among infants and young children, and I may add that the mortality was also greater among adults, than in 1874. Table III. tabulates the deaths from various diseases, and specifies the ages of the persons deceased. In this table the deaths in hospitals are excluded. In Table IV. the deaths from various diseases are classified; and the most important classes of diseases are exhibited in various forms, so as to shew not only gross numbers, but also the ratio of deaths from these diseases to the population, and to the total deaths. Table V. exhibits at a glance the deaths from the seven principal zymotic diseases in 1875, and compares the deaths not only with the mortality from these diseases in the Metropolis during the same year, but also with our local mortality during the preceding ten years. It will be noted that in 1875, the deaths from the principal zymotic diseases were a little below the metropolitan rate, and also a little below the average local rate from these diseases. The death rate of the Metropolis was 23.7, or 0.3 per 1,000 higher than in St. Pancras. If the death rate in this Parish be compared, however, with that of the North Registration Districts, of which it is a part, the comparison is by no means so favourable; for in these districts the annual rate of mortality was 22.3 only, or 1.0 per 1000 lower than in St. Pancras. Table VI., shows the amount of work carried out by the Inspectors under my supervision. Tables VII. and VIII. furnished by the Vaccination Officer, show that in not 2 per cent. of the registered births is there no return as to vaccination; and that 89 per cent, of the children horn in the Parish were either successfully vaccinated in the Farish or died before being vaccinated. SMALL POX. Three cases only of this disease terminated fatally ; and the disease was but little prevalent. There were several cases of so called chickenpox in a rather severe form, some of which I have little doubt were really cases of small pox modified by vaccination. MEASLES were very prevalent, being largely disseminated through schools. Happily only 82 cases terminated fatally, which is perhaps a very small per centage of the total number of eases of illness from this disease. 8 SCARLET FEVER The prevailing epidemic of this disease rapidly increased in severity as the year advanced, and causcd 220 deaths. The severity of the epidemic made large demands on the time and energies of your officers. Scarlet Fever was more fatal than in any year since 1870. DIPHTHERIA was more fatal than in any of the preceding ten years. It causcd 55 deaths. HOOPING COUGH told with great severity upon weakly children, of whom 232 succumbed. This disease is so eminently contagious, and our means of preventing its extensions in the earlier stages so inadequate, that when once a few cases get imported into a district, the disease is certain to spread spite of all precautions. FEVER. I am happy to state that the Parish was never in my experience, so free from typhus and typhoid (enteric) fever; and the mortality (58) from these diseases was only half that of the average of the preceding ten years. DIARRHŒA was also distinctly less fatal than usual, the deaths being 25 per cent. below the average rate of the preceding ten years, and lower than in any one of those years. The large demands made upon the energies of your officers by the existence of so much preventible disease, by the necessity of periodical inspection of the worst portions of the Parish under the Sanitary Act, 1866, and by a resolution of the Vestry, asking for information with a view to proceedings under a Statute of the last Session of Parliament resulted in temporary embarrassment; and the obvious inability of one of your then Inspectors to deal with his district induced me to represent to the Vestry the need which existed for a more extended staff. I am happy to state that the extension of the staff, and the re-arrangement of duties which eventually resulted, is, I believe, already bearing good fruit; and I hope to be able to secure a more thorough and frequent periodical inspection of the Parish than heretofore. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. A great improvement is observable in these places. It has rarely been necessary to enforce the Bye-laws relating to them by legal 4 precedings; and I am happy to think that the Slaughtermen themselves coincide with the necessity of strictly complying with Sanitary requirements. There are still several Slaughter-houses which I should like to see abolished; but even these compare very favourably with their state before the new law came into force. COW SHEDS are, as a rule, well kept; but some few of them give trouble through want of cleanliness, and the keeping of an excessive number of cows. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, THOS. STEVENSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health and Examiner of Gas. Sanitary Department, Vestry Hall, Pancras Road, N.W.

The estimate of population may be checked by the known number of inhabited houses, and by the average number of inmates per house, as ascertained at the preceding Census. ** The deaths of non-parishioners in public institutions within the parish is deducted, but a proportion of the deaths occurring in General Hospitals, relative to the population of the parish or district, is added to the total number of deaths registered. 6 Table II.
