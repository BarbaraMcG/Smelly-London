Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1889, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £70,081 4s. 2d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four quarters was 2s 2d., being for the quarter to Midsummer, 7d.; to Michaelmas, 8d.; to Christmas, 7d.; and to Lady-day, 7d. During the previous year the Poor Rate was 2s. The amount of the Guardians' calls for the year ending Ladyday, 1888, was £48,900; and for the last year, £57,000; and for the half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1889, is £24,700. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1889, was £7,000. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rates will be found in the Balance Sheets, as audited and signed. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The statement hereto appended will give the details of the Receipts and Expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last year were— s. d, General—in the £ 1 9 Sewers ditto 0 1 0 2 7 8 The total amount collected on the Vestry Rates for the year was £75,667 2s. 5d., a decrease upon the previous year of £3,667 6s. 1d. Of these sums collected by the Vestry as for Poor Rates large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposes over which the Vestry has no control. Thus, in addition to the £55,500 paid to the Guardians, out of which the County Rate and Metropolitan Asylum's Board's charges were paid, there was a sum of £13,380 6s. l0d. paid to the Commissioners of Metropolitan Police, and £543 3s. 2d. for Registration, &c., expenses. From the Sewers Rate was paid the Metropolitan Board's Consolidated Rate of £19,837 12s. 3d. From the General Rate is paid the School Board Rate of £21,207 7s. 7d., and the Toll Bridges Precept of £2,560 6s. 4d. All these charges are based upon the rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses, nor for the allowance to owners. ASSESSMENT. The valuation of the Parish for Assessment purposes, for the year beginning the 5th of April, 1889, is as follows:— April, 1888. April, 1889. Increase. Gross value. £790,553 £793,299 £2,746 Rateable value. £642,133 £644,246 £2,113 The next complete revision of the Valuation List will take place in 1890, and will come into operation on the 6th of April. 1891. The number of Assessments and the Rateable value of each Ward, omitting such of the Gas, Water, Railway and other Assessments, as are included in several Wards at Lady-day last, were as follows:— 9  Number of Assessments. Rateable Value. Moorfields Ward 1,429 81,087 Church Ward North 1,973 55,629 Church Ward South 1,092 62,221 Hoxton Ward 2,371 71,521 Wenlock Ward 1,811 54,202 Whitmore Ward 2,319 54,948 Kingsland Ward 1,730 44,523 Haggerstone Ward 1,620 34,751 Acton Ward 1,753 39,755 The Rateable Value of the Parish is made up as follows:— Railways £63.034 Gas Company 30,275 Water Companies 7,741 Tramway Company 3,210 Regent's Canal Company 738 Board Schools 12,124 Hoxton House Asylum 1,063 Theatres and Taverns attached thereto 1,571 The Town Hall 1,000 Other Assessments of £500 and upwards, including Model Dwellings of that value 25,083 The Workhouse and Infirmary, belonging to the Holborn Union in the City Road, is by Local Act rated at £19 only. The Shoreditch Workhouse and Infirmary is not assessed. The total of the above is £145,839, which shows that the ordinary Assessments, under £500, amount to £498,637. BANKING ARRANGEMENTS. The Vestry gave consideration to the arrangements with the Treasurer as to allowance of interest on balances. With the exception of some allowance made on larger sums occasionally 10 borrowed for paving and other purposes, no interest had been allowed. The Vestry obtained terms from the London and County, the City and the Central Bank, and accepted those of the latter, and appointed Mr. W. Smith, of the Shoreditch Branch, as Treasurer. The terms are, interest allowed on minimum fortnightly balances at one per cent. under bank rate. The probable receipts from this source will be from £150 to £200 per year. LONDON COUNTY GOVERNMENT. The most important legislation of last year affecting the Metropolis was the passing of the Local Government Act. The effect of this was to separate that part of the Metropolis which was under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Vestries and District Boards, as established by the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, from the rest of Middlesex, Surrey and Kent. London is now, for administrative purposes, a County in itself. The London County Council takes over all the powers of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was superseded and which ceased to exist on the 28th of March last. It takes over also some of the powers formerly exercised by the County Justices, for instance, the control of the County Asylums, Industrial Schools &c., the granting of Music and Dancing Licenses, but not the Licensing of places for the sale of intoxicating drinks. The revenue of the County Council consists partly of Local Hates levied as Poor rates, and partly of Government grants in the form of Licensing duties, Probate duties &c. The Coal and Wine duties which formed part of the revenue of the Metropolitan Board will cease in July next, and therefore will form no part of the revenue of the County Council. It is too early yet to attempt to calculate the effect of the establishment of the County Council upon the financial burdens of the Metropolis, but it may be said that almost one of the first acts of the London County Council was to levy a contribution upon the ratepayers of 12.55d. in the £, exclusive of the City, which is only 10.65d., because the City maintains its own Police, Asylums. &o., which outside the City are charged to the Metropolis. Of this 11 12.55d., fd. is said to represent the amount which would have been, had the change not taken place, chargeable as a County Rate on the Poor Rate, so that 10.80d. may be said to represent the amount raised by rates by the County Rate instead of by the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate. This may be subject to some slight modification owing to certain financial arrangements, which cannot be conveniently explained in detail here, but appended is the estimate issued by the County Council, which may help to elucidate a very complicated subject. Of the 12.55d. above mentioned, only 7-12ths have been levied for the first half year, leaving 5-12ths to be raised in the second half-year; but there is reason to believe that this amount will be increased. It has been the practice for the Government to contribute from the Consolidated Fund towards the cost of the Police and other local burdens. These contributions will now cease; but in lieu thereof, the Government will band over to the County Council the License, Probate and other dues which are set out in the estimate of the Connty Council. It would appear that this arrangement will be a benefit to the ratepayers, but if there should be a balance in favor of the ratepayers, as shown in the estimate referred to, it must be borne in mind that the oessation of the Coal and Wine dues will create a deficit which must be charged to the rates, unless one or two things happen:—either the County Council must suspend any further Metropolitan Improvements, or some other source of revenue than that of local taxation must be found. There are two features connected with the financial arrangements of the County Council which may have a special local apart from general interest. The one is the provision for the payment to the various Boards of Guardians of a sum equal to 4d. per head per day towards the maintenance of in-door paupers belonging to the Parish or Union. As the total of these contributions will be equal to a rate for that amount levied upon the Metropolis, it follows that those Unions and Parishes where the number of in-door paupers is to the rateable value greater than the average, the contribution will be advantageous to those parishes, and where the number of in-door poor is less than the average, the 12 contrary will be the result. Some areas belonging to the former class may contribute 2d. in the £ and receive 4d , while others may contribute 4d. and receive 2d. There is reason to believe that Shorediteh will be found to be near the average, so that the arrangement will be neither gain or loss to the ratepayers. The other feature is the change of the incidence of the metropolitan burdens from the Sewers Rate to the Poors Rate. This appears to have been an oversight in the framing of the Act, but the effect of it is in all those cases where the landlords had agreed to pay the Sewers Rate, to Transfer from the landlord to the tenant a yearly rate of about l0d. in the £. Of course there is nothing to prevent landlords from still making the allowance to the tenants if they please. Some landlords may do so, but it is optional, as the Poor Rate is a tenant's and not like the Sowers a landlord's rate. There is reason to believe that the Government see the hardship of this ohange, and meaDS may be found during the present Session to provide a remedy. MAINTENANCE OF MAIN ROADS. A very important item of Local Administration in the Metropolis, consequent on the passing of the Local Government Act, will be that of the maintenance and the arrangements to be made for the cost of maintaining the Main Roads. The Acts of Parliament whioh authorised the County Justices to contribute towards the cost of keeping up these roads had very little application to the Metropolis, as only those roads whioh were disturnpiked after 1870 were so dealt with ; but by the Aot of last year the London County Council may contribute towards the oost of maintaining all main roads in the Metropolis. It would seem to be left to the County Council to decide which are Main as distinot from Local roads, and this the Council will probably do upon the application of the various Vestries and District Boards. When this has been done, the Vestries and District Boards may claim to retain the management and repair in their own hands, and the County Council may require the Vestries to continue the maintenance as at present. The general opinion of the Vestries seems to 13 be in favor of this arrangement, and it becomes therefore simply a question of how much the County Council shall contribute, and there may also be a question as to what expenses are to be included under the head of maintenance. Will the mere cost of repairs and renewals be allowed, or will the cost of Scavenging and Watering be included ? The County Council has given no intimation of how these questions may be decided, and it is not improbable that further legislation will be necessary to settle them. Whatever may be inoluded in the cost of maintenance, the County Council will probably contribute one half, but as this contribution will have to be raised by the rates, the effect of the arrangement may in some parishes be but small, but in others it may prove a gain or a loss to the particular parish. The amount of contribution in cases of difference between the claims of the Yestries and the offer of the County Council is to be settled by an Arbitrator to be appointed by the Local Government Board, and it is not difficult to foresee that some trouble and expense will be incurred in the settlement of these claims. No contribution is to be made by the County Council in respect to any road which is not certified by the County Surveyor to be in a fair condition of repair, and there are many roads in the Metropolis which, in their present condition, are very unlikely to be certified. They must therefore be kept in their defective condition by the parishes, or considerable outlay must be incurred to put them in a passable state. This Vestry has not yet made any claim in respect to the main roads in Shoreditch, as it was anticipated that the County Council would lay down some general principles to secure uniformity of system throughout the metropolis, which has not yet been done, but the time is approaching when the Vestry will be required to make its claims upon the County Council.* *Since the above was written the Vestry has submitted the following list of places as Main Roads, which is now under consideration by the London County Roads:— 14 MAIN Shoreditch High Street Kingsland Road Great Cambridge Street Queen's Road Old Street Hackney Road Tabernacle Street Pitfield Street City Road St. John's Road East Road Whitmoro Road Great Eastern Stroet Commercial Street Worship Street ROADS. Bethnal Green Road Hyde Road Shepherdess Walk Goldsmith Row Mintern Street (portion of) Paud Street Wilson Street Curtain Road Appold Street Hoxton Street Bridport Place Sun Street Brunswick Street Haggerston Road Pownall Road THE REGISTER OF VOTERS. One result of the passing of the Local Government Act and the Electors Act has been the provision of a County Council Register. This Register comprises all the Parliamentary Electors except Lodger and Service voters, and all women who possess the same occupation qualification as is necessary to confer on male persons the Parliamentary franchise. But the law of franchises is still very confused and unreasonable. There are the Parliamentary, the County Council, the Boards of Guardians, the Vestries and the School Board Electors, no two of them having a like qualification. THE COUNTY COUNCIL ELECTION. The election throughout the metropolis took place on the 17th of January last. It was conducted on similar lines to the Parliamentary Elections. The Deputy Returning Officer for the Borough of Shoreditch was the Vestry Clerk, and the members returned were—for the Hoxton Division, Mr. Edwin Austin and Mr. Nathan Moss; and for the Haggerston Division, Mr. J. F. B. Firth, M.P., and Lord Monks well. The elected members continue in office for three years. 15 SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS. A Bill has been introduced in the House of Commons to make the Parliamentary Divisions of the Metropolis Areas for School Board Elections. The Vestry petitioned in favor of the Bill, but there seems no disposition on the part of the Government to facilitate its progress and little probability of its passing this session. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Notices of application were given during the year by the London Electric Supply Corporation, of application for a Provisional Order, and by the House-to-House Electric Light Supply Company, for a License to supply Electricity to this Parish. The Vestry refused its consent to both applications, mainly on the ground that there was no evidence of any demand in Shoreditch for a supply, and that the Companys did not offer sufficient guarantee for the protection of the ratepayers' interests. A Board of Trade enquiry took place, the result of which appears to be that some of the applications for other districts will be granted. Both applications relating to this parish were withdrawn, consequently the Vestry did not appear at the Enquiry. RAILWAYS, TRAMWAYS, &c. No application was made to Parliament in the last Session for any Bill affecting this parish in respect to the above. But exercising the powers previously obtained, the Great Eastern Railway Company is making rapid progress with the widening and Station improvement in Shoreditch. The North London or the London and North Western Railway seems to be making some progress with the Columbia Market Junction, but the Columbia Market Railway itself appears to be entirely in abeyance ; and we still look in vain for any sign of the construction of the Regent's Canal Railway, for which an extension of time was granted two years ago, or of the widening of the line by the London and North Western Company at Plough Yard, Shoreditch. It is probable that neither of these two last mentioned will be carried out. 16 RATING OF ADVERTISEMENT STATIONS, &c. A Bill has been introduced to make these stations the subject of rating, and a Bill for the suppression of indecent advertisements. There is a probability of these measures passing, and they will be of some importance to Local Authorities. PAROCHIAL CHARITIES. A Committee was appointed by the Vestry in March, 1888, to enquire into the past and present management of the Parochial Charities of Shoreditoh. The Committee has not yet presented its report. SCAVENGING. The General Purposes Committee recommended and the Vestry adopted a suggestion to divide the parish into four divisions for Scavenging and Dusting, instead of two. These Divisions were made but without practical result, as the Vestry acoepted two Contractors for one Division each upon nearly the same lines as before. The oontraots for this work are £1,900 higher than last year, being a total of £9,400. TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 109 times; the Counoil Chamber, 7 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by local Societies on several occasions. The receipts for letting Hall, Council Chamber and Committee Rooms were £573 12s. 6d. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The number of Vestry and Committee Meetings held during the year ended 1st May, 1889, is as follows:— 17 Number of Vestry Meetings 45 Finance Committee (including Meetings of Audit Committee) 37 Sewers, &c., Committee 29 General Purposes Committee 22 Valuation Committee (including Sub-Committee) 8 Town Hall Committee ditto 28 Parliamentary and Improvement Committee 8 Total 175 DISORDERLY HOUSES, &c. Several places of improper character have been suppressed by summary proceedings, and without expense to the Vestry. In some cases the parties have quitted on notice without prosecution. APPENDICES. Appended are various Tables showing Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities, Loans outstanding, Analyst's Reports, List of Contracts, &c., &c. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, E. WALKER, Vestry Clerk. Town Hall, Old Street, July, 1889. 19 Administratibe County of london.

The Rateable Value on the 6th of April, 1889, will be— City of London £3,853,497 Parishes outside the City 27,734,063 £31,587,560 This includes £200,581 estimated value of property outside the official list, on which Government pays a contribution in lieu of rates. 5. The Contribution required from the City will be equivalent to a rate of 10.65d. The Contribution required from the Parishes outside the City will be the same, 10.65d. with the addition of 1.9d. for special purposes ; or together, 12.55d. 22 6. In stating the Rate required, it should he borne in mind that 3.97d. of the entire amount of 12.55d. is in respect of Expenditure formerly defrayed by Local bodies other than the Metropolitan Board, viz., £182,693 Sundry Costs defrayed by Counties; £5,339 charge for Main Roads maintained by Vestries and District Boards; and £335,000 the new charge for maintenance of Indoor Poor in relief of the Poor Rate. The last precept of the Metropolitan Board was equivalent to a rate of l0d.; the contribution now required, exclusive of amounts formerly raised in the rates of other Bodies, is 8 58d. The difference is owing to the aid received from what were formerly Imperial resources. 7. It is estimated that 7-12ths of the above amounts will be required in the first six monhts, and 5-12ths in the second six months of the financial year. Required in First Six Months. Required in Second Six Months.

THOS. STEVENSON, Analyst. REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR. Surveyor's Department. Gentlemen, I beg to submit a summary of works, &c., carried out under the superintendence of the above Department during the year ending the 25th March, 1889. MAINTENANCE OF ROADS. The following quantities of materials were supplied by the Contractors and Guardians at the cost stated, and used on the Macadam and ballast roads in the parish during the year:— 563 yards cube Broken Granite £358 6 1 169¾ „ „ Flints 50 18 5 25 „ „ Ballast 7 4 11 2795/8 „ „ Hoggin 79 4 9 During the year 439 cubic yards of old pebbles, York, etc., were broken up, costing £50 3s. 10d., and loaded and carted for repairing the roads at a further cost of about £54 17s. 6d. 51 52 One foreman and seven laborers on an average were employed in the yard, and on the general repairs of the unpaved roads and over trenches opened by the Gas and Water Companies; their wages for the year amounted to £377 12s. 5d. The sum of 21s. was also paid for watchman's wages. The companies contributed £78 14s. 1½d. for labour (exclusive of foreman's time) and £116 6s. 4§d. for material required in the said repairs. In consequence of the use of the Steam Roller the unpaved roads are, generally speaking, in a satisfactory condition. Those requiring attention are enumerated hereafter. STEAM ROAD ROLLER. The Steam Road Roller having been at work nearly 10 years, and requiring considerable repairs, the Vestry decided to replace it by a new one of improved design by Messrs. Aveling & Porter, Rochester, at the cost of £400, less £145 allowed for the old Roller taken in exchange. The new Roller arrived at the yard on the 9th of April. The Roller was at work 246 days during the past year, and about 12 men on average, under the direction of the road foreman, were employed in scoring, rolling, sweeping and watching the highways under repair. The amount expended in labour was £618 17s. 4d. The following Table gives the roads that have been rolled, together with the cost of same, and other details:— 53 LOCALITY. MATERIAL AND COST.

Gentlemen, During the past year 4,615 births—2,356 males and 2,259 females—and 2,287 deaths, were registered in this Parish. Deducting 460 deaths of non-residents, which occurred in the Public Institutions situated in this Parish, the death rate was 18.06 per 1,000 living—that is, 3.11 per 1,000 below the average of the last five years. Of the deaths in the Public Institutions— Residents. Non-Residents. There were in Shoreditch Infirmary 290 4 Hoxton House 6 58 North Eastern Hospital 25 87 Holborn Infirmary — 302 Convent Hospital — 9 321 460 86 The statistics below given show the rate of mortality in the different Registration Districts of the Parish:— Population.

There were 342 deaths from bronchitis, 227 from phthisis, and 132 from pneumonia, making a total of 701 deaths registered under the above headings as against 870 in the previous year; 703 deaths occurred under one year of age, against 931 in the previous year. The deaths under five years of age were 1,121 against 1,506 in the previous year. 363 deaths occurred of persons 65 years of age and upwards, as against 422 in the previous year, viz.:—213 from 65 to 75, 124 from 75 to 85, 26 from 85 to 95. In the previous year 217 persons died between 65 and 75 years of age, 114 from 75 to 85, and 26 from 85 to 95. In childhood (from 1 to 5 years) the largest number of deaths was caused by lung disease, comprising 136 from bronchitis, 81 from pneumonia, and 18 from congestion of the lungs, &c. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were atrophy and debility 152 deaths, convulsions 68, whooping cough 54, premature birth 64, and diarrhœa 84. From the age of 55 and upwards, 153 deaths were caused by bronchitis, 62 by heart disease, and 25 by paralysis; 87 were registered under the term of old age. 87 ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 373 deaths, viz.:—18 by scarlet fever, 14 by enteric, 17 by diphtheria, 105 by measles, 56 by whooping cough; 109 by diarrhœa; and 54 by other zymotic diseases. Of the 56 deaths from whooping cough, 16 occurred in infants under one year of age, and 25 in infants between one and two years of age. Of the 109 deaths from diarrhœa, 79 occurred in infants under two years of age. DISINFECTION.—This has been carefully attended to in all instances of infectious diseases. 150 houses were disinfected ; the infected rooms fumigated by sulphur, and subsequently the windows kept open to expose the rooms freely to the oxydising influence of the open air. The walls of the rooms, where necessary, were stripped and otherwise cleansed. At the disinfecting oven 1382 articles were disinfected. The Sanitary Officer, Inspector Lear, reports that he has been able to secure the removal of 96 of the infected sick to the Asylums, and that he has generally experienced little difficulty in obtaining their removal. Inspector Alexander reports that 1,142 premises were carefully inspected, and in 915, nuisances dangerous to health were found, and notices served requiring their abatement. An estimate of the value of the work done could be best obtained by fully considering the day-by-day proceedings which have occupied the Inspector's attention; this is briefly indicated in his report of the various improvements made to abate the ascertained nuisances that were dangerous to health. It is evidenced thereby that much has beeu done in the year to render dwellings more suitable for health. Some of the alterations were of a structural character. For instance, to remove damp and other dangerous conditions, 94 roofs were repaired, 492 drains were repaired or replaced, six cesspools were discovered in the year, and abolished. It may be 88 mentioned that cesspools have mostly been eradicated, but they are now and then still found. A great deal of attention has been given for several years past to securing the inhabitants improved closet accommodation, i.e., structures better fitted, more cleanly, and with proper water supply. 510 closets were thus cleansed and repaired, and water supply was restored or newly laid on in 571 closets. Much care has been taken to prevent sewage gases penetrating basement rooms and sleeping chambers ; and thus in 275 premises, the waste pipes of kitchen sinks were securely trapped, or their connection with the drain entirely cut off, and rain-water pipes have also been disconnected from the drains in 400 premises, to prevent sewer gas entering bedrooms. The yards of 416 premises have been paved to prevent dampness in houses, for it is indispensable for health to keep the earth under and around dwellings dry and sweet; for dryness promotes porousness and freshness, and by enabling air to circulate through the surface of the earth, disinfects it, by oxidation, and destroys any organic products that might accumulate and become poisonous. The labour and judgment bestowed on the inspection of premises, and in ascertaining in what way their arrangements are dangerous to health, is small compared with the energy and experience that has been given, and which must be given, day by day, to ensure that such dangerous conditions are removed. The inspection for that end must be searching and uncompromising, to prevent weak superficial work being done and passed by as sufficient; and to prevent worthless materials being used, which the inexperienced might allow, but which the trained mind of the sanitary officer cannot pass; for experience has shown that the conditions in such cases return and become more dangerous and troublesome than before. 89 THE BOARD SCHOOL, CURTAIN ROAD. In this School the difficulties experienced by the children and teachers in their daily work had become, owing to the structural defects of the building, so harassing that the Sanitary Officer was requested to visit the premises and report to your Vestry what alterations were needed to make the building more suitable for the purpose to which it is devoted. My attention was particularly called to the class rooms, in which the children were being taught at the time of my visit, and it was alleged that the light was so deficient that it was often difficult, or impossible for the children to see letters or to thread a needle. The cause was evident; there was little or no direct transmission of light from side to side of the rooms, or back to front. One of the rooms was much worse than the others; the transmission of light was intercepted by a partition or wall, so that objects before the eyes were rendered indistinct, owing to being partly covered by light and partly by shadow. Under these conditions the daily work of teachers and scholars had become exceedingly harassing, and I had no hesitation in advising your Vestry that such conditions were injurious to health; for protracted effort to see, with such inadequate light tended to dangerously interfere with brain function, and might culminate in vertigo, severe neuralgia, or more dangerous disturbances. It might from much evidence be said, that under the most favorable arrangements of a school-room, it is very injurious to daily strain the eyes of children, especially very young children, over letters; for the tendency of such a practice must be to render the eyes, and more especially young eyes, less adaptable, less ready and quiekin accommodating their functional arrangements to the purposes of life. A school-room should therefore be abundantly lighted from every side. My attention was further called to the fact that the children could not obtain water for drinking purposes, fresh from the 90 main, as is usual in the parish, for the water was passed through filters, which had not, it was said, been examined for some years. The closets also required much alteration. And I could not but observe that the infants' playground, situated under the school, has a very low ceiling, and is therefore very gloomy, and moreover exposed on one side to the open air; consequently in wet, windy weather it is dark and exceedingly draughty, owing to its exposure, and the lowness of the ceiling. It is manifest that of this school, the importance of a properly covered playground has not been sufficiently considered. Some minds might dispute the value of book learning to children, beyond reading for amusement; but probably no one would question the importance of encouraging children by playful exercises, to develope their limbs, and especially the ready, quick use of their hands, eyes and ears, and the free working, of all their senses; for such is the early course of development for the more serious work of after life. A covered playground should certainly therefore be bright, well lighted, and airy, and not exceedingly draughty, as in the instance referred to. Considering the various defects, to which I have referred, it was clear that this building was unfit for the purpose to which it was devoted, and moreover it was questionable if it could be made fit. Having reported that opinion to your Vestry, a copy of the Medical Officer's and of the Sanitary Inspector's Reports was forwarded to the School Board. After a while, and after repeated communications, some alterations were made by the direction of the Board, the defects of water supply and closet accommodation were removed; additional windows to supply more direct light were provided, but the rooms are still defectively lighted, and the playground remains as before. 91 THE RENOVATED HOUSES OF NEW STREET, SARAH STREET, ELIZA PLACE, AND DRYSDALE STREET. These cottages which have been extensively altered, repaired and cleansed, have been provided with new floors, new closets, and new drains, and the yards have been properly paved, indeed, so much have these dwellings been altered that, excepting the old bricks and woodwork, they may be said to have been renewed. Before these improvements were effected, the cottages were so dilapidated, that it was necessary to call the owner's attention to them, and urge him to make radical changes in their condition, as they had become unfit for human habitation. He had to determine whether he would demolish them all or partly reconstruct them. At the same time, the owner was required by order of the Vestry to close the 15 cottages of York Row, which cottages abutted on the rear of the small dwellings on one side of New Street, they also were unfit for habitation. These cottages the owner decided to pull down. That has been done, and the land remains vacant. Small cottages, such as those referred to as having been renovated, are much needed in Shoreditch; the parish being a large industrial centre, workmen's dwellings are much in demand, and especially dwellings that are suitable for one family; and, from a sanitary point of view, such cottages present many advantages in the simplicity which is secured in the sanitary arrangements and conveniences. It may be noted that the value of any structural convenience is in proportion to the simplicity of its arrangement, for simplicity is the result of a clear minded calculation of means to the end required. The calculation not only sees how things can be put together for the end in view, but kept continuously working together; and when any part becomes disordered, it can be readily repaired without dangerously interfering with the operations of the remaining parts. There is independence with dependence. And as the 92 commerce of a nation depends on the well-being of every individual, so the welfare of a city is dependent on the healthy arrangements of each dwelling. In health everything works easily and can be re-constituted if damaged; and such should be features of dwellings in large cities, for the larger the collection of houses, and the more complicated the social relations, the more singled and simplified should be the elementary arrangements and conveniences. Every house should have its own independent water supply, its own drainage, its own closet and other accessories. This independence has another great value; it tends to maintain family interest and family emulation, in other words, domestic life. Mothers and housekeepers generally take a pride in their dwellings, where it is practicable to keep such dwellings clean, attractive, and altogether in good order; and that promotes orderly feeling, and healthy desire in members of the family or household, and one family encourages by example another family, until it is commonly remarked that the street is well kept, and the community is justly pleased with the single and general respectability. These remarks your Medical Officer is called upon to make in considering the value of these improvements, and it is a pleasure to acknowledge that the owner of these houses has done his part to aid the health of the parish, and further it affords an opportunity of noticing what is the aim of the Sanitary Authority in its proceedings from year to year. INFECTIOUS DISEASES NOTIFICATION BILL. It has been the duty of the Medical Officer to report to your Vestry on two occasions in the past year, respecting the "Infectious Diseases Notification Bill," which, if enacted, would require that where an inmate of a dwelling is suffering from any one of the following diseases:—Small pox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas, scarlet fever, 93 typhus, typhoid fever, enteric, continued, relapsing fever, or puerperal fever, then the head of the family to which such invalid belongs, or the nearest relative of the patient, or, if there be no relative, the attendant on the infected person, or the occupier of the building, shall give notice thereof to the Medical Officer of Health of the district. And the Medical Attendant on the patient is required to certify that such a patient is suffering from an infectious disease, and in the certificate which he is required to send to the Medical Officer of Health, there must be stated the name of the patient, the disease, the address of the building, and the name of the head of the family, or other person personally liable to give notice to the Medical Officer of Health under the Act. For this certificate the Medical Attendant is to be paid halfa-crown. Every person responsible under this Act, and failing thereon to give notice or certificate, is liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. In my previous reports, as Medical Officer of Health, I had considered how the Act would be likely to work, I may again observe that this Act aims to prevent the spread of infectious disease, by making the Sanitary Authority acquainted with all cases of such disease, and so enabling the Medical Officer of Health to consider what measures must be taken to arrest its spread. Hitherto the difficulty has been to find out where infectious disease was present, until such cases have culminated and there has arisen a wide-spread epidemic. Whereas, if the early cases had been known, much might have been done to prevent very destructive outbursts. The operation of the proposed enactment would much increase the work of the Sanitary Department, for it would be necessary, on the receipt of a notification and certificate, for the 94 Sanitary officer to visit the dwelling, and direct what measures should be taken to prevent the spread of the infection, and to see that his instructions are carried out. In a large number of instances, where families are well to do, there will be the means to isolate the sick in some room available for that purpose; then it will only remain to ascertain if the premises are in a fair Sanitary condition, and when the patient has recovered, to see to the requisite disinfection of the room, and may be other parts of the dwelling, and to the disinfection of the infected articles. But with the poorer classes, especially in houses much crowded, and where there are two or more families in a house, it will often be as it has been in times past, necessary to procure the removal of infected persons to a sick asylum ; and usually, speaking of the majority of such instances, there has been little difficulty in inducing the relatives to allow their sick ones to be removed. In cases of very young children it is true that parents sometimes object to their removal, but it is very satisfactory to be able to say that in no instance, for several years past, has it been necessary to resort to compulsory proceedings by Magistrate's order. SCAVENGING*—This work has, during the past year, . required to be firmly supervised, and the neglect of the contractor has more than once been brought under the notice of the Vestry; and I venture to say advisedly, that in both the Sanitary and the Surveyor's Department, changes are needed to secure proper supervision of the Scavenging work in accordance with the requirements of this Parish. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. G. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health. 95 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. ST. LEONARD, SHOREDITCH. Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health, Sir, I beg to present the following report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendence during the year ended 25th March, 1889, showing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement.

MISCELLANEOUS. Overcrowding abated in 9 premises Dead body removed from 1 „ Animals, kept so as to be a nuisance, removed. , from 6 „ Accumulation of dung and rubbish removed from 8 „ Smoke nuisances abated in 2 „ In addition to the ordinary notices served for the abatement of nuisances, 478 letters have been written. To show the character of the work done during the year a few cases are given in detail, as follows:— CURTAIN ROAD BOARD SCHOOLS. Complaint having been made as to injurious conditions existing in the Curtain Road Board School, the premises were inspected, and it was found— 98 1st. That the class rooms were defectively lighted and ventilated. In several rooms the light was at one end only, and excepting on the brightest days, it was necessary to burn gas to enable the children to see at the other end. 2nd.' In all the rooms ventilators were fitted in the window boards, about the level of the children's heads. 3rd. The draught from the ventilators, and the evident strain upon the eyesight of the children, caused by the light striking obliquely upon their eyes, suggested to me an enquiry as to the health of the children, and I found in the girls' school on the day of my visit, five absentees were described as suffering from an affection of the eyes, one from stiff neck, three from colds, and one from sore throat. 4th. Immediately under a window in the girls' department were the closets of the infants' department, fitted with an ordinary iron trough, the emanations from which passed into the girls' class rooms. 5th. There are six flights of stone stairs leading to the girls' department, four of these were so dark that even when the sun was shining they were lighted with gas. 6th. The Curtain Road entrance for infants is a long passage rising with twenty-one broad steps to the level of the first floor; this passage is covered with glass, and the glass is covered with wirework, the glass therefore cannot, be cleaned and the passage is dark. 7th. The girls' and infants' playground is covered by the building; it receives some light from sashes, fitted in the arohes abutting on Curtain Road, and from the boys' playground at the rear. The whole area of the playground is something over 2,000 square yards; it is oovered with tar paving, and it is interseoted with very large brick piers; it is therefore a dark, dismal place. At the rear of this dark playground were three dark olosets and a dark urinal. 99 8th. There were three drinking fountains in the playgrounds, one for the infants, one for the girls and one for the boys; these were supplied from filters placed in the closets, and so close up to the ceiling as to preclude inspection; it was stated that the filters were fitted four years ago, and that nothing had been done to them since. It was therefore highly probable that the filtering medium was foul. A report setting forth these conditions was forwarded to the School Board, in response to which some windows were cut into the walls of the staircase leading to the girls' department. This gives a little additional light, which is obtained from the boys' staircase. Some other alterations were made but with very little result, and therefore further communications were addressed to the Board, with the result that the dark closets and urinals have been replaced with new ones built in the open air; additional windows have been introduced in the class rooms; nevertheless, several of the rooms continue very defectively lighted, and as the schools are overshadowed by high buildings on two sides, it does not seem possible that anything short of the removal of the buildings to the site occupied by the playground, at the rear, will ever seoure the due amount of light to the class rooms. DRYSDALE STREET (10 HOUSES), NEW STREET (28 houses), SARAH STREET (26 HOUSES), ELIZA PLACE (11 houses). The houses in Drysdale Street are 4-roomed cottages with small back yards. The other streets are cul-de-sacs, opening into Drysdale Street, and the houses are 2-roomed cottages with small back additions and small back yards. The lease of the whole of the houses reverted to the freeholder, a short time back; previous to which they were in the occupation of a large number of separate leaseholders, several of whom were widows, and all of whom were very poor, and quite unable, from the small margin of profit derived from their leases, to keep the houses in proper repair. The houses had, therefore, in the 100 expiring years of the leases, been allowed to show that they were worn out structures, and it was hoped that the freeholder would have taken them down and re-built them, when they came into his possession. Notices were served on the owner, setting forth the dilapidated condition of the premises, following upon which a consultation was hold with the owner and his surveyor. These gentlemen having decided not to re-build the cottages, finally accepted my suggestions for improving and repairing the property, and this has been done. The whole of the houses have been re-drained under my supervision in a proper manner. In the course of the works several very large cesspools were discovered closely adjoining some of the houses, the gases from which probably impregnated the atmosphere of the dwellings; the drains were of the most irregular and defective character, and thereby permitted the subsoil to bo soddened with sewage. The whole of the water closets which wore very dilapidated and foul were taken down, and rebuilt and fitted on my plan with open spaces under the seats, portland cement concrete floors, and flushing apparatus. The yards which were very defectively paved, and which contributed thereby to the soddened condition of the subsoil adjacent to the houses, have been paved all over in a solid manner with portland cement concrete, laid with slopes to gullies, specially prepared for the reception of surface drainage and household slops. This arrangement ensures the passage of rain and slops direct into the drain The subsoil has thus been allowed to become dry, and the back walls which freely absorbed the moisture which they previously stood amongst, have now become dry, tho supply of water to the foundation being prevented. Water, which in some of the houses, was stored in defective cisterns, is now supplied direct from tho main, by draw taps placed immediately over the yard gullies, 101 The dust-bins, which were of the ordinary defective and makeshift construction, were generally very dilapidated and foul; they have all been swept away, and three public receptacles of ray improved construction have been provided: this is a great benefit, as it obviates the necessity for storing refuse in small confined yards. The ground flooring rested upon the earth, and was generally much worn and broken. It was all removed, the ground dug out, and substantial new floors laid, and a good space under the floors provided to secure ventilation. The dilapidated hearth stones were all removed, and new ones of concrete provided, extending from the front to the back walls, and into the cupboards by the side of the chimney breasts. The solidness and cleanliness of this arrangement is highly appreciated by the tenants, who know the usual foul condition of such cupboards, with badly-fitted floor boarding, and odours rising from the earth. The defective flooring of the back additions has all been removed, and smooth, solid concrete floors provided throughout. The back additions of the ten houses on the west side of New Street were very small and dilapidated. They were all demolished, and re-built on my suggestion; and a waste piece of each yard added in, thereby enlarging the rooms by 4 feet. The wood cills of the back and front doorways were much worn and dilapidated, and therefore offered but little obstacle to water passing under or over them into the houses; they have all been removed, and solid and neatly-shaped concrete cills 18-inch wide have been substituted. The provision of these cills not only prevent dampness, they are noticeable for another effect. With few exceptions the cills, and the concrete floors of the w.c's also, are whitened every day by the tenants; and this external show of cleanliness is quite obviously operating on the habits of the people, and the interiors of their houses. The poor people who formerly were unable to make their cottages look decent are now able to do so, and they take pride in keeping their homes clean and respectable. 102 The transformation that has been wrought in these cottages was a long time in hand, and absorbed a great deal of my time, for though the work was done under contract by a good builder, it is quite certain that if I had not narrowly supervised every detail of the work, no one else would, and the result would not have been satisfactory. YORK ROW, Nos. 1 to 15. These dwellings were very small 2-roomed cottages, with very small back yards, and the whole fabric of the structures had become quite ruinous. Complaint was received from the freeholder as to their condition about three years back. The premises were then viewed by the Sanitary Committee, and it was ordered that some temporary works should be done, and that the freeholder be informed that the Committee recognised that the cottages were worn out and badly constructed, and relied upon his co-operation at the end of the expiring lease for their demolition. The lease having expired, an order was made upon the freeholder requiring him to close the houses, they having become unfit for habitation. It will be satisfactory to state that within a month the whole of the cottages were taken down and carted away. FELLOWS STREET MIDDLE CLASS SCHOOL. The site of this school is bounded by Fellows Street on the east, Appleby Street on the west, Dunloe Street on the south, by the girls' and infants' water closets and private houses on the north ; the boys' sohool abuts on Fellows Street, and the girls' school on Appleby Street. The play ground, water closets and urinals separate the two buildings. An inspection of the premises showed that several lavatory basins were directly connected with the drains, and also that several rain pipes were also directly connected into drains, the heads of which were thereby dangerous sewer ventilators. 103 The drains of the girls' and infants' water closets extended under the girls' school, and was connected into the sewer in Appleby Street; this was a pipe drain, but it was constructed in the most unskilful and defective manner throughout, and caused thereby the schoolroom to be impregnated with sewer gas. The various closets were fitted with iron troughs, and it was evident that no amount of care could prevent these troughs being abominably foul. The paving of the urinal attached to the infants' closets, and the paving also of the urinal attached to the boys' closets was very irregular, and thereby foul. The conditions were brought under the notice of the Committee of the School, who very readily adopted all my suggestions, and included them in the specification which they prepared for the improvement of their property, under which the defective drain passing under the girls' school was abolished, and the whole of the w.cs., urinals and surface drainage discharged through a new drain laid in the open playground into the sewer in Dunloe Street; this drain was fitted with a proper inspection chamber and interception trap. The foul iron troughs in the water closets were removed, and each closet was fitted on "The Shoreditch Model," with an ordinary hopper pan and trap, with an open space under the seat, and waste-preventer cisterns for flushing. The height of the seat and other details being carefully adapted for use by children. The school was built in 1840, and the foul dangerous conditions I have described appears to have been about equally due in their inception, to want of skill and care in workmanship, and to want of prevision in planning. The mistress of the girls' school was stricken with fever, and under her schoolroom laid the defective drain emitting sewer gas, which probably poisoned her blood, and it may well be, that very many of the children who have attended these schools have suffered in like manner, the cause being untraced and never suspected. This case is particularly referred to, because the Committee responsible for the conditions were not fully cognisant of the 104 dangers existing, and with every disposition individually to remedy the defects, when made known to them officially, would probably with the divided responsibilities of a Committee never have succeeded in obtaining such wholesome alterations as have been effected, without official intervention. This case is also particularly referred to, as in the provision of properly-fitted water closets, it shows in conjunction with the water closets of St. John's School, New North Road and Mintern Street Schools (also re-modelled) that water closet troughs, which compel (it may be delicate children) to inhale the fæcal emanations of a large number of other children, are out of date, and entirely without justification. The general condition of the water closets of these three schools, with the moderate attention given by the caretakers, proves that they are cleaner and more wholesome than the water closets of the majority of private houses.
