Printing Ditto ditto Ditto MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT For 1869. With Table of Causes of Death, &c. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, In accordance with the provisions of the Local Management Act, I hereby respectfully submit to you my Fourteenth Annual Report, for the year 1869. For tho more easy comparison of the details of this Report, with those of the Reports of former years, I shall adhere closely to the form hitherto adopted. The number of deaths which occurred from all causes, in the year 1869, was 1512. The average number of deaths for the last 10 years, was 1562; hence, the deaths were 50 less than the average. And the number of deaths in 1868, being 1644, tho deaths in 1869 were 132 less than those of the preceding year. In the table below, the numbers of deaths occurring in each of the last 10 years, are shown; and opposite to them are the numbers of births for the same years. Deaths. Births. 1860 1383 2279 1861 1494 2295 1862 1572 2287 1863 1609 2449 1864 1735 2224 1865 1613 2389 1866 1661 2434 1867 1497 2452 1868 1644 2478 1869 1512 2410 Average 1562 2369 It will also be seen that the births were 41 more than the average; but 68 less than the preceding year. The sub-districts in which the deaths and births occurred were as follows:— Deaths. Births. Excess. St. James 591 734. + 143. Amwell 302 612. + 310. Pentonville 255 487. + 232. Goswell 364 577. + 213. Every year a certain number of deaths of the inhabitants of this parish, takes place in General and Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums. The estimated number of these for the year 1869 is 110. The births being 2410, and the deaths 1512, the excess—or the natural increase of the population—amounted to 898. In the preceding year this was 834. 13 The number of deaths which, arose from all the zymotic diseases in 1869 was 370; that of the preceding year being 439; hence a diminution of 69. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in 1869, was 343 ; being a diminution of 51 from the number of last year. The number and causes of death from the principal zymotic diseases during the last 10 years are exhibited in the following table Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Diarrhoea. Typhus. In Hospital.

The number of deaths from all causes, in infants and children under 5 years of age, was 717; being less than that of 1868, when the deaths were 793. The deaths occurring at and above 60 were 294, including at and above 80. The numbers for the preceding year were 303 and 52. 251 deaths arose from pulmonary diseases ; the number lor the preceding year being 265. 14 The number of deaths occurring in the Workhouse was 140 ; the numbers for the preceding 10 years having been 120, 137, 160, 172, 158, 167, 174, 156, 186, and 178. 21 deaths took place in Corporation Buildings; the numbers for the preceding 2 years having been 14 and 26 respectively. 28 deaths occurred in the House of Correction; the number for 1868 being 23. 2 deaths took place in the House of Detention. The accidental deaths were 25 ; the number for 1868 being 23. 5 of them arose from fractures and contusions; 1 from a wound; 4 from burns and scalds; 1 from poison; and 14 from suffocation (13 of these in infants). 4 deaths arose from murder in infants ; 1 from manslaughter. 9 deaths arose from suicide, viz.: 3 from wounds; 1 from poison; and 5 from hanging. 116 inquests were held in the year, including 30 in the cases of deaths in the prisons; being an increase of 31 over the number for the preceding year. The table at the end of this Report contains an enumeration of the deaths, according to diseases and ages, in further detail. It is evident then, that the mortality of the year has suffered a reduction; not only generally, but especially in regard to the zymotic diseases. The principal disease which requires special notice is Scarlet Fever, which has prevailed in excess during the year. It is well known that it has lately been very prevalent in the Metropolis generally, having caused 5803 deaths in 1869, It leaves the old enemy—Typhus—quite in the background ; this malady having caused only 2414 deaths in the Metropolis during the year. And the proportion is even greater in this parish than in the Metropolis ; for our numbers are 116 Scarlet Fever against 44 Typhus. In the early part of the year, large numbers of hand bills were distributed throughout the parish, explaining the principal points to be attended to, in preventing the spread of the disease, the use of disinfectants, &c. And as is well known, the newspapers have given ample directions how to arrest the progress of this malady—as said— with care and certainty But the authors of these directions are mere dreamers, unacquainted with the habits and the dwellings of the poor, among which this disease spreads so readily and fatally. No doubt if the necessary requirements could be adopted, the spread of Scarlet Fever might certainly be affected. If the first suffering patient were isolated from others, all the clothes, secretions, &c., thoroughly disinfected before being removed from the room, and the attendants equally isolated, there would not be much trouble in the matter. But the poorer class live mostly in one or two rooms, the other rooms being occupied by families, even on the same floor. They will not allow the first affected to be sent away, and the remainder of 15 the family cannot in any way be separated or removed, so that the complaint spreads by infection, becomes distributed over the house, then over the court, and the unaffected children or those which have suffered mildly, going to school or playing with other children, spread it all over the .neighbourhood. Moreover, parents will not take any care, or adopt suitable precautions. They say " it is only Scarlet Fever." With Typhus, which I have shown is far less fatal, every care is usually taken ; the mere mention of the name is enough to frighten the parents and friends of patients into adopting the most important precautions, and the landlords into carrying out any sanitary improvements. If any real good is to be done in arresting the fearful mortality caused by this complaint, we must have Scarlet Fever Hospitals in every parish; and a law enforcing the removal of such cases as may be required. Moreover, the most rigid attention must be paid to ensure that no child belonging to a family, where Scarlet Fever is prevailing, shall attend school. As I pointed out years ago, schools are powerful agents in disseminating these infectious disorders, and when the new School Act comes into operation, ten times more care will be required than at present. All we can do now is to supply disinfectants to those who require them; and to see that no tenements where the disease has prevailed, are re-let until they have been fumigated and thoroughly purified. This is done. A very powerful check to the diffusion of this and other zymotic diseases, would be to have a piece of black cloth tied to the knocker of every house where those diseases exist; so that every one entering or leaving the house may be reminded that they are in danger of acquiring or distributing mortal disease. A black flag put out of the first-floor window, was used in 1854, when the cholera prevailed, with good effect. I should be very glad to see the walls of all rooms occupied in part or entirely as sleeping rooms, coloured in distemper. This could easily be cleaned and re-placed in case of infectious disease, and would afford no cover for vermin; in regard to both which respects, papered rooms are exceedingly objectionable. Lithographs and engravings are now so cheap, that a room can be made cheerful and ornamental by them, without the pattern of paper. Another serious point in regard to the diffusion of Scarlet Fe\er and other infectious diseases, is that the washing of the linen among the more well-to-do classes, is almost invariably "put out. ^ So that, wherever the infected clothes are taken to be washed, the diseases aio certain to be diffused. Again, when the clothes of a healthy fann y are sent to the wash, they are liable to be mixed with those impregnated with infectious disease, so that the clean clothes may easi y c on\ e} infection. Unless these domestic arrangements are entirely altered, and placed under supervision, we shall never material y ie uco t ie mortality from these diseases. 1G Ilclapfting Fever. In Novombor. a communication was rccoivod from tho Modicul Department of tho Privy Council, directing attention to the prevalence in tho Metropolis of lielapsing Fever. As a precautionary measuro, promises woro taken by tho Guardians of tho Poor, at Hampstead, and fittod up. But tho casos in this parish wore fow, or not rocognisod, and no doatlis woro registered as arising from that disoaso. As tho hospital was not found necossary, it was givon up. In regard to Small Pox, it is satisfactory to find that no doaths have occurred during the yoar. A Vaccination Inspector has been appointed, but as he has only held oflico for a portion of tho yoar, I cannot muko a roturn of tho Vaccination. I can say, liowovor, that ho is thoroughly olliciont, and that thoro is but little opposition to Vaccination in this parish. Two Vaccination Stations have boon arranged, at each of which a medical practitioner attends once a week. Slaughter-house. Thoso were inspectod as usual by tho Sanitary Committee and myself. They wero 38; tho butchers also being 38 in number. They wero in good condition, and defects in cementing, &c., wore ordered to be romediod. Cow-house. These wero also inspectod prior to issuing tho licences. They wero 32, kopt by 29 cow-keepers ; the number of cows being 326, which number is 64 loss than in tho proceding year. Somo complaints were made against these, and tho licences opposed until they wore remedied. Bakc-houses. Those were duly inspected by the Committee and mysolf. In no case was an infringement of tho Act discovered, and thoy were generally in good order. Artizans' Dwellings Act. In the spring of tho year I had to condemn several houses, as boing unlit for human habitation. Ono in Thomas Stroot was structurally dangorous, and was handod ovor to the care of the police. One tonoment in Albemarle Street, originally a workshop, placod in a very oonfinod looality, in the yard of tho house, I certainly considered very objectionable for a dwelling; but the Vestry did not think it necessary to intorfore. I also advised tho closing or destruction of several housos in the courts of Turnmill Stroot. Those have long been notorious for their sanitary dofocts, boing too closo together, in too confinod a locality, without proper wator-supply and privy accommodation. The courso laid down in tho Act was followed by tho Vostry in regard to theso housos; tho owners being summonod before the Vostry, and the proper noticos sorvod. Some of the houses havo since been pulled down and ro-built* ; others havo boen improved as rogards their sanitary defects; and in regard to tho romaindor, thoy may be said to be in hand. *1 logret to say, leaving tho Courts only from 4 to 8 feet wide. 17 Workshop Regulation Act. The persons engaged in workshops seem well acquainted with the powers of the law; hence we have had numerous cases of complaint of over.confinement, want of ventilation, &c. Although tho complaints are mostly anonymous, they have all been inquired into, and the employers warned, with sufficient effect; for we have not had repeated complaints from the same establishment. I believe the act is not evaded to anv material extent in the parish. Ihe Meteorology of the year was as follows: 1869. Temperature, mean. Difference from mean of 98 years. Dew Point. Humidity (Saturations! 00.) Height of Barometer. Eain in inches. Difference from average of 54 years.
