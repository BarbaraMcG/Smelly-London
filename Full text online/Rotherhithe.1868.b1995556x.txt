FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH. 18 6 9. During the past year the Vestry has held nineteen General and Special Meetings, and twenty Committee Meetings. Sewers Works. The following lengths of pipe, sewer and drain, have been laid, viz.:— 15-inch pipe 378 feet 12- „ „ 312 „ 9 „ „ 344 „ 6 „ „ 732 „ Total 1766 „ Twelve gulleys, 41 gratings, 26 drain-mouths, and one side entrance to sewer, have also been formed and constructed. 22 applications have been made to drain 57 houses and premises into sewers, the whole of which have been properly drained. 34 notices of intention to build and drain 59 new houses and premises in this parish have also been received, and the plans checked and approved by the Surveyor of Sewers. The combined drainage of the 33 houses, Clarehall - cottages and Clarehall- place, has been completed at the cost of the owners of the property. 14 A 15-inch pipe sewer, 142 feet long, has been laid by the Vestry in the rear of the houses on the east side of Princes-street, from Church-street to Princes-street-alley, in lieu of the old defective sewer there, and the several house-drains have been duly connected therewith. It being found on the digging out of the foundations for two new houses at the west end and north side of Portland-place, Deptford Lower-road, that the sewer there ran partly under the proposed site thereof, an arrangement was made with the owner of the property, who paid for its alteration and diversion by the laying of 198 feet of 15-inch pipe in the public way. Complaints having been constantly made of the nuisance arising from the portion of the Earl sewer in this parish remaining uncovered, the Vestry, in July, 1868, communicated with the Metropolitan Board of Works on the subject, since which a barrel sewer has been constructed by that Board in lieu of the open sewer, and the portion of the old channel complained of has been filled up. The Vestry having also called the attention of the Metropolitan Board of Works to the fact of the existing sewer ventilators not being sufficiently perfect to prevent the escape of effluvia, they received a reply, dated August, 1868, stating that the Board had lately appointed a Special Committee to consider as to the desirability of offering a premium for the best practicable plan by which the escape of injurious gases from the sewers could be prevented, and at the same time the safety of the men working in them be preserved. A 12-inch pipe sewer, 140 feet long, has been laid in Lucas-street, in lieu of a portion of the old high level sewer running through Christ Churchyard, which had dropped in. Paving Works. The following works have been done with new and old stone from March, 1868, to March, 1869:— New carriage-paving laid 80 tons. Old carriage-paving relaid 2065 yards. Carriage-paving redressed 80 yards super. New Kerb laid 350 feet run. Old Kerb relaid 2780 „ „ Old Kerb reworked 911 „ „ New York paving laid 1877 feet super. Old York paving relaid 14119 „ „ Ditto ditto refaced 355 „ „ York paving squared in stoneyard 400 „ „ 15 Materials used in repairing roads :— Broken Guernsey Granite 1795 cubic yards. Ditto Bombay stone 397 „ „ Ditto Common stone (various) 101 „ „ Gravel and Hoggin 248 „ „ Ground and stone carted 2763 loads. Blue has time 4 sacks. Grey stone lime 12 cubic yards. Portland cement 2 casks. Slop carted:— Parish roads 1714 yards. Main 3039 „ 1,723 feet of kerb has been laid during the year, viz.:—512 feet in Deptford Old Lowerroad, on the west side, opposite Midway-place; 79 feet at Westfield-terrace, and 1,132 feet on the east and west sides of Baltic-place, and the cost thereof debited to the Paving Loan Account The paving of the carriageway and footways, Union-road, and part of the carriageway, Deptford Lower-road, has been completed by the Contractor, (Mr. Thomas Turner), at a total cost of £9,461 17a.0d.; the excess over the amount of the Surveyor's estimate being caused by an extra length of carriage-paving having been laid at the Surrey Commercial Dock Entrance, Deptford Lower-road, and at Market-place, and by a larger quantity of concrete than estimated being found to be required as the work proceeded. In order to cover such additional expense the Vestry, with the consent of the Metropolitan Board of Works, obtained a further loan of £1,462 of Mr. Robert Lawrence, making together with the loan of £8,000 already obtained of that gentleman for the said works, the sum of £9,4G2, raised upon mortgage of the Paving and General Purposes Rates of this parish, such sum being repayable by twenty annual instalments, with interest at the rate of £5 per cent, per annum. The following are abstracts of the cost of Cleansing, Maintaining, Watering, &c., the Main Roads and Parish Roads for the years ending 25th March, 1868 and 1869 respectively, by which it will be seen that up to tho 25th March, 1869, although the carriageways, Unionroad, and Deptford Lower-road had then been paved only nine months, a decrease of nearly £1400 in the amount of expense for the Main Roads, under the heads of Cleansing and Material for Repairs had taken place as compared with the corresponding items for the year 1868, when the said carriageways were Macadamized. It may, however, be considered but right to take from such sum the amount paid on account of principal and interest, which would then leave a balance in favour of tho parish of nearly £500.

Bunning, in order to lessen the wear of the Rood, caused by the passage of heavy vehicles over that spot. The whole of the Iron Work of Plough Bridge was, in November last, painted by Mr. William Cracknell, under Contract, at a cost of £8 10s. By arrangement with the Surrey Commercial Dock Company the fence of the Dock premises at the corner of Trinity-street and Commercial Dock road has been set back, and the line of curb and footway re-arranged so as to render the curve in the road there more convenient for the carriage traffic. The Vestry, during the past year, have caused the removal, by the owners, of door steps projecting into the footway so as to be dangerous to passengers, at the following places, viz.:— at the east side of Cross-street, Deptford-road, at the side of No. 18, Brunswick terrace, and No. 1, Wynford-terrace, also at the north end of Yeoman-street, at the side of the house No. 2, Lake cottages, Plough-road. The owner of the houses Nos. 16, 18, 20, and 23, south side of Union-road, having given up to the parish the piece of ground forming the forecourts in front of the said houses, the Vestry paved the said space, and declared it to be from thenceforth a portion of the public highway. The Vestry having resolved to make up the carriageways and to pave the footways of the following new streets in this parish, viz:—Portland-place, Maynard-road, Wellingtonstreet, and William-street, entered into Contracts with Mr. George Rutty for the paving work, and Mr. Lewis Etheridge for the road work, and the same will be proceeded with forthwith, the cost of the work having been apportioned in the usual manner, viz :—the Owners of the houses in the streets to pay three-fourths, and the Vestry to bear the remaining one-fourth of such cost. The Vestry have also determined to pave the footways, Plough-road, so soon as the Main Sewers Works now in progress there are completed. The north footway, Manor-lane, is also about to be paved by the Vestry, and the cost of the work will bo apportioned amongst the Owners of the new property on that side of the street, the Vestry making their usual contribution of one-fourth towards such cost.

During the past year the following new lamps have been set up in this parish, viz.:—two in Commercial bock-road, between the Plough Public House and the Swing Bridge, one in Sarahs-plarce, Swan-lane (in lieu of the lamp formerly lighted under agreement with Mr. Blake, which has been discontinued), and one on the south side of Church-street, opposite Princes-street the contribution, formerly paid by the Vestry towards the lighting of the lamp over the Chemist's shop, at the comer of Princes-street, having been also discontinued ; one lamp has been removed from the east end of Portland-place, in consequence of the houses there having been taken down by the East London Railway Company, making the total number of lampa. lighted under the Contract with " The Surrey Consumers' Gas Company, 365, (for particulars of Contract, see page 8). 18 Complaints having been made of the inefficiency of the light given by the public lamps, more particularly by those situate in the eastern division of the parish, the Vestry in November, 1868, and again in January, 1869, caused the Directors of the Surrey Consumers' Gas Company to be written to on the subject, since which a number of the lamps have been supplied with new burners, and other alterations have been from time to time made thereto by the Company, which has caused the lighting of the parish generally to be more satisfactory. Cleansing, Watering, &c. The Contract with Mr. Joseph Parsons still continues for the supply of men, horses, and carts, at per day, for man, horse and cart, for the cartage of the cleansings from the Main Roads (after the same have been swept up by the labourers employed by the Vestry) to a shoot provided by the Vestry. Mr. Alfred Thomas Hobman is the Contractor for removing the cleansings from the streets, other than the Main Roads, for the general cartage of material; also for the supply of horses, harness, and drivers to the Vestry's Water Carts. Dusting Mr. Joseph Parsons is the Contractor for removing the dust, ashes, &c., from the dwellings of the inhabitants, and out of the parish, (for particulars of Contract, see page 8). Removal of Nuisances' Proceedings, &c. 147 notices have been served in duplicate, under the " Nuisances' Removal Act," upon complaints made by the Medical Officer of Health and Inspector of Nuisances, 41 of which have been effectually abated by the provision of proper drainage from the houses to covered sewers, and the remainder have been abated by the removal of the cause of the nuisance. Fifteen notices to make drains from dwelling houses to covered sewers, and 17 notices to provide proper ashpits and water supply to closets, have been served in duplicate by order of the Vestry, and the Owners of the property have, in each case, properly complied therewith. Fifteen notices were, in September last, received from Butchers and others, of their intention to apply to the Special Sessions for licenses for their Slaughter-houses, and the same having been severally inspected by the Medical Officer of Health, the Vestry opposed Mr. Spencer's application for his Slaughter-house, Seven Step Alley, in consequence of the complaints made of the nuisance arising therefrom by the boiling of offal, &c., on the premises, and the Magistrates accordingly refused to grant a license for the same; but the other 14 Slaughter-houses were all duly licensed as heretofore. The four cow houses, heretofore licensed in this parish, were, in October last, re-licensed by the Magistrates, there being no fresh application. 19 For further particulars, as to Sanitary matters, see the Medical Officer of Health's Annual Report hereto annexed, Appendix No. 1. Financial. The Sewers Loan of £800, borrowed by the Vestry of Mr. Samuel Brandon, at £5 per cent. per annum, still continues. £600 has been paid off the Paving Loan borrowed of Mr. J. W. Barrett, leaving £1,400 to be repaid by yearly instalments of £200 each, with interest at £5 per cent per annum. A Loan of £9,462 for Paving purposes has been borrowed of Mr. Robert Lawrence, of Ware, Herts, to be repaid by equal annual instalments, within a period of twenty years, with interest at £5 per cent. per annum. In order to meet the estimated expenses of paving the new streets hereinbefore mentioned, the proposed improvement, Jamaica Level, &c., the Vestry have resolved to borrow a further sum of £3,000 upon the security of the Paving and General Purposes Rates of this parish, and spread the repayment thereof over a period of twenty years. Charity Estates, &c. The Accounts of Messrs. John Bulmer and Robert Allen, the Churchwardens for the year 1868-69, have been Audited, and the following is a copy of the Charities account:— £ s. d' To Cash received from late Churchwardens 10 14 4 „ Plaistow Estate, 1 year's rent 25 7 0 ,, Stratford ,, ,, 71 13 4 ,, Smith's Charity 43 18 6 „ Bennett's Charity, received from the Guardians of Rotherhithe 9 0 0 ,, Hill and Bell's Charity, received from Church Rate 6 0 0 ,, Coat and Cloak Charity 6 0 0 Mrs. Embleton's Gift 5 0 10 Property tax returned 5 7 10 £183 1 10 c 2 20 By Cash paid for Bread, viz.:— £ s. d.

Edward Josselyn Beck, Rector, Messrs. John Bulmer, Robert Allen, George Bolton, James Clench, Edmond George Dannell, James Hurd, Edward Talbot, Edward James Talbot, Edward John Cox, Daniel Serle, Lieut.Col. James Payne, Messrs. James Robert Goodhew, William Caston, Junr., Richard French, James Henry Searle, Joseph Kelsey, William Henry Kelsey, William Matthew Marshall, George Houston Clark, William Burley, James John Stokes, and George Edwards Bulmer; and the following Gentlemen have, upon the recommendation of the Vestry, been likewise appointed additional Trustees of the Coal Wharf and premises by Church Stairs, Rotherhithe, in conjunction with the Rev. Edward Josselyn Beck, Robert Newham, James Arnold, and Benjamin Batt, the then surviving Trustees, viz.:—Messrs. John Bulmer, Robert Allen, Daniel Serle, Edmond George Dannell, Edward John Cox, Edward Talbot, William Matthew Marshall, James Hurd, and Lieut.-Col. James Payne. 21 Miscellaneous. The Vestry have completed the purchase, with Sir William Gomm, of the fee of the portion of the Millpond, Jamaica Level, required for the proposed improvement of the carriageway and east footway there, for the sum of £150, and it has been arranged with the Vestry of Bermondsey that this Vestry shall carry out the whole of the works with the exception of the road pulleys and drains, which will be provided and executed by the Vestry of Bermondsey, who have also agreed to contribute the sum of £275 towards the cost of the work, which is estimated at the sum of £1,547 5s. 7d. The Metropolitan Board of Works have been solicited to contribute towards the cost of the improvement, and so soon as thoir approval has been obtained thereto, the work will be executed by contract under the direction of a Committee appointed for that purpose by this Vestry. It has been likewise arranged that upon the completion of the improvement works, Jamaica Level, and upon the Vestry of Bermondsey properly making up the portion of the roadways hereinafter mentioned, now under their control, and agreeing to repair, cleanse and water the whole of the carriageway, West-lane, southward of Millpond-bridge, also the whole of the carriageway, Jamaica Level, to the entrance to " Southwark Park,'' then that this Vestry are to repair, cleanse and water the portion of the carriageway, Manor-road, north of Roseberry-street, to its junction with the Blue Anchor-road, together with the portion of the carriageway, Rotherhithe New-road, west of Hyson-road, to the boundary of the parish of Rotherhithe. Upon receiving a communication from the Metropolitan Board of Works as to an application made to that Board for their consent to the widening and extension of Glebe-road, Jamaica Level (Wing a road formed in 1846, which it was proposed should be extended northward to Slipper's-place, and southward to Hickling-street, and to be of the width of 20 feet only), the Vestry passed a resolution to the effect — "That the Metropolitan Board of Works be informed this Vestry were of opinion that such application should not be granted as they considered the formation or extension of streets of a less width than 40 feet to be highly objectionable," which resolution was duly forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works; that Board,however, ultimately granted the application upon condition that the new street be paved with York paving to the satisfaction of the Vestry, and that posts be placed at the east end of Glebe-road to prevent the passage of carriage traffic. The name of " Matsonstreet" was also approved by the Metropolitan Board of Works to be applied to the new street. The Metropolitan Board of Works have sanctioned the continuation southward of the return road out of Gomm-road, and the formation of a new road there, 40 feet in width, and approved of it being named '' Henwood-road ;" that Board have also sanctioned the re-ereetion of three cottages in Reed's Passage, Rotherhithe-street, upon condition that the passage in front of the intended cottages be widened to 20 feet from the centre of the old way. The Vestry caused a petition to be presented to the House of Commons against the '' Park Lane Improvement Bill," introduced by the Metropolitan Board of Works,and praying that enquiry might be made as to the practicability and advantage of the Scheme proposed by Mr. Henry Saxon Snell, of 36, Chancery Lane, for the improvement of the traffic at the southern end of Park Lane, Piccadilly, which scheme appeared to the Vestry to be likely to be attiendcd with less cost to the rate pavers of the Metropolis than if the plan of the Metropolitan Board of Works was authorized to be carried out 22 In conjunction with several other Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis, this Vestry petitioned the House of Commons against " The Artizans and Labourers Dwellings' Bill" during its progress through Parliament, with the view of having the same amended, so that the several Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis might be constituted the Local Authority for carrying out the provisions of the Act instead of the Metropolitan Board of Works, as originally proposed in the Bill. The Legislature ultimately passed the Act, as prayed by the Petitioners. In July, 1868, the Vestry passed a Resolution as follows, viz. :—'' Resolved that the " Metropolitan Board of Works be requested to introduce a Bill into the House of Commons, '' having for its object the extension of the time of payment of the Main Drainage Loan from " 40 to 60 years, and such a reduction of the three-penny Main Drainage Rate as the '' extended time will permit, and to invite the concurrence of the Mortgagees therein," and a copy of such Resolution having been forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works, a communication was received from the Clerk to the Board in reply, stating he was directed to acquaint the Vestry that the Metropolitan Board of Works did not consider it would be advisable to adopt the course suggested by the resolution. At the invitation of the Vestry of St. Pancras, Middlesex, this Vestry appointed Mr. Church warden Bulmer, Col. Payne, and Mr. E. G. Dannell, as a Deputation to meet the Members of other Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis in conference, to consider what could be done to prevent the further increase of Metropolitan Taxation, and a Meeting for that purpose was held at St. Pancras Vestry Hall, on the 25th of March last. The attention of the Vestry having been called to the increase of robberies, attended with violence, in the Streets of London, they, in December, 1868, appointed Mr. Churchwarden Bulmer and Messrs. Goodhew, Dannell, and Allen, to join a Deputation of the Members of several other of the Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis, who waited upon the Home Secretary on the subject, and urged that such beneficial changes might be introduced into the organization of the Police Force as to afford a reasonable guarantee for that protection and security of which London and its suburbs have long been deprived. A Memorial having been received fro m upwards of 40 Inhabitant Householders in the western division of this parish, complaining of the inefficient supply of water to their houses from the Mains of the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, the Vestry, in August last, presented a Memorial, under the 9th section of "The Metropolis Water Act," to the Board of Trade, setting forth such complaints, and urging the appointment of a competent person to enquire into the grounds thereof, with the view of having the same remedied, in consequence of which Capt. Tyler, R.E. attended and went through the parish with the Medical Officer of Health and the Engineer to the Water Company, after which inspection additional pipes were laid in Jamaica Level and Rotherhithe Branch Road, &c., which had the effect of remedying causes of complaint in some of the localities only. Upon the resignation by Mr. John Kelsey of the office of Surveyor of Payments, he was appointed Consulting Surveyor, at a Salary of £100 per annum, and Mr. Edward Thomas was elected Surveyor of Pavements at a Salary of £200 per annum. Mr. George Wells has also been appointed Clerk of the Works to the Surveyor of Sewers at a Salary of thirtyshillings per week. 23 The following alterations in the Clerks' Department have also been made, viz.:— The Clerk's Salary has been altered to £200 per annum. Mr. William Burley has been appointed Assistant Clerk to the Vestry, at a Salary of £120 per annum ; John R. Sutton has been appointed Copying Clerk, at a Salary of £30 per annum ; and the Vestry have arranged to pay a yearly rental of £25 for the use of the Offices at 61, Paradise-street. Messrs. Brass and Son, in lieu of extending their Wharf, Trinity-street, out about 90-feet into the River, as at first proposed, have built their new river wall only about three-feet beyond the original line of Wharfing, and have not in any manner interfered with the parish Rights of Way on either side thereof. Mr. James Naylor has completed his new Wharf, Rotherhithe-street, and continued the adjoining parish Right of Way out level with the same, to the satisfaction of the Vestry. In April last the Vestry caused notices to be served upon the Owners of certain of the waterside premises in this parish, to repair and heighten their Wharves and River Walls, to prevent inundation from the River ; they also, for the same purpose, caused the Wharfing and approaches to the Platform Stairs, King Stairs, Pageant's Stairs, the Right of Way, Trinitystreet (Laystall) and the Dog and Duck Stairs to be raised and repaired. APPENDIX No. 1. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, From 1st April, 1868, to 31st March, 1869, The Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen, The former annual report which I submitted to you, contained a brief and imperfect sketch of the progress of sanitary knowledge, and of the gradual development of legislation, having for its object the improvement of the public health ; since that period two enactments have been added to those already in existence, the Workshops Regulation Act, and an Act to provide better dwellings for Artizans and Labourers; in this locality these Acts of Parliament may not be often called into operation, but in some other districts their exercise may have a very beneficial influence. On the present occasion the statement I have to present to you is not quite so favorable as that for the former year, inasmuch as the births have diminished and the deaths increased ; the depression in some branches of trade may reasonably account for this undesirable condition of things; in prosperous times marriages are more numerous than when employment is scarce, 24 and want of employment brings with it many privations which predispose to disease, and induce some hopeless individuals to change the locality in which they have lived, or to emigrate. The diminution in the number of births is fifty-eight, and the increase in the number of deaths seventy-three; at first sight this account might cause ground for some uneasiness, but if we proceed farther in our examination of the matter, such a feeling, I think, may at once be dispelled from the mind; the depression of trade will probably account for the falling off in the number of births, and the increase in the number of deaths, does not place us in a worse position than the most healthy parishes in London, inasmuch as the death rate for the years 1867 and 1868 in this parish reached the unprecedently low point of 17.14 per thousand, and that with the augmented number of 1868 and 1869 it will not be more than 20 per thousand. In Rotherhithe there is a fixed population, consisting of the residents, and a moving population composed of Seamen, who are brought into it by their entry into the extensive Docks in this parish, persons occasionally employed in various kinds of labour, and the number is generally augmented by persons employed in executing some public work. We may consider the moveable class of persons as amounting to two-thousand, and the fixed inhabitants in the parish to twenty-seven thousand, the whole forming a population of twentynine thousand souls. The births registered during the year amounted to nine hundred and forty-nine, four hundred and eighty-nine males and four hundred and sixty females. The deaths registered, as the quarterly and annual tables annexed will show, amounted to five hundred and ninety-nine:— From April 1, 1868, to June 30, 1868 128 „ July 1, „ to Sept. 30, ,, 171 „ Oct. 1, „ to Dec. 31, „ 149 „ Jan. 1, 1869, to Mar. 31, 1869. 151 599 Coroner's Inquests were held on the bodies of forty persons, but nineteen of that number were not resident in the parish; this circumstance will reduce the actual number of deaths to five hundred and eighty. The births exceeded the deaths by three hundred and sixty-nine, and in the latter class was that of a female aged one hundred and one years. The rate of mortality, compared with the preceding two years will be seen below:— No. of deaths. Corrected mortality. Per thousand. From March, 1866, to March, 1867 621 600 21.12 1867, „ 1868 530 507 17.14 „ 1868, .. 1869 599 580 20.0 25 As it is desirable to ascertain the class of diseases which have increased the mortality in the parish, a reference to the tables annexed, compared with those of the year before, will prove that epidemic diseases have contributed forty-five deaths, diseases of the respiratory organs thirty-five, and disease of the heart twelve deaths in excess of the former year. Diarrhœa was fatal in 29 cases, all under two years of age, the high temperature of the summer months being the probable cause of the increase of the deaths from that disease. Whooping Cough was unusually prevalent, and caused twenty-nine deaths. Two hundred and ninety-nine deaths occurred under five years of age, forty-one from five to twenty, one hundred and fifteen from twenty to fifty, and one hundred and forty-four between fifty and one hundred and one years of age. Sanitary work has not diminished, various forms of nuisance having required the interference of the sanitary officer and myself; one hundred and forty-seven notices were served, which have all been attended to. The Slaughterhouses have been inspected from time to time, the majority are small, but apparently large enough for the wants of the occupiers; the slaughtering of animals at home appears to be diminishing, and butchers seem to be more inclined to buy dead meat. The condition of the premises inspected was satisfactory except in one instance; the slaughterhouse of Mr. Spencer was, on many occasions, in a dirty state, and used for improper purposes, which induced the Vestry to object to the renewal of his license, and the Magistrates at the sessions refused his application. During the year the Cowhouses have been visited, and no cause for complaint was in existence at the time of the inspection. The inspection of the Bakehouses was on the whole satisfactory ; as regards cleanliness, ventilation of the premises, and general order, they have improved. It is usual in the summer months to receive complaints of the short supply of water furnished by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company, the usual outcry was manifested this year, and some of the inhabitants were so dissatisfied, that a memorial was presented to the Vestry and forwarded to the Board of Trade on the subject; this course led to the inspection of several houses in the parish by Capt. Tyler, on the part of the Board of Trade, which process was followed by a speedy improvement in the supply of water, and a cessation of complaints for the season. A long standing nuisance has at length been brought to a termination by the covering of the Earl Sewer, in those parts where it travelled near human dwellings. My thanks are due to you for the assistance you have rendered me in the performance of my duties, and I am under obligations to my colleagues for their kind co-operation. Yours respectfully, SAMUEL TILLEY. Rotherhithe, September, 1869. D 26 TABLE OF THE MORTALITY IN ROTHERHITHE. First Quarter, from April 1st, 1868, to June 30th, 1868. Diseases.
