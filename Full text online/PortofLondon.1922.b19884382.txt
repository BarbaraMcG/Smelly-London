78. PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, To 31st December, 1922. Presented 14th June, 1923. REPORT, For the Year ended 31st December, 1922, OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE PORT OF LONDON. BY WILLOUGHBY MASON WILLOUGHBY, B.A., M.D., B.C., Cantab., D.P.H.Camb., Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. LONDON: Printed by Drake, Driver & Leaver, Ltd., Rosebery Avenue, E.C. 1. MOORE, Mayor. A Common Council holden in the Chamber of the Guildhall of the City of London, on Thursday, the 14th day of June, 1923. THE Port of London Sanitary Committee did this day deliver into this Court a Report in writing under their hands, of their proceedings, and submitting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the Port to the 31st December, 1922 ; which was read. Ordered, That the Report be printed, and a copy sent to every Member of this Court. BELL. To the Right Honourable the Lord, Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London in Common Council assembled. WE, whose names are hereunto subscribed, of your Port of London Sanitary Committee, to whom it has been referred to carry into execution the powers assigned to the Corporation, as the Port of London Sanitary Authority, beg to submit for the information of your Honourable Court the Annual Report of Dr. Willoughby Mason Willoughby, the Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London, for the year ended 31st December, 1922, which Report contains a full and detailed account of the work done in the Port during that period by the Medical Officers and Inspectors. The Report shows the extension of Port Sanitary influence to other diseases than those formerly comprised in the term " infectious." The increased list of vessels reported to have been fumigated abroad reflects the interest and effort aroused in checking rat transference. There is, however, no method at present by which the comparative efficiency of the various operations at various Ports can be judged at the Port of discharge, though so large an amount of fumigation must result in a lessening of the menace of plague and afford increased opportunity for a reduction of the rat population in Ports. 2 One rat plague infection was discovered in an entering vessel during the year ; the detection shows at once the necessity for a methodical scrutiny of ships from foreign Ports and the efficiency of the method adopted. The opening out of trade on the West Coast of Africa has resulted in malignant malaria in epidemic form on ships, a problem fully dealt with in the Report. A close scrutiny of the methods of hydrocyanic acid fumigation is being made in the Port with a view to determining their relative worth, and their efficiency as compared with sulphur dioxide methods. Food inspection and the Sanitary inspection of ships have been efficiently carried out by your Officers. An Account of Receipts and Expenditure in connection with the Port of London Sanitary Authority for the year ended the 31st March, 1923, is appended, in accordance with the Order of your Honourable Court, for the information of the Court. All which we submit to the judgment of this Honourable Court. Dated this 5th day of June, 1923. Leo Taylor. E. L. Laws. J. G. Howell. W. W. Green. W. Fortesque. Thos. Goldney. E. L. J. Durant. Edw.

TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1922. The total number of vessels medically inspected during the year was 925, and the total number of cases of illness reported to your Medical Officers was 530, of which number 33 cases were removed to Denton Hospital. Aliens arriving in the Port have been found to be clean, healthy and lousefree to a degree which compares very favourably with conditions which existed among them in former times. There was no large amount of infectious disease during the year amongst shipping entering the Port if the word infectious be read in the narrower sense. No case of smallpox was landed at Denton. One plague-infected ship was discovered on arrival. No cholera or typhus infection was introduced. On the other hand malaria in its more virulent form was prominent and is dealt with in this report. Influenza presents interest but usually as a misdiagnosis, or as a label for the catarrhal febricula. On one of the Training Ships recurrent cases of diphtheria have raised the question of the Schick Test ; much work is being done in the matter of this disease, and the test has elucidated many points of great practical bearing on the handling of an epidemic especially in schools. No infected rat has been found in the Port. The number bacteriologically examined has fallen below what is reasonably to be expected, but stress is to be laid on the absence of any mortality or morbidity ; these, being the earliest indication of plague infection among the rodents, are carefully watched for. The Port of London Authority are making such dispositions in the docks as must and do in a progressive manner lead to a condition of comparative freedom from the pest. Food and Sanitary inspections have been carried out in a satisfactory manner. The replacement of old tonnage by new has carried with it a distinct rise in the level of comfort and sanitation of crew's spaces on shipboard. The Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations is appended to this Report. TABLE I.—MEDICAL INSPECTION—GRAVESEND. From 1st January to 31st December, 1922. Jan. Feb.

" Warwickshire " were plague infected. On arrival at Gravesend on the 6th February, the chief officer of the vessel had reported that there were very few rats on board, and that no dead rats had been seen during the voyage and that the last time of fumigation of the vessel was August, 1921. The vessel lay at No. 22 shed in Tilbury Dock. No infection had been found on the ship or in dock here on discharge of part cargo. ss. " City of Genoa " arrived from Bombay via Dunkirk and Hull on the 23rd April, having called at the following places :— Suez 11th March, 1922. Port Said 12th March „ Gibraltar 20th March „ Plymouth 25th March „ Dunkirk 9th April „ Hull 11th April ,, Eight cases (3 fatal) of plague occurred on board, as follows :— 1. 7th March, 1922 Goanese butler. Died—buried at sea. 2. 11th March, ,, Native steward—landed Suez. 3/4. 12th Feb., ,, Pantry boy and deck boy—landed Port Said. 5/6. 16th March, ,, Topaze and curry cook—died same day. 7 /8. 8th April, ,, Deck boy and trimmer—landed Dunkirk. A native steward also died of pneumonia, about 16th March, 1922—buried at sea—said not to have been plague. The vessel's quarters were disinfected at Suez and Port Said, and the holds at Dunkirk. A complete and thorough fumigation, when the ship was empty, was carried out at Hull. 73 rats were reported to be found dead at Hull after fumigation. 9 Twenty-four dead rats were found during the discharge of cargo at Hull, previously to fumigation, and 23 were trapped alive. The vessel was under strict supervision in the East India Dock. I have already, in various directions, drawn attention to the danger associated with food stores on plague infected ships, and that the course followed by the epidemic on board has a close relation to these stores and food stocks in general. The illness in the issuer of the stores and his assistants, i.e., in those whose duties carry them into the store room is an indication of rat infection on the ship. Conversely in rat infections, the issuer of stores and his assistants are among the first persons to be infected and their duties put them in a position of danger. The cases on the "City of Genoa," and the circumstances under which the men affected lived, are additional evidence of the somewhat fixed course of spread of the disease in connection with foodstuffs on ships, through the inevitable attraction such food must afford to rats. The ratings and duties of the cases on this ship, as also the sequence in which infection occurred, are listed as follows :— 1. Goanese Butler 9th March. 2. Native Steward 11th ,, 3. Pantry Boy 12th ,, 4. Deck Boy 12th ,, 5. Topaze 16th ,, 6. Curry Cook 16th ,, 7. Deck Boy 8th April. 8. Trimmer 8th ,, Cases (1), (3) and (6) occurred in persons whose duties carried them definitely into the ship's general food stores, which are situated in the after peak and behind a watertight and rat proof bulkhead. These cases all lived above decks forward in the starboard forecastle alleyway, and are the only cases occurring in people who lived above decks. Cases (4) and (7) occurred in Tascars who were berthed in a lower forecastle ahead of the collision bulkhead. One of the cases was berthed in this lower forecastle in close proximity to the week's supply of provisions, ghee, rice, flour, etc., regularly issued to the Lascars. At the time of my visit to the ship, his empty berth was immediately over a spare berth in which lay part of the week's supply of food for the Lascar forecastle, the remainder of the food being stacked in a niche immediately alongside the berth. This stock was easily reached by rats by the companion way over deck. Case (8) occurred in a similar lower forecastle devoted to firemen. This forecastle, like the Lascar forecastle, lay athwartships, with this difference of note that it lay immediately behind the collision bulkhead. A similar practice of storage of a week's supply of food was in vogue in this forecastle. The berths of the cases were easily reached, however, by fleas or rats directly from the hold, through ventilation spaces over the bulkheads into the firemen's quarters and under the following more or less unusual circumstances. Cases (2) and (5) occurred below decks in the forecastle, one on each side of No. 1 hatchway below deck ; similarly to case (8) they were easily reached by rats and fleas from the cargo. The unusual circumstance was that in this voyage the vertical space between the No. 1 hatchway on deck and the No. 1 hatchway below decks leading to No. 1 hold was vertically wood battened so as to hold bags of linseed, i.e., the firemen's forecastle and the two stewards' forecastles one on each side of the hatchway vertically battened and piled with linseed, were open to attack directly from the rat attractive cargo ; in each of these forecastles one case occurred. It was definitely stated that prior to fumigation two dead rats were found in one of these three 'tween deck forecastles. Were the circumstances of plague infections as widely known in the shipping community as among Port Sanitary Authorities, the following inferences might at once have been made on the outbreak. It should have been inferred from the duties of the person first attacked that the ship was rat-plague infected and search made to ascertain the facts. I have no doubt ample proof would have then been forthcoming. BZ 10 It should have been inferred that to store food in the living quarters was to invite attack of the occupants by the disease, such storage being a direct attraction to rats. Without this storage there would probably have been no infection in the Lascar quarters. It should have been inferred that the position of the men in the quarters about the lower No. 1 hatchway, with its stack of linseed, was a dangerous one. The attention of the shipping company and Board of Trade was called to the conditions fostering the little epidemic, and measures which might have rendered the ship's community safe in the presence of a rat infection on board, were communicated to the shipping company as shown in the following letters. 26th April, 1922. The Secretary, Marine Department, Board of Trade. Sir, I beg to bring to your notice the practice on the ss. " City of Genoa," at present clearing for sea, and on other ships, of carrying a store (one or more) of provisions in the forecastles. The " City of Genoa " has at present a week's supply in each of the firemen's and sailors' forecastles. The practice is conducive to rat infestation, and in the case of rat-plague in the ship, to the spread of this disease (bubonic plague) amongst the crew through the attraction of infected rats and the liberation on death of their infected fleas in the crew's quarters. The " City of Genoa " already affords an instance of this not rare occurrence and sequence of circumstances, on her late voyage. I therefore report the practice for your information. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health . 26th April, 1922. Ellerman Lines, Ltd. Gentlemen, I have to bring to your notice the insanitary practice on the ss. " City of Genoa," at present clearing for sea, and on other ships, of carrying a store (one or more) of provisions in the various forecastles. The " City of Genoa " has at present a week's supply in each of the sailors' and firemen's forecastles. The practice is conducive to rat infestation and in the case of rat-plague in the ship to the spread of this disease (bubonic plague) amongst the crew through attraction of the infected rats and the liberation on death of their infected fleas in the crew's quarters. The ''City of Genoa'' already affords an instance of this, not rare occurrence and sequence of circumstances, on her late voyage. I would also bring to your notice that whenever a case of bubonic plague occurs amongst the crew in a person who is concerned in distribution or storage of foodstuffs on the ship, or who from time to time descends into the food store, it may be at once assumed that the store room contains infected rats and that the rats on the ship are plague infected. In rat infections the issuer of food stores is commonly the first man to be infected. This should at once be verified by search (dead rats will be found) and precautions taken to render all living quarters and store rooms rat-free pending complete discharge of cargo and disinfestation in a port. Twice a week, pending arrival, 1-lb. of sulphur to every 1,000 cubic feet of space should be burned in the crew's quarters and store rooms, the quarters being sealed on each occasion for six hours, so that rats or fleas contained may be destroyed. This, with the discontinuance of the objectionable and dangerous storage of food above alluded to, would render the living quarters temporarily safe even in the presence of a rat infection in the holds. I would suggest that these points be brought to the notice of the masters and surgeons on your vessels and ask your co-operation thus in the avoidance of unnecessary extension of the disease from rat to man on board your vessels trading with the East. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health. ss. " Porthia "—Plague.—This vessel left Rosario on October 24th and arrived in the Thames on Saturday, November 25th, with a cargo of grain in bag and bulk and a personnel of thirty-three men. A death which had occurred on the 21st November was declared, in answer to the customary questions, as due to Enteric Fever. 11 Close enquiry showed the following history. The patient, taken ill on the 15th, was in delirium almost from the first. A swelling appeared on the right side of the neck on the 18th and extended to the left side. Death took place without other signs on the 21st November. 'The sudden onset and the swelling in the neck (the apprentice was well at 9 a.m., and complaining and shivering at 11 a.m.) was suggestive of disease other than Enteric Fever and the ship was held at Gravesend. In prosecuting the enquiry, it was found that dead rats had been removed from the top of the cargo in holds 1 and 4 on the 23rd November, on an occasion of opening the hatches, and that dead rats had been thrown out from the bunkers and elsewhere since leaving Rosario. The two ship's cats, proven rat-hunters, had been taken ill previously to the illness of the apprentice. One of these presented a swelling in the neck which subsided, the other a swelling under the axilla which was said to be due to a fall down a bunker. Both cats had been thrown overboard. The diagnosis is obviously bubonic plague in cats, rats and one man. The ship was brought to in Gravesend Reach under the customary precautions, and the ship was discharged thoroughly fumigated and searched for the purpose of destroying all the rats on board, previously to entering dock or release from the isolation grounds. Due attention was paid to the rat conditions on ss. " Bradbourne," which is said to have been berthed alongside the " Porthia " in Rosario and was then due in the Port of Tondon. The ready detection of the infective state of the " Porthia " is an important and effective operation in the system of Medical Inspection carried out at the Port's entry under your Worshipful Committee. The further history is as follows :— A preliminary fumigation of the living quarters, which would render these reasonably safe for habitation, was carried out on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, 25th—27th November. No rats were killed in the after store-room by this fumigation. Cargo was discharged into lighters from the 29th November. The lighters were examined for traces of rats before loading. In nearly all cases the lighters were fumigated before loading. No rats were found on these craft, but the craft were customarily employed in transfer of grain. Lightermen and men employed in discharging the ship watched for rats during the process of discharge against transfer of these to the lighters from the ship. All craft were ordered to be clear of the vessel between sunset and sunrise. During the last stages of the discharge only, a few live rats were seen. No chance of transfer of rats to the lighters was possible. Discharge ended on December 14th. The cargo was bagged and bulk grain—chiefly bulk. Arrangements for fumigation having been completed beforehand, the fumigation of the holds began at 11 a.m. on the 15th December, before 1 p.m., Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 holds and the engine room, and before dark all closed spaces in the ship were under fumigation, and a deck search had been made without discovery of any rat. The usual turning out of the boats and search of hiding places above decks was thoroughly done. The cubic capacity of the ship under fumigation was 552,600 cubic feet. The quantity of sulphur used on the ship was 1,750 lbs.,and on the lighters 180 lbs. The prime cost of the disinfection was £55 10s. 2d., which amount has been repaid by the owners of the ship to the Authority. The engine room and stokehold were opened out first but could not be entered until 8 a.m. on December 15th. The hatches were opened at 9.30 a.m. on December 15th. The vessel left under sulphur fumes too dense to permit of examination of the holds. The total number of rats found during discharge and previous to fumigation was 92. 50 dead rats is the estimate of those found in the stokehold, bunkers and hatches during the voyage home. 10 were killed by fumigation in London. The results of the final fumigation are not to hand. 12 The distribution of rats found dead is as follows :—No. 1 hold, 76 ; No. 2, 7 ; No. 3, 1 ; No. 4, 6 ; Top bunker, 2 ; 54 of the 76 found in No. 1 hold were dead in the bilges and found on lifting the limbers. It is possible that these were imprisoned by the bulk grain on loading and died of carbon dioxide suffocation, the irrespirable gas being generated in the subtle respiratory process of the grain. The numbers found during the voyage in the stokehold and bunkers suggests the stokehold as watering place and that the hold spaces were not open to access by the rats by reason of bulk cargo. The other rats were mostly found in the 'tween decks to which access was possible through a moveable wooden bulkhead between the bunkers and 'tween decks. The deceased man was working in the bunkers a few days before he was taken ill. No suspicious rat of sufficient freedom from putrefaction for satisfactory bacteriological examination was discovered, so that the absolute diagnosis, by discovery of the plague bacillus, was not made. The clinical evidence of plague infection, however, was unequivocal. The history of the swellings in the neck of the patient and in a cat, the axillary swelling in another cat and the ample evidence of rat mortality formed a group of circumstances without other reasonable explanation than that of plague infection. ss. " Bradbourne " alleged to have lain near the " Porthia " in Rosario and bringing grain cargo to London was very carefully inspected during discharge in the port and no evidence of rat mortality whatever obtained. This vessel had been disinfected at Port Arthur, Texas, by means of cyanide in July, 1922. Three rats only were alleged to have been found as a result of that fumigation. Traces of rats were very scanty during the stay of the vessel in London (3rd to 9th December) during which a daily examination was made. Two rats were trapped and none found dead. TABLE VI.—Smallpox.

On the 25th January, a native cook was taken ill with symptoms suspicious of smallpox. Patient was landed at Suez on February 1st. A message received from Suez later stated that the case was regarded as varicella. Personal effects were landed with the patient, and the cooks and stewards' quarters were fumigated and washed down with disinfectant. All contacts were vaccinated. 13 The vessel was kept under observation while in the port, and left for Dunkirk on the 17th February, all well on board. ss. " Dongola " arrived from Shanghai on the 12th February. A native was landed at Singapore on January 12th, and one at Colombo on January 17th, with smallpox. Both were stated to be mild cases, and there was some difference of opinion as to diagnosis. All disinfection was carried out. The native crew were vaccinated. The vessel was kept under observation while in the port. ss. " Egypt " arrived from Shanghai on the 25th February. On the 17th January a curry cook was taken ill with smallpox and landed at Singapore on the 23rd January. A quartermaster was landed at Colombo on the 30th January, also suffering with smallpox. All the crew were vaccinated. Bedding was destroyed, and infected quarters on the vessel disinfected at Singapore and Colombo. ss. " Newby Hall " arrived from Shanghai on the 18th March. On the 7th January two cases of smallpox were landed at Yohohama. Crew's effects were landed and passed through the steam disinfector, all accommodation disinfected, and all the crew vaccinated. ss. " Nagoya " arrived from Kobe on the 28th March. On the 23rd February a deck steward was taken ill with symptoms of smallpox ; patient was isolated and landed at Colombo on the 27th February. Disinfection of infected quarters was carried out at Colombo. All infected articles removed ashore. General vaccination was carried out on board. A fatal case of " influenza " was also reported in the person of a head waiter. This man was in immediate contact with the smallpox case. This case was probably also smallpox. The symptoms of this fatal case were scarlatinform rash, hemorrhagic spots on the groins, high fever and backache. Patient died very quickly. ss. " Pyrrhus " arrived from Kobe on the 13th April. The second steward was landed at Shanghai on February 28th with smallpox. Vaccination and disinfection were carried out there. ss. " Glenavy " arrived from Dalny on the 19th April. On the 27th January the chief steward was taken ill at Shanghai with a mild attack of smallpox ; he was at once landed. All the crew were vaccinated at Shanghai, and the vessel disinfected. The patient was the only European member of the crew not protected by vaccination. No other case occurred. Your Medical Officer was called in consultation in a possible case of smallpox in the town of Gravesend on the 24th April. The case was not one of smallpox. In view of the possible connection with shipping in this case, and the opportunity of harmonious working, the occasion and its attendant responsibility were readily taken. ss. " Khiva " arrived from Yokohama on the 24th April. On the 3rd March a native steward was taken ill with headache and vomiting—rash out on the 5th March, typical mild variola (modified). Patient had been vaccinated six months previously. He was landed at Kobe on the 5th March. Vessel and hospital were fumigated and bedding, etc., landed at Kobe. 30 contacts were vaccinated— 3 successfully. No other cases occurred. ss. " " Morea " arrived from Bombay on the 26th May. On the 15th May a Goanese steward was landed at Port Said suffering from smallpox. Disinfection was carried out there. (A passenger suffering from chickenpox was also landed from this vessel at Plymouth). ss. " Plassy " arrived from Yokohama on the 20th June. On the 29th March the 4th engineer was landed at Yokohama with smallpox—moderate case. Effects were landed with the patient, and a general disinfection of the vessel carried out. 13 contacts were vaccinated. No fresh cases occurred. 14 ss. " La Paz " arrived from Africa on the 2nd August. On the 3rd July a wireless operator was taken ill with symptoms suspicious of smallpox, and was landed at Balboa on the 8th July. On the 7th July an assistant steward fainted and was also landed for observation as a case of suspected smallpox. All crew were vaccinated on the 8th July. Quarters on vessel were disinfected—effects landed with patients, and bedding destroyed. No fresh cases occurred. ss. " Clan Murray " arrived from Bombay on the 12th August. On April 5th, when vessel was en route for Fremantle, a case of smallpox occurred, and was landed there. All the crew were vaccinated and the vessel disinfected. No other case occurred.

Training Ship " Exmouth."—As formerly reported to your Worshipful Committee the disease diphtheria has seemed to be in excessive evidence on board the Training Ship " Exmouth " lying at Grays, and under the management of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. During the year out of some 800 boys dealt with there have been 30 cases in all. On the 23rd February, I wrote to the Medical Officer advising that a Schick test of the whole personnel would be an advantage. Some preliminary theoretical consideration of the present outlook on diphtheria is essential to a full understanding of the case of the "Exmouth," especially a consideration of the Schick test. 1. By its use one can definitely determine which person is susceptible and which insusceptible to diphtheria—that is, who in an epidemic may catch the disease and who certainly will not. 2. In connection with the test a means of rendering those who are susceptible to diphtheria insusceptible has been devised. It is one of inoculation with the poison in conjunction with its antidote. 3. Up to the time of the Schick test it has been customary where extreme care is taken to consider those persons, who present in their throats on swabbing a bacillus which is in form, culture and staining, the equivalent of the Klebs Loeffler bacillus, as suffering from or harbouring diphtheria. 4. Therefore the greater the amount of swabbing of throats and the more the pathological test of bacteriology is applied, the more apparent diphtheria is found. In passing I would note that the care taken of the boys on the " Exmouth " is excellent and the great resources of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, both pathological and hospital, always at hand. 5. It is found by the Schick test that real insusceptibles are apparent susceptibles according to the former pathological test. 6. A further test is now in use, namely, to determine by its capacity to render animals ill, the virulence of a suspected bacillus from a suspected sore throat. 16 7. This test shows that many cases which were formerly considered diphtheria, and treated precautionarily as such, are relatively harmless. 8. The antidote in true diphtheria is extremely effective if applied early in this disease. The care taken and the means of cure at hand are such that the disease is robbed of almost all its sting. If the repeated notifications are looked upon as possibly comprising many cases of no pathological significance (I have no right to look upon them so and would hesitate to make the suggestion) anxiety would be further relieved, but an undeserved stigma would still stand by the ship and a mort of worthless work be put in by way of disinfection and so forth. If the repeated notifications are not so read, then there is a diphtheritic state on the ship requiring every energy and resource available that it be put an end to. I have recommended that the Metropolitan Asylums Board be approached by your Worshipful Committee through the Town Clerk, urging a reconsideration forthwith of the application— 1. Of the Schick test and 2. Of its corollary—immunisation of susceptibles found. TABLE IX.—Enteric Fever (Typhoid and Paratyphoid). Date. Name of Vessel, Port of Registry and Official No. Where from.

Hunstanworth —Malaria.—This ship was extensively noted in the daily press. She arrived during the thick fog on the 16th November, at the mouth of the Medway from Rufisque, West Africa, and was unfortunately fog-bound. The whole of the crew were suffering from Subtertian (Malignant) Malaria, only about four men were really capable of work and some were in a very serious condition. Six of the most serious cases were received into Denton Hospital and brought under the curative influence of quinine, in one case only with difficulty. Dr. Watson, practising in Sheerness, took charge of the ship for Dr. Legge as far as the Port Sanitary Authority were legally concerned. Dr. Legge being conlined to his house by reason of a rather serious anginal condition. In accordance with precedent, which was agreed by your Worshipful Committee during the War, I have consented to the reception at Denton, of cases of malaria, which, as in the present instances, are in urgent need of being brought under the influence of quinine and shall issue to these on discharge a supply of the drug for the completion of their cure, defraying this last expense from the Samaritan Fund. The procedure in general has the approval of the Ministry of Health and of your Worshipful Committee. 21 MALARIA ENTERING THE PORT OF LONDON. The well-known malarial centres of East and West African Coasts and of India will afford instances of malaria which have occurred during the voyage on every incoming ship from ports situated therein. The questions have only to be pushed to arrive at the case, which is generally reported as " now well." On the other hand, many febricula are reported as " malaria " by way of definite diagnosis where definition is clearly impossible. " Malaria " and " Influenza " share the mis-diagnoses of febrile cases with " cold " and " chill." The definitely malarial invasions of a ship are mostly detected, and temporary cure of symptoms effected by means of quinine. The masters and stewards of ships which trade in infected regions are usually quick in detecting malaria, from long experience. This does not always apply where the protean forms of Subtertian Malaria are concerned, though in this disease quinine is usually given a successful trial on instinct. My impression is that the sea-faring community which goes into the tropics is far more infected than appears from any record. Many men now date their present attacks from the time of changing the gun at Dakar during the War. Illustrative Ships.—ss. " Hunstanworth " from Rufisque, West Africa, arrived at the mouth of the Medway on November 16th, 1922. The master declared eight cases of malaria, three of pneumonia and one of peritonitis. The ship left Rufisque on November 5th. The malaria came on after the ship had left Las Palmas. The crew of 24 was or had been ill to a man ; only about four men were fit to work the ship at the time of arrival. The ship had taken in cargo up river and among swamps. Four of the crew had been taken on in Las Palmas, these had there been in hospital, from another ship, which had also been at Rufisque; one of these four men subsequently came into Denton Hospital, had the subtertian parasite in his blood, and on entry was severely ill. The ship had proceeded to Rochester before details could be fully gleaned, but four men who were sent into Denton Hospital from Rochester, one with delirium, showed the subtertian parasite—ring forms only. The case of " peritonitis " (severe vomiting) died ; as also another. ss. " Hesione " from Bombay, arrived 4th December at Gravesend and reported 42 cases of Malaria as occurring when the ship was at Bombay, and subsequently up the Malabar Coast. The type does not seem to have been severe. The cases as they occurred were treated at various ports. The last case had occurred 15 days before arrival. The crew was free from fever, but several were anemic and below par on examination. The master reported a good deal of Malaria on Bombay ships. ss. " Chama " arrived 14th December. This ship had visited every port of importance in the Bight of Benin and was coasting from early in September. There were two cases of malaria on board on arrival and 6 cases in all had occurred. 5 grains of quinine was given daily to all hands from the 3rd September to the 20th November as a preventive measure. The ship was at Accra Secondee Axim and Sierra Leone after the latter date. The state of health of the crew appears to show the utility of the 5 grains administered. ss. " Hortensius " arrived from Beira at Rochester on July 21st. The report of " about 22 cases of Malaria, all well now," is suggestive of the light way in which the disease is viewed. A subsequent single notification of Malaria from the Seamen's Hospital, in a case which came from this ship on July 22nd, is at once a commentary on the report and a clear indication in one case of the condition of infection which possibly exists in nearly all the cases. 22 ss. " Caledonia " had 77 cases of " Influenza " during her voyage from Bombay between the 7th October and the 27th October, the latter date being the date of arrival. The number does not exhaust the list of infected persons. I have subsequent notifications from the ship and from the Seamen's Hospital. These notifications from the Seamen's Hospital of men taken there from the ship on arrival show that the subtertian parasite was in their blood. I have notice of two similar findings in two cases landed at Marseilles from the ship and a further notification on the 12th December, of a Benign Tertian case. The outbreak was almost entirely confined to those of the crew occupying quarters on the starboard side of the ship. The passengers were not affected. Most had " recovered " at the time of arrival. Those who were still ill were the cases notified as malaria and suggest, together with the fact that the starboard side of the ship was alongside the quay in Bombay, that the majority of the cases, if not all, were Malaria. Vomiting seems to have been a prominent symptom in the attacks. Malignant Malaria—subtertian—from India is not the commonest form. If this were an epidemic of subtertian malaria the mis-diagnosis on the ship points the rarity hitherto. It is an important subject for inquiry in Bombay. Malaria. Date. 1922. Name of Vessel.

Having occasion to lecture early in 1922, I made the following statement of opinion on the influenza epidemic which occurred during and after the war. The disease was the result of one, two, or three of the catarrhal bacteria acting alone or in concert. If the B. Influenzae were associated with the pneumococcus, " Trench Pneumonia," was the clinical type of average case ; if with the Streptococcus Haemolyticus the cases presented the signs of corpuscular destruction and ran a more acute course. Either of the infections alone in its most virulent form or in a non-reacting person was capable of causing death, much more so any two of them acting together. On the other hand, even a mixed infection in a person of natural immunity or resistance often produced only very mild symptoms, not even as great as attend a " cold." The bacteria of the infections became so commonly associated that, being passed from person to person by identical mode of infection, chiefly the " droplet," the association was very long in breaking and it became common that two diseases, sometimes three, ran concurrently in the same person. Whether true symbiosis occurred with an alteration of type and virulence due to the long continued association can only be a matter of conjecture. The association of the influenza bacillus with others is sufficient to explain every phenomenon I saw or read of in connection with the epidemic. The eventual world-wide distribution of the epidemic of this mixed infection had its source— 1. In the great aggregation of men. 2. In the world-wide dispersal of individuals who broke down under infection, into a number of small hospital centres. 3. In the removal of groups of the aggregate from place to place in the seat of war after infection in any group so moved had begun. In 1917, as its original name " trench pneumonia " implied, and before the influenzal element was found to be constant, influenza was a trench disease. Influenza is still rife in various parts of the world, but whether in the rather deadly associated form, I do not know. As a frequent and easy misdiagnosis in various diseases it is still of considerable interest in port work. ss. " Caledonia " arrived from Bombay on the 27th October, having had about 80 cases of " influenza " during the voyage, a few of whom were ill at the time of arrival. A curious feature of the outbreak was that it had been practically confined to those of the crew occupying quarters on the starboard side of the ship. d 24 At ports of call the medical enquiries had shown no reason for changing the diagnosis ; I was subsequently informed, however, that two cases which were landed into hospital at Marseilles had the malaria parasite in their blood. It was hoped that light would be thrown on the nature of the outbreak by examination of the cases from the ship in the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich. The illness, whatever its nature, was not one included among the dangerous infectious diseases, but the ship provisionally underwent a complete fumigation at the request of and by arrangement with the P. & O. Company. The clinically elusive nature of the various febrile and catarrhal states leads to a close scrutiny of the diagnosis " influenza " on arriving ships. It may be accepted for febrile states as an equivalent of the term eczema for skin conditions. From the too convenient generic term such a diagnosis as plague may be, and has in the past been made on close enquiry. In the case of the " Caledonia " there was a probable predominant element of malignant malaria. The parasite of malaria was found in each of the cases admitted to the Seamen's Hospital, and notification made to this Authority in due course. The curious distribution of the illness in the ship is probably associated with the position of the ship in dock at Bombay whereby access of mosquitoes to the starboard side was facilitated.

An Order of the Ministry of Health, dated the 10th August, 1922, is of interest to Port Sanitary Authorities in that " whereas the powers and duties conferred or imposed upon the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries under the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, relate as respects port sanitary districts and vessels, to matters affecting or incidental to the health of the people, and that it is expedient that the said powers and duties should be transferred to the Minister of Health." " On and after the date of this Order, the powers and duties of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries under the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, so far as they relate to the supervision of the administration and enforcement of that Act in any port sanitary district or in regard to vessels, shall be transferred to the Minister of Health." This is in conformity with the views of the Port Sanitary Authority with regard to rat control, which has been considered as a matter of health. It will be recollected that it was due to the work of your Worshipful Committee that Port Sanitary Authorities were included in the various orders relating to rats and the above enactment which followed on those orders. The dual control which formerly existed in rat administration is now by this order, in ports, consolidated in the single control of the Ministry of Health. TABLE XXIX.—Rat Fumigations (Home). Date.

Summary:— Number of Vessels Fumigated (including repeated voyages) 561 Lethal Gas used. Number of Fumigations. Sulphur dioxide 504 Hydrocyanic acid 72 Carbon dioxide 41 Formalin 2 Chlorine 1 Not known 43 663 In connection with the fumigation of the ss. " Kaikoura" on the 19th November, 22 hours after opening out of this vessel, the chief officer, accompanied by the relieving chief officer, entered the fore peak; both of these men were gassed, one being sent to hospital. The ship's boatswain had entered the fore peak for stores about an hour previously without ill-effects. The occurrence confirms theoretical considerations on the dangers of the cyanide process. The chief officer suffered from the effects for some weeks. The incident was brought to the notice of the disinfecting contractors. FUMIGATIONS. Up to 1922, no fumigation or disinfestation of ships has been done in the Port of Tondon except by means of sulphur dioxide gas. The minimum time allowed for the action of this gas with the destruction of rats in view is six hours. From its chemical constitution and behaviour the gas has certain destructive effects on moist tissues of any nature and from its physical property of higher specific gravity than air it is somewhat difficult to remove from a ship. The production of the gas by burning sulphur takes also some time for the development of a lethal atmosphere. 46 The gas is not immediately and directly poisonous in the tissues of any organism, its action being chemical reduction, irrespirability and direct irritation to mucous surfaces, which all require time for the development of lethal effect. Hydrocyanic acid gas, on the other hand, is swiftly lethal to organisms by almost immediate production of vitiating compounds with the protoplasmic radicles constituting the animal and vegetable cell or living unit. The gas is rapidly fatal to bugs, beetles, fleas, lice and mosquitoes and to some extent their progeny in any stage of development, to rodents—and to man. It is readily and rapidly produced by the addition of potassium or sodium cyanide to sulphuric acid in proportions per unit capacity which give a lethal percentage of gas in the atmosphere. It is practically non-destructive to tissues themselves, but only to their capacity for liveliness, does not attack metals, does not dull paint work, and does not discharge colours of fabrics, as does sulphur dioxide. It does kill the unskilful or careless operator and any person who for any reason, or for want of it, is not responsive to danger notices, flags or warnings of whatever nature. Your Medical Officer is, therefore, at once attracted to and repelled from the use of a gas of such lethal qualities, both in spite of and because of the practical results attained in various ports abroad and at home, where it is used as a fumigant on ships. The one great objection is the danger to man. The question of costs of the process to shipping is so intimately connected with the question of time (thus money) saved to be balanced against intrinsic cost, that I have no data for computation ; it is one for the shipping companies to decide. Your Medical Officer was approached by a firm which proposed to use the Hydrocyanic Gas fumigation in the Port of London with full precaution against danger to life of man. One or two scientific and practical questions were discussed, such as proof of clearance of the gas from the ship, its riddance from absorbtive insulating material and " pockets " before the ship which has been under fumigation is handed over to the crew. The main point of discussion was that of the certificate of efficiency issued by the Authority. I assured the representative of the proposers that, provided the well-known or the prescribed unit lethal quantities and methods were utilised, the Port Sanitary Authority would not hesitate to give a certificate in accordance with the facts of the fumigation, and affirming its efficiency as and when supervised by an officer of the Authority.

Implements.—Barrel, cask, or glazedware pot of size available for frothing, according to the magnitude of each operation, of stout material and good make, pitched within and without, with handles for convenience since the residue has to be removed and poured away. Wood tray for stand for each barrel, cask or pot. A hinged tip (with line attached for actuating) or other device for sliding in the cyanide such as a pulley centred over barrel or tube down which dissolved cyanide may be poured. A set of flaring danger notices, containing words such as " Deadly Poison," " Prussic Acid," " Fatal to go on Board," " Fumes," in prominence. A very authoritative officer at the shore end of one and only gangway. A set of certificates for responsible people to sign to the effect that this, that and every gang has been counted out of the ship before producing the gas. A set of oxygen respirators with bottle, pressure gauge, valves, straps, breathing bag, nose clips, etc., for complete exclusion of the wearers' lungs from the outside world and affording an alternative atmosphere. Cotton wool nose and mouth pads for the gang which mixes sulphuric acid and water in the barrels. Hydrogen peroxide and ether, with injection syringe, for use in rescue work in case of accident. Two or three live small animals as safety indicators. Procedure.—Warning notices are prominently displayed conveying the time after which it will be fatal to be on board. The ship is systematically prepared for sealing, unsealing and wind sail ventilation, and is sealed as far as is possible at this stage. The apparatus is suitably distributed. The acid and water are mixed in each vessel in accordance with pre-arranged tabulation of spaces and quantities for each portion of the operation. The personnel is cleared from the ship and watchmen posted at gangway. The cyanide is weighed and distributed in convenient proximity to the acid containers in the various holds and quarters. The working gang is cleared from the ship after seeing that running tackle is placed and carried to the wharf for opening out the hold covers, and the signatures of those responsible for clearance of personnel are taken. The responsible operators (skilled men) place the cyanide in position and set the apparatus " at full cock." These operators don the oxygen apparatus and set the lesser cocks in operation in small quarters and finally seal these quarters and the holds. Then finally " pull off " and leave the ship. The ship is now deserted and under fumigation. G 48 The watchman at the gangway is challenged and repeats his orders. The warning notice is changed to show the present extreme danger. A two-hour period for action of the gas is allowed. Opening Out.—The skilled operators pull away the tarpaulins from the hatches by means of the previously arranged quay ropes. They don the oxygen apparatus and open out, as far as can be readily done, all sealed spaces and set the windsails in the larger spaces. An interval of 2 hours is allowed. The operators again don the oxygen apparatus and search the ship for residual fumes, each operator having with him a live animal as indicator. They declare the ship free for the crew to board. The apparatus is removed and emptied of residues. Comment.—The operation is fraught with danger throughout. The apparatus and care needed are excessive in comparison with the result aimed at, if this be killing of rats. This excess is proportional to the excessive demand of 3 lbs. to the 1,000 c. ft. which has made the sulphur method somewhat destructive, especially in upperworks, and has thus chiefly raised the question of HCN as an alternative. 3 lbs. of sulphur burned in one thousand cubic feet is demanded ; this is three times the necessary amount for rat killing in a well conducted operation and is more than three times as destructive to paintwork, etc. On its merits, sulphur reasonably used will continue as the prime fumigant. The necessity for a close preparation of the ship is the same in both sulphur and cyanide fumigation; success in either is proportional to the care taken in preparation. TABLE XXX.—Hospital.

FOOD INSPECTION. The Regulations issued by the Local Government Board (now the Ministry of Health) under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, were carried out in the Port of London, and resulted in 3,989 tons 12 cwts. 2 qrs. 3 lbs. of Unsound Food being destroyed or disposed of in such a manner as to prevent it being used for human consumption. Exceptions are shown in the disposal of some of the goods for the manufacture of confectionery, distillation, refining and by exportation. The goods for the manufacture of confectionery were condensed milk, which had either undergone a yeast fermentation or had been returned to this country owing to " caramelisation " and discolouration. The deleterious qualities were removed in the process of remanufacture, and thus the use of a considerable quantity of valuable food material was retained. The goods for distillation consist usually of dried fruits, e.g., dates, prunes, raisins and sultanas, and the material disposed of for the purposes of refining comprised damaged sugar and loose sugar swept up from the floors of warehouses, etc. Disposal of the material was carried out as follows, only those goods which could not be used for some useful purpose being actually destroyed.

The largest quantity seized ex any vessel was 303 quarters, weighing 20 tons 1 cwt. 3 qrs. 12 lbs., the condemnation being due to leaky brine pipes in the refrigerating holds. Mutton.—The total quantity of frozen mutton seized by your officers and disposed of as unfit for human consumption was 2,423 carcases, 1,032 pieces, 4 bags and a quantity of trimmings, the total weight being 52 tons 11 cwts. 2 qrs. 2 lbs., against 267 tons 6 cwts. 2 qrs. 3 lbs., in the preceding year. The largest quantity seized ex any vessel was 716 carcases, weighing 14 tons 10 cwts. 2 qrs. 7 lbs. 52 Actinomycosis in Ox-Tongues.—Most of the ox-tongues which arrived in the Port of London were, at the request of the consignees, removed from the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority (without inspection) to cold stores within the City of London, the Metropolitan Boroughs of Bermondsey, Finsbury and Southwark, to be examined there under the supervision of the Medical Officers of Health of those districts. About 86 separate consignments were put into cold store within the district of the Port Sanitary Authority, where the tongues, totalling 22,521, were thawed out and carefully examined and 338, equalling 1.50 per cent., found to be affected with Actinomycosis. The consignments showing upwards of 2 per cent, diseased were as follows:— Number of tongues examined. Number found diseased.

Pork.—During the year a careful examination was made of a percentage of all consignments of pig-carcases landed within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, and resulted in a detailed examination of 18,867 carcases, of which 131, equalling .69 per cent., were found to be affected with tuberculosis. Altogether 150 separate consignments were examined and of those the following showed upwards of 2 per cent. to be affected with tuberculosis:— From. Number of carcases examined.

During the early part of the year the attention of your Medical Officer was called to large quantities of condensed milk of a well-known brand, which were being discharged within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority from Rotterdam. The milk was reported to have been sold on the Continent several years previously to Germany, and was re-shipped to this country via Rotterdam. The milk was found to have been manufactured in Australia, Canada, America and other countries, and apart from the fact that a few of the tins were "blown," to outward appearance the milk appeared to be in good condition, but on internal examination a considerable quantity of the milk showed signs of age, inasmuch as it was lumpy and fermenting and, as the tins bore labels specially commending the milk for feeding infants, it was deemed advisable to place the goods under detention for careful detailed examination. The following consignments were dealt with:— Number of cases Number of cases detained and examined. rejected as unsound, 8,000 1,657 2,705 790 100 91 1,781 108 2,271 757 Total 14,857 3,403 = 22.23 per cent. The milk rejected as unsound was graded and the better portion released under guarantee for the manufacture of confectionery, the remainder being released, also under guarantee, for cattle and poultry feeding. During the year, the undermentioned foodstuff was submitted for bacteriological examination and reported upon as follows:— Corned beef Sterile. During the year, the following foodstuffs were submitted to the Analyst, who reported as follows:— Tinned Tomato Sauce *Contained 6.83 grains per pound of tin.

During the year it came to the notice of your Medical Officer that a considerable business was being carried on in what are known as " sugar sweepings," which consist of loose sugar swept up from the floors of dock warehouses and other places. As these sweepings contain a considerable quantity of dirty extraneous matter (frequently as much as 25 per cent.), and could be disposed of for making low grade jam and sweets or mixing with larger quantities of clean sugar and so escape notice, your Medical Officer had them placed under detention and only released on a written guarantee being given to your Medical Officer that they would be taken to addresses specified in the guarantees and there submitted to a satisfactory process of refining, such guarantees being signed by the persons carrying out the process of refining? In all cases of sugar sweepings being released for refining, the Medical Officers of Health of the districts in which the refining was to be carried out, were furnished with the necessary particulars. The total quantity of this material released during the year for the purpose of refining was 355 tons 3 cwts. 1 qr. 26 lbs. During the year applications were received from Importers to be allowed to remove various foodstuffs from the district of the Port of London without examination by your officers, on the understanding that the goods would be examined and dealt with under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health of the district to which the goods were removed. The permission asked for was given in respect of the following foodstuffs For removal to the City of London:— 8,972 bags and cases of ox-tongues. 6,106 carcases of mutton. 3,120 quarters of beef. 698 packages of frozen sundries. 1 crate of rabbits. 1,131 cases of frozen salmon.

The nuisance can be obviated by the preservation of such a head of steam in a boiler of an oil burning vessel during the stay in dock as shall permit of the use of forced draught during the process of raising steam for sailing. A prosecution in the case of an offender would have salutary effect. The nuisance clauses of the Public Health Act require that an " Intimation " be served ; by the time the offender receives this, steam is raised and the nuisance abated not to recur in this Port on the same ship perhaps for years. OIL SMELL NUISANCE AT THAMESHAVEN. Dr. Bullough, M.O.H. Essex County Council, was in communication with me in the matter of offensive smells in the Thameshaven district. On the 19th April I met Dr. Pugh, M.O.H. for Southend, and Dr. Bullough, and we proceeded to Thameshaven, where the oil works are situated. It appeared certain that there was no other source of the nuisance complained of than oil. Crude oil has long been dealt with in bulk for distribution at Thameshaven and the complaints were recent. This trade is not a likely source of the nuisance. Of recent years discharge of light oils and refinement of crude oil has been undertaken at Thameshaven. The process of refinement consists of a heat distillation of crude oil and condensation and successive collection of the lighter and vapourisable products, namely, benzenes and paraffins. In this process still lighter vapours are driven off—gases, which while heavy in comparison with air, do not condense and would disturb the orderly flow of the condensing light oils in the pipes, unless vented. These gases are vented, stink complexly in conformity with their chemical constitution and hang together in the air by reason of their relative weight. The possible sources of the nuisance are:— 1. The ventilation of tank ships on discharge of light or heavy oils. 2. The venting of gases from empty tanks in the process of filling with these oils. 3. The venting of gases from the condensation pipes during the distillation process. 4. The emptying of residues into and from lighters in the process of dumping. The third and fourth sources are probably the ones to which complaint is due, and the problem of removal of the nuisance is that of burning the gases, or of dissipating them in the atmosphere, so that they are not swept over the surrounding district " en masse " whenever the barometric and wind conditions become adjuvant to such mass distribution and the careful disposal of residues far out to sea. From time to time your Worshipful Committee has in the past received complaints of oil floating on the surface of the river. This has not been considered to be a nuisance of that particular biological flavour which is covered by the nuisance clauses of the Public Health Act. The Port of London Authority has a successful barge and apparatus at work for fractional separation of oil and water ; this obviates the difficulty which formerly arose on cleansing the tanks of oil vessels after discharge. The nuisance most bitterly complained of, however, is hardly touched by the recent enactment ; it is that of a line of thick oil or oil in patches which may drift ashore at seaside bathing resorts from miles out at sea, plastering or spotting the foreshore with soft and tenacious tar. The nuisance is common to Shoeburyness and the remote Cornish Coast in your Medical Officer's observation, and its origin is probably the bilges of oil fuel burning ships rather than the tanks of the carrier. The Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1922, is intended to control nuisance whether arising from ashore or from a ship where oil is discharged or allowed to escape negligently. The maximum fine is £100. The discharge of oil is limited to daylight hours, unless notice has been given. 61 Records of discharge of oil from ship to shore or from ship to ship are to be kept and to be subject to an inspection authorised by the Board of Trade or the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. Tank washings are deemed to be oil. The Board of Trade may appoint inspectors who shall have powers of entry for inspection. A Port Sanitary Authority represents its complaint, if any, to the Board of Trade. By amendment of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, proceedings in Summary Jurisdiction against a master of a vessel may be instituted up to two months after the date on which he returns to Great Britain or Northern Ireland from a voyage which succeeds an alleged offence, notwithstanding the date of such alleged offence. * Proceedings in respect of an offence committed in a harbour are taken by the Harbour Authority and otherwise only by persons specially authorised by the Board of Trade or the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. The expression " vessel " means any description of vessel which is constructed and fitted to carry in bulk, whether as cargo or for bunker purposes, more than five tons of oil in any one space or container. The waters to which this Act applies are the territorial waters of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the waters of harbours therein. HOUSE BOATS IN LEIGH CREEK. In 1921, the Borough of Southend, through Dr. Pugh, the Medical Officer of Health, complained of a nuisance arising upon the foreshore at Leigh from the numerous boats of classes varying from the laid up yacht to the barge or bawley boat with a wooden structure erected thereon, which are used entirely as human habitations. At a place which is in vogue as a seaside resort, such conditions as might arise from the throwing overboard of filth, ashes and refuse are a potential nuisance ; the more particularly is this so from the fact that all the boats complained of lie on mud from which all water has receded with the tides for the greater part of the twenty-four hours, and are lodged as close to the high water line as possible for convenience to the boat population in getting ashore. The nuisance found from time to time is not glaring but potentially so and cumulative. The situation of most of the boats is in the Eastward angle between Leigh Island and the Leigh foreshore at the mouth of the narrow high tide waterway separating these places. The foreshore rights at this point are owned by the Salvation Army. Removal of the boats is the cure of the nuisance. The boats as residences are not unhealthy as habitations up to the point of securing closure ; moreover, the difficulties of housing are such that a rather wretched lodging in them can command 25s. per week as rent. Regulation under the nuisance clauses of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, is difficult and implies a recognition of the type of undesirable dwelling ; in the difficulty it seems more satisfactory that the regulations which may be enforced in connection with tents, vans and similar structures used for human habitation should be applied directly to these " similar structures," which are neither on the water nor on land, but which menace amenities and public health in much the same way as would a van taking up a permanent position were there no sanitary provision governing its stay. The possibility of extending the bye-laws to the Port Sanitary Authority is under consideration by the Ministry of Health. TABLE XXXVI.—SANITARY WORKS. Part I. Date completed. 1922. Works.

The type of immigrant is good as regards health. Immigrants are for the most part of good class, traders or persons arriving to take up situations previously arranged for. The transmigrants, who are examined under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, have proved conspicuously clean and free from vermin as compared with their pre-war condition on landing. This is due to stringent precaution taken before embarkation on the continent in view of typhus prevention. The cleanliness extends to their clothing and effects also. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Emanuel Smith, of Brentford, was summoned on the 7th April in respect of infringements of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations on the canal boat "Lucy"; defendant was convicted and fined 10s. in each case with costs. Summonses were applied for in the following cases:— Name of Vessel. Offence. ss. " Newlands," arrived at Gravesend, 4th Oct., 1922 The Master did not furnish the Sanitary Authority and the Medical Officer of Health with all such information as may be reasonably required by them for the purpose of the Port Sanitary Authorities (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1920. ss. " Mackinaw," arrived Gravesend, 2nd Nov., 1922 Note.—By Section I. (3) of the Public Health Act, 1896, any person who wilfully neglects or refuses to obey or carry out, or obstructs the execution of any regulation made under Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, or under that Section as extended to London by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or as amended by the Public Health Act, 1896, is liable to a penalty not exceeding one hundred pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty not exceeding fifty pounds for every day during which the offence continues. Smallpox and Enteric Fever were the diseases not duly declared. The offence charged against the master was in each case found in par. 6 (b) of the Port Sanitary Authorities (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1920. Fines imposed were respectively £50 and £10 and costs 2 guineas. NEW OFFICES. The new offices at 5, Church Passage, Guildhall, were occupied on the 20th November. UNIFORMS. In March it was recommended, and ordered, 1. That uniforms consisting of a blue serge suit without brass buttons be worn by the Food Inspectors ; the disuse of the official cap to be by permission of your Medical Officer. 2. That uniforms consisting of a blue serge suit with buttons and official cap be worn by the Sanitary Inspectors on all occasions while on dutv. I 64 NEW MOTOR LAUNCH. An order was placed for a new 42 ft. petrol paraffin launch, in November. LAUNCHES AND HULKS. " David Burnett."—This launch was sold to the Boston Dock and Harbour Commissioners at the price of £400. Hulk " Hygeia."—The new hulk " Hygeia " came into use by the Medical Officers at Gravesend on the 27th January. Mr. Howlett, of Gravesend, agreed to take over the old hulk " Hygeia " at a premium of £35. The replacement of the former hulk has been a successful venture hitherto. No sign of serious leakage has occurred and the thorough survey of the skin of the vessel, possible as she lay on the stocks, gives promise of a prolonged utility without serious outlay on this craft. The question of " ship worm " was raised in connection with the former craft. Your Medical Officer had previously worked out the upper limit of this seriously destructive agent in the Thames and showed that the precaution of sheathing was unnecessary. The " worm " Teredo, a bi-valve boring mollusc, exists plentifully at the Mucking, ekes out a precarious existence at the level of Denton Hospital and is not found at the level of the New Bridge or " Hygeia " moorings. It is probable that the embryo finds a lodgment as high up as Gravesend from time to time. The factors in elimination of the worm are, first, the fresh water coming down at times of spate when the specific gravity may fall as low as practically 1,000 at low water as compared with a range of from 1,008 (low water) to 1,013 (high water), the variable but customary extremes, the level of Gravesend being at the fringe of the fresh water at lowest tides, and secondly the muddy churning which occasions the blocking of the syphon tubes on which the animal depends for its respiratory processes. The original data have at various times been of practical interest to the Port of London Authority, and to the British Museum Authorities with whom my original specimens of ship worm and borings are now deposited. DAMAGES TO LAUNCHES AND HULKS. On the 17th January, the ss. " Golfer " fouled the mooring chains of the mooring barge " Ella Vicars," at East Greenwich, slightly damaging the bows. After an inspection it was found that the damage was not serious ; no further steps were taken in the matter. On the 16th February, the barge " Olive " collided with the " Ella Vicars," doing damage to the starboard quarter saddle and sternpost. The owners of the " Olive " carried out the repairs to my satisfaction. On the 22nd February, the barge " David " broke adrift and went athwart the hulk " Hygeia," necessitating an examination of the moorings. The owners settled the account—£10. On the 22nd February, while boarding the Ketch " Henrietta," the eyebolt of the port quarter of the launch " Lady Truscott " caught the quarter plank of the " Henrietta," causing slight damage to the ketch. I agreed with the owners to a payment of £5 in compensation of the damage. On the 16th March, the barge " Nellie Moore " went athwart the forward moorings of the hulk " Hygeia " and remained there for about four hours during the flood tide. The moorings were overhauled, and the cost of examination of same, £10, was settled by the underwriters. On the 10th June, the ss. " Fox " had occasion to tie up alongside the mooring barge " Ella Vicars," owing to trouble with quadrant. On leaving, the " Fox " damaged the chafing piece and iron band of the " Ella Vicars." Damages paid —£5 15s. 0d. On the 18th October, the ss. " Coaster " did damage to the hulk " Hygeia," forcing the hulk from her station. An examination and survey were held, and a settlement agreed on a basis of compensation of £75. On the 12th December, a fire occurred in the engine room of the " Lady Truscott," the cause of the fire being due to a washer in an oil burner blowing out, 65 the back spray of oil into the engine room became ignited at a lamp carried in the sand box. The fireman sustained burns but continued on duty. His overalls and clothing were damaged. Damage to the paintwork on the launch was agreed upon at £7 10s. On the 21st December, while the " Lady Truscott " was leaving Tilbury Pier, the rubbing piece of the Railway Ferry Boat caught the port holes on port quarter, doing damage thereto. The iron band of the Ferry Boat's rubbing piece was adrift and this was not seen from the wheelhouse of the " Lady Truscott." It did not appear that any responsibility could be attached to the owners of the Ferry Boat. £11 6s. 8d., the cost of repairs, were refunded by the Insurance Company. On the 21st December, while the " George Briggs " was proceeding to her moorings, the propeller was thrown out of gear. The launch had to be towed to the moorings. On an examination it was found that the Vickers Patent Oil gland had been carried away and the fore and after stay broken. In carrying out repairs the wooden hull structure of this launch was found to be the subject of dry rot at various points. On the 22nd December, the cutter " Rambler " collided with the " George Briggs " at her moorings at East Greenwich, doing damage to the launch's side above water line amidships on port side. The owner of the " Rambler " repudiated liability in the matter and pleaded an " Act of God." The damage was agreed with the Insurance Company at £14 8s. 0d. DENTON HOSPITAL. Four new rectangular doors were fitted to the steam boiler, at a cost of £34 10s. Three lengths of fire hose were renewed, at a cost of £13 15s. 6d. Eight new beds and bedding were supplied in August, at a total cost of £30 9s. 7d. Insurance of the Lyons Steam Disinfector at Denton Hospital was effected in November. STAFF. Hospital.—Mr. and Mrs. Overrill were appointed as Handyman and Laundress respectively, on February 8th. Inspectors.—Wm. Gray successfully passed the examination of the Royal Sanitary Institute ; he was permanently appointed as a 3rd Class Inspector. CANAL BOATS ACTS. In accordance with Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I beg to present herewith the Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority during the year ended 31st December, 1922. The Acts and Regulations apply within the whole of the district under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, including the River and Docks, as a " canal," for the purposes of "the Act, " includes any river, inland navigation, lake, or water being within the body of a county, whether it is or is not within the ebb or flow of the tide. The navigation, in addition to the enclosed Docks, includes the following navigable tributary waters and creeks of the River Thames:— On the right bank— From Teddington downwards:— Wandsworth Creek (River Wandle). Hay's Dock. St. Saviour's Dock. Part of the Grand Surrey Canal within the Surrey Commercial Docks. Deadman's Dock. Deptford Creek (River Ravensbourne). Dartford Creek (Rivers Cray and Darenth). The entrance to the Gravesend Canal. Cliffe Creek. Yantlet and Coalmouth Creeks. Part of the River Medway, and of the Swale. On the left bank— From Teddington downwards:— The entrance to the River Brent. Hammersmith Creek. Chelsea Dock. Grosvenor Dock. Limekiln Creek. Bow Creek (River Lea). Barking Creek (River Roding). Rainham Creek (River Ingrebourne). Mucking Creek. Thames Haven. Hole Haven. Havengore Creek. River Roach as far as Rochford. I 2 66 RIVER. The whole of this area is divided into three districts, known as Upper, Middle and Tower, each district being in charge of an Inspector, as follows:— Upper District.— Teddington to Greenwich Inspector Gray, £104 per annum. Middle District.— Greenwich to Erith Lower District.— Erith to seaward limits of the Port of London (including part of the River Medway) Inspector Berry. £230 per annum. The docks are divided into four districts, known as the Central, Eastern, Western and the Gravesend District. Central District.— West India Dock Inspector Elward. £250 per annum. South West India Dock Poplar Dock Millwall Dock Eastern District.— Royal Victoria Dock Inspector Burr. £250 per annum. East India Dock Royal Albert Dock Inspector Lambe. £250 per annum. King George V. Dock Western District.— London Dock Inspector Hopkins. £250 per annum. St. Katherine's Dock Regent's Dock Surrey Commercial Dock Gravesend District.— Tilbury Dock Inspector Massie. £240 per annum. Left Shore, from Purfleet down Right Shore, from Erith down (2) The total number of inspections for the year was 178, representing a nett number of 86 boats. The remainder, 92, represents repeated visits by Inspectors of this Authority. The number of boats not conforming to the Acts and Regulations was 36 (inspected on 75 occasions, or 20.22 per cent. of the total inspections, the percentage for the previous five years being 21.73 per cent.). In addition to the above, 4 boats were at the time of visit found with the cabin doors locked, there being no persons on board. Inspection was therefore impossible, and these visits are not included in the number of boats inspected. (3) With reference to the various infringements of the Act:— 1922. Unregistered Boats. Feb. 3 " Breydon " Registered at Brentford, No. 407. „ 28 " Meiville " Boat not seen since in the Port of London. Mar. 3 " Breydon " See above. „ 15 " Lucy " Boat not seen since in the Port of London. Notification of Change of Master. Nil.
