AC.4363 1 Mr. Emafre Dw 5B 2 Library SHOR 60 REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF SHOREDITCH IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON FOR THE YEAR 1955 BY B. BROADBENT, M. A. ,M. B., M. R. C. S., D. P. H., Medical Officer of Health. S.S. 3881 REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF SHOREDITCH IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON FOR THE YEAR 1955 BY B. BROADBENT, M. A., M. B., M.R. C. S., D. P. H. , Medical Officer of Health. Printed by WATERLOW & SONS LIMITED. S.S. 3881 2. To the MAYOR, ALDERMEN and COUNCILLORS of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH of SHOREDITCH. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, My annual report for 1955 again follows the 'economy' lines as laid down by the Minister of Health, and continues since 1948 to be printed in the cheapest way available, but for the first time since 1934, we have this time produced, on page 32 something other than bare print and tables - without additional expense:- in a worthy cause. By this means we intend to show that Shoreditch is "not as black as it is painted", in that the smoke pollution was among the lowest in London even before the City went "smokeless"-largely cwing to the unremitting attention given to these matters by several generations of sanitary inspectors. Whilst on the subject of sanitary inspectors I must add that, though we were understaffed last year, repeated advertisement has failed to maintain even that number on the staff. This reduction is only natural, when one remembers that in other areas where the same-or better-salaries are paid, they can live in the midst of their working area, instead of spending time and money in travelling to work and feeding away from home. But this state of affairs can be really tragic in Boroughs such as this where the new legislation (see pages 28, 29, 31 and 42) must be applied fully, and the old maintained also, if the Borough's health is to continue. The vital statistics have remained satisfactory however, and though the population has decreased by 480 to 45,480, birth and death rates have fractionally increased, and the number of deaths under 1 year of age has again improved to 19.7 per 1,000 live births (compared with 24.9 for England and Wales, and 23.2 for London), whilst, for the fourth year in succession, we have had no maternal deaths. The one tragedy in the year was that, after 5 years without a single case of diphtheria, we had not merely 3 cases of diphtheria (in one family), but an aotual death from the disease. The disease was brought from a school in a neighbouring L.C.C. division by a boy who remained quite well himself, but infected his younger brothers and sister who had not been immunised. The adults and the immunised members of the family remained unaffected, and this points the moral in favour of immunisation. The "Hackney Gazette", and the Council's "Newsletter" spread this information, and the local immunisation clinics were crowded for one session, but so short is the public's memory, that everything reverted to routine within one week: That such a simple and painless procedure which has so much protection to offer should be so ignored by a civilised community is to me quite unbelievable: Fortunately, in this case, we were able to limit the outbreak to one family, but for how long oan we hope to be so successful? (especially as carriers can broadcast these killing germs without being at all ill themselves). Tuberculosis accounted for 14 deaths (11 last year), and 13 of these were over 45, but the most satisfying feature is that the new notifications reaohed the lowest figure in the history of the Borough (0.92 per 1,000 of the populationthe next lowest having been last year at 1.05 per 1,000). The deaths from other diseases varied only fractionally, with the exception of cancer of the breast, and coronary disease, both of which increased appreciably. There is very little excuse for the former in these days, because the lump becomes obvious so very early, and the cure is very reliable in these early stages, not only by operation, but particularly by X-ray treatment. The prevention of coronary disease is more difficult, and much research on this subject is in progress. The disease has only been separated in the returns since 1950, since when the yearly figures in 3. Shoreditch have been 50, 47, 46, 64, 44, and now this year a record of 73. Certain research indicates rather strongly that the eating of extra fat has some bearing on the matter, and I quite believe that more Shoreditch people now have eggs or bacon for breakfast, fat beef or pork for dinner, and quantities of butter to eat than was the case when wages were lower than at present, and that this simple fact has probably some bearing on the matter. If they reverted to their extra vegetables and even bread, and in addition took more fruit and salads, I am sure this figure (and perhaps even their own) would improve: Notifications of infectious disease were remarkably similar to last year's with the exception of an increase in whooping cough from 32 to 151 (this could be improved by the greater use of immunisation against this disease also). Unfortunately we were involved in an outbreak of paratyphoid fever in a neighbouring borough where the baker concerned did not use a separate mixing machine for his artificial cream. We were fortunate in that only 17 oases occurred, with no deaths, but this was a means by which we were able to impress on Shoreditch bakers the importance of this precaution-and will, we hope, be the means of preventing further outbreaks from this cause. Poliomyelitis showed an increase on the 2 of 1954, with 7 paralytic and 4 non-paralytic patients (only two had lasting trouble, one being still in hospital and walking with calipers, and the other unfortunately dying in February 1956, the others having completely recovered with no paralysis remaining). However, we sincerely hope that all parents will take advantage of the protection offered by the Ministry's new vaccine which has now proved itself to be quite safe and should be a great help. There was a successful mass miniature radiography survey of 2,193 workers in the Borough (reported on page 19), which discovered 5 new active tuberculosis patients, and 2 with cancer of the lung. Our Tuberculosis Care Committee made good progress (page 20) and did most useful work. I will not dilate on our Social Welfare work here, except to acknowledge our great indebtedness to King Edward's Hospital Fund with whose aid an extension with six new ground floor bedrooms was added to our Holiday Home during 1955. A fuller account is on pages 21-23. Considering their reduced numbers our remaining sanitary inspectors did a very useful year's work, as did the disinfectors. All furniture taken into the Council's new flats is still disinfested with HCN, thus avoiding invidious distinctions between tenants (page 27). The Housing Repairs & Rents Act, and the registration of hairdressers are well in hand, thanks to the C.S.I. and Deputy C.S.I, (pages 28-29), our smoke abatement campaign is detailed on page 31, and our very successful food hygiene exhibition is mentioned on page 42. Training of student sanitary inspectors has been in progress for 10 years now (page 46), but unfortunately the less urbanised boroughs have received the major part of the benefits of this scheme. The Housing figures may at first sight appear somewhat disappointing as affecting this department but this is largely due to the fact that after 1953 the Housing Committee became aware that much delay was caused by waiting for the Ministry's results of official enquiries following representations from me, and so replaced these by compulsory purchase. But, up to 1953 this borough had the highest post-war figures for Medical Officer of Health representations of any 4. London borough, in proportion to its size, and its record is still outstanding for the number of housing units erected. Individual houses represented as unfit rose from 16 to 62, and section 12 closing orders on tenements or underground rooms increased from 20 to 94. Overcrowding was relieved in 91 cases as against 31 in 1954. It is with deep regret that I have to record the death of Dr. Evelyn McGregor, in her 60th year, who was my assistant until 1948 when she was transferred as deputy divisional medical officer to our local division of the L.C.C., but I am gratified that the Borough Council has recognised the value of her services by naming a new block of flats "McGregor Court". I would again like to put on record my gratitude to every member of the department for the loyal support given to me throughout the year. In conclusion, I wish to thank all members of the Council and my colleagues in other departments of both this and other Councils for their cooperation during 1955. Yours faithfully, B. BROADBENT, Medical Officer of Health. P.S. As we go to press, the Registrar-General has just issued his report on daytime populations, in which I understand (the Library's copy not having yet arrived) he states that for the 7 inner London Boroughs with a resident population of 300,000, the daytime population is 1,300,000. This would raise the population of Shoreditch for which the Council and its officers are responsible to over 120,000, and this is confirmed by the relative rates per head of resident population, even if the de-rating of industrial premises is ignored. 5.

II - POPULATION, BIRTHS, MARRIAGES AND DEATHS. The Registrar-General's estimate for the mid-year 1955 population was 45,480, a decrease of 480 from the previous year. This figure is used for statistical purposes throughout the report. The density of the population is 69 persons per acre. The Area Comparability Factors for the borough are Births 0.88 and Deaths 1.04, and the rates shown in this report have been adjusted accordingly. BIRTHS. The numbers of registered live births allocated to the Borough during the calendar year 1955 were as follows:- Total live births - (legitimate and illegitimate) Males 394 Females 367 Total 761 Illegitimate live births- Males 28 Females 27 Total 55 The birth rate for the borough was 14,72. For England and Wales the rate was 15.0, and for London 15.1. The illegitimate births represented 7.22 per cent of all births in the borough. STILLBIRTHS. The number of registered stillbirths allocated to the borough was 17 or 2.2 per cent of all births. MARRIAGES. The number of marriages during the year was 486 and the marriage rate was 21.3 per 1,000 population. The marriage rate for the Metropolis was 20,8 and that for England and Wales 16,1. DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in the borough in 1955-528 Transferable deaths- Non-residents registered in Shoreditch, - 110 Shoreditch residents registered elsewhere, - 167 The number of deaths allocated to the borough is accordingly - 585 This gives a death rate for the borough of 13.37 compared with 11.7 for England and Wales, and 11,5 for London. In connection with these 11. deaths 16 inquests were held. 437 or 74.7 per cent of the people belonging to Shoreditch who died during the year, died in public institutions. The table on page 9 showing causes of deaths at all ages has been supplied by the Registrar-General. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The deaths of infants under one year numbered 15 of which 12 were males. These deaths amounted to 2,56 per cent of the total net Shoreditch deaths from all causes, as compared with 3,03 per cent in 1954, The infantile mortality rate (death rate of infants under one year per 1,000 live births) for Shoreditch was 19,71, the rate for England and Wales being 24,9 and that for London 23.2. One illegitimate infant died. The number of deaths of infants under 4 weeks of age was 12, which gives a neo-natal rate of 15.76. INFANTILE MORTALITY IN THE BOROUGH DURING 1955.

MATERNAL MORTALITY, 1955. No maternal death was recorded during the year. The maternal mortality rates in England and Wales and in Shoreditch during the past seven years are given below Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live and Still Births 1955 1954 1953 1952 1951 1950 1949 England and Wales 0.64 0.69 0.76 0.72 0.79 0.86 0.98 Shoreditch Nil Nil Nil Nil 1.18 Mil 1.13 CANCER. The deaths from cancer in the Borough during the year numbered 113 as compared with 127 in 1954. BURIAL OF THE DEAD. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Borough Council is responsible for arranging for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in their area, and where no other suitable arrangements for burial have been made or are being made. During the year 4 burials were carried out. The Council have not yet carried out any cremations, as although it may appear at the time of death that there are no surviving relatives, there is always the remote possibility that at some future date, one may come forward and start enquiries which might result in the Council's action being disputed. III. INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. During the year the number of notifications received (excluding tuberculosis and food poisoning) was 985. Of these cases 15 were found not to be suffering from the disease stated on the certificate, which gives a corrected number of 970 cases for the year. SMALLPOX AND VACCINATION.

PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS 1925. These regulations prohibit a person suffering from tuberculosis, and who is in an infectious condition, from following any employment or occupation in connection with a dairy which would involve the milking of cows, the treatment of milk, or the handling of vessels used for containing milk. No formal action was necessary during the year. MASS MINIATURE RADIOGRAPHY. I am indebted to Dr. Thompson for the following report- "Mass Radiography Unit 6D carried out a "Survey" in the Borough from 7th September to 23rd September, 1955, during which miniatures and large films were taken. The Unit operated in the News Room of the Central Library, 236, Kingsland Road, E.2. through the kind permission of the Libraries Committee. 19. Prior to the Survey, firms in Shoreditch were circulated by the Public Health Department, when the opportunity was taken of emphasising the value and importance of the Mass Radiography Service, As a result of this circulation 119 firms sent details of volunteers to the Mass Radiography Unit, which drew up a suitable programme for examinations. Wherever possible, fresh appointments were offered when the original appointment had been missed. The appointment system was adopted for these sessions, as it was considered that this method ensured a greater saving in a firm's time. During this Survey eight afternoon and evening "Public Sessions" were held, at which no appointment was necessary. There were, as in the case of the Planned Sessions, special periods for men and women. To draw particular attention to the Public Sessions a special poster was prepared and displayed throughout the Borough, and several thousand handbills were distributed. Advertisements also appeared in the Local Press. Supplies of the handbill were sent to ministers in the Borough, and their helpful co-operation is herewith acknowledged. Of further assistance was the communication sent to the Local Press. It must be admitted that the attendances at the Public Sessions were disappointing. The best attendance was secured at the final session, and this was doubtless due to the fact that on the previous evening at the fortnightly Film Shows arranged by the Public Libraries, the special film demonstrating the function and operation of the Mass Radiography Service - "The X-Ray Inspector" was included in the programme. The Organising Secretary of the Unit was present and made a brief speech at the termination of the film. The following table summarises the results attained: MEN WOMEN TOTAL X-Rayed on Miniature Films - Planned Sessions. 1265 928 2193 " Public Sessions. 267 315 582 1532 1243 2775 Recalled for Large Films 42 22 64 Interviews by Medical Director 12 10 22 As a result of the Medical Director's interviews the majority of cases were referred to the appropriate Chest Clinics for further investigation, with the undermentioned results: Active Tuberculosis 3 2 5 Inactive Tuberculosis 5 6 11 As a further analysis it is interesting to note that of the cases of Active Tuberculosis, four cases were derived from the Planned Sessions and one from the Public Sessions, while of the eleven cases of Inactive Tuberculosis five were derived from the Planned Sessions and six from the Public Sessions. In addition there were two cases (men) of carcinoma of the lung, which were referred to the appropriate hospital. In conclusion we would like to express our grateful appreciation of the help rendered by the Medical Officer of Health and his staff, prior and during the Unit's operations at the Central Library, Shoreditch." 20. SHOREDITCH TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE. I am indebted to Miss E.B. Guest, the secretary of the Shoreditch Tuberculosis Care Committee, for the following report of Care Work for the year ended 31st December, 1955. "During the year to 31st December, 1955, small increases were made in Retirement Pensions and National Assistance Board grants (averaging 2/6d per person and 3/6d in the case of certain tuberculous persons). Although welcome, these increases did not bring the total allowances anywhere near the amounts necessary to maintain even a moderate standard of living, particularly for elderly people, with no prospect of returning to work, and the London County Council's extra nourishment grants of milk, eggs and/or butter continue to be very necessary to tuberculous patients to supplement their diet. The results of the Christmas Seal Sale enabled the work of extra financial help for the tuberculous to be continued, £276 net having been added to the fund through this medium to meet particular needs. The Committee was very pleased that we could thus go on helping our patients, particularly those off work on long periods of sick leave, to combat the continued high cost of living. As in previous years, £40 was received from the London County Council Sunday Cinema Entertainments Fund and £17.10.0 from the United Charities of St. Leonard. This money was spent in making life easier for tuberculous patients and their families - in helping them with wireless commitments, in paying fares for relatives to visit patients in sanatoria, in giving clothes and taking on removal expenses and hire purchase accounts for patients unexpectedly incapacitated. Raring the year it was reported to the Committee that the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board had it in mind to close down the tuberculosis ward in St. Leonard's Hospital and transfer the patients then in the ward to another hospital. The members of the Committee took up the matter with the Shoreditch Borough Council and a letter of protest was also sent from this Committee direct to the Board. Representations were made to the Board and, so far, the ward in question is still open for tuberculous patients. The Committee were informed during the year that a proposal was under consideration that patients in part of Hackney should, at some time in the future, come under the supervision of the Shoreditch Chest Clinic, with the consequent extra care work becoming the responsibility of this Committee. By the end of the year, however, nothing definite had been settled regarding this proposed transfer of patients and discussions were still proceeding. Mr. W. Bentley, the Borough Treasurer of Shoreditch and the Hon.Treasurer of this fund for many years, retired from his work in Shoreditch and the Committee expressed grateful thanks to Mr. Bentley for all the work he had done on behalf of the Fund. Mr. F.J. Bailey, the new Borough Treasurer of Shoreditch, kindly agreed to act as Hon. Treasurer of the fund in his place. 21. In November 1955, a scheme for occupational therapy for home bound patients commenced, and the London County Council are now paying the salary of an Occupational Therapist to go round and teach various handicrafts to those patients who are unable to get to the class held at the clinic. As with the Handicraft. Class, the Care Fund pays for materials and necessary tools. The patients enjoy these short periods of instruction at home and have made some very useful and attractive articles. We thank all who have assisted the Committee in any way during the year, particularly the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association and the Forces' Help Society. Cases assisted by Shoreditch Tuberculosis Fund: Cases referred for extra help to: Clothing 38 National Assistance Board (in addition to applications for maintenance) 18 Fares 84 Loans 9 Rent arrears 4 S.S.A.F.A. 10 Removal expenses 1 British Red Cross 3 Money grants 19 Forces Help Society 5 Wireless expenses 11 Shaftesbury Society 6 Other help 23 Other Societies 3 (The accounts for the year showed that, of an income of nearly £530, a balance of £6 remained)." V. - SOCIAL WELFARE SERVICES. During 1955, the Council's various welfare activities continued unabated, and even spread their net wider than before, so that all (particularly the old people) have never before received so much assistance and pleasure. The various old people's clubs continued to thrive, and their members had even more days' outings to the seaside, women's institutes in the country, pantomimes, etc., than ever before. The Meals on Wheels service was shared between the W.V.S. and the Red Cross, and used entirely Council transport for this purpose, convoying the meals in insulated containers provided by the Council under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act. A local caterer has continued to provide excellent two-course meals, individually for this purpose, and in bulk for the clubs, at 1/6d per meal, (the old people paying only 10d as a result of the L.C.C's. 8d subsidy) the total averaging 100 meals a day. 22. The Council's Holiday Home at Copthorne in Sussex has not only continued to give a fortnight's holiday for all old people wishing to go at a cost to the pensioner of 10/- to 15/- a week (according to season), but has taken even more mothers and babies from the whole of England than ever before. A further great improvement to the Home has been effected with the help of King Edward's Hospital Fund, by the building of an extension containing six ground floor bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. The Sunbabies Trustees also brought up-to-date the television set they gave previously, by having it adapted for commercial television, and agreed in addition to renew the children's slide. The S.O.S. cards have been distributed now to nearly 1,000 old people who live alone, and have proved useful on occasions, as well as giving some degree of confidence to the old people concerned. The second-hand furniture distribution continues, but three-piece suites are having to be refused now as unsuitable. The L.C.C's. health visitors are giving occasional talks in the clubs, and their home helps continue to do invaluable work. The work of our welfare visitors is being supplemented by the Hoxton Market Christian Mission, and the link with the National Assistance Board gives much-needed help with mattresses, and fireguards, as well as money, to the old people. St. Matthew's Hospital still co-operates perfectly, and the L.C.C's. "Hillside" home assists with many intermediate cases, but everything feasible is done to keep the old people in their own homes where this is at all possible. Additional most valuable help has been given during the past year by the Lion Boys' Club who have repaired old people's shoes entirely free of charge, and now the North Thames Gas Board (both Central and Northern Divisions) have begun to give free service to old people whose gas fittings are unsafe or inaccessible (highly-placed gas maters, loose gas taps, rubber tubing on gas rings, etc.). At the other extreme of the age groups, the Council have contributed to the building of an adventure playground, and the Nuffield Trust have begun an experiment in the prevention of juvenile delinquency, known as the "Shoreditch Project" ("not because Shoreditch is particularly delinquent"). 23. The numbers of persons who attended the Shoreditch Holiday & Rest Home at Copthorne during 1955 were as follows:- Adults 227 10-18 years 18 5-10 years 66 9 months - 5 years 160 Under 9 months 58 Old Age Pensioners 249 Conference members - Total 778 The following table shows the average attendances at the Old People's Clubs during the year (1) (2) (3) Old People's Clubs Average number of attendances Av.weekly No.of Dinners Teas Mon.

It was necessary to take measures on account of the presence of vermin in 54 houses, and in connection with these 127 rooms were dealt with, sanitary notices being served where necessary. PERSONAL CLEANSING. The arrangement with the Finsbury Borough Council whereby residents of Shoreditch requiring treatment for Scabies or Vermin are sent to that Authority's Cleansing Station at Pine Street, was continued throughout the year. The numbers of treatments carried out are shown in the following tables:- VERMINOUS PERSONS. New Cases Total new cases Reattendances Total treatments 0 to 15 years Over 15 years - 9 9 - 9 SCABIES. New Cases Total new cases Reattendances Total treatments 0 to 15 years Over 15 years 2 11 13 14 27 (Until school-leaving age, the L.C.C. treat all affected children at their own Centre). 27. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The number of disinfections of rooms after infectious disease and other reasons was 137. The number of articles disinfected in this connection at the Council's steam disinfector was 1138. During the year 514 rooms were sprayed for verminous conditions and the number of articles disinfected was 11,532. In addition to the articles disinfected for infectious disease, etc., the Department carried out disinfection of articles for private firms in the Borough and various goods were disinfected, for which charges amounting to £13.10s. were made. During the year 417 families were removed to new housing accommodation on the Borough Council's housing estates. This work entails a considerable amount of additional work for the staff. All furniture is disinfected by the Hydrogen Cyanide method prior to removal to the new accommodation by a firm of contractors under the supervision of the officers of the Department. When informed by the Housing Department of the families to be removed, it is necessary for an officer of the Public Health Department to ascertain the amount of furniture per family and to make arrangements as to whether one or more families can be removed in the one furniture van. By this means there is a considerable reduction in the cost of removals. The vans are usually met at 8 a.m. at a rendezvous on the date of removal and it is our duty to see that all the furniture is placed in the van and the tenant given instructions with regard to food as well as seeing that arrangements are made for the reception of soft furniture after disinfestation has taken place. When the furniture is loaded on the van it is taken to the Disinfecting Station; the van is then sealed and charged with HCN. The whole of the contents are disinfested for approximately four hours, the van is then opened, tested, and when clear of HCN the van moves to the new flat and the furniture is delivered. Soft goods, (that is, bedding, mattresses etc.) which are collected at the same time as the furniture by the Borough Council disinfecting van, are disinfected by the Council's disinfecting apparatus and returned at the same time as the furniture. The next morning the whole of the furniture is chemically tested to make sure that the whole of the HCN has been removed from the furniture and fittings. Much work has been done during the year in connection with the prevention of the breeding of cockroaches and beetles. Hot water ducts in new Council flats provide a favourable breeding ground for cockroaches and beetles but by arrangement with the Borough Architect's Department insecticide powder is placed in the hot water ducts when they are being constructed. This method of control has proved to be very successful. 28. The depositing of insanitary and other putrescible matter on vacant sites and other places by unauthorized persons is a practice which is not easily controlled. During the year many sites have been sprayed to prevent the breeding of flies on putrescible matter, 201 articles being removed and 83 sites sprayed. During the year circular letters were sent to every tenant of two large blocks of flats in the Borough, inviting the co-operation of the tenants in refraining from depositing refuse in other than the dust receptacles, and a certain amount of improvement was effected by this method. Disinfection of sandpits and public open spaces. By arrangement with the Borough Surveyor sandpits in the children's playgrounds in the Borough were disinfected with bleaching powder as a precaution against the spread of infectious disease, particularly poliomyelitis. HOUSING REPAIRS & RENTS ACT, 1954. Work in connection with the above-named Act, which came into force last year, has continued to be an added responsibility to the Department, particularly regarding applications made on behalf of tenants for Certificates of Disrepair. This work entails an added burden to the work of the Public Health Department and owing to the shortages of sanitary inspectorate staff the work in this connection has been taken over by the Chief Sanitary Inspector and his Deputy. Work in connection with applications for Certificates of Disrepair means several visits to premises in order to make sure that the certificates are accurate. When Certificates of Disrepair have been issued a considerable amount of reinspection is necessary, with a final inspection where a Certificate of Revocation has been asked for. During the year 80 applications were made on behalf of tenants for Certificates of Disrepair where notices of increase of rent had been served by the owners. Of the 80 applications made, 76 were granted. In this connection 51 Certificates of Revocation were granted. The Chief Sanitary Inspector reports that the number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair was not as great as expected. It was noticed that applications for certificates were mainly concerned with the better type of properties in the Borough, including flats. Evidence was gained that house agents were advising their clients against the demand for increased rent in the case of the poorer type of property. In such cases where Certificates of Disrepair were issued and the work required by the landlord to bring the house into a state of good repair was carried out, it was observed that the standard of work was very good. In connection with the above-named Act, it is a requirement that owners shall provide certain particulars in the rent books. In many instances it was found that the provisions of the Act were not being complied with, and in this connection letters were sent to owners where the required information had not been supplied to the tenant. 29. REGISTRATION OF HAIRDRESSERS. During the year the Borough Council made Byelaws which came into force on the 1st October 1955. The Chief Sanitary Inspector and his Deputy made inspections of the 46 registered hairdressing establishments in the Borough. Advice was given on the conditions and standards of hygiene required by the Byelaws, and in certain cases where deficiencies were observed intimation of the defects was given to the occupiers. Generally speaking the standard of cleanliness observed in the hairdressing establishments in the Borough is good. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough is controlled by the Metropolitan Water Board and is relayed from public mains direct to houses. No complaint regarding the quality of the water was received during the year. SWIMMING BATH WATER. There are two Swimming baths in the Borough, one of which is open all the year round, the other during the summer months only. During the year fifteen samples of water from the baths were sent for bacteriological examination and fifteen for analytical examination, and all were found to be satisfactory. EXAMINATION OF WATER FROM WELLS. Three wells were in use in Shoreditch during the year, none being used for drinking or domestic purposes. OFFENSIVE TRADE PREMISES. An establishment order under Section 140, Public Health (London) Act, 1936, was renewed during the year in respect of the business of a Fur Skin Dresser. The number of visits made was 4. 30. SHOPS ACT, 1950. Sub-Section (2) of Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950 requires that in every shop, not being a shop exempt from the provisions of this SubSection, there shall be provided and maintained suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences available for the use of persons employed in or about the shop. Sub-Section (6) of Section 38 provides that a shop may be exempted from the provisions of Sub-Section (2) if there is in force a certificate exempting the shop therefrom granted by the authority whose duty it is to enforce those provisions. A certificate is granted if the authority are satisfied that by reason of restricted accommodation or other special circumstances it is not practicable to provide such accommodation on the premises and that alternative arrangements are oonveniently available. 1 Certificate of exemption in respect of sanitary conveniences was issued during the year. The number of inspections and re-inspections made during the year was 1,167. COMPULSORY REMOVAL OF AGED AND INFIRM PERSONS. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are empowered to apply to a Court for an Order for the removal to hospital or other institution of a person who is aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, and who is living in insanitary conditions and "unable to devote to himself, and is not receiving from other persons proper care and attention". In addition, during 1951, the National Assistance (Amendment) Act came into force. Under this Act, on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and another practitioner, emergency removals of such people for periods not exceeding three weeks may be enforced by the Courts. No action under this Section was necessary during the year. RAG SCALERS. There are 14 premises in the Borough in which the business of Rag Dealer is carried on. 21 Visits were paid during the year. 31. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. During the year a strenuous campaign was carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors to reduce atmospheric pollution in the Borough. The work may be defined under four main headings - 1. Practical advice given in factories, kitchens, bakehouses, and fried fish shops. 2. Practical demonstrations and advice given to the occupiers of local authority flats, and instruction given to stokers employed on local authority housing estates in Shoreditch. 3. The co-operation of neighbouring authorities. 4. Daily measurement of smoke and maintenance of records. During the year 677 observations of non-domestic chimneys in the Borough were made by the Sanitary Inspectors and in consequence of the observations 17 Notices were served on the owners of premises causing smoke nuisances. In all cases where smoke was observed visits were immediately made to the premises and advice given, and as a result of the visits by the Sanitary Inspectors and an explanation as to the best practical means of abating the nuisances, results have been very encouraging. Numerous small furniture making factories and similar places provide space heating and cheap disposal of trade refuse (sawdust, chips, etc.) by burning it in fire grates and stoves which are of a type not capable of, or designed to produce complete combustion and consequently smoke nuisances are caused by the burning of these waste products. The advice given AND FREQUENTLY TAKEN as to alternative means for the disposal of refuse has secured a measure of success. Encouragement has been given to occupiers of food premises to abolish the use of solid fuel in the interests of cleanliness of the premises and the prevention of atmospheric pollution. Two fried fish shops and one bakehouse have accepted our suggestions and installed gas appliances. In one large factory, acting on a suggestion from the Department, two Lancashire boilers are now fired with coke instead of coal and a serious smoke nuisance has been abolished. During the year a Smoke Abatement Campaign and demonstrations in the form of a mobile exhibition, extending from 28th March to 2nd May was arranged. Six sites were chosen, situate at Borough Council flats, the object being to advise and instruct occupiers of post war dwellings in the 32. proper use of their modern firegrates and to encourage them to use a solid smokeless fuel, such as coke. In connection with this Exhibition 68 merchants licensed to supply fuel in Shoreditch were invited, together with representatives of other official organisations, to a meeting in the Town Hall to discuss the campaign. The meeting was addressed by the Medical Officer of Health, Chief Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Alderman D. Wray and others. The difficulties of supplies of solid smokeless fuel, particularly coke, was the main topic discussed, and the majority of the merchants agreed to co-operate with us in an endeavour to get a better supply of solid smokeless fuel (coke) in the Borough. During the period that the Mobile Exhibition Unit was in the Borough, all caretakers employed in Borough Council flats received instruction on the efficient working of the boilers and methods of reducing atmospheric pollution by ensuring efficient combustion of the fuel. When nuisances are observed from chimneys in adjoining authorities, information is sent to the Public Health Department of the local authority concerned. The volumetric measurement of smoke and sulphur in the atmosphere was commenced at the beginning of the year. The keeping of daily records and graphs is an important part of the work and the results are submitted monthly to be collated by the Ministry of Fuel and Power for publication in their monthly bulletin. As a matter of interest the following diagram sets out a comparison between smoke in Shoreditch and other parts of the Metropolitan area:- MONTHLY AVERAGE OF SMOKE IN METROPOLITAN AREA (January to December 1955) MILLIGRAMS PER CUBIC METRE 33. HOUSING - OVER CROWDING AND PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT. At the end of 1954 the total number of overcrowded cases on the Public Health Department register was 247, and the number on the medical preferential treatment register was 81. During the year 18 new cases of overcrowding and one new case recommended for preferential treatment on medical grounds were added to the register. 13 Overcrowded families and 2 preferential treatment cases were rehoused, and a check of names on the registers revealed that a further 78 overcrowded cases and 17 preferential treatment cases could be deleted, having found other accommodation themselves. The number of overcrowded cases remaining on the register at the end of the year was therefore reduced to 174, and the number on the preferential treatment register to 63. Fifty-five visits of inspection were made during the year. UNDERGROUND ROOMS . During the year a complete survey of the underground rooms register was made by the Chief Sanitary Inspector. Inspections were made of all rooms and the register revised. This was necessary as so many of the rooms on the register were at premises now demolished. The number of underground rooms on the register at the end of the year was 885. During the year the number of underground rooms in respect of which Closing Orders were made or undertakings accepted was 46. In 4 cases Closing Orders were determined on the rooms being made to comply with the Underground Room Regulations. FACTORIES ACT, 1937. The number of Factories on the Register at the end of 1955 was Power Factories 1,123 Non-Power Factories 142 Total 1,265 During the year 75 factories were added to the Register and 116 deleted, making a nett decrease in the number of factories in the Borough of 41. 34. The particulars of inspections made during the year are as follows:- Premises Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted Power Factories 1,616 135 - Non-Power Factories 108 11 - Other Premises under the Act (including works of building and engineering construction but not including out-workers' premises) - - - Total 1,724 146 - The defects found and dealt with were as follows Particulars Number of defects Number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted Found Remedied Referred To H.M.

HOME WORK. During the year 64 lists of outworkers were received from employers in the Borough, 31 in the first half-year due in February, and 33 in the second half-year due in August. These lists contained the names of 1,736 outworkers, of whom 1,303 were not resident in Shoreditch. The addresses of those non-resident were forwarded to the Sanitary Authorities of the districts to which they belonged. Lists were also received from 18 other Local Authorities containing the names of 434 outworkers living in Shoreditch and employed by firms outside the Borough. The total number of out-workers reported was therefore 2,170. As has been pointed out in previous reports, in numerous instances names and addresses of outworkers are duplicated owing to lists being sent in twice a year, and in some cases out-workers are employed by more than one firm, so that the numbers given must not be taken as representing actual numbers of individual workers. The tables on pages 35 and 36 show the distribution of out-workers as regards trades. During the year 169 visits of inspection were made to places where home work was being carried on, but no defect necessitating the service of a sanitary notice was found.

HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. General observation was kept on the sale of heating appliances to ensure that they complied with the Regulations made under the above-named Act and in several cases the sellers and users of heating appliances requested that their guards be tested. The Chief Sanitary Inspector made several tests of appliances at the request of manufacturers and others in the Borough. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949. The rodent staff employed for this particular work consists of one rodent supervisor - Mr. Bryant (part-time), one investigator and two rodent operators. The whole of the sewer system throughout the Borough was treated and poison baiting was carried out twice during the year. The number of complaints received in connection with the common rat increased during the year, probably owing to the amount of new building which has been done in the Borough and the consequent disturbance of old drains during demolition. It is customary, when buildings are demolished, for the Sanitary Inspector to visit and ensure that the old drains are effectively sealed off from the sewer. In connection with the complaints received, 483 drains were tested and in 50 cases it was found that the drainage was defective. Notices were served to remedy the defects found. There has been a continued decrease in complaints regarding infestation by the black rat. Infestations from mice appear to have been on the decrease this year. The following tables are an indication of the amount of work carried out in connection with the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949 - 39. REPORT FOR 12 MONTHS ENDING 31.3.56.

R3(BP) received and charged to business premises from 1st January to 31st December, 1956 amounted to £664,0.0. PIGEONS. During the last few years the nuisance from pigeons has increased. This year permission was granted to a specialist pigeon trapper to trap pigeons causing a nuisance in the Borough. This work is carried out without any charge to the Council and the trapper works under the general direction of the Chief Sanitary Inspector. During the year approximately 600 were destroyed. 41. NUISANCES FROM NOISE. Complaints regarding nuisances from noise have been on the increase. In one particular case investigated this year complaints were received regarding noise from machinery. The factory concerned was working for 24 hours a day on shift work on goods for export and many inspections were made, during the day as well as late at night. After many suggestions and alterations to the machinery, and the fitting of suppressors to certain parts of the machinery, the noise was brought down to reasonable limits. FOOD HYGIENE. The work in connection with food hygiene was continued throughout the year, and regular inspections of all premises in the Borough where food is handled were carried out. The total number of food-handling premises in the Borough at the end of 1965 was 1,076, as follows Cafes and Restaurants 168 Factory and Warehouse Canteens 104 Ice Cream Shops and Manufacturers 162 Milk Shops and Depots 88 Butchers' Shops and Stores 42 Fried Fish Shops 14 Fish Curers 9 Bakehouses 13 Food Factories 11 Food Warehouses 12 Clubs, Schools, etc. 25 Grocery Shops 106 Bakers' Shops 27 Confectioners' Shops 76 Greengrocers' Shops 43 Corn Chandlers' Shops 3 Chemists' Shops 22 Public Houses 140 Off Licences 6 Other premises selling mineral waters, etc. 5 1,076 42. The preparation and introduction of new food legislation has been a significant feature in food hygiene during the year. The Food & Drugs Act 1955, which consolidated and amended previous Food Legislation, became operative on the 1st January 1956. Under the Food & Drugs Act 1955, the Minister is empowered to make Regulations. Throughout the year food traders, trade organisations and other official bodies have continued discussions and made recommendations to the appropriate Government Departments on Draft Food Hygiene Regulations. Regulations known as the Food & Drugs Hygiene Regulations 1955, came into operation with the Act on 1st January 1956. A great deal of publicity and speculation prompted Trade Associations to advise their members as to the ultimate effect this new legislation was likely to have upon them, and steadily a consciousness was in evidence amongst the food traders for a desire to gain as much information as possible in readiness for any measures they may be requested to adopt to comply with the new law. Health Education in general, with particular emphasis on Food Hygiene has been pursued by the Sanitary Inspectors by private discussions with employers and employees in food establishments and by talks and lectures to various Public Bodies and Organisations and these efforts will be continued. Whilst the new legislation is welcomed, its implementation in the year ahead will tax our depleted staff of Sanitary Inspectors to the utmost for not only do food shops and food stalls, cafes and restaurants come within the scope of the new Act but in addition food premises previously outside the jurisdiction of food legislation now come within this administration. To stimulate food traders in raising standards of food hygiene a highly successful pictorial exhibition of food establishments was held in Shoreditch Town Hall for two days in November this year. Six neighbouring Metropolitan Boroughs co-operated and about 450 food traders and others visited the exhibition. The purpose of the exhibition was to display the improvements that traders were adopting to raise the standard of food hygiene and to encourage others to follow their good example. Many subsequent improvements in food premises during the year are known to be a direct result of this exhibition. The increasing publicity given in the Press to food hygiene resulted in the public bringing to the notice of the department many oases of alleged unsound food sold. Many of the articles brought to the notice of the sanitary inspectors contained trivial items of foreign substances but in all cases the complaints were fully investigated and although this entailed much valuable time it was felt that the time spent was well 43. worthwhile in encouraging the public to bring to the notice of the department any complaints regarding food hygiene. In several of the cases brought to our notice the purchasers were reluctant to give evidence in the Magistrates Court and without supporting proof as to the purchase of the article concerned no prosecution can be taken. In two cases (bread which contained a cigarette end, and a cake which contained a fly) summonses were issued and in each case the Magistrate found the offence proved. Fines of £3 and £2. 2s. Costs and £1 and £4. 4s. Costs respectively were made against the defendants. ANTI-FLY CAMPAIGN. The campaign to combat the fly nuisance was continued. By arrangement, and with the co-operation of the Transport and Cleansing Superintendent, all dustbins and dust chutes were dusted during the fly-breeding season with Gammexane after the receptacles had been emptied by the Council's dustmen. Owners of blocks of flats were again encouraged to take action against flies by purchasing insecticide supplied by the Public Health Department at cost price. Fly sprays were also sold to occupiers of food premises. FREE WASHING FACILITIES. Free washing facilities are installed in every public sanitary convenience in the Borough. These facilities are being made use of by an increasing number of users of the conveniences and are gradually becoming a regular feature in the use of the public conveniences. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF FOOD. 302 samples were submitted to the Public Analyst during the year, giving a rate of 6.6 per 1,000 population. These were as follows:- Ale and Stout 2, Almonds ground 1, Almond oil 1, Annato colouring fluid 1, Arrowroot 1, Aspirin tablets 1, Baking powder 2, Pearl barley 2, Beverages (fruit milk drink) 1, Blancmange powder 1, Boric Ointment 1, Bread 6, Bread rolls and butter 17, Butter 4, Cake mixture 3, Camphorated oil 1, Cascara Sagrada tablets 1, Castor oil 1, Cheese spread 1, 44.

Of the samples of milk taken, one was found to be deficient in milk fat and one was deficient in solids-not-fat. Warning letters were sent. A sample of bread submitted was found to contain a partly burnt cigarette end which had been baked in the loaf. Legal proceedings were instituted and the defendant was fined £3 and ordered to pay two guineas costs. Seven samples offered for sale as buttered rolls were found to be spread with margarine or with a mixture of margarine and butter. In one instance where the shop-keeper had previously been warned, legal proceedings were taken and he was fined £2 and ordered to pay five guineas costs, and in all other cases warning letters were sent. An informal sample of butter drops was found to contain no appreciable amount of butter, and after formal sample taken proved to be similar, legal proceedings were commenced, but summons had to be withdrawn owing to wrong information being given by the occupier of the shop which was later found to have been closed. Warning letters were sent in respect of two samples of liver sausage which were found to contain excessive sulphur dioxide. 45. UNSOUND FOOD, During the year 404 certificates were issued in respect of food unfit for human consumption, which included the following Meat 369 tins; 4 cwts. 19 lbs.; Ham 247 tins, 2 qtrs. 20¼ lbs.; Bacon 4 tons, 10 cwts., 2 qtrs., 7 lbs.; Poultry 1 cwt, 3 qtrs. 5 lbs.; Cheese 64 packets; 13 cwts. 1 qtr. 18 lbs.; Fruit 845 tins; Dried fruit 14 cwts. 2 qtrs. 8 lbs.; Preserves 27 lbs.; Fish 73 tins; Cereals 7 cwts. 1 qtr. 17 lbs.; Flour 3 cwts. 3 qtrs. 18 lbs.; Cake mixture 16 lbs.; Fat 83 packets; Margarine 3 cwts. 3 qtrs.; Vegetables 193 tins; Dried vegetables 3 cwts, 3 qtrs. 5 lbs.; Tapioca 2 cwts. 3 qtrs. 1 lb.; Almonds 2 qtrs.; Chinese egg albumen 3 qtrs. 21 lbs.; Coconut 2 qtrs. 13 lbs.; Essence 67 bottles; Table jelly 88 packets; Soup tins 1; Jam 1 cwt. 2 qtrs. 20 lbs.; Salad cream 59 bottles: Sauce 336 bottles; Milk 57 tins; Sugar 2 qtrs.; Cream 23 jars; Custard powder 5 packets. PRESERVATIVES IN FOOD REGULATIONS. All articles taken were in accordance with the Regulations. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933. 34 Licences were granted during the year. 57 inspections and visits were made, and general observation was kept of stalls and shops for unauthorised sellers, but no infringements were reported. PHARMACY AND MEDICINES ACT, 1941. Throughout the year a watch was kept for contraventions of the Act, but none was observed. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. There were seven premises licensed under this Act during the year. In four cases a considerable business is carried on, mostly in birds and goldfish, but the other three deal on a very small scale only, one in dogs and the others in pigeons. During the year 20 inspections were made of these premises, and in no case were the conditions of the licence being contravened. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. At the end of 1955 the number of registered premises where filling materials were used was 108, and during the year 11 licences were issued in respect of premises where rag flock is manufactured or stored. 62 Inspections of the premises were made. 14 samples of filling materials were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst. All were found to comply with the prescribed standards. 46. PUBLIC HEALTH PROPAGANDA. During the year Public Health propaganda was continued and extended. Five new Public Health notice boards were provided and fixed in positions on Council Estates. Public Health information posters are posted on the notice boards and during the year are changed several times. The Public Health Department also have a large notice board situated in the Town Hall and an E. M. B. board at St, John's churchyard, where propaganda posters are posted and changed regularly. In addition to this method of propaganda Public Health propaganda leaflets and book marks are distributed from the Public Libraries by arrangement with the Borough Librarian. From time to time circular letters are sent to various traders such as shopkeepers, stallholders, and in particular a special circular letter was sent out to all bakers advising them on methods of cleaning their utensils and apparatus. Talks were also given to mothers by the Deputy Chief Sanitary Inspector at the Model Welfare Centre, Kingsland Road and a visit was paid to the Town Hall by scholars of school leaving age from one of the local schools, who were shown over the Department by the Chief Sanitary Inspector and given an insight into the working of the Public Health Department. In the campaign against tuberculosis "Do Not Spit" notices were issued on request to replace posters already distributed. Sonne dysentery gave us an opportunity of spreading the gospel of personal cleanliness through interviews by the sanitary inspectors, and, by the distribution to each affected household of our own leaflets on food handling - especially the abbreviated one which summarises under five distinct headings. The longer leaflet has been posted up, as well as distributed, in all premises where food-handlers work. We were also given an opportunity of boosting diphtheria immunisation by the occurrence (after a 5 year lapse) of a case of diphtheria where the germ was brought home by a carrier. With the help of the "Hackney Gazette" and of the Council's monthly "Newsletter", the local immunisation clinics had temporarily quite a rush of applicants. STUDENT SANITARY INSPECTORS. In 1946, the Borough Council, through the Public Health Committee, commenced a scheme for the training of potential Sanitary Inspectors and since then we have taken a maximum number of three student Sanitary Inspectors for each course. 47. The students are appointed in the first instance as clerks in the General Grade and if after a period of service they are considered satisfactory, they are appointed as student Sanitary Inspectors. During the first year they are expected to make themselves proficient in shorthand and typing. In the second year they attend a course of training in building construction and the last two years are spent on a theoretical course of training in preparation for taking the Royal Sanitary Institute and Sanitary Inspectors' Examination Joint Board examination. The first of these two years is devoted, to work in the office in connection with Sanitary Inspectors' work in conjunction with their part-time attendance at a recognised Institute and during the last year of their course they are given a full comprehensive training on the work of each district Sanitary Inspector and the specialist inspectors on a rota system. Financial assistance is given in accordance with the National Joint Council's Scheme of Conditions of Service. FOOD & DRUGS (MILK & DAIRIES) ACT, 1944. MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATIONS) ACT, 1949.
