That in consequence of proceedings which have from time to time taken place with regard to disorderly houses, the Overseers' report that they have taken into consideration a scheme by which no doubt a considerable sum might be saved to the ratepayers, if they had an officer whom at an early stage of the proceedings they could direct to make inquiries and serve notices, which duties were not included in the schedule of duties which Mr. Milton had to perform. That your Committee are informed and believe that the Overseers' are not legally justified in employing a separate officer, and paying him a separate salary tor the work they desire to be included for the new Beadle.

This objection however does not apply to the wide thoroughfares to 2 OCTOBER, 1891. 137 "which I refer, and on behalf of this Association, I "earnestly hope your Vestry may see its way to carry "out the suggestions I have made.

I think the Committee should seriously consider if our present staff will be large enough to carry out the duties that the new Act will devolve on us. My own opinion is that we require additional help; at the present time our Inspectors have a large amount of their time taken up with clerical work, such as preparing Notices, filling in Report Books, &c., all of which could be done by a clerk, and so they would be able to give more time to the inspection of the district. There is one clause of the Act which pointedly states that each Sanitary Authority is required to appoint an adequate number of Inspectors, that being part of the Act. I can only give you my advice and say that to carry out and work the "Public Health Act, 1891," as it is required to be done, our present staff is not sufficient." That having regard to such Report, and after careful consideration, your Committee resolved to recommend—That a 226 20 JANUARY, 1892.

VESTRY OF THE Bomlet of Mile End Old Town SURVEYOR'S DEPARTMENT. the ANNUAL REPORT or THE SURVEYOR TO THE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1892. LONDON: PRINTED BY E. S. WHEATLEY, 176, MILE END ROAD, E. 1892. REPORT. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, In laying before you a statement of the various works carried out under the direction of my department, it is a regret to me that the funds at your disposal have not enabled me to execute more paving works. For some years past your desire has been (and this, doubtless, a commendable desire) to reduce to the utmost the estimates for renewals of roads and footways; but it is my duty to warn you that your renewals of footways, in particular, are not keeping pace with the wear upon them, and that you will leave to your successors an accumulation of such work. CARRIAGEWAY PAVING. No new carriageway paving has been undertaken during the year. PAVING WORKS. The following works have been executed by your own men : New paving squared and laid 19,224 ft. sup. Old do. taken up and relaid 43,478 ,, Ditto, redressed and relaid 887 „ New curb 41 ft. run. Old curb relaid 6,415 ,, Ditto, redressed and relaid 1,638 „ Pitching relaid and partly redressed 4,381 yds. sup. Old channels relaid 5,125 ft. run. Tees Scoriœ Brick channels and crossings 1,734 yds. sup. The cost was, for labour £1,479 11 0 „ „ material 1,002 17 3 £2,482 8 3 322 MAIN ROADS. You have only one Road which is a Main Road by Act of Parliament, viz.: Commercial Road; and this the County Council are liable to maintain. You are entitled to elect to maintain the Road, and receive the cost from the Council; and you did so elect. The Council, however, only offer you the sum formerly paid by the Treasury as a contribution in aid of disturnpiked roads, viz.: £257 11s. per annum. The cost of cleansing and watering this Road for the past year was £499 11s. 6d., to this must be added the cost of maintaining the carriage and footways. The Council have the power, on your application, to declare any road a Main Road, and therefore reparable at the cost of the county; and it seems difficult to think that at any rate the Mile End Road which is the great highway from London to Essex and all the Eastern Counties, should not be deemed a Main Road. An Arbitrator appointed by the Board of Trade will most likely have to decide the amount to be paid to you in respect of the Commercial Road. HORSE KEEPING. The cost of keeping the Vestry's horses was as follows:– Stock in hand, 25th March, 1891 42 18 11 Rent of stables 130 0 0 Wages 315 7 5 Superintendent's salary 225 0 0 Corn 628 6 8 Hay, straw, and clover 675 18 11 Greenmeat 53 10 7 Bran and oatmeal 55 15 6 Beans 106 5 0 Veterinary and shoeing 140 10 7 Rates, taxes, coals, gas, water, repairs, &c. 158 15 3 Insurances 8 1 9 Depreciation of stock 319 13 0 2,860 3 7 Less sale of dung 8 15 0 „ stock in hand, 25th March, 1892 159 1 2 167 16 2 £2,692 7 5 Cost per horse is equal to 5/6½ per day, 323 The work done was equal to 9,714 working days for one horse. The time was divided as follows:– 1,109 days for drawing materials for road repairs. 3,411 „ carting street refuse. 4,053 „ „ house refuse. 1,141 „ watering roads. 9,714 THE FOLLOWING TABLES will show the cost of Road Watering, Repairs, Scavenging and Removal of Dust for the past three years. With reference to the cost of Road Watering, it has remained nearly constant. Road Repairs have increased, owing to the advance in the price of Guernsey Granite, and increased quantity used consequent on the increase of traffic. 324 ROAD WATERING. 1890. 1891. 1892. £ s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d.

The cost for labour for clearing away Snow was £373 11s. 3d. Twenty tons of salt were used, and cost £28 8/-. The quantity of Snow which fell during the past winter was not great, and only such as could be easily dealt with; but the obligation upon you under a recent Act may entail an enormous cost, and, in my judgment, not be so satisfactory as the system under which every householder was responsible for the removal of Snow from in front of his own house. 329 REMOVAL OF DUST. The quantity of refuse collected from houses by your carts and men during the year was 15,983 loads, being 540 loads more than were collected in 1890-1.

This is equal to about 2/7¾ per load for collection and carting. This is equal to nearly 2/85/4 per load for collection and cartage. 330 DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. There is no question which at this time is causing greater trouble to many of the Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis than this. Some are acquiring land at Rainham, others beyond Gravesend, and taking the material there to be used for filling up land. Barges, steam-tugs and cranes are used for this purpose, the cost of which is serious to contemplate. The arrangements you made some years ago have enabled you to successfully clear your District at a comparatively low cost, and this amount should not be very largely increased, although that of removing dust will doubtless increase as recent legislation imposes greater obligations on those charged with this work. The quantity of ashes and breeze sifted and put on rail was 6,990 tons, and 1,120 tons were loaded into barges and sold for brick making purposes. 2,562 tons were loaded into barges and sent to Shoot. 1,461 tons of rough dust were disposed of by rail and 600 tons of clinkers were removed free of charge from the Wharf. The two furnaces for burning light refuse, which were constructed three years ago, were found to be such a success that you have erected two others 011 the same plan, the cost has been £422 6s. id. These furnaces are capable of burning 24 tons per day, and reducing this quantity to 4 tons. At the present time you are not burning more than 18 tons per day, thus keeping one furnace to be cleared out of clinkers each day. I am in the hope that by the adoption of mechanical bars this quantity will be increased 50 per cent. Hitherto there has not been any great difficulty of disposing of the clinkers. I he total cost of disposing of the Refuse was as follows: £ s. d. Carriage and other disposal of refuse 668 12 4 Sifting, loading, and burning 1190 12 9 Rent of Wharf 130 0 0 Rent of Arch 10 0 0 1,999 5 1 Less amount received and receivable for sale of ashes, breeze, rough dust, and clinkers 338 14 5 £1,660 10 8 33i DISPOSAL OF STREET REFUSE. Rent of Shoots— £ s. d. Carpenters Company's land 66 0 0 Ditto, Great Eastern Railway proportion of £50 30 0 0 £96 0 0 A much larger provision will have to be made in the future under this head. LIGHTING. The public lamps, 1,004 number, have been supplied, lighted, cleaned, and repaired by the Commercial Gas Company at a cost of £3,646 5s. 4d. STEAM ROLLER. Your roller has worked 227 days on your own roads and has been let on hire 19½ days. The cost for labour and fuel has been £183 2s. 10d. Repairs £41 15s. 9d. The machine is now fairly worn out, and a new one will have to be provided in the coming year; it has, however, been an excellent investment for the Vestry, but a modern one would save £80 a year in labour alone. SEWERS. A work of great importance in the Commercial Road has been completed, a new invert has been put in from the New Road to Jamaica Street. Two Hushing tanks, one at Cannon Street Road and the other at Sidney Street, have been constructed at the joint cost of St. George's Vestry and yourselves. The old sewer in Sidney Street has been broken up and a new one substituted, the cost of this work was £1937. The only portion of the District subject to flooding at times of ordinary storm is Ben Jonson Road and the lower part of Harford Street. The sewage from these Streets is carried under the Regent's Canal by a syphon which there is 110 means of cleansing, and it is only reasonable to suppose that in the course of the eighty years it has existed, must be considerably reduced in area by deposit. I have made various representations to the County Council on this subject and am now assured that plans are ready for altering the flow of these sewers. The cost of cleansing and repairing the sewers including small works of construction and reconstruction has been £881 12s. 3d. 332 Fifty-seven houses have been connected with the sewers of this Hamlet. I have the honour to be Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JNO. M. KNIGHT, Surveyor. VESTRY OF THE Bomlet of Mile End Old Town ANNUAL REPORT UPON THE public health, AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1891, BY THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED BY E. S. WHEATLEY, 176 MILE END ROAD, E. 1892. the thirty-sixth ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Year 1891. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Annual Report on the vital statistics and sanitary condition of the Hamlet, for the year 1891. In doing so, I would draw your attention to the fact that this year the vital statistics have an especial significance, inasmuch as 1 am enabled to lay before you the exact population at the present time, and from which the statistics in the following Report are based. POPULATION. Before dealing with either the rate of Births, or the rate of Mortality, it is necessary that one should have an accurate knowledge of the population of a district; owing to the census being taken but once in ten years, in the interval we can make only an approximate estimate, and that has found to be very far from correct during the last decade in the various Sanitary districts in London. In our own district the population had very far from increased in the same proportion during the last ten years, as it did in the ten years from 1871 to 1881, as the following table will show: population compared as to increase during last forty years. 1861 to 1871 increase 20,082. 1871 to 1881 „ 12,427. 1881 to 1891 „ 1,992. 4 By the courtesy of the officials engaged on the census I am enabled to lay before you the following interesting particulars relating to the census of this year.

The number of Births registered during the past year was 4,109, giving a Birth Rate of 38.2 per 1,000 per annum. It is an astonishing fact that in our district the Birth Rate is nearly double the Death Rate, this year being no exception. In my last year's Report I drew up a Table showing this anomaly for the last ten years. DEATHS AND DEATH RATE. The Deaths registered from all causes in Mile End Old Town were 2,067. These figures are the gross; and in order to get the exact number of Deaths that belong to Mile End Old Town, regard must be paid to the persons who died in Public Institutions, such as Hospitals, Asylums, Infirmaries not in our district, but which were admitted from Mile End; and on the other hand, the patients who died in the Public Institutions in our district such as City of London Infirmary, Jewish Home, and Portuguese Home, are to be considered; that being worked out I find that the number of Deaths belonging to our Hamlet was 2,289, giving a Death Rate of 21.2 per 1,000. The Death Rate of the Metropolis for the same period was 21.0. That we compare very favourably with the Metropolis, and also other East End districts, the following table will show : Total number of Deaths from all causes for year 1891. Population according to the Census. Death Rate per 1,000 inhabitants. LONDON 88,760 4,221,452 21.0 MILE END OLD TOWN 2,289 107,565 21.2 Shoreditch 3,068 124,009 24.7 Bethnal Green 3,282 129,134 25.4 Whitechapel 1,877 74,462 25.2 St. George-in-the-East 1,338 45,546 29.0 Limehouse 1,446 57,599 25.1 Poplar 3,522 166,697 21.1 ZYMOTIC DISEASES. It will be seen on perusing the Table of Mortality, that during the year the number of deaths from Zymotic Diseases was less than previous years; and although we must not be too sanguine, still, 1 think we may lay claim to part of this diminution being due to the improved sanitary condition of our district. The fact that only a total of eighty deaths occurred during the year from the four principal Zymotic Diseases out of a population of 107,000 speaks for itself. 6 SMALL POX. It is two years since we had a case of Small Pox occur in our district. During the past year we had six cases notified, the first was that of a child in Nelson Street; the patient was removed at once to the Hospital Ships, and the rooms thoroughly disinfected, the house was very dirty, there were two families in the house, a number of children, amongst which were two babies unvaccinated; with the mother's consent I vaccinated both these; and although every enquiry was made as to the origin of the disease, I could not trace its source. About a week after the child was removed the father was sent for to the Hospital to see his son, as he was not expected to recover; exactly twelve days after, the father showed symptons of the disease, and was removed to the Hospital, where both the child and father died. Before the man was taken away he begged his wife not to visit him, there can be but little doubt the father contracted the disease through his visiting the Hospital; and I cannot help but think in a case of this kind, when the mental depression is severe, and the system out of health, the visitor is most susceptible to take the disease. I may point out the child who died was not vaccinated. The next case was that of a child in Myrdle Street, which occurred in November, I at once visited the house, and the mother wished me to see the child, as she had given the doctor who certified it up, and had another attending who had stated the child had Chicken Pox; I did so, and agreed with the opinion of the second medical man, and ascertained that a fortnight previous another child had had Chicken Pox in the same house. I then saw the first doctor and after a little explanation he agreed to withdraw the certificate. The other three cases occurred in a house in Sidney Square; first one child was notified, and was isolated at the top of the house. 1 visited the premises, and the mother who opened the door to me was nursing the child, two other children of hers were playing in the street, I explained to her the danger of mixing with the other children herself, and about a week afterwards these two children were attacked, all these recovered: they had been vaccinated. SCARLET FEVER. The number of cases of this disease notified during the year was 232 : 49 of which were removed to Homerton Isolation Hospital, the disease was of a mild type, and very generally distributed all over the Hamlet; in fact, it was prevalent in about the same proportion all over the Metropolis; the deaths that occurred were only 12, which is a remarkable small mortality for this disease. 7 DIPHTHERIA. The number of deaths from this disease was 36 ; and the number notified, 105. This disease is more fatal than Scarlet Fever. 31 of these cases were removed to the Fever Hospitals. TYPHOID FEVER. The number of deaths from this disease was 22 during the year, out of 101 notified to us. As defective drainage is one of the principal sources of infection, it is very necessary when we get notification of a case that the drains should be properly tested, this is being carried out in every house where the disease occurs. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. By the provisions of the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, I am at once acquainted with the cases as they arise, during the past year we have had a large number reported to us; and I have no doubt that owing to the prompt action, which was adopted in each particular case to prevent the spread of the disease, was successful. Although a large number of these cases was notified, we had not, during the year, what might be termed an epidemic. These diseases were common to the whole of the Metropolis. From the returns which I get from the Asylums Board of all cases notified in London each week, I am enabled to see at once in which districts they are occurring. Scarlet Fever has been very general all through the year; I should like to have introduced into my Report a copy of map of the Hamlet, showing the exact locality of each of these diseases, but found it impracticable. I have, however, in my office, this map, showing the different diseases, and localizing them. The houses where these diseases occurred, for the most part were found to be in a very good sanitary state, where defects were found, notices were served, and the necessary works carried out. Our system of disinfection has been much improved of late, notices are served on each house, drawing the attention to the provisions of the Act; and a post card left for the occupants to fill up when the patient is well enough to leave the room: this is returned to me, and the disinfector, after burning sulphur in the room for twentyfour hours, removes the clothing, and this is brought to our oven, subjected to a high temperature, and returned to the owner. The means of conveying the clothing through the street has been likewise much improved, and is less objectionable than the old iron truck; the two hand carts are respectable looking carts, we find very little difficulty in disinfecting in nearly seventy per cent, of the cases notified; this to be done voluntarily speaks well for the common sense of the inhabitants, and is also due to the ready help I find that is given by the medical men in most cases in recommending the householder to submit to our doing the disinfection instead of themselves. 8 Infectious Diseases notified under the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, during year 1891.

Houses found to be in a good sanitary condition 33 6l 113 172 Houses in which the following sanitary defects occurred and afterward remedied:— (1) The same cisterns supplying the closets and also the drinking water to the house 8 3 3 3 (2) Sinks found to be in direct connection with the drain 13 0 0 1 (3) Houses dirty and dilapidated 2 4 1 2 (4) Drains found defective 4 2 1 4 (5) No proper water-supply to W.C 0 1 0 0 Total 57 71 118 182 11 In the East Ward.— The houses taken as a whole are now in a very fair sanitary condition, although parts of the district require frequent visiting. During the last year hundreds of the better built houses were found to be using the water for drinking purposes from the same cistern as that supplying the W.C., and also the sink-pipes were in direct communication with the drains. The average number of persons living in each house in the Ward was7.9 per house. In the West Ward.— The houses principally occupied by Foreign Jews were very frequently visited, and I am pleased to say that we find that these people, thanks to the Jewish Board of Guardians and other sources, are being taught habits of cleanliness and are becoming Anglicized with the result that the houses on the whole are much more cleanly and the premises in a better sanitary condition than formerly. Average persons per house 7.9. In the South Ward.— A large number of houses in this Ward have been inspected and I think I may say that practically all the houses in this Ward have a proper separate water supply to their W.C.'s, and are otherwise in a fair sanitary state. Average number of persons per house 6*9. The Centre Ward.— It is in this Ward that a large proportion of the houses need our constant vigilance in order to keep free from epidemic disease, partly owing to the dilapidated state of some of the property and partly owing to the thoughtlessness, wilfulness, and dirty habits of some of the tenants; the streets I allude to are Lomas Buildings, Ocean Street, Knott Street, Duckett Street, and Cadiz Street, if this area or most of it could be dealt with as an insanitary one, it would do away with most of your dilapidated dwellings. It will be remembered that in my previous Annual Report I pointed to the fact that I had reported Lomas Buildings as being an insanitary area, and that there was not enough light nor air to the dwellings. I am at present engaged preparing the statistics of mortality of this locality, with a view of bringing it forward under the Housing of the Working Classes Act if possible. Other parts of the Centre Ward have been visited and many improvements have been carried out. Average persons occupying each house, 7.3 The North Ward.— Most of the property in this Ward is in a very good state; during the year the worst parts have been inspected, and sanitary improvements carried out. The number of persons averaged occupying each house is 7.0. 12 WORKS CARRIED OUT BY THE SANITARY INSPECTORS Under the "Nuisances Removal Act, 1855," in their respective districts.

It is under this Act that the greater part of the work has been carried out during the year; our ordinary practice has been to serve the Vestry's orders on the premises, and when the work has not been done on reinspection to write to the owners, and 30 give a little more time than the twenty-eight days. In extreme cases, when the nuisance was so bad as to be immediately dangerous to the health of the occupants of the premises, it was deemed advisable, where no part of the order of the Vestry had been executed, to at once take proceedings. The table below will explain itself in each case. In all cases where proceedings were taken I personally "inspected the premises and I attended the Police Court with your Clerk and Inspector. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. From the Table appended it will be seen that Part II. of the Act has been put into force from time to time during the year; so far as our limited experience of this portion of the Act went —referring to houses that are unfit for human habitation—we found great benefit, because in many cases we did, without much delay, either compel the owners to make the premises habitable, or compel them to close them up : some of the premises that were reported on were not fit for animals to live in, let alone human beings; I am glad to say this class of property is fast dying out in our district. It will be remembered that the Act came into operation about the middle of 1891, and the Vestry appointed the Sanitary Committee under the Act to take all proceedings on their behalf, with the exception of those requiring the Seal of the Vestry, so that up to the present time the Vestry have not been made acquainted with what proceedings have been taken under it. I take this opportunity of laying the Table appended before you, which speaks for itself; in all cases notices have to be first served on1 the owners, and a copy sent to the London County Council, and when Police Court proceedings were taken your Clerk and myself attended, with the result as follows :— PROCEEDINGS TAKEN UNDER THE HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT.

During the last year this Act has been put into operation, we have already a number of houses under this Act which are visited from time to time, and are being kept in a fair sanitary condition. I reported to the Vestry that a large number of the houses 111 Ernest Street and Lydia Street were being occupied by two and in some cases three families, the Vestry passed the necessary orders and the provisions of the Act were served on each house; all these houses were inspected by your Inspector and myself, and particulars obtained as to their cubic capacity, etc., we did not find any overcrowding to exist, but many sanitary defects were found which the Act provided against, the necessary notices were served in each case and the works have now been executed. ARTIZAN DWELLINGS. We have in our district a number of block dwellings which are occupied by the Artizan Class, as perhaps, many Vestrymen are not acquainted with their locality and the particulars of their occupation I append the following table; all these tenements have been visited during the year, and, taken as a whole, were found to be in a very fair sanitary state. In the Grove buildings some or the lower rooms are dark, but various alterations are in progress which will remedy this defect, and in the Mile End Buildings sanitary defects were found which have now been remedied.

Before dealing with the epidemic during the present year, it would be well to look back to the previous years; it will be remembered that this supposed Miasmatic disease reached our shores in an epidemic form at the latter end of 1889, and continued during the early part of 1890, it was called the " Russian Influenza," probably deriving part of its nomenclature from the fact that it was in Russia that the disease occurred previous to its becoming acute in this country. Prior to its appearance in London, in many stables during October, 1889, there occurred the disease known as influenza among horses ; I personally saw a number of animals in several large establishments in our district in that month with this disease, whose principal symptoms were high temperature, excessive weakness and cough. Three months later the influenza spread with alarming rapidity through households in London. The disease was soon found to be highly infectious, with an incubation period of from three to six days. In most of the cases that came under my notice I found that the malady was ushered in with a high temperature varying from 102° to 105° (normal temperature being 98.4°), rigors, frontal headache, pains in the back, and great prostration followed by cough, and, if neglected with inflammation of the respiratory organs. It was about the middle of December that it first appeared in England. In London at the commencement of the new year it spread very rapidly, reached its height about the first week which was maintained for about a fortnight, then abruptly declined about the third week in January. It may be described as coming like a wave, which remained at its height a fortnight then disappeared as suddenly as it came. With regard to Influenza, although the disease is more or less always prevalent in the winter months, it is thirty-nine years ago since it assumed anything approaching an epidemic form, at which time it will be seen from the table below (compiled by Dr. Parsons, Local Government Board,) the mortality was only half that of the year 1890, although in 1847 and 1848 the deaths were 1,253 and 659 respectively.

The deaths during this epidemic are shewn in the following table: MORTALITY FROM INFLUENZA IN MILE END OLD TOWN AND LONDON RESPECTIVELY. Week ending 1891. MILE END OLD TOWN. LONDON.

It is to be greatly regretted that up to the present time we are practically in the dark as to the means of preventing this scourge, so that with this disease upon us it has to be dealt with as each practitioner thinks fit; that it is, in a measure, of malarial origin I think most medical men are agreed, attacking especially the nerve centres and vital organs. I am glad to hear that inquiry has already been commenced by the Medical Department of the Local Government Board, with a view to discovering its origin and to take the best means for checking its prevalence. SANITARY LEGISLATION DURING THE YEAR 1891. The principal legislation carried through by Parliament during the year are two of the most important Acts as affecting sanitation that have been entered 011 the Statute Book: The Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Factory and Workshops Act, 1891. The Public Health Act is a measure which consolidates and amends the Sanitary Acts, the Nuisance Removal Act, the Infectious Disease Prevention Act, and a number of other Acts over thirty in number which are either in part or wholly amended. I don't know how many of the members of the Vestry are acquainted with the provisions of these Acts, but in as brief a manner as possible I propose to bring the most important parts to your notice which we shall have to deal with as a Sanitary Authority. 20 By Section I:— We are compelled to make from time to time inspection of our district, and whatever nuisances are found to exist, provide for the abatement thereof, so as to secure the proper sanitary condition of "all premises within the district." By Section 24:— In addition to the ordinary nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily, it is provided that factories, fire-places and furnaces which do not consume their own smoke, shall be so dealt with as nuisances. By Section 29:— It is the duty of the Sanitary Authority to keep the streets of their district clean, including the footways, and to collect all street refuse, and this Section also provides that when such streets are not properly swept, cleansed and refuse collected, the Sanitary Authority shall be liable to a fine of twenty pounds. By Section 48:— Provides that when a dwelling house is without a proper water-supply the house shall be declared unfit for human habitation. By Section 49 :— Compels the Water Company in every case where they cut off the water-supply to any house, within 24 hours to give notice to the Sanitary Authority in writing. By Section 55 :— Deals with Infectious Disease Notification, and is similar to that in t he " Prevention of Infectious Disease Act, 1890," and provides that when a case of infectious disease, viz.: Scarlet Fever, Small Pox, Diphtheria, Continued Fever, Erysipelas, or Typhoid Fever, occurs in any house, it is-the duty of the head of the family also the medical man attending to notify to the Medical Officer of Health forthwith, under a penalty of a fine of forty shillings, it is also incumbent on the Medical Officer of Health to forward to the Metropolitan Asylums' Board a copy of the certificate, and also where there are children a similar copy to the schools they attend. By Section 60 and 61:— Relates principally to the disinfection of premises after infectious disease, and provides that the clothing, etc., if disinfected by the Sanitary Authority, shall be after disinfection brought back and delivered to the owner free of charge. By Section 62 :— (2) Makes it imperative that the Sanitary Authority shall cause notice to be served on every house where infectious disease exists, calling the attention of the house- \ 21 holder to the necessity of disinfecting any rubbish that has been infected by infectious disease, before being thrown in the ash-pit. By Sections 39 and 50:— It is made compulsory for the Local Authority to make bye-laws as to cleansing of cisterns, keeping waterclosets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action, and also enacts that the County Council shall make bye-laws with respect to waterclosets, earthclosets, cesspools, and receptacles for dung, and the proper accessories in connection with buildings. By Section 63:— Deals with the letting of any house where infectious disease has existed without being disinfected, and renders the persons letting the house liable to a fine of twenty pounds. By Section 68 :— Renders a person liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds, who wilfully exposes himself in any street, public place or inn whilst suffering from any dangerous infectious disease, or who gives, lends, sells, removes any bedding or articles which have been exposed to infection. By Section 88 :— Every Sanitary Authority shall provide a mortuary for the reception of dead bodies, and they may make by-laws with respect to the management of the same. ' By Section 90:— Any Sanitary Authority may, and if required by the County Council shall provide and maintain a proper building (other than a workhouse), for the reception of dead bodies during the time required to conduct a post-mortem examination. By Section 92 :— That the County Council shall provide and maintain proper accommodation for the holding of inquests, and may by agreement with the Sanitary Authority, provide and maintain the same in connection with a mortuary or a building for post-mortem examinations provided by that Authority. By Section 96 :— Deals with the occupation of underground rooms as dwellings, and provides that any underground room that was not occupied or let separately before January, ist, 1892, must have three feet of its height above the surface of the street; every wall must be constructed with a proper damp course; the soil below the room must be effectually drained, and such room must be effectually secured against the rising 22 of effluvia; and be properly ventilated, must have one or more windows opening directly into the external air; and other very stringent hygienic provisions. By Section 97:— It is the duty of an Officer of the Sanitary Authority, when appointed by the Authority for the purpose, to report at such times and in such manner as he may be ordered, all cases in which underground rooms are occupied contrary to this Act. By Section 99:— (3 and 4.) In these two sub-sections it is enacted that the Sanitary Authority may appoint a Committee for the purpose of the Act, to serve and receive notices, take proceedings and empower any officer to make complaints and take proceedings on their behalf. By Section 100:— Gives the London County Council power to supersede the Sanitary Authority, where that Authority has failed to enforce any bye-laws, and do any act which such Authority should have done, and to recover from the Sanitary Authority such expenses as they may incur in so doing. Section 107:— (1) Enacts that the Sanitary Authority shall appoint an adequate number of Inspectors. (2) The Local Government Board on representation from the County Council, alter local enquiry, if satisfied that the Sanitary Authority have failed to appoint a sufficient number of Inspectors, may order the Authority to appoint such number of additional Inspectors, and to allow such remuneration as the order directs. Having now given you a short synopsis of the Act, it will be readily observed that many new and onerous duties are cast upon my department. The first Section may be said to be the keystone of the Working of the whole Act: it is obvious from this, that it is our duty to ensure that every house in the Hamlet, shall be in a proper sanitary condition; if this is to be carried out properly, we must have additional assistance in my department, for with 14,000 houses to inspect, and to keep an accurate record of each premises, it will take a number of years to get once through the Hamlet; we have quite 2,000 houses that require visiting twice a year, and roughly, about 5,000, that ought to be visited once a year, and the rest at any rate every two years, to do this we must have extra assistance. Our present Inspectors have inspected about 4,500 houses during last year, this with the clerical work necessarily takes up their time; they with me are anxious that the Hamlet shall be in an efficient 23 sanitary state, and no doubt they are using their best endeavours to carry out the work allotted to them. I think I may be permitted to say that the Sanitary Committee have taken into their consideration the increased work thrown upon us by the Act, and they have in hand at the present time the question of providing additional assistance, either by clerical aid, or by recommending the appointment of additional Inspectors; my view is, that by taking all the clerical duties from our present Inspectors, it will allow them to devote their whole time to inspecting and re-inspecting the district, and at the same time will enable us to have kept a continuous systematic record of every house in the district; and I can only say that as far as my endeavours go I shall try to carry out the Act as efficiently as our limited staff will allow, and I know I can count on the assistance of the Inspectors in helping me to do this. THE FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT. This Act imposes many new and important duties on Sanitary Authorities that were previously carried out by the Government Inspectors, we are now made responsible for the systematic inspection of workshops, to see they are kept in a cleanly condition, that they have a proper number of conveniences, and particularly so where male and female labour is employed in one workshop. I am required to forward to the Local Government Board certificates where women are employed in workshops in our district; I propose to have these workshops inspected twice a year. BAKEHOUSES. We have 84 bakehouses in our district; I have, during the past year, visited them, and find them taken as a whole in a very good sanitary condition ; and I can safely say that although my visits were at all times and at all hours, I observed the greatest cleanliness amongst the employees; the bakehouses are all well lighted and ventilated, and whilst a few of them required whitewashing, for the most part they were very clean and wholesome. SLAUGHTER AND COW-HOUSES. Although the Vestry is not directly concerned in granting licences to the above kind of premises, yet, in order to ensure the sanitary condition of the district, before licenses are granted by the County Council, it is necessary that we should visit these premises and give our approval or otherwise to their being granted: with the Inspectors I have visited all of them in the district and found them to be in a good sanitary condition, and so I advised the Sanitary Committee not to offer any objection to the licences being renewed. 24 In conclusion, I have to thank you for the courtesy rendered to me during the past twelve months, and likewise for the assistance and support you have given me in the discharge of my duties. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. SANITARY INSPECTORS' REPORT for the year 1891-1892.
