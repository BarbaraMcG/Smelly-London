Metropolis Local Management Art. BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT. THE EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT. LONDON: PRINTED BY ASH & FLINT, LONDON BRIDGE, S.E. MDCCCLXIV. THE EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE St. Sabiour's District Board of Works. RESPECTFULLY PRESENTED TO THE INHABITANTS. The. Board of Works for the St. Saviour's District, pursuant to the 198 sect. of the Metropolis Local Management Act, submit their Eighth Annual Report to the Inhabitants of the District; showing the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board for the twelve months ending on the 25th March. Annexed also are the Reports of the Medical Officer and Surveyor. The Board desire in the first place to call attention to the able Report of their Medical Officer. His account of the state of health in the District cannot fail to bo highly satisfactory to all. Appended to his Report, in a tabulated form, are statistics showing the number of deaths registered in the District and elsewhere during the past year: also a statement of the sanitary works that have been carried out by himself and the Inspector. In the Report of the Surveyor, there will be found a statement of the proceedings of the Board in his department during the year, and the description and quantity of materials expended. In addition to these particulars, the Board desire to lay before the Inhabitants a succinct account of their principal operations. Since their last Report, a considerable improvement has been made in Upper Ground Street and the Commercial Road, by the purchase and pulling down of the house No. 1, Broadwall, which abutted on those streets, and throwing open a portion of the site thereof to the public. The purchase-money of the house was £450, a sum sufficiently economical, looking to the results, and of this the Metropolitan Board will no doubt contribute a portion in consideration of the public improvement effected. The surplus ground not taken into the public way will be available for letting. 4 The London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company having required the late stoneyard in Surrey Row, the Board disposed of the same to them at the price of £295. The Board, consequent upon encroachments made by the same Company, have obtained agreements from them securing the carrying out of improvements in the public way in Robert Street and Church Street. The Company have also carried out improvements in Surrey Row. Such portion of Stamford Street as is within the District has been paved with granite by Messrs. Mowlem & Co., one of the Contractors of the Board, under their existing contract. Looking to the importance of this thoroughfare and its immediate connection with Southwark Street, this is thought to bo a step in the right direction. The Board have also to report that they have taken of the Charing Cross Railway Company four arches in Ewer Street, for the purposes of a Stone yard, and hope that these will afford greater security for the preservation of the property of the Board, as well as greater facility for the deposit and arrangement of the stone and other materials, than has hitherto been attainable. A rather heavy charge has lately devolved upon the Board, for on the 20th May last, the Metropolitan Board formally resigned the control and jurisdiction of Southwark Street to the District Board, and gave notice that from that day the expenses of lighting, cleansing, and repairing it would fall upon the District Board, consequently, the latter had to take immediate steps for the watering and cleansing of the street by their own contractors, and also for the lighting of it. The Board, however, feel that they have reason to congratulate the Inhabitants of the District on the acquisition of so noble a thoroughfaro as Southwark Street. Already considerable progress has been made in the disposal of the ground-plots by the Metropolitan Board, and large handsome structures are continually springing up. Those flanking the High Street would not discredit a far more pretentious neighbourhood than the ancient Borough of Southwark. Indeed it may be said that the status of the Borough is improved by their erection. Doubtless, ere long, the greater portion of the vacant ground in Southwark Street will be covered with valuable property; a matter of no small importance to the ratepayers, for being of a high rateable capacity, it will not fail to yield a considerable return in aid of the local rates. In July, 1868, an Act for limiting the hours of labour of young persons employed in Bakehouses, and for enforcing cleanliness and ventilation of Bakehouses was passed:—also an Act for amending 6 the Nuisances Removal Act, with respect to the seizure of diseased and unwholesome meat. Both Acts invested the Local Authorities with power to enforce the provisions thereof. The Board had abstracts of the first mentioned Act printed and circulated among the bakers and confectioners in the district; and the Medical Officer, as will be seen on reference to his Report, made an inspection of the Bakehouses, Slaughter-houses, &c., and sanitary measures resulted therefrom in several instances. During the present Session of Parliament the Board have presented |petitions as under, viz.:—Opposing the Bill introduced by the Home Secretary for the Amalgamation of the City Police with the Metropolitan—Urging the Abolition of the Duty on Fire Insurances —Opposing the Bill to alter the mode of collection of Land Tax, Assessed Taxes, and Income Tax. Memorials also have been presented to the Home Secretary, complaining of the employment of the Police for the protection of pugilists; and to the Metropolitan Board of Works in favour of the introduction of a Bill to provide for superannuation allowances, in certain events, to Officers of Vestries and District Boards. The tenant of the "George" Public House, in Gravel Lane, having erected a building or skittle-ground in front of his house beyond the general line of frontage, in contravention of the 143rd clause of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Board, in May last, pursuant to a Magistrate's order, pulled down such building and removed the materials to the Stone-yard. A list of Contracts; the names and addresses of the Members of the Board, and other particulars, will bo found at the end. Board Room, Emerson Street, 24th June, 1864.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Notwithstanding the extensive prevalence of Small Pox which marked the beginning of the year 1863, and the very severe visitation of fever at its close, it affords me pleasure to have to report that the deaths registered in the District were fewer by ninety than in the year preceding. The total mortality was 828, against 918 in the year 1862. Of these 696 died in their own homes, 106 in the Workhouse, and 26 in Guy's Hospital. In consequence of the removal of St. Thomas's Hospital, the registration of persons in the District, who previously lived in other parishes, is 82 less than in the preceding year; so that the decrease in the number of deaths of persons previously resident is 55. It must be observed, however, that the numbers for the past year extend over a period of 53 weeks; and, if for the purpose of comparison, 15 deaths are deducted from the number registered, there appears an actual decrease of 70. The mortality of the District during the eight years your Board has been in operation has been respectively 868, 920, 1,047, 996, 929, 1,066, 918 and 828. The deaths of the year 1863 are therefore fewer by 40 than in any former year, and 135 less than the average of the seven years preceding. Possibly this result may to some extent bo referred to a diminished population; but it should bo remembered, that the larger portion of the dwellings which have disappeared from the District were either taken down or empty at the date of the census, and that, since that time, the excess of births over deaths has been no less than 970—a number probably equal to those who have migrated from the District. The Statistical Tables which I have prepared for the information of the Board, afford a ready means of testing the general healthiness of the District, as compared with former years. It may nevertheless be desirable that I should indicate a few points of interest tending to elucidate our real position, both as respects former years and the districts contiguous to our own. Of the 828 persons who died during the past year, 152 were upwards of 60 years of age, and of these 24 were more than 80. 220 were children under one year. In fact, considerably more than half the mortality of the District was due to persons under two years of age and above 60. So far as respects the aged, these figures are satisfactory, but it is a lamentable consideration that infants under one year old should represent more than a fourth of the total mortality. This unnatural state of things appears to be incidental to the crowded districts of all large towns. Boards of Health may 9 hope in some measure to lessen the evil, but the remedy lies principally with the natural guardians of the young; and when temperance, cleanliness, and a strict observance of home duties more extensively prevail, fewer of these little ones will prematurely pine sway and die. The Comparative Table also exhibits a result favorable to the healthiness of the Saint Saviour's District. You will perceive that the per centage of mortality for the whole of London is 2.452; in the South Districts, 2.337: while in Saint Saviour it is only 2.244. Of the deaths from Zymotic diseases there was, as compared with last year, an increase in Small Pox of 13, Scarlet Fever 17, and Typhus 5. There was a decrease in Measles of 18, Diphtheria 2, Hooping Cough 15, and Diarrhœa 9—making a total decrease of 11 deaths from epidemic diseases. If the mortality of Saint Saviour's District from these causes be compared with the whole of London and the Southern group, the same gratifying result appears. The deaths per thousand were 5.54 in London, 5.62 in the South, and only 4.89 in Saint Saviour's; while in some of the South Subdistricts the mortality reached 7.55 per thousand from epidemics. A result equally favorable is obtained by comparing the mortality from Fever alone. In London 7,907 deaths were registered; in the South Districts 1,959; and in Saint Saviour's District 81. These figures give for every thousand living persons, 2.84 deaths in London; 2.58 in the South Districts; and 2.22 in the Saint Saviour's district. The 106 deaths in the Workhouse is apparently an excessive proportion of the whole number; but it must not be forgotten that nearly all the inmates of that establishment are aged and infirm, and many are sent there that they may die surrounded by such comforts as their own homes could not afford. 57 of those who died were upwards of 60 years old, and of these 9 were more than 80 years. It is a satisfactory indication of the general healthiness of the Workhouse, that no fatal case of Zymotic disease occurred during the year. In the District there wore 21 deaths from violent or unnatural causes. Of the 26 registered in Guy's Hospital, 18 died from the effects of tire, in which number are included four children sent from the Parish of Saint Saviour. The births in the District were 305 in excess of the deaths. As the prospect of the opening year was somewhat clouded by the extensive prevalence of Small Pox, it should excite our gratitude that we have to record only 15 deaths from that cause. In my last Report I took the liberty of giving the inhabitants a few words of warning and advice. The Guardians of the Union also promptly and extensively issued notices calling their attention to the requirements of the compulsory Vaccination Act; and the abatement of that loathsome disease may, without presumption, be partly attributed to the vigorous measures adopted by public Boards and their Officers. 10 The malignant nature of the disease induced the public generally willingly to adopt those measures of precaution which were placed within their reach. I have already stated, that during the year 1863 the deaths from Fever registered in London amounted to 7,967. Of these 5,075 were due to Scarlet Fever, and 2,892 to Typhus. To these fatal results the Saint Saviour's District contributed a little short of its numerical proportion. There is no existing record of so large a mortality from this cause. In the year 1889 there were 2,500 deaths from Scarlet Fever; and it has been remarked, with reference to that period, that "it is probable, no epidemic of similar length and intensity ever before visited this Country.'' Last year, however, twice that number died from the same cause. The Typhus Fever of the past year was of a peculiarly malignant character. It almost uniformly happened that wherever it made its appearance, every member of the household was smitten down. In one house alone in this District, it raged for a period of three months, 23 persons—the entire number of the occupants of the house falling prostrate one after the other. Its exhausting and debilitating power spared neither the feeble nor the robust, the young nor the old. Indeed it appears to have been most fatal to those apparently most able to resist its power. More than one instance occurred in your District, in which the head of the family, after having seen wife and children prostrated by this poison and recovering from its effects, at last received it himself, and sunk beneath its fatal power. There can be no doubt, however, that those persons who had been previously addicted to habits of intemperance proved the most difficult to cure. To such, a moderate amount of stimulant in the form of wine was almost useless as a remedial agent; while frequently in the case of children who had been unaccustomed to alcoholic drink, the beneficial effect of these remedies was almost instantaneous. You will observe from the Table of Sanitary Works, that your Inspector of Nuisances has displayed considerable activity during the past year. The Guardians of the Union and their Officers were, I believe, desirous of secluding cases of Fever whenever it was practicable, and liberally to relieve where it was not so. To these measures it is not unreasonable to attribute the low mortality of this District, as compared with those in the immediate neighbourhood, where some at least of these methods of alleviation were not adopted. Had it been possible to anticipate the epidemics of the past year, we should doubtless have predicated an aggregate increase of mortality. But happily the same benificent law of compensation, which so generally pervades human affairs, appears also to regulate health and disease, life and death. As the fatal effects of one form of disease increase it frequently happens that those of another kind diminish. Saint Saviour may now fairly be regarded as a healthy District. 11 If not equal to some suburban spots, it can still challenge comparison with London as a whole, or other Sub-districts in the immediate vicinity. Although such a state of things calls for gratitude, it equally forbids exultation. The mortality of London is still supposed to yield six unnatural deaths annually to every thousand living persons. It is, as it should be, the constant aim of this Board and its Officers to diminish, as far as possible, this waste of human life. But our powers are limited. Positive and injurious nuisances can be removed, but yet there will remain those causes of disease and death which can only be banished by individual effort. Personal and social reform can alone accomplish this object; and when the poorer classes especially arc led to recognize the importance of cleanliness, temperance, and habits of virtue and order, this great and permanent benefit will accrue to the commonwealth. During the period over which the present Report extends, two railroads have been opened in the District, and the whole length of Southwark Street made available for traffic. Other public and beneficial works are advancing in the neighbourhood, and we may confidently anticipate still further progress in social, domestic, and sanitary improvement. It only remains that I should direct your attention to the labors of your Inspector of Nuisances during the past year, which are summarised in an appended Table. The prevalence of Fever has necessitated corresponding effort on his part to diminish those nuisances which are supposed to generate and feed the disease. Included among those labors has been the inspection of 17 Slaughterhouses, 11 Cowhouses, and 18 Bakehouses in the District. In conclusion, I beg leave gratefully to acknowledge the cordial and harmonious co-operation of the Members of the Board and its Officers, in every effort to discharge those duties which your confidence has entrusted to me.
