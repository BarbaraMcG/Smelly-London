Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1951. During the year the health of the Borough remained good, and the incidence of infectious disease was low, except for measles, which was epidemic during the early part of the year. The Census of 1951 revealed a reduction in population of almost two thousand, as compared with the Census of 1931. The infant mortality rate, although showing a slight increase on last year's figures, is still less than the general rate for England and Wales. It is again pleasing to note a considerable reduction in the Tuberculosis death rate. In presenting this report I should like to thank the Council for their continued support and interest in matters relating to public health, and to pay tribute to all the members of the staff for their good work and co-operation. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ROSETTA HILL, July, 1952. Medical Officer of Health. 7 BOROUGH OF BARNES. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1951 PREFACE In accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 42/51 the Annual Report for 1951 has been prepared on the same lines as previous years, and consists of two parts—a preface in which reference is made to items of special interest, and an appendix in which is tabulated the statistics relating to the health of the district. The Registrar General is now supplying local authorities with "Comparability Factors" in respect of births and deaths, and you will see that these have been used in the compilation of the various statistics. I would explain that the use of the factors supplied by the Registrar General give corrected figures to the local rates, enabling truer comparisons to be made with the remainder of the country—i.e. as though the ages and sexes of the local population were in the same proportion as those for the whole country. STAFF Mr. H. W. Giles, who had qualified as a Sanitary Inspector earlier in the year, left the service of this department in September, to take up a position as Additional Sanitary Inspector with another Corporation. Mr. J. M. Read, who, also, had qualified as a Sanitary Inspector during this year, left this department in August, to take up duties as Additional Sanitary Inspector with another Council. Miss L. M. Fairclough was promoted to the position of Senior Clerk, which Mr. Giles had vacated, and Mrs. J. D. Wallis was appointed as Typist/Clerk in September, 1951, to take the position Miss Fairclough had vacated through her promotion. Mrs. Wallis had been a member of the Public Health Department for some years previously until she was transferred to the Surrey County Council, Northern Division, in July, 1948, under the National Health Service Act. Mr. J. M. Shearer was appointed as Junior General Division Clerk in September, 1951, to take the place of Mr. Read. Apart from the foregoing there have not been any changes in staff during this year. CENSUS 1951—ENGLAND AND WALES As a result of the Census taken, it will be noted that the total population for the Borough of Barnes is reduced by almost two thousand, the total population for the Census 1951 being 40,558 as against 42,440 for the Census of 1931. 8 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES Generally The incidence of infectious diseases in the Borough during the year was, generally, low, although measles was epidemic during the first half of the year. It is gratifying to note that although there were 541 cases of measles notified, no deaths occurred. Again, there were no cases of Diptheria notified. Poliomyelitis There were no cases of Poliomyelitis at all during 1951. Tuberculosis There was only a difference of one more case of Pulmonary Tuberculosis notified this year, compared with 1950. There were two new cases of Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis notified during the year, one of which was notified after death. The death rate for Pulmonary Tuberculosis was reduced by more than half, there having been only 8 deaths as compared with 19 in 1951, but there were two deaths in the non-pulmonary cases against none last year. MASS RADIOGRAPHY UNIT Arrangements were made for the Mass Radiography Unit of the South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board to visit the borough, from the 22nd January, 1951, to 2nd February, 1951, to afford free facilities for X-ray to residents of the Borough and staffs of business houses and commercial undertakings. Besides sessions for the general public, special sessions were held for school children, for staffs of business houses and large firms. Publicity was given through the media of posters, wide distribution of handbills, the local newspaper, and bv persons visiting. and by persons visiting. The attendance was very satisfactory, and the following is a summary of the results :— male female total Total number examined 1,393 1,629 3,022 male female Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Active 4 5 ,, ,, Inactive 54 48 (Previously known inactive cases: 14 male; 10 female, included in above) Tuberculous pleural effusion — 1 Abnormalities non-tuberculous 66 42 MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE There were again no maternal deaths during the year. 9 INFANT MORTALITY RATE There was a very slight increase in the number of deaths of infants under one year; there being 11 deaths in 1951 as compared with 10 in 1950. This figure is, however, still well below the average for the rest of the country. The Infant Mortality Rate for this area is thus 25.5 per 1,000, as compared with 29.6 for England and Wales. REMOVAL OF PERSONS IN NEED OF CARE AND ATTENTION (Section 47—National Assistance Act, 1948) During the year there were twenty-two cases of aged persons in need of care and attention reported, and each was visited by the District Sanitary Inspector. In no case was it found necessary to take action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. It will be appreciated that it is still very difficult to secure admission of old people to hospital, but after submitting reports of the home conditions, all of the really urgent cases were admitted within a reasonable time. Co-operation with the Regional Hospital Board and the County Welfare Department remains good. FOOD The conditions under which food is prepared and handled for the purpose of sale in the district have continued to engage a good proportion of the time of the Inspectors. Generally speaking a satisfactory standard has been maintained. There are, however, still a few premises where standards are very low and where all methods of persuasion and exhortation seem to meet with a poor response. The occupiers of these premises, however, carry out the minimum amount of cleaning and maintenance work, and so avoid legal proceedings being taken against them. Fortunately, it is pleasing to note that those premises which do maintain a high standard of hygiene appear to prosper commercially. Customers generally are being more particular in their requirements, but the prevailing economic conditions sometimes make inevitable purchases from the sub-standard type of premises, where, because of the rough conditions, overhead expenses are less and the product cheaper. The Food Byelaws have worked smoothly and well. The only real difficulty is to ensure that food exposed, in fishmongers' shops particularly, is kept protected from flies. Unsatisfactory features which were noted, and which have been the subject of representations to the appropriate quarters include:— Unsatisfactory storage, transport and handling of meat and bacon, the arrangements for collection of garbage and empty fish boxes from fishmongers, etc. 10 It is pleasing to report that the sale of ice-cream is now almost entirely confined to the wrapped article, and very few street vendors of loose ice-cream have been encountered. Unfortunately, however, there has been a tendency for all kinds of shops to be used for the sale of ice-cream. Some of these shops, although, in fact, complying with the requirements of the Food & Drugs Act, are not really very suitable for the sale of a commodity of this nature. However, all those registered agree to sell prepacked ice-cream only, so that the possibility of contamination is thereby considerably reduced. No ice-cream is being manufactured in the district. HOUSING The number of complaints of unsatisfactory housing Conditions has remained about the same as in 1950, but there has been a change in the type of complaint. Many sub-tenants lodge complaints, not with the intention of securing the execution of repairs or the provision of adequate facilities, but to strengthen their claim for rehousing by the Council's Housing Department. There is now practically no difficulty in getting essential repair work carried out, as far as labour and materials are concerned, but the high cost of repairs imposes considerable strain on the financial resources of some owners. However, less difficulty has been experienced in persuading owners to carry out repairs, and many more tenants are co-operating with owners in the carrying out of minor maintenance items, although it was necessary in eight cases for the Council to have repairs done where the owners had defaulted, the cost being recovered in accordance with the Housing and Public Health Acts, from the owners. There are still too many cases of overcrowding brought to our notice. Almost invariably these are families which have moved into the district in recent years, and whose claims for proper housing in this Borough do not merit a high degree of priority. Unfortunately, in these cases the young children are the ones most likely to be prejudiced in health, and environment. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DISTRICT More attention has been paid this year to matters of environmental hygiene. Several of the unsightly areas and buildings, which formerly formed ideal harbourages for rats, rubbish and objectionable matter of all kinds, have now been cleared and built on. Schemes are in hand for building on several other sites, particularly in the Mortlake High Street area. There has been a decline in the amount of pig and poultry keeping in the district, and we have received few complaints of this nature. The contnuance of the system of collection and storage of waste food presents a problem, where the interests of public health and 11 economic expediency clash. It is to be hoped that this method of hoarding waste food scraps on, or near, public footpaths and pavements, where the bins are subject to spillage and interference by large and small animals, including cats, dogs, horses and rats, will cease as soon as possible. The summer season proved to be quite a good one from the point of view of the prevalence of flies, midges and mosquitoes, and the measures taken in previous years to discourage the breeding of these pests, appear to have met with a large measure of success. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL The work on the remodelling of the sewage disposal works, managed by the Richmond Main Sewerage Board, was well advanced. Considering the difficulties which are presented when new constructional work involves considerable disturbance of the existing plant, it is worthy of note that no complaints have been received by the Department during the year. WATER SUPPLY The water supply arrangements have remained unchanged, a good supply, both as regards quantity and quality, being maintained by the Metropolitan Water Board. Very few complaints were received, and in no case was this due to the main supply. The Board exercise close chemical and bacteriological analytical control and promptly deals with any matters referred to it. One sample of water, supplied to a post-war flat, was the subject of a routine check during enquiries into cases of alleged food poisoning. The water was found to be bacteriologically satisfactory.

The Borough Cleansing Station was not used during the year. The Council decided, on a report, that the demand for these facilities did not justify the maintenance of the Cleansing Station in a state fit for immediate use at any time, and the unit has been temporarily closed down. The apparatus and buildings are still in working order and could be re-opened, if necessary, at a few days' notice. Satisfactory arrangements have been made for any cases requiring treatment to be dealth with at the Medicinal Baths operated by the Kensington Borough Council, with payment by this Council on a per capita basis. One case was sent along for treatment under this arrangement, during the year. Disinfestation by spraying or fumigation was carried out in 20 houses or flats, including 5 Council-owned properties, by Corporation staff. 12 lots of bedding were destroyed, mainly as a result of deaths or infestation. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. Table 14.—Food Premises. The following inspections were made in respect of premises where food is prepared, handled and distributed:— Nature of inspection Number of premises Number of visits Notices issued and complied with Bakehouses 9 55 2 Cooked Meat Premises 63 73 Restaurants, Cafes and Dining Rooms 46 192 1 Public Houses 31 9 1 Fried Fish shops 4 18 - Butchers' shops 29 126 - Grocers' shops 79 268 1 Fishmongers 11 79 - Greengrocers 39 108 - Confectioners - 23 - Dairies 17 12 - Ice Cream Premises:— Manufacturers 2 9 - Retailers 72 90 - Other Food Premises or Visits 87 47 - Street Vendors 9 10 - School Kitchens 5 2 - Table 15.—Milk Sampling. (a) Chemical Analysis. 72 samples of milk were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis. These samples, with one exception, taken from milk roundsmen and local retailers, proved to be quite satisfactory. 28 Sample No. 242—Milk. The deficiency in milk solids, other than milk fat, in this sample, was brought to the attention of the distributors, and attributed by them to the seasonal decline in quality. There was no presumption as to added water and no further action was considered necessary. (b) Bacteriological Examination and Phosphatase Test. Taken from Total No. taken Results Satisfactory Not satisfactory Schools 14 12 2 Other sources 2 1 1 Phosphatase tests were also carried out by the Laboratory on all the above. Table 16.—Sampling of Other Foods and Drugs. (a) Chemical Analysis—Samples procured under the provisions of the Food & Drugs Act, 1938, included:— Foods. Apricots in Syrup Atom Sugar Com Barley Crystals Beef Sausages Butterkist Popcorn Chocolate Mousse Compton's Gravy Salt Crab Fish Paste Desiccated Coconut Fruitade Tablets Ground Almonds Herring Roes Lemonade Powder Lucky Dip Liquorice Macaroons Meat Rissoles Olive Oil Orange Mousse Parsley & Thyme Stuffing Peanut Butter Peppermints Pork Pie Drugs. Pork Sausages Raspberry Jam Rice Cremola Senior's Devilled Ham Thirst Quenchers Tomato Puree Tomato, Peeled Plum Veal, Ham & other Meat Paste Veal and Ham Pies Whisky White Pepper Serafig Laxative Syrup Medicated Peppermints The Public Analyst reported adversely on five of the samples and the following notes indicate the type of discrepancy and the action taken:— Samples Nos. 252 and 257—Pork Sausages. These two samples were obtained from the same source of supply and showed a deficiency in the meat content. In view of the amount of the discrepancy and the acknowledged difficulty in the mixing of ingredients, it was decided, by the Public Health Committee, that no further action be taken in these instances. Sample No. 266—Sausages. This was an informal sample of sausages handed in by a member of the public who apparently had not specified any particular type of sausage at the time of purchase. The question of labelling was taken up with the retailers and they undertook to indicate clearly the various types of sausage on sale in future. Sample No. 305—Orange Mousse. A complaint about the appearance of this product was investigated. The Public Analyst reported that the mousse was contaminated with specks of mould growth on the surface. The matter was taken up with the Manufacturers. The whole process of manufacture was checked, and it was finally concluded that dust from building operations in the vicinity was responsible. 29 Sample No. 275—Peanut Butter. Correspondence with the Importers of this product revealed that the stocks had been imported prior to the Labelling of Food Order 1950. No further supplies are being imported. (b) Bacteriological Analysis—Public Health Laboratory Service. (1) Ice-cream and Rinse Water. Eleven samples of Ice-cream and one sample of a Water Ice were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination. Of these, ten samples were placed in Grade I and two samples in Grade II, which is very satisfactory. In addition four samples of the Rinse Water in which ice-cream serving utensils are kept, were examined. Of these three were not as satisfactory as could be wished, and representations were made to the proprietors, with beneficial results. (2) Spirits. In addition to the above, samples of Whisky and Gin were informally tested for specific gravity by the District Inspectors. This method is quicker and cheaper than the normal form of sampling, and, of course, permits of additional Food and Drug samples being taken within the yearly quota. Doubtful samples are of course submitted to the Public Analyst for full examination. Table 17.—Unsound Food.
