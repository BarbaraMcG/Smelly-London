Multiple notifications.—In order to ascertain how far the statements so often made against the working of the notification of infectious diseases are justified by facts, the notifications received during 1897 have been carefully extracted and classified in the following table:— Notification Certificates, lst January to 31st December, 1897. 1. Total number of Certificates received 2336 2. Number of second certificates of same case received 141 (а) From a hospital colleague 1 (b) From a partner 1 (c) From an assistant 1 (d) From an independent source 138 3. Number of third certificates of same case received 1 4. Number of cases in which the same patient has, in addition, subsequently been separately certified as suffering from another dangerous infectious disease 10 5. Number of cases in which later symptoms have led to the patient being subsequently certified as not suffering from the dangerous infectious disease in the original certificate 34 (а) From the same practitioner 14 (b) From a different practitioner 20 VARIATIONS OF DIPHTHERIA PREVALENCE. In the Annual Report for 1894 it was shown that (1) in London, previous to 1891, the gradual rise in the mortality from Diphtheria corresponded with a gradual fall in the mortality from other throat diseases, namely, croup, laryngitis, other diseases of larynx and trachea, and sore throat and quinsy; (2) that, adding the deaths of all these diseases together, the death rate year by year from the throat diseases as a whole during the decennium 1881 to 1890 had not increased; but (3) that subsequent to 1890 the annual death-rate from the throat diseases as a whole was increasing. 23 It is now possible to view these changes in mortality to a later date, as set out in the tables below, for England and for London, and it will be observed that the variations in England are much less than in London, and have been influenced largely by London.

The next table (from the Registrar General's Annual Summary for 1897) shows the Sanitary Districts of which the Groups consist, and it will be observed that in the East Group the epidemic prevalence appears to have commenced in Bethnal Green District and to have spread from that centre. 26 It is a remarkable fact in reference to epidemic diphtheria, to which I first drew attention in my Annual Report for 1894, that whereas previous to 1891 the mortality from the disease fluctuated independently of scarlet fever, since 1891 the death-rates from the two diseases have fluctuated simultaneously in parallel lines, both reaching their maximum in 1893.

The mode of spread of Typhoid Fever. — We are slowly but surely tracing the manner in which enteric fever spreads. We know that the virus is eliminated from the human body in the fœces and the urine, and that the micro-organisms, the cause of the disease, will survive and multiply outside the body in favourable media to which they may gain access either directly or indirectly. The disease may thus spread— (1) By contamination of food and drink, such as water, milk, ices, oysters, mussels, whelks, &c., which are ingested. (2) By contamination of the earth, through leaky drains, unpaved yards, accumulations of filth, &c., giving rise to soil emanations, and— (3) By contamination of the person, or personal infection from a patient through failure to exercise scrupulous cleanliness and exclusiveness. 27 ISOLATION.

In enquiring into an outbreak of Typhoid Fever at the University College Hospital, attention was directed to the fact that some of the London Hospitals, which are not special Hospitals for the purpose of isolating and treating cases of infectious disease, nevertheless received such cases. The Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, omitting Small-pox (which it treated in a separate and distinct place from other infectious diseases), admit Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Typhoid and Typhus Fever. Of the last-named fever, very few cases occur in London, the first-named, primary Scarlet Fever, does not appear to be admitted to General Hospitals. With Diphtheria and Enteric Fever the matter is different, these two diseases are admitted at many of the Hospitals. In reference to Diphtheria there appears to be a consensus of opinion, that cases of this disease should not be admitted into the general wards of a general hospital, but that, if admitted, they should be treated in a special ward isolated from others, and that such provision may be made with advantage in general hospitals for moribund cases requiring tracheotomy. In reference to Typhoid Fever, on the contrary, there appears to be a considerable amount of leading opinion that cases of this disease should be treated in the general wards of a general hospital. No one has ventured to assert that it would be disadvantageous and undesirable to treat cases of this disease in a special ward in a general hospital, where all the special precautions necessary in nursing Typhoid Fever could be carried out without oversight or failure. But, it may be asserted that there is great risk in nursing typhoid cases in a general ward of a general hospital, risk to other patients and risk to the nurses. Risk to other patients, because scattered throughout medical literature will be found a number of instances in which patients have contracted Typhoid Fever in hospital. Risk to nurses, because in nursing general cases side by side with, and at the same time as, typhoid cases they are very apt to overlook the special precautions requisite for the latter, and a proportion of young adult nurses fall with the disease. If Typhoid Fever be allowed to be nursed in a general ward the most careful precautions must be taken, these precautions should be printed in the form of Regulations, of which a copy should be in the hands of every nurse, and a copy should be hung over the patient's bed. In these Regulations, not only should all the numerous necessary details of cleanliness be prescribed, but it should be made a sine qua non, that all vessels, linen, pans, pails, instruments, &c., used by the patient should be kept separate and distinct, and be specially coloured or marked. ISOLATION OF MEASLES BY EXCLUSION. Whilst it is not possible, on the score of expense, to isolate by the seclusion of cases of Measles in hospital, nevertheless it is possible by individual and family effort to isolate by the exclusion of infected children from school and school playgrounds, from other houses and places, and from other rooms than the infected room in the house. With this object in view notices are sent in every known case of Measles, and similar notices to all schools to the following effect:— 30 NOTICE AS TO MEASLES. For distribution to all responsible persons in infected premises. Saint Pancras, London.—Health Department. MEASLES. Measles is a highly infectious disease, and very liable to prove fatal unless proper care is taken of the patient. The first symptoms of the disease are those of a cold—shivering, couching, sneezing, redness of the eyes, and running of the nose—and it is infectious for several days before the rash appears. In view of the large number of children who die from Measles every year, parents are advised in all cases to seek medical advice. Measles is infectious for at least three weeks from the commencement of the illness, and the infection may be conveyed to others by those living in the house, or by their clothes, therefore particular attention is called to the following directions :— 1.—No healthy child from a house where measles exists should attend any school (including a Sunday school) for at least three weeks from the date of the appearance of the rash, and if a second or subsequent case of Measles occur, three weeks should be allowed to elapse before any child from the same house is permitted to attend school. 2.—It is dangerous for parents to visit or to receive visits from neighbours while their children are suffering from Measles, or to allow their children to play with other children in streets, yards, gardens, or elsewhere. 3.—A child or children suffering from Measles should on no account be allowed to roam about the house, but should be confined to one room, both with the object of preventing the spread of infection, and also the danger of exposure to draughts, which may cause fatal lung complications. 4.—Upon the complete recovery of a patient, not less than three weeks from the date of onset, the sick room or house should be thoroughly cleansed and aired, and the clothes of the patient washed, or cleansed and aired, according to the material. 5.—A child that has suffered from Measles should not be allowed to return to school until at least a week after complete recovery, so that the absence of the patient should last at least one month. N.B.—Notices similar to this will be sent to the Occupiers of any premises upon yvhich the Medical Officer of Health is informed that Measles prevails. John F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. ^3^ Please circulate this Notice amongst the other Occupiers of the house. DISINFECTION.

House-to-house Inspections.—The number of streets, or parts of streets, inspected from house to house during the year, was 8; consisting of 193 houses, 183 occupied, and 5 unoccupied, containing 1012 rooms, 1006 occupied, and 6 unoccupied; let to 457 families, consisting of 1103 adults and 671 children under 10 years of age. Upon these houses 108 notices were served. 58 Houses occupied in separate Dwellings.—These oonsist of (1) Houses specially constructed to be so occupied, and (2) houses not constructed to be so occupied. The former may be so constructed that the dwellings are (a) self contained, as those in List I. in the Appendix, or they may be so constructed that one or several of the appurtenances of the dwelling are used (b) partly in common. The latter are old houses originally constructed for occupation by one family, but let out to more than one family, and sometimes known as made-down houses. Registered Tenement Houses.—The number of houses let in separate dwellings, and registered under the Vestry's Bye-laws, was 152. Registered Common Lodging Houses. — The enforcement of the Bye-laws as to this class of premises is still in the hands of the London County Council. The number of registered common lodging houses in St. Pancras is 26, as set cut in List II. in the Appendix. There is no legal definition of a common lodging-house, but the following definition approaches nearly to a definition of such a house.—A house in which lodgings are let for profit by the night or for a longer period, to lodgers who are not members of the same family, and who occupy a sleeping-room or rooms in common, and pay separately for their accommodation to tho master of the house or of part of the house. Canal Boats.—Thirty-three canal boats used as dwellings, and moored in this district, were inspected and found in a satisfactory condition. Underground Rooms.—During the year in six cases underground rooms let separately from the rest of the house were discontinued as dwellings. In his recently published (1897) Weber-Parkes Prize Essay on Tuberculosis, Dr. Ransome of Manchester has described his experiments, which prove that light (daylight and sunlight) and air (moving air and windsl and dryness are fatal to the tubercle bacillus, and that darkness, stagnation, and dampness are favorable to its growth. He records experiments in which he readily succeeded in growing the bacillus on ordinary damp wall papers, and papers moistened with various condensed vapours, including the vapour of ground air from beneath basement rooms, and the vapour of human breath. These experiments demonstrate the special risk of injury to health run by those who occupy as dwellings underground rooms from which light and air are more or less excluded, the walls of which are more or less imperceptibly damp in the absence of a damp-proof course, the soil and subsoil of which admit ground-air and vapour in the absence of an impervious surface and of independent ventilation below the floor, and the interiors of which are occupied, especially at night, by human beings respiring and perspiring. Paving of Yards.—The necessity for preventing the pollution of the soil in the yards and areas of town houses by impervious surfaces has met recently with strong confirmation (1) from the observations of Sir Richard Thorne, K.C.B., F.R.S., in his address on "Soil and Circumstance in their Control of Pathogenic Organisms"; (2) from the laboratory experiments of Dr. Sydney Martin, described in the Medical Officers' Supplement to the Twenty-sixth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1896-97, in which he shows that the typhoid bacillus multiplies in the polluted soil of towns, and dies out iu the virgin soil of the country; and (3) from the practical outdoor experiments of Dr. John Robertson, M.O.H. of Sheffield, published in the "British Medical Journal" of January 8th, 1898, by which he 59 has shown that under natural outdoor conditions the typhoid organism is capable of growing very rapidly in polluted earth, and can apparently survive from one summer to another in such soil. Hence it is to be concluded that paved, levelled, and drained yards and watertight drains are essential where the residents desire to be secure against typhoid fever. Standards of Sanitation of Dwelling Premises.—In judging of the degrees of sanitation, it is necessary to distinguish between a nuisance actually injurious to health a nuisance dangerous to health, and a nuisance prejudicial to health, also other acts of commission and omission that may possibly be considered detrimental to health or comfort, and further also those improvements that may be made in structure, fitting, or arrangement, that contribute to comfort and convenience, and tand to protect and improve health. Thus for convenience sake it may be possible to adopt four standards of sanitation:— 1.—A nuisance standard in which actual danger or prejudice to health can be shown. 2.—A statutory standard in reference to many conditions specifically defined by statute, e.g., underground dwellings. 3.—A bye-law standard in reference to many structures and Acts detailed in bye-laws, e.g., paving of yards. 4.—A premium standard. This is the standard no doubt intended by the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, 1890, sec. 26, and for which exemption from inhabited house duty is offered as a premium. INSANITARY AREAS. Churchway Area.—The Loudon County Council is proceeding with the scheme under part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, referring to this area. Brantome Place and Prospect Terrace Improvement Schemes.—As stated in the previous Annual Report, your Vestry prepared two schemes under Part II of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, in reference to (1) the Prospect Terrace Area, in which 581 persons were to be displaced, at an estimated cost of £11,273, and on which 140 persons were to be re housed; and (2) the Brantome Place Area, on which 719 persons were to be displaced, at an estimated cost of £16,940, and on which 228 persons were to be re-housed. The two schemes making a total of 1,3C0 persons to be displaced, at an estimated cost of £28,214, and 428 persons to be rehoused on the Areas. Your Vestry then petitioned the Local Government Board for the issue of Orders sanctioning the two schemes. On the 10th and 16th March, 1897, the Local Government Board held an Inquiry into the Schemes. On the 25th June, the Local Government Board wrote, saying that the Board considered that, as the schemes do not provide for the re-housing of more than 428 60 persons out of 1,300 on the two areas, the Vestry should acquire land elsewhere for the purpose of constructing new dwellings to re-house at least 800 persons, and mentioning the following as possible sites:— 1.—A plot of land adjoining the Vestry Hall in Great College Street, which land belongs to the Vestry, and is now used as a stone yard, is estimated as being of sufficient extent for the erection of dwellings to accommodate 250 persons. 2.—A piece of land off Cromer Street, and now temporarily used as a stone yard in connection with the new Electric Railway, is mentioned as a site large enough fcr buildings to accommodate 150 persons. 3.—A portion of the spare land which forms part of the area known as "Cubitt's Yard," and on which area Rowton House has been recently erected. 4.—A small vacant plot situate alongside Purchese Street, and being close to Aldenham Street, which land is estimated to suffice as a site for the accommodation of 100 persons. 5.—Equity Buildings (one-storey cottages), with spare land behind, a site close to the New Midland Buildings, and regarded as of adequate extent to provide for the accommodation of 250 persons. 6.—A large vacant space at Early Mews, near the north end of Arlington Road, a site looked upon as suitable for the accommodation of 300 persons. 7.— A stone yard in Great College Street belonging to the Vestry, where there is supposed to be space for the accommodation of 100 persons. On the 9th September, 1897, was forwarded to the Local Government Board a Report approved by your Vestry on the 1st September, in which were pointed out the following objections to buildings being erected on the suggested sites, and the opinion expressed that your Vestry ought not to be required to re-house more than one-third of the population displaced. (1) The site adjoining the Vestry Hall is the property of the Vestry, and used as a stone yard. If it ceased to be so used the Vestry would have to acquire a site elsewhere, if this were possible, and would then, probably, have to demolish the houses standing on any such site, and displace a still larger number of persons. (2) The piece of land off Crorner Street is a site on the south side on which a number of houses have been demolished by some private individual, and a considerable number of persons of the same class have already been displaced. If the Vestry acquire vacant land for constructing Artizans' Dwellings, by purchasing it of a private individual after it has been cleared of dwellings occupied by the very class required to be re-housed, that would be altogether defeating the object of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. (3) The land referred to as forming part of Cubitt's Yard is not "spare land," but is occupied by large works, the trade interests of which would be far too valuable to be possible of acquirement at any reasonable cost. As the 61 Local Government Board mentions, there lias been recently erected close to this suggested site a large lodging house accommodating (600 or 700 persons. (4) A small plot of land alongside of Purchese Stroet and close to Aldenham Street is reported to have been already ear-marked by the Midland Railway Company, for the purpose of erecting dwelling houses of the class required in that neighbourhood, and there would also be the same objection to acquire this site of the Midland Railway Company as in the case of No. 2, as the Company demolished the dwellings already existing on that site and have not replaced them. (5) Equity Buildings have been much improved of late by the pressure brought to bear by the Vestry upon the owner, and a large amount of money having been spent upon them to render the buildings fit for occupation and habitable, it would be undesirable to demolish them. (6) The site adjoining Early Mews is over a mile north from the northern area, and nearly a mile and a half from the southern area, in addition to which it is entirely surrounded by houses, and therefore a very undesirable place upon which to erect Artizans' Dwellings. Objections were raised on behalf of the Vestry, on more than one occasion, to the Foundling Hospital allowing Artizans' Dwellings to be constructed on the Compton Place site, as totally unfit for the purpose, being entirely surrounded by houses. Early Mews is a similar site. (7) As regards the Stone Yard off Great College Street, which presumably refers to the Stone Yard on the bank of the Regent's Canal, north of the Refuse Destructor, it is nut a fit place for erecting Artizans' Dwellings, even if it were possible to obtain a stone yard elsewhere without pulling down existing dwellings occupied by the artizan class. With regard to the general aspect of the question, it was pointed out that the district in which the two insanitary areas are situated, viz., Ward 8, is one that is completely built upon, possessing not only no spare land for building, but being also sadly deficient in open space, more so than any other part of St. Paucras, and that the same applies to the districts immediately around this Ward. One of the reasons for demolishing the buildings on this site is because they are packed too closely together, and house too many persons on the areas, and the only manner in which it would be possible to re-house a larger number than proposed on the same site would be by reproducing in a greater or less degree the very conditions the Vestry is desirous of abolishing. As the district is covered with buildings, the only means by which additional land can be, provided is by the demolition of further buildings, a proceeding which would render it still more difficult to re-house the additional displaced population. The Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Part II., under which the schemes have been framed, provides, by Section 40, that "the Local Government Board shall in any Order sanctioning a scheme under this part of this Act require the insertion in the scheme of such provisions (if any) for the dwelling accommodation of persons of the working classes displaced by the scheme as seem to the Board required by the circumstances." The Act therefore contemplates the possibility of schemes in which no provision for re-housing will be made or required. 62 No doubt this was in the mind of the Home Secretary when he decided after the Inquiry held by his Commissioner, that the areas should be dealt with under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, rather than under Part I., on account of the difficulties of re-housing a large number of persons in such overbuilt districts. The Local Government Board, on the 18th October, wrote, saying that they were not satisfied that the sites named were unsuitable, and that the Board must require the Vestry to submit proposals for re-housing a greater number of persons than the number for which the schemes provided. On the 24th November, a Report was adopted by your Vestry, which was subsequently forwarded to the Local Government Board, pointing out that the requirements of the Board with regard to re-housing appeared burdensome. It was given in evidence before the Commissioner appointed by the Local Government Board, and appears on page 26 of the printed Minutes of Evidence, that there are on the Prospect Terrace Area more than three times and very nearly four times as many people as ought to be there, and similar evidence was given in the case of the Brantome Place Area. As a matter of fact these areas, to begin with, are densely crowded, and therefore the number, 1300, as the number to be displaced, must be regarded as an excessive number of persons on a given area, and yet so crowded as not to come within the technical definition of over-crowding for proceedings in a Police Court, but only possible to be dealt with under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. The amount of cubic space to be allowed for persons occupying the new buildings proposed will average probably double that occupied by persons now inhabiting the buildings. It follows that if the higher standard were now adopted and applied to the existing buildings it would mean turning out one-half of the population. This, however, cannot be so applied, as there is no legal machinery for applying such a standard to old buildings. It, therefore, follows that to put in force the Housing of the Working Classes Act, the Authority must practically provide double the amount of cubic space for the same population, or to put it in another form, must rehouse twice the population they displace. The Housing of the Working Classes Act in requiring rehousing never contemplated increasing the cubic space per head for the purpose of calculating the number to be rehoused. However, on sanitary grounds, it is desirable in considering schemes for rehousing, to estimate an increase of the general amount of cubic space per head occupied by the inhabitants of an old area. The question of the number rehousable is further complicated by the shape and situation of the Area, and the necessary disposition of new streets and buildings. It is quite clear from Section 4 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, under which Section these Areas were reported, that the object of the Act is to open out the buildings in order to expose them to more light and air. This cannot be done without sacrificing a certain amount of space, and space means housing accommodation. Another aspect of the question must be considered, and that is, that Central London is spreading ever outwards, and large numbers have been driven from Districts further South and East into these Areas, causing the numbers upon the Areas to be much greater than they should be. These persons have been displaced from other districts by the conversion of dwelling houses into work-places, workshops, and factories, and by Street improvements, and these Districts, and those who trade in them, have not been called upon to provide housing for those they have displaced. That duty is now cast upon your Authority. 63 It will be unnecessary to enter into a description of what takes place when new buildings are erected upon an Area, as it is well known that only a very small percentage of the persons displaced ever enter the new buildings, and of those that do enter still fewer remain long, as the class that inhabit Insanitary Areas are those that resent restraint most, and are the least inclined to adapt themselves to orderly and sanitary conditions. If, as suggested, new buildings are erected outside of Ward 8, and at some distance from the condemned Areas, it may safely be said that the percentage of persons displaced who will enter the new buildings will further decrease until it reaches a vanishing point, and may be disregarded. If, therefore, the object is merely to provide new buildings, whether the persons displaced from the Area enter them or not, it does not matter so much where the buildings are situated, and as St. Pancras contains more one and two-roomed dwellings than any other District in the Metropolis, and may be said to be one of the most crowded with houses, the causes and reasons are all present for erecting the buildings at some distance, access thereto being facilitated. But it will then be a question of whether public or private enterprise should provide such buildings. In carrying out the schemes one Area should be demolished and rebuilt upon before the other Area would be dealt with, this would reduce the immediate displacement and increase the facilities for rehousing. The only reasonable conclusion that can be come to with regard to rehousing after demolition is, that it should be made incumbent upon an Authority to utilize the space to the best advantage, and to the fullest extent permitted by the London Building Act, with regard to working-class houses. On the 4th December last, the Local Government Board replied, saying that the Vestry had misunderstood the Board, that they were not satisfied that the additional sites mentioned by them are unsuitable, and that they found nothing to lead them to modify their views, which were that they must require the Vestry to submit proposals for the rehousing of a greater number of persons than the number for which the present schemes provide. The question of the number to be rehoused should be settled first, as it is impossible to consider other points until this is fixed. Your Vestry have not asked that no accommodation should be provided, but have endeavoured to provide the maximum amount of accommodation under the circumstances of (a) diminished square space for construction due to the widening of thoroughfares, and (b) increased cubic space per head estimated for new dwellings, leading to the conclusion that under these improved conditions accommodation for a greater proportion of the number of persons displaced could not be provided for except by adopting a lower standard of cubic space per head. The schemes not only provide for the demolition of old houses and the creation of new, but also embrace street improvements, considerable allowance for which must be made in estimating; the square space available, and cubic dwelling space to be provided, for if the schemes were carried out as street improvements no rehousing would be required; but naturally every effort would be made to utilize the space to the best advantage, and to the fullest extent permitted bv the London Building Act provisions with regard to dwellings for the working class. 64 There is nothing to guarantee that the new buildings proposed to be erected on the areas, ostensibly for 428 persons,would not subsequently be occupied by a greater number of persons, and there is nothing in the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, requiring any additional cubic space per head to that occupied by the existing population. Although the Vestry would prefer the buildings proposed to be put on the areas to be occupied by only 42S persons they could be occupied by 800 persons without infringing the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, if they were somewhat increased in height and the dwelling space limited to the present amount per head. If new buildings are to bo erected to provide accommodation for nearly double the number of persons at present proposed to be provided for, it may possibly double the expense, and as the Loudon County Council will defray one-halt' of the cost of the schemes, the opinion of the Council upon this momentous question is important. A communication has been addressed to the Council, enclosing the necessary infoimation in reference to these schemes since the last inquiry. East of Chalton Street Area.—The Improvement Scheme originally adopted for this Area has been reconsidered, and a further improved scheme was adopted in its place on 11th May, 1898. SCHOOLS.

WORKSHOPS AND FACTORIES. Sanitary Conveniences.—Medical Officers of Health come into communication with H.M. Inspectors of Factories from time to time, and traverse part of the same ground, and it is therefore very desirable that there should be some distinct understanding as to the number of sanitary conveniences to be provided in factories, workshops and workplaces. For the purpose of framing such a standard other recognised standards may be of assistance. 68 It is provided in the Model Bye-laws of the Local Government Board with respect to houses let in lodgings to members of more than one family, that the landlord or owner of any such lodging-house shall provide and maintain in connection with such house, water-closet, earth-closet, or privy, accommodation in the proportion of not less than one water-closet, earth-closet, or privy, for every twelve persons, and the same provision is made in the Bye-laws of the London County Council, with reference to water-closets, earth-closets, and privies. In this case the standard of one w.c. for every twelve persons applies to dwelling-houses, places where persons may or may not work, but where they certainly live and sleep. In the Code of Regulations for Day Schools of the Education Department, the following are the standards adopted :— Number of W.C.'s required. Number of Children. For Girls. For Boys. For Infants. Under 30 Children - 2 1 2 „ 50 „ 3 2 3 „ 70 „ 4 2 3 „ 100 „ 5 3 4 „ 150 „ 6 3 5 „ 200 „ 7 4 6 „ 300 „ 8 5 7 Urinals in proportion. These figures work out proportionately as follows:— Number. Girls. Boys. Infants. Under 30 = 1 w.c. for every - 15 30 15 „ 50 = „ 162/3 25 162/3 „ 70 = „ 17¾ 35 231/3 „ 100 = „ 20 33 25 „ 150 = „ 25 50 30 „ 200 = „ 284/7 50 332/6 „ 300 = „ 374/8 60 426/7 Urinals in proportion These standards are unnecessarily numerous and complicated. It is quite possible to frame a more general and simple standard that should not be too low sanitarily, nor too high pecuniarily. It will be observed that if the number of scholars increases from 200 to 300, there is only one extra w.c. required for the additional 100 children. For years past in St. Pancras one water-closet for every twenty persons in workshops and factories has been regarded by the Officers of the Sanitary Authority as the standard provision, and in many other districts of the metropolis the same standard appears to have been adopted. 69 WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICE.

Combined Brains.—The question of combined drains laid without order, sanction' or approval, still remains unsettled. In the Annual Report for 1895 was quoted the Bill proposed by the Conference of London Sanitary Authorities to be introduced into Parliament, and supported by the London County Council, to amend the definition of "drain" and "sewer." Exception was taken to this Bill on the ground that it was inequitable to regard as drains combined drains constructed in places where no sewers existed, rather than as sewers. Consequently an amended Bill has been drafted by the Conference of Sanitary Authorities to provide for this objection, has been approved by your Vestry, and presented to the London County Council. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. Memorandum. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, under which the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis have to act, does not contain any definition of the word "drain," and the old definition in the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, is found to be defective and has led to conflicting decisions; this Bill, the result of a Conference of the Local Authorities, is to remedy the defect. A Bill to Amend the Metropolis Management Acts with respect to Sewers and Drains. Be it enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:— 71 1.—In the construction of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same, the word "drain" shall be deemed to apply to and include the subject matters specified in the interpretation of the word "drain" contained in the 250th Section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and in the 112th Section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, and also any drain the construction of which as a sewer has not been sanctioned by a Local Authority, or which has not been approved as a Sewer by the Metropolitan or other Commissioners of Sewers, or by the Metropolitan Board of Works, or the London County Council Provided that the London County Council may at any time hereafter approve as a sewer any drain for draining a group or block of houses, where, in the opinion of the Local Authority of the District, it is desirable that such drains should be cleansed, repaired, and maintained at the expense of such Local Authority, and such drain shall thereupon become a sewer, and be vested in such Local Authority. 2.—Any Local Authority may recover any expenses incurred by them after the passing of this Act in cleansing, repairing, or replacing any drain for draining any group or block of houses from the owner or owners of any premises for the drainage of which such drain is or may be used in such proportions, if there be more than one such owner, as may be determined by the Surveyor of the Local Authority, or in case of dispute by the London County Council. Any such expenses may be recovered from the present or any future owner of the premises, either by action in the High Court or before a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. 3.—The expression "Local Authority," as used in this Act, means any Yestry or District Board of Works under the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same, or in the Parish of Woolwich the Woolwich Local Board of Health. 4.—This Act may be cited as the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1896, and shall be construed as one with the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same. A most important point that is constantly overlooked, but must be persistently urged, is the fact that under the past and existing law, every time the land of premises has been sub-divided for sub letting or selling, or part of the buildings on premises have been separated for sub-letting or to change hands, the drains have become sewers, unless the private transaction has come within the knowledge of the Authority, and has been recorded, which is a rare event. The present state of the law is also no preventive, but a direct incentive to diverting an odd pipe or two and converting drains into sewers without the knowledge of Sanitary Authorities—in most cases an extremely simple operation readily performed, whether unwittingly or knowingly. In fact, the law at present rewards owners who escape the vigilance of Sanitary Authorities by relieving such owners of their responsibilities and casting the expense upon the ratepayers. 72 Separate W.C. Accommodation in Schools.—In the last Annual Report a case was quoted in which the Battersea Vestry was upheld iu refusing to sanction the construction of "trough" instead of "separate" W.C.'s in the Shillington Street Board School. Since then, in July, an appeal has been made against the disapproval of your Vestry to the construction of latrines at the St. Dominic's Girls' School in Southampton Road, and your Vestry also has been upheld by the London County Council in refusing sanction to the construction of such W.C.'s in schools. Leaky Drainage.—The remarks in the earlier part of this report upon the paving of yards, apply also to the rendering of drains watertight. Practical experiments prove the great danger caused by pollution of the soil, whether from leaky yards or from leaky drains, and under dwelling houses the danger must be greatly increased, although an unpaved yard may also be the means by which liquid pollution and washings may soak and percolate into and contaminate the soil under a house. In this sense, the imperviously paved and sloped surface of a yard may be regarded as part of the drainage system of a house. REFUSE REMOVAL. At the end of the first quarter of the year the system of dust collection that had been successfully working for the past five years was altered by your Vestry undertaking the collection in the East and West Divisions of the Parish without the intervention of a contractor, and the work of supervising these two Divisions is now carried on by another Committee, supervision of the North and South Divisions still remaining in the Health Department. Refusals.—With the object of endeavouring to ascertain what the average number of refusals is per week under a system of permissive weekly collection, the return sheets have been carefully extracted for four weeks in June, and four weeks in November, 1896, and the weekly mean struck for each period of the year in each of the Divisions and Sub-Divisions of the Parish. It will be noticed that at about every third house the removal of the dust is refused when the dustman makes his weekly call. 73 Divisions. Sub-Divisions. Wards. NUMBER OF HOUSES. REFUSALS.

This will apply especially to those thoroughfares to which the police regulation extends, which regulation requires the dust to be removed before 10 o'clock in the morning. Those thoroughfares are Gray's Inn Road, Euston Road, Tottenham Court Road, and Hampstead Road, and to them should be added Camden High Street. The London County Council Bye-law as to the daily removal of house refuse is as follows:—"Where a Sanitary Authority arrange for the daily removal of house refuse in their district or any part thereof, the occupier of any premises in such district or part thereof on which house refuse may from time to time accumulate shall at such hour of the day as the Sanitary Authority shall fix and notify by public announcement in their district, deposit on the kerbstone, or on the outer edge of the footway immediately in front of the house or in a conveniently accessible position on the premises, as the Sanitary Authority may prescribe by written notice served upon the occupier, a movable receptacle, in which shall be placed, for the purposes of removal by or on behalf of the Sanitary Authority, the house refuse which has accumulated on such premises since the preceding collection by such Authority. The Sanitary Authority shall collect such refuse, or cause the same to be collected, between such hours of the day as they have fixed and notified by public announcement in their district." Two points will no doubt arise when such a system is adopted for special thoroughfares or areas. One as to the kind of receptacles to be used, and the other as to the location of the receptacles. As to the kind of receptacles, the London County Council Bye-law provides that "when any person shall provide an ash pit in connection with a building, he shall cause the same to consist of one or more movable receptacles sufficient to contain the house refuse which may accumulate during any period not exceeding one week. Each such receptacle shall be constructed of metal and shall be provided with one or more suitable handles and cover. The capacity of each and such receptacle shall not exceed two cubic feet." It may be hoped, therefore, that the thoroughfares would not be disfigured by the appearances of old boxes, pails, tanks, scuttles, and such like contrivances in a dilapidated condition. As to the location of the receptacles, this would depend upon the construction of the houses. The fronts of houses may lay back with enclosed forecourts, or possess porticoes, or be flush with the street frontage line, with or without recessed entrances. The last condition is more commonly met with in the thoroughfares mentioned and the dust receptacles would then appear on the curb. But this, accompanied by daily morning removal, would be a lesser evil than the retention of reluse inside premises, many of which are entirely built over and possess no open space. REMOVAL OF MANURE. The Public Health Committee of the London County Council have from time to time received complaints of nuisance arising from accumulations of manure at various premises in London. Under Section 36 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, each Sanitary Authority is empowered to employ or contract with scavengers "for collecting and removing the manure and other refuse matter from "any stables and cow-houses within their district, the occupiers of which signify 75 "their consent in writing to such removal." The Committee of the Council are, however, advised that the Sanitary Authority has no power to charge for this service, and they are considering the question whether, with a view to facilitating the removal of manure, it is desirable to seek an amendment of this section, so as to give each Sanitary Authority posver to charge for the removal of manure, when required by the owner or occupier of any premises to remove it, similiar to that whioh it now has under Section 33 in respect of trade refuse, and have asked if the Vestry would be in favour of such proposed amendment of the law. The London County Council have been informed, in reply, that the Vestry of Saint Pancras is in favour of power being given to Sanitary Authorities to charge for the removal of manure, when required bv the owner or occupier of any premises to remove it under Section 36 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in & similar manner to that provided for trade refuse under Section 33 of the same Act. There is no difficulty in the removal of manure except about July and August, when market gardeners and farmers are too busy to fetch it and do not want it, contractors have their hands full and their vans and carts fully occupied, and railway companies avoid taking it, although by law they are required to, because their trucks and lines are already crowded. The manure then accumulates and gives rise to nuisances, which Sanitary Authorities attempt to abate by bringing pressure to bear upon the owners of the accumulated manure who are the occupiers of the premises. The occupiers find that, whereas during the rest of the year they could obtain removal of their manure either at a profit or without cost, or at least at trifling cost, during the months mentioned they cannot obtain the removal of their manure except at considerably increased cost; and under the pressure of Sanitary Authorities they turn round and endeavour to throw the onus upon these Authorities of removing their manure. It then becomes a question of weighing the advantages and disadvantages of removing manure by public bodies rather than by private individuals. The question of cost is the only one that makes a serious difference, and this resolves itself into a question of whether it is or is not desirable that the whole community should pay for the removal of the manure and other refuse of those who keep horses, donkeys, or cows for trade purposes, or for their private enjoyment. Sewage, domestic refuse, and road sweepings, the whole community help to produce more or less equally and they are collected and removed at public expense, but with regard to manure and trade refuse the whole community are not producers and those that are producers are not so to an equal extent. It is therefore more equitable that the removal of manure should be paid for by the owner and not by the community, and the charge should include not only the cost of the contractor, but also the cost of organising, supervision, and financing by the Sanitary Authority and its Officers. The question is a serious one because it includes the omnibus companies' stables, job masters' and livery stables, carrier companies' stables, railway companies' stables, and the mews and stables of many large firms and businesses. Now it happens that the nuisances are mainly caused by these large undertakings, and are due directly to the disturbance of large masses of manure and litter, which in the summer weather ferment in a few hours. If the masses of manure are not disturbed little nuisance is complained of, and it is my custom to advise the large Companies to make use of a movable receptacle on wheels, such as an old cart, for the purpose of storing and removing the manure without disturbance, and it has 76 proved an effective remedy. It would be a boon to London in the heat of summer if a Bye-law could be obtained to enforce this method of storage and removal from premises on which more than a certain quantity of manure and litter accumulates within twenty-four or forty-eight hours. NUISANCES. A large number of nuisances of various kinds were dealt with during the year and Table 11a in the Appendix shows the requirements demanded to abate them. Steam Whistles.—It may not be generally known that there is an Act, entitled "The Steam Whistles Act, 1872," in which it is provided as follows:— 2.— "No person shall use or employ in any manufactory, or any other place, any steam whistle or steam trumpet for the purpose of summoning or dismissing workmen or persons employed without the sanction of the Sanitary Authority; and every person offending against this section shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds, and to a further penalty not exceeding forty shillings for every day during which such offence continues. Provided always, that the sanitary authority, in case they have sanctioned the use of any such instrument as aforesaid, may at any time revoke such sanction on giving one month's notice to the person using the same. Provided also, that it shall be lawful for the Local Government Board, on representation made to them by any person that he is prejudicially affected by such sanction, to revoke the same, and such revocation shall have the same force and effect as if it had been made by the Sanitary Authority. 3.—"Sanitary Authority" means the authority at the time being empowered to execute the Nuisance Removal Acts, as defined and extended by the Sanitary Act, 1886. 4.—All offences and penalties under this Act may be prosecuted and recovered in England in manner directed by the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1848, and any Acts amending the same, and in Ireland.

The bakehouses were also inspected twice during the year, and the necessary cleansing enforced. From time to time fish-frying shops and marine stores have been inspected. The markets and market streets were kept under observation daily, and also on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. UNFIT FOOD.

Health Department, St. Pancras. 14th January, 1898. Dear Sir, Milk. The Health Committee of the Vestry of Saint Pancras, at its meeting held on Wednesday last, was informed that some Railway Companies prohibit Milk Churns from being locked. With a view to being supplied with correct information, I am requested by the Health Committee to ask you the following questions :— 1.—Does your Company prohibit Milk Churns being fastened in such a manner as to prevent anyone except the possessor of the key from opening them. 2.—If so, would you kindly inform me how the prohibition is enforced, and what are the reasons for so doing ? 3.—And further, if so, are any precautions adopted against the possibility of any persons tampering with the milk whilst upon your premises or in transit in your possession ? As this Authority carries out the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, I shall feel greatly obliged by your reply. I am, dear Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) Wm. Mallison. The Secretary. The Midland Railway Company replied on the 8th February, 1898, that the Company does not prohibit milk churns intended for conveyance over their railway being fastened in such a manner as to prevent anyone except the possessor of a key from opening them, and forwarded a print of the conditions of carriage of such traffic on their lines, the following being a copy— The Midland Railway Company undertake the carriage of milk by Passenger Train on the following terms :— Conditions of Carriage. 1.—Every can containing milk must be distinctly addressed, and the address label must be made of wood or metal. 2. —The lids of the milk cans must be properly fastened to the can. 3.—The cans must be legibly stamped with the name of the station from which they are sent when full. 4.—Each can (except hereafter provided for) must have the number of imperial gallons it is capable of containing marked upon it and the inside of each can must be marked to indicate the space occupied by eight gallons and by each additional gallon. In the case of " Sealed " cans, instead of the inside of the can being marked, each can must have its " tare " conspicuously stamped thereon outside. 83 5.—The Company will not undertake either the collection or delivery of the milk. 6 —The senders and consignees must assist in the loading and unloading of the cans when the milk is carried at the Reduced Rate. 7.—No milk cans capable of containing more than 17 imperial gallons of milk» except cans in use prior to 1st January, 1893, will be accepted for conveyance. 8.—The officials of the Company shall have the power to open any cans during transit and, if necessary, to detain the same for a reasonable time, in order to ascertain if the quantity of milk therein agrees with the quantity declared. 9.—Senders must in each case sign consignment notes, showing the actual quantity of milk to be forwarded, the name of consignee and the station to which it is to be sent. The Company reserve the right to refuse to accept milk, if and whenever the consignment note does not contain this information, or is not so signed. 10.—Two rates are in operation for the carriage of milk. One, the ordinary rate when the Company accept the ordinary liability of a Railway Company with the respect to the carriage of perishable merchandise by passenger train ; the other, a reduced rate adopted when the sender agrees to relieve the Company, and all other Companies or persons over whose line the traffic may pass, or in whose possession the fame may be during any portion of the transit, f rom all liability for loss, damage, mis-delivery, delay or detention, either with respect to the milk or the milk cans when full or empty, except upon proof that such loss, damage, mis-delivery, delay or detention arose from wilful misconduct on the part of the Company's Servants. 11.—The carriage of milk must be prepaid. The Great Northern Railway Company replied on the 21st January, 1893, that this Company does not prohibit milk cans being fastened in such a manner as to prevent anyone except the possessor of the key from opening them, and while not going into the question as to whether the churns are locked or otherwise, state that the lids are fastened with a pin and hasp, and that while the milk is on hand it ia left in someone's charge the whole time, and no one except the owner or his representative is allowed to interfere with it. In accordance with their Regulations the Company has power to open any churn during transit for the purpose of ascertaining whether the quantity of any milk therein agrees with the quantity declared. The London and North Western Railway Company replied on the 14th February, 1898, that their conditions for the conveyance of milk require that their officials shall have the power to open the churns, the object being that they should be in a position to test the amount of milk with that stated in the declaration made by the sender. As regards the question raised of precautions adopted against any tampering with the milk whilst upon their premises, the Company state that the bulk of the milk is conveyed in special vehicles where no one has access to it during transit, the odd lots being loaded in the Guards' Vans, where they remain under the eye of the 84 Guard, or in a locked-up van, until arrival at the receiving station, where the milk is met by the Consignees, and they have no reason to believe the milk is tampered with whilst on the premises. The Metropolitan Railway Company replied on the 18th January, 1898, explaining that the Company imposes no rule as to the form or method of fastening milk churns conveyed over this Railway, the Owner acting entirely in his discretion in the matter, and this answers question No. 1, on which Nos. 2 and 3 are dependent.

During the year the following Acts of sanitary interest to the Metropolis were added to the Statutes:— 60 & 61 Vict., Chap. 31. An Act to permit Local Authorities to provide cleansing and disinfection for persons infested with vermin. 60 & 61 Vict., Chap. 56. An Act to amend the law respecting the Metropolitan Water Companies. 60 & 61 Vict., Chap. 57. An Act to amend the law for the better protection of infant life. The Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, provides that any Local Authorities (Sanitary Authority and Board of Guardians), shall have the power, when in their discretion they shall see fit, to permit any person who shall apply to the said Authority, on the ground that he is infested with vermin, to ha\e the use, free of charge, of the apparatus (if any) which the Authority possess for cleansing the person and his clothing from vermin. The use of such apparatus shall not be considered to be parochial relief or charitable allowance to the person using the same, or to the parent of such person, and no such person or parent shall by reason thereof be deprived of any right or privilege or be subject to any disqualification or disability. Local Authorities may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances, and attendants that may be required for the carrying out of the Act. The Metropolis Water Act, 1897.—This Act makes the Railway and Canal Commission a Court to hear and decide upon complaints as to water supply. If the Vestry have cause to complain of the quality or quantity of the water supplied, the Commission will be the proper body to make complaints to. There is also a provision enabling a Local Authority to aid any water consumer in determining before the Court any question of importance as to the rights, duties, and liabilities of the Water Companies. The Infant Life Protection Act, 1897, is administered by the London County Council, and is for the purpose of detecting baby-farming. SPECIAL REPORTS.
