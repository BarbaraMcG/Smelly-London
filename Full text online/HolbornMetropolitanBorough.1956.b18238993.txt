Three of these were due to prematurity, including twins born at 24 weeks gestation, who survived for one hour. Two deaths were due to severe malformations and one to birth injury. Of the seven children dying between the age of one day and one year, five had congenital malformations, which caused or contributed to their death. One died following an operation to repair a congenitally malformed heart. One child died at three days of pulmonary atelectasis, and one at three months of asphyxia due to inhalation of vomit. In the case of four of the infants whose deaths were registered in Holborn, the home addresses were outside England and Wales. The premature twins were illegitimate and are solely responsible for the illegitimate infant mortality rate of 60.6.

The numbers of either males or females who have died of pulmonary tuberculosis have not shewn any uniform trend during these last ten years. The numbers of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung or bronchus are of interest in view of trends shewn by national figures. The Table does however show the higher incidence in men for both diseases, and that over the last five years these neoplasms have produced a wastage of life greater than that of pulmonary tuberculosis. 19 SECTION 3.

This work is carried out by the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, 23 Queen Square, W.C.1, and by the Public Health Laboratory Service at County Hall. During the year 87 specimens were submitted for examination with the following results:— Disease Positive Negative Total Diphtheria — 14 14 (Nasal and throat swabs) Dysentery (Faeces) 1 18 19 (Faecal swabs) 1 12 13 Food Poisoning (Faeces) 11 4 15 (Other specimens) — 3 3 Streptococcus haemolyticus 2 25 27 Vincents organisms 1 5 6 Other pathogenic organisms 2 5 7 Infectious Disease Contacts Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are paid only on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was not found necessary to issue any such certificates during the year. International Certificates of Vaccination against Cholera and Smallpox The International Sanitary Regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly on 25th May, 1951, prescribe inter alia that International Certificates, to be valid, must bear an approved stamp which certifies that the signature of the vaccinator is that of a doctor. During the year 558 certificates of persons travelling abroad were authenticated by the Department. Of these 456 were in respect of smallpox, 78 for cholera, 23 for typhoid, and 1 for yellow fever. Diphtheria Immunisation During the year 297 Holborn children completed immunisation against diphtheria. 24 25 TABLE No. 7 Comparative Figures of Infectious Disease for the last 30 years Disease 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 (Population) 42,209 39,280 38,380 38,380 34,470 36,440 36,050 36,000 35,400 34,850 34,600 34,350 30,660 23,470 17,160 16,580 17,240 18,020 18,680 21,190 23,460 24,960 25,490 25,930 24,540 23,950 23,710 23,340 23,060 22,640 Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup) 54 57 72 80 69 76 75 74 93 60 76 49 19 7 14 17 17 5 11 12 3 2 1 2 - - - - - - Dysentery — 2 2 _ 2 1 — 2 6 6 10 10 — — — — 2 13 2 6 — 4 — 2 34 9 8 34 4 7 Encephalitis Lethargica — — 1 1 — 1 1 1 1 — — — 2 — — — — — 1 — — — — — — — 1 — - - Enteric Fever 4 10 5 4 4 4 1 3 2 2 — — 1 1 3 1 6 1 — 1 1 1 — 1 — 2 1 2 Erysipelas 21 23 22 29 17 17 19 12 18 19 10 15 13 12 3 7 3 8 3 4 8 6 5 3 1 2 1 1 1 Food Poisoning Notifiable as from 12th July, 1932. 11 5 — — 3 5 2 - - - - - - 1 — 1 2 3 1 2 1 4 2 12 1 Malaria 1 1 1 — — 1 1 1 3 2 3 — 1 - - — 1 — — — — — — 1 1 — 1 1 Measles Notifiable as from 9th September, 19 38. — 8 39 34 58 219 33 103 107 157 87 170 137 254 133 195 37 172 71 Meningococcal Infection — 1 — — 4 1 3 1 1 2 1 1 3 7 7 1 1 — 1 2 2 — — — — — 2 1 2 2 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 9 10 6 5 7 4 6 6 4 3 3 5 4 4 1 5 4 4 1 4 3 3 3 2 - 2 3 1 Pneumonia (Acute primary & Acute-influenzal) 48 59 89 49 40 28 37 38 21 30 34 21 28 14 18 20 22 14 6 17 15 9 9 5 8 4 4 4 — 3 Polio-encephalitis Acute - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 - - - - - - - - - Poliomyelitis Acute - — — 1 1 2 - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 — 5 1 2 2 — 6 17 3 12 6 *Puerperal Fever 3 4 1 3 2 1 3 3 4 2 4 — — - 1 2 2 2 2 — 1 1 * * * * * * * * Puerperal Pyrexia 8 7 5 6 4 6 5 2 4 3 2 2 3 3 2 7 3 1 4 5 5 2 4 2 3 1 — — — — Scabies Notifiable as from 1st Au gust, 1 943. 54 99 125 106 43 16 4 3 4 3 6 1 5 5 Scarlet Fever 59 111 130 90 57 57 96 115 50 67 38 59 56 20 16 23 30 20 14 24 29 13 15 16 21 18 10 5 4 4 Smallpox — 1 43 14 3 1 1 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — - - Tuberculosis Pulmonary 91 91 76 76 80 73 50 83 68 77 66 71 64 44 47 45 51 41 59 55 47 39 42 39 45 46 48 32 40 33 Tu berculosis, Non-Pulmonary 20 14 12 10 8 16 9 6 5 13 10 8 5 3 6 8 3 9 9 5 4 8 6 5 2 3 4 4 3 Whooping Cough 82 104 153 33 44 108 23 65 99 76 60 53 71 7 42 48 38 30 11 43 23 74 5 90 33 32 62 6 1 22 400 495 618 401 342 408 335 412 379 365 322 296 278 161 194 242 456 280 364 392 348 268 269 311 406 261 366 133 258 157 * Ceased to be notifiable as from 30th July, 1948. 26 SECTION 4.

Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. One complaint was received regarding unsatisfactory drinking water. On investigation this was found to be due to a transient condition not affecting the purity of the water. Drainage During the year 3,882 inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 110 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 109 Combined Drainage Orders were made. Smoke Abatement During the year 41 complaints were received regarding smoke nuisances and 422 observations were made. In most cases, it was found that the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Public Health Inspectors. 30 Measurement of Deposited Matter and Sulphur Dioxide Since 1953 these forms of pollution have been recorded each month by means of apparatus installed on the roof of the British Museum. The apparatus consists of a deposit gauge for collecting rainwater and deposited matter, and a lead peroxide instrument for recording the amount of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The recordings obtained during 1956 were as follows:— Month Rainfall Monthly deposit—Tons per sq. mile Mg. of S03/day collected by 100 sq. cm. of Batch A Pb02 inches pH value Insoluble matter Soluble matter Total solids January 2.35 5.6 9.83 12.96 22.79 7.11 February 0.13 5.8 8.18 5.44 13.62 5.39 March 0.83 5.6 13.02 17.64 30.66 6.52 April 1.10 5.6 13.28 12.62 25.90 4.59 May 0.31 5.8 11.11 5.23 16.34 2.49 June 2.04 5.8 5.77 7.85 13.62 1.89 July 5.09 5.6 10.47 16.50 26.97 2.59 August 3.90 5.8 7.41 8.82 16.23 2.41 September 1.95 5.6 10.81 10.74 21.55 3.04 October 1.96 5.9 7.82 12.68 20.50 4.56 November 0.30 5.7 9.53 8.35 17.88 5.46 December 1.92 6.2 12.51 13.06 25.57 6.19 Total 21.88 - 119.74 131.89 251.63 52.24 Monthly Average 1.82 5.75 9.98 10.99 20.97 4.35 The solid matter expressed in tons falling over the area of Holborn month by month was as follows:— Month insoluble matter Soluble matter Total solids January 6.22 8.20 14.42 February 5.18 3.44 8.62 March 8.24 11.16 19.40 April 8.40 7.99 16.39 May 7.03 3.31 10.34 June 3.65 4.97 8.62 July 6.63 10.44 17.07 August 4.69 5.58 10.27 September 6.84 6.79 13.63 October 4.95 8.02 12.97 November 6.03 5.28 11.31 December 7.92 8.26 16.18 31 Daily Measurement of Suspended Matter During the latter part of 1955 apparatus for making daily estimations of smoke was installed by the Council at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, and at the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, Queen Square. The apparatus consists mainly of an air pump which draws a known volume of air from outside and passes it through a white filter paper. The amount of smoke collected is estimated by comparing the stain on the paper with a calibrated scale of shades.

During 1956 these observations were particularly useful in checking the behaviour of boiler plant installed in the numerous new buildings which have been erected within the Borough. Most of the new installations are oil fired however and very little trouble from smoke has been experienced. Nevertheless wherever it has been considered possible to reduce smoke, even though no offence has been committed, an investigation has been made and generally an improvement has been secured. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 This Act, the Poisons Rules, 1952/55, and the Poisons List Order, 1952/55, regulate the sale of poisons, and every local authority is required to keep a list of persons who are entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. During the year 1956, 34 applications were received for retention on this Council's list. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 This Act and the Regulations of 1951, require the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used in connection with certain upholstering and filling processes, and require premises used for the manufacture or storage of rag flock to be licensed. Five premises in the Borough are registered under the Act, but no premises are licensed for the manufacture or storage of rag flock. 32 Housing Acts, 1936-1954 The following is a summary of action under the above Acts during the year 1956. Slum Clearance Houses included in clearance areas Nil Houses included in clearance areas and demolished Nil Houses repaired as a result of action under Secs.9 and 10 Nil Houses made the subject of demolition orders Nil Houses demolished as a result of demolition orders Nil Houses made the subject of closing orders Nil Parts of buildings made the subject of closing orders Nil Parts of buildings closed by undertaking Nil Underground rooms made the subject of closing orders 2 Underground rooms closed by undertaking Nil Closing orders determined Nil No. of flats erected by the Council during the year Nil Note: The number of underground rooms which do not comply with the relevant Regulations, but which are occupied for human habitation, is 461. Houses Let in Lodgings Number in Borough 295 Inspections made 143 Overcrowding On the 1st January, 1956, 145 families were known to be living in overcrowded conditions. During the year a further 12 families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions. In 17 cases, overcrowding was abated during the year as follows:— Families rehoused by the Holborn Borough Council 1 Families rehoused by the London County Council 7 Accommodation found by other means 6 Size of family decreased by death or otherwise 3 During the year 50 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors in connection with conditions of overcrowding. In cases where overcrowding is abated, a warning letter is sent to the owner of the premises drawing attention to the relevant provisions of the Housing Act, 1936. 33 Rodent Control Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 This Act lays a duty upon a local authority to see that their district is kept free from rats and mice. It empowers them to carry out inspections and to require owners and occupiers to keep their land and premises free from infestation. Occupiers are required to give notification in writing of infestation by rats or mice to the local authority. Report for 12 months ended 31st March, 1957 The following particulars were supplied to the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food in accordance with Article 1 (c) of the Conditions of Exchequer Grants to Local Authorities dated 28th July, 1950:— Type of Property Local Authority Dwelling Houses Agricultural All other (including Business and Industrial) Total I.

In consequence, in 1956 the Council again undertook the work of rodent repression in sewers. Two treatments were carried out during the year using sausage rusk plus 2½% zinc phosphide, with the following results:— Treatment No. of Manholes No. of bodies found No. Date Baited Showing pre-bait take Total poison take 1 January, 1956 217 202 160 74 2 June, 1956 230 1 63 1 23 82 Disinfecting Station During 1956 the Council's new disinfecting station was completed on the site of the old one in the Council's Yard in Stukeley Street, and came into operation on the 3rd September. 35 One of the two original disinfecting machines has been modernised and is used for normal working. A new smaller machine has also been installed, and this is used with the larger one at peak periods or on its own with small loads for more economical working. The disinfecting machines are served by one of the two original steam boilers which has been made more efficient by conversion to oil firing with fully automatic control. During the year also, an agreement was entered into whereby Holborn undertook to carry out all disinfecting, disinfestation and cleansing work for the City of Westminster. This agreement necessitated an increase in the staff of the disinfecting station, and there was a transfer of certain personnel from Westminster to Holborn.

There were no cases arising during the year which called for action under the above Acts by the Public Health Department, but visits were made in connection with the voluntary removal of aged and infirm persons living alone, to hospitals or other places and in connection with the provision for such persons of home nursing and home help facilities. 36 Burial of the Dead Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died in the area, or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body are otherwise likely to be made. Such cases are those of persons who die in poor circumstances, and, with few exceptions, have no known relatives. Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have been asked by the Minister to exercise their powers to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of such persons dying in hospital. This Circular does not apply to voluntary hospitals, of which there are two in the Borough, namely the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Italian Hospital, Queen Square. During the year fourteen cases were dealt with, at a total cost of £202 7s. 6d. The total amount recovered during the year in respect of burials was £57 3s. 0d. The cases had come to the notice of the Public Health Department from the following sources:— Italian Hospital 2 Coroner's Officer 6 Friends or Relatives of Deceased 5 Undertakers 1 New Legislation Clean Air Act, 1956 The main objects of this Act are to prohibit the emission of dark smoke from chimneys, railway engines and vessels; to prohibit the installation of new industrial furnaces unless they are capable so far as practicable of being operated without emitting smoke; to require that the emission of grit from existing industrial furnaces shall be minimised and that new industrial furnaces burning pulverised fuel or large quantities of other solid fuel shall be provided with grit-arresting equipment; and to empower local authorities by order subject to confirmation by the Minister to declare "smoke control areas" in which the emission of smoke from chimneys will constitute an offence. Sanitary Inspectors (Change of Designation) Act, 1956 This Act provides that sanitary inspectors should henceforth be designated public health inspectors. Nature of Offence Legal Proceedings Action Taken Under Result Selling for human consumption a glass of hot milk to which an addition of at least 13.8% of water had been made. Section 32, Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Case dismissed. Council awarded £5 5s. 0d. costs. 37 SECTION 5. Factories. Most of the provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, are administered by the Ministry of Labour and National Service through H.M. Factory Inspectors. The Sanitary Authority is charged with the duty of enforcing the legislation as to sanitary accommodation in all factories in its area, and, in those factories where mechanical power is not used, legislation with regard to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, and drainage of floors. All factories must have an adequate supply of drinking water from a public main or some other source approved in writing by the Council. Particulars of inspections and other work carried out during 1956 are as follows:— Number of visits to:— Factories with mechanical power 115 Factories without mechanical power 15 Outworkers' rooms 12 Electrical stations and sites of building operations 224 Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948 The following particulars are furnished in accordance with Section 128 (3) of the principal Act, with respect to matters under Part I and Part VIII:— Part I of the Act 1.

Section 111 has the object of preventing such work being carried out in premises which are insanitary or in which infectious disease is present. The following table gives the number and type of such premises in the borough, and the nature of the work carried out:— Type of Specified Work Section 110 Section 111 No. of Outworkers in August List required by Sect. 110 (1) (c) No. of Cases of Default in Sending Lists to the Council No. of Prosecutions for Failure to Supply Lists No. of Instances of Work in Unwholesome Premises Notices served Prosecutions[/##] Wearing Apparel— Making, &c 211 - - - - - Cleaning and Washing 1 — — — — — Household Linen 1 — — — — — Lace, Lace Curtains and Nets - - Curtains and Furniture Hangings Furniture and Upholstery — — - — — Electro-plate — — — - — — File Making — — — - — — 39 Type of Specified Work Section 110 Section, 111 No. of Outworkers in August List required by Sect. 110(1)(c) No. of Cases of Default in Sending Lists to the Council No of Prosecutions for Failure to Supply Lists No. of Instances of work in Unwholesome Premises Notices served Prosecutions Brass and Brass Articles - - - - - - Fur Pulling — — — — — — Iron and Steel Cables and Chains Iron and Steel Anchors and Grapnels - — — Cart Gear — — — - — — Locks, Latches and Keys — — — - — — Umbrellas, &c — — — - — > — Artificial Flowers 1 — — - — — Nets, other than Wire Nets - — — Tents — — — - — — Sacks — — — - — — Racquet and Tennis Balls — — — - — — Paper Bags — — — - — — The making of Boxes or other Receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or partially of Paper - - - - - - Brush Making — — — - — — Pea Picking — — — - — — Feather Sorting — — — - — — Carding, &c., of Buttons, &c 4 - - — Stuffed Toys — — — - — — Basket Making — — — - — — Chocolates and Sweetmeats — — — - — — Cosaques, Christmas Crackers, Christmas Stockings, &c 64 - - - - - Textile Weaving — — — - — — Lampshades — — — - — — Total 282 — — — — — Firms in the Borough employing outworkers 24 No. of outworkers on lists submitted 282 No. of outworkers referred to other Boroughs 267 No. of outworkers in Holborn employed by Holborn firms 15 No. of outworkers in Holborn employed by firms outsidethe Borough 44 Total number of outworkers in Holborn 59 Inspection of outworkers' premises 12 Cases of notifiable disease occurring in such premises Nil 40 SECTION 6. Inspection and Supervision of Food. General All premises where food is prepared, stored or exposed for sale for human consumption are inspected, and the following is a record of the inspections made during 1956:— Dairies and milk shops 28 Ice cream, sale or storage 15 Restaurants and kitchens 1,027 Bakehouses 30 Butchers' shops 57 Fried fish shops 10 Other food shops 309 Market streets 54 Licensed premises 79 Re-inspections 53 Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Notices During 1956, 5 notices were served on owners or occupiers of food premises, drawing attention to infringements of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. Details of the premises are as follows:— Hotel kitchen 1 Licensed premises 2 Food shop 1 Food store 1 41 The following is a summary of the work carried out during the year as a result of Notices served under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, in respect of food premises: Walls, ceilings, floors, windows or doors of food room repaired 1 Walls, ceilings, floor, doors of food room cleansed 1 Registrations The Milk and Dairies Regulations require every Local Authority to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of distributor in their district and of all premises which are used as dairies. "Dairy" does not include a shop from which milk is supplied only in the properly closed and unopened vessels in which it is delivered to the shop, or other place in which milk is sold for consumption on the premises only. "Distributor" includes a purveyor of milk whether by wholesale or retail. Most distributors now sell milk in the bottles and cartons in which they receive it from the wholesaler, and consequently their premises are not required to be registered as dairies. Dairies registered during 1956 Nil Dairies on register at end of 1956 2 Distributors registered during 1956 7 Distributors removed from register during 1956 5 Distributors on register at end of 1956 68 Number of above distributors trading from premises outside Borough 29 Inspections made by Inspectors during 1956 28 Formal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 192 Informal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 3 During 1956, 192 formal and 3 informal samples of milk were taken. One sample was found to be adulterated, and legal proceedings were instituted(for details see page 36). 42 The following table shows the monthly variation of the chemical composition of the 195 samples.

Upon being satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with, a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area from which the designated milk is to be sold. Where a distributor holding a dealer's licence to use a special designation in respect of milk sold from premises in one area, wishes to sell milk within the area of another Licensing Authority, the latter authority may issue a dealer's supplementary licence authorising the use of the designation in their area. During the year 175 licences were issued, details of which are as follows:— Dealer's Dealer's Licences Supplementary Licences To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 24 26 To sell Pasteurised milk 40 26 To sell Sterilised milk 31 28 Milk—Bacteriological Examination During the year, 90 samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination. 25 of these were from milk supplied to schools in the Borough and four to a Day Nursery. 44 Registration of Premises used for the Manufacture, Storage or Sale of Ice Cream Premises used for the manufacture, storage or sale of ice cream are required by Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, to be registered by the local authority. On the 1st January, 1956, one set of premises was registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, in Holborn, and 106 premises were registered for storage and sale. During the year 13 applications were received and approved in respect of premises to be used for storage and sale. Three sets of premises ceased to be used for the storage and sale of ice cream, and were removed from the register. At the end of the year, there was one registration for manufacture, storage and sale, and 116 premises were registered for storage and sale. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, Etc.) Regulations, 1947 During the year, 72 samples of ice cream were submitted for examination by the Methylene Blue Test. The results in the grading suggested by the Ministry of Health were as follows:— Grade 1 63 Grade 2 4 Grade 3 3 Grade 4 2 In the case of samples falling within Grades 3 and 4, letters were sent to the vendors drawing their attention to the poor grading. In such cases where the ice cream was manufactured outside Holborn, details were also sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas concerned. Licensed Premises There are 74 public houses in the Borough, and during the year 79 inspections were carried out. In addition, 42 reports were submitted to the Licensing Justices, in respect of premises where application had been made for the grant, re-grant or transfer of a licence under the Licensing Act, 1953. 45 Food Sampling A total of 492 samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Borough Analyst for chemical analysis during the year. 339 were formal samples and 153 were informal.

While membership unfortunately dropped below the hundred mark to a total of ninety-seven, this was due mainly to cases where members had had to vacate premises owing to the expiration of lease. Nine new applications were received during the year, eight of which were approved for membership. There remained at the end of the year sixteen applications in respect of premises which have not yet been brought up to standard. A number of plastic "wash you hands" notices were purchased and a copy distributed to each member. Further copies were offered at a cost of ls. 3d. per notice; and orders were received for a further fifty-two notices. In October members were sent a large notice together with a poster suitable for display to the staff setting out the responsibilities placed upon food handlers by the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. These notices and posters together with a suitable letter inviting membership of the Guild were also circulated to all non-member food traders in the Borough. It had been hoped that a new Guild Brochure would have been in course of production by the end of the year, but there was some delay owing to the publishers having difficulty in selling the necessary advertising space. As a mark of appreciation of the great work which Alderman M. P. Greengross had done in the formation of the Guild and in promoting its progress the Guild elected him its first President. As in previous years, the Borough Council assisted the Guild by means of publicity in the form of posters relating to food hygiene. 50 SECTION 7. Tuberculosis.
