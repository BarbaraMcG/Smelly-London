Borough of Malden and Coombe ANNUAL REPORT of THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1954 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Malden. June, 1955. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Malden and Coombe. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1954 which has been prepared in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 28/54. The health of the district remains good and the vital statistics compare favourably with those of the country as a whole. Work on behalf of old people continues in close co-operation with the Maiden and Coombe Old People's Welfare Association. There has been a fall in the number of notified cases of whooping cough. The number of children who have been immunised against this disease has increased considerably during the past year and it does appear that the immunisation campaign is beginning to be effective. In conclusion I should like to thank the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee for their helpful cooperation and the staff of the department for the efficiency with which they have carried out their duties. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, J. B. MORWOOD, Medical Officer of Health. 2 STATISTICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

SCARLET FEVER. The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was sixteen, giving an incidence rate of 0.35 per thousand population, a much lower rate than in 1953. All the cases were very mild and no fatalities occurred. Six cases were treated at home and ten removed to Hospital. DIPHTHERIA. For the seventh year in succession the district was completely free from this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. Immunisation against diphtheria progresses smoothly. Special efforts are made to encourage mothers to bring their babies for immunisation in those cases where persuasion by the health visitor has failed. A note is made of every child aged seven months and older who has not been immunised and the parents of these babies are circularised in regard to the importance of immunisation against diphtheria. In many cases this personally addressed circular succeeds where other methods of encouragement have failed. Under the National Health Service Act all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area have been given an opportunity to provide services in the scheme. This has resulted in a number of children being immunised otherwise than at schools or clinics. The following statistics refer to immunisation carried out during the year:— Number of children immunised during the year (pre-school 555, school 61) 616 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 1089 Of the above, 190 were immunised and 102 given reinforcing doses by private practitioners. The fear of diphtheria has declined among parents in a direct relation to the decline of the disease itself; the majority of parents of young children nowadays have never seen or heard of a case of diphtheria among their neighbours' children and are more afraid of illnesses they know than of the dangers of diphtheria. It cannot be said too often "Diphtheria still kills". Elimination of this disease is conditional upon the maintenance of an adequate level of immunisation. In 1901, 10,000 persons died from diphtheria in England and Wales: In 1953 this number had been reduced to 23. Since 1944 (when records of corrected notifications were first kept) notifications have fallen from over 23,000 in that year to a new low figure of 182 for 1954. The following are figures for deaths and notifications (corrected) since 1944:— Year Deaths Corrected Notifications 1944 934 23,199 1945 722 18,596 1946 472 11,986 1947 244 5,609 1948 156 3,575 1949 84 1,890 1950 49 962 1951 33 664 1952 32 376 1953 23 266 1954 9* 182* * Provisional. From being one of the most serious causes of death of children in this country, diphtheria has now fallen to a position of numerical insignificance. It must not be allowed to revert. VACCINATIONS. Vaccination against smallpox is not now compulsory, the Vaccination Acts 1867 to 1907 having been repealed by the National Health Service Act, 1946. As with diphtheria immunisation, all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services for carrying out vaccinations. During the year the following were performed:— Vaccinations 386 Revaccinations 36 Total 422 9 Of the above, 197 individuals were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners. 325 of the persons vaccinated were under one year of age. ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS. One case of acute poliomyelitis (non-paralytic) was notified during the year. The patient made a good recovery. MEASLES. The number of cases of measles notified (76) was much lower than in 1953. One case was removed to hospital. No deaths occurred. WHOOPING COUGH. The number of cases of whooping cough notified was 85. One case was removed to hospital and no deaths occurred. The immunisation campaign against whooping cough which was commenced in the Borough in February, 1951 was intensified in 1953 and 1954. Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and mothers appreciate the facilities for immunisation which are available. Fortunately the whooping cough immunisation campaign has had a beneficial effect on the diphtheria immunisation campaign because the prophylactic material most commonly used gives combined protection against both whooping cough and diphtheria. It is to be hoped that whooping cough immunisation will prove as effective as immunisation against diphtheria. Details of the number of children immunised against whooping cough during the year are as follows:— Primary immunisations carried out by the medical officer of health 366 Primary immunisations carried out by private practitioners 185 Children receiving reinforcing doses by the medical officer of health 32 Children receiving reinforcing doses by private practitioners 34 10 SCABIES AND VERMINOUS CONDITIONS. Necessary action in reference to the conditions noted above has been very limited and calls for no special comment. FOOD POISONING OUTBREAKS. Total number of outbreaks Nil. There were three single cases of food poisoning which were due to salmonella typhi-murium. *CASES REMOVED TO ISOLATION HOSPITALS.

The death rate from tuberculosis per 1,000 of the population was 0.15 as compared with the rate for England and Wales of 0.18. Twenty-four cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were notified, twelve fewer than in 1953. PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS B.C.G. Vaccination of School Children. Following consideration of a recent Ministry of Health Memorandum on B.C.G. Vaccination the County Health and Education Committees have approved a scheme to offer B.C.G. Vaccination, subject to the necessary preliminary tests and to obtaining parental consent, free of charge to school children between their thirteenth and fourteenth birthdays. Skin tests and vaccinations would be done at the schools by Medical Officers of the School Health Service who had been specially designated for this purpose as required by the Minister. This vaccination was carried out towards the end of the year and the response was very good with no untoward reactions. It is hoped that this procedure will greatly reduce the incidence of Tuberculosis among young adults. 12 TUBERCULOSIS 1938- 1954.

ANNUAL REPORT of THE CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR 1954 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Malden. June, 1955. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my second annual report on the work carried out by your sanitary inspectors during the year. Recruitment of staff these days is a major difficulty and seriously interfered with the work of the Department. A vacancy for the post of Additional Sanitary Inspector was unfilled for three months and the post of General Assistant and Mortuary Attendant, which became vacant in September, was still unfilled at the end of the year. It is pleasing to report that it was not necessary during the year to resort to Court action to enforce notices under the Public Health or Housing Acts. 15 HOUSING.

The whole of the area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and the supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. In view of the large number of routine bacteriological and chemical examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any special local tests. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION The following numbers of rooms were disinfected for the undermentioned causes:— Whooping cough 1 Scarlet fever 2 Tuberculosis 9 Poliomyelitis (suspected) 3 Insect pests 19 Other 7 Four loads of bedding were removed for steam disinfection or destruction, and four bags of clothing were disinfected. Routine disinfection after scarlet fever is not now carried out and is only done in those instances where a special request is made. Instead a bottle of disinfectant is left and advice given as to the best method to be employed in dealing with the bedroom used by the patient. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1938.

Milk.— Two informal samples of milk were reported by the Public Analyst as containing added water. Formal samples subsequently obtained were satisfactory. The milk was processed outside this district and the local authority concerned was notified. Vitamin Tonic.— An informal sample was submitted to the Public Analyst. A mould growth had developed in the neck of the bottle due to prolonged storage. Stocks were withdrawn from sale and a warning letter was sent to the firm concerned. Ice Lollies.— An informal sample was submitted to the Public Analyst and was found to contain lead in excess of 0.2 parts per million. The dealers attention was called to this and the moulds in which the lollies were made were replaced by new ones. Subsequent samples were satisfactory. Pork Sausages.— The Public Analyst reported that two formal samples of pork sausages contained only 55% and 60% of meat respectively as against the generally accepted standard of 65% meat. A letter was sent to the manufacturers indicating that the Council considered that the meat (including fat) content of pork sausages should be a minimum of 65%. Further samples were satisfactory. Tinned Cream.— A labelling offence occurred in this instance in that notice of the addition of sugar to the cream was given on the label, but not so as to be conspicuously visible. The attention of the manufacturers was drawn to this and new labels were provided. Cough Mixture.— This was a labelling offence in that the syrup base used was a mixture of sugar and water and not sugar alone as was indicated on the label. The manufacturers attention was drawn to this and new labels were provided. MILK. During the year the following licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designations) (Raw Milk) or the (Special Designations) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949. Dealers Tuberculin tested 7 Pasteurised 7 Pasteuriser's 1 Sterilised 10 Supplementary. Tuberculin tested 9 Pasteurised 9 Sterilised 10 The difference between a dealer's and a supplementary licence is that, if a dairyman has premises in a local government area where he retails milk he is issued with a dealer's licence. Should he retail milk in another area he must obtain a supplementary licence from the Council of that area. 20 DETAILS OF MILK TESTING. CLASS OF MILK Number of Samples Tested Appropriate Tests Number of Samples Passed Failed Pasteurised 95 Phosphatase 94 1 Methylene Blue 93 2 Sterilised 7 Turbidity 7 — Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 35 Phosphatase Methylene Blue 35 35 Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) 3 Methylene Blue 3 — Biological 3 — The purpose of the phosphatase and methylene blue tests is to determine respectively whether or not the milk has been adequately heat treated and whether it is of good keeping quality. The turbidity test for sterilised milk is to determine whether or not the milk has been adequately sterilised. The greater importance must be attached to the phosphatase test as correct heat treatment or pasteurisation reasonably ensures that all pathogenic organisms have been eliminated. One failure occurred out of 130 examined. This test is highly sensitive and a failure will result if the milk has been heated to only 1½°F lower than the correct temperature of 145°F (holder process), or held for twenty minutes at 145°F instead of thirty minutes. The addition of as little as a quart of raw milk in 100 gallons of pasteurised milk will produce an adverse result. Failures may result from any one of these three factors and inspection of the plant is necessary to ascertain the cause. Two samples only failed to pass the methylene blue test. This occurred during the hot weather, when it is recognised that milk kept at an atmospheric shade temperature of above 65°F., even if efficiently pasteurised, will not remain sweet for any lengthy period. Farm bottled (tuberculin tested) milk is not pasteurised and is retailed without treatment. In order to ensure, as far as possible, that this does not contain any tubercle baccilli three samples were taken and submitted for biological examination (animal experiment). These all gave negative results. 21 FOOD SUPPLY. The following table lists the food premises in the district by type of business.

Lamb 5 lbs. Bacon 42 lbs. Dripping 120 lbs. Sausages 12 lbs. Corned beef and mutton 18 tins Luncheon meat 22 tins Stewed steak 6 tins Suet ½ lb. Cheese 121 lbs. Fish, wet 323 lbs. Fish 215 tins Oysters 37 jars Vegetables 271 tins Soup 93 tins Fruit 69 tins Biscuits 2 lbs. Milk, condensed, evaporated, etc. 36 tins Jams and marmalade 14 tins Frozen eggs 16 lbs. Eggs 4 doz. Sweets 5 lbs. Jelly 2 packets Lemonade powder 1,200 packets Chestnut spread 32 jars Coffee 13 tins Pickles 35 jars A number of complaints regarding foodstuffs was received during the year, some of which are worth recording :— (1) A complaint was received with respect to a foreign body in a packet of imported butter. On first examination it bore a superficial resemblance to the leg of a large insect, but microscopical examination proved it to be a long wood splinter apparently heavily stained with a dark dye. It was decided to send a warning letter to the firm concerned. (2) A complaint was received with respect to a chelsea bun which contained a large piece of wood. Proceedings were instituted in this case and the defendant was fined £7 with £2. 8s. 0d. costs. (3) A complaint was received with respect to foreign matter adhering to the inside of a bottle of milk. This consisted of brown specks and patches. Further examination showed it to consist of rusted particles of iron which appeared to have been scattered on the wet inside of the bottle and subsequent rusting of the iron had served to fix the iron particles firmly to the glass. It was decided not to institute proceedings and a warning letter was sent to the dairy concerned. (4) Two complaints were received with respect to loaves of sliced bread. A number of slices in each case were found to be contaminated with a mixture of flour, general dirt, finely divided iron, a small amount of vegetable oil or grease, and mineral oil, the flour being the major constituent. The presence of finely divided iron indicated part of the machinery as the source of contamination, the oil being derived from the lubricant. After giving careful consideration, it was decided not to institute proceedings but a warning letter was sent to the respective manufacturers. 23 (5) A complaint was received with respect to a piece of metal in a wrapped toffee. It was decided to institute proceedings in this case and the defendants were fined £2 with £2. 2s. Od. costs. (6) A complaint was received of foreign matter in a bottle of milk. This was found to consist of slimy fragments of a mould growth, the dark colour being due to a brown spore formation distinct from a matted lighter colour mycelium. Proceedings were instituted in this case and the defendants were fined £5 and £3. 3s. 0d. costs. (7) A complaint was received with respect to a bottle of T.T. milk containing foreign matter. This consisted of a large piece of orange yellow skin like material together with several fragments of a black object. This measured 1½ x 1¼. It was found on further examination to consist of a dense mould growth including numerous mould spores, the black objects attached being the remains of a large fly. Proceedings were instituted in this case and the defendants were fined £5 with £5. 5s. 0d. costs. ICE CREAM. Fifty-one samples were submitted to the methylene blue test and, of these thirty-nine were placed in grades I and II. Nine were placed in grade III and three in the low category of grade IV. The results can be said to be satisfactory. The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does serve as a simple and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in manufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certificate giving the results of testing has the following note appended:— "Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results of any single sample. Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade 1, 80 per cent into grades I or II, not more than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947. Year Total Samples Taken Grades I or II. % Grade III. % Grade IV. % 1947 29 13 44.8 13 44.8 3 10.4 1948 84 55 65.4 22 26.2 7 8.4 1949 63 54 85.7 8 12.7 1 1.6 1950 85 81 95.3 4 4.7 Nil. — 1951 79 74 93.7 5 6.3 Nil. — 1952 76 71 93.4 5 6.6 Nil. — 1953 46 43 93.5 1 2.2 2 4.3 1954 51 39 76.5 9 17.6 3 5.9 24 It should be noted that the twelve samples placed in grades III and IV were manufactured by firms outside this Borough. The Health Departments of the Councils concerned were notified and subsequent samples proved satisfactory. Ice-cream generally must now contain not less than 5% fat, 10% sugar and 1½% milk solids other than fat, although some variations in this standard are permitted where ice-cream contains fruit or, because of the Jewish dietary law, is sold as Parev (Kosher) Ice. A number of samples were taken during the year, details of which will be found in the table giving a list of food and drugs samples analysed (pages 17 and 18). MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT. By reason of the fact that the Council appoint an analyst for the purposes of the Food and Drugs Acts, 1938 and 1944, they may execute any of the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act other than those relating to importation, so far as relates to any foodstuff to which an Order in Council under the Act applies. These are administered by my department. Orders made under the Act require that on sale an indication of origin be given in the case of certain imported foods. A few cases were found where foreign apples or tomatoes were not labelled as such and verbal warnings were given. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are laid down with which they must comply. The Regulations made under this Act came into force on the 1st October, 1953, and one years grace was allowed until 1st October, 1954, for the sale of heating appliances manufactured before that date. Visits were made to all shops selling heating appliances and the provisions of the Act explained. In several instances appliances which did not comply with the standards were removed from sale. No formal action was taken during the year. RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. The duties of a local authority are to enforce this Act with a view to securing the use of clean filling materials. 25 One licence to store rag flock was issued for a wholesale store during the year. Two premises are registered for the purposes of the Act. These are premises where upholstery work is carried on. Two samples were taken during the year and submitted to the Analyst who reported that they were satisfactory. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act provides for a system of licensing and inspection of pet shops by local authorities. Two applications were received and after inspection and report, licences were granted. SHOPS ACT, 1950. During the year it was necessary to give warnings to a number of traders for offences in connection with Sunday trading. SMOKE ABATEMENT. During the year complaints were investigated with respect to several factory chimneys in the district. Although observations were kept, in no case was smoke emitted in such quantity as to be a nuisance. Improvements were brought about following discussions with the managers of the factories concerned. ERADICATION OF BED BUGS. During the year the following numbers of houses were found to be infested with bed bugs:— Infested Disinfested Council houses (rooms) — — Other houses (rooms) 13 13 RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The obligations of the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, have been fully met. The work of rats and mice destruction continues on a well organised basis, providing a free service to householders and making appropriate charges in the case of business premises. 26 The Council depots, sewage disposal works, refuse tip, piggeries and open spaces have received constant attention. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food require as one of their conditions of 'Grant' that an Authority's soil sewer system shall be subjected to an annual 10% test baiting and any infestation found subjected to initial and maintenance treatments. After consultation with the Ministry it was decided to waive the annual 10% test baiting of sewers for this year. This gave a saving of expenditure which, however, may result in some increase in cost for the year 1955. Constant liaison is maintained with officers of the infestation division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. I have always found them most helpful and co-operative, not only with practical advice but in the loaning of apparatus required for the occasional special problem. The Workable Area Committee meetings are held from time to time at which difficulties and new methods of rodent control are discussed. The damage done yearly to foodstuffs and the potential danger of the spread of disease renders the subject of great public health importance. HOUSING ACT, 1949 — IMPROVEMENT GRANTS. Following the additional publicity given to Improvement Grants both nationally and locally, numerous inquiries were received and much preliminary work carried out by way of detailed inspection and advice although ultimately the majority of these applicants decided not to proceed further with their applications. Unfortunately few inquiries were received from property owners other than owner-occupiers. Three applications were submitted to the Council, two of which were refused and one granted. MISCELLANEOUS. Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it was necessary during the year to arrange for two burials. As mentioned in previous reports the pit at Norbiton Potteries had become flooded and the water impregnated with chromates (as (CrO3). On the completion of the joint scheme of experimental wet tipping at Egham early in the year, the Council decided to complete the filling of this clay pit so that it could be used for an open space. 27 In view of its flooded condition and location in a central area the tipping method presented a problem. The pit contained approximately 3½ million gallons of water with a chromate content of 200 parts per million. The chromate concentration was such that it was not possible to pump out the water unless the chromate content could be reduced to below 10 parts per million because of its effect on the disposal works plant and the effluent produced. The offensive smell which arises from wet tipping is mainly due to the production of hydrogen sulphide. This results from the breakdown of sulphates by sulphate reducing bacteria. Discussions took place with officials of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research who had found that chromate has an inhibitory effect on the sulphate reducing organism desulphovibrio desulphuricans. Experiments carried out indicated that a nuisance was likely to occur if tipping took place into water containing chromate unless the supply of chromate could be replenished. Controlled tipping started on the 1st June, 1954, and by the end of the month the chromate content was considerably reduced. Ultimately it was found necessary to add further supplies of chromate waste weekly which prevented any nuisance arising. When the chromate content was down to a trace, the water was pumped out of the pit with the exception of a small amount of water which was kept inocuous by the use of chromate waste. By the end of the year normal dry tipping was being carried on. It is believed that this is the first time that the nuisance normally arising from wet tipping has been prevented by the use of chromate waste. Requests were received from a number of householders for assistance in the destruction of wasps nests. Eighty-nine wasps nests were destroyed. Some requests were declined where the nests were found to be in positions not causing real inconvenience. Many householders sought the advice of the Department about various animal, insect and mite infestations and were given advice and in some instances practical assistance. That the public appreciate this service is shewn by the many letters and messages received. By arrangement with the Surrey County Council the school kitchens and canteens (seven in number) were thoroughly sprayed 28 at the appropriate time with D.D.T. solution as a deterrent against insect infestation. Forty-four vacant council houses were inspected for evidence of insect infestation but none was found. Three licences were granted to station moveable dwellings in the area. Stoppages in public sewers (combined drains) were cleared by the department on three hundred and thirteen occasions. In a few instances the assistance of sewermen from the Borough Engineer's department had to be obtained. During the year ten applications were received for certificates of disrepair under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, and ten certificates were granted. Of the ten certificates granted, seven were revoked during the year. RAINFALL, 1954.
