To The Mayor Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Tottenham Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I submit herewith my Annual Report for the year 1964. which must be incomplete owing to necessity to publish it before 31 st March, 1965, after which time the Borough of Tottenham ceases to exist on merger with Hornsey and Wood Green into the Greater London Borough of Haringey (London Government Act, 1963). Omission of certain statistics and commentary arises from the fact that the Registrar Generals' figures for the year 1964 will not have been received. Also excluded this year is detailed reference to the personal and school health services, due to the time factor and pressure of work by all concerned in the transfer arrangements. As this will be my last Report before retirement I take the opportunity to thank members and staff of the Corporation for much encouragement and assistance given me during the nearly thirty years I have been privileged to work in Tottenham as Medical Officer of Health.

CONTROL OF DISEASE There were 957 notifications compared with 1214 in 1963. Of these 747 related to Measles which became prevalent towards the end of the year and continued into 1965. In general the year proved uneventful and brief notes are given on specific diseases. Tuberculosis The number of notifications of this disease continues to fall, the 1964 figure of 40 cases (35 respiratory and 5 other forms) being the lowest recorded for the Borough, and 25 per cent less than the previous lowest figure of 53 in 1962. Of the 35 respiratory cases 25 wore males, 17 being over 45 years of age. Only two of the 10 fenales came in this older age group. Scarlet Fever There were 59 cases of Scarlet Fever compared with the exceptionally l.w figure of 24. for 1963. The disease continued to be of the mild type experienced in recent years. Measles 747 cases were notified in 1 964 compared with 957 in 1963. Allowing for the normal biennial cycle a lower number of cases might have been anticipated but the epidemic period which started a little earlier towards the end of the year and continued into 1965 accounts for the higher incidence in the year under review. There were 31 cases of Whooping Cough notified in 1964 following the comparatively high number of cases, 92 in 1963. The value of early immunisation against this disease cannot be overemphasised as the illness is most distressing, particularly when it affects babies and young toddlers. This is used to describe any fevered condition which results in a temperature of 100.4°F or more occurring in a mother within 14 days of childbirth or miscarriage. 3 such cases were reported in 1964, one having fatal consequences. Scabies There were 30 .cases of Scabies during 1964 compared with 9 the previous year. This complaint is a parasitic skin infection which is usually communicated by direct person to person contact. The rising number of cases suggests there may be a lowering in the standards of morals and personal hygiene. Infectious Diseases of the Nervous System It is gratifying to be able to report that there were no cases of poliomyelitis, acute encephalitis or meningococcal infection during 1 964. Dysentery The 29 cases of sonne dysentery notified were scattered throughout the year, and no serious outbreak was recorded. The disease is generally of a mild nature, but maybe more serious when the very young or very old are affected 5. Enteric Fever No cases of typhoid or paratyphoid fever arose in 19 Food Poisoning There were 1+ notified cases of food poisoning in 1964, and one other case came to the notice of the department. The organisms were identified in four instances as follows:- s. st. paul, s. london, s. reading and cl.welchii. Diphtheria There was again no notification of this disease. There have been only 3 cases in the Borough during the past 10 years, the last case occurring in 1961.
