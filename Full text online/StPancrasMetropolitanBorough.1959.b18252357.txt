To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the health of the Borough of St. Pancras for 1959 It is with the deepest regret that I must commence by recording the death of Dr Dennis H Geffen, who had been Medical Officer of Health of the Borough of St. Pancras since 1944. Dr. Geffen was taken ill suddenly in his office in August 1959 and died five weeks later Most of this report is therefore a statement of the health of the Borough for the last year during which he was Medical Officer of Health of St. Pancras. In his first annual report to you Dr Geffen expressed his concern with both the need for adequate housing for the citizens of St Pancras and the care of its older inhabitants 1959 saw the completion of some of his work in this connection The last area of the 1955-1960 slum clearance programme was represented and the first overcrowding survey in St Pancras since 1937 was finished This survey is considered of sufficient importance to reproduce in full as an appendix to this report. The work of the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged continued to expand. A second meals van was purchased at the end of June 1959 which enabled 120 mid-day meals to be delivered daily to elderly residents who could not provide a meal for themselves This service was extended again early in 1960 when Mrs Geffen very graciously presented a third meals van to S P A. C. A in memory of her husband It is one of the services which helps many housebound elderly people to be cared for in their own homes where they wish to remain for as long as possible. The five health officers made 9 985 visits to persons over retirement age and were often able to help those they visited obtain domiciliary services which were needed Many older people do not know how to obtain these services,, have no younger relatives to help them and welcome the advice of the S, P A. C. A. nurses Outside the Borough of St. Pancras Dr. Geffen was well known for his interest in poliomyelitis andhis work on the relationship between injections and paralysis in this disease. Illness prevented him from reading a paper at an international conference on poliomyelitis at Munich in the Autumn of 1959 and I had the honour to present the paper for him. We both continued to follow carefully the progress of immunisation against this disease. In St. Pancras during the year 13,629 persons under the age of 26 were given two inoculations against poliomyelitis and 11,644 persons had a third inoculation. In spite of this there were 14 cases of poliomyelitis in the Borough during the year. Of these cases, eight were paralytic, so there should be no slackening in the campaign for immunisation against this disease. All persons up to the age of 40 may be inoculated and I especially urge persons who are travelling to countries outside Europe and North America to have at least two injections against poliomyelitis before commencing their journey. The steady decrease in the number of deaths from tuberculosis continues In 1949 the number of St. Pancras deaths from this disease was 105, but in 1959 there were only 13 deaths. I am glad to report that there was no significant increase in the number of deaths from cancer of the lung or from heart diseases. Statistics concerning other diseases will be found later in the report. 1959 was a sad year for the Public Health Department for, in addition to Dr. Geffen's death, Mr. Hague,, one of the Public Health Inspectors who had served in the Borough for nearly forty years, died in August 1959 and Mr. Williams, another Public Health Inspector with over 21 years' service, died in March 1960. Both these officers had suffered long illnesses and are greatly missed by their colleagues, In conclusion I would like to thank your Worship and the Aldermen and members of the Council for your help and interest throughout the year My thanks are due particularly to the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee. I also acknowledge the help and co-operation of all my colleagues in the various depart ments of the Council and the unfailing support and loyalty of the staff of the Public Health Department. I beg to remain, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, SUSAN M. TRACY, Medical Officer of Health METROPOLITAN BOROUGE OF ST.

These persons were reported by the Health Officers of the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged because they were refusing all offers of help and living under insanitary conditions. Satisfactory arrangements were made for three of these old people to be cared for and kept under observation in their own homes. They agreed to accept and were provided with various kinds of domiciliary help such as meals on wheels, laundry service and the services of a home help. Two of these persons are still at home; the third one remained at home for some months and then died in hospital after a short illness One person went to live with a relative pending admission to a home and three other persons who were too infirm to be cared for in their own homes agreed voluntarily to go into a home for old people. Unfortunately, in the four following cases it was necessary to invoke the provisions of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951:- Case No„ 253 - Miss F. aged 87 This elderly lady had been under observation for many years. She had been provided with the services of a home help, meals on wheels and a district nurse but in the end she refused to accept any domiciliary services As a result her own health and her home conditions deteriorated rapidly and it became necessary to use the provisions of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, to secure her compulsory removal.

Section 110 requires the occupier of every factory and every contractor employed by him to send to the Borough Council during the months of February and August in each year, lists showing the names and addresses of all outworkers employed by him outside the factory, and the places where they are employed. Failure to comply with this requirement renders the occupier liable to a fine not exceeding £10. The Council is required to forward the name and address of any outworker in this list whose address is not in St. Pancras to the local authority concerned. Section 111 applies to premises where work is carried on which, in the Council' s opinion, is injurious or dangerous to the health of the persons employed therein, and in such cases the Council is empowered to give notice of the circumstances, in writing, to the occupier of the factory. If, after the expiration of ten days, the occupier continues to give out work to those premises, he is guilty of an offence. A Schedule to the Act states that if the occupier of a factory knowingly allows a woman or girl to be employed therein within four weeks after she has given birth to a child, he shall be liable to a fine. If the occupier of a factory or his contractor allows wearing apparel to be made, cleaned or repaired in any place where an inmate is suffering from scarlet fever or smallpox, and cannot prove that he was unaware of the existance of the disease, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10. The Council has power to forbid work being given out to premises where an inmate is suffering from an infectious disease, and an occupier or contractor upon whom such an order has been served shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10 if he contravenes such order.

REPORT ON AN OVERCROWDING SURVEY OF THE BOROUGH On the 15th January, 1958, the Public Health Committee recommended that the Borough Council should proceed to carry out an overcrowding survey under the Housing Act, 1957 in Wards 2, 3 and 5 at an estimated cost of £1,000 The survey was duly completed and separate reports for each of these three wards were presented to the Committee at later meetings as follows:- Ward 2 - 4th June, 1958 Ward 5 - 9th July, 1958 Ward 3 - 17th September, 1958 A composite report of the three wards was presented to the Committee on the 22nd October, 1958, and the Committee at that meeting recommended to the Council that the survey should be extended to include the remainder of the Borough (Wards 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8) at an estimated cost of another £2,000. These five wards have now been surveyed and this report is for the whole of the Borough and incorporates, therefore the statistics obtained regarding Wards 2, 3 and 5 with those relevant to Wards 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8 Mode of operation - Temporary staff were engaged as enumerators to call at the houses for the purpose of ascertaining the number of members of every family, the number of children under ten years of age, and the number and position of the rooms occupied. Ward 2 was surveyed wholly by University students Ward 5 by students and certain other selected persons from the Employment Exchange, and Wards 1, 3, 4, 6. 7 and 8 wholly by approved applicants from the Employment Exchange Where the enumerators were refused information, visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to obtain the relevant data. The information secured has resulted in an up- to -date record being compiled and the incidence of overcrowding in the Borough assessed The decision as to whether or not a family was living in statutorily overcrowded conditions was not taken by the enumerators but was decided by the Public Health Inspectors who undertook the work of compiling the new Register. All cases of overcrowding were separately investigated by the Inspectors in order to obtain certain additional information. Scope of the survey - In order that the figures produced by the survey should be comparable with those of the 1935/37 survey, certain houses and flats have not been included in the statistics set out in the following pages. The dwellings so omitted number approximately 2,400 houses and flats, the majority of which are included in the addresses listed below Ward 1 - Holly Lodge Estate South Grove House, West Hill Court. Hylda Court, Fitzroy Park Brookfield Park. Ward 4 - Regency Court, Albany Court, St Mark's House, Arlington House. Ward 5 - White House, and the Nash Terraces facing Regent's Park. Ward 7 - Endsleigh Court, Gordon Mansions, Paramount Court, Tavistock Court, Warren Court. Ward 8 - Clare Court, Downing Court, Mount Pleasant House. 51 In addition, 190 unoccupied houses and flats were found during the survey of Wards, 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8. These also have been excluded from the survey. The table below sets out the numbers in each of the wards: - Houses Flats Total Ward 1 31 15 46 ,, 4 27 6 33 ,, 6 14 17 31 ,, 7 23 - 23 ,, 8 35 22 57 Totals 130 60 190 Finally, it was considered desirable to include certain streets in the survey of Ward 1, which were omitted from the original survey carried out in 1935/37. The inclusion of these streets accounts for the apparent increase of housing accommodation shown in Appendix Table 'A' . Definition of Overcrowding - Overcrowding occurs when the number of persons sleeping in the dwelling either:- (i) is such that any two persons of opposite sex, other than husband and wife, being over 10 years old must sleep in the same room, or (ii) is in excess of the permitted number of persons as defined in the Sixth Schedule of the Act, (Housing Act, 1957, section 77(1)), as follows:- Table 1 Permitted No. of persons Where a house consists of - (a) one room 2 (b) two rooms 3 (c) three rooms 5 (d) four rooms 754 (e) five rooms or more 10 with an additional 2 in respect of each room in excess of 5. Table 2 Permitted No. of persons Where the floor area of a room is - (a) 110 sq.ft. or more 2 (b) 90 ,, ,, ,, but less than 110 sq.ft. 1½ (C) 70 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 90 ,, 1 (d) 50 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 70 ,, 1½ (e) Under 50 sq.ft. Nil Note: A child under 10 years of age counts as one-half of a unit and a child under one year of age is not taken into account. 52 The expression 'permitted number of persons' means in relation to any dwelling house, either the number specified in Table 1 or Table 2, whichever is the less. Every rent book must contain a summary of the overcrowding provisions of the Housing Act, 1957, and a statement of the permitted number of persons in relation to the house (Housing Act, 1957, section 81(1)). To enable landlords to comply with the provisions, printed letters similar to the one attached to this report have been forwarded to them (Appendix F). REPORT ON THE OVERCROWDING SURVEY OP THE BOROUGH The Committee will be aware that the original overcrowding survey was carried out during the years 1935/37 A comparison between the situation then and now is as follows:- Table I 1935/37 1958/59 Total number of lettings 48,210 45,387 Not overcrowded 43,785 44,401 Overcrowded 4,425 986 Percentage overcrowded 9.18 2.17 The number of lettings has diminished by 2,823 The number of overcrowded families has diminished by 3,439 Percentage of overcrowded families has diminished by 7.01 Table II Total number of lettings where there was statutory overcrowding 986 Overcrowding by ½ unit 374 ,, ,, 1 ,, 272 ,, ,, 1½ ,, 80 ,, ,, 2 ,, 52 ,, ,, 2½ ,, 23 ,, ,, 3 ,, 8 ,, ,, 3½ ,, 3 ,, ,, 4 ,, 2 ,, ,, 4½ ,, 1 ,, ,, 5 ,, 2 Overcrowding due to two persons of opposite sex not being husband and wife having to occupy the same room 3 Number of cases of overcrowding abated since the survey commenced 166 The most serious cases of overcrowding discovered were as follows: - 53 Ward 1 (i) a family consisting of:husband and wife, three daughters, aged 21 years, 15 years, 16 years and three sons, aged 19 years, 18 years and 14 years, living in two rooms, measuring 128 and 96 sq.ft.

During this period 166 cases of overcrowding had been abated by the following means:- Number housed by either the London County Council or Borough Council 21 ,, ,, ,, the St. Pancras Housing Society 1 ,, moved elsewhere 111 ,, secured extra rooms 17 ,, where one or more members of family had gone to live elsewhere 14 ,, of families emigrated 1 ,, ,, ,, evicted 1 The majority of the 111 cases of overcrowding who had moved elsewhere were living in furnished rooms at the time the overcrowding was recorded.

Furnished and Unfurnished Lettings Of the 820 cases of overcrowding, (986 revealed by the survey less 16 6 abated during the survey), 407 are furnished lettings and 413 "unfurnished". Table V Analysis of Nationalities It has been suggested that overcrowding in the borough has resulted from the number of persons coming from abroad to reside In St. Pancras. Set out below is an analysis of the overcrowded families in each ward according to nationalities and this table has been compiled on the net number of 820 cases of overcrowding revealed by the survey, namely. 986 less 166 cases abated during the course of the survey:- Nationality Ward No Totals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 English 101 89 107 60 48 36 9 46 496 Irish 23 27 34 26 24 3 1 6 144 Chariot 11 11 15 8 20 5 7 - 77 African and West Indian 9 16 8 1 10 1 4 - 49 Hindoo and Pakistani 4 - 1 1 6 1 6 - 19 Italian 3 1 1 - 2 1 3 - 11 Maltese - ~ 2 - 2 1 - 1 6 Polish 2 1 - - - - - 1 4 French 2 - - 1 - - - - 3 Gibraltarian - - 1 - - - - 1 2 Hungarian 1 - - 1 - - - - 2 German - - - - - - - 1 1 Austrian - - 1 - - - - 1 Norwegian - - - - 1 - - - 1 Spanish - - - - - - - 1 1 Yugoslavian - - - - 1 - - - 1 Canadian 1 - - - - - - - 1 Danish 1 - - - - - - - 1 Totals 158 145 170 98 114 48 30 57 820 The number of different nationalities and the number of non British persons in each of these five wards is shown in the following table. The majority of these persons are of Cypriot, Irish, African, West Indian, Polish or Italian nationality and these are therefore shown separately. Nationality Ward No. Totals 1 4 6 7 8 No. of different nationalities 29 26 16 22 24 35 Cypriot 274 182 56 89 17 618 Irish 113 126 34 2 39 314 African 89 29 4 3 4 129 West Indian 185 40 12 41 8 286 Polish 48 32 7 6 11 104 Italian 31 25 27 58 65 206 Other Nationalities 81 64 26 142 60 373 Totals 821 498 166 341 204 2,030 Note: The 142 Other Nationalities in Ward 7 are mainly French (52); Chinese (36) and Hindoo (18). The above figures were not obtained by direct enquiry. The enumerators were instructed not to put a definite question as to nationality, but when given a foreign sounding name, to hazard a guess to the person they were interviewing and enter on their investigation report form any information they thereby elicited as to the nationality of persons in the house. In addition, it should be realised that only the head of a family has been included as a non-British person in compiling these figures The other members of the family are not included in the total number of other nationals given For these reasons the figures in the table must be regarded as an understatement of the actual position. Table VI Accommodation required to abate the overcrowding revealed by the survey In order to abate the overcrowding and to rehouse the families concerned on the basis of a sitting room for the family and a bedroom for each two individuals, separating sexes unless the couples are married or under ten years of age, the following accommodation would be required:- 58  Ward No. Totals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 One bedroom unit - 5 7 3 10 1 8 8 42 Two ,, ,, 64 68 65 39 53 16 9 11 325 Three ,, ,, 78 63 79 43 43 20 12 31 369 Pour ,, ,, 14 11 10 12 a 9 - 4 68 Five ,, ,, 2 2 9 1 1 - 1 2 18 Six ,, ,, - - 4 - - 2 - 1 7 Eight ,, ,, - - - 1 - - - - 1 Totals 158 149 179 99 115 48 30 57 830 6 Note 6 Nine units have been added to house married couples living with their parents. One has been added to house a married woman (separated from her husband) and her two children living with her parents Table VII Further reduction in number of cases of overcrowding As previously mentioned. Wards 2, 3 and 5 were the first wards dealt with They were surveyed during the first six months of 1958 The re visiting of the cases of overcrowding in these wards revealed that of the 524 cases of overcrowding discovered, 95 had been abated within about two months of the date of the survey Before the preparation of this final and composite report, it was considered it would be of interest to ascertain whether any additional cases of overcrowding had been abated in these three wards Accordingly. all the remaining cases, namely, 429, were re visited during September and October 1959, i.e just over fifteen months from the date of the actual survey It was found that a further 172 cases of overcrowding had been remedied in the following manner- Ward 2 Ward 3 Ward 5 Totals Number housed either by the London County Council or the Borough Council 13 12 9 34 Number who had moved elsewhere 40 31 28 99 ,, ,, ,, secured extra rooms 12 5 3 20 Number where one or more members of the family have gone to live elsewhere 5 7 4 16 Number who had emigrated - 2 1 3 Totals 70 57 45 172 The information secured at the revisiting of the cases of overcrowding is illuminating. It indicates there is a considerable movement of the population, that many overcrowded families do not "sit tight", but, independently of the local authority solve their own housing problems, and that the housing efforts of the Borough Council and the London County Council have had a marked effect in keeping overcrowding down to a low level. 59 Bathrooms and W.C. apartments The opportunity was taken during the survey to ascertain the number of houses without fixed baths and/or internal W.C. apartments. It was found that:- 4,057 houses or flats are without internal W.C's. (17 per cent.) 9,470 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, a bathroom (39.7 per cent.) Table VIII Cost of the Survey As already mentioned in the opening paragraphs of this report, the estimated cost of the necessary assistance to carry out the survey was £3,000, being made up of £1,000 estimate for Wards 2, 3 and 5 and £2,000 estimate for Wards 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8. The cost of the work, subject to some final adjustments, was as follows:- Wards 2,3,5 Wards 1,4,6,7,8 Totals £ s. d £ s. d £ s. d Outside survey 267 8. 0 427. 4. 3 694. 12. 3 Clerical work - Inspectors 551 13. 8 784. 8. 3 1,336. 1. 11 Clerks 105 13. 5 190. 7. 5 296. 0. 10 Post Clerk 10 8. 1 15. 6. 11 25. 15. 0 Extra clerical assistance 63 16. 3 155. 15. 0 219. 11. 3 Totals 998 19, 5 1,573. 1. 10 2,572. 1. 3 £ s. d Estimated cost 3,000 0 0 Actual cost as above 2,572 1 3 Balance £ 427. 18 9 The 1935/37 survey of the Borough cost £2,480 of which sum approximately half was borne by the London County Council. At that time the temporary enumerators were paid £3,10s. per week, the temporary clerks £3 per week and a comptometer operator £4 per week. The 1935/37 survey involved the measuring of rooms, whereas, with the 1958/59 survey, only those rooms not previously recorded had to be measured. Irrespective of this, the cost of the present survey compares favourable with the cost of the 1935/37 survey, and I consider that the survey has been justified. It indicates the trend of overcrowding in occupied house property in the borough and shows some of the causes. All house property owners in the Borough have now been informed of the "permitted numbers" of persons relevant to each of the lettings they control, and some overcrowding has been abated because of the survey Statistical summaries and other documents are attached to this Report as follows:- Appendix 'A' Statistical summary comparing the 1935/37 survey with the 1958/59 survey. ,, 'B' Table indicating the degree of overcrowding in each Ward. ,, 'C' Statistical summary indicating the average number of persons per room and per letting etc. 60 61 APPENDIX °A' 1935/37 1958/59 Ward Number Totals Ward Number Totals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Total number of lettings 8,724 4,945 9,556 6,235 6,900 3,928 1,955 5,967 48,210 10,431 4,684 8,995 5,826 5,737 3,238 1,667 4,809 45,387 Not overcrowded 8,220 4,396 8,893 5,685 6,231 3,301 1,715 5,344 43,785 10,254 4,501 8,793 5, 702 5,598 3,177 1,632 4,744 44,401 Overcrowded 504 549 663 550 669 627 240 623 4,425 177 183 202 124 139 61 35 65 986 Percentages overcrowded 5.79 11.10 6.94 8.82 9.70 16.00 12.28 10.44 9.18 1.69 3.91 2.24 2.12 2.42 1.88 2.09 1.35 2.17 Ward Number Totals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 The Number of lettings has increased by 1, 707 - - - - - - - 2,823(net ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, decreased ,, - 261 561 409 1,163 690 289 11158 decreased) ,, ,, ,, overcrowded families has diminished by 327 366 461 426 530 566 205 558 3,439 Percentage of overcrowded families has diminished by 4.10 7.19 4.70 6.69 7.28 14.12 10.19 7.83 7.01 Note.
