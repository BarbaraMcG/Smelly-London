The introduction of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.,) Regulations called for a large amount of supervision of Ice Cream Vendors and Manufacturers. Groat improvements were carried out as regards machinery, which is now mainly of the modern dairy type. Many samples were taken and the results obtained were used to track various faults. The actual product is now for more in the nature of a dairy product despite the varying constituents. The Ministry of Food has not been able to specify a standard, either of purity or food value , thereby leaving much to be done by way of education and persuasion. HOUSING. During the year 8 premises were represented as being unfit for human habitation. The Municipal Year of 1947 towards it close saw the completion of the Council's temporary housing programme, the last Emergency Factory made house having been handed over for occupation on the 7th October, 1947. The completed programme of temporary accommodation is:- C.A. Hutments 265. E.F.M. Houses 321 Total 506 The conversion of No.52 wickham Road was completed, a11 four flats being occupied by the 20th September, 1947, The rebuilding of the seven houses on the Brockley Housing Estate which were destroyed by Enemy Action proceeded, four of these being completed and occupied, and the remaining three completed very shortly after. In spite of great difficulties common to all authorities, and which tend to increase rather than diminish as time passes, very considerable progress was made with the first section of the Council's Permanent Housing Programme. The first bricks were laid in November 1946 but the early part of 1947 produced such bad weather that for some eight weeks building work was practically at a standstill, and this, together with shortage of labour and materials, severely handicapped all the efforts of the Council to. speed up the work and keep to its original schedule. Further, on the Milton Court Road site the lengthy procedure under the Highway Act 1835, for the closing and diversion of roadways impeded the speedy development of this site, but the subsequent progress here has been heartening when all difficulties are considered. Nevertheless the new houses have been handed over at intervals, and there is no question but that these are dwellings of which the Council can be justifiably proud; moreover, the tenants already installed are most enthusiastic in their praise not only of the exterior design but of the internal plan and fittings. In detail the position regarding these houses at the end of the period under report was:- 9 KNOYLE STREET SITE. (24 houses). All 16 houses abutting upon Knoyle Street were completed and occupied. The remaining eight houses in Chubworthy Strect were roofed in, of which two were completed except for pointing, three were plastered,and in the remaining three, the installation of internal fittings was commence. MILTON COURT ROAD SITE. (58 houses. ). Eight houses were roofed in, of which six were ready for plastering. Four houses were completed to eaves level. Twenty-eight houses - Brickwork at average 4'6" above damp-proof course. Four houses - at damp-proof course level. All new water mains laid. 75% new gas mains laid. 75% new electric mains 1aid. • ARICA ROAD SITE, (48 Flats in two blocks of 3 storeys). One block of twenty-four dwellings was structurally complete and finishing work was proceeding as follows:- Glazing 100% Asphalting to roof 100% Plastering 55% Flooring 55% External Painting 75% Pram Sheds 50% On the second block of twenty-four dwellings, brickwork was completed generally to first, floor level, with suspended floor laid, and proceeding up to 33% of second floor level. CLYDE STREET SITE. (100 Flats in 3 blocks of 5 storeys). Sycamore House, Edward Street. (40 Flats). Brickwork up to third floor completed, and shuttering for suspended floor commenced. Larch House, Clyde Street, (30 Flats). Brickwork to second floor proceeding. Beech House. Clyde Street. (50 Flats). Ground Floor brickwork completed and shuttering for suspended floor complete ready for concrete. During the Municipal Year 1947, the following families were accommodated:- » • In temporary houses 129 In permanent houses and flats 26 In requisitioned premises 552 Total 707 10 With regard to the Second Stage of the Council's Housing Programme, which was authorised by the Ministry of Hea1th for commencement during the first six months of 1948, the following developments were approved by the London County Council and tenders invited Shardeloes Road Site 31 flats in 3 and 4 storeys. Roke by Road Site 17 flats in 3 and 4 storeys. Erlanger Road Site 30 flats in 3 storeys. Idonia Street Site 60 flats in 5 storeys. Total 138 flats. The Ministry of Health also authorised the development of certain sites, which will provide approximately 10 shops and 100 dwellings during the latter six months of 1948. Preliminary steps were put in hand for the formation of the fourth stage for the first half of 1949, and the development of certain sites in this connection approved by the Ministry of Health. RODENT CONTROL. A Block system, in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Food, continued to operate throughout the year under report, two Investigators and four Operators working under the general supervision of the Sanitary Inspectors. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. Milk Others Total Samples taken 137 260 397 Number of adulterated or otherwise infringing the Act by reason of improper labelling or other irregularity 8 16 24 Instances in which proceedings were instituted. - 1 1 In addition to the analyses under the Food and Drugs Act, as specified above, eight samples were examined under the Pharmacy and Medicines Act. In five instances irregularities in respect of labelling were detected details of which were reported to the Pharmaceutical Association. Fifty samples were examined under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations and in twelve instances irregularities in labelling were detected which following upon correspondence with the wholesalers, were put in order. Twenty-three samples of graded milk were examined and in two instances the samples failed to comply with the Methylene Blue test. The attention of the firms concerned was drawn to this and subsequent samples proved in order. The public Analyst also examined one sample of Disinfectant Powder and drew up a draft specificati on to safeguard the. Counc ll' s interests in future contracts for such powder. 11 THE FACTORIES ACT, 1957.
