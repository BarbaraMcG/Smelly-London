PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE His Worship the Mayor (Councillor R. S. Marriott, J.P.) Chairman: Councillor W. Taylor, J.P. Alderman Mrs. G. E. Green „ E. Murphy, L.C.C. „ T. F. M. Shepherd Councillor S. H. Banks „ Mrs. M. J. Chrisp Mrs. F. K. Dolby „ Miss E. E. Greenaway „ A. G. Keyse „ Mrs. D. Nason „ Mrs. A. M. Ott. Public Health Department, Deptford Town Hall, S.E.14. August, 1955. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting this account of the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for 1954. The population continues to decline and the Birth-Rate is the lowest since 1938. On the other hand the Infantile Mortality Rate at 16.5 is the lowest ever recorded in the Borough and must afford satisfaction. The figure is well below the average for London and the Country as a whole. The death rate of 12.0 is above the average for London, but this figure would be much improved if our statistics were not weighted with the deaths of old people admitted to New Cross General Hospital. Total notifications of Infectious Diseases showed considerable decline due mainly to the lower incidence of Measles and Dysentery. Primary cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis increased from 147 to 156, but there were five fewer deaths. Despite great advances in the treatment of this disease, as evidenced by fewer deaths, and excellent follow-up and contact tracing, the progress being made in eradicating Pulmonary Tuberculosis from the community is disappointing. It would appear that greater emphasis will have to be placed on immunology as opposed to sociology. As in all Infectious Diseases, sociological factors are important but individual resistance or immunity to tuberculosis may be even more vital from the epidemiological aspect. How often we find individuals living in perhaps better conditions and not as frequently exposed to infection, contract the disease and succumb quickly. It is therefore the duty of the epidemiologist while paying due attention to the living environment and social needs of each member of the community to examine the possibility of actively immunising every susceptible individual in much the same way as diphtheria prophylaxis is utilised. Of course, with Tuberculosis the population at risk is much greater, and the administrative difficulties are more formidable, but it seems that a more intensive use of B.C.G. Vaccination is indicated in the near future. During the year the Beaver Report on atmospheric pollution was published and as a result of that report it is likely that new legislation will be promoted in Parliament to assist local authorities in their work. Despite serious shortages of Sanitary Inspectors, the whole Borough was surveyed in a general way for slum clearance purposes. Areas and streets were divided preliminarily into priority groups and a tentative five year programme will be discussed with the County Council in due course. Cases of statutory overcrowding coming to our notice continued to be notified to the County. In concluding this brief introduction, I wish to acknowledge the help and support of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee. Similarly the Chief Officers have shown me much consideration, and I am glad to acknowledge the application to duty of a loyal staff. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STAFF Medical Officer of Health J. Kerr Brown, b.sc., m.b., ch.B., d.p.h. Public Analyst (part time) H.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0.93 and for deaths 1.02 and the birth-rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated decrease in the population is 1,210, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 203. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table I. The deaths are classified under 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948. Area of Borough 1,564 acres Estimated mid-year home population 73,820 1954 1953 Deptford 14.7 London 15.2 Deptford 15.0 London 17.5 Birth rate (per 1,000 living) Still births (ditto) 0.32 0.30 0.25 0.38 Death rate (ditto) 12.0 10.7 13.0 12.5 Infantile mortality rate (deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live births) 16.5 20.7 26.5 24.8 1954 1953 Live births registered (adjusted for inward and outward transfers) Legitimate 1,034 1,069 Illegitimate 55 60 Total 1,089 1,129 Still births registered Legitimate 20 18 Illegitimate 4 1 Total 24 19 13 24 Infant deaths Legitimate Illegitimate 5 6 Total 18 30 886 Total deaths 976* There was one maternal death during 1954 resulting in a maternal mortality rate of 0.89. *Of this number 122 occurred in the New Cross General Hospital. The death rate for Deptford if these deaths were excluded would be 10.3 instead of 12.0. Section "B" INFECTIOUS DISEASES INFECTIOUS DISEASES General The total number of cases of notifiable infectious disease was again below that of the previous year, a total of 521 against 827 in 1953. Scarlet Fever cases number 77 against 79, and Measles cases 236 against 429 in 1953. Food Poisoning and Sonne Dysentery showed a decline with 64 cases as against 181 in the previous year. Wherever a case was reported, contacts were tested and very often other cases were discovered. All positive cases were given letters to their medical advisors regarding treatment and specimens were taken until the patient was clear of infection. In this connection 144 specimens were submitted for examination. Arrangements were made for food handlers found to be positive to carry on non-food-handling duties until successfully treated. For the fourth successive year there was no case of Diphtheria reported. Infectious Diseases.

Tuberculosis All new cases in the Borough, whether or not they are transferred from other areas, are visited by the Sanitary Inspectors in order to ascertain the housing conditions and to see if any improvements can, or should, be effected. The deaths due to respiratory tuberculosis in Deptford in 1954 were 12 males and 8 females as compared with 19 and 6 respectively during the previous year. Of the deaths from respiratory tuberculosis 8 of the 12 male deaths and 6 of the 8 female deaths were of persons between the ages of 15 and 65 years, whereas the deaths from all causes, only about 28% were within this age group.

Od. Dr. Rigby also remarks " A very large number of cases are seen here during the year, at the request of private Doctors, for an opinion on the chest condition. You will be aware of the increase in the number of cases of cancer of the lung that have been detected both here and in many other areas in England. This problem is exercising the minds of physicians and chest surgeons who are attempting to find these growths in an 10 early stage and then trying to remove them by surgical means. Much depends on early diagnosis in these cases, and indeed in cases of pulmonary tuberculosis." Mass Miniature Radiography There was no visit from the Mass Miniature Radiography Unit in 1954. Section "C" SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES ETC., AND FACTORIES ACT 12 SANITARY INSPECTIONS General The deficiency in the Sanitary Inspector's establishment to which reference was made in my last two Annual Reports, was not made good until late December. The system of priorities to which I have referred in previous reports was, therefore, continued during 1954, but it is hoped that a return to more normal working will be realised next year. The total number of primary inspections during 1954 was 5,681, an increase of 577 upon the previous year. The number of complaints was approximately the same as last year but time was found to increase slightly the visits paid to Factories, Shops and Food premises. Towards the end of the year the impact of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act was being felt, resulting in 67 inspections being made in consequence of applications for Certificates of Disrepair. Defects found were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, the London County Council Bye-Laws and the London County Council General Powers Acts. A summary of Sanitary Work carried out in the Borough appears in Tables II and III of the Appendix to this Report. Smoke Abatement and Air Pollution It was not necessary to undertake legal proceedings or any action, other than informal during the year. The Public Health Committee decided to establish a station for the investigation of atmospheric pollution, and it is hoped that this will be installed shortly in the Public Health Department building. Offensive Trade The one factory in the Borough at which an offensive trade is carried on was kept under constant observation. Although in view of the situation of the factory I doubt if it will ever be entirely satisfactory, intelligent co-operation between the management of the factory and the staff of my Department may help to keep complaints to a minimum. Rodent Control One Rodent Supervisor and two Operators were employed throughout the year under the general direction of the Chief Sanitary Inspector, and the following tables summarise the work carried out: — 13 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1954 Type of Property Non-Agricultural (1) Local Authority (2 ).

Disinfection and Cleansing The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing:— 15 Premises disinfected (infectious disease) 134 Premises disinfected (requests) 120 Premises disinfected (verminous condition) 440 Premises disinfected (removals) 3 Total number of articles disinfected 22,064 Books disinfected 98 Number of articles destroyed at owner's request 240 In addition there was a small amount of disinfestation undertaken on behalf of the Admiralty in respect of stores of bedding at the Royal Victoria Yard, Grove Street, Deptford. Bathing Centre Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 983 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies 10 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 444 Scabies baths for adults 29 Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and efficient water supply were issued in respect of 113 new premises. THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 The following is an epitomised statement of the administration of the Act. The inspections, visits, etc., are carried out by the District Sanitary Inspectors. 16 Inspections (1) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3,4 and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities (2) Factories not included in (1) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority Number on Register 56 339 Number of Occupiers Prosecutes Notices Written Inspections 24 - - 103 - - Defects Found Referred To H.M.

Glass bottle makers. Whitening manufacturers. Laundries, cleaners. Offensive trades. Marine stores. Miscellaneous. Paint and varnish works. The number of inspections made to home workers premises was 36. The types of works carried on by the 195 outworkers in this Borough were as follows: — Wearing apparel (166), artificial flowers (3), paper bags (4), boxes (8), button cards (8), and shuttlecocks (2), paper hats (1), handbags (2) and wigs (1). Section "D" FOOD AND DRUGS AND REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST 18 FOOD AND DRUGS A full-time Food Inspector is employed in the supervision of Food and Food Premises, Food Samples are sent for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and for bacteriological examination to County Hall. Details of the work of the Food Inspector will be found in the Appendix Tables, V, VI and VII and details from the Public Analyst's Report are included at the end of this section. Royal Victoria Yard Considerable quantities of food no longer considered fit for prolonged storage by the Admiralty, are examined in order to assess their fitness for sale to the general public. Ice-Cream Forty-two samples were taken for bacteriological examination. Grade I 23 Grade II 10 Grade III 4 Grade IV 5 42 Labelling of Food Orders, 1946/50 All pre-packed samples of food submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were considered also under the Labelling of Food Orders, 1946 and 1950. Eighty separate examinations were made under these Orders and three slight infringements were dealt with by correspondence. Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941 All pre-packed drugs submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were also considered under the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. One infringement was dealt with by correspondence. Food Standards Seventy-three samples were specially examined under the various Food Standard Orders. In one instance infringement was dealt with by informal action. 19 Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations Wherever desirable Food and Drugs Act samples were examined for the presence of prohibited preservatives and colouring matters and for excessive amounts of the permitted preservatives. Three infringements were dealt with informally. Mineral Oil in Food Order, 1949 Eighty-two samples were taken under the Order —no contraventions were found. School Milks Twenty-four samples were sent for chemical examination and twenty were sent for bacteriological examination. Milk (Special Designations) Act Thirty-five samples were submitted. Foreign Bodies in Food A resident in the Borough brought a loaf to the Public Health Department which was discoloured. The loaf was sent to the Public Analyst, who reported that the loaf was contaminated by three mouse droppings and other dirty matter containing dust, fungus and decomposed flour The Vendor was summoned by the Council and he in turn summoned the Baker who had supplied the bread to him. The Baker (wholesaler) pleaded guilty and was granted an absolute discharge on the payment of £11 Os. Od. costs to the Council and costs were also awarded to the Vendor. Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949-50 Dealers Licences issued: Tuberculin Tested Milk 24 Pasteurised Milk 66 Sterilised Milk 92 Supplementary Licences issued: Tuberculin Tested Milk 15 Pasteurised Milk 15 Sterilised Milk 18 Slaughterhouses Two Slaughterhouses were licenced in the Borough. Following the derationing of meat the Slaughterhouse at 13a, Deptford High Street, came into operation again on 6th July, 1954. On 27th November, 1954, the Slaughterhouse at 180, Brockley Road, was again put into use. 20 ANIMALS SLAUGHTERED Bovines Slaughterhouse Sheep Pigs Calves Total 13a, Deptford High Street 392 87 1 50 530 180, Brockley Road 159 107 55 321 - 108 Totals 392 246 105 851 CONDEMNED 180, Brockley Road 13a, Deptford High Street Sheep Lungs 9 - Livers 3½ - Bovines Carcase and organs 1 - 17½ Liver 10 Lungs 1 10 Head - 4 Mesentery 1 3 Pigs Carcase and organs 1 - Pluck 1 - Head 1 - Mesentery 1 - Calves Carcase and organs 3 - FOOD AND DRUGS ANALYSIS Food and Drugs Analysis During the year, 402 samples were submitted for analysis under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, by Sampling Officers. These samples were also examined wherever applicable under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943, the Food Standards Orders, 1944-51, and the Labelling of Food Orders, 1946-51. Of the total number 12 were taken formally, in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Food and Drugs Act, the remaining 390 being undivided, or informal samples. 21 The Public Analyst, Dr. H. Amphlett Williams, Ph.D.(Lond.), A.C.G.F.C., F.R.1.C., has submitted the following report on milk sampling:— " I have pleasure in furnishing the following particulars summarising the composition of the milk samples submitted for analysis during the year 1954. " Only 42 samples of milk were submitted during the year, of which 12 were Sunday samples. This total shows a further reduction compared with previous years. " One sample was reported as unsatisfactory, the proportion of solidsnot-fat being one per cent, deficient, giving an ' adulteration ' percentage of 2.4. " The average composition of the samples analysed is shown in the following Table, with the averages of previous years for comparison." AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF MILK, DEPTFORD Period Fat Solids-not-fat Total Solids 1947 3.51 8.68 12.19 1948 3.45 8.72 12.17 1949 3.47 8.74 12.21 1950 3.44 8.70 12.14 1951 3.52 8.63 12.15 1952 3.48 8.69 12.17 1953 3.44 8.69 12.13 1954 3.45 8.72 12.17 As may be seen, the averages show very little variation since the end of the War, due no doubt to the Metropolitan supply being composed almost entirely of bulked milk. Eleven samples were submitted during February to April, one of which was a Channel Island Milk. Excluding this sample, the average composition of the remainder again showed the seasonal fall in solids-not-fat noted in recent years. Period Feb.-April, 1954 Fat % Solids-not-fat % Total Solids % 3.41 8.54 11.95 22 In addition to the analyses under the Food and Drugs Act, 243 other examinations under other Acts, Orders and Regulations were carried out.

The requisitioned properties housed 1,980 units of tenancy. During 1954, four flats and three houses were completed for the Council and 110 flats and 14 maisonettes were in the course of construction. During 1954, 4,238 improvements were carried out in 1,420 houses, somewhat less than last year, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 305. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1954:— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 2,412 Number of Statutory Notices served 673 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 1,420 Overcrowding Number of individual dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 80 Number of families found to be living in over- crowded conditions during the year 23 Number of families who have obtained alter- native accommodation during the year 31 There are many underground rooms throughout the Borough and a fairly high proportion of them, although used as dwellings, do not conform in all respects with the statutory requirements and cannot without major structural alterations be made to do so. Closure is not, however, practicable in present circumstances and owners have been co-operative in making these rooms reasonably fit. Housing Repairs and Rents Act and Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts Certificates of Disrepair were granted in 31 cases during the year. Slum Clearance Owing to the shortage of Sanitary Inspector's staff a comprehensive and detailed survey has been out of the question. A limited classification of areas and individual houses has been made however, in connection with the next five years' Housing programme. Section "F" PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES 28 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES The services which are provided by the London County Council at the various clinics are as follows :— Health Centre, Amersham Road, S.E. 14.

The headquarters of the Divisional Medical Officer are also at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street. Section " G " MISCELLANEOUS 30 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection. Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service Food samples are normally sent to the Medical Research Laboratory at County Hall, but clinical items, e.g., faeces specimens, continue to be sent to the Park Hospital Laboratories. The facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, are occasionally used by general practitioners for the examination of swabs and other specimens. Mortuary and Coroner's Court Before the war both the Boroughs of Deptford and Greenwich maintained their own mortuaries and coroner's courts. By arrangement, and following war damage, the coroner's court at Deptford and the mortuary at Greenwich have been closed. The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, greatly increased. The number of bodies received during 1954 was 570, of which 215 were received from Greenwich and 262 from Woolwich. A fee of £1 Is. Od. per body is paid by the Greenwich and Woolwich Borough Councils in respect of these admissions. National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to 31 arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. Six persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1954. Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for securing the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. Several cases were removed either to hospital or County Council homes for the aged after persuasion, but it was necessary to invoke Section 47 in one case during the year. Services for Old People The voluntary services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five Darby and Joan Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the district. In addition, the Albany Institute Old People's Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly by Deptford people. A Meals-on-Wheels service operates in the Borough. This supplies meals to aged and infirm people in their homes twice a week, to five of the Darby and Joan Clubs once a week, and to the Albany Institute daily from Monday to Friday. The meals are obtained from the London County Council's meals service and supplied to the old people at a charge of 10d. each. The vehicle was supplied and fitted by the Borough Council, which also provides the driver and maintains the vehicle. The remainder of the work is done by members of the W.V.S. Shops Act, 1950 In the course of their routine inspection the Sanitary Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of " break-point" chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. 32 At the baths at Ilderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Eight applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council and granted. Medical Examinations During the year 19 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme. Fifty-three examinations of sick employees were also made during the year and reports submitted thereon. Conferences The Council was represented at Conferences during the year as follows: Royal Sanitary Institute —Scarborough. The Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor W. Taylor, J.P.) and the Medical Officer of Health. National Smoke Abatement Society—Scarborough. The Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor Mrs. A. M. Ott) and the Medical Officer of Health. Sanitary Inspectors' Association—Southport Mr. H. E. Green, Sanitary Inspector.

The payment of fees for a Meat Refresher Course was also authorised in the case of one Inspector.
