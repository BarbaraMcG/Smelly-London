EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT, Pursuant to the 198th section of Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. The Board of Works for the Fulham District present to their constituents the following Report of their proceedings for the year ending 25th March, 1864, together with an Account in abstract of Contracts, Receipts, and Expenditure; and also the Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of cases removed during the year are:— Privies and Cesspools emptied 344 Drains and Gullies cleansed and repaired 323 Houses ditto ditto 124 Swine Nuisances removed 41 Miscellaneous 130 962 Houses benefited in Fulham 715 „ „ „ Hammersmith 683 1398 The Board have constructed a Sewer in King Street West, from the Bridge Road Sewer to the Creek, at a cost of £4176: 1: 1, towards which the Metropolitan Board of Works have agreed to contribute £1550. The sum of £2300 for the making of this sewer was raised by loan from the British Empire Mutual Life Assurance Company, at 4½ per cent. interest, repayable by twenty equal annual instalments of £176: 16: 3 each. An Abstract of the Mortgages therein are annexed hereto. It is with satisfaction the Board have to state, that many of the owners of property along the line of sewer have freely availed themselves of the advantages thus afforded to effectually drain their premises. The Board in taking measures for carrying out the other parts of the scheme of Local Drainage have contracted with the Royal Exchange Assurance Company for a loan of £39,018, at 5 per cent. per annum, repayable by thirty equal annual instalments. £20,000 of this loan will be available for the construction of the following sewers during the ensuing year: Brook Green Sewer, from the Shepherd's Bush Road to the High Road at Mr. Hunt's corner; King Street East Sewer, from the Broadway to the point of junction with the Brook Green Sewer at Mr. Hurst's corner; High Road Sewer, from Mr. Hurst's corner, eastward, to North End; Walham Green Sewer, from North End to Walham Green; Sun Street Sewer; and Parson's Green Lane Sewer. 4 The Board hope to have these several sewers finished at about the time when the Outlet of the Main Drainage Works of the District will be available. The Board, deeming it of the utmost importance to the sanitary condition of the District, have repeatedly urged upon the Metropolitan Board the absolutely necessity of abandoning the open Stamford Brook Sewer, and of diverting it course, so that a deep and efficient sewer might be made along the New Road to the Great Western Road at St. Peter's Square, and from thence to the Creek and also of the great importance of making an efficient sewer along the Grove and they have great satisfaction in stating their belief that these necessary work will soon be in progress. The Board during the autumn of last year entered into new contracts with the Brentford and Western Gas Companies on more eligible terms than here tofore, whereby a saving to the Parish of Hammersmith has been effected of £246: 15: 0 per annum in the cost of the supply of gas to the public lamps. The Board have, under the 77th section of the last Amendment Act, sucure cessfully dealt with St. George's Road and Clifton Street; are now dealing with Latymer Road and Masboro' Road North; and they hope that the anomalours state of things with reference to such streets which existed previously to the passing of that Act will soon be at an end. The Board, in estimating for the precepts for the ensuing year, will have to consider what addition must be made to the General Rate, in consequence of having to take to the Turnpike Roads on the 1st July next, and when the maintenance of such roads will become a parochial obligation. The effect they apprehend will be a very considerable increase of that rate ; but they however hope that as the rateable value of the District is rapidly increasing, the pressure upon individual rate-payers will not be so severely felt as at first might have been anticipated. Abstract of Contracts entered into by the Board during the Year ending 25th March, 1864. Mrs. Coat, for paving and masonry works, at certain prices set forth in the schedule, and embodied in the contract. Mrs. Coat, for works of cartage, at per day of 10 hours, in strong and well-made carts, each attended by one man, and drawn by one horse, 7s. per day; or, at the option of the Board, at 1s. per journey, average to or from any part of the district, the man attending to assist in loading the cart. Mr. Turner, for the supply of the best gray pit Hints, at 5s. 4d. per cube yard. Mrs. Coat, for works of slopping for Hammersmith and Fulham, for 12 months. £30 each parish. Messrs. J. & E. Bird, for the removal of dust, ashes, &c., from the several houses, yards, and premises, in the parish of Hammersmith, for 12 months, they paying for the same £60. Mr. Johnson, for the removal of dust, ashes, &c., from the several houses, yards, and premises, in the parish of Fulham, he paying for the same £10. Mr. Churchman, for printing and stationery, at certain prices set forth in the schedule, and embodied in the contract. AUDITORS' CERTIFICATE. We hereby certify that, we have carefully examined the accounts and books of counts of the Board of Works for the Fulham District, for the year ending 5th March, 1864, and have compared them with the vouchers, and find the Overal receipts and entries thereof to be correct; we also certify to the correct-:ss of the abstract of accounts, together with the assets and liabilities to the veral parishes. We found a balance at the bankers at the commencement of the year of the aim of £1763: 3: 0, and at the close of the audit we leave a balance of 451: 9: 3, the liabilities of each parish being clearly shewn in the abstracts to be published. We find that the balances due from the Overseers of Hammersmith on recepts dated the 17th June, 1863, amount to £1150 11 9 and from Fulham Overseers on precepts of the same date 1602 13 2 a Total of £2753 4 11 And we take this opportunity of suggesting to the Board a more speedy settlement of their precepts, as an act of justice to all parties. The Board:ould then have a sufficient balance to pay their accounts, and those ratelayers leaving the District before the closing of the several rates would not cape their just parochial liabilities.

EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Board of Works, Fulham District. Gentlemen, In taking a review of the Sanitary condition of the Fulham District through the past year, it is satisfactory to observe that on comparison with the general health of London we have much reason for congratulation. The year 1863 has been somewhat characterized by an excess of sickness throughout the greater portion not only of the Metropolitan Districts but of the country at large. Diseases of a Zymotic character have prevailed, and these have not been limited to town localities. Villages and watering places have had an undue share of sickness and mortality, and quadrupeds as well as bipeds have suffered from the epidemic influences. The general mortality of London (2.452 percent) has been above the average. The excess has arisen principally from diseases of a Zymotic character, Small Pox and Scarlatina being the most marked contributors to it. The records of the mortality in the Fulham District for the year 1863 show a total of 929 deaths, against 922 for the previous year, an increase of only seven. This increase occurring during what may be called an epidemic year, and taking into account the increase of population, is certainly not large, and specially when wc lake it in connection with the extensive Main Drainage Works in The course of execution in Fulham, through which a considerable temporary influx of labouring people has arisen. There are no direct means by which a correct estimate of the increase of population, either of London in general, or of any particular district of it, from year to year, can be arrived at, but calculations upon so large a scale, based upon existing elements of known extent, seldom differ materially from the actual results determined at the various Censuses. The Registrar General in his Annual Report for 1863, says: "The population of London is so vast, that it is subject to no accidental fluctuations; yet as the tide in some years carries more and sometimes less water from the sea into the Thames, so in some years the stream of new comers into the population rises above and sometimes falls below the standard. The observations on the movement of the population have hitherto given, as the result of income and outgo, clear proofs of the greater strength of the influx, and judging by the past, about 44,269 souls were added to the population in the year 1863: 31,062 by excess of births, 13,207 by cxccss of immigrants over emigrants." Experience has proved that Hammersmith and Fulham quite keep pace with this ordinary general increase in their several populations. The more active development of their individual handicrafts gives us annually a large accession to our labouring people, whilst the great extension of building operations naturally contributes many of the better classes. The diseases of the Zymotic class which have prevailed, as shown by their effects on the mortality of Fulham and Hammersmith during the past year, have been Measles and Diarrhoea, the former giving 33, the latter 43; 36 deaths have occurred from Scarlatina, and 27 from various types of continued fever. 9 Diptheria has cut off 21 persons. Of the 43 deaths from Diarrhoea, 30 took place in the three months July, August, and September. Phthisis has destroyed 117 lives. The infant mortality for 1863 has been again high; of the 929 deaths 420 or 45 per cent. had not reached five years of age, and of these 214 had not attained one year. The diseases which last year produced this destruction of infant life were, Miasmatic, 140; Tubercular, 58; Diseases of the Brain and Nervous System, 34; Diseases of the Organs of Respiration, 68; Diseases of Nutrition, 45 ; Accident or Negligence, 12; and Parasitic, 8: leaving 55 from other causes. The deaths from Parasitic diseases are worthy of remark, since they point directly to the use of impure food for their origin—the milk of diseased cows in all probability being the special source. The mortality of elderly persons is not without its interest also, 113 persons having attained 70 years and upwards: 64 deaths occurred in persons between 70 and 80, 42 between 80 and 90, six between 90 and 100, and one person was aged 101 years at death. The latter was a respectable inhabitant of Fulham for many years. The smallest number of deaths (66) occurred in February, and the largest (90) in December. The smallest number of deaths (12) from Zymotic diseases occurred in March, the largest (24) in December. Of the deaths from Tubercular diseases, February contributed the smallest number (7), and August the largest (20). January, February, March, April, and June, gave 13, 13, 14, 14, 14, respectively, from Diseases of the Organs of Respiration, the lowest number (3) arising in October. Diseases of Nutrition have destroyed 46 lives, 45 of which were infants. 27 deaths have been produced by Accident or Negligence, 2 by Homicide, and 3 by Suicide. The number of deaths in Lunatic Asylums have been 15, in Alms-Houses 24, in the Union-House 54, and in the West London Hospital 7. 55 Inquests have been held, 38 in Hammersmith and 17 in Fulham. 1459 births have been registered during the year, shewing an increase of 530 over the deaths. It cannot be expected that Sanitary measures and appliances shall have an absolute and perfect control over diseases of a Zymotic character. These maladies are called preventible, since we have without a doubt a large and highly evidenced power of mitigating their effects. They are of more importance because though manifestly subject in a great degree to atmospheric influences, they are prone to fix themselves on large communities, and in proportion to indifference to sanitary measures, their virulence and progress are either stayed or developed. The Sanitary exertions of the past and previous years in the Fulham District have I am sure not been without their fruit. In accordance with your annual custom, the recorded details of the Sanitary work of the year will be included in the Annual Report of the Board. No absolutely correct statement however can be made as to the exact number: ot houses benefited by the Sanitary inspections of your officers, since it occurs i in many instances that houses which although somewhat dirty, are not sufficiently unwholesome to justify compulsory proceedings, are cleansed by the landlords on being informed of its being desirable to do so. This salutary effect has been gained by a temperate exercise of the powers of the law, and landlords of small property, as a rule, are becoming much more willing to fall in with the requirements of Sanitary Officers. The condition of many of the poorer dwellings has shewn a marked improvement; and though there is still 10 much property of a very wretched description, especially in Fulham, diseases of an infectious character have been deprived of many of their wonted opportunities for spreading. Radical defects, however, in construction render all ones efforts far from satisfactory in dealing with many cottages of our poor. Built of most wretched refuse bricks, of timber in which worm and canker have for many years been revelling, with plastering and mortar of such loose cohesive power, that the walls defy the hottest days in summer to dry them. A general carelessness and inattention to cleanly habits amongst the occupants adds considerably to our difficulties, whilst constant tendencies to overcrowding, with want of proper drainage and supply of water, complete the list of disadvantages. The present law, as applicable to overcrowding, is eminently deficient, for I have seen as lamentable instances of packing human beings in cottages occupied by single families as possibly can happen in any held by two or more. The 29th section of the Nuisances Removal Act takes cognizance ordy of the latter, whilst single families, however numerous, can herd together with comparative impunity and recklessness. This with other manifest deficiencies in this Sanitary Statute have long occupied the attention of the Metropolitan Association of Officers of Health. The practical defects which were alluded to in my Report for 1850 have in many districts been often and severely felt, and call for an amended Act. The power to prevent improper detention of dead bodies, an unrestricted power to enforce a supply of pure and wholesome water for domestic purposes, to carry out the removal of infected persons from crowded neighbourhoods, and to prevent the exposure of persons suffering from infectious diseases, such as Fever and Small-Pox, in the public streets and vehicles, in fact an incorporation of some of the provisions of the Diseases Prevention Act, without the necessity for a special Order in Council, is required. Some effort should be made by Vestries and District Boards to urge upon the Government to take this subject into their consideration. An amended Bill should also give the local authority some power to issue regulations under the sanction of the Secretary of State for the conduct of some of the more offensive trades within their district. The supply of enormous quantities of diseased meat to the London markets still demands the attention of the authorities, for although in the City of London many tons are annually seized, there is yet an immense amount which escapes detection, or is without the pale of that authority, and this finds its way to the sausage makers or to the low-class butchers of the poorer neighbourhoods. The baneful influence of such supply on public health cannot be over stated; so great indeed has been the spread of contagious maladies amongst cattle that the attention of the Government has been engaged in framing an Act of Parliament for their prevention, and for regulating the sale of cattlc in fairs and markets. The poor however are not the only class to whom this subject carries interest. The flesh of animals slaughtered under various stages of diseases capable of conveying poison to the human system, does not in every instance present that outward visible appearance as shall command attention from untutored eyes, and hence the parts of many such supply the tables of the better classes, subject only to the scrutiny of domestic servants. The heads of families should carefully examine from time to time the meat supplied. The ordinary characters of sound and wholesome meat arc firmness of texture, with, at any rate, a moderate amount of fat. The surface of a recent cut should present a bright 11 and clear appearance, free from immediate exudation of blood or slimy fluid. The external surface lying; underneath the skin should be free from the appearance of bruises, and the inside portions of the ribs and flank pieces should present a clear and glistening effect, and not be smeared with melted fat, a practice commonly adopted by low-class butchers in dressing meat from animals which have either died or been slaughtered whilst labouring under internal disease. An undue shrinking of the meat in careful cooking is also an indication of want of quality. It must be borne in mind however that weather has considerable effect in modifying the appearance of a joint, and the ordinary practice of exposing meat in open shops in hot and dusty weather considerably darkens its external surface, but a clean and recent cut develops its character. These indications must only be considered in a popular light, and serve for general guidance. More subtle evidences of disease can only be detected by practised experts. WATER SUPPLY. I am desirous at this juncture to direct the attention of the Board to the great deficiency in the supply of water to a considerable portion of the Fulham District. This disadvantage is more especially experienced in the Parish of Fulham, where a very large number of the inhabitants are actually without any. The water clause of the Nuisances Removal Act applies only to closets, but the absence of drainage in many parts has hitherto prevented its extended application, whilst that of the Metropolis Local Management Act, from the paucity of water mains in the District, is also inoperative to a great extent. The defects of these Acts, as at present existing, have occupied the anxious attention of the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health, and an effort was made to induce the Government to undertake their amendment during the past session, but without success. I am of opinion that the attention of the West Middlesex, Grand Junction, and Chelsea Water Companies should be called to this subject, and that they should be requested to consider the propriety of largely extending their several mains throughout the Fulham District. The present moment is especially favourable for its discussion, since the expense of the ground work might be materially lessened to the Water Companies by arrangements with the Contractors for the several Sewer Works about to be commenced in Fulham. No greater boon can be conferred on a community than that of amply providing a supply of this great necessary of life. THAMES WATER. I have from time to time through the past year examined the water taken at high and low water at the Hammersmith Suspension Bridge, with a view to ascertain its present general condition, and for comparison with what it might ultimately be expected to be when the sewage of the neighbourhood is wholly diverted from it. My investigations go to prove that the Thames at Hampton (compared with the body of water and extent of sewage at the two points,) is not comparatively so pure, as a source of water supply, as might have been expected. The table attached hereto shows the amount of inorganic and organic constituents of the water at Hammersmith in juxtaposition with the Reports of Dr. R. D. Thompson of the water as taken from the supply pipes of the different Water Companies, after undergoing filtration, &c. This is not so much a matter of surprise when we contemplate the mass of sewage poured into the river from the many large towns in its route. Kingston, 12 Chertsey, Staines, Windsor, Eton, Reading, Oxford, and a host of minor places, all pour their filthy refuse into its stream, always flowing in an uninterrupted current towards the point from which it is drawn for London use. It appears therefore a matter of doubt whether the processes of purification and filtration adopted by the various Water Companies deriving their water from the Thames, are Yet as near perfection as they ought to be. The following table shows the relative impurities of the water under the circumstances spoken of. Date. State of Tide. THAMES WATER, taken at Hammersmith Bridge.

Very few cases of actual nuisance have arisen from them, though I have occasionally found it necessary to give recommendations for improved management. Neither cow-keepers nor butchers however, I am sure, feel the requirements of the several Acts in any way oppressive, but on the contrary, admit that a large benefit has been conferred on each branch of trade. The prevalence of great sickness and mortality amongst the cows of the London dairies for several years, has been a source of much anxiety and loss to their owners, whilst the importance of its bearing on the public health cannot be overrated. There is reason to believe that much of this damage has been attributable to defective management, but the present fearful ravages of diseases amongst cattle in the country at large can only be effectually dealt with by legislative enactment. 13 METEOROLOGY. The mean reading of the Barometer for the year has been 29.983. Mean Temperature 50.3. Mean Humidity 80. (Saturation 100.) Mean amount of Ozone 25. Mean Cloud 7. The total amount of Rain has been 21.225 inches which has fallen on 167 days. The shock of an earthquake was distinctly felt by several inhabitants between three and four o'clock in the morning of October 6th. As the BAKEHOUSE REGULATION ACT Has only recently come into operation, I deem it right to call your attention to its objects and provisions. The condition of the journeyman baker has for many years been a subject of inquiry both by the government and the people at large. The object of the investigation has been of a threefold character:—1st. Into the social and physical condition of a class of workmen, who from the nature of their occupation and the custom of the trade, have been exposed to an extraordinary amount of continuous labour. 2ndly. Into the effect of such labour, combined with exposure to an impure atmosphere in close, heated, illventilated bakehouses, for several hours during the night, and also into the class of diseases which are most frequently engendered thereby. 3rdly. Into the character and position of the buildings in which this labour is performed. There can be no doubt that the journeymen bakers, as a rule, are a sickly, short-lived body of men,- and it is with a view to an improvement in their condition that the Bakehouse Regulation Act has been recently passed. The provisions of this statute apply more directly in their operation to the bakehouses, rather than to the men, and in order to trace their connection with the latter, it will be necessary briefly to refer to the special diseases to which these operatives are liable, and how they are associated in their development with the character of the places in which their labour is performed. A pale and bloodless skin, a sunken eye, a cheerless tone of countenance attracts the eye of the observer: a weak and feeble pulse, too frequently a hectic cough, and a general want of vigour, with a dry and scaly skin, give further indications of impaired health in the journeyman baker. Dr. Guy who has paid most special attention to this subject has given a fearful though truthful history of the prevailing ailments of this class of operatives. The causes of these maladies he gives, are:—The large amount of work in underground apartments, more or less shut out from light of day. Defective drainage and imperfect ventilation. The suffocating gusts of heated air encountered at the oven's mouth. Vapours of coal gas most generally used for lighting purposes. The irritating action of the dust of flour on the larynx and air tubes. The long hours of work, extending through the night and greater part ot the day, with severe muscular exertion, a labour carried on not in a pure but in a heated and contaminated atmosphere. The short and irregular hours appropriated to rest and sleep. The same authority, whilst speaking of the liability of the journeymen bakers to severe attacks of general illness, asserts, that whiist he found 10 in the hundred among the scavengers, 11 iu the hundred amongst the bricklayers' labourers, and 12 in the hundred among the silk printers who had had severe attacks of illness, 48 in the hundred, or very nearly half the entire number of 14 journeymen bakers had suffered in the same way. The brickmakers alone bore any comparison in this respect, their proportion being 46 per cent. The special diseases however to which the journeyman baker is liable are those of the lungs and air passages. And here the comparison is equally striking, for taking the compositors, a very sickly class of operatives, it has been found that whilst amongst these, about 24 per cent. were liable to chest affections, no less than 80 per cent. of journeymen bakers were so affected, and taking Hcemoptysis (or spitting of blood) alone, the journeymen bakers suffered in the proportion of 31 per cent. of their numbers, whilst the compositors gave only about 12 per cent. It is not to be expected that the journeymen bakers of the Fulham District form any exception to this general rule, they are indeed for the most part of weak physical construction, pale and careworn in appearance. The number of bakehouses in the Fulham District, including those of confectioners and piemen, are 65: in Hammersmith, 40; in Fulham, 25. The number of journeymen employed in them being 86, whilst 45 masters take part of the work with their men; 13 lads and one woman. Of the bakehouses, 32 are above and 33 under ground, their dimensions varying from 27 ft. × 9 ft. by 6 ft. in height to 9 ft. × 9 ft. by 8 ft. 53 are lighted by gas, and 12 by other means. Their general condition has presented every phase from one of perfect cleanliness, to that of the greatest negligence, and the personal appearances of the men have given similar results. In anticipation of my visit some of the bakehouses had been partially cleansed, but as a rule, great laxity has evidently existed in the general management of these workshops. The walls and ceilings in many instances were found very discoloured and covered with dust and cobwebs, the floors much out of repair and excessively dirty, and the atmosphere heated and unwholesome. The ventilation comprised every condition between that which is sufficient and an almost entire absence of this necessary provision. The principal outlet in use for the gases and air of the bakehouses, in some, have been either into the shop or the dwelling house, and even where other outlets have been available for this purpose and windows of ample dimensions exist they have been allowed totally to fall into disuse. It is a remarkable feature amongst the underground bakehouses of the district, that in Fulham, the height of eight did not exceed 7 feet, whilst that of five was only 6 feet. In Hammersmith there are five in which the height does not exceed 7 feet, and seven in which the height is only 6 feet, showing that nearly 41 per cent of the whole number in the district are thus deficient in one important particular. It is specially to be noticed that with a few exceptions much carelessness exists in regard to general cleanliness. Partly, this depends upon the master, but greatly on the man. I have found more than one bakehouse the depository for all the lumber of the household, and in the great majority of cases the sweepings of the floor mixed with ashes from the furnace accumulated in quantity beneath the troughs. As a rule too, coal for, and the ashes from the furnace are kept side by side upon the floor, extending over several feet of surface and trampled on by the workmen, increasing considerably the dusty impurity of the: air of the apartment. The mode of working and the hours of labour vary much, depending on the views of the master or the extent of trade. I find, as a rule, the sponge is set at from 7 or 8 to 11 o'clock p.m., and the labour of preparing the dough begins at hours varying at different bakers from 1 to 4 or 5 o'clock a.m. 15 Now, how this interval is spent by the journeymen, forms a very important question in carrying out the provisions of this Act. The master baker admits his workmen to the bakehouse before he retires to his rest, and it is not unusual for the men to be locked within the precincts of the bakehouse for the night. The sponge being set (according to the prevailing system of fermenting) requires a certain time to rise. The operation being thus initiated the journeyman suspends his labour, and drowsily collecting empty sacks to serve for rug and pillow he lays himself down upon the troughs on which the bread is made, to catch what sleep he can. It is this practice which the fifth section of the Act is framed especially to disallow. It is during this time that the temperature of the bakehouse is raised, the doors and windows are closed and all external air as far as possible excluded, and thus enveloped in sacks and in a highly carbonized atmosphere, the workman sleeps a sleep almost of death. The temperature required for successful fermentation is about 70° of Fahrenheit, but as the process is at present conducted in the generality of bakehouses, everything is done by guess. The baker knows a certain warmth is necessary for its accomplishment, but with a singular occultness of intelligence, imagines it is necessary to stew the journeyman simultaneously with his flour. No attempt whatever appears to be made to confine the increased temperature to the troughs, or to collect the gases arising from the fermentation, and thus protect the workmen from these most deleterious agents, but the object is rudely accomplished by raising the heat of the entire apartment to the requisite pitch. The section of the Act runs thus:—"No place on the same level with a bakehouse situate in any city, town, or place, containing according to the last census a population of more than five thousand persons, and forming part of the same building, shall be used as a sleeping place, unless it is constructed as follows; that is to say, unless it is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling: unless there be an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which, at the least four and a half superficial feet are made to open for ventilation. And any person who lets, occupies, or continues to let, or knowingly suffers to be occupied, any place contrary to this Act, shall be liable for the first, offence to a penalty not exceeding twenty shillings, and for every subsequent offence to a penalty not exceeding five pounds." An examination of the Bakehouses of the Fulham District has shewn, that, although in the majority of instances separate sleeping rooms ostensibly exist, there is in my opinion a wholesale infringement of what this statute is intended to suppress, viz:—men using the bakehouse as a sleeping place during some portion of the night. The interval between the setting of the sponge and making up the dough, is, I believe, as a rule, thus occupied. It is also to be observed that many of the sleeping rooms devoted to the journeyman's use, even during his short hours of rest, are underground in close contiguity to the closet and the bakehouse, by the heated gases of which their air is much contaminated, so whilst resting from his toil he is still exposed to the exhausting influence of impure air. To carry out the spirit and the very objects of this Act will entail a patient and persevering effort to abolish this injurious custom. Its importance cannot be over rated when we consider that in this metropolis alone, the journeymen bakers are not less in number than 12,000, and that the physical and social condition of such a body must have some significance in its bearing on the common weal. It is at present impossible to separate the question of night work from its connection with this subject, but time and the hearty co-operation of the 16. trade arc required to prove whether such be actually necessary. It is satisfactory to observe that a large number of the masters are favourable to its abolition, and the journeymen would be only too glad to realize it. In the Bakehouse Regulation Act a great deficiency exists in laying down no order for future guidance in the construction of bakehouses. To illustrate the consequence of this, which will inevitably arise, it will be necessary merely to give one instance within the Fulham District. In the case of a bakehouse in Prospcet Place, Starch Green, the house and shop which have been very recently constructed, stand upon a plot of ground of sufficient depth only to allow of their erection. There is no back outlet, and only a space of about three feet behind on which are placed the privy and dustbin. The bakehouse is underneath the shop, the only approach to which is a trap door in the shop floor. Its height in only about eight feet, with merely a small window 4 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 4 in. for ventilation. So great indeed has been the carelessness in the construction of these premises, and the utter disregard for the ordinary requirements of a family, that this house is literally without a kitchen. Now such a place is absolutely unlit for the purposes of a bakehouse. With one of such construction, immediately underneath the house, the gases and impure air from it find vent at once into the dwelling part. An amended Act should not permit such Flagrant inattention to what is proper. The schedule attached hereto shews the individual character of the bakehouses of the District, to the details of which I beg to refer the Sanitary Committee. It will be satisfactory to the Board to be informed, that, as a rule, the master bakers of the Fulham District have received my inspections with good nature, though in a few instances where defective arrangements existed, some desire to evade the operation of the Act was evidenced. I have little doubt, however, that by a temperate exercise of the powers vested in your officers, such a general improvement will be accomplished in the management of the bakehouses, as shall prove satisfactory both to the trade and to you as the local authorities. Notwithstanding alt that has been said and written on the value and cleanliness of machinery for the making of bread, it is remarkable that in the Fulham District we have scarcely an instance in which it is rendered available for this purpose. With the exception of at Messrs. Morison, Butlin, and Stephens no machines arc found, and in the cases of the two latter they merely exist in name. The old hand and arm process, with all its palpable nastiness, is persevered in despite the arguments of the public press, and of those who have paid the most careful attention to this subject. It has been urged that bread manufactured by machinery is not so inviting to the eye as that made by the hand, that it loses in sweetness to lie palate, is of closer texture, and loses its moisture quickly; but all this even if admitted, is a mere matter of imperfection, easily to be overcome in this age, when machine work in other departments of trade is brought to assimilate so closely with handwork, and does not materially militate against the advantages of clean and wholesome bread.
