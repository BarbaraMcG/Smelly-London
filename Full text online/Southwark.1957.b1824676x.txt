The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. YOUR WORSHIP, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1957. Vital Statistics The Registrar General has estimated the population of the Metropolitan Borough at mid-year 1957 to be 91,140. This is 1,160 fewer than in 1956 and is the lowest estimate of the population since 1946. The 1951 census figure was 97,191. On the other hand the birth rate was 18.1 per 1,000 of population and was higher than last year (17.5) and the highest since 1950. The general death rate of 12 per 1,000 population was slightly lower than that of last year (12.9). Adjustment of these crude rates by application of the appropriate comparability factor shows that the adjusted birth rate in Southwark was at 16.1 per 1,000 of population, exactly the same as England and Wales, while the adjusted death rate of 10.8 was lower than the death rate for England and Wales which was 11.5. The infant death rate of 22.3 per 1,000 live births although higher than the record figure of 16 per 1,000 live births in 1956, was similar to the infant death rate for the country as a whole, which in 1957 was 23.0. The still-birth rate was 24.7 total births and was higher than last year (18.7) and higher than the corresponding national figure which was 22.4. Once more it is pleasing to record that during 1957, as in 1956, there were no maternal deaths in Southwark. Infectious Disease The year 1957 did not see a repetition of the epidemic of dysentery which occurred the previous year. Only 36 cases were notified as compared to 716 during 1956. Towards the middle of the year it became apparent that there was to be an outbreak of measles and a total of 1,179 cases were notified. There were no deaths from this condition. A total of 188 cases of Whooping Cough were notified, again with no deaths. Of the four cases of Poliomyelitis Paralytic which were notified, two have removed from the Borough. The remaining two, a girl of nine and a boy of five, both are in good health although there remains some disability of the left leg in both cases. A decrease of ten in the number of notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis which were received during the year as compared to 1956 was offset by an increase of fourteen in the number of inward transfers. There were seven fewer deaths from this condition. In common with ii other parts of the country Southwark experienced an increased incidence of a relatively mild form of influenza, a non-notifiable infectious disease, which commenced towards the end of September, 1957. Ten deaths were attributable to this condition as compared to five during the previous year. Environmental Health The year under review saw an important advance in the environmental health field in so far as the Public Health Committee gave favourable consideration (and in the early part of 1958, approval in principle) to the establishment of a smoke control area in the mainly residential district, bounded by Walworth Road, Trafalgar Street, Dawes Street, and Westmoreland Road. Housing An increased number of persons were rehoused on medical grounds during 1957 as compared with former years. A survey of overcrowded families showed some improvement in the position and a substantially smaller number of families remained overcrowded at the end of the year. Old People's Welfare Despite accommodation difficulties the work of the Old People's Welfare Committee continued uninterrupted during the year and details of the various activities are set out in Miss Beer's report. In so far as the Council is concerned the year under review saw the inception of a laundry service for incontinent persons being nursed at home. This was a very valuable innovation which has made and continues to make an important contribution to the health and comfort of old people living in their own homes. Conclusion My thanks are due to the Members of the Council for their encouragement and consideration and to the Chief Officials for their kind co-operation since coming to Southwark. I wish also to thank the staff of the Public Health Department for their efforts during 1957. Although it has fallen to me to present this report, it will be appreciated that during the year to which it refers, the work of the Public Health Department was carried out under the direction of my predecessor, Dr. W. Stott. The Council have caused an appreciation of Dr. Stott's long and outstanding service in Southwark to be recorded in the Minutes. It only remains for me to express my personal thanks to him for his kindness and helpfulness to me when I came South, and to wish him every happiness in his retirement. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, A.D.C.S. CAMERON. Medical Officer of Health. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (As at 31st December, 1957). Mayor—J.B.

The Centre's laundry was rebuilt and modern laundry machinery was installed during the early part of the year. In June, a laundry service was commenced to deal with the bedding and clothing of sick and old people coming within the scope of section 122 of the Public Health Act. There is no doubt that this service is of considerable assistance, and solves a serious problem for many old people. The number of School children requiring treatment for vermin infestation decreased by 8% on last year's figures, but this decrease was offset by a considerable rise in the number of treatments given to adult persons of both sexes. In the case of male adult persons, the increase occurred in the numbers that were sent from the various lodging houses in the Borough and would appear to indicate that a strict supervision of their lodgers is being maintained in these places. Normally, we are now informed by the Lodging Mouses when an occupant is being sent for treatment and arrangements are then made for the collection of bedding and personal effects for disinfestation. Figures for the disinfestation of vermin in domestic premises during the year again show a considerable reduction. This continued decrease in the post-war years of the need for this type of disinfestation, i.e., bed bug and flea infestations, is without doubt, due not onlyto a general improvement in housing conditions, but also to the wide range and efficacy of modern insecticides. Considerable nuisance during the warmer months, resulted from infestations of clover mites, (Bryobia praetiosa) in a number of Council properties adjoining Parks and other spaces where trees and plants had been recently planted. Although they do no harm in the house, these minute agricultural pests cause considerable alarm when they invade premises in their hundreds of thousands. A number of other Metropolitan Boroughs have experienced similar infestations of these pests in their Housing Estates where newly formed gardens have been stocked. It would appear that the Clover Mite at least, does not object to the atmospheric conditions of Metropolitan London and, in fact, thrives when brought in from its more natural rural environment. A large amount of precautionary disinfestation work has been carried out during the year. The bedding of 270 families rehoused by the Borough Council and of 50 families rehoused by the L.C.C. was treated at the Centre before the families moved into their new accommodation. 10 Infectious Disease Cases: Enquiries and Visits.

COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are four women's and two men's common lodging houses in the Borough, which are fully occupied nightly. 97 inspections of these premises were made by the Public Health Inspectors during the year, 58 of men's lodging houses and 39 of women's. Two intimation notices were served, both of which have been complied with. OFFENSIVE TRADES There are now three premises engaged in offensive trades in the Borough as follows:—Skin Dressers 2, Manure Manufacturer 1. During 1957, 45 inspections were made. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 Fifteen applications were received during the year for registration under the Act, all of which were satisfactory. 257 Inspections were made during the year. WATER SUPPLY The domestic water supply of the 3orough is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. During the year, one complaint was received. The Metropolitan Water Board was informed and a sample analysed, which was found satisfactory. Public Health (London) Act, 1936—Section 98 During the year 16 notifications of the withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board.

The main function, in so far as the Public Health Department is concerned, is in regard to the issue of Certificates of Disrepair, during the continuation of which, rent cannot be increased. The following table gives a summary of the action taken from 6th July to the end of the year: Certificates of Disrepair Number of applications 161 Number of decisions to issue certificates 133 Number of undertakings by landlords to carry out repairs 80 Certificates issued 17 Certificates refused Nil Applications withdrawn 3 RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 During the year three samples were taken and submitted to the prescribed Analyst, Mr. G. Ginger, F.C.S., Chiltern Research Laboratories, Ltd., Marlow. All these samples complied with the requirements of the Regulations. Ten premises are registered for the use of filling materials, and two licensed for manufacture or storage of Rag Flock. WELL WATER The three private wells in the Borough are still in use for industrial purposes. The supply in each case is satisfactory. 19 HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS In accordance with Section 18 of the L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, 1954, relating to hairdressers and barbers' establishments, five such premises were registered during the year, making a total of 70. DISCHARGE OF TRADE EFFLUENTS INTO SEWERS In accordance with the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953, investigations have been carried out in connection with the drainage of trade premises. Twelve samples of trade effluent have been submitted by the Public Health Inspectors to the Public Analyst, and of these six were unsatisfactory. The analyst found matter which was likely to injure the sewer or interfere with the free flow of its contents, or would be dangerous or the cause of nuisance. The attention of the owners was drawn to the unsatisfactory effluent in each case, and the necessary action was taken, including the installation of additional dilution tanks and the recovery of chemicals before discharge to the drainage. ASHPITS Although dustbins and larger moveable containers for blocks of flats have been the accepted method of storing house refuse for many years, there still remain in the Borough a number of ashpits which are most unsuitable, and should be demolished. During the year further conversions to moveable containers have been carried out. There now remains the hard core of ashpits, and to change these will involve large structural alterations, and the loss of housing accommodation. SCHOOLS Most of the schools in Southwark are old, and, by present standards, are badly designed, but the conditions where children are taught should at least keep pace with the improvement of their homes. A comprehensive survey of the sanitary conveniences, washing facilities, and arrangements for children's meals was carried out by the Public Health Inspectors, and as a result of negotiations with the London County Council, many improvements have already been carried out, and plans have been prepared for further work to be done. 20 FREE WASHING FACILITIES During the year it was decided to provide free washing facilities, with paper towels and liquid soap, in public conveniences in the Borough. Linen towels with tablet soap are still available for a small charge. STAIRCASE LIGHTING Pursuant to section 63 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1956, the Council made byelaws for the adequate artificial lighting of common staircases in tenement houses and flats. These require the owners of such properties to provide and maintain artificial lighting by gas or electricity from half an hour before sunset until midnight; for one hour before sunrise from October to March; and otherwise when necessary if natural lighting is inadequate. At the end of the year confirmation by the Minister was awaited. ELEPHANT AND CASTLE SCHEME The reconstruction works now in progress in connection with the Elephant and Castle Scheme are affording an opportunity to seal off disused connections at the sewers from the drainage of buildings demolished by enemy action. A comprehensive survey is in hand and at the end of the year thirteen disused drains had been sealed off. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION (Smoke Abatement Officer — Mr. G. Stubbs) It is pleasing to record that this year the figures for sulphur dioxide and smoke, as recorded on the Council's instruments, show an improvement, and also the deposited matter in the residential area of the Borough was appreciably lower. The figures of deposits in the industrial area around Bankside, however, show an increase; this may be due to the use of the old Bankside Generating Station during periods of peak demands for electricity in the winter months. The coming into force of certain sections of the Clean Air Act, 1956, enabled the problem of domestic smoke to be tackled. The preliminary work on a proposed Smoke Control area was carried out and a report on the scheme was submitted to the Public Health Committee for approval. The area in question is mainly residential and is bounded by Walworth Road, Trafalgar Street, Dawes Street, Westmoreland Road, covering 36.5 acres. From the results of a 15% inspection of properties in the area, it was calculated that there are 1,285 separate dwellings, 52 shops 21 and public houses, one school, one clinic, one church, one church hall, seven factories and one workplace. Assuming an average consumption of 30 cwts. of coal per dwelling per year, a total of approximately 2,000 tons of coal per annum would need to be replaced by smokeless fuels. It was estimated that the majority of dwellings would require the installation of a modern approved appliance with gas connection. No adaptation of appliances in bedrooms was considered except in special circumstances. It was estimated that the total cost of adaptation and conversion in the proposed area would amount to £14,000, seven-tenths of this amount would be paid by the Council (the Exchequer repaying four-tenths), and the remaining three-tenths would be paid by the owner or occupier. This would mean the Borough Council being responsible for £4,200, the Exchequer £5,600, and the owners or occupiers, £4,200. In visiting the houses, and after explaining what the scheme would involve, it was found that the great majority of people welcomed the suggestion of the installation of a modern heating appliance, and approved the principle of a smoke control area. It is intended that when approval of the scheme is received from the Minister, a Publicity Campaign will be undertaken so that owners and occupiers in the area, and the public in general are aware of the requirements of the Order, and can readily obtain information and assistance from the Borough Council. Our representatives attended a meeting of South London Authorities at Deptford Town Hall—there was a general discussion and a resolution was passed welcoming the Clean Air Act and agreeing that the fullest co-operation and exchange of information between the 3oroughs was desirable. In order that firms who are proposing to construct buildings in the Borough are made aware of the new requirement that notification has to be given to the Council of the installation of new furnaces or additions to existing furnaces, it is our practice to send an explanatory letter with application form to the architects or other persons concerned. If plans and specifications are submitted to, and approved by the Council, the furnace is deemed to be as far as practicable, smokeless. During the year eight notifications were received and plans and specifications in respect of one installation were submitted and approval was given. Letters have been sent to all builders and large property owners in the 3oroug'n urging them to install approved appliances when replacing old-fashioned firegrates. Several firms replied and expressed their intention to co-operate, and it is hoped that it will become the general practice to install approved appliances. The Council has in use two Standard Deposit Gauges, three Lead Peroxide Instruments and one Smoke and Volumetric SulphurDioxide apparatus. 22 SULPHUR DIOXIDE (Lead Peroxide Method) (mgm SO 3/sq. cm./day) Mean Daily Concentration of SULPHUR DIOXIDE Parts per SMOKE 100 million mgms/m3 1957 Walworth Road St. George's Bankside Walworth Road January 4.4 2.9 5.0 19.8 0.63 February 4.7 3.5 6.2 10.6 0.46 March 3.8 2.6 5.0 10.4 0.32 April 3.3 2.1 3.1 6.3 0.26 May 2.2 1.4 2.9 4.6 0.19 June 1.6 1.0 1.7 5.0 0.19 July 1.9 1.2 2.1 3.7 0.18 August 2.2 1.1 2.1 4.5 0.17 September 2.4 1.5 2.4 4.6 0.23 October 3.7 2.5 4.6 11.4 0.36 November 5.0 3.4 5.0 12.0 0.39 December 5.8 4.0 6.4 19.2 0.48 Deposited matter at following sites BANKSIDE WALWORTH ROAD GREENMORE WHARF BANKSIDE JETTY 1957 (Recorded by Borough Council) (Recorded by Central Electricity Authority) TONS PER SQUARE MILE January 26.0 18.7 26.7 22.9 February 30.1 18.1 29.3 22.1 March 34.2 18.4 41.7 21.2 April 14.9 13.0 14.2 9.6 May 26.3 11.6 - - June 25.9 15.6 19.1 9.6 July 24.0 18.8 27.7 10.8 August 20.2 15.6 21.3 11.7 September 22.6 17.3 18.8 10.6 October 22.2 18.7 23.0 22.7 November 34.8 24.3 44.9 18.2 December 51.3 23.5 69.4 30.9 During the year 17 complaints were received regarding smoke emissions: 261 observations and inspections were made by the Inspector and 14 Intimation Notices issued.

As and when necessary, consignments have been held, in collaboration with the owners, and in a number of cases official detentions have been made, in accordance with the regulations. The egg products which have been dealt with this year were mainly from China, Australia, Holland and Germany. Those consignments which had been subjected to pasteurisation have proved to be most satisfactory. The products consisted mainly of crystal albumen, frozen whole egg, albumen and yolk, and spray dried powder. Infected batches have been released for pasteurisation, and high temperature baking. All crystal albumen imported from China has been heat treated in the two special plants in the Borough in accordance with the approved procedure, the results of which have been most satisfactory. A consignment of Canned Peruvian Tuna Fish, comprising 1,000 cartons each 48 x 8 oz. tins was detained pending a 100% examination. Bacteriological results showed that the contents of all blown tins were infected with haemolytic Clostridium welchii, probably due to under-processing. 54 cases and 39 tins were destroyed and the remainder released for human consumption. A consignment comprising 202 lambs imported from New Zealand was found to be contaminated by river water and detained pending bacteriological examination. 158 lambs were found to be unfit for human consumption and the remainder released for manufacturing purposes. 30 MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT, 1926 At the time of inspection of foodstuffs on importation, and in shops and on street stalls, attention has been given to the requirements relating to Indication of Origin. Most products to which the Act applies, including meat, oat products, and dried fruit appear to have been satisfactorily marked. There have been numerous occasions when the vendors have had to be requested to indicate the origin of tomatoes and apples, but legal proceedings have not been necessary. UNSOUND FOOD During the year 111 tons 13 cwts. 3 qtrs. 27 lbs. of food examined at wharves, warehouses and shops were found unfit for human consumption and disposed of as follows:— Food condemned at wharves and warehouses Destroyed : Tons Cwts.

Most of the dealers sell pre-packed ice-cream, obtained from the large manufacturers. 50 samples of ice-cream were taken with the following results:— 26 samples, Grade I. 10 samples, Grade II. 7 samples, Grade III. 7 samples. Grade IV. In addition : 28 samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition, and all were found to be satisfactory. 32 Periodical inspections were made to all premises. Copies of the public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. In the case of Grade III and IV samples, special investigations were made at the premises in an effort to detect the causes of the unsatisfactory gradings. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955: SECTION 16. Ice-Cream Registration — Refusal An application for the registration of premises for the purpose of Sale and Storage of Ice-Cream was refused by reason of there being (a) No supply of water sufficient in quantity to enable the provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 to be complied with. (b) No wash hand basin with a hot and cold water supply, both of which are required in order that the premises may comply with Regulations 15 and 16 respectively of the said Regulations. DESIGNATED MILK The following Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1954 and Milk (Special Designation)(Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk)Regulations, 1949 to 1953 153 Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 175 Dealers' Licences for Sterilised Milk. 114 Dealers' Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Thirty seven samples of Designated Milks were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. One sample of Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) and one of Pasteurised failed to satisfy the prescribed Methylene 31ue test, but further samples obtained from the same sources proved to be satisfactory. MILK SELLERS At the close of the year there were 156 registered milk distributors in the Borough, whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the Borough from registered premises elsewhere was 20. 309 inspections of Milkshops and Dairies were made during the year. 33 PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS Eight samples of condensed milk were purchased for analysis under the above regulations. They were all certified by the Public Analyst to comply with the regulations. BAKEHOUSES At the end of the year there were 17 3akehouses in use in Southwark, of which 3 were Basement 3akehouses. Thirty five inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors. SLAUGHTERHOUSES There are now no slaughterhouses in the Borough. CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 417 catering establishments in the Borough. These include riverside snack bars, cafes, coffee stalls, mobile snack bars, public house restaurants, and industrial canteens. All have received systematic inspection and close supervision during the year, and a satisfactory standard has been maintained. REGISTRATION OF FOOD PREMISES (Food and Drugs Act, 1955) There are now 85 premises registered for the purpose of the Preparation or Manufacture of Sausages or Potted, Pressed, Pickled or Preserved Food intended for Sale. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 - CASUAL STREET TRADING The Food Hygiene Regulations provide that food stalls shall bear conspicuously the name and address of the person carrying on the business; shall be kept clean, in good repair and condition, and properly lighted; and, if used for the sale of open food for immediate consumption, shall be supplied with hot water and washing facilities. There is, however, considerable difficulty in maintaining supervision over casual unlicenced street traders selling foodstuffs at week-ends, and the Metropolitan 3oroughs' Standing Joint Committee felt that better control could be exercised if regulations were made under the Food and Drugs Act, 34 1955 providing for the issue by local authorities of licences for the use of vehicles, stalls and places other than premises for the preparation or sale of food for human consumption and prohibiting the use of any such vehicles, etc. except in accordance with such a licence. Whilst the problem does not appear to be a serious one in Southwark, the Council informed the Standing Joint Committee that regulations under Section21 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, as suggested, would be advantageous.

There are 61 names of persons on the Council's list of Sellers of Part II Poisons. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT Compulsory Removals.

Burial of the Dead. During the year the Council arranged for sixteen burials under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, at a total cost of Q72.10.0d. WELFARE OF THE AGED In her Annual Report, Miss D. Beer, A.I.S.W., Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee, observed that the only way to prevent the problem of the care of the aged from becoming too much of a social and financial burden 38 to the country is to bring toold people new interests and activities. Social visits are increasingly necessary as more old people are now living alone and have outlived their friends and become separated from their families—who have their own domestic responsibilities or have moved away from the district. During the year 954 cases were referred to the Organisation and apart from the normal welfare services, a wide scope of personal problems was dealt with, as set out in the following list :— Meals-on-Wheels service Chiropody Service Convalescence and holidays Surgical equipment Transport and Escorts Pensions and other Financial questions Lost documents and other questions relating to Policies Legal matters Help with removals For radio sets Moving dangerous meters Clothing and bedding Hospital visiting Illness and Accidents Letter writing Occupational Therapy Chimney Sweeping Housing and Homes Cleansing Fuel Furniture Employment Social Interest Domestic Quarrels Care of Pets Friendly visits General care Travelling Library Religious and Consolation 54,447 meals were served in the restaurant at The Gatehouse, the two luncheon clubs at the Women's University Settlement and the hall of the Church of Lady Margaret and by the Meals on Wheels Service. It was found in some cases that the latter tended to discourage some old people from making an effort to help themselves and for this reason, each recipient is now visited after a six weeks' period to assess whether they are able to do their own cooking, or could go out to the restaurant. There is already evidence that this has helped in the rehabilitation of many patients after hospital treatment. Still of paramount importance is the Chiropody Clinic and whilst the Domiciliary Service which was commenced last year has proved a great success, the acquisition during this year of a car has enabled many of these patients to be taken to the Foot Clinic where they can meet their friends. This transport has also been invaluable in conveying old people to sick relations in hospital, visits to dentists or opticians, or short journeys for the housebound. 116 old people enjoyed a fortnight's holiday at Bexhill-on-Sea in lay and other outings have been arranged, many of them through the generosity of the Rotary Club. The development of these social activities is due to theenthusiasm of many willing voluntary helpers, and is restricted only by lack of funds, which were helped by a Flag Day and the Dickens Fair. 39 MORTUARY Post-mortems without Inquest 853 Post-mortems with Inquest 156 Inquests without Post-mortems - Inquests, Post-mortems held elsewhere - Bodies brought in for convenience 1 Infectious disease deaths - 1,010
