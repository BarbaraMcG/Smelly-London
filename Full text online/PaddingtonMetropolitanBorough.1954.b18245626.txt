Vital Statistics There has been no marked variation in the birth rate 17.44 (17.02) but there was a reduction in the death rate 9.67 (12.63) occasioned mainly by the reduction in the number of deaths from malignant disease 286 (542). There has been a reduction both in the incidence 195 (247) and in the deaths 16 (24) from pulmonary tuberculosis. The incidence of infectious disease in the Borough has again been low. Staffing In common with most districts in the country, Paddington has throughout the year been below the establishment of Sanitary Inspectors. On the 31st December your Public Health Department was three below the permitted establishment of eighteen. During the year four Sanitary Inspectors left to take up other appointments and one Sanitary Inspector was appointed. The Establishment Committee agreed to appoint four Area Inspectors, responsible to me for the work of the Sanitary Inspectors in their respective areas. Four of the senior inspectors were promoted after interview by the Establishment Committee (viz. Messrs. Atkins, Mains, Ronchetti and Wilde) and graded APT VII for the additional responsibility. This arrangement has been in operation since 1st April, 1954, and has increased the efficiency of the service to the public, and also helped considerably to expedite the administration of the department. During the year two temporary Student Sanitary Inspectors were appointed with the intention of facilitating recruitment to the department. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 It was generally anticipated that when this Act came into operation on 31st August, 1954 the time of your Sanitary Inspectors would be almost entirely occupied by inspections prior to the granting of the appropriate certificate. As events proved, however, by the end of the year only 51 applications for certificates had been received, and 42 had been granted. With regard to the provisions as to clearance and redevelopment, and reconditioning of unfit houses, Section 1 requires every local authority within one year after the commencement of this Act to submit to the Minister of Housing and Local Government proposals for dealing with houses which appear to the local authority to be unfit for human habitation, and with any other houses in its area which are, or in the opinion of the local authority ought to be, included in clearance areas. Preliminary surveys have taken place and in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Minister proposals and plans will be discussed with the London County Council before joint submission to the Minister. Sections 11 and 12 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 are of consequence in so far as they supersede the provisions of the Housing Act, 1936 and the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 to make and enforce bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings. A general power is now given to local authorities to require in houses which are in multiple occupation " a simple code of amenities " viz. an adequate provision of natural lighting, ventilation, water supply, sanitary conveniences, facilities for storage, preparation and cooking of food and prevention of overcrowding. It should be noted that the Minister considers that the amenities required should be considered in respect of each case separately. Inspection of Food and Food Premises I would like to draw particular attention to the work of your two Food Inspectors. During the year no less than 802 visits were paid by them to restaurants and cafes, and 6,004 visits to other food shops. In addition 600 food and drug samples were submitted to the Public Analyst. These figures in themselves indicate the care and'attention which is directed to the protection of the food supplies in the Borough. In accordance with Section 154 of the Factories Act, 1937 I recommended the Council to authorise the renewal of certificates of suitability for a further period of five years in respect of four underground bakehouses. At the previous quinquennial inspection 19 underground bakehouses had been granted certificates. 4 Every endeavour is made to assist managements to maintain a satisfactory standard in their bakeries and foodshops. Unfortunately it was found necessary to recommend proceedings against a person in control of a bakehouse in the Borough for the purpose of securing compliance with the requirements of Section 13 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. The wrapping of sweetmeats by registered outworkers was investigated by your food inspectors during the year. In July there were 40 persons registered who were engaged on this work in their own homes. Whilst it is true that they were kept under observation by the Council's Sanitary Inspector I reported that in my opinion the procedure was objectionable, as, although before registration the Sanitary Inspector concerned satisfied herself that the home conditions were reasonable, nevertheless there could be no guarantee as to what other members of the family and neighbours assisted—maybe with unclean hands. This problem was considered in 1950 by the Ministries of Health and Food, who at that time were unwilling to promote legislation prohibiting this practice, as they understood it was an infrequent one; that it would be difficult to prove that disease had been spread thereby; and that it had been suggested that the new Food Hygiene Regulations might prohibit the manufacture, storage or wrapping of food in rooms used as domestic living rooms. In view of the position outlined above it was decided to draw the attention of the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee to this matter and ask them to give full support to the inclusion of necessary powers in the proposed Food Hygiene Regulations prohibiting this objectionable practice in terms of the suggestion referred to above. Elderly People During the year the Department extended its services for the benefit of the old people of the Borough. Under powers conferred by Section 43 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953 a service for the cleansing and bathing of old people at home was started. Some eight to ten baths were given each week by the Medicinal Baths attendants. The Council also started, in September, 1954, a laundry scheme for the elderly incontinent. A washing machine was installed at the Medicinal Baths and the laundry done by the female baths attendant. Collection and delivery of the laundry was made by the disinfection staff. The majority of the cases dealt with were referred to the Department by the District Nurses, although some came to light during the visits of the Department's Female Sanitary Inspector and Visitor. From the inception of the scheme until the end of the year, eleven cases were dealt with, although at any one time the maximum number receiving attention was eight. This service is provided under Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. I have included an extract from a report of the Old People's Welfare Committee. Coloured Immigrants Throughout the year there has been an influx of coloured immigrants into the Borough, particularly in respect of British nationals from the West Indies. In so far as Paddington is the most densely populated of the Metropolitan Boroughs this immigration has given rise on many occasions to overcrowding and other allied social problems. Your Sanitary Inspectors have made numerous visits in response to complaints which have reached this Department in this connection. It was due to the tact and patience of your Sanitary Inspectors, coupled with the help and forebearance of the Paddington residents and the coloured British immigrants, that many of these problems were solved. In conclusion may I express my gratitude for the help and co-operation I have received from 'the Public Health Committee, the Chief Officers of the Council, and especially to all the staff of the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient seivant, Medical Officer of Health. 5 PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (at 31st December, 1954).— Mrs. E. G. Lane (Chairman) Mr. F. H.

The results obtained during 1954 are set out below! Month Rainfall in mms. Insoluble deposits in tons per square mile Soluble deposits in tons per square mile S.03 in mgs. per day per 100 square cms. January 22 8.93 10.61 4.38 February 51 1262 11.88 4.26 March 48 12.21 973 2.97 April 4 6.46 4.53 2.64 May 45 11.91 5.71 1.87 June 88 6.61 11.28 1.01 July 69 6.84 13.06 0.98 August 85 7.58 10.81 1.23 September 38 6.07 6.38 1.05 October 50 7.48 9.53 1.81 November 88 10.07 15.76 3.49 December 43 7.05 12.05 1.94 The apparatus used is in two parts. A deposit gauge by which the bye-products of combustion such as ash and grit in the atmosphere are measured and a lead peroxide instrument by which the amount of sulphur dioxide is measured. These instruments give monthly figures which, though useful, do not record the considerable fluctuation in pollution that occurs from hour to hour and from day to day. It is therefore proposed to instal a smoke recorder in a suitable position in the Borough. This instrument consists of an electrically operated air pump which continually aspirates a measured quantity of air through a filter paper. The smoke in the air produces a dark stain on the filter paper. Once a day or at other intervals as the atmospheric conditions require the filter paper is changed and the "shade value" of the stain is assessed by comparing it visually with a standard stain gauge. The smoke concentration in the air is calculated from the shade value of the stain and the quantity of air passed through the filter. The Council made a grant of £5 5s. 0d. to the National Smoke Abatement Society. Smoke nuisances were reported from four (2) premises during the year. In two cases no nuisance was found and in the other two cases the complaint was remedied without statutory action.

CANAL BOATS.—During the year the Paddington Basin and its vicinity were visited on 40 (38) occasions and 36 (22) boats were inspected. It was not necessary to serve any formal notices, the defects found being remedied by the owners upon the receipt of a letter. One (1) child of school age was found to be living on the boats inspected. BURIALS.—During the year 26 (36) burials and 6 (2) cremations were arranged under the National Assistance Act, 1948.

MORTUARY.—The number of bodies received at the mortuary was 392 (395) and 343 (339) post mortem examinations, were made there. PET ANIMALS ACT.—Seven (7) licences were applied for and granted during the year. Routine inspections are made to ensure that the conditions attaching to the licences are being maintained. RODENT CONTROL.—The following table gives details of the work carried out under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. It relates to the year ended 31st March 1955 at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 13 Dwelling Houses All other Property Total Total number of properties in district 24,255 (23,581) 4,686 ( 4,683) 28,941 (28,264) Number of properties inspected as a result of— (а) Notifications 295 (817) 105 (228) 400 (1,045) (b) Otherwise 405 (87) 85 (30) 490 (117) Number of properties found to be infested by rats— (a) Major infestation 2 (—) 4 (2) 6 (2) (b) Minor infestation 191 (240) 41 (92) j 232 (332) Number of properties found to be infested by mice 177 (218) 42 (62) 219 (280) Number of infested properties treated by Council 370 (458) 86 (156) 456 (614) In was not found necessary to serve any notices. Five (8) "block control" schemes were carried out. The sewers in the Borough received two treatments, in January and June. A further fifty trays were fixed in the sewers to facilitate baiting. Towards the end of the year a survey was made of the drainage system of the Queens Park Estate in conjunction with the estate owners . The general drainage lay-out of the Estate is that individual houses are drained into private sewers which run down the back gardens of houses and thence into the public sewers. The survey included all business premises on the Estate as well as private dwellings. Some statistical information about this survey is given below. Number of premises visited 2,048 Number of visits made 2,437 Number of houses infested nil Number of manholes baited 104 Number of manholes infested and treated 59 These figures are not included in the table given above. PIGEONS.—Three (1) complaints were received. The complainants were advised on preventive measures by the Sanitary Inspector and referred to the pigeon catcher authorised to operate in the Borough. RAG FLOCK ACT.—Five (5) premises where filling material was being used were on the register at the end of the year. There are no premises in the Borough where rag flock is manufactured or stored. Five (11) samples were taken, all of which were satisfactory. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACTS.—At the end of the year the Register contained the names of 115 (113) persons entitled to sell the poisons scheduled in Part II of the Poisons List. DRAINAGE RECONSTRUCTION PLANS.—During the year 228 (260) plans were deposited for drainage work in existing buildings. Three prosecutions are reported under "Legal proceedings." COMMON LODGING HOUSES.—There is one common lodging house in the Borough—a Cecil House—which provides sixty-six beds for women. WATER SUPPLY.—All drinking water in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains and has been satisfactory. No (1) water supply certificates were issued under the Public Health (London) Act 1936. BAKEHOUSES.—The quinquennial inspection of underground bakehouses required by the Factories Act 1937 in connection with the issue of Certificates of Suitability was carried out during 1954. Four out of the five existing underground bakehouses had their Certificates renewed. There are 19 (18) " level " bakehouses in the Borough. During the year 219 (147) inspections were made. One prosecution regarding the cleanliness of a bakery is reported under " Legal Proceedings." LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT 1954. —This Act contains two provisions which affect the work of the Public Health Department. The first is contained in Part IV of the Act which makes provision for the supplying of dustbins by the Council if they so desire ; and also provides that the Council may serve notices regarding insufficient dustbin accomodation on the owner and not, as under the Public Health (London) Act 1936, on the owner or occupier. The second is contained in Section 18 of the Act which provides for the registration of hairdressers and 14 barbers and gives the Council the power to make bye-laws for ensuring the cleanliness of premises and equipment, the persons employed and their clothing. At the end of the year, in order to obtain uniformity throughout the County, the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee were drafting bye-laws for adoption by the member Councils. SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS (AMENDMENT) ACT 1954.—This Act amends the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933. It provides for the Minister to make regulations for securing humane conditions in slaughterhouses, and also amends the terms under which slaughtermen's licences may be issued. A licence is now valid for one year only and must specify the kinds of animals to be slaughtered and the types of instruments which may be used. A licence to slaughter horses is operative only in the area of the authority issuing the licence. No licence was issued during 1954. FOOD SUPERVISION.— Unsound food.—Approximately 11½ (11¾) tons of diseased or unsound food were surrendered for destruction. Diseased meat is incinerated, other condemned food being disposed of through the normal refuse channels. Bacteriological examinations.—The samples of milk submitted, 147 (120) were all satisfactory. Samples of ice cream examined for bacterial content were graded as follows :— Grade 1—8(5): Grade 2—5(4): Grade 3—2(4): Grade 4—1(7). Other samples examined were lollies, drinking water, chocolate, and tinned cream, milk, salmon, ox-tongue and asparagus. Registrations.—The following registrations were in force at the end of the year under the Milk and Dairies Regulations or the Food and Drugs Acts :— Distributors of milk 117 (118) Dairies — (—) Ice cream premises 206 (195) Food premises 75 (75) Licences.—Licences to sell designated milk in force at the end of the year are given below:— Dealers' principal licences Dealers' supplementary licences Pasteurised 84 (78) Pasteurised 20 (20) Sterilised 121 (117) Sterilised 22 (22) Tuberculin tested 62 (60) Tuberculin tested 20 (20) Food poisoning.—During the year 89 (107) cases of food poisoning or suspected food poisoning were notified. An outbreak occurred in a local hospital which affected seventeen people. The causative agent was salmonella typhimurium, phage type II, and the suspected food was fried liver. In addition to the seventeen cases mentioned the causative agent was found to be salmonella typhimurium in nine other cases. Two further cases were caused by streptococcal infections and in the remaining sixty-one cases no agent was found. Food premises.—Following are details of the food premises in the Borough at the end of the year:— Food Shops Bakers 21 (25) Provision stores 123 (122) Cake shops 22 (20) Horsemeat shops 2 (2) Butchers 60 (60) Domestic stores 17 (17) Confectioners 112 (107) Corn chandlers 2 (2) Chemists 51 (51) Greengrocers 93 (93) Fishmongers 21 (24) Public Houses 105 (105) Fried fish shops 12 (12) Cider Houses 2 (2) Grocers 40 (41) Off Licences 57 (57) General shops 41 (43) Cafes, restaurants etc 141 (143) Food Factories There are 10 (10) food factories in the Borough including 2 (2) ice cream factories. Animal Food Dealers There are two cats' meat shops in the Borough. This is the same figure as last year. Street Traders Coffee stalls 6 (6) Fruit and vegetable stalls 31 (31) Ice cream stalls 2 (2). 15 Sampling.—During the year 600 (600) samples were submitted to the Public Analyst. All were found to be genuine except four informal samples. Three of these samples were of bread and butter from cafes in the Borough in which the "butter" was a mixture of butter and margarine. The proportion of margarine in the three samples was 60 per cent, 30 per cent. and 40 per cent. respectively. Warnings were given in each case to the people concerned. The fourth sample was of sausages, which contained a slight amount of sulphite preservative above the permitted amount. The action to be taken in this case will depend on the results of the analysis of a formal sample which will be taken when the sausages are again on sale here. Inspections.—During the year the two Food Inspectors paid 802 (636) visits to restaurants and cafes and 6,004 (5,312) visits to other food shops. AGED AND INFIRM PERSONS General.—There are 129 (134) current cases on the records of the Department of which 72 (63) were brought to notice during 1954. All new cases are visited and if there is any assistance which can be usefully given by statutory or voluntary bodies such as the County Council Home Help Service, District Nurses or National Assistance Board this is arranged. Regular visits are paid to all cases on the current list to keep in touch with any change in the circumstances. Relatives are informed if it is thought that they can help. The women visitors made 1,622 (555) visits during the year and the male inspectors 48 (20). National Assistance Acts.—\t was not found necessary to apply to the Courts for a compulsory removal order in any case referred to the Department. Holiday Home.—During the year 979 (893) applications for a holiday were received and 642 (583) guests were accommodated. Two hundred and forty-six applicants refused the holiday offered (mainly on account of illness or because the dates allocated were too early or too late). In the remaining 91 cases no allocations were made due to death, removal from the Borough, unfitness, or to single rooms or specified dates not being available. Home bathing.-—The bathing at home of the bed-ridden which was commenced towards the end of 1953 continued during the year. This work is done by the female attendant from the Medicinal Baths and 406 baths were given. Laundry service.—In June the Council adopted a scheme for laundering the bed linen of incontinent elderly persons and the service commenced in September. The number of cases being dealt with at the end of the year was eight. Each case is certified under section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act 1936 and the number of certificates issued during the year was eleven. OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE. The following notes have been extracted from the Annual Report of the Committee which covers the year ending 31st March, 1955. Housing Association:—A Paddington Old People's Housing Association was formed in April. The initial costs were met from the Committee's funds and a grant of £500 made. Visiting:—The visiting of the housebound by voluntary visitors has continued. Chiropody:—The service continues to be in great demand, 779 treatments were given at the clinic and 82 housebound people were visited. Harvest Gift Celebrations:—The proceeds from three schools were offered to the Committee and about 100 old folk attended the services. Each received a gift of fruit and groceries and a further eighty parcels were delivered to the bed-ridden and hospital patients. Alexandra Rose Day:—A depot was again organised and £30 was received form the Alexandra Rose Day Funds. Flag Day:—The flag day activities raised £165 for the funds of the Welfare Committee. Holidays:—The Amersham Townswomen's Guild arranged a day's outing for 30 old people; recuperative and private holidays were arranged for 25 people. Homes:—Twenty five old people were helped to enter private or London County Council Homes. Christmas Parties:—One party went to an Ice Show. Two hundred and fifty old people accepted the invitation to the Rotarians' Christmas Party which was again a great success. The car service provided by the Rotarians enabled many crippled folk to attend. Christmas dinners:—On Christmas Eve 144 "frozen" dinners (towards which the Paddington Rotary Club made a generous donation) were delivered by Paddington Girl Guides. 16 Food Parcels:—Nearly a thousand food parcels from America were received and distributed in January. Meals for the Elderly:—The gap left by the closing of the London County Council Restaurants was filled by the Salvation Army opening its own kitchen and by the Women's Voluntary Service collecting meals from the Kensington Communal Kitchen. Employment Scheme:—With the example of Finsbury before it, an employment scheme for the elderly was started in March. The Salvation Army generously allowed their hall to be used on two afternoons a week and fourteen people are employed but the need for permanent premises is pressing. A waiting list of old folk anxious to join has been started and sufficient work for all has been promised by employers. Whist Drives :—Whist drives were again held regularly during the year to raise funds for the Committee's work. The year has been one of consolidation and expansion for the Committee, made possible by the improved financial position. Many more elderly folk are seeking advice and help and the problems are many and varied, but housing headsthe list. HEALTH EDUCATION. The CLEAN FOOD CAMPAIGN in the Borough has continued on the same lines as in the previous year. Food handlers are interviewed, encouraged and advised on every possible occasion—during the year the food inspectors paid 802 visits to cafes and restaurants and 6,004 visits to other food premises. Posters are exhibited and pamphlets distributed for the instruction of the public. Voluntary SMALLPOX VACCINATION and DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION has been maintained by the personal approach to the mothers by the London County Council's Health Visitors. The MASS X-RAY UNIT carried out a survey from the Welfare Centre, 283a Harrow Road, from the 1st to the 14th January 1954. This survey was not confined to Paddington residents. Local employers, including the Council, were encouraged to allow their staffs to attend as well as private individuals. The number of people x-rayed was 3,485 made up of 2,156 men and 1,329 women. Of this total 18 persons were referred to the Chest Clinic as a result of the survey. The Liaison Officer of the Unit tells me that he was rather disappointed with the low attendance. The efficient arrangements for taking the films are, however, always commented on by those who do attend. VENEREAL DISEASE notices giving the facilities for treatment are permanently exhibited and special posters are displayed when requested by the London County Council. The Council made a grant of £10 10s. 0d. to the CENTRAL COUNCIL FOR HEALTH EDUCATION in 1954. This Council publishes excellent pamphlets on health subjects which are sold at cost price to subscribers, and has exhibition stands available on loan. HOUSING. Houses unfit for human habitation. No of basement rooms dealt with by closing orders 37 (233) No. of houses dealt with by demolition orders or in respect of which undertakings were accepted 4 (2) Twelve (19) persons were displaced as a result of the Council's operations, five (18) being rehoused by the Paddington Borough Council, and seven (—) by the London County Council. Closing orders were determined or undertakings cancelled on ten (21) basements, the upper parts of three (2) mews premises, and one whole premises. Fifteen (22) other basements, the upper part of one mews premises, and two whole premises were made fit without recourse to formal proceedings. Compulsory Repairs. Fourteen (7) notices were served during the year under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936. Two (—) notices were complied with, and work was in progress at eight (5) of the premises. At four (1) premises nothing had been done. Of the ten (17) notices served prior to 1954 which remained outstanding five (12) were complied with by the owners, default action was taken by the Council in three (3) other cases, at one of which work was still in progress at the end of the year. At one (2) other premises work was in progress, and one notice was in abeyance, the premises being vacant and for sale. Housing Act, 1936—Overcrowding. (a) (1) No. of dwellings overcrowed at the end of the year 288 (327) (2) No. of families dwelling therein 296 (338) (3) No. of persons dwelling therein 1,217£ (1,369) units (b) No. of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 93 (87) 17 (c) (1) No. of cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 132 (155) (2) No. of persons concerned in such cases 522 (611) units (d) Particulars of any cases in which dwelling-houses have again become crowded after the Local Authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding NIL The number of overcrowded dwellings on the Register of Overcrowding at the end of 1954 (288) shows a decrease of 39 on the figure for 1953 (327). Some 90 of these were basement dwellings. Of the cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 11 (11) were provided with accommodation by the Borough Council, 54 (39) were rehoused by the London County Council, 39 (70) secured accommodation privately, 23 (34) were relieved by a natural reduction in the size of the family or on obtaining additional accommodation, and 5 (1) families were rehoused under the Industrial Selection Scheme for New Towns. The practice of sending warning letters to owners and landlords against permitting the premises to become again overcrowded has been continued in all known cases where overcrowidng of premises has been abated. In all, the London County Council rehoused 291 families from Paddington during the year, 54 of which were recommended for preferential treatment on overcrowding grounds. Housing Act, 1949—Improvements and conversions. Fifteen applications for grants in respect of proposed improvement or conversion of properties were referred to the Department for examination and report. The preparation of these reports involves consultation between the Sanitary Inspectors and other technical officers of the Council as well as interviews on the premises with the architects and owners concerned. Underground Room Regulations. The Minister of Housing and Local Government informed the Council on the 30th June 1954 that the model regulations for rooms to which Section 12 (2) of the Housing Act 1936 applied has been revised to bring them into line with the new model building bye-laws, to secure proper economy in the use of materials and to incorporate other improvements. On the 21st October 1954 the Council decided to adopt the revised model regulations (which were set out in full as an Appendix of the Council Agenda) in order to secure uniformity with adjacent Boroughs who were also adopting the regulations. The revised regulations were confirmed by the Minister on the 15th December, 1954. Town Planning. Ninety-eight applications to the London County Council under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 for the conversion and altering of premises, as well as a large number of applications for continuation of consent, were referred to the Council for examination and comment. As a result of the Council's observations permission was refused for certain basement rooms to be used for human habitation where the rooms did not conform to the statutes and regulations in force in the Borough. Housing Accommodation: Preferential Treatment. During the year 659 (521) medical certificates were referred to me by the Borough Director of Housing for "pointing" This arrangement enables the necessary degree of preference to be given to each certificate as well as bringing to notice sanitary defects which might otherwise have escaped detection and in respect of which no previous complaint had been received. Immigrants from Cyprus and Malta. The Governments of Cyprus and Malta continue to co-operate with the Council in ascertaining the suitability of accommodation offered to would-be immigrants by relatives and friends living in the Borough. In each case a visit is made by the Sanitary Inspector to the premises, and the Government concerned advised as to the adequacy and permanence of the proposed accommodation. This arrangement avoids overcrowding of premises and ensures that the immigrants are adequately housed. Land Charges Act, 1925. Under the above-mentioned Act it is incumbent on the local authority to keep a register of local land charges. Houses included in clearance, improvement and re-development areas must be registered, as well as houses subject to repair notices under Part II of the Housing Act, 1936, and houses on which closing or demolition orders have been made. Some 1,372 inquiries were referred to the Public Health Department during the year asking for details of notices outstanding and orders in operation under the Housing Act. At the same time particulars were called for of sanitary or other notices outstanding on the properties concerned. 18 Rehousing Enquiries. Some 600 (900) communications, were received during the year from the Borough Director of Housing, the CountyDivisional Medical Officer, the County Director of Housing and Valuer, and from other authorities, requesting information on the housing conditions of persons applying for rehousing on grounds of overcrowding, insanitary conditions, and ill-health. Such information enables the enquirer to assess the degree of priority to be given to the applicants concerned. In each case a visit was made by the Sanitary Inspector and a report furnished. New accommodation. During the year 22 fiats were completed at Taunton House, 16 at Philip Court, and 10 at Portnall House. The following is a list of Council-owned new accommodation:— Pre-war No. of flats Brindley House 8 Dudley House 50 Artesian House 8 Post-war Fleming Court 48 Queen's Park Court 96 John Aird Court 115 Lancefield Court 12 Philip Court 26 Post-war (cont.)

The Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, came into operation on the 30th August, 1954. Part I requires the local authority to submit to the Minister of Housing and Local Government within one year from the commencement of the Act proposals for dealing in one way or another with the houses in their area which appear to them to be unfit for human habitation and liable to demolition. The proposals are to be submitted in such form as the Minister may require. At the end of the year steady progress had been made with the preliminary work. Areas have been mapped out and it is hoped in the near future to submit details to the London County Council for approval. Part II of the Act enables increased rents to be charged subject to the premises being of a certain standard of fitness. If the rent of a property is increased and the fitness of the premises is below the standard, a certificate of disrepair can be issued which specifies the defects found. The increased rent is not then applicable until the certificate is revoked i.e. the defects are remedied. The following table gives particulars of these certificates. The figures given below relate to the period 30th August 1954 (the date of commencement of the Act) to 31st March, 1955, as requested by the Minister of Housing and Local Government.
