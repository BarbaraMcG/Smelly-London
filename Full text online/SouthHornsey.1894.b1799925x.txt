Surgeon to Metropolitan Police N and J Division. FOR THE YEAR 1894. Printed by W THOMPSON. ALLEN ROAD, SOUTH HORNSEY. Report for the Year 1894. Extent—This District comprises that portion of the Parish of Hornsey, in the County of Middlesex, which lies between the Seven Sisters Road and the High Street, Stoke Newington, having an area of 280 acres. It adopted the Local Government Act, and became an Urban Sanitary Authority in the year 1865 ; in which respect it preceded the remainder of the parish, which did not take this important step until 1867—two years later. Parks and Open Spaces.—This District is well provided for in the way of open spaces. Clissold Park, of which about 30 acres are situated in South Hornsey, is nearly central, and is of easy access to the whole of the inhabitants. To the acquisition of this Park in 1888, South Hornsey contributed £6,000, of which £5,720 is still owing. Finsbury Park, also in the Parish of Hornsey, although immediately beyond the boundary of the South Hornsey District, is also readily accessible from any portion of the District. Population and Rateable Value.—The population of the District, according to the census in 1891, was 16,092, and is now calculated to be 17,150. The density of the population is 74 to the acre : this by comparison with the other Urban Districts in Middlesex, appears to be high, and some have erroneously supposed that as a District, South Hornsey is overcrowded. This is not the case, but it is fully developed, there being no pastures or waste lands. That the District is not densely populated is seen at once by comparison with the adjoining Metropolitan District, Islington, where the density is 102 to the acre. The present rateable value is £90,154. Gas Supply.—The gas used in the District is supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company There are 247 public lamps in the District, which were lighted at the cost of £789 for the twelve months. The charge for gas to private consumers was reduced at the September quarter from 8/- to 2/10 per 1000 cubic feet. Water.—The water for street watering and house supply, Ac., is supplied by the New River Company: the amount used for the first purpose during the past year (1894) was 2,581,000 gallons, costing 8½d. per 1000 gallons, against 4,172,000 for 1893, 3,491,000 gallons used in 1892, and 2,657,080 gallons used in 1891. The water is supplied to private consumers according to assessment. Drainage.—The District is drained into the Metropolitan system, for which £1116 was paid to the London County Council during the year, being a pro rata contribution based upon the assessments of the contributory authorities, including the Metropolitan Vestries of London, the Local Boards for the Districts of South Hornsey, Hornsey, Beckenham, Tottenham, &c. 3 Fire Brigade.—During 1894 the Fire Brigade reoeived calls to fires as follows — Chimney Fires in District 15 House Fires in Distriot 6 False Alarms 6 Fires extinguished by Brigade in Metropolitan Area 9 Assisted at Fires in Metropolitan Area 2 Attended only at Fires „ 2 — 13 40 The total amount paid in wages for night firemen, and for maintenance etc., at the fire stations in Milton and Somerfield Eoads (not including the horsing of the engine) according to the last audited account, was £209. The Granite is supplied by contract at 16s. 3d. per cubic yard, the Flints at 7s. 9d., and the Hoggin at 5s. 6d. Dusting.—The dust and house refuse is removed by contract at an annual cost or £576. A system of weekly removol of the dust from houses is gradually being extended, so as, if possible, to include the whole District. In order to secure prompt removal of dust, particular attention should be given to page 16. The requests for removal received duriDg the year numbered Reg. 565, as against 997 in 1893, thus shewing a gradual improvement. Health.—Considering that South Hornsey is the most densely populated Urban Sanitary District in Middlesex (being 74 to the acre, the next being Tottenham with 23'7 to the acre) it can claim to be a very healthy district. The death rate was 1.18, being very nearly the lowest of any sanitary district in the United Kingdom. Infectious Disease.—During the year, the Board, as indicated in the last report, pressed forward with their negotiations to secure a suitable site for an Isolation Hospital; and with such success that, although the opposition they met with at an exhaustive enquiry held by the Local Government Board, was particularly strong, the Counoil are now in a position to announce that a Freehold site has been secured, thus far meeting what has, for some years past, been held to be the great want of the District. The Local Govebnment Act.—This year was marked by the the passing of Local Government Act, 1894, otherwise known as the " Parish Councils Act." Materials.—The following road materials were used during the last financial year— main roads. other roads. Granite 66½ 145 Flints — 881½ Hogein 611 93|¾ 4 By Beet 86.(2) enacted that" Where a parish is at the passing of this Act, situated in more than one Urban District, the parts of the parish in each such District shall, as from the appointed day, unless the County Council for special reasons, otherwise direct—be separated." The Hornsey and South Hornsey Local Boards being both Urban Districts, within the parish of Hornsey, the Middlesex County Council instituted a public enquiry at the Hornsey Local Board Offices, in Southwood Lane, Highgate, on May 28th, 1894. The Local Board on the 9th of May, 1894, had unanimously passed the following resolution— "That in the event of the Middlesex County Council being of opinion that special reasons exist why South Hornsey should not become a separate parish, then that this Board would acquiesce, and be content to remain within the parish of Hornsey as a separate District Council; but if that is to be followed by the absorption of this district into Hornsey, then that this Board would strongly protest against such a course ; and that the County Council be requested to exercise their jurisdiction to preserve Hornsey and South Hornsey as an entire parish while maintaining them as separate Urban authorities, such being not only the wish of the Board, but the ascertained desire of the inhabitants of the district." After the enquiry, the Local Board, on June 6th, 1894, unanimously resolved— "That in the opinion of this Board, the evidence adduced at the Enquiry held on the 28th May proved conclusively that absorption into Hornsey for sanitary purposes could not be effected without grave injustice to the inhabitants of South Hornsey, who have opposed and would strenuously oppose such amalgamation." "That the Board therefore re-affirm the resolution passed unanimously at their meeting on May 9th." The Middlesex County Council after consideration of the report of R. W. Harper, Esq., the Inspector appointed to hold the enquiry, resolved— "That special reasons exist why the Parish of Hornsey should remain partly in the District of the Hornsey Local Board and partly in the District of the South Hornsey Local Board, and that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Local Government Act 1894, the Parish of Hornsey shall not be divided, but shall continue to be within the Districts of the two Local Boards above referred to." "That an order, in a form to be approved of by the Clerk of the County Council, embodying the above and any other necessary provisions, be sealed in duplicate with the Common Seal of the County Council." Accordingly, this District remains a separate authority within the parish of Hornsey, and after an uncontested election in November, on Monday December 31st, 1894, the present Local Authority held its first meeting as the Urban District Council of South Hornsey. 5 Report of the Medical Officer. To the South Hornsey District Council. Gentlemen, The number of deaths registered in the District of South Hornsey during the year 1894 was 200, and consisted of 98 males and 102 females; this is equal to a deathrate of 11.6 per 1000 persons living in South Hornsey at the close of the year. I consider the population to be 17,170—of these 200 deaths from all causes 17 died in various institutions without the district. The Births during the year were 896, 212 of these were females and 184 males. The birth-rate for the year was 23.0 per 1000. The births exceeded the deaths by 196. The deaths therefore for the year 1894 were 26 less than in 1893. The births also were less, being 11 below that of 1893. In London the death-rate was 16.6 and in the outer ring 18.0 The birth-rate in London was 29.6 and in the outer ring 28.3 In the 200 deaths from all causes were included 27 from the Zymotic class of diseases 10 of which were from Diphtheria, 10 Croup, 5 Diarrhoea, 3 Whooping Cough, 2 Typhoid Fever. In the last quarter of the year only 4 deaths occurred from this class of disease. The Zymotic death-rate for the year was 13.5 per cent of the deaths and 1.5 to every 1000 persons living. The Zymotic death-rate in London for the year was 2.66 and in the outer ring 1.89. The number of Infants that died undor 1 year of age was 48, which is equal to a death-rate of 2.5 per 1000 and 11.0 per cent of the deaths; in 1893 the Infantile death-rate was 3.3 per 1000, or 14.7 per cent of the death-rate. 62 persons died at the age of 60 years and above, in the previous year they were 63. The number of Infectious diseases notified during 1894 was 86—42 or nearly half of these were cases of Diphtheria, 20 Scarlet Fever, and 8 Typhoid. Four of the latter were in December. I was unable to trace the origin of any of these cases, though two were attributed to eating oysters and the one case certainly appeared as though such might have been the case. The gentleman having taken oysters at a Restaurant with a friend living on the 6 other aide of London and both were seized with the disease on same day, and that 14 days after partaking of them. In the other case a gentleman was seized with it 18 or 14 days after a hearty meal of them and was greatly impressed with the idea that such was the cause of his attack. The negotiations with regard to the erection of an Infectious diseases hospital for this district are still being carried on and I have every reason to think permission will shortly be given and its erection commenced. I beg to call the particular attention of the Council to table No. 8 by which will be seen the amount of Sanitary work done during the year; 470 houses were inspected and the number of re-inspections after notice 900, letters written and circulars sent out 850. Personal notices served 79, Statutory ones 231. The Soil pipes of 48 Water Closets were taken outside and ventilated. It will also be seen that a considerable amount of other important work was accomplished during the year. I have great pleasure in pointing out to you that the health of the district of South Hornsey still maintains its position as one of the healthiest in and around London although it is the most densely populated Urban district in Middlesex. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, THOS. S. H. JACKMAN. 7 TABLE 1.
