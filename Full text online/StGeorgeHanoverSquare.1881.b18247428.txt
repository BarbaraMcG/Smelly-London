The Vestry learning that the two Wharves on the Grosvenor Canal, immediately adjoining the Wharf belonging to the Parish, were to be let, and feeling that it would be advisable, if they could be obtained on reasonable terms, to extend the system of cleansing and watering the roads of the Parish, by means of plant belonging to the Parish, to the whole Parish, entered into negociations to rent or purchase the Wharves. The Wharves were first offered on a 21 years' lease, at an annual rent of £750. The Vestry considered this to be a fair rent for the premises, but preferred to obtain, if possible, the original leases from the Duke of Westminster. They found the property was held under two leases, both expiring at Lady-day 1934, at ground rents amounting together to £155 16s. These leases were, after much negociation, purchased for the sum of £10,500; and the fixtures on the Wharves for the sum of £1,268 10s. The necessary additions to the plant, &c., were made by the Vestry, and on the 25th March, 1882, the cleansing and watering of the whole of the public roads of the Parish, by means of plant belonging to the Parish, were undertaken for the first time by the Vestry. The Vestry feel confident that this new arrangement will result in the Parish works being carried out in a much more efficient manner, and when the heavy first-cost charges for plant, &c., are paid off, they believe it will also result in economy to the Ratepayers. The loans raised to meet the outlays are as under:— For purchase of leases £10,500 For purchase of plant, &c. 5,000 £15,500 32 Authority has been obtained from the Metropolitan Board of Works to raise by loan, for the purchase of plant, a further sum of £2,455. For full Statement of Outstanding Loans, see page 136. The Vestry hope that hereafter arrangements may be made for the removal of the house refuse by Parish horses and carts to the Wharves, and from thence by barges. Trinity Chapel Site Charity. It was stated in the last Annual Report that the Judgment of Mr. Justice Fry in favour of this Parish in this suit was appealed against by the Authorities of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The appeal was heard before the Lords Justices on the 11th and 14th November, 1881, and was dismissed with costs. Their Lordships considered that the premises were no longer required for a chapel, and consequently added to the Judgment of the Court below a direction that a Scheme should be carried into Chambers for the administration of the Charity. This course will be very advantageous to all parties, as it will probably obviate the necessity and expense of an Act of Parliament. The Lords Justices also decided that the general public were not interested in the scheme, and added a Declaration that the Charity property is held for the benefit of the inhabitants of the ancient Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields as it existed in the year 1690, or some of them, and that such Declaration was to be without prejudice to the claim of St. George's, Hanover Square, to exclude the present Parish of St. Martin from the benefit of the Charity, or of the present Parish of St. Martin to participate therein. The Vestry have been in correspondence with the Authorities of St. Martin's Parish with a view to preventing further costs being incurred in hostile litigation. This has 33 resulted in an arrangement being come to on the following basis, viz.:— The costs of the appeal to be borne by the Appellants; all the other costs of suit, past and future, to be paid out of the fund in Court. The Estate to be managed by Trustees to be appointed on behalf of both Parishes (eight St. George's and two St. Martin's); and that the net income, after deducting head rents, fines, and expenses of management, be divided into five parts, whereof one shall go to St. Martin's and four to St. George's. This arrangement has been prepared in the form of a Scheme, and is now awaiting the approval of the Court of Chancery. It will be seen that the appropriation of the four-fifths share of St. George's Income has yet to be determined upon. Grosvenor Chapel. The Rev. R. S. Oldham having retired from the Incumbency of Grosvenor Chapel, the Rev. T. Foster Elliott, M.A., was appointed to succeed him. Danger of Inundation from High Tides. The several wharf owners have been called upon during the year by the Metropolitan Board of Works, to raise the river walls of their respective properties to a height considered by the Engineer of the Board to be sufficient to prevent inundation from the River Thames. The Yestry believe that the whole of these necessary works have been carried out. They regret, however, to find that a portion of the river wall at the termination of the wharves, at a point nearly opposite the end of Ranelagh Road, which is under the care of H.M. Office of Works, has not been raised. c 34 Owing to the neglect of the Office of Works to raise this portion of wall, the works carried out by the wharf owners are rendered practically useless, as, were exceptionally high tides to occur the water would pass over the pathway at the spot mentioned, and from thence enter the wharves from the sides next the roadway, and, if the tide were sufficiently high, pass over the roadway and flood a large portion of the South Belgravia District. The Vestry understand that the Metropolitan Board of Works have from time to time requested H.M. Office of Works to give orders for the portion of river wall in question to be raised. Government property is exempted from the operation of the Metropolis Management (Thames River Prevention of Floods) Amendment Act, 1879; and the Metropolitan Board are therefore powerless to enforce the work, and have no authority to incur the expense of carrying it out. The Vestry have remonstrated ineffectually with H.M. Office of Works on the subject. They trust that their fears of inundation from this spot may not be realized. Proposed Alteration in the Government of London. The attention of the Vestry having been called to the expressed intention of the Government to bring before the House of Commons a Bill for the reform of the ancient and distinguished Corporation of London, and the extension of Municipal Government at large, the following resolution was unanimously passed on the subject, viz.:— That this Vestry desires to ensure efficient management and control over local affairs by local authorities, in any measure that may be introduced for the creation of a general governing body for the whole Metropolis. A copy of this resolution was communicated to the Home Secretary and each of the Metropolitan Yestries and District Boards of Works. 35 Market Accommodation. On the question of the establishment of Markets for the Metropolis, the Vestry passed the following resolution, viz.:— That the Vestry is of opinion that the Wholesale Markets of London should be provided and controlled by an Authority which represents the ratepayers of London. A copy of this resolution was forwarded to the Corporation of the City of London, the Metropolitan Board of Works, and each Vestry and District Board in the Metropolis. Westminster, Pimlico, Chelsea, and Fulham Tramways. Notices of an intended application to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order for powers to construct Tramways in Pimlico Road, Buckingham Palace Road, Stockbridge Terrace, Warwick Street, and Ebury Bridge in this Parish, were given in November 1880. The Yestry withheld their consent from the scheme, which soon became dropped by the Promoters. Mid Metropolitan Railway (Pneumatic System). Notices and plans of this scheme, for making an underground Railway down the centre of Oxford Street and through other parts of the Parish, were served on the Vestry in November 1880. After full consideration, the Vestry determined not to oppose the principle of the Bill, but to petition Parliament for Clauses to be inserted in the Bill for the proper protection of the Parish roads, streets, sewers, &c., and the ratepayers affected by the works. The Bill was introduced into Parliament, and the Petition of the Vestry duly presented, but it was not found necessary to take any further steps, as the Bill was, at an early stage, withdrawn. 36 Electric Lighting Bills. The Vestry learning that there were numerous Private Bills before Parliament in which the Promoters sought powers to supply the means of lighting by electricity, the Vestry passed the two following resolutions, which were communicated to the Metropolitan Board of Works, viz.:— That the Metropolitan Board of Works be asked to guard against the various Metropolitan schemes for supplying the means of lighting by electricity, resulting in the creation of a monopoly, such as has been the result with regard to the Metropolitan supply of gas and water; and to see That clauses are inserted in the various Bills for protecting the ratepayers with regard to the scale of charges for private and public lighting; and for the ultimate purchase at the option of the Metropolitan or Local Authorities, of the works of the Companies at a scale to be laid down in their Acts. London Riverside Fish Market Bill. This Bill for establishing a Fish Market in Shadwell was brought under the notice of the Vestry, and they petitioned in favour of it, in both the House of Commons and in the House of Lords, adding in the latter case a suggestion— That the control of the Market should ultimately be lodged with any Municipality that may be established for the Metropolis. The Bill has passed in an amended form. Infectious Diseases Notification Bill. A Bill, for making it compulsory on medical practitioners and others to send early notification to the Sanitary 37 rities of the occurrence of infectious diseases within their districts, having been introduced into Parliament, the Vestry, believing that the compulsory notification of the occurrence of infectious diseases would materially assist the Sanitary Authorities in their endeavours to prevent the spread of such diseases, petitioned Parliament in favour of the Bill. The Bill became dropped. Bill of Sales Act (1878) Amendment Bill. The Vestry asked the Members of Parliament to support Clause 13 of this Bill, which would render a bill of sale inoperative against a distress for poor and parochial rates. Such a provision would occasionally be of much assistance in the collection of the rates. The Bill was ultimately passed with the desired Clause retained therein. Charges of Water Companies. The Vestry unanimously passed the following resolution on this subject, viz.:— That this Vestry regret that owing to the passing of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, the charges made by the Metropolitan Water Companies for Water are continually being raised, while no additional benefit whatever is conferred upon consumers; and that the Government be urged to introduce a Bill during the ensuing Session restraining the Metropolitan Water Companies from taking advantage of the gross value as created by the above-mentioned Act, it never having been the intention of the Legislature that such gross value should be used for other than Imperial and Local purposes. A copy of the above resolution was forwarded to the Home Secretary and the Members of Parliament for Westminster. 38 Census. The following is a statement of the population of the Parish as appeared at the Census of April, 1871 and 1881; the statement for the latter year is incomplete ; the Vestry hope to get the full information in time for next year's Report:— Parochial Wards. 1871. 1881.

The orders for admission as in-patients or for treatment as out-patients in the Hospitals, are granted by an Order Committee, consisting of five Trustees, one member of the Committee being elected from each Parish interested. A new Scheme is to be obtained, if by the falling in of leases or otherwise the net income of the Charity shall exceed £1,000, or if at any time, from change of circumstances or otherwise, Her Majesty's Attorney-General should be of opinion that further arrangements are desirable.

IV., cap. exxi.), on the 21st May, 1862, resolved:— " That a book be provided, called the Samaritan Fund Book, in which the amount should be entered; that the money be kept in the Clerk's hands, and disposed of, from time to time, by this Board, the sums given being signed by the presiding Chairman of the day." Subsequently the Board further resolved:— " That a box be placed at the House in Mount-street, with the following inscription,—' Samaritan Fund of St. George, Hanover-square, for the Relief, by Gift, of such Poor Persons as the Poor Board cannot, by law, assist with Money and "That the Governors and Directors of the Poor, for the time being, constitute a Committee for the distribution of the Samaritan Fund." Upon the formation of St. George's Union, the Fund was handed over to Trustees, for the benefit of the poor of this Parish.

The old Granite pitching, or paving stones, removed from the channels and crossings of the streets in which Wood Pavement has been laid down, have been carted to the Depot of the Vestry, and subsequently utilized in relaying new crossings, channels, &c. Refuges. Refuges have been fixed during the past year at the following places, viz.:— In-Wards. jBerkeley Square, by Bruton Street. Bond Street, by Conduit Street. Park Lane, by Stanhope Gate. Bond Street, by Oxford Street. Hanover Square, by Hanover Square Club. Piccadilly, by Down Street. Berkeley Square, by Mount Street. Out-Wards. Elizabeth Bridge, by Buckingham Palace Road. JEccleston Bridge, by Buckingham Palace Road. Stockbridge Terrace, opposite entrance to Metropolitan District Railway Station. Q-rosvenor Grardens, opposite Grosvenor Hotel. Stockbridge Terrace, opposite 8, Victoria Buildings. The lamp columns and guard posts have been made and supplied by Messrs. Young and Co., of Eccleston Iron Works, from Patterns specially designed for this Parish, and which are the exclusive property of the Vestry. 67 Maintenance of Footways. Asphalte Footways. The gravelled footway in Commercial Road, along the east wall of the Barracks to Chelsea Bridge Road, and also portions of Chelsea Bridge Road, Union Street, Passmore Street, and Ranelagh Grove, have been paved with asphalte by the Yal de Travers Asphalte Company. Repairs to Footways laid with York Stone. The gravel footway on the north side of the Grosvenor Road, between Westmoreland Street and Caledonia Street, has been paved with 3-inch York flagging, and charged to the respective owners or occupiers of property abutting thereon, to whom the cost has been apportioned. Notice had been previously served upon them giving them the option of laying down asphalte at their own cost, otherwise the Vestry would proceed to lay York flagging and recover the expense as directed by the 78th Section of the Metropolis Management Act. Mr. 0. H. Smith, of 111, Grosvenor Road, agreed to the offer of the Vestry, and he has therefore been allowed the difference of cost between Asphalte and York stone. The total cost of the work was £-ib9 5s. 2\d. The payment is distributed over a period of ten years. York flagging lias also been laid on the footways of other streets, the cost of which, with other particulars, is shown in the tabulated statement of Masons and Paviors' Work. There have been constantly employed during the last year, in the various repairs, &c., four masons and four paviors; they have relaid certain portions of the foot and carriageways which were worn, sunk, or broken, using new materials, 68 supplied by contract, where the old was not fit to relay ; they have also made good the pavements disturbed for gas, water, new buildings, alterations, &c. They have used, during the year, 1,362 yards super, of York paving, and the cost has been as follows:— Yds. Super. £ s. d.

The Gas Sub-Committee have given considerable attention to the question of Street Lighting, and a great and marked improvement in the lighting of some of the streets in the Parish, particularly in the District of South Belgravia, has been effected by the simple alteration of the position of certain lamps, which the Committee after several evening inspections considered desirable. 70 Piccadilly Lighting. The Yestry at the recommendation of the Gas SubCommittee granted permission to Messrs. Bray, of Leeds, to light up a portion of Piccadilly from St. James's Street to Whitehorse Street with their Improved Street Lantern and Patent Flat Flame-Burners, upon condition that the expense of the extra gas consumed and the fixing up of the lanterns be borne by them. A similar privilege was granted to Messrs. Sugg & Co., but as they declined to conform to the conditions stated, their lanterns were not exhibited. The number of lamps lighted was 34 and the average amount of gas consumed by each was about 23 cubic feet per hour. The lighting was commenced in July last (1881), and continued until the 25th March. As a specimen of Street Lighting, the experiment carried out in Piccadilly by Messrs. Bray was a decided success, and the Yestry were so far satisfied with the result that they agreed to purchase the lanterns exhibited. Instead, however, of using the burners consuming 25 feet per hour, they substituted burners constructed so as to consume not more than 12 feet, nor less than 5 feet per hour, either of which standards could be adopted at will. At present the 34 lanterns are fitted with these burners, and consume only 5 feet of gas per hour, which is an increase of 2 feet over that consumed by the or dinary street lamps. Electric Lighting. The Committee have also had before them the question of Electric Lighting. Street Refuges. The whole of the Refuges in the Parish are lighted with Bray's Improved Street Lanterns and Patent Flat- 71 Flame Burners, the illuminating power varying according to the importance of the positions in which they are placed. Supply of Gas. The streets under the control of the Vestry have been lighted by gas supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company and the London Gas Company. The lighting of the public lamps in the portions of the Parish supplied with gas by the Gas Light and Coke Company has (since the 25th June, 1877) been lighted upon the average meter system; the Vestry carrying out the work of lighting, cleansing, and repairs by its own staff of lamplighters and other workmen, and the gas being paid for by meter indication, with the exception of those in Piccadilly already mentioned. The Cannel burners in the In-Wards, which consumed 2^ ft. per hour previous to April 1880, have been replaced with burners consuming 3 ft. per hour, consequently there has been more gas consumed, and the cost has been a little greater. The portion of the Parish known as the Grosvenor Place District has been supplied with Gas by the London Gas Company at a contract price of £3 5s. per lamp per annum, including lighting, cleansing, and repairs. The following statement shows the cost of lighting the Parish, both by the meter system and by contract:— By the Meter System. G-as Light and Colce Company. Gas.

In June last the Vestry received notices from the Metropolitan Board of Works requiring the Vestry under the powers conferred upon the Board by the Metropolis 73 ment (Thames River Prevention of Floods) Amendment Act, 1879, to carry out certain works for effectually protecting the property owned by the Vestry from floods and inundations caused by the overflowing of the Thames. The notices were accompanied with plans and sections showing the nature of the proposed works, together with an estimate of the cost. The original height to which the owners were required by the Board to raise their wharf walls was 5 feet above the Trinity high-water mark, which was 6 inches above the then highest known tide. As, however, the high tide of the 18th January last (1881) caused the river to rise almost to this level, the Engineer of the Metropolitan Board deemed it necessary to raise the river wall an additional 6 inches. The level adopted, therefore, for the protection of river-side premises, as. advised by the Board's Engineer, is 5 feet 6 inches above Trinity high-water mark. The river wall of the Belgrave Wharf, and the entrances to some of the gateways of the wharves on the Grosvenor Road, and also portions of the footway, have been raised to the above height by the Metropolitan Board of Works, to whom the Vestry deputed the responsibility of carrying out the work. The cost of the work so far as this Parish is liable will be paid by the Vestry. Thames Embankment. The Vestry have, for the convenience of the public, placed 12 garden seats on the Grosvenor Road, between the western boundary of the Parish and Claverton Street. The seats have been specially designed, and were made and supplied by the Falkirk Iron Company. Cleansing, Sweeping, &c. The cleansing of the streets has been done by men in the employment of the Vestry. The sweepings in the 74 In-Wards have been removed under contract by Mr. Hobbs; the sweepings in the Out-Wards have been carted from the streets by the Parish carts to the Parish Wharf, and thence barged away under contract by Mr. Cole. With the view of preventing disagreeable smells the principal thoroughfares have, as occasion required, been thoroughly washed, and the effect has proved most beneficial. Dusting. The removal of dust has been carried out under contract in the In-Wards by Mr. Hobbs ; in the Out-Wards by Mr. Covington. Watering the Streets. The spreading of the water in the Streets of the InWards has been done by Mr. Hobbs; in the Out-Wards by the horses and carts belonging to the Vestry. The water for the In-Wards has been supplied by the Grand Junction Water Company, and that in the OutWards by the Chelsea Water Company. Purchase of Wharves, &c. The Vestry having decided to undertake and carry out the cleansing and watering of the streets throughout the Parish by the use of their own plant, &c., in preference to continuing the contract system hitherto adopted, and having for this purpose acquired the necessary premises adjoining the Parish Wharf at Ebury Bridge, it became requisite, in order to adapt the new wharves to the requirements of the Parish, to make certain alterations and additions to the buildings and to the premises generally, so that everything might be in readiness to begin work on 26th March, 1882. These alterations, together with the purchase of horses, wagons, water vans, and other plant and machinery, involved a considerable outlay. The following is a statement of the estimated cost approved by the Vestry, and also a statement showing the actual expenditure:— 75 Estimate. Actual. £ £ £ s. d. £ s. d.

The chief items are:— 38 Water Vans 1 Water Cart 50 Slop Vans 8 Stone Carts 6 Sweeping Machines 54 Horses 1 Derrick 1 Gas Holder and Gas Testing Apparatus 1 Horse Roller &c., &c., &c. Horses. On the 25th March, 1881, the number of horses in stock the property of the Vestry was 29. Since then four horses have been sold by auction, and have realized £98 14s. Four horses were purchased to replenish the stock at a cost of £310 15s., and 25 were purchased, at a cost of £1,863, to meet the increased work (viz., watering and cleansing) in the In-Wards. The number of horses in stock, therefore, at the end of the past year (Lady-day 1882) was 54, the value of which I estimate at £3,742 17s. Stable Arrangements. The cost incurred, under this heading, in the maintenance of the Parish Plant, together with the keep of the above horses, including all labour and expenses, for the year ended Lady-day 1882, has been £8,380 4s. 11c?., viz.:— 77 Particulars. £ s. d. *Fodder 1,562 19 7 Veterinary Care 226 14 0 Harness 52 18 3 Repairs to Carts 212 9 10 „ Stables 1,218 14 4i Gas 36 4 6 „ Engine Fixing, &c. 171 17 2 Sundries, including Water, Oil, &c. 49 19 8 Wages to Carters, &c. 2,364 1 6½ Rent of Stables (estimated) 150 0 0 Purchase of Twenty-nine Horses 2,173 15 0 Purchase of Sixteen Water Yans £800 0 0 Purchase of Thirty Tip Wagons 1,425 0 0 Purchase of Two Sweeping Machines 80 0 0 Purchase of Thirty-Five Sets of Harness, &c. 282 10 4 2,587 10 4 £10,807 14 3 Cr. £ s. d.

With a view of obviating the inconvenience which is sometimes occasioned by placing heaps of gravel and sand, &c., on the side of the footways, severtil ballast pits, fitted with iron covers, have been built in the footway at various places throughout the Parish. These pits are depots in which is kept the gravel and sand used for spreading on the roads in frosty weather. Pits have been fixed in the following positions during the past year:— 6 in Park Lane—viz., 1 by Hamilton Place; 1 by Stanhope Gate; 1 by South Street; 1 by Mount Street; 1 by Grosvenor Street; and 1 by Green Street. 1 in Hanover Square, by Brook Street. 1 in Grosvenor Gardens, by Ebury Street. 1 in Lower Grosvenor Place, by Ebury Street. 2 in Grosvenor Place—viz., 1 by Halkin Street; 1 by Chester Street. 2 in Buckingham Palace Road—viz., 1 by Charlotte Street; 1 by Lower Grosvenor Place. 1 in Wilton Place, by Knightsbridge.

CORFIELD, M.A., M.D. (Oxon.), F.R.C.P. (Lond.), Professor of Hygiene and Public Health in University College, London, MEDICAI, OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST. (BEING HIS TENTH ANNUAL REPORT.) Co the Destrg of tin Parish of St. Gtorge, HANOVER SQUARE. My Lords and Gentlemen, The death-rate for the year 1881 was almost as low as the unprecedentedly low rate for 1880; this is more than I had expected, and shows, we may hope, that some of the causes of these very low rates are permanent sanitary improvements of one kind or another. The gross total of deaths registered in the Parish during the 52 weeks ending Saturday, December 31st, 1881, was 84 1,932, or 103 over the annual average for the preceding 10 years. The enumerated populations of the Parish and its subdistricts given in my last Annual Report were uncorrected; the corrected numbers are as follows:— Sub-District. Population. Hanover Square 16,862 Mayfair 13,491 Belgravia 59,220 Total for the Parish 89,573 Or 185 less than in 1871, the increase in Mayfair and Belgravia being more than counterbalanced by the decrease in Hanover Square, due, as stated in my last Annual Report, to the demolition of small houses, and the erection of workshops on their sites. Thus until the next Census is taken, we must, unless there are strong reasons for doing otherwise, regard the population of this Parish as stationary. It is to the enumerated population of London as 1 to 423/5, and to the estimated population of London for the middle of the year 1881 as 1 to 42¾. The high gross total of 1,932 deaths during the year is accounted for by the fact that no less than 812 deaths occurred in Public Institutions in the Parish; as our share of the deaths occurring in all the Public Institutions in London was only 394, our corrected total of deaths was only 1,514, as against an average of 1,663 during the preceding ten years; this is equivalent to a death-rate of 16*91 per thousand per annum, the average during the preceding ten years having been 1832. The rate for 1881 is lower than that hitherto recorded for any year, except 1880, when it was 16.64. 85 Table I. YEAR. Gross Total of Deaths. Deaths in Public Institutions.

The death.rate of Greater London, estimated population 4,791,856, was 20.3 per thousand per annum (against 21 in 1880), being, as just stated, 21.2 in London proper, and 16.4 in the Outer Ring; or, when corrected for the deaths in the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylums, only 16 in the Outer Ring (estimated population 960,137). Neither of the 23 large towns of the United Kingdom had nearly so low a death-rate as this Parish, the nearest to it being the following:— Brighton 19.0 Norwich 19.5 Bristol 19.6 Portsmouth 19.7 Bradford 19.7 Plymouth 19.9 Birmingham 20.0 and these varying from 2 to 3 per thousand above it. 87 The death-rate of Dublin, which had increased from 28 in 1877 to 36.1 in 1880, has gone down to 27.1 in 1881, a very remarkable decrease. Liverpool comes next to it with 26.7, a slight decrease on its rate for 1880; and then Manchester with 25.5, and Glasgow with 25.3. The deathrate of Salford, which is usually higher than that of Manchester, and which was 28 in 1880, has gone down to 22.6 in 1881. N.B.—The rates for the years 1877-1880, mentioned above, are different from those given for the same years in previous Reports, on account of the corrections of the estimated populations of the towns made since the Census was taken. Of 50 large town districts in England (excluding the 20 largest towns already referred to), only the following had lower death-rates than this Parish in 1881:— Reading 14.2 Maidstone 14.3 Dover 15.4 Cheltenham 15.9 Hastings 16.0 Walsall 16.5 Cambridge 16.6 and these mostly include country districts. The average rate for these 50 towns was 19.6 per thousand per annum, and the highest was 24.6 for Merthyr Tydfil. Our death-rate was, as usual, considerably below that of any large foreign city; the lowest among these being Christiania 18'8, Geneva 212, Copenhagen 22.1, and Philadelphia 22.5; and the highest, Madrid 37.4, Madras 38.8, and St. Petersburg 514. The death-rate of Madras declined from 44.8 in 1880 to 37.4 in 1881, while that of St. Petersburg rose from 46.1 in 1880 to 51.4 in 1881. 88 Table II. YEAR. Registered Births.

The birth-rate in London proper was 34.7, in Greater London, 346, and in the Outer Ring, 34.1. The average birth.rate of the twenty largest English towns was 35.6, the highest being those of Sunderland, 39.3, Salford, 38.8, Leicester, 38.4, and Sheffield, 38; and the lowest that of Brighton, 30.6. So that, as in 1880, Brighton has the lowest birth-rate and also the lowest death-rate among the large English towns. It should be mentioned also that the birth-rate of Dublin in 1881 was very low, only 29.l, which may partly account for its lowered death-rate. The deaths of children under one year of age were only 89 280, or less than in any year previously recorded; the percentage of these deaths to the registered births was 13.38, or lower than in any year except 1878, when it was lower on account of the high birth.rate, and the percentage of these deaths to the total deaths was 14.49, or lower than in any year except 1879, when it was 14.48. The mortality of children under one year of age is just under 134 to 1,000 births; this is surpassed only by Bristol, with 125, and Brighton, with 127, and it is equalled by Plymouth; while in Liverpool there were 173, and in Leicester 202 deaths of children under one year of age to 1,000 births. For London the number was 148, and the average for the 20 large English towns was 152. Table III. YEAR A. Persons aged sixty years and upwards. B. Violence. C. Inquest Cases. D. Uncertified.

In no one of the 20 large English towns is the mortality of persons of 60 years of age and upwards per 1,000 persons living as low as in this Parish, the nearest being Nottingham and Leicester, with 66, the highest Manchester, with nearly 97, and the average for the 20 towns between 74 and 75. The percentage of Violent Deaths was higher than previously recorded in any year except 1876, and, as usual, considerably higher than in London generally. The number of Inquest Cases, 129, was also higher than in any year except 1876; and the percentage of these cases to the total deaths, viz., 6.7, was a trifle under that for 1880, and under that for London generally. The uncertified deaths, mentioned for the first time in my Annual Report, were 31, or 16 per cent, of the deaths, while in London generally they were only 1.3 per cent, of the total deaths. Table IV. shows that, as usual, Hanover Square SubDistrict has the lowest birth-rate, and Mayfair the lowest death-rate, while Belgravia has the highest birth-rate and the highest death-rate of the 3 Sub-Districts. 91 Table IV, SUB-DISTRICT.

From the birth-rates and death-rates in thexabove Table I have calculated the mean duration of life in the Parish and in each of the Sub-Districts during the year 1881, and find them to be as follows:— Mean Duration of Life. Hanover Square Sub-District 57.01 Mayfair „ 66.20 Belgravia „ 46.35 Whole Parish 50.26 The mean duration of life in this Parish, during the last 7 years, has been as follows:— In 1875 it was 46.67 years. „ 1876 „ 47.96 „ „ 1877 „ 49.52 „ „ 1878 „ 48.03 „ „ 1879 „ 48.55 „ „ 1880 „ 58.01 „ „ 1881 „ 50-26 „ So that the average mean duration of life in this Parish, during those 7 years, has been almost exactly 50 years. The mean duration of life in London, during the last 4 years, has been, according to my calculations, as follows:— In 1878 it was 34-24 years. „ 1879 „ 34.23 „ „ 1880 „ 35.17 „ „ 1881 „ 35.87 „ 94 Table V.

Viz., „ 8; „ „ 20; „ „ „ 1. 95 From Table V. we find that the total number of deaths from Infectious Diseases and Diarrhœa, viz., 136, was less than in either of the preceding 10 years, and considerably less than the annual average, which is 188'5. The 136 deaths are equivalent to 1.5 per 1,000 persons living, at all ages, while the rate for London was 3.6, and that of the 20 large English towns 3.4 per 1,000 living. The only town whose zymotic death-rate was as low as that of this Parish was Plymouth, where it was also 1.5 per 1,000 living. The numbers of deaths from Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Qough, Fever, and Diarrhoea were below the decennial averages, while those from Small-pox were slightly above the average, and from Diphtheria considerably above it. As compared with last year, there was an increase in the deaths from Small-pox, Measles, and Fever, and a decrease in those from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea. The epidemic of Small-pox, which prevailed in London generally, caused 9 deaths in this Parish, the largest number recorded in any year since 1871, when there were 59, except 1877 when 12 were recorded. The Scarlet Fever epidemic of 1879-80 ended in October 1880 ; and during 1881 there were only 18 deaths from this disease in the Parish, as against 40 in 1880, and an annual average of 26. Of the 18 deaths from Scarlet Fever, 2 were deaths of non-parishioners, at St. George's Hospital, from Kidney Disease after Scarlet Fever. Of the 14 deaths from Diphtheria, 6 were those of nonparishioners, at St. George's Hospital; 2 were imported; and 1 was registered as " Sloughing Sore Throat." There were only 15 deaths from Whooping Cough, as against 50 in 18*0, and a decennial average of nearly 42 ; 96 this is the lowest annual number recorded since 1870, the nearest to it being 19 in 1877. The number of deaths from the Continued Fevers, viz., 24, although less than the decennial average, was higher than in either 1879 or 1880. Of the 24 deaths, 3 were recorded as from Typhus, 20 from Enteric (Typhoid) Fever, and 1 from Simple Continued Fever. Of the 3 recorded as from Typhus Fever, one was that of a non-parishioner, who died in St. George's Hospital, and whose death was certified as from " Fever, probably Typhus;" one was, I believe, really from Enteric Fever, a child of the same family having died of that disease only 6 days before; and the third was that of a servant, who had not been away anywhere for a fortnight before her illness. Of the 20 deaths from Enteric (Typhoid) Fever, 6 were those of non-parishioners, in St. George's Hospital; one was shown to have been imported, one was merely registered as "Fever," one as "Bilious Fever," and another *ras a very doubtful case—I believe not Typhoid at all. Diarrhoea caused only 33 deaths, a smaller number than in any year except 1879, when there were 32 deaths from Diarrhoea; the average annual number is 52. Small-Pox in London. No less than 2,371 deaths from Small-pox occurred in London during 1881, as against only 475 in 1880; the numbers for the last 5 years have been as follows:— 1877 2,544 deaths. 1878 1,416 „ 1879 458 „ 1880 475 „ 1881 2,371 „ 97 thus the epidemic only abated in severity in 1879 and 1880, and became again extremely severe in 1881, so severe that the Small-pox death-rate of 1881 was only exceeded seven times in the previous 43 years. " In 885 of the 2,371 fatal cases of Small-pox, no reliable statement was made as to previous vaccination or nonvaccination. Of the remaining 1,486, only 524, or 35*3 per cent., were certified to have been vaccinated, while 962, or 64-7 per cent., were certified to have been unvaccinated." Among the unvaccinated about three-quarters of the deaths occurred in persons under 20 years of age, while among the vaccinated three-quarters of the deaths occurred in persons over 20 years of age; this shows quite clearly that vaccinated people are protected during the early years of life, and that the protection diminishes, and requires to be renewed by revaccination. On account of the interest attaching to the question of Small-pox Hospitals in the Metropolis, the Registrar-General has compiled a Table, showing the deaths from Small-pox in the various Metropolitan Districts during the 5 years 1877 to 1881. From this table it appears that, on dividing the Districts into 5 groups—Central, Western, Southern, Northern, and Eastern, the mortality was least in the Central Group and greatest in the Eastern Group ; and in neither of these groups is there a Small-pox Hospital. " The group with the lowest Small-pox death-rate is the one which contains no Hospital, but sends the largest proportion of its cases to Hospitals outside its limits. The group with the highest Small-pox death-rate is that which has no Hospital within its limits, and makes less use than any other of the Hospitals outside its limits." These results are particularly interesting to our Parish, as we have no Small-pox or Fever Hospital within our g 98 limits, and make the most use we can of those outside our boundaries; your Committee of Works having arrived at the conclusion that this was the best plan, and having my full concurrence in that view. Sanitary Work. For the Year ending March 31s£, 1882. The following Table has been compiled for me by Mr. Joseph Snook, your Sanitary Inspector, from the Report Book:— Table VI. Various kinds of Complaints of Nuisances, ^c., from April ls£, 1881, to March 31s£, 1882. Total number of Complaints 597 Notices served 85 Houses and premises limewhited 42 Houses disinfected after infectious diseases 227 Old brick drains abolished, and glazed stoneware pipes substituted 27 New drains constructed 7 Drains unstopped and repaired 71 Drains trapped and ventilated, sinks disconnected, &c. 32 Closets supplied with water 33 Closets unstopped and repaired 52 Roofs repaired 3 New dust bins provided 6 Dust bins renewed, repaired, new covers, &c. 19 Cisterns repaired, new covers, &c. 22 New cisterns provided 8 W aste pipes disconnected 41 Removal of animals improperly kept (cases of) 0 99 Meat, fish, &c., condemned (cases of) 7 Overcrowding abated 6 Cesspools abolished 10 Accumulation of dung, straw, &c., removed 49 Various nuisances removed 62 No cause for complaint on inspection 43 Legal proceedings taken 0 Cases could not assist 4 Cases referred to Surveyor 21 Cases referred to Police 3 Licensed cow-sheds 6 Licensed slaughter-houses 12 Cases removed to Hospitals 157 Inspection of houses after cases of infectious diseases, viz.— Typhoid and low fever 13 Typhus fever 1 Scarlet fever 103 Small-pox 113 Diphtheria 6 The articles disinfected in the hot-air disinfecting chamber belonging to the Parish were as follows:— 180 Beds 220 Bolsters 195 Mattresses 424 Pillows 95 Palliasses 165 Carpets 315 Quilts 50 Hearth-rugs 420 Blankets 75 Curtains 326 Sheets 160 Towels 70 Dresses 50 Cushions 50 Shawls 81 Table Covers 90 Coats 70 Rugs 70 Waistcoats And a large quantity of sundry articles. 100 The total number of complaints attended to, and of notices served, was rather smaller than in 1880; in many instances, however, several nuisances are abated at one house and put down as one complaint; thus in one house several waste pipes of cisterns and sinks may be disconnected from the drains and not entered separately. It was not necessary to take out any summons, as all the notices were complied with. The number of houses and of articles of clothing, &c., disinfected after cases of infectious diseases, and the number of cases of such diseases removed to hospitals, were considerably higher than in 1880, owing to the epidemic of Small-pox. A localized outbreak of Small-pox of rather a serious character took place in Aylesford Street, Pulford Street, and St. George's Square, Pimlico, at the end of May and in the first half of June 1881. The cases occurred as follows in those streets:— In March 2 cases. „ April 2 „ „ May 6 „ „ June 23 „ By careful isolation and thorough disinfection, combined with re-vaccination of susceptible persons, it was stamped out, and no cases occurred after June 16th. There were 4 deaths among these cases, and besides these only 4 were treated at home, all the rest being removed to Hospital with one exception, that of a servant girl, who sent a fellow-servant for a fly while the ambulance was being fetched, and drove away in it. The fly was found and disinfected, but it was not thought advisable to take any further proceedings. 101 The number of houses inspected after cases of Enteric (Typhoid) fever was rather less than in 1880. The Markets have been regularly inspected and kept in good order, so that in only 7 instances has it been necessary to condemn articles of food exposed for sale. The Slaughter-houses and Cow-sheds are also regularly inspected and kept in a cleanly condition. No license was opposed either by the Parish or by the Metropolitan Board of Works. I prepared, by order of the Committee of Works, a Special Report on "the Sanitary Condition of the houses in George Street, Hart Street, Brown Street, Providence Court, and Tom's Court, Grosvenor Square, and the immediate neighbourhood," from which it was seen that infectious diseases were of rare occurrence there; and "that the sanitary condition of the houses, whether as regards overcrowding, or the removal of refuse matters, or the water supply, is, at any rate, not such as to cause the slightest anxiety." A new Disinfecting Station has been built at the Parish Yard in Pimlico Road, and one of Dr. Ransom's Selfregulating Disinfecting Ovens fixed in it; this is a great improvement on the old station and apparatus, and has been constructed so that there is no air communication between the chamber in which the infected articles are received, and that in which the disinfected ones are put before their return home, except through the interior of the stove. The Alkali, &c., Works Regulation Act, to Consolidate the Alkali Acts of 1863 and 1874, which provides for the registration and inspection of various chemical works, &c., came into operation on January 1st, 1882; but there are no works affected by it in this Parish. 102 Table VII.

In both cases the average quality was decidedly superior to that of the preceding year, and the improvement in the winter months was very marked. During the hot weather in July, the Grand Junction 103 Company's supply was not sufficient for the wants of the districts supplied by it; and this deficiency was aggravated by the bursting of a 30-inch main. A deficiency of water is an especially serious matter in hot weather, and the public have a right to insist that the arrangements made by the Water Companies shall be such as to render such an occurrence practically impossible. The common gas supplied by the London Gas Company has been examined by me from time to time at their testing room, and has always been found to be above the required standard of illuminating power, and to satisfy the prescribed tests for ammonia and sulphuretted hydrogen. For the information of the Parishioners, I may mention that a hospital carriage for removing persons suffering from infectious diseases is kept at the Workhouse, in Mount Street; but those who are in a position to bear the expenses of their support should apply to the London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, Islington; or, in case of small-pox, at the Highgate Small-pox Hospital, where they can be accommodated on favourable terms. I have the honour to be, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. H. CORFIELD, M.A., M.D. (Oxon.), F.R.C.P.

The other 152 samples were all purchased under my direction by your Inspector. 105 Of the 4 adulterated samples of Milk, 3 were bought for information, and on purchasing other samples for the purpose of prosecution these were found in two cases to be genuine, and in the third to be skimmed but not watered (making the fourth adulterated sample). The vendor was warned by order of the Committee of Works. The adulterated Coffees contained chicory to greater or less extent, and some were labelled to that effect. A number of cases of adulteration of Coffee with chicory have recently been dismissed with costs, on the ground that prejudice to the purchaser was not proved. The adulterated Mustards contained wheat starch and turmeric, and, in one instance, gamboge—a very rare and a serious adulteration. A second sample bought at the same shop (for prosecution) was genuine. The adulterated Peppers merely contained small quantities of rice starch. Most of the samples of Tea contained small quantities of " Lie" tea, but no foreign leaves. The adulterated sample of Brandy was purchased at a house where a watered sample had been previously obtained. The vendor, Edmund Pinder, of the Globe Public-house, 43, North Audley Street, was convicted and fined 5s. and 23s. costs, for selling a sample of brandy 31 degrees under proof (25 degrees under proof being the minimum allowed by the Act). The number of samples analysed, and the number found adulterated, were almost exactly the same as during the preceding 12 months. W. H. COEFIELD, Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry, Public Analyst.
