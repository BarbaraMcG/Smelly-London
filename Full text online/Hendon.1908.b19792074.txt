HENR 3 ANNUAL REPORT of the SANITARY CONDITION of The Rural District of bendon, FOR THE YEAR 1908, by R. LESLIE ROMER, M.R.C.S., Eng., L.R.C.P., Lond. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. bendon: Warden&Co., Ltd., Printers, " Hendonand Finchley Times " Office, Hendon. 1909. The Rural District of bendon. Area, 11,055 Acres. Estimated Population, 12,924. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen,— I have the honour of presenting you my Annual Report upon the sanitary condition of your District. It is the 14th of the new series, and covers the year 1908. The general sanitary condition of the District is good, although the death-rate has risen from 7.8 per 1,000 last year to 8.5 per 1,000 this. Section. I. AREA AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF DISTRICT. The area of the District is 11,055 acres. It lies upon the southern and western slopes of the spur of high land running from the Barnet District and jutting out into the Weald of Harrow. Topography. The dividing lines of the five parishes run approximately north and south, the northern portion of the parishes resting on the hill and the southern lying in the valley. 4 The. highest point in the District, 502 feet above Ordnance datum, is on the Watford Road at the Hertfordshire boundary. The lowest point, about 150 feet, is to be found at the south-east corner of Pinner parish. The District is distinctly a residential one, being somewhat heavily timbered, and has a very small acreage of arable land. The agricultural portion of it is laid down in grass, and the chief agricultural product is hay. Running from cast to west the parishes come in the order shown in Table A. Geology. The district lies upon the great London clay bed, which is cappcd on the higher land by patches of gravel of varying thickness. In same places, notably in the north-east corncr of Harrow Weald, the subsoil water rises to within a foot or 18. inches of the surface cf the gravel. Public Open Spaces. Besides the Stanmore Cricket Ground (seven acres) Stanmore Marsh (14 acres), the Little Common, Stanmore (6¼ acres), and the Pinner Beds (10 acres), the princijial Common lands are those of Harrow Weald and Great Stanmore. The area of the former is 34¾ acres, of the latter 121½ acres. Section II. I have again to thank Mr. Johnson, the Sanitary Inspector, and the Assistant Overseers, for their kind help in procuring the necessary information as to the number of inhabited houses in the District. I am therefore able to estimate the population as 12,924. The following Table A shews the estimated population to the middle of 1908, together with the deaths and death-rate in each of the five parishes. 5 TABLE A.

Birth Rate, 19.4. Infantile Mortality, 79.0. Zymotic Mortality, 0.23. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. Two hundred and fifty-one births, of which three were illegitimate, were registered. The numbers for 1906 and 1907 were 205 and 216 respectively. The birth-rate for 1907 was 17.6; for 1908 the rate is 19.4, which is a most satisfactory increase. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE, The number of deaths registered in the District was 95 ; of these one died in the Stanmore Cottage Hospital. The County Medical Officer kindly sent me a list of 17 persons belonging to the District, who had died in various public institutions outside the District, 6 Principal causes of death. The corrected number of deaths is 110, as two deaths registered in the District were not residents, which gives the death-rate of 8.5, as compared with 7.8 last year. Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 15 deaths, viz.: Bronchitis 5, Pneumonia 10. This number again is lower than that of last year, when there were 20 deaths from this cause. There was one death from Measles, one from Scarlet Fever, and one from Enteric. There were no deaths from Small Pox or Whooping Cough. Influenza caused five deaths. The number of deaths from Cancer is the same as last year, viz.: 10, the sex and age being:— Male: 85, 63, 59, 55, 51, 43, 27 = 7. Female: 74, 63, 43=3. Last year there were six females and four males registered. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The number of deaths of infants under one year has risen slightly from 13 last year to 20 this; the death-rate has risen to 79.6 in spite of a substantial increase in the number of births. PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. One death from Measles and one from Scarlet Fever were the only deaths under this heading, making the deathrate 0.15. 7 Section III. Thirty-six cases of infectious disease were notified. This is a large reduction on the number of last year, when 60 cases occurred. Their distribution was as follows:—Diphtheria 13, Erysipelas 1, Scarlet Fever 18, Enteric Fever (Typhoid) 3, and Puerperal Fever 1. Scarlet Fever. Of the Scarlet Fever 12 were notified from Harrow Weald Enteric, and Pinner. There was one fatal case, an adult of 20. The remaining cases were chiefly among school children. Three cases of Enteric were notified, one of these unfortunately proved fatal. Section IV. ISOLATION HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION. The accommodation of this Hospital consists of 20 beds and cots. As I pointed out last year, there is a great need of two small Observation Wards, as we have again had to deal with many cases of mixed infection, and the impossibility of sufficiently isolating the cases has prolonged the time of their detention in the Hospital. Many of the cases were on the point of being dismissed from the Hospital as Convalescent when they succumbed to a fresh infection. There is no accommodation for cases of Small Pox. Section V. GENERAL SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES AND ADMINISTRATION. There have been built during the year 30 houses in Edgware, 26 in Little Stanmore, 3 in Great Stanmore, 29 in Harrow Weald, and 250 in Pinner; giving a total of 338 for the whole District. Houses and Housing Accommodation. 8 Overcrowding. There were 12 cases of over-crowding, and all were abated. Common Lodging Houses. There are no Common Lodging Houses in the District. Houses Let in Lodgings. Bye-laws have been adopted, but no premises are on the Register. Pig Keeping and Manure Middens There are no Bye-laws respecting pigs. Nine cases of foul surroundings were dealt with, and all were remedied. In one case it was necessary to redrain the premises. On the whole there is not much to complain of as to the manner in which the piggeries are kept, but I should advise you to adopt Byelaws to regulate these matters. Movable Dwellings. There were 103 vans inspected, including 36 at Pinner Fair. Sixty-five of these were moved on; but these people were not so troublesome as last year. Harrow Weald still seems a happy hunting ground for these vagrants, as more than half (66) were in that parish. Water Supply. The Colne Valley Water Company supply 99 per cent, of the houses in the District. One complaint was received as to the water not being clear; probably it was due to some temporary work on the main, as it was quite clear when inspected, and there was no recurrence. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal Of the houses in your District 98 per cent. are now connected with the sewer. One house was inspected where the drain ran into a cesspool. The drain was connected with the sewer and the cesspool filled up. Slaughter Houses. The nine Slaughterhouses in the District are inspected about once a week. Two contraventions of the Regulation" were dealt with. Cowsheds. There are 33 Cowsheds on the Register, and 89 inspections were made. Fifteen contraventions of the Regulations were detected. There are about 449 Cows in the District. There were 16 cases of Cow Pox on one farm, and two of the men employed contracted the disease. 9 There are 27 on the Register, and 63 visits have been Milk Shops and Dairies. paid. There were seven contraventions of the Bye-laws. One milkshop in Little Stanmore was closed. There are none in the District. Offensive Trades A few organs were seized. It is a difficult matter to detect diseased meat in such a scattered district as this, as the proper method is to inspect the animal when being dressed, and it is quite impossible for one Sanitary Inspector to do this. Unsound Food. The work of collecting house refuse has much improved. There were 56 complaints, but the majority were received before the present Contractor started. House Refuse Collection. There is one Public Mortuary at Pinner, situated in the Churchyard. The Cottage Hospital and Isolation Hospital of Stanmore have each a Mortuary of their own. Mortuary Accommodation. Pour hundred and nine precautionary notices were served, including caravans and house refuse removal. There were 93 complaints. One hundred and nineteen premises were cleansed and repaired. Nuisances. One house was closed under the Houses of Working Classes Act. Two houses were closed by agreement with the owners. One hundred and fifteen drains were examined; 69 were cleaned and repaired. Fourteen waste pipes and rain pipes were disconnected, and eleven disconnecting traps and chambers were inserted. Nineteen drains were reconstructed. The Sanitary Inspector made 402 house to house inspections. There were 1,346 inspections, and 823 re-inspections. This entails a large amount of work and time. One hundred and fifty-six inspections of premises have been made in connection with infectious diseases. House to Home Inspection. 10 Factories and Bakehouses, and Workshops. There are now 51 on the Register, as against 23 last year—a large increase. There were four contraventions detected. The Tables at the end of this report are a record of the indefatigable work of Mr. Johnson, your Sanitary Inspector. The work is greatly on the increase, owing to the increased population. I wish to thank Mr. Johnson for his ready cooperation, and for his careful management in all the various matters connected with our work. Bdgware Church has during the year been completely and efficiently drained, and the subsoil in the Church, which was impregnated with animal matter and saturated with water, has been removed, and the Church is now in a thoroughly sanitary state. I wish to thank Mr. Webb, the Surveyor, and Mr. Johnson, the Sanitary Inspector, for their supervision and kind assistance to me in this matter. Public Health Tuberculosis Regulation Act, 1908. This Act has only been in force a few months. At present there are no cases which require to be dealt with, and I have received no notifications. ISOLATION HOSPITAL. Cases: 72. Deaths: 0. During the past year 72 cases were treated in the Hospital, and I am glad to say there were no deaths. This is five less than the number for the preceding year, but the incidence of infectious diseases was much smaller. Of the 72 cases, 52 were Scarlet Fever, and 20 Diphtheria. Seven cases of Scarlet Fever and three of Diphtheria remained over from 1907. 11 Sixty-two fresh cases were admitted, 45 of these being Scarlet Fever and 17 Diphtheria, a decrease of two on last year's admissions. Of these 38 cases came from outside the District. At the end of the year seven cases of Scarlet Fever and one of Diphtheria remained in the Hospital. There were seven cases of Diphtheria complicated with Scarlet Fever, and two cases of Scarlet Fever and Measles. One case that was admitted as Scarlet Fever proved to be German Measles, but I had been able to isolate this child from the commencement so that there was no spread of the infection, and the child was discharged at the end of three weeks. Several of the cases of Scarlet Fever have been severe, and but for the excellent nursing and devoted attention of the Matron, Miss Streeter, and her thoroughly able staff of nurses, I am afraid our record would not have been so good. I beg to tender Miss Streeter and her staff my sincere and warmest thanks. In conclusion, I beg to thank you for the kindness and consideration you have shown me during the past year. I am, Yours faithfully, R. LESLIE ROMER. 12 I. II. III. Institutions within the District receiving sick and infirm persons from outside the District.
