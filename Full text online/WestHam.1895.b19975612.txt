Gentlemen, I beg to submit my report on the work of the Public Health Department during the year 1895, and express my regret at the delay in its appearance. The opening of our hospital for infectious diseases, together with the preparation for and carrying out of the collection of house refuse by the Council, necessarily inundated me with work during the greater part of the year, and occupied time which should have been devoted's to the purposes of this report. It is extremely to be regretted that arrangements could not have been made to have included West Ham in the Metropolitan census of 1896. I know of no district where a quinquennial census would be more useful. As it is, I entirely agree with our Borough Accountant in thinking that the estimate of the Registrar-General of 249,000 for the population of West Ham in the middle of 1895 is too large, and, for the purposes of my statistics, have fixed the population at the middle of the year at 239,000. Four thousand six hundred and fifty-six deaths were registered, being an increased of 630 over those of the previous year, and making an annual recorded death-rate of 19.4, and a corrected death-rate of 20.9 per 1,000. 2 I he births registered numbered 8,591, being an increase of 502 on the record of previous year, and giving, on the before-suggested population, an annual birth-rate 35.9 per 1,000. The deaths from the seven principal zymotic diseases numbered 951, giving an Annual zymotic death-rate of 3.9 per 1,000, which is .3 per 1,000 higher than the Average zymotic death-rate for the past ten years. Comparisons of the foregoing rates can be made by referring to the tables at the lend of this report. It is sometimes maintained, and not without cause, that certain districts are more unhealthy than the more favoured parts of the Borough. I showed in my annual report for 1891 that the variation in the death-rates of the four wards of the Borough were not great, being as follows:—Stratford Ward, 19.8 per 1,000; Forest Gate, 17.6; Plaistow, 18.5; Canning Town, 20.5. That being census year it was easy to extract the correct death-rates; at the present time a correct estimate is impossible without some form of census. I hope, however, by taking somewhat smaller areas, to give a comparative list of death-rates in selected districts of the Borough. At the same time I feel convinced that the margin of difference will not be unduly large when the characters both of population and habits are taken into consideration. These statistics will appear early in the ensuing year, INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Small-pox.—The cause of this disease during the year was marked by a serious outbreak in February at the Seamen's Branch Hospital, Royal Albert Dock. The first case occurred in a Lascar who was removed from a vessel in the docks to the Seamen's Hospital, and was there found to be suffering from small-pox. He was removed to the hospital ships of the Metropolitan Asylums Board by the Port Sanitary Authority, but not before the infection had been conveyed to the members of the hospital staff, of whom no less than eight were attacked by the disease, and removed to the hospital ships of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, beside several other cases which were directly traceable to the same source. I personally visited the hospital and 3 found that arrangements had been made for closing the hospital both for in-patients and out-patients, that the cases still in the wards should be kept under observation for??? fortnight at least; and that none of the servants who live out should be allowed to ??? to their homes,' but would sleep within the hospital building until all fear of the developing the disease should have passed. In addition, I removed and fumigated a large number of articles of bed and bod linen which had been exposed to infection, and thoroughly fumigated the whole of the hospital premises. There was a complete disappearance of the disease during the four months from the end of March until the end of July, when it reappeared in isolated cases in various parts of the Borough. In July instructions were received from the Local Government Board to the effect that all cases of small-pox should be personally visited by the Medical Officer of Health, and that he should report to the Board on the measures taken to ensure the isolation, &c., of each case. In August a case of small-pox occurred at a common lodging-house in Tenb??? Road, Stratford. In this case the patient came from Leicester to London about twelve or fourteen days previous to the development of the disease. He slept one night at Winldersmuth House—a common lodging-house off Commercial Street, Whitechapel (from which several cases of small-pox are said to have been removed just previously)—and then came to the lodging-house in Tenby Road. Here he became very ill, and went into the West Ham Union Workhouse, where it was at once discovereds that he was suffering from small-pox. I at once made the necessary arrangements and had him removed to the hospital ships of the Metropolitan Asylums Board the same evening. Isolated cases of small-pox continued to occur at short intervals throughout the Borough, but towards the end of October the epidemic broke out with redoubled virulence, the principal centre of the outbreak being Nelson Street, Canning Town??? The epidemic at once began to assume alarming proportions, and, as an illustration of the manner in which the disease may be spread, I would cite the following circumstances which, undoubtedly, had an important bearing on the cause of the outbreak About the end of August or beginning of September, a family named Neicho went hop-picking on a farm at Waterbury, near Maidstone, Kent. Several of the hop-pickers were suffering from what was said to be " German Measles," and are said to have been 4 ???oved (presumably to hospital). About the middle of September the wife of one of ???members of the family returned with her husband to Faulkner Street, Forest Gate. day or two later she was found to be suffering from small-pox, and was removed to Hospital on the 16th September, and ten days later her husband was also removed to Hospital suffering from the same disease. About this time the rest of the family returned ???21, Nelson Street, and one or more of the boys are said to have been covered with ???lotches on their hands and faces, and were allowed to run about the streets and into ???e neighbours' houses. On the 12th October one of the children died, and is said to have been certified by the doctor in attendance as dying from "measles," and ought to be buried quickly. A strong rumour got about, however, that the child had not died from "measles" as stated, but from small-pox. Assuming this rumour was correct, it would appear that the disease was imported into the Borough by the Neicho family from Kent, and so contributed very largely to the outbreak. Scarlet Fever.—Nothing specially worthy of note occurred in connection with this disease during the first half of the year. About the beginning of August, however, serious and long-continued outbreak of the disease occurred at the Forest Gate District Schools. From the date of the first case, August 8th, until the end of the year, nearly 80 children were attacked with this disease, and in every case were removed to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. As, however, the Forest Gate District Schools may be regarded as a tiny portion of London planted in West Ham, the cost of the treatment of these cases did not fall upon the ratepayers of the Borough, but was taken by the Metropolitan Asylums Board and apportioned to the various districts in the Metropolitan area from which the children had been drawn. Diphtheria.—This disease showed a marked tendency to rises throughout the year ; but by far the greater proportion of cases was in children of the school age, viz., from three to thirteen years. During the first half of the year the disease was evenly distributed throughout the Borough. No localised epidemic in connection with any particular school can be said to have existed during the period in question. In the latter half of the year, however, there was a distinct increase in the number of cases among scholars attending the Godwin Road Schools, but not sufficiently serious to varrant the closing of the schools. The sanitary arrangements of these schools were ???ot all that might be desired, and at my suggestion certain alterations were carried out by the Board, by which means the sanitary arrangements were brought quite up to late. I do not, however, attribute the diphtheria at the Godwin Road Schools to the 5 defective sanitary conditions in the schools themselves, and, in my opinion, the ave??? child when attending one of the schools of the Board is placed under more favoura??? sanitary surroundings than those pertaining to the average private house; apart fr??? the one necessary condition of the aggregation of large numbers of children. With regard to the physical conditions of the district which may have had a influence on the spread of diphtheria, it may be mentioned that the Stratford and Forest Gate Wards are from seventeen to twenty-two feet above ordnance datum, while the Plaistow and Canning Town Wards may be said to range in various parts between six and sixteen feet above ordnance datum. The soil is generally gravelly throughout, but there is a considerable amount of peaty alluvium resting upon a sub-soil of clay in some parts of the two latter wards, which is retentive of water, and gives rise to a universal dampness of soil even after small rainfalls. The dwellings vary greatly in character, the majority having been hastily erected in bye-gone times of cheap materials and with bad workmanship, necessitating an incessant watchfulness on the part of the Inspectors of Nuisances. A network of open ditches—the Dagenham system of sewers— intersects a large area of the Borough ; these ditches being filled at high tide with wats ??? from the river Lea, and at the same time taking the effluents from the sewage works ??? the two large and neighbouring districts of Walthamstow and Leyton, are at times in a??? foul condition. With regard to the possible sources of infection, I submit that the milk and food supplies may be entirely excluded. Sanitary defects were discovered in about fifty per cent. of the houses in which the disease occurred, but they were chiefly minor defects not in any way connected with drainage or the removal of excremental and other offensive matters, and were, in the large majority of cases, not such defects as could be associated with the conveyance of diphtheritic germs. Although I have mentioned the numerous offensive ditches running through parts of the Borough and regretted their periodical condition, it is apparent that the diphtheria of the Borough does not follow the course of these streams, and I can see no cause for the increase of that disease in West Ham, but the association of children together both in the school and in the street. Enteric Fever.—This disease showed a distinct increase on the preceding year—nearly one hundred more cases being notified. The cases appear to have been evenly distributed throughout the Borough and throughout the year, never showing in epidemic form. Nor could I satisfy myself that there was a common cause for any large number of attacks. 6 In this connection the valuable report of the Local Government Board on ???yster culture in reference to disease," is full of suggestion. Many of our cases have ???en imported from Southend, which is one of the favourite health resorts of our pulation, while oysters and other molluscs form a well-patronized section of the ???aturday-night markets in various parts of the Borough. Although the whole of the land proposed to be included in the hospital area at ???laistow had not been acquired, the Council decided to open two wards of the building purchased from the Poplar Board of Works for the reception of cases of diphtheria. The wards and associated offices having been repaired and renovated throughout and the drainage system entirely reconstructed by the Borough Engineer, your Committee placed upon the chairman (Councillor Hunns) and Councillor Threlford, in association with myself, the task of undertaking the preliminary details of furnishing, &c. In July your Committee appointed Dr. John Biernacki, medical superintendent, and Miss Minnie Drakard, matron. These officers came into residence in September and under their able supervision the final arrangements were conducted, and the two wards, containing 36 beds, were made ready for the reception of diphtheria cases by the 1st January, 1896. The following memoranda, issued by the Local Government Board during the year, are very pertinent to the foregoing clauses:— ON THE PROVISION OF ISOLATION HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES. " English communities nowadays recognise the advantage of isolation " hospitals as a means of preventing the spread of infectious diseases from "persons who cannot be properly isolated in their own homes. But too often " the provision of such hospitals is put off until some infectious disease is immediately threatening or has actually invaded a district. It cannot be too . " clearly understood that an isolation hospital, to fulfil its proper purpose of "sanitary defence, ought to be in readiness beforehand. During the progress "of an epidemic it is of little avail to set about hospital construction. The mischief of allowing nfection to spread from first cases will already have been "done, and this mischief cannot be repaired. Thus, hospitals provided during "an epidemic are mainly of advantage to particular patients; they have little "effect in staying the further spread of infection. Moreover, hospitals provided 7 . "under such circumstances, to be of any use must be large and costly, and th??? "construction can seldom be of a kind that is suited in after times for to " isolation requirements of their districts. "The present memorandum is designed to represent to urban and "rural district councils who are without means of isolation for first cases ??? "infectious sickness appearing in their districts, as also to those who ar??? "responsible for the health of special communities in public institutions o??? "elsewhere, the importance of providing isolation hospital accommodation, and "of doing so before the invasion of actual infection. It is further intended to "suggest to authorities of rural districts and of small towns the means by which "they may most advantageously make such provision. Some general principles. "to be held in view by all authorities who are about to establish isolation "hospitals for their districts will be illustrated in the course of the memo"randum. "As regards Villages.—Large villages and groups of adjacent "villages will commonly require the same sort of provision as towns. Where "good roads and proper arrangements for the conveyance of the sick have been "provided, the best arrangement for village populations is by a small building "accessible from several villages; otherwise the requisite accommodation for "(say) four cases of infectious disease in a village may at times be got in a "fairly isolated and otherwise suitable four-room or six-room cottage which has "been acquired by the authority; or by arrangement made beforehand with "some trustworthy cottage-holders, not having children, that they should "receive and nurse, on occasion, patients requiring such accommodation. "In towns, hospital accommodation for infectious diseases is wanted more "constantly, as well as in larger amount than in villages; and in towns there is "greater probability that room will be wanted at the same time for two or "more infectious diseases which have to be treated separately. The permanent "provision to be made in a town should consist of not less that four rooms, in "two separate pairs, each pair to receive the sufferers from one infectious disease, "men and women, of course, separately. The number of cases for which "permanent provision should be made must depend upon various considerations, "among which the size and the growth of the town, the housing and habits of its 8 "population, and the traffic of the town with other places, are the most impor"tant. There is no fixed standard, therefore, by which the standing hospital "requirements proper for a town can be measured. Furthermore, it is to be "remembered that occasions will arise (as where infection is brought into several "parts of a town at one time) when isolation provision, in excess of that "commonly sufficient for the town, will become needful. "For a town the hospital provision ought to consist of wards in one or "more permanent buildings, with space enough for the erection of other wards, "temporary or permanent. Considerations of ultimate economy make it wise "to have permanent buildings sufficient for somewhat more than the average "necessities of the place, so that recourse to temporary extensions may less "often be necessary. In any case, it is well to make the administrative offices "somewhat in excess of the wants of the permanent wards, because thus, at "little additional first cost, they will be ready to serve, when occasion comes, "for the wants of temporary extensions. "Plans illustrating the sanitary requirements of small hospitals for "infectious disease are arranged on three sheets accompanying the present "memorandum. Plan A, on the first sheet, is that of a little building to hold "two patients of each sex. On the second sheet a plan and a section (B) of a "rather larger hospital building are shown, providing for eight patients, with "separation of sex, and also of one infectious disease from another. A con"venient disposition of buildings upon site is also indicated on the same sheet. "The third sheet shows a plan and section (C) of a small pavilion, adapted to "receive six male and six female patients suffering under one kind of infectious "disease. It will be found that in all the plans proper standards of space are "observed, viz., not less than 2,000 cubic feet of air space, than 144 square feet "of floor space, and 12 linear feet of wall space to each bed; and that means "are provided for the adequate ventilation and warming of wards, and for "securing them from closet emanations and the like. In plan A, earth-closets, "in other plans water-closets, are indicated as the means of excrement disposal. "The latter are to be regarded as preferable where efficient sewers are available. "Places for washing and disinfection, and for a mortuary, are indicated. It "will be observed that an interval of 40 feet is everywhere interposed between "every building used for the reception of infected persons or things and the 9 "boundary of the hospital site. The boundary should have a close fence of ??? "less than 6 feet 6 inches in height, and the 40 feet of interval should no "afterwards be encroached on by any temporary building or other extension "the hospital. In the construction and arrangement of such temporary building "as may at times be wanted in extension of the permanent hospital the same "principles should be held in view. "In determining the locality where an infectious hospital should be "placed, the wholesomeness of the site, the character of the approaches, "together with the facilities for water supply, and for slop and refuse removal, "are matters of primary importance. "Hospitals for Small-pox.—Ever since the issue in 1882 of the "Report of the Royal Commission on small-pox and fever hospitals, great "difficulty has arisen in the selection of sites for the reception of patients "suffering from small-pox. Small-pox hospitals have again and again served to "disseminate that disease to neighbouring communities, and this, to use the "words of the Royal Commission, 'in spite of precautions almost in excess of "any that could have been anticipated.' There is, as yet, no evidence "available to indicate at what distance from populations, whether aggregated in "institutions or living in dwelling-houses, small-pox hospitals may be established "without risk to persons who are susceptible of small-pox infection; but that "distance is often a very considerable one. It may, however, be laid down, "with a view of lessening the risk of infection, that a local authority should not "contemplate the erection of a small-pox hospital: "1st. On any site where it would have within a quarter-of-a-mile of "it as a centre either a hospital, whether for infectious diseases "or not, or a workhouse, or any similar establishment, or a "population of 150-200 persons; "2nd. On any site where it would have within half-a-mile of it as a "centre a population of 500-600 persons, whether in one or "more institutions or in dwelling-houses. 10 "It must also be understood that even where the above conditions are "strictly fulfilled, there may be circumstances unier which the erection of a "small-pox hospital should not be contemplated. Cases in which there is any "considerable collection of inhabitants just beyond the half-mile zone, should "always call for especial consideration. "It has been suggested that small-pox hospitals may be so constructed "as not to be dangerous to neighbouring habitations; and that this can be done "by a system of passing through a furnace all outgoing air from infected wards "and places. But, thus far, the efforts made in this direction cannot be "regarded as having successfully attained the end in view. "Useful information on points of construction and administration of isolation hospitals, derived from experience of them in various parts of England "and Wales, will be found in a report (C.—3290) of the Medical Department, "1882, re-issued in 1894." R. THORNE THORNE, Local Government Board, Medical Officer. Medical Department, January, 1895. 11 MEMORANDUM ON EPIDEMIC INFLUENZA. "Influenza became epidemic in England in the winter of 1889-90; it "recurred in epidemic form in the spring of 1891, and was maintained up to "June of that year; a third epidemic took place in the winter of 1891-92, and, "after a minor recrudescence in the spring of 1893, a fifth prevalence on a wide "scale took place in the winter of 1893-94. England is now passing through a "sixth epidemic period. Two detailed reports have been issued by the Board "on the subject. The first was by Dr. Parsons, 'On the Influenza Epidemic "of 1889-90,' with an Introduction by Sir George Buchanan, M.D., F.R.S., "the Board's Medical Officer at that date. The second was a 'Further Report "on Epidemic Influenza, 1889-92,' by Dr. Parsons, with papers on the clinical "and pathological aspects of the disease, by Dr. Klein, F.R.S., and an Intro"duction by myself. "A 'Provisional Memorandum upon Precautions Advisable at time when "Epidemic Influenza threatens, or is prevalent,' was also drawn up by me in "January, 1892, and was issued by the Board to Local Sanitary Authorities. "The further study made by the Medical Department as to the natural "history of influenza, and as to its clinical and bacteriological characteristics, "goes to show that it is a disease against which it is most difficult to apply "measures of prevention with any substantial prospect of success. "Influenza is highly infective from person to person, its infectious quality "is often manifested before the disease is fully recognized, its incubation period "is one of the shortest of all infectious diseases, it varies so much in intensity "that many cases are never diagnosed at all, one attack confers no marked "immunity against another, and the infection is largely eliminated by means of "the lungs, the sputa of the sick being invariably charged, during the acute "stage of the disease, with its pathognomonic micro-organism. The disease calls "primarily for measures of isolation and of disinfection, but there are difficulties 12 "in making any such measures universally applicable. Wherever they can be "carried out, the following precautions should, however, be adopted:— "Ist. The sick should be separated from the healthy. This is "especially important in the case of first attacks in a locality "or a household. "2nd. The sputa of the sick should, especially in the acute stage of "the disease, be received into vessels containing disinfectants. "Infected articles and rooms should be cleansed and disinfected. "3rd. When influenza threatens, unnecessary assemblages of persons "should be avoided. "4th. Buildings and rooms in which many people necessarily con"gregate should be efficiently aerated and cleansed during the "intervals of occupation. "It should be borne in mind that the liability to contract influenza, and "also the danger of an attack, if contracted, are increased by depressing "conditions, such as exposure to cold, and to fatigue whether mental or "physical. "Attention should hence be paid at epidemic periods to all measures "tending to the maintenance of health, such as the use of clothing of suitable "warmth, and a sufficiency of wholesome food. "Persons who are attacked by influenza should at once seek rest, "warmth, and medical treatment, and they should bear in mind that the risk of "relapse, with dangerous complications, constitutes a chief danger of the "disease." R. THORNE THORNE. Local Government Board, Medical Department, March 6th, 1895. 13 Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.—During the year I reported the following houses with the undermentioned results:— Nos. I and 2, Nursery Cottages. (Rendered fit.) Nos. 23, 25, 35, 37, 39 and 41, Stanley Street. (Rendered fit.) Nos. 30, 32, 34 and 36, Poplar Street. (Closed.) Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, Ruckholt Mill Cottages. Nos. 1 and 3, Rathbone Street. (Closed.) Nos. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39, Carpenter's Road, (Rendered fit.) No. 31, High Street, Plaistow. Slaughter-houses and Knackers' Yards.—All the above were regularly inspected during the year. Fresh licenses were granted in respect of 307, Romford Road and Hoghall Farm, Beckton Road, and renewals granted in respect of 93 and 95, Vicarage Lane, and 14, Globe Crescent Road ; while an application for a slaughterhouse license at 86, Leyton Road was refused, the premises being in my opinion, quite unfit for the purpose. A knacker's license was transferred to Messrs. Harrison and Barber from the Horse Owners' Association in Sugar House Lane. The business of this firm was considerably extended and gave rise to considerable nuisance, which necessitated extensive alterations both of plant and procedure. Common Lodging-houses.—There has been a steady improvement in the management of the common lodging-houses during recent years, three most objectionable houses having been closed. During 1895 ???r. E. Leader was registered as keeper of No. 19, Tenby Road, and Mr. C. Harris as keeper of No. 69, Victoria Dock Road.
