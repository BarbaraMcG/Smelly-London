To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith, in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1913. The Birth Rate is 26.09 per 1,000 for Greenw ich and 24.5 for the whole of the County of London. The mortality statistics for the year are unfortunately not quite of so satisfactory a character as we have been in the habit of recording during recent years, the recorded Death Rate of 14.31 per 1,000 of the estimated population being slightly higher than 14.2 per 1,000, the Death Rate for the County of London, but below 14 7 per 1,000, the figure for the 96 large towns. The Death Rate for Greenwich, corrected according to difference of age and sex constitution in the population, as revealed by the recent Census enumeration, equals 14.0 per 1,000. Comparing Greenwich with the other Metropolitan Boroughs according to their corrected Death Rate,which is the fairest method of comparison, shows that Greenwich has the lowest Death Rate but 13 amongst the 29 Metropolitan Boroughs, the 13 Boroughs having a better Death Rate than Greenwich being Hampstead, Lew isham, Wandsworth, Stoke Newington, Woolw ich, Paddington, Camberwell, Hackney, Kensington, Hammersmith, Fulham, Chelsea, City of Westminster. Comparing our relative position with that of last year it will be seen that we occupy the thirteenth place among the other Metropolitan Boroughs in regard to our corrected Death Rate, whereas we were tenth in the List with a Death Rate of 12.9 per 1,000 in 1912. Full particulars of all the Boroughs in this respect are to be found in the table on pages 38 and 39. 12 The Infantile Mortality Rate for the Borough, measured by the number of deaths under one year to 1,000 births registered, was 103, an increase of 19 compared with last year; the figure for London as a whole was 105, and the Borough average during the last five years, 1908-12 inclusive, 108. The Zymotic Death Rate of 1.44 is 0 23 per 1,000 above the corresponding figure for last year. This increase in the Zymotic Death Rate is practicallv all accounted for by the larger number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Measles in Greenwich during the year. The figures relating to the different constituent parts of the Borough are as follows:— Districts. Birth Rate. Death Rate. Percentage of deaths under one year of age. Infantile Mortality per 1.000 Births. Zymotic Death Rate. Diarrhœa Death Rate. Consumption Death Rate.

Small-pox. Diphtheria. Scarlet Fever. Erysipelas. Typhoid Fever. Puerperal Fever.

Such temporary premises were obtained, suitably fitted up, a Tuberculosis Officer in the person of Dr. W. B. Hill was appointed, together with the necessary Staff, and the premises opened for the public on September 1st. Throughout the whole of the year, and up to the present time in the current year, search has been made for other premises which might be rendered suitable, or a plot of land upon which premises might be built, and at the present time a plot of land has been selected, and plans for the erection of suitable buildings have been forwarded to the Local Government Board for their approval. The question of dealing with Infant Diarrhoea during the hot weather has been under consideration practically throughout the whole of the year. No additional temporary Inspector was appointed this year, an endeavour being made to do the work by means of the present Staff; but it was found to be quite impossible to cope with it in this way, and at the present time,with a view to more thoroughly dealing with this matter during the current year, the Council have approved the appointment of a Health Visitor to devote herself entirely to visitation under Notification of Births Act and deal with Diarrhœa notifications in the summer months. The Infant Consultation in East Greenwich was opened in the beginning of June, since which time it has been carrying on very useful work under the Voluntary Committee of ladies as indicated last year. In conclusion I have again to tender my best thanks to each and all Members of the Council, and the Public Health Committee in particular, for their continued kindness and support, and also to the Members of the Staff for the manner in which their duties have been performed. I am, Gentlemen, Yours respectfully, ERNEST G. ANNIS. 14 VITAL AND MORTAL STATISTICS, 1913. POPULATION. The number of persons estimated to be living at the middle of the year is 96,01,5.

The Superintendent-Registrar of the Greenwich Union has kindly furnished me with the particulars relating to the number of marriages solemnized in the Parishes of Greenwich and St. Nicholas. The Superintendent-Registrar for the Woolwich Union has also kindly supplied the particulars for the Parishes of Charlton and Kidbrooke, with the exception, in these latter particulars, that none of the marriages performed in the Woolwich Registrar's Office and in Chapels in Charlton and Kidbrooke, of residents in those Parishes, are included. The following table shows these particulars, giving the number of marriages in Greenwich and St. Nicholas, etc., for each year since 1893.

The total number of Births in the Borough during the year lias been 2,528, but of these, 47 occurred in the Greenwich Union Infirmary, the address of the mother being in 27 instances in Deptford. Deducting these and adding 44 which were transferred from Lambeth, City of London, Lewisham, Poplar and Woolwich, it will be seen that the number of strictly Greenwich births for 1913 is 2,545, of which 1,324 were males and 1,221 females. This corrected figure gives a Birth Rate of 20-09 per 1,000 of the population, being 0 95 above the average for the last twelve years, 1901 to 1912, the period since the formation of the Metropolitan Borough. Amongst the total number of births registered in the Borough there were 69 in which the name of the father was not registered and therefore not given in the return; accordingly, these births may be presumed to be of an illegitimate character. 45 of such births were registered in the East Greenwich District, which includes the Infirmary of the Greenwich Union. [n 15 cases the mother was ordinarily a resident in the Borough of Deptford, and accordingly this number of births have been transferred to that Borough. The remaining 54 were similarly allocated to the districts in this Borough in which the mother ordinarily resided, making 23 of such births belonging to East Greenwich, 18 to West Greenwich, 4 to St. Nicholas, 8 to Charlton and 1 to Kidbrooke. The Birth Rate for the County of London equals 24.5 per 1,000 of the population. It varied from 9 2 in the City of London, 14.2 in the City of Westminster, 15.1 in Hampstead, and 16.7 in Holborn, up to 30.7 in Bermondsey, 30.8 in Bethnal Green, 31.0 in Southwark, 31.5 in Shoreditch and 32.0 in Poplar. Under the provisions of the Notifications of Births Act, 1907, intimations have been received from medical men, parents, and others, with respect to 2,623 births, from which it will be seen 35 that we have 78 intimations to be credited to births which were registered during the latter part of 1912, or will be registered during the early part of 1914, as the time allowed by law for registration purposes extends up to six weeks, whereas that under the Notification of Births Act is to be within 36 hours. DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered during 1913 was 1,396, of which 754 were males and 642 females. The crude Death Rate for the Borough of 14.31 per 1,000 compares with 14.2, the Death Rate for the County of London, and 14.3, the Death Rate for the 97 large towns. In the County of London the lowest crude Death Rates amongst the various Metropolitan Boroughs were 10.6 in Lewisham and Wandsworth, 10.7 in Hampstead, 12.5 in Fulham, 12.6 in Woolwich, and 12.7 in the City of Westminster; while the highest rates were 15.4 in Bethnal Green, 16.3 in Poplar, 17.4 in Southwark, 17.9 in Bermondsey, 18.3 in Finsbury and 18.6 in Shoreditch. Locally the Death Rate varied from 6.55 in Kidbrooke, 12.46 in East Greenwich, 12.75 in Charlton, 18.78 in St. Nicholas, to 18.81 in West Greenwich. The following table shows the variation in, and average of, the Death Rates in each of the five Districts of the Borough in the five years, 1907 to 1912, compared with the figures for 1913: — District. 1908. 1909. 1910. ! 1911. 1912.

Such persons had no known fixed residence in England, and, unfortunately, died in the "Dreadnought" Hospital. There were also two deaths of soldiers in the Herbert Hospital, whose addresses were given as South Africa and China respectively. From a consideration of the above total it will be seen that there has been a great increase in the number of deaths in West Greenwich District, which now includes the Seamen's " Dreadnought " Hospital, which Institution, up till this year, was included in the area of the East Greenwich District. Accordingly, if we deduct 2.07, the death rate in West Greenwich occasioned by the addition of the 48 deaths of sailors in the Seamen's Hospital,that will give the rate for West Greenwich as 16.74,which is comparable with the figures set out for the previous five years, showing that there has been an increase in the number of deaths of actual West Greenwich residents, but not so great as appears on the face of it, and if we add 1.02 to the figure for East Greenwich, as being the rate occasioned by these 48 deaths had they been, as previously, allocated to East Greenwich District, it would have given that District a rate of 13.48, which shows that that District also has really had an increase in its death rate during the year under consideration. 37 DEATHS IN INSTITUTIONS.

The Infantile Mortality, measured by the deaths of children under one year of age to the number of births registered, was 103 per 1,000 births, there having been a total of 263 such deaths during the year, as compared with 310, 259 and 200, the figures for the three preceding years. The number for the County of London was 105 per 1,000 births, the average for the past five years being 109 per 1,000 births. The average for the past five years in Greenwich has been 109 per 1,000 births, the greater portion of this increased fatality being due to the larger number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Measles. The following table gives the number and character of the intimations respecting births in the Borough since the adoption of the Notification of Births Act, 1907: — NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907.

I certainly think that this decision has not been arrived at a moment too soon, for the amount of ignorance displayed by many mothers respecting the care and nurture of young children is certainly appalling. This fact, I think, was particularly evident to the Public Health Committee when they considered a 41 report of the Female Sanitary Inspector concerning her visits to certain cases of Infantile Diarrhoea, in which she stated that: — "In this disease it is essential that the child should not be "given food of any description for at least twenty-four hours, "and to instil this into the minds of mothers at times seems "almost impossible. One instance will show the difficulty. "After having spent some considerable time one day in carefully "explaining to a mother how to make albumen and rice-water, "also leaving a leaflet for her general guidance, on the day "following I happened to be in the street, and accordingly "called in to see if the child had improved, when I was horrified "to find it sucking a piece of boiled pork. Another time, when "enquiring into a case of sickness, I found a child three years of "age, who had only been weaned a few weeks, had two days "previous to the onset of Diarrhoea been given some strawberries, "gooseberries, a green apple and hokey-pokey. The child, "becoming ill, was simply given a hard-boiled egg to attempt "to stop the diarrhoea. In a large number of instances I have "heard similar things. Another factor in the causation of this "sickness is probably due to the milk food of the child. Assum"ing that the milk is clean at the source of supply, the method "of delivery and storage leaves much to be desired. The milk, "after being carried around the streets for an hour or two, is "then very frequently, in the poorer neighbourhoods, put into "an uncovered can or jug (left purposely uncovered for the "convenience of the milkman) and deposited on the door-step, "thus allowing dust and germs from the roads to freely enter "and contaminate the milk. In many instances mothers have "expressed surprise when hearing that Diarrhoea was infectious. "In one house there was a series of three cases and two of the "children died." The lowest rates of Infantile Mortality amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs were 73 per 1,000 births in Hampstead, 78 in Lewisham, 79 in Woolwich, 82 in Stoke Newington, 88 in Wandsworth, and 90 in Chelsea, whilst the highest were 118 in Bethnal Green, 132 in Bermondsey, 138 in Finsbury, and 155 in Shoreditch. 42 Locally, the variations were from 40 per 1,000 births in Kidbrooke, 80 in Charlton, 103 in East Greenwich, 108 in West Greenwich, and 135 in St. Nicholas. The following table compares at a glance these figures for the years since the formation of the Borough: — District. Average for five Years. 1901-1905 inclusive.

All death causes are conveniently arranged under various headings, according to the Registrar-General's classification of diseases, and the following table, a summary of the larger table in the Appendix, shows the Death Rates for residents, and in fact all persons belonging to the Borough (although some of them may have died in Institutions in other Boroughs, or even outside the County of London altogether), per 1,000 of the population living in the Borough. 43 1913. 1913.

Infective Diseases. Epidemic. There were 156 deaths due to this class of diseases, equalling a Death Rate of 159 per 1,000; the rate last year was 126, and was 1.54 and 2 58 in 1910 and 1911 respectively. Zymotic. The purely Zymotic class of epidemic diseases is credited with causing a total of 140 deaths, equalling a Death Rate of 144 per 1,000. Locally, the Zymotic Death Rate varied from 0.00 in Kidbrooke (0.35 in 1912), 1.06 in Charlton (0.98 in 1912), 1.41 in East Greenwich (100 in 1912), 155 in West Greenwich (123 in 1912), up to 2.70 in St. Nicholas (3.31 in 1912). 44 Small-Pox. There were no deaths from this disease in 1913, this being the eleventh year since a death occurred from this cause in the Borough. Measles. Thirty-nine deaths were ascribed as due to this disease, 36 of the patients being under five years of age, and 3 between five and fifteen years of age, compared with 28 which occurred in 1912; 38, 16 and 40 deaths were recorded in the three preceding years. Twenty of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich, 8 in West Greenwich, 5 in St. Nicholas, and 6 in Charlton. The quarterly incidence was 10 in the first, and 21, 7 and 1 respectively in the succeeding quarters. Scarlet Fever. This disease occasioned 2 deaths, between the ages of five and fifteen years. One of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich and one in West Greenwich. Nine such deaths occurred in 1912 and three in 1911. Diphtheria. There were 12 deaths from this disease during 1913. This gives a Death Rate for Diphtheria of 012 comparing with 0.17, the rate for 1912. Sixteen deaths occurred in 1912 which were attributed to this cause, and 7, 18 and 16 in the three preceding years. Three of the patients were under five years of age, 1 of them dying in the Brook Hospital, and 9 of the patients were over live years of age, and of these 6 died in the Brook Hospital. There was a further number of 50 deaths from Diphtheria in patients not ordinarily resident in this Borough, but under treatment at the Brook Hospital. Nineteen tubes of Diphtheria Anti-toxin, containing a total of 76,000 units of serum, for the treatment of patients suffering from this disease, have been supplied by this Council during the year. Whooping Cough. This disease was given as the cause of 24 deaths in 1913, as against 30, 14 and 56 in the three preceding This Diagram gives in comparative form the Deaths from those Diseases which have caused the principal amount of Mortality during 1913. 45 years. These deaths equal a rate of 0.31 per 1,000. Eleven of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich, 6 in West Greenwich, 6 in St. Nicholas, and 1 in Charlton. Typhoid Fever. There were two deaths ascribed as due to this disease; there were 2 in 1912, 4 in 1911, 3 in 1910, 3 in 1909, 9 in 1908, and 5 each in 1907 and 1906. The deaths occurred in West Greenwich. Diarrhcea and Zymotic Enteritis. Sixty-one deaths were stated to be due to this cause, equalling a rate of 0-63 per 1,000. Last year there were 31 deaths, and 159, 35 and 34 respectively in the three preceding years. The deaths were distributed as follows:—Thirty in East Greenwich, 14 in West Greenwich, 9 in St. Nicholas, and 8 in Charlton. Six patients were over live years of age. This question of Diarrhoea has been extensively dealt with in previous pages in the Annual Report, notably in the introduction and under the heading of Infantile Mortality, so that repetition here will be unnecessary, and it only remains for me to say that I have great hopes that much good will be accomplished in this respect when the proposed permanent Health Visitor gets to work and obtains the confidence of the mothers in the district. Influenza. Influenza is found to have been the responsible cause for 10 deaths in 1913; 14 was the average of the previous three years. Of the 16, 7 were over sixty-live years of age. Sporadic Diseases. There were no deaths from this class of diseases during the year. Venereal. Syphilis. Eight deaths were given as due to Syphilis, as against 9 in 1912, and 7 in 1911. Of these 8 deaths, 5 were children under five years of age. One occurred in East Greenwich, 3 in West Greenwich, 2 in St. Nicholas and 2 in Charlton. One of the deceased persons was in the Greenwich Infirmary, 2 in the Seamen's Hospital and 3 in outside Institutions, 46 I have great hopes that when the proposed Municipal Bacteriological Laboratory in the Borough gets into working order we may be able to offer to medical men for patients living in the Borough facilities for having blood examinations made to assist in the diagnosis of cases of this serious disease. As a corollary I feel sure that the Council, when the necessity is placed before them, will see their way to granting facilities for special treatment in cases where it is absolutely necessary, but, at the same time, far beyond the patients' means to accomplish, on lines somewhat similar to those attempted and carried out so successfully with regard to the distribution of Diphtheria Anti-toxin. There were no deaths from Gonorrhoea during the year. Septic. Erysipelas. One death occurred from this cause in 1913, 1 in 1912, 5 in 1911 and 3 in 1910. Puerperal Fever. There were 2 deaths from this disease during the year. Pyaemia and Septicemia. There was 1 death from this disease during the year. Infective Endocarditis. No deaths were ascribed to this cause in 1913. The numbers were 2 in 1912, 2 in 1911 and 2 in 1910. Malarial. Rheumatic Fever. There were 6 deaths in 1913, as compared with 6 in 1912, none in 1911 and 4 in 1910. Rheumatism of the heart was the cause of 2 deaths, and Malarial Fever was the cause of 2 deaths. Tuberculosis. This class includes the causes of 141 deaths during the year under review, with a rate of 1.45; these figures compare with 172, 158 and 136, the totals of the previous three years, and respective rates of 1.80, 1.65 and 1.21. Tuberculosis of the Lungs (Consumption) is, as usual, credited with the major portion of these deaths, there being 112 attributed to this cause, or a rate of 1.5 per 1,000, comparing with T30 per 1,000, the Phthisis Death Rate for the whole of London. Amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs this Death Rate ranged from 0 57 in 47 Hampstead, 0.74 in Lewisham, 0.86 in Wandsworth, 0.93 in Stoke Xewington, up to 1.79 in Shoreditch, 185 in Southwark, 1.87 in Holborn, and 2 01 in Finsbury. Locally, the deaths were 2 in Kidbrooke, giving a Death Kate of 0.69; 10 in Charlton, giving a Death Kate of 0.59; 10 in St. Nicholas, giving a Death Kate of 135; 41 in West Greenwich, giving a Death Kate of 176; and 49 in East Greenwich, giving a Death Kate of 1.04 per 1,000. The remaining forms of Tuberculosis were responsible for 29 deaths, 9 being in East Greenwich, 12 in West Greenwich, 3 in St. Nicholas and 5 in Charlton. Of these other forms of Tuberculosis, Tuberculosis of the Brain or its Membranes was credited with 15, 10 being under live years of age; Tubercle affecting the Intestines, 4 deaths (1 being under live years of age); General Tuberculosis, 9 deaths (2 under and 7 over live); and other forms, 1. Parasitic Diseases. There were no deaths from this class of Disease. Dietic Diseases. There were 2 deaths from this class of disease due to Chronic Alcoholism in East Greenwich. Constitutional Diseases. The deaths from this cause were 159 in number, which gives a rate of 1.63 per 1,000. Of these, 138 were attributed to Cancer, 11 to Diabetes, 4 to Lymphadenonia, and 2 each to Osteo.Arthritis, Gout and Anaemia. The deaths from Cancer were distributed as follows:—58 occurred in East Greenwich, 34 in West Greenwich, 10 in St. Nicholas, 33 in Charlton, and 3 in Kidbrooke. Developmental Diseases. There were 253 deaths from this class of causes, equal to a rate of 2.59 per 1,000. These may roughly be divided into those from causes which would appear to be unavoidable, viz.:—Congenital defects, 9, and those from causes more or less preventable, Viz.: —Premature birth, 43; Injury at birth, 5; Debility at birth, 0; Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus, 27; Atelectasis, 9; and Dentition, 2. 48 The remaining and largest portion of these deaths from developmental diseases, 152 in number, were from Old Age; in 1912 there were 118 deaths from this cause, and 133 in the previous year. Local Diseases. Nervous System. One hundred and fourteen deaths were attributed to the various nervous diseases, which gives a rate of 1.17 per 1,000; last year the rate was 0.99 per 1,000. Convulsions were responsible for 10, 15 being under five years of age; 0 were from Meningitis, 50 from Apoplexy, 9 from Softening of the Brain, 4 from Hemiplegia or Brain Paralysis, G from General Paralysis of the Insane, 1 from other forms of Insanity, 1 from Chorea, 4 from Cerebral Tumour, 7 from Epilepsy, 1 from Laryngismus Stridulus, 1 from Locomotor Ataxy, 7 from Paraplegia, and 1 from the oilier diseases of t'his system. Organs of Special Sense. There were 3 deaths from this class of causes, equal to a rate of 0.03 per 1,000. Circulatory System. The Death Kate from diseases of this system was 1.72 per 1,000, there being a total of 168 such deaths. Valvular diseases of the heart were responsible for 144, 2 from Angina Pectoris, 6 from Aneurism, 1 from Senile Gangrene, 11 from Embolism, and from the remaining diseases of this system, 4. Respiratory System. Two hundred and thirty-five deaths were due to diseases ot: the respiratory organs, as compared with 218 in the preceding year. The Death Kate under this heading equals 2.41 per 1,000. Thirty-six were from Acute and 59 from Chronic Bronchitis; 123 from the various forms of Pneumonia, G4 being under five years of age, and 7 from Pleurisy, 4 to Emphysema, 2 to Laryngitis, 2 to other diseases of Larynx and Trachea, and 2 to other diseases.

Suffocation, by being overlaid in bed, was the cause of death of 8 children under live years of age (compared with only 1 from this cause last year); 4 cases were from drowning, while accidents on railways, in vehicular traffic and in building operations, falls, etc., were responsible for 36 deaths. The Suicides were by poison in 2 cases, 1 by cut or stab, 1 from Drowning, 1 from Hanging and Strangulation. Ill-Defined Causes. There was no death cause of which was not ascertained in 1913. 50 MORTUARY. The number of bodies dealt with in the Mortuary sinee 1806 is shown below:— Year. Drowned Bodies from River. Other Bodies.

Two hundred and sixty-one cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year, as compared with 254, 313, 160 and 155, respectively, in the four previous years. The distribution of these cases was as follows:—127 in East Greenwich, 5G in West Greenwich, 19 in St. Nicholas, 46 in Charlton, and 13 in Kidbrooke. Of this total number, 237 were removed to the Hospital for treatment. Amongst which number, the Hospital Authorities reported that in 10 cases they considered the diagnosis incorrect; 3 of the cases being thought to be Tonsilitis; 1 Membranous Laryngitis; 1 no disease whatever; and 5 not stated. There were 12 fatalities due to this disease, which gives a case mortality of 4.6 per cent. One thousand seven hundred and thirty-five specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from cases suspected to be Diphtheria. Of this number, 1,537 were reported to give negative or doubtful results, and 198 were positive in character, being dealt with accordingly. The quarterly incidence of the disease for 1913 has been as follows:— 1st Quarter—East Greenwich, 48 cases; West Greenwich, 17; St. Nicholas, 6: Charlton, 10; Kidbrooke, 3; a total of 84 cases. 2nd Quarter—East Greenwich, 28 cases; West Greenwich, 12; St. Nicholas, 3: Charlton, 11; Kidbrooke, 2; a total of 56 cases. 3rd Quarter—East Greenwich, 19 cases; West Greenwich, 13; St. Nicholas, 4; Charlton, 10; Kidbrooke, 4: a total of 50 cases. 4th Quarter—East Greenwich, 32 cases; West Greenwich, 14; St. Nicholas, 6; Charlton, 15; Kidbrooke, 4; a total of 71 cases. 57 Membranous Croup.—One case of Membranous Croup was notified during the year. Erysipelas. One hundred and six cases were notified during the year, 31 being in East Greenwich, 39 in West Greenwich, 26 in St. Nicholas, 8 in Charlton, and 2 in Kidbrooke. Six of these patients were removed to Public Institutions in the District. Scarlet Fever. Three hundred and twenty-eight cases were notified during the year, as compared with 435, 304 and 170 cases respectively, in the three preceding years; 175 cases were in East Greenwich, 63 in West Greenwich, 22 in St. Nicholas, 62 in Charlton, and 6 in Kidbrooke; 295 of these cases were removed to the Hospital for treatment. There were 2 deaths from this disease during the year as against 9 last year. Eight of the cases removed to the Hospital as suffering from Scarlet Fever were returned as wrongly diagnosed, i.e., 3 stated to be Rotheln, 1 Erythema and 1 Urticaria, no alternative disease being stated in the remaining 3 cases, while 7 patients on discharge were still suffering, 2 each from Chronic Rhinorrhoea, Intermittent Otorrhoea and Chronic Otorrhcea, and 1 from Albuminuria, and parents were duly notified of this. The following Table gives particulars of the six cases which would seem to be "return cases." There were 5 such cases in 1912, 7 in 1911, and 4 in 1910. 58 Table shewing Return Cases of Scarlet Fever during Year 1913. No. of Case. Date of Removal of Primary Case. Date of Disinfection.

There were 8 cases of Typhoid Fever notified during the year, 2 being in East Greenwich, 1 in West Greenwich, 4 in St. Nicholas, and 1 in Charlton. The ages of the patients were: 3 between five and fifteen years; 1 between fifteen and twenty-five years; and 4 between twenty-five and forty-five years. Of the total number of cases, 7 were removed to the Hospital for treatment. Ten such cases occurred in 1912, 10 in 1911 and 19 in 1910; the average number for the years 1901 to 1912, inclusive, being 34. There were two fatalities from this disease during the year in West Greenwich. Nine specimens were forwarded for bacteriological examination from cases suspected to be Typhoid Fever in character, and of this number, 7 gave a negative result, and 2 were positive. Puerperal Fever. Five cases of this disease were notified during the year, 3 in East Greenwich, 1 in West Greenwich, and 1 in Charlton. There were 5 cases in 1912, and 8 in 1911; 4 of these patients were removed to Hospital. There were 2 deaths from this disease during the year. Particular enquiries were made respecting the source of infection in each case, but in no way did there appear to be any common origin. Measles. Three hundred and forty-four cases of Measles were notified by school teachers and others during the year, as compared with 586 during the previous year, and 969, 795 and 497 in the years 1910, 1909 and 1908 respectively. The ages and incidence of fatality of the disease were as follows:—There were 112 cases under five years of age, amongst whom there were 28 deaths (8 being under one year), giving a case mortality of 25.8 per cent. Between the ages of five to fifteen years there were 232, with 3 deaths at this age period, giving a case mortality of 1.3 per cent. The case mortality for the whole district works out at 11.3 per cent. 60 Table shewing number of Measles Cases reported during the year 1913. 1st quarter.

This Council made an order requiring the notification of cases of Zymotic Enteritis or Summer Diarrhoea during the months of June, July, August and September. The order was duly advertised and came into operation for the months stated. The sections included in the order were Sections 55 and 57 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and under the provisions of these sections 462 cases of Diarrhcea were notified throughout the whole of the Borough, 184 being under one year of age; 224 between one and five; 21 between five and fifteen; 9 between fifteen and twenty-five; 16 between twenty-five and forty-five; 6 between forty-five and sixtv-five, and 2 over sixty-five. Two hundred and twenty-five of such notifications related to patients in East Greenwich, 124 in West Greenwich, 42 in St. Nicholas, and 71 in Charlton. Except in a portion of the district of Charlton and in St. Nicholas, in which district the local Nursing Societies assist in the visitation, no special visitation was carried out other than that of the Female Sanitary Inspector, who, during the summer months, gave this work her special attention, making 2,347 visits, finding it as stated elsewhere, to be entirely beyond the present resources of this Department to deal with in a satisfactory manner. There "were 61 deaths ascribed to this disease, comparing with .31 in the previous year. Whooping Cough. Five hundred and thirty-three cases were notified (compared with 525 in 1912), 98 being under one year of age, 284 from one to five; 148 from five to fifteen; 2 from fifteen to twenty-five; 1 between twenty-five and forty-five, the districts concerned being East Greenwich, 241; West Greenwich, 209; St. Nicholas, 43; Charlton, 38; and Kidbrooke, 2 (of which total number, 11 were treated in Institutions in the district). Each of these cases was visited and leaflets and instructions left together with verbal advice respecting the isolation and care of the patient, and at the conclusion of the illness the usual disinfection was carried out. Leprosy. In March, 1912, this Council passed the necessary Resolution, after giving the usual 14 days' notice, to the effect that 62 the Local Government Board should be asked for their approval to an Order making Leprosy notifiable in this Borough. Also the London County Council were approached with a view to making this disease notifiable throughout the County of London. A communication has been received from the Clerk to the London County Council stating that that Council has not sufficient evidence to warrant the inclusion of Leprosy in the list of notifiable diseases. They had, however, also brought the matter to the notice of the Local Government Board. Several of the Metropolitan Boroughs, also were in favour of the inclusion of this disease amongst the notifiable class, but up to the present, we have not heard definitely one way or the other from the Local Government Board on the subject. It certainly appears to me that the present time, when we are not aware of any case of this disease in the district, is a suitable one to press forward this question, in order to have the disease made notifiable, so that whenever a case does occur we should not have such difficulty in the future as was experienced on this last occasion. Epidemic Cerf.bro-Spinal Meningitis or Cerebro-Spixai Fever. No cases of this disease were notified during the year. Acute Polio-Myelitis or Acute Polio-Encephalitis. This disease was permanently added to the list of notifiable infectious, diseases during last year on an order of the London County Council approved by the Local Government Board. No case was notified during 1913. There were 2 cases in 1912. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. During the year 16 cases of this disease have been notified, 3 being in East Greenwich, 7 in West Greenwich, 4 in St. Nicholas, and 2 in Charlton, and have been dealt with by the nurses at the patients' homes, or in some cases as Out-patients at the Miller Hospital. Isolation Shelter. During the year 173 children have been, bathed and their clothes disinfected and hair attended to on 400 occasions, one of these children receiving this attention six times, 8 five times, 14 four times, 51 three times, 52 twice, and 63 47 once, under the arrangement with the London County Council for dealing with this matter. Contacts. No intimations were received from the Medical Officer of Health of the various Port Sanitary Authorities respecting persons who had been in contact with Small-pox, Plague or Yellow Fever. Glanders. Under the Glanders Order, notification has been made to this authority during the year with respect to three outbreaks of Glanders. Enquiries have been made, and no human Glanders has appeared to result therefrom. Glanders, Anthrax and Hydrophobia. No notification of any case of these diseases in man has been received during the year. Tuberculosis. During the year there were 384 cases of Tuberculosis notified in the Borough, 281 being pulmonary cases, or ordinarily known as Consumption, and 103 non-pulmonary,, being Tuberculosis affecting other portions of the body than the lungs. Of this number of cases, 119 Pulmonary and 41 Nonpulmonary occurred in East Greenwich, 70 Pulmonary and 28 Non-pulmonary in West Greenwich, 65 Pulmonary and 21 Nonpulmonary in St. Nicholas, 25 Pulmonary and 13 Non-pulmonary in Charlton, and 2 Pulmonary cases in Kidbrooke. The various ages of the patients were as follows:—Pulmonary cases, under one year of age, one case; from 1 to 5, four cases; 5 to 15, thirty-eight cases; 15 to 25, sixty-seven cases; 25 to 45, ninety-nine cases; 45 to 65, sixty-three cases; and 65 and upwards, nine cases; whilst the Non-pulmonary were—under 1 year of age, four cases; 1 to 5, twenty cases; 5 to 15, forty-nine cases; 15 to 25, eighteen cases; 25 to 45, seven cases; and 45 to 65, five cases. Of this number, 155 were removed to Institutions for treatment; 105 being Pulmonary cases, and 50 being Non-pulmonary cases. 64 Two hundred and sixty-six specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from patients suspected to be consumptive; 176 were reported to be negative and 90 positive. Disinfection has been offered and carried out in 86 cases, including 105 rooms and 253 articles of bedding, etc.; disinfectant has also been supplied to patients to disinfect sputum, etc., and sputum pots where such are found necessary. The following table shows the number and character of the notifications received under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, which were in force during January only of this year, after which date they were superseded entirely by the. Public Health Tuberculosis Regulations, 1912, which require in future that all cases of Tuberculosis, whether Pulmonary or Nonpulmonary, should be notified: — 1st Quarter (January only). 1st Notification. 2nd Notification. 3rd Notification.

Indicates notifications by District Medical Officers. C. Indicates notifications of patients' changes of address made by Superintendents of Poor Law Institutions. From which it will be seen that during the month there have been 15 patients notified, 11 of them being already in Poor Law Institutions, and 3 being patients outside such Institutions, concerning which patients we received 1 intimation of change of address. Much time and thought have been devoted, both by the Public Health Committee and the Officers, towards the preparation of a suitable scheme for dealing with the whole question of Tuberculosis in this Borough, and it may be opportune at this stage to place on record a brief resume of the position, showing the changes in its material features from time to time. After the Council had 65 originally decided upon the provision of a Tuberculosis Dispensary, the question of the Medical Staff for this Institution became a somewhat burning question in this district, the general medical practitioners realising that, should such a Dispensary become an accomplished fact, in a very short time, probably within 12 months, it would have a material effect to their disadvantage in so far as the treatment of patients in the Borough was concerned, and, at the same time, it would materially limit their opportunities for gaining practical experience in dealing with this insidious disease. Accordingly a scheme was evolved, which had the entire support of the medical profession in the neighbourhood, under which it was arranged that they should nominate certain local practitioners of approved skill and experience who would act in rotation as Tuberculosis Officers of this Institution. This scheme was formally approved by this Council and sent forward to the Local Government Board, who, however, took strong exception to the method of staffing the Institution, and in fact definitely disapproved the scheme on this ground. It was also suggested by that Board that we should again endeavour to arrange with the neighbouring Boroughs of Woolwich, Deptford and Lewisham for the purpose of securing a joint appointment of a properly-qualified wholetime Tuberculosis Officer for any two Boroughs. Enquiries were made on these lines, but it was found that no suitable working combination of this character could be effected, and accordingly it appeared to leave no alternative but to further consider the matter from the point of view of appointing a whole-time Tuberculosis Officer for Greenwich only, and the final scheme as approved by the Council, and also by the Local Government Board, is on the following lines: — That the Medical Officer of Health shall be the Chief Executive Officer, and that, under his administrative direction and control, a Medical Officer be appointed to take charge of the Tuberculosis Dispensary. That such Medical Officer should be a properly qualified medical man, and have had special experience in all modern forms of treatment of Tuberculosis, and must also have had practical experience in bacteriological laboratory work. The 66 Officer thus appointed shall have charge of the Tuberculosis Dispensary, and be entirely and personally responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of all patients presenting themselves at the Dispensary, and shall visit the homes in some cases for the purpose of keeping observation on his own patients, but not generally for domiciliary treatment. He shall also be available for c onsultations with general medical practitioners requiring such assistance. That a Dispenser should be appointed to live on the premises, and be responsible for the cleanliness of the same. That two Nurses should be appointed for this work, and that the tentative arrangements already made with the Ranyard Nurses' Association for the supply of such Nurses should be confirmed and acted upon. The estimate of the annual cost of the proposed Institution being as follows:— £ Medical Attendant (commencing salary) 350 per annum. Nurses 100 Rents, Rates and Taxes, etc. 50 Gas, Coal, etc. 20 Dispenser and Caretaker, with rooms, gas, coal, etc. 80 Drugs 90 Contingencies 10 Making a total of £700 „ As stated in the introduction to this report, after passing through many vicissitudes, we now have established a Temporary Tuberculosis Dispensary, together with the necessary staff, as outlined above. Dr. W. B. Hill being the first Tuberculosis Officer of that Institution, and his report upon the working of the Dispensary, from its opening on September 1st to the end of the year, I have much pleasure in submitting, as follows:— 67 TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. Report of Tuberculosis Officer for the period September 1st, 1913, to January 3rd, 1914. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I have the honour to submit the first report upon the work carried out at the Tuberculosis Dispensary. As the Institution was only opened to the public on the 1st September last, this account, representing as it does the work of the short period of four months only, must of necessity be brief and somewhat incomplete. It would seem advisable that I should at the onset give you a short account of the aim of the Dispensary, and the character of the work which is being carried out there. This may be enumerated under the two headings of " Treatment," and " Prevention." Treatment. 1. The examination of patients referred to the Dispensary from the undermentioned sources:— A. Cases notified by the Medical Officer of Health. B. Cases sent by Practitioners for Diagnosis, for treatment or for consultation only. C. Cases sent by voluntary charitable Institutions. D. Patients who voluntarily attend through the medium of existing patients. 2. Treatment of Patients suffering from Tuberculosis. A. Provision of open shelters. B. Selection of cases for Sanatorium, or Hospital, and for Open-air Schools. C. The "After Care" of patients discharged from toria. 68 The Prevention of Tuberculosis. 1. The examination of contacts from two sources. A. Existing Dispensary patients. B. Notified cases attended by Practitioners. 2. Visitation of patients at their own homes by the Dispensary Nurses for the purpose of supervision of treatment and education. Records are kept of their home conditions in the Public Health Department. 3. The supplying of Sputum Pots and the distribution of literature of an educative character. The prevention of the disease—undoubtedly the most important branch of the organisation against Consumption—is centred around the examination of the contacts of existing cases; and, in my opinion, if this work is to be efficient and far reaching in its results, not only those contacts definitely found to be the subjects of Tuberculosis must be actively healed, but the general health of the younger members of each family must receive attention. To my mind, it is impossible to emphasise this point too strongly. 1 cannot do better than quote the details of an actual case:— E.C. (Infected, 56) + Husband (56, uninfected). E.H. (35, Health poor) + A.H. (Husband, infected). E.H. (13) F.H. (11) A.H. (5) V.H. (6 mths.) Infected. * * * The members of the family starred are the contacts whose general health should receive medical care. The above case very well explains how important a part contact plays in the dissemination of the disease, the original infecting case, E.C., being in a chronic and advanced stage of the disease, whilst the remainder are at present in varying but less advanced stages of the condition. I have ventured into an arrange- 69 ment with the Authorities of the London County Council Openair School by which I reserve one afternoon a week on which to see children from that Institution. Advice is also given by the Dispensary Nurses, when visiting, as to the best methods to be adopted in the homes of the patients in order to lessen the chances of infection. As far as possible we endeavour to work amicably with the various Charitable Organisations in the Borough, and in several instances already considerable help has been rendered in the case of non-insured persons. Work of the Dispensary, 1st September to 27th December. During this period, 277 persons have attended for diagnosis, treatment or advice, and the subsequent attendance of patients numbered 1,204. The number of contacts examined total 208. This latter figure not only represents the contacts of Dispensary patients, but also those of cases which are under the care of local practitioners. An analysis of these figures gives the following facts:— Contacts examined. Found Tuberculous Suffering from other Lung diseases. 191 ... 20 ... 21 Divided into the various Districts. Contacts. Tuberculous. Other Lung: diseases. East Greenwich 76 5 13 West Greenwich 56 5 4 Charlton 20 5 2 St. Nicholas 39 5 2 191 20 21 So that 10.4 per cent. are found to be Tuberculous, and 10.9 per cent. to be the subjects of other Lung diseases, or to be in a very low state of health. In this connection, I would point out that in the routine examination of the younger contacts much valuable evidence will 70 accrue as to the lung conditions which are the direct result of Measles, Whooping Cough and Bronchitis in very young children. The cases represented by the percentage figure 10 9 are all of Pulmonary Fibrosis with Bronchiectasis, and each case furnishes the medical history of an attack of Measles, followed by either Bronchitis or Pneumonia, and, in turn, an attack of Whooping Cough. My figures are, however, too small as yet to justify any very general statements. Twenty-six cases have been primarily notified to the Medical Officer of Health by myself from the Dispensary. There are 126 patients' names on the register who have been in receipt of systematic treatment, viz.:— Males. Females. Children. Total. 30 38 58 126 Of these there are notified cases as follows: — Males. Females. Children. Total. 27 27 19 73 At the end of the current year there were 113 names on the Dispensary books of persons actually receiving systematic treatment, viz.:— Males. Females. Children. Total. 24 35 54 113 The difference, 13, was disposed of as follows:— Males. 1 Dead. 2 Infirmary—for economic reasons. 2 Sent to Sanatoria. 1 Too ill to attend. Females. 1 Sent to Hospital. 1 Advised by her own doctor not to attend. 1 Infirmary—for economic reasons. 71 Children. 2 Left the district, and have been put into communication with other Dispensaries. 2 Advised not to attend. Of the total having treatment there are:— 15 Males insured. 6 Females insured. There have been 21 consultations with practitioners. Additional treatment is being provided at various local and Metropolitan Hospitals in the undermentioned cases:— 1 Child for X-ray treatment. 1 Child for Finsen Lights. 1 Child for Finsen and X-ray. Tuberculin Treatment. The number of cases undergoing Tuberculin treatment is at present:— 3 Men. 4 Women. Up to the present the Diagnostic Tuberculin has not been used, for, from my experience, I do not consider it justifiable to inject patients with this preparation who are not under continuous observation during the reaction period, and my contention is borne out by Professor Studlemann (Berlin), who protests emphatically against Diagnostic injectures of old Tuberculin in out-patient work. The acquisition of observation beds, however, will overcome tins difficulty. At this stage, it seems advisable to point out that Tuberculin is not the Alpha and Omega of the crusade against Tuberculosis. Every case of Tuberculosis is not one for Tuberculin injection, and many cases can be injected with their own Tuberculin by means of graduated labour. 72 The Need for an After-Care Committee. I especially wish to call your serious attention to the need for the formation of a Committee to consider the " after-care " of patients who have been discharged from Sanatorium or Dispensary treatment. A great deal of the good obtained by Sanatorium treatment is entirely lost unless the patient has work to go to on his return to ordinary life. Again, I quote you an actual case to illustrate the importance of this point:— X.Y., aged 25. Onset of illness, 1910, whilst at work. Sanatorium treatment for five months in 1911, and discharged in September, 1911. He returned home, and apparently made no effort to obtain work, and "loafed" till June, 1913, when he visited a convalescent home for two months. He returned home, and was looked up by the Dispensary Authorities in September. He was febrile and was losing weight. Since this date he has had a modified course of graduated exercise at home, and now, since 8th December, has been earning 27s. a week as a fitter. Again, it is not in every case either desirable or possible for each patient to return to precisely the same class of work on discharge from Sanatorium as he was employed at before his term of treatment. Though many patients derive great benefit from Institutional treatment, yet, in the majority of the cases, they must be classed as " Maimed " lives, and work of a lighter character found for them. If this is not done relapse will inevitably ensue. I would suggest that the Committee be formed of members of the Public Health Committee, representatives of charitable organisations, and employers of labour. The good which could be done by such a Committee to prevent the development of the habitual Tuberculous loafer would be inconceivable. Dispensary Nurses. Two Curses are employed at the Dispensary, and during the past four months they have paid 222 primary and 886 secondary visits to the homes of Tuberculous patients. In addition to visiting, one Nurse is always on duty at the Dispensary during the hours of attendance of the Medical Officer. 73 Females. Number of Cases (35). Age Distribution.

HILL, Tuberculosis Officer. 77 From a careful perusal of this report I think everyone will realise what a most important part this Institution is likely to play in the immediate future in reference to the preventive work of this Department. I think all who give this subject a careful study from all points of view will realise that the preventive side of this Institution is the phase of its working which will most repay attention, for, whilst the curative side is being worked, yet one realises that the chief aim and object is to prevent the occurrence of fresh cases, and accordingly, as the preventive part grows and develops, the evidence of its usefulness will be seen in the decline of the curative part. When dealing with this question from the preventive side one is very speedily brought face to face with the fact that at the present time a great deal of money, time and effort is being uselessly expended in endeavouring to prevent the spread of this disease in poor families occupying poverty-stricken homes and containing one or more members in an advanced stage of this disease, who are in themselves, whilst remaining in such conditions, very active centres for the spread of the infection, and, in my opinion, as 1 have already on many occasions.pointed out, much more definite steps should be taken by the Poor Law Authority, or failing them, by some other authority, to ensure that such cases are permanently taken care of in what might be called " Homes of Rest." In this way it would give a far greater chance of success for all the measures of prevention that are exercised in connection with such families. There is also the question, which is mentioned by Dr. Hill in his report, which the Committee will remember was one of the earliest suggestions made by your Medical Officer of Health in this connection, namely, that a representative Committee should be formed to provide for the after-care of persons who had sufficiently recovered from an attack of this disease to enable them to obtain suitable employment and live in more suitable surroundings than those whence they had contracted the disease. School Clinics, Health Centres and Infant Consultations. We now have in Greenwich three separate Institutions of this character, one being chiefly a School Clinic conducted by Miss. 78 McMillan at Deptford Green, in St. Nicholas District, which is stalled by various able medical men, who are carrying out a large amount of work in connection with the treatment of ailments of school children, this Institution being maintained by voluntary subscriptions and a subsidy from the London County Council. In very close proximity to this Institution is also an Infant Consultation, held weekly, at the Albany Institute, under the auspices of the Deptford Fund. This Institution was opened at the beginning of the year, and for the first few weeks, until definite arrangements had been made, was attended alternately by Dr. Whitehouse, Medical Officer of Health for Deptford, and myself. In April, however, a definite arrangement was made with Dr. Crabbe for him to attend the Consultation regularly; and since this time, until the end of December, there was a total attendance of 1,020 mothers. Total number of consultations with the medical man, 743; total number of infants weighed, 969. These entries are taken from the weekly register, in which individual case records are kept. The attendance of mothers has increased from 84 per week in April to 177 in December, and the consultations from 38 to 155 in the same time, thus showing how much the work is appreciated in this district. In connection with the Albany Institute, there is also a Babies' Residential Home having six cots and three resident trained Nurses in charge. To this home the medical attendant at the consultation sends any sickly or underfed babies whom he thinks desirable. There is also a large nursery attached, where babies can be left at a charge of 2d. per day when the mothers are ill or at work. From my personal experience of the Institution, and observation of the results in the home, I can definitely state that this work is doing a great deal of good in this immediate neighbourhood. It was further realised that, as this Institution was situated almost at the Borough boundary, one could not expect mothers from the other end of the Borough to come so far, and accordingly, during Health Week, a meeting of representative ladies, of those interested in such work, was convened and a Representative Committee was formed to start an Infant Consultation Centre in East Greenwich. This Centre was opened on June 4th, 1913, at the "Conlduit House Club," which is thus 79 quite centrally situated. A Medical Attendant was appointed to attend regularly and see any infants who needed his supervision. For this service, a small honorarium is paid. One or two of the ladies of the Committee attend weekly, according to a rota arranged among themselves. Miss Davis, the Female Sanitary Inspector, also attends each week, and, by arrangement, one or other of the District Nurses for the neighbourhood. Since the opening of the Consultation, until the end of the year, there has been a total number of attendances of over 550 babies, who have been weighed, and the mothers advised as was deemed requisite in connection with the health of the child. Should any children appear to the Medical Attendant to be in need of special medicament, such as Cod Liver Oil Emulsion, Parrishes' Food, any of the simpler ointments, etc., and in the warm weather " Trumilk," arrangements have been made so that any of these articles are supplied at a very reduced cost, the balance of the cost being paid by the funds of the Institution. Towards the first year's working of this Institution a grant of £50 has been very kindly made by the Women's Imperial Health Association, and arrangements are in progress whereby any deficit mqy be made up by means of voluntary contributions. Should any baby or parent appear in need of further material assistance, one of the ladies of the Committee is asked to specially visit the home, make any necessary enquiries, and to that lady is entrusted the duty of seeing that adequate relief is obtained from one of the Charitable Agencies in the Borough. In this way it will be seen that an endeavour is being made to hold out the hand of kindly, helpful sympathy to those of the poorer classes in our midst who are deserving of special help in any time of unusual difficulty, and this help, dispensed with the care that it has been in the past, has been much appreciated by those upon whom it has been bestowed. 80 HOUSES INSPECTED AND ENQUIRIES MADE IN CONNECTION WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Excluding Measles. Number of Houses Inspected and Enquiries made 1,245 Number of Revisits 6,603. Forty-five rooms have been cleansed after disinfection by the Department. The undermentioned Schools have been disinfected, owing to the prevalence of infectious disease amongst the children attending:— January—Holy Trinity (1 room), Diphtheria. September—Invicta Road (2 rooms), Scarlet Fever. During the year, when premises have been entered for the purpose of carrying out disinfection after cases of Infectious Disease, the following books belonging to the Libraries, etc., were destroyed:— Central Library, 32; Branch Library, 15; School Libraries, 14; Total, 61. 81 Number of Articles and Rooms Disinfected in connection with the Undermentioned Diseases for the 53 weeks ending 3rd January, 1914.

The Tables on pages 102 to 106 summarise, as far as possible, the Sanitary work of the Department; from this it will be seen that a total of 14,888 houses and premises have been inspected or reinspected during the year; 1,360 intimation notices have been served, and 461 statutory notices. With the exception of prosecutions in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, it was not found necessary to institute Police Court proceedings in any case during the year. There were altogether throughout the year 447 complaints entered in the Public Complaints Register of the Department; these were in each case carefully investigated, and any necessary action immediately taken; thus there are none of these matters left outstanding or unattended to. Bakehouses. One hundred and eighty inspections have been made of the various Bakehouses in the Borough, and 60 nuisances found therein have been abated as the result. Factories and Workshops. Three hundred and thirtv-four inspections have been paid to these premises within the Borough during the year. There were 281 workshop premises on the Register at the beginning of the year, 9 have been added during the year, and 35 have been taken off, leaving a total now on the Register of 255. This total includes 20 laundries, 43 dressmaking and mantle works, 8 fuel and firewood works, 3 cycle works, 8 milliners, and various others, including workplaces, such as 5 blacksmiths, 13 barge builders, 5 builders' yards, etc. Information has been sent to H.M. Inspector of Factories with respect to 1 new workshop. No complaints have been received from H.M. Inspector, and only 3 intimations respecting alleged new workshops. Outworkers' Register. Sixty-four lists of Outworkers, containing 240 names and addresses, have been received during the year from the Medical Officers of Health for other Districts; 35 lists, containing 208 names, have been received from employers 84 "within the District; 33 lists, containing 101 names, have been forwarded to other Districts, thus giving a total of 347 names and addresses of outworkers within the Borough. One hundred and twenty-eight visits of inspection have been 'made to these premises. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, LAUNDRIES, WORKPLACES and HOMEWORK. 1.— INSPECTION. Premises. Number of Inspections.

The slaughter houses in the Borough have been inspected on 39 occasions by the Inspectors. 88 Cowhouses. The four cowhouses in the Borough have been visited on 17 occasions, and the required cleansing has been duly enforced on 11 occasions. Horse Slaughterer. The one horse-slaughtering house in the Borough has been visited by the Inspector on 20 occasions, and cleansing of the premises was required on 4 of these visits. Other Scheduled Offensive Trades. The premises where these offensive trades are carried on within the precincts of the Foreign Animals Wharf have been visited occasionally, but, as the supply of animals to that Wharf has been only of a very limited character, the work carried on also has been almost nil. Effluvium Nuisances. From time to time during the past two or three years serious complaints have been received respecting objectionable smells emanating from certain trade premises on the River Bank. These smells are occasioned by the burning of old metal, rubbish, etc. The old metal consists of tins and cans which have contained paint, varnish, oil and similar commodities, also waste of all descriptions, containing scraps of leather, rubber and similar material. At the time of the actual burning of this material much nuisance has been occasioned to the inhabitants of houses in the immediate neighbourhood, the site where the burning was carried on being in a large yard enclosed on three sides by small property. Representations were made by the owners and occupiers of the premises from time to time, and many promises were made that this nuisance should be discontinued. A petition was presented signed by a large number of the inhabitants in the neighbourhood, and it was decided to keep the premises under observation with a view to taking proceedings in regard to the specific instances when this nuisance occurred, under Section 21 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which states as follows: — "Where any manufacture, building or premises used for any trade, business, process or manufacture causing effluvia is certified to the Sanitary Authority by their Medical Officer of Health to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health of any of the 89 inhabitants of the district, the Authority shall make a complaint, and if it appears to the Petty Sessional Court hearing the complaint that the trade, business, process or manufacture carried on by the person complained of is a nuisance, or injurious or dangerous to health of any of the inhabitants of the district, then, unless it is shown that such person has used the best practicable means for abating the nuisance, or preventing or counteracting the effluvia, the person so offending shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £50." As the days and times when this nuisance was created were very variable, many futile visits and observations had to be made, but on the occasion of a visit before 6 a.m. one morning, the burning was found to be in progress, and the nuisance occasioned at the time was very great and serious, so much so that, although it was a nice, fine September morning, yet the occupants of the surrounding houses had perforce to keep all their windows securely shut in order to obviate as much as possible the entrance of the smoke, smells and fumes into their houses. Accordingly, your Medical Officer of Health certified as required under this Section, and reported the matter to the Public Health Committee, with a view to proceedings being taken according to this Section. On fully considering the matter, however, the Committee decided that they would accept the responsibility, and no proceedings should be taken at any rate on this occasioin, the Medical Officer of Health being directed to write a further warning letter to the proprietors of the business, requesting them not to cause any further nuisance and discomfort to the occupiers of the surrounding property. Serious complaints still continue to be received repecting offensive smells emanating from the main sewers and tramway conduits of the London County Council, as they pass along the main roads of the Borough, and a complaint was made to the Home Office by this Council on the subject. The Home Office apparently asked the London County Council for some explanation of this condition of things, whereupon the London County Council took this matter into their serious consideration. A Conference 90 between members of the Main Drainage Committee of the London County Council and the Public Health Committee of this Council was arranged, when an agreement was come to that for the present this Council should take no further action in pressing their complaint upon the Home Office, if the London County Council, in two or three selected spots in the Borough, erected suitable safety-valve ventilating columns. Arrangements are being made to this end, and this experiment will be watched with particular care and interest during the coming summer, and it is to be hoped that at the times—particularly just before a thunderstorm, or when the barometer is falling rapidly—when these objectionable emanations from the sewer are most evidenced these safety-valve apertures at the top of tall ventilating columns will provide sufficient outlet for the gases from the sewer at a sufficient distance above the surface of the ground, so that the nuisance will not be so objectionable and serious. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order. At the commencement of the year there were 166 premises on the Register of Dairies and Milkshops; 5 new applications have been received during the year and added to the Register, and 11 names have been taken off, thus leaving a total of 160 premises now registered. During the year 200 visits of inspection have been paid to these premises; notices were served upon the occupiers in 14 cases, 4 of which were for dirty premises generally, in 5 cases for dirty milk vessels and utensils, 1 for want of proper covering for milk receptacles, and in 4 instances for general insanitary conditions. Under the powers conferred by the London County Council (General) Powers Act, 1908, Section 5, with respect to the registration of premises unsuitable for the sale of milk, such registration has been refused on the grounds of the unsuitability of the premises in 3 cases. Ice Cream Premises. There were 125 premises known at the commencement of the year where the manufacture of this commodity was carried on; 13 have been added during the year and 21 taken off, leaving a total of 117 premises. These premises were 91 inspected on 124 occasions, and improvements required either by way of cleansing of the premises in 8 cases and remedying of sanitary defects in 1 case, and no ashpit in 1 case.

Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. Three applications with respect to 21 tenements were received during the year for certificates under these Acts, but no certificate was granted, for the alterations required were not carried out by the applicant. Housing of the Working Classes. Premises have been found to be overcrowded in 33 cases, which have all been abated. Two hundred and twelve houses have been generally repaired; 275 premises have been cleansed, lime-washed, and repaired; 122 have 92 been improved as regards their ventilation; 164 premises have had the walls and ceilings cleansed throughout, and 255 premises have been partially cleansed; leaky house roofs and gutters have been repaired in 319 cases; 86 staircases have been improved and ventilated; nuisances from dampness have been abated in 146 cases; dampness of walls-have been remedied in 126 cases; direct connection between the internal sanitary fittings of houses and the drain have been disconnected, trapped and amended in 267 cases; similarly 35 stack pipes have been disconnected, trapped and amended; 3 houses have been abolished as unfit for habitation; and other nuisances, principally of dilapidations and want of underfloor ventilation, have also been attended to in 40 cases. During the year 397 houses in this district have been inspected under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, the records of such properties being duly filed. Of this number, nuisances or defects were found in 350 cases, concerning which houses the necessary notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were served. Of these 350 houses thus dealt with, in 7 cases the landlord voluntarily elected to close the property instead of complying with the notices, and 4 of these were demolished. In 270 cases the notices were satisfactorily complied with, leaving 73 cases still in hand or otherwise undisposed of at the end of the year; 17 houses closed in previous years were demolished voluntarily during 1913.

Out of a number of such premises which have been reported to the Committee, it has been decided during 1913 to register 5, which, together with the 238 on the register at the end of 1912, gives a total of 243 premises on the Register of Houses let in Lodgings at the end of the year. Two hundred and seventy-three visits of inspection were paid to these houses during the year, which brought to light the necessity of cleansing, etc., as set out below, as required by the By-laws, in 100 cases, whilst under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, cleansing, etc., was required in 48 cases, as set out below:— Houses closed, 3. Number of notices served for cleansing of houses under the By-laws:— Rooms Cleansed 80 Staircases and Passages Cleansed 11 Water Closets Cleansed 4 Overcrowding 3 Insufficient Ventilation 2 100 Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— Cleansing Without Ash Bin 18 Water Closets Blocked and Water Fittings Defective 15 Water Closets Dirty 4 Sink Waste Defective and Blocked 1 Roof Defective 2 Insufficient Ventilation Defective Guttering, etc. 2 Verminous Rooms 3 Stairs Defective 1 Yard Paving Defective 2 48 94 Number of Inspections of Registered Houses 273 Number of Notices Served 51 Re Particulars of Registration 27 Re Registration 16 Other Matters referred to Inspectors 20 House Drainage. Two hundred and eighty-nine house drainage systems have been reconstructed; 254 such systems have also been opened, cleansed and amended; 20 new systems and 213 surface drains have been constructed; 167 drains and soil pipes have been ventilated, 201 systems have been tested by smoke and 308 by water, of which number 243 were found to be defective; 81 new soil pipes and 372 traps have been fixed, together with 84 intercepting chambers and 10 other chambers. Three cesspools have been abolished; 35 areas, 140 yards, and 1 mews and stable have been thoroughly drained. Thirty-four water-closets have been erected; a pan, trap and water supply have been furnished throughout in 216 cases, and other fittings in 277 cases, whilst the water supply has been renewed in 99 instances. The water supply for lavatory purposes has been disconnected from the drinking water system in 16 instances. Public-house urinals have been cleansed and repaired in 45 instances, and 4 urinals were altered. Periodical flooding of the houses in the lower lying parts of the Borough still continues, and on the last occasion it was practically worse than it has been on any previous flooding. From these occurrences one can only judge that the new main sewers which have been put in by the London County Council during the last few years are only in themselves sufficient to cope with the normal condition of things, and have not sufficient margin to deal with heavy storms and exceptional occasions when they arise. Refuse Removal. New ash receptacles have been provided in 462 cases, and 7 complaints on this subject have been forwarded to the Surveyor for his attention. Offensive Trade Refuse. The arrangements entered into with Messrs. Hempleman & Co., of West Ham, still continue to work very satisfactorily. 95 Public Sanitary Conveniences. The Public Sanitary Conveniences, Urinals, Fountains and Horse Troughs situated within the Borough are the same as last year, with the addition of a Drinking Fountain erected in the Creek Road, not far from the Deptford Cattle Market, as a Memorial to the late George Philcox, who was for so many years Superintendent of that Market. Water Supply. The water supplied throughout the whole of the district by the Metropolitan Water Board still maintains its high standard of purity. During the year 99 water supply certificates have been granted under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; these certificates stating that the new houses to which they refer are supplied with a proper water supply in accordance with the Act. Defective water fittings have been renewed in 134 cases; 10 water supplies have been reinstated where the supply had been cut off; water fittings have been amended in 111 cases; 73 water supplies have been altered so as to draw direct from the main; the cleansing, repairing and covering of cisterns has been required in 18 cases. Smoke Nuisances. One hundred and seventy-four observations have been taken for smoke nuisances during the year, but on only 5 occasions was it found necessary to issue Statutory Notices for the abatement of any nuisance which was found. The Rag Flock Act, 1911, came into operation on July 1st, 1912, and under its provisions samples of rag or flock used in the various branches of upholstering work are to be taken to see that they do not contain more than 30 parts chlorine, in the form of chlorides, in 100,000 parts of flock, as set out in the Regulations made under Section 1 of that Act. No samples have been taken under the provisions of this Act during the year. Food and Drugs Act. Four hundred and thirty-five samples have been purchased under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, of which 420 were certified to be genuine and 15 adulterated, the 96 adulterations thus being equivalent to 3 per cent, of the samples taken. Of the total number of samples purchased, 126 were butter, of which all were genuine; 171 were milk, of which 11 were certified to be adulterated; the remaining adulterated samples were 1 of coffee and 3 of vinegar. Of the. 126 samples of butter taken during the year, 90 contained boric acid preservative, the amount in each case not exceeding 0 5 per cent. Milk and Cream Regulations. No spccial samples have been taken under the express provisions of these Regulations, but all samples of milk taken during the year under the provision of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts have been examined for preservatives, which have not been found up to the present on any occasion. As required by the Local Government Board, the following Schedule is appended:— 97 Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1913. 1. Milk and Cream not sold as Preserved Cream.
