THE MEDICAL OFFICER REPORTS AS FOLLOWS,— The annexed Tables represent the Sickness and Death-movements during the year which terminated on the last day of 1861, and during the quarter terminated on the 29th March, 1862. During the year 1861, 3177 deaths and 4864 births were registered. The aggregate deaths of the preceding six years are expressed in the following series: 2998, 2719, 2955, 3180, 2922, 2970. If allowance be made for a gradually and rapidly increasing population, these figures, which in themselves vary but little, represent a considerable yearly fall in the rate of mortality. Assuming the population of Shoreditch to have been for the whole year 1861, what it was ascertained to be on the 8th April, the date of the Census, the death-rate would be nearly 1 in 40, or 24.8 per 1000, or a little less than 2.5 per centum. The mortality throughout the metropolis was 2.32 per centum. This comparison would indicate that the mortality in Shoreditch exceeded the general metropolitan rate. It would be no discredit to a district comprising far beyond the average proportion of the poorer classes, were this excess real; but it is in great part at least, apparent only. Within the Shoreditch Registration-District are comprised an unusual number of Alms-houses, the last refuge of aged persons, before they drop into the grave. The district also contains the Parish Workhouse, with its Infirmary and Fever-Hospital. In this institution the aged-poor are lodged, whilst the young children, who form the healthy residue that has survived the perils of infancy, are drafted off to Brentwood. The population is thus charged with an undue proportion of persons at the two extremes of age when the expectation of life is least. In addition to these disadvantages, the district includes the Parish Workhouse of St. Luke's, which burdens the Shoreditch-mortality with an element altogether foreign. If this latter element be subtracted, the mortality is reduced to 2.3 per centum, in fact to the metropolitan rate. But the 16 metropolitan rate is made on a population estimated for the middle of the year, and not on the enumerated population on the 8th April. Applying the same rule to Shoreditch, it will be necessary to raise the population by one-fourth of its annual rate of increase. This will give a population of 129,829; and will reduce the death-rate below 1 in 43, and below the gross metropolitan rate. In the Report for the year 1860, I gave a tabular view of the death-rates in Shoreditch for the six years 1855—1860; year by year the rates stand as follows:—1 in 39, 1 in 40, 1 in 35, 1 in 38.6, 1 in 43, 1 in 43. The latter most favorable rate was sustained in 1861. We have, then, the testimony of two leading statistical tests speaking in favour of the progressive amelioration of the sanitary condition of the district. These are: firstly, a steadily progressive diminution in the death-rates during a series of years, concurrently with sanitary administration; secondly, an absolute moderate mortality sustained during a period of three years. These are the great facts, resulting from the simple comparison of the gross mortality with the gross population, and setting aside all analytical inquiry into the minor elemental features of the problem. We pass on to the subsidiary tests supplied by the study of the relative mortality at different ages, and of particular causes of death. Ages at Death.—Of 1581 deaths of males, 848 occurred in children under the age of 5 years; and of 1596 females, the deaths under 5 years were 722. It thus appears, that whilst 53 per centum. of all the male deaths happen under 5 years old, the proportion of infant female deaths is only 46 per centum. In both sexes the proportion is 49 per centum, or just below one half. The proportion is heavy. But we have no accurate standard that will enable us to determine the relative increase or decrease in the proportion of infant deaths. The mode of dealing with "Still-births" may materially affect the mortality tables. A still-birth is not registered. But if the theory be now more generally adopted amongst medical men, that the act of breathing is not the only essential sign of life, then will a greater number of infant deaths appear upon the register than in former years. Still it must continue to be a subject demanding anxious study to trace the causes that assail infant life, with a view to their removal. These causes will be seen by referring to the second and third columns of Table I. 17 In last year's report I gave a table exhibiting the numbers of the population in each of the six Registration Sub-Districts, as determined by the recent census. To that report I must also refer for other facts and considerations connected with the population. The Births and Deaths in the Sub-Districts are exhibited in Table III. During the year there were registered 2347 male births, and 2517 female births, making a total of 4864 births. The male deaths amounted to 1581, the female deaths to 1596, making a total of 3177. The excess of 1687 births, probably, does not represent the total increase of population. All the births are not registered, and the balance between emigration and immigration cannot be ascertained. Table IV. is a summary of the census of 1861, exhibiting the number of houses inhabited, uninhabited, and in process of building, the number of separate families, and the number of male and female individuals in each Registration Sub-District. In 1851. the gross population was 109,257, the number of inhabited houses 15537. The increase of population therefore in ten years, was more than 20,000; and the increase of inhabited houses to receive this increment of population was 1873. Particular Causes of Death.—Occupying the first place in the rank of causes of death is Phthisis, which destroyed 361 persons; this fatal disease thus accounts for more than 10 per centum of all the deaths. Closely associated with Phthisis in nature, and ranking third in frequency, stand the class of Scrofulous diseases. These carried off 311 persons, chiefly children. If these allied diseases, Phthisis and Scrofula, be added together, we find that they explain more than one-fifth of the aggregate mortality. This proportion somewhat exceeds that observed during the preceding year. It must be remembered that, whilst these diseases are largely due to the operation of hereditary transmissions, their prevalence and fatality are much increased by bad nourishment, and by impure air especially by that form which results from overcrowding. These diseases therefore, like Fever, and other zymotic or epidemic diseases, become sanitary tests, and point to distinct causes of unhealthiness. Next in the order of destructiveness, we find the two forms of lung-inflammations, Bronchitis, which carried of 332 persons, chiefly adults, and Pneumonia which carried off 207 persons, chiefly children. These two diseases 18 together, contribute 16 per centum, or one-sixth to the whole mortality Although inflammation of the lungs, or one of the forms of lung-disease registered under the terms, pneumonia and bronchitis, owe, in the majority of cases, their immediate origin to the influence of cold, yet many causes more or less remote, concur in their production. These causes it is not always possible to unravel. Bronchitis especially is a name given to a condition, in which various, perhaps, complex diseases terminate. Frequently this condition is only a mode of dying, not strictly an essential disease, or cause of death. Both bronchitis and pneumonia also have their sanitary aspect,—one more important, I believe—than is commonly suspected. In many instances, these are not simply local disorders, that is, not mere lung-inflammations, but really the consequences of some morbid poison circulating throughout the system. Pneumonia and bronchitis may be as truly the result of epidemic influences as fever or scarlatina, or diarrhoea,. If these names, therefore, obtain an excessive prominence in mortality-tables, attention must be directed to the sanitary conditions of the locality. Pneumonia and bronchitis were considerably less fatal in 1861 than in 1860. The difference is not perhaps entirely explained by the prevalence of greater mildness of temperature. Brain- diseases occupy the next place. If we class together the three heads, brain-disease, apoplexy, and convulsions, we get a sum of 403 deaths. This is equal to 12 per centum of the gross-mortality. The term "Convulsions" is one of the most ambiguous in the Register. It covers a vast amount of gratuitous assumption; convulsions frequently occur as the last symptom of other diseases; it is one of those terms used by uninformed persons under the assumed necessity for giving some name to a fatal disease. It constitutes one of the principal fallacies of the Registration-Returns. A large proportion of infant deaths which passed without medical observation, are registered under this convenient denomination. Very similar remarks will apply to the next accepted causes of death: Atrophy, and Debility. These are vague terms, employed for the most part for the want of precise knowledge. Under these heads, 151 deaths almost entirely of infants and aged persons, are registered. In the next place stands Diarrhoea, which this year produced only a moderate mortality. 149 deaths are ascribed to this cause. Old Age is ascribed as the cause of death in 130 cases. Amongst these, were several instances of remarkable longevity. Heart Diseases come 19 next: 127 deaths are put down to this class. Then follows WhoopingCough, which carried off 124 children. Then Fever, which was fatal to 110 persons. This number, abstraction being made of 12 cases which occurred in St. Luke's Workhouse, only slightly exceeds that of the preceeding year. Upon this disease, one of the acknowledged sanitary tests, some observations are necessary. It is well known that fever prevailed extensively throughout the Metropolis and in many parts of the Country during the winter and the spring of 1862. It is essential in the first place, in reference to the recent epidemic, to bear in mind the distinction between Typhus fever and Typhoid fever. Cases of both are almost necessarily registered under the same term. The word "fever," also, as used in the Registration of Deaths, is often applied to cases which have nothing of an epidemic character. For some years past, the fever which has prevailed in London has been Typhoid. It is this form which, there is reason to believe, is most closely associated with defective sewerage, with the ingestion of sewage-matters conveyed into the system either by the water we drink, or by the air we breathe, or by other means. This kind of fever is not endowed with very active infectious properties. It is chiefly propagated by the direct imbibition, either by the lungs or by the stomach, of the germs discharged from the alimentary canal of other fever patients. Absolute cleanliness, carried out in all the details of purification of the air, of dwellings, of clothes, of removal or disenfection of animal excreta, of cleanliness in eating and drinking, would in all probability abolish the disease. The diminution of it, has indeed, kept pace with remarkable uniformity, with the progress of sanitary improvement. As regards Typhoid Fever, recent experience offers no contradiction to this proposition. But the other kind of fever, the Typhus which has been prevalent during the winter and spring is very contagious. It is apt to be propagated from person to person, and to spread throughout a household or a community, with a facility approaching that which characterises scarlatina. Although there is reason to suspect in some cases an association between typhus and sewage-poisons, it is more especially the disease of Overcrowding, and Destitution. Wheresoever, people are exposed to the combined influence of bad and insufficient food, and of air loaded with the impurities resulting from animal life, there a state of blood is likely to be induced which issues in the development of typhus fever. Such was the Famine-Fever of Ireland. Originating in 20 this manner, it acquired a highly contagious power. So in London it has arisen chiefly amongst the most destitute of the population. Thus, the Refuge for the Destitute in the neighbouring parish of St. Lukes' was, for many months, literally a depot of typhus. Many cases were drafted from thence to St. Luke's Workhouse, and no doubt, some cases belonging to Shoreditch were the result of importation, brought about by the vagrant habits of the destitute class amongst whom the disease prevailed. It is patients suffering from this kind of fever, whom it is especially desirable to remove from their unhealthy dwellings to the well-aired wards of the Workhouse Fever Infirmary. This is one of those forms of disease which occasion the most anxiety in the future to thoso whose duty it is to watch over the public health of the metropolis. Drainage, and the other ordinary sanitary works may be steadily, and to a certain point effectually, made to meet the requirements of the population; but no ordinary vigilance or legislative powers will always bo sufficient to obviate the constant tendency of town populations to accumulate in small spaces. The most practicable remedy, although often a merely palliative one, against the evil of overcrowding, lies in securing full ventilation of houses and rooms. An effectual hindrance to the application of this remedy is constantly arising in the want of space at the backs of the houses. The construction of houses back-to-hack, so as to preclude the possibility of through-ventilation, will, it is hoped, be not again tolerated. The number of tenements of this description is happily diminishing. Rut there is still danger of the construction of houses with so little space in the rear, that the impediment to the circulation of air, and the access of light, amounts to a very serious evil. Without an extent of domiciliary controul, which the most ardent and despotic sanitarian cannot contemplate as possible to exercise, we cannot hope to maintain the constant observance of a standard number of cubic feet of room for each inmate of a dwelling. But it is quite possible by legislative measures to secure what is better; and that is, a sufficient clear space in the rear of each new house to allow of ventilation and light. There is no sanitary measure that promises more towards mitigating the double danger arising from the crowding of families in small rooms, and from the concentration of masses of population on small areas than this of ensuring a sufficient space at the back and front of each house. The minimum horizontal or 21 garden space at the back of a house compatible with adequate ventilation cannot be taken at less than the area of the elevation. In the next rank are classed Lung Diseases, comprising mostly chronic affections distinct from inflammations. Under this head are ranged 79 deaths. Scarlatina was fatal to 71 persons. In 1860 the deaths from this cause were 73; and in 1859, 185. Measles was fatal to 56 persons, as compared with 90 in 1860, and with 39 in 1859. The causative connection between scarlatina and measles, and sewage-poison in an aerial form, is a subject concerning which, I have been gradually led to form an increasingly confident opinion. It is very satisfactory to observe that notwithstanding the growing concentration of the population these diseases do not increase in fatality. 68 deaths were the result of premature birth; and 11 more of malformations incompatible with life. 62 deaths were traced to violence in various forms, exclusive of 3 cases of poisoning; and of 10 of drowning. Most of these cases were the subjects of Coroners' inquests. 135 persons died from the effects of various local disorders of the stomach, liver, kidneys, or other organs. 7 deaths are attributed to alcoholic poisoning; but these are very far indeed from representing the disease and mortality which the medical practitioner would trace to the habit of indulgence in spirituous and fermented liquors. Very many of the diseases of the brain, lungs, liver, and kidneys take their origin from this source. The cases of death from Small-Pox were 12. In 1859, the number was 87; in 1860, 23. We are now in a period of decline of this disease. It appears to have its periods of rise and fall. During the intervals of remission, there is a gradual accumulation of subjects susceptible to the disease, who will take it the moment they are exposed to the contagion. Accordingly when a certain amount of fuel for the contagion has been collected, the disease spreads until the fuel is exhausted. I do not regard the low number of the deaths from small-pox during last year as affording particular cause for congratulation. There are no grounds for concluding that any great advance has been made of late years in extending the protection of Vaccination. The returns relating to this subject, 22 that were once relied upon, and cited as the basis of definite conclusions and practical applications by the Poor-Law Board and the Legislature, are, as, I have demonstrated, in previous reports, full of fallacies. These fallacies are now admitted. Considerable amendments in the Compulsory Vaccination Act are required to make it work smoothly and effectually. The following is the official return of the Vaccinations performed during the year 1861. VACCINATION EXTENSION ACT. Annual Return. Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch.

NIGHTINGALE, Clerk to the Guardians Dated this 12th day of June, 1862. This return exhibits a result of 2223 Vaccinations of infants under one year old, against 4864 registered births. This gives a proportion of vaccinations to births of 46 per cent., a proportion materially below that of former years. After making full deduction for the children who die under three months, and for private vaccinations which are not registered, there still, I believe, remains a large surplus of children of whom 23 / no account is taken Their parents neglect both to register their births, and to have them vaccinated. In very numerous cases, the poorer classes in London do not register the birth of a child, unless it happen to fall ill, so that its life is in danger. This circumstance which is of far more frequent occurrence in London, than in rural communities, vitiates all the statistics of Vaccination, and also those relating to illegitimacy. But it is by no means the only source of the erroneous conclusions indulged in by closet statisticians. The Sickness returns, of which a summary is exhibited in Table III. show that a gross total of 6594 new cases of disease came under the care of the four Poor-Law Surgeons during the year. Among these were 21 cases of Small-Pox, 139 of Measles, 81 of Scarlatina, 198 of Whooping-Cough, 69 of Erysipelas, 615 of Diarrhœa, 2 of Cholera, and 813 of fever. The books in which the Poor-Law Surgeons register the name, address, and disease of every new pauper patient, are weekly revised by the Medical Officer of Health. From these books a register is made which shows the locality of every case of epidemic disease, and which serves as an indication for sanitary improvement. By thus tracking disease to its origin, there can be no doubt that much sickness and many deaths are averted. The large proportion of cases of Brain-disease that come under treatment in the Workhouse is worthy of remark. Under this head are included the cases of insanity. The large number of skin diseases indicates the destitution and uncleanliness of many of the persons admitted to the House. 200 Coroners' Inquests were registered. Of these, 35 related to cases of infants suffocated in bed either accidentally, or through negligence, or through criminality. In 117 cases, death was assigned to specified natural diseases. In 46 cases, death was the result of violence inflicted suicidally, accidentally, or homicidally. In two instances no definite cause of death is given. Drinking Fonntains.—The advantage to the public health of substituting drinking-fountains supplied with pure water, for street pumps which are liable to various sources of impurity, is gradually becoming better understood. Many fatal diseases have of late years been traced by the most rigorous researches of physicians and naturalists, to the use 24 of impure waters. Just as large tracts of pasture-land have become comparatively valueless, because they are so contaminated with the excreta of infected animals that sheep cannot feed there without being destroyed by the "rot," so, are the surface-wells of populous places contaminated with excrementitious matter, which is liable when taken into the stomach, to give rise to disease. It is earnestly to be hoped that the handsome fountain erected by Mr. Jeremiah Long, a member of the Vestry, at his own expense, will not long continue to be the only one in the Parish. The Workhouse Well.—The Workhouse is supplied with water by an Artesian Well. In July last, it had become fouled by the penetration of sewage, and by the drippings of oil from the machinery. I transmitted a full report upon the condition of the water to the Board of Guardians, at the request of their Chairman. The Well has been thoroughly repaired. Sanitary Works.—The sanitary works carried out in pursuance of my reports, and otherwise, are summed up in the Report of the Inspector of Nuisances. TABLE I.

I inspected 2730 houses, these include a number of streets where house to house visitations were made, for the purpose of ascertaining the actual state of the drainage, and the existence of cesspools; the result has been that in the course of the year 377 cesspools have been emptied and filled up, 538 proper water closets have been erected in the place of open privies, all provided with proper trapped soil pans, and drains to the sewers; 99 house drains have been cleansed and repaired, thus providing an efficient drainage for 637 houses; the pavement in many of the yards has been repaired, and provision made for the proper drainage of the surface water; 43 houses have been provided with dust bins, and 10 additional windows have been put in to improve ventilation; and 121 houses that had been the seat of contagious disease were either wholly or partially limewashed. While these improvements have not been confined to any particular locality but extended over the entire length and breadth of the parish, yet the largest portion have been in the Wards of Haggerstone and Kingsland. Boston Street where the drainage was very defective, especially on the East side, where foul privies and cesspools were close to the doors and windows of the houses, and where they were seldom without Fever or some other infectious disease, has been entirely changed, and the inhabitants are now enjoying an immunity from sickness altogether unknown before; all the cesspools have been abolished, proper water closets have been erected, and all drained to the sewer. A number of the houses on the West side have also been done and the remainder will soon follow. York-street Hackney-road, Great Cambridge-street, Cumberlandstreet, Brunswick-street, Mansfield-street, York-street Kingsland-road, Fellows-street, and Rutland-street, have all been greatly improved, by the abolition of cesspools, the erection of water closets and proper drains. Since the sewers were constructed in Canal- road and William-street adjoining, the houses there have also been much benefited, many of them which were previously almost unfit for habitation have been drained and rendered healthy and comfortable. 50 During the year I received 9 complaints of Pigs being kept so as to be a nuisance and injurious to health; notices were given to the owners of the premises to have them immediately removed, which was done. Complaints where also made of two Marine store shops, were nuisances were caused by offensive accumulations, one of the places was altogether unfit for such a trade from want of space and proper ventilation; this has been discontinued, and in the other the nuisance has been abated. I made three periodical inspections of the Licensed Slaughter-houses in the course of the year; they are 90 in number and have all been kept in a satisfactory condition; attention to drainage, paving, ventilation, water supply, and cleanliness, being strictly observed. During the year I received 710 applications to have Dust removed which were all promptly attended to by the Contractor. The Roads and Streets have been regularly and efficiently cleansed, and the sweepings and road drift removed in a satisfactory manner. In the course of the year, I summoned four persons before the Magistrate at the Police Court, Worship Street, to show cause for refusing or neglecting to comply with notices I had previously given them, to abolish cesspools and erect proper water closets with drains to the sewers; in all the cases the Magistrate made an order that what was required should be done, and the parties to pay all the costs and expenses incurred in obtaining the order. It may be useful to present at one view the entire number of sanitary improvements effected in the Parish since the establishment of the Vestry in 1856, embracing a period of six years; 2382 cesspools have been abolished, 3549 water closets have been erected in the place of open privies, 2142 house drains have been cleansed and repaired; dust bins have been provided for 543 houses, and 102 additional windows have been put in to improve ventilation; all these Works have been executed at the expense of the owners, and must in the aggregate have involved an outlay of something like £10,000, they are all of a permanent character and cannot fail to have a beneficial effect on the general health of the Parish. 31 THE FOLLOWING BILLS HAVE BEEN BEFORE PARLIAMENT THIS SESSION, AND HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE. North London Railway.—(Branch to the City.) The Vestry petitioned against this Bill, for the purpose of urging upon the Committee of the House of Commons, the introduction of certain clauses with regard 1st.—To compel the Railway Company to make good any deficiencies in the Parish Rates during the construction of the Railway, 2nd.—Presenting the manner in which such Raiiway should cross the streets—the height and span of the arches over the public streets, &c. of the parish—as to the obstruction in any of the carriage-ways, or foot-ways, or projection thereon, or any interference with the present level of the streets. 3rd.—Also as to the Removal of the Refuse of the Parish. The Solicitor to the Vestry, in his report to the Vestry on the 14th July, 1861, says: "Counsel on behalf of the Vestry duly attended before the Com"mittee of the House of Commons, on the 18th and 19th days of "June ultimo, in support of the Petition of your Board against "the said Bill, and some of the Parliamentary Committee of your "Board were also present, and every attempt was made to protect "the interests of the Parish, and to obtain the insertion of the "Clauses so approved by your Parliamentary Committee; and I "am happy to add, that the Clauses in question were ultimately "substantially conceded to, with the exception of the Clause "having reference to the removal of the refuse of the Parish, and "whilst the failure of such success is much to be regretted, still it "must be added, that the Committee of the House deemed the "removol of refuse not unimportant but worthy of consideration, "and there is every probability that had the contemplated 32 "Railway been a Trunk Line instead of a small Branch, that "such Committee would have entertained the Clause in reference "thereto; ane if at any future day an attempt should be made to "convert the Regents Canal into a railway, there is every proba"bility that the rejected Clause might be sustained with success." "I would beg further to add, that through the opposition of ''your Board and the able support of Counsel, the Committee of "the House decided that provisions should be inserted in the Bill, "giving the public a convenient foot access to the Station in "Liverpool Street from Sun Street or Crown Street, as well as "from Liverpool Street or Broad Street Buildings." "I beg in conclusion to add, that the said Bill has duly "passed, and I would refer your Board to Clauses 11, 20, 32, and "77 in the Act in question in confirmation of my foregoing "remarks." Parochial Assessments Bill. This Bill has been again introduced in the House of Commons, with a very material alteration from the one of last Session. The Guardians of the Poor being substituted as the Assessment Board instead of the Justices of the Peace, as in the previous Bill. A Bill as amended by the Select Committee of the House of Commons, has been printed, in which, the Clause repealing the 4th and 5th William 4, cap. 76, (Parochial Assessment Act), has been struck out, and a Clause (27) introduced, which states, that when in any Parish the Vestry, Trustees or Guardians are authorised by any Local Act to make the Poors Rate, such Bill shall not apply to such parish. Metropolis Local Management Act Amendment. This Bill has been again brought before the House of Commons, very nearly similar in its character to the one of last Session, Several Amendments are proposed to be inserted in such Bill, for altering the principle of electing the Members of the Metropolitan Board. For Repealing the Clause, fixing the Qualification of a Vestryman at £25; and providing that persons rated to the Poor in respect of the occupation of any house, &c., shall be eligible. 33 For giving power to Vestries to borrow money for the improvement of streets, &c.
