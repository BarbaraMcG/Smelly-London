THE VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. STATEMENT OF THE W0RK ACCOMPLISHED BY THE VESTRY SINCE THE PASSING OF SIR BENJAMIN HALL'S ACT. PREPARED BY THE OFFICERS OF THE VESTRY, PURSUANT TO A RESOLUTION PASSED BY THE VESTRY ON FEB. 8th 1882. LONDON: penny & hull, printers, leman street, whitechapel, e. 1883. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, On the 8th day of February, 1882, you passed a Resolution, as follows : " That it be an instruction to the Officers of the Vestry to compile a " Statement of the work accomplished by the Vestry since the passing " of Sir Benjamin Hall's Act. Appended hereto is my Statement. I stated at the time that the work would be a heavy one, but it has proved far more arduous than I ever anticipated. At the time of the passing of the Resolution but very little was said to guide the Officers as to what was required. A copy of the Vestry's Minutes would have been an answer to the Resolution, but I could not think that that was what the Vestry required. Upon consideration I came to the conclusion that so far as my department was concerned, the best and proper mode of making the Report was to gather the most important things only under convenient headings, in a manner somewhat similar to that in which I have compiled the Annual Reports of the Vestry during these last few years. By doing so I thought that comparisons could easily be drawn. The most important thing of all, to my mind, was, to shew how the moneys received by the Vestry had been expended. As the Receipts and Expenditure each amounted to upwards of three quarters of a million of money this portion of the work alone was very heavy. Being personally but very slightly acquainted with the proceedings of the Vestry during the first 16 years of its existence, I was compelled to wade through all the proceedings in order to obtain accurate information. iv. The Resolution, in my view of it, rendered it incumbent on me to do the work myself, as it imposed the necessity of judging what was sufficiently important to require to he reported, and therefore, with the exception of the information as to the number of Committee Meetings and a few other details, I am responsible for all the information contained in my Report. The years referred to in the Report in all cases mean the 12 months ending on the 25th March in that year, except in the case of 1857 which includes the period from January, 1856. I sincerely trust that what I have done will fulfil your requirements, and give all the information sought for, but if it fall short I can only say that it is not from any want of will to give it, but from want of knowledge as to the exact information required. I am, Gentlemen, Yours very obediently, MILLNER JUTSUM, Clerk to the Vestry. . Vestry Hall, Bancroft Road, December, 1882. REPORT. The Hamlet of Mile End Old Town covers an area of about 681 acres. Size of Parish. The following statement as to the number of houses, and population may prove both interesting and useful. Year. Number of Houses. Population. Males. Females.

By the Metropolis Management Act, 84 persons were to be elected Vestrymen, and the principle of having several Wards with right to each Ward to elect a certain number of Vestrymen was adopted. No. of Vestrymen. The Wards and number of Vestrymen to be elected by each was as follows:— Ward. No. of Vestrymen to be elected. North. 15 East. 12 Centre. 21 South. 18 West. 18 84 6 In consequence of the increase in the population, and the number and rateable value of houses in the North and East Wards, it was in 1871 felt that the representation of the Hamlet was not quite as it should be, and application was accordingly made to the Metropolitan Board of Works to exercise the power given to them by the Act, and to increase the number of Vestrymen, and to re-arrange the representation. An order was accordingly made by that Board as prayed, and the number of Vestrymen was increased to go, and the number to be elected by each Ward re-arranged and fixed as follows:— Ward. No. of Vestrymen North. 18 East. 18 Centre. 21 South. 18 West. 15 Qualification of Vestryman. The qualification for a Vestryman is a rental of £25, upon which he is rated or assessed to the poor rate. The poor rate assessment at £40 and upwards do not exceed one-sixth of the whole number of such assessments. Meetings. In order to shew whether the Vestrymen of the Hamlet have at all times attended to their duties, I submit a tabulated statement shewing the number of Vestry and Committee meetings in each year, and also shewing the highest, the lowest, and average attendance at such Vestry meetings, and I think it proves incontestably that the Vestrymen have not left the work of the parish to be done by a few only. 7 I cannot ascertain the number of Committee meetings during 1857 and 1858.

Representatives at the Metropolitan Board of Works. The following have been the Vestry's representatives William Ephraim Snow, Esq., from 1855 to 1862. William Newton, Esq. ,, 1862 to 1876. Robert Jones, Esq. ,, 1876, to Oct., 1879, and from June, 1880, to present time. Theodore Moore, Esq., from Oct., 1879, to June, 1880. The first named gentleman served the Vestry most efficiently until ill-health compelled him to resign, when Mr. William Newton was elected in his stead. The Vestry feel justifiable pride in their election of Mr. Newton, for during the time that he held his position at the Metropolitan Board he was one of the foremost supporters of the great improvements which have been effected in the Metropolis of late years and many of them even owe their adoption to his energy and ability. Mr. Jones was elected on the death of Mr. Newton, but finding that his private engagements prevented him from properly attending to the duties he resigned, and Mr. Moore was elected in his place. 8 Mr. Moore in turn found the duties too heavy for him to carry out satisfactorily to himself, and accordingly when his term of office ceased by effluxion of time he did not seek re-election; and Mr. Jones having made other arrangements, which he felt would enable him to devote sufficient time to the duties, the Vestry again elected him. Bye Laws The Vestry, in pursuance of the power in that behalf, early in 1856 framed and passed a set of bye laws for their guidance in the conduct of their business, and they have been found to answer so very well, that although on several occasions they have been carefully considered by Committees, with a view of ascertaining whether any alteration were desirable, it has not been found necessary to make any of great importance. Committees. From the formation of the Vestry there have always been three standing Committees, viz.,— No. 1. For Finance and General Purposes ; 2. ,, Highways, Paving, Lighting and Watering; 3. ,, Drainage, Sewerage and Nuisances; and at the present time there is another, viz., for Dusting and Cleansing. From time to time, as the exigencies of the case required it, special Committees have been appointed for specific objects. No. 1 Committee has now been entrusted with the duties of and is the Parliamentary Committee. Each standing Committee is composed of fifteen members, elected equally from each Ward. No member is allowed to act on more than two of the standing Committees. Expenses of Elections of Vestrymen and Auditors. Until 1877 it was considered (and acted on accordingly) that the Vestry had not anything to do with the payment of the expenses of election of Vestrymen and Auditors, but that all that was required by the Act was that the Vestry should order the amount to be paid out of the poor rate. In the year 1877 it was contended by the Churchwardens and Overseers that the Vestry should pay the amount, and should then order the Churchwardens and Overseers to repay it to the Treasurer of the Vestry. Accordingly (as the subject seemed of little moment) the Vestry in that and the years 1878 and 1879 pursued the course wished by the Churchwardens and Overseers. 9 In the last-mentioned year, however, the Overseers objected to pay certain items included in the order, and the Vestry were obliged to take proceedings, and applied to a magistrate for a distress warrant. The magistrate held that the order of the Vestry was invalid, and expressed an opinion that the original method of ordering the amount to be paid out of the poor rate was the proper one. Since that time the old method has been reverted to. The expenses of the annual elections have been as follows : — £ s. d. £ s. d. 1836 58 15 6 1869 35 10 9 1857 20 4 8 1870 32 11 4 1858 23 11 3 1871 41 19 4 1859 18 9 6 1872 66 6 2 1860 24 14 0 1873 34 4 5 1861 27 0 8 1874 35 13 6 1862 17 18 0 1875 62 4 9 1863 17 16 0 1876 76 1 11 1864 31 3 9 1877 50 3 3 1865 32 7 6 1873 62 6 0 1866 60 15 10 1879 60 11 6 1867 73 8 3 1880 25 19 0 1868 91 9 10 1881 39 4 0 The business cast upon the Vestry by the Act of 1855, rendered it imperative, if it were to be conducted with anything like propriety, that there should be a proper place of Meeting for the Vestry and the Committees, with the requisite rooms for the Officers. Vestry Hall and Offices. The Town House, in which meetings had been formerly held, was found wholly unsuitable for the purpose, and therefore in 1857, the question of providing proper accommodation was brought forward, and referred to a Committee. It was found rather a difficult matter to secure an eligible site on reasonable terms, but in 1860, the Vestry purchased from the Guardians of the Poor of the Hamlet, a piece of ground in Bancroft Road, and thereon the Vestry Hall was built. 10 The total cost for land, building, fittings, &c., was, on 22nd October, 1862, reported to be £5,046 14s. 10d. The rent paid for the partial use of the old Town House was £50 per annum. A difficulty arose between the builder of the Vestry Hall and the Vestry with regard to extras, but it was ultimately settled amicably. Premises for Stone Yard, &c. In addition to the necessity for having a proper Vestry Hall, the Vestry had to secure a suitable place for storage of their plant and material, and found great difficulty in doing so. In 1859, the Vestry took a Wharf at Carr Street, at a rent of £40 per annum, and continued to occupy it until in 1864 they received notice to quit. The Vestry then took the Wharf in Bridge Street of Knight's Executors. In 1868 and again in 1870, the question of purchasing land in Emmott Street was considered but the Vestry declined to do so. In 1877 the Vestry determined to do the work of slopping and dusting by their own plant and men, and it became necessary to have further space. A convenient site was sought for and ultimately it was agreed to purchase Riga Wharf, Emmott Street, held under a lease for 47 years at a rent of £120 for £1000. As soon as the purchase was completed notice to quit the Wharf in Bridge Street was received. This made a considerable alteration of arrangements necessary, as it was very desirable for the Vestry to have a wharf for the purpose of unloading barges bringing the stone, &c., required by the Vestry, and for the stacking of such stone; and the Vestry accordingly determined to use Riga Wharf for that purpose, and to obtain other premises for the stables, &c., required for the purposes of the dusting and slopping. The Vestry accordingly secured stables, &c., in Canal Road, on a lease for 70 years, at £180 per annum. They did not require the house and shop attached thereto, and have let it off on 21 years' lease, at a rental of £50. 11 The following is a list of the principal Officers who have, from officers, time to time, held positions under the Vestry.

The principal of these is the Vestry Clerk, who is appointed under the Vestry Clerk's Act, and who, when appointed, is the Clerk to the Churchwardens and Overseers, and by virtue of his office he is Clerk to the Assessment Committee. As Clerk to the Assessment Committee the Vestry Clerk is subject to that Committee's control, but his salary is paid by the Vestry. Officers. Names. Period of holding office.

Glass 15 Under the Local Act, 50 persons were elected Trustees for Trustees, certain purposes at the open meetings at the Town House. The powers given to the Vestry took away many of the duties of the Trustees, but still some duties were left with them, and therefore the Vestry continued until 1870 to elect the Trustees. In that year the Union Assessment Committee Act was brought into force in the Metropolis, and the Vestry were advised that there was really nothing left for the Trustees to do, and the Vestry therefore determined to cease to appoint them. Assess- mittee. In consequence of the legislation mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Vestry were required to appoint from among their number a certain number to form the Assessment Committee of the Hamlet. The idea was to obtain as far as possible an uniform system of rating throughout the Metropolis. The Overseers have every five years to prepare a Valuation List, which is submitted to and approved by the Assessment Committee, after having heard any objections by the persons alleging that they are improperly rated. After the Assessment Committee have approved of the Valuation List the same becomes binding for five years, unless altered by a court of competent jurisdiction, or unless some altered circumstances occur to the premises rated. The Assessment Committee, it will be seen, therefore form a most important body. Upon the Metropolis Management Act coming into operation such of the Parish Officers who lost emoluments became entitled to compensation, and the following were granted. Compensations on Loss of Office. Mr. O'Shaunessy, £100 per annum for life. Mr. Sadgrove, £17 ,, „ Subsequently on the coming into force of the Act whereby the duty of providing proper means for extinguishing fires in the Metropolis was cast upon the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Vestry granted a pension to Mr. J. Stevens, (late engine keeper) £40 for life. The two first named gentlerren died in 1860, but the latter is still living. 16 Contracts The Vestry deeming that it would be much more satisfactory to the ratepayers and save many disputes, adopted the principle of publicly inviting tenders for all works to be done, or materials to be supplied to the Vestry, and, except under very exceptional circumstances, that principle has been steadily adhered to. It must be open to any unbiassed mind, that in some instances it would be both the worst and most expensive course to adopt, to publically invite tenders, and in such cases the Vestry have not hesitated to do, what under the special circumstances, they considered best in the interest of the rate-payers. To shew that the wholesome principle mentioned has been generally adopted, as well as to show the nature, &c., of many of the things which the Vestry have to look to, the following list of contracts which have been entered into by the Vestry is submitted.

One of the many duties cast upon the Vestry is that of carrying out the orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works for the re-naming and re-numbering of streets. In the Metropolitan Board of Works alone is vested the power of making the orders, but all the work attached in consequence of the order is thrown on the Vestry. The Vestry has to obtain the names of all the occupiers, &c., in every street to which an order applies, and to serve a separate notice upon each, and it will be apparent from a perusal of the following list of streets, in respect of which orders have been made, that a great deal of work has had to be done. As, however, the Metropolitan Board of Works must, before proceeding, receive information of streets in respecft of which it would be advisable for orders to be made, the Vestry has from time to time considered the subject and has sent up to the Board lists of such streets and suggested the alterations required, and in nearly every instance the Vestry's views have been adopted.

In many streets in which there were formerly private residences only, it was found by the owners beneficial to convert places into shops. In such cases, if there were forecourts to the houses, the owners generally try to come out to the full extent of their property. Before doing so the assent of the Metropolitan Board of Works must be obtained. The Board, before granting any license, gives information to the Vestry of the proposed erection, and requests the views of the Vestry on it. In this way the Vestry has had some hundreds of applications before them, and upon their recommendation the Metropolitan Board has, in many instances, varied the plans submitted, and have only granted the license upon conditions that the portion between the front of the new erection and the pavement should be thrown into and form part of the public highway. In other cases the Board has refused their sanction altogether. In the event of a building being ere<fted in advance of the general line without the consent of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Superintending Architect of that Board is empowered to define the general line of frontage in the street, and if the new erection prove in advance of it the Vestry can apply to a magistrate to order it to be pulled down. The magistrate is not bound by the certificate of the Superintending Architect, but may view and determine himself. The Vestry has applied to the Superintending Architect to define such line in the following streets:— In 1867—Bow Common Lane. 1868—Mile End Rd., between Jubilee St. andStepney Green. 1875—Ernest Street. 1877—Stepney Green. 1882—Commercial Road. The Vestrj' took proceedings before a magistrate in the three last cases.' In the case of Ernest Street the builder agreed to conform to certain requirements. In the two last ones the magistrate dismissed the summons. Nuisances to highways By the Metropolis Management Act the Vestry have to exercise the duties of Surveyors of Highways, and therefore it is incumbent on them to prevent any nuisance to the highway arising. 29 In order to shew that the Vestry have been fully alive to the duties thus cast upon them, the following chronological table of events in relation thereto is given:— Nuisances in streets 1856.

April 21 st.—Surveyor authorised to remove all obstructions between the paved footway and the carriage road in the Mile End Road. 1875.—A pipe belonging to the East London Water Company burst in the Commercial Road, and the escape of water caused the part of the road which lay over the main of the Chartered Gas Company to subside for about 50 yards on each side of the fracture. A summons having been taken out against the Company, the magistrate decided that the Company were liable, and they executed the works required. 1876. May 3rd.—Owner to remove gates at entrance of Mile End Place when called on, 32 Nuisances to ways 1876. Dec. 6th.—Attention of police directed to the habit of shopkeepers sweeping refuse into the streets. 1877.—In August of this year Mr. Knight, on behalf of Mr. Nicholson, gave notice to build on Trafalgar Square, and on the site enclosed by him in 1865. The Yestry took proceedings to prevent this a more detailed statement of which will be found under the head of open spaces. 1881 — During this year considerable annoyance and cost was experienced by the proceedings of the Gas and Water Companies. Several of the streets which had only recently been put into thorough repair were opened and not reinstated in a way which met with the approval of the Vestry or their Surveyor. The Gas Light and Coke Company were by far the worst offenders, and they declined to employ a steam roller in reinstating roads where the steam roller had been employed when the road was made up by the Vestry. The Vestry determined to try the question and summoned the Company named before the Police Magistrate. At the hearing the Company produced a great number of witnesses to say that it would be dangerous to the pipes to use the steam roller and the Magistrate dismissed the summons. Subsequently the Company agreed that a horse roller might be used and this was accordingly done. 1882— During this year the Vestry again had considerable difficulty in getting the Gas and Water Companies to properly reinstate the roads after they have made openings. The Commercial Gas Company was the greatest offender. The Vestry hope that ultimately the Companies will see that it is to their own interest to at once thoroughly restore the road as required, rather than have continually to keep making good defects. It may be stated generally that the Vestry has had the greatest difficulty in dealing with the unpaved footway or waste in the Mile End Road. Of late years they have been obliged, at very considerable cost, every Saturday evening, and sometimes on other evenings, to keep a body of men on the spot to prevent the place being made like a fair. On more than one occasion the offenders have shown determined resistance, and the Vestry feel that the only way in which they can deal with the matter, is by having a strong force on the spot. They hope, however, to be able to acquire the rights of the Lord of the Manor over the space, 33 The Vestry are empowered by the Metropolis Management Act, and the Acts incorporated therewith to effect street improvements, and they have accordingly done so. 1857 — Improvements. The important thoroughfare known as Grove Road, was in almost an impassable state at the time that the Vestry was incorporated, and still remained a private road. The Vestry at once set to work to get it dedicated to the public, and succeeded in doing so, and also in getting a contribution from one of the owners toward the expenses of doing the necessary works. The footpaths were at once put into proper order, and certain works done to promote uniformity and remove obstructions. The Vestry also agreed to contribute £1000 towards new road from Limehouse to Bow Road, which was considered to be a necessity, and opened up a large district. 1859 — In this year the Vestry appointed a Deputation to wait on Regents Canal Company, and urge them to widen the Gunmakers' Arms Bridge. The Deputation accordingly attended, and the Regents Canal Company assented to the bridge being rebuilt, but only on condition that it should be done at the sole cost of the Vestry, and according to plans to be approved by Company's Engineer. The Vestry could not agree to their terms, and the matter has accordingly not been done. 1862— The Vestry declined to pay the contribution, which they had agreed to do, towards making Burdett Road on the ground that the works had not been executed as contemplated when they agreed to contribute. 1863- Negotiations were entered into, and terms agreed upon, and on the 7th October, 1863, the Vestry resolved to complete the Burdett Road, on receipt of £1233 from the Metropolitan Board of Works, and of a release of the £1000 agreed to be contributed by the Vestry. The Metropolitan Board of Works agreed to these terms, and the matter was so settled. In 1863, the subject of the improvement in White Horse Lane was considered, and the Metropolitan Board of Works were asked to contribute half the cost of the work, which they agreed to do, if it did not exceed £1200. In this year, too, a letter was received from Dr. Kennedy, asking that Wellington Passage might be opened up for carriage traffic, and the matter was referred to a Committee for consideration and report. C 34 ments, continued. The Committee reported in favour of improvement in Wellington Passage, if the owners of the adjoining land would contribute two-thirds of the cost, which they declined to do. 1865. In this year the Vestry passed the necessary resolutions for carrying out the White Horse Lane improvement, and the matter was at once proceeded with. Some difficulties were experienced in settling the compensations, but finally all were agreed to without going to a jury, and the improvement was effected. 1875— A much needed improvement was carried out by the Vestry during the year, viz : — the widening of the entrance to South Grove. This cost the sum of £100, to which the Metropolitan Board of Works contributed £50. 1877— In the 1877 Session of Parliament, the Great Eastern Railway Company had a bill for the widening of their line, and the Vestry determined, if possible, to obtain an improvement of the Bridges over the principal thoroughfares in the Hamlet. The matter was hardly fought before the Committee of the House of Commons, and ultimately a provision was inserted that upon this Vestry and the Vestry of Bethnal Green, each contributing £500 towards the expenses, the Company are, when executing the work, to pull down the old bridge over Grove Road, and construct the whole of a width of 40 feet with a 15 feet headway. Various other provisions, such as lighting, &c., were also obtained, which have vastly improved the thoroughfare under various bridges. 1877— In this year, too, memorials were received for widening of Charles Street and Oxford Street, and resolutions were passed to make the Oxford Street improvement, provided that the Metropolitan Board of Works would contribute towards the cost, and it was also resolved that if Oxford Street improvement were executed, it would be unnecessary to widen Charles Street. The Metropolitan Board agreed to do as asked, and the Vestry passed the necessary resolutions. The question as to the advisability of improvement at Diamond Row, was also referred to, a Committee for consideration and report. 35 1878— In this year the Vestry resolved to affect the improvement in Diamond Row, by purchasing No. 1, Claremont Place, and widening the road, whereby an additional thoroughfare via Jamaica Street, from Mile End Road to the Commercial Road, was obtained. The Metropolitan Board contributed a moiety of the expenses. 1880— ments, continued. In order to complete the Oxford Street improvement, the Vestry found it requisite to obtain a small piece of land belonging to Bottomley's Trustees, in addition to the lands mentioned in the Vestry's resolution, but this was done by agreement, and the whole improvement has been effected. The Vestry disposed of the surplus land by auction, and it realized very high prices, and the result was that the net cost of the improvement (excepting a small amount of costs which will be hereafter incurred on the re-investment of certain monies paid into the Chancery Division) was £3,209 19s. 3d. The net cost of the Diamond Row improvement was £868 17s. 8d. The total expenditure for both improvements, therefore was £4,078 16s. 11d. The Metropolitan Board of Works contributed £1,687 10s. towards the cost, which left a sum of £2,391 6s. 11d. to be borne by the Vestry. This is a small cost for so unquestionable improvements. To meet the expenses of the above two improvements, the Vestry borrowed £2000 at £3 15s. per cent., the re-payment to be spread over 20 years. 1880— The Great Eastern Railway Company having given notice to the Vestry that they intended proceeding with the widening of their line over Grove Road, the Vestry, pursuant to the Great Eastern Railway Act, 1876, gave notice that they would contribute £500 towards the cost of altering the Grove Road Bridge, as provided by that Act. The Vestry of Bethnal Green passed a similar resolution, and the Company had to re-construct the bridge so as to give a headway of fifteen feet, and to have a span of forty feet. This is a very great advantage to the public, as the old bridge was so low that it was a source of danger to any one passing under it on the top of a tramcar or vehicle of a similar height. The two Vestries applied to the Metropolitan Board to contribute half the cost, as the improvement was for the benefit of the metropolis, or at all events, to the whole of the east end of London, and that Board contributed as desired. Grove rd. railway bridge. 36 ments continued. l88l — The total cost to the Hamlet, including the cost incurred before the Committee of the House of Commons, was under £400. The improvement of the bridge rendered it necessary for the roadway and footpaths to be altered and renewed, and this was accordingly done at a cost of £592, to which the Vestry of Bethnal Green are to contribute one half. Morpeth street railway bridge. In this Session the Vestry opposed two of the proposed provisions of the Great Eastern Railway Bill introduced into Parliament, viz.: [1] That which empowered the Company to continue the line at Loughton through the Forest. [2] That which enabled them to widen the existing line in the Hamlet without providing for the alteration of the Bridge at Morpeth Street. The Company, in the face of the opposition which was exhibited to provision No. 1, withdrew it altogether; and with regard to provision No. 2, they agreed to adopt the principle which had been approved by the Committee of the House of Commons in the case of the Grove Road Bridge, that is to say— "That upon the Vestry contributing toward the extra "cost of the alteration, not exceeding in any event £1000, "the Company should make the alterations in the way "desired by the Vestry." Open spaces. The Vestry have always taken considerable interest on the subject of the preservation of open spaces. 1856— A deputation was, in 1856, formed to join in a movement for the preservation of Hampstead Heath. 1857— In 1857, a Special Committee was appointed to take into consideration all matters connected with parks and open spaces. 1871— In 1871, the Metropolitan Board of Works was requested to take the subject of Stepney Green in hand, the Vestry having ascertained that the Lord of the Manor was willing to come to terms, so as to preserve the space to the public. The Metropolitan Board of Works did as requested, and agreed to enclose Stepney Green on certain terms. Negociations were entered into, and a license of the Lord of Manor to use waste on Stepney Green was received on August 16th. The Metropolitan Board then proceeded to enclose it, and lay out the reclaimed space, and on August 10th, 1873, the Vestry having entered into the necessary covenants as to repair, maintenance, &c., the Metropolitan Board of Works formally handed it over to the Vestry to be kept for the use of the public for all time. 37 1877-8— In August, 1877, the Vestry received from the Metropolitan Board of Works, in the usual way, notice of an application by Mr. Knight, to build upon Trafalgar Square, White Horse Lane. Open spaces continued. The Vestry, having regard to the facts (1) that large sums of public money were being expended to preserve open spaces in the Metropolis, and (2) that what was then within the enclosure, was, a few years since, part of the public highway, resolved to stop any building operations and to restore to the highway the part which they alleged had been wrongfully enclosed. They accordingly served notices on the owners and parties interested, requiring them to pull down the railings, and to restore the place to the state in which it was prior to the railings being erefted, and fixing a time at which the Vestry would themselves proceed with the demolition, in default of the other persons proceeding. The result of this was, that the parties claiming the Square, took proceedings in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice, to restrain the Vestry from carrying out their threat. The Vestry deemed that they were bound to act as they did, and that the parishioners would support them in their view. 1879— The action came on for trial before the Vice-Chancellor, Sir. R. Malins, in November, 1879. Mr. Glass, Q.C., Mr. J. Chester, and Mr. Reid, appeared for the Plaintiffs, and Mr. J. Pearson, Q.C., Mr. F. W. E. Everitt, and Mr. G. Pitt-Lewis for the Vestry. Mr. W. Nicholson was the only witness called on the plaintiff's part, but there were 18 witnesses on the part of the Vestry. The Vice-Chancellor having expressed an opinion that it was clear that the space outside the small circular enclosure, which formerly stood in the square, had been open and dedicated to the public, only Messrs. Pollard, Moody, F. J. Wood and Leatherdale, of the Vestry's witnesses, were called, as the evidence of the others was also to prove that fact. After two days' hearing, the Vice-Chancellor, notwithstanding his opinion as above stated gave judgment for the plaintiffs with costs. The Vestry acting under the advice of counsel, determined to appeal. 1881 — Upon the Appeal coming on before the Lords Justices, they stated that having looked at the papers they thought the case clearly one for compromise, and adjourned it for the purpose. 38 Open spaces, continued. The Vestry did all in their power to effect the wishes of the Lords Justices, and even went far beyond what they were advised to do, but all to no purpose. The Plaintiffs insisted on just such terms as they would get if they wholly succeeded, and accordingly, after months of fruitless negociation, the case had to be set down again for hearing. It was finally heard on the 28th January, 1881, when the Appeal was allowed and the Plaintiffs' Bill Dismissed with costs. This result alone fully justified the Vestry in the course they took, but the Lords Justices evidently considered the Vestry had not insisted on their legal rights only, but were equitably entitled to the judgment. The Plaintiffs gave notice of Appeal to the House of Lords, but failed to conform to the requisite formalties within the time allowed, and the appeal may therefore be considered at an end. The costs have been taxed and allowed as against the Plaintiffs at over £400, but there will be a considerable sum to be paid by the Vestry, as the taxing master only allowed the fees of two counsel, and disallowed all the cost of short hand writer's notes, and also of several of the witnesses. Great difficulty is experienced in obtaining the costs, in consequence of the Plaintiffs being Trustees, and having no money in hand as they allege, but it is hoped that the amount will ultimately be obtained. The Plaintiffs are personally liable for them whether they can get them out of their trust estate or not. Road pavings. The subject of paving the road was among the first which the Vestry took into serious consideration. In 1857 the matter was referred to a Committee, who recommended the borrowing of £40,000, which they estimated was the cost of doing what was necessary. The amount was so large that the Vestry referred the subject back to the Committee for reconsideration, but the Committee could only advise a reduction of £12,000, and the Committee's recommendation was adopted. The subjetfl of borrowing the money was referred to the Finance Committee, who recommended that /5000 should be borrowed at once, and the remainder from time to time as required. The Vestry agreed to this, and divided the money equally between the five wards. The Mile End Road was first proceeded with, and from time to time numerous other works were done, and at March, 1858, it was reported that 68,404 feet of new pavement, and 19.937 of 39 new kerb had been laid, and that 39,510 feet of old paving had been redressed and relaid. 1873— During the year 1873, the Vestry, after most careful consideration, passed resolutions to pave the carriage-ways of the Mile End and Commercial Roads, and to re-pave part of the footways in the Mile End Road. Paving roads. In order that the whole cost which was estimated at £25,000 might be spread over a series of years, the Vestry determined to borrow the amount required, and under the powers given to the Metropolitan Board of Works, that Board agreed to lend the sum at £3 17s. 6d. per cent., the repayment to be spread over a period of 20 years. Messrs. Mowlem & Co. were the contractors for the Commercial Road. The old stone was re-dressed and laid in various streets. The Vestry, during this year, with a view to testing the merits of tar paving and asphalte, had the footpath between Stepney Green and Jubilee Street paved partly with one and partly with the other. Paving works. The paving of Mile End Road was next proceeded with, the contractor being Mr. J. J. Griffiths. 1874— The old stone after being re-dressed, was used for channelling and crossings, and also for paving streets on which the traffic had of late years greatly increased. A great part of the footways in the Mile End Road was also re-paved. The amount £25,000 was received by four instalments) and the interest only ran from the date when the instalment was received, so that a considerable saving was made. 1879— In 1879, the Vestry determined to widen and re-pave the footway on the North side of the Mile End Road, between Eagle Place and western boundary, and the works were completed in 1880. 1880— The Vestry also directed a return to be made of the roadways in the Hamlet which require paving and channelling, and in which crossings ought to be put down. The Highways Committee made several reports on the subject. In the last one submitted, the Committee divided each 40 Paving roads continued. of the works into three classes, namely, Class 1, those requiring to he executed forthwith; Class 2, those which would require execution as soon as class 1 have been finished; and Class 3, those which will ultimately have to he done. The estimated cost of the various works was as follows:— Works. Class 1. Class 2. Class 3. Roadway paving £22086 £10257 £18080 Channels 888 2301 0836 Crossings 522 550 670 Footway paving 859 0 0 Totals £24305 £22108 £25586 1881 — In 1881, the Vestry took in hand some of the paving works included in Class 1 of the Report, viz:—Commercial Road, New Road, Stepney High Street, Stepney Green, and Bridge Street. In order to meet the expense of so doing, the Vestry contracted a further loan of £4000 with the Metropolitan Board of Works, but were unable to secure it at less than 4½ per cent. The foregoing is only a general statement of some of the more important works, the details of which will 110 doubt be found in the Surveyor's Report. Vestry mortgages In previous parts of this Report reference has been made to the borrowing of money by the Vestry. For the sake of convenience the whole of the loans are now stated together. 1858, Feb. 17, £5000 at 5% for 7 yrs.

The Vestry had apportioned to it a part of the debts of the Commercial Road Trust which it has paid off. Commercial-road debt. The amounts of such debts, and the parties to whom the same were paid are as follows:— Amount. To whom paid. £ s. d. 383 11 0 Exectrs. of S. Barclay. 287 13 3 „ M. E. Stewart. 268 9 9 J. C.

In 1868 the Tramways' Company obtained an Act authorising the construction of a line down the Mile End Road. Tramways Under the powers contained 111 the Act the Vestry appointed their surveyor to superintend the works, and gave notice to the Company thereof, and of the nature, &c., of the materials to be used. The Company had on several occasions during the construction of the line to take up and re-execute portions of the works which were improperly done; but notwithstanding this the line has ever since been a source of constant annoyance, in consequence of it being continually out of repair. The Vestry have served many notices 011 the Company lo repair, which have been attended to; and of late years, as the subject has become better understood, new methods and materials are used which certainly are a considerable improvement upon the old, but still not what could be wished for. When the Mile End Road was under repair in 1874 the whole road was relaid for its entire width, which provided greater uniformity. In 1873 the lines on the Commercial Road and Limehouse and Victoria Park routes were opened, and the same remarks apply to these as to the Mile End Road. Although no doubt the tramcars are of great utility to an immense number of people, the nuisance caused by the rails is very great to persons using vehicles) and the utmost vigilance of the local authority is required to keep thern in anything like order as prescribed by Act of Parliament. 42 Paving streets at expense of owners. One of the important powers conferred on the Vestry is that of having certain classes of streets made up at the expense of the owners. Under the original Act some difficulties were experienced, but still the Vestry succeeded in getting some works done. They were as follows:— Year. Names of Streets. Year. Names of Streets. 1857 Crombie's-row 1858 Albert-road 1858 Devonshire-street East Norfolk-street, (N. W.) East-street York-place, (C. W.) Albert-street The difficulties mentioned above were removed by the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862, and the Vestry were then able to proceed more effectually, and since then they have made the necessary orders in the following cases. Year. Names of Streets. Year. Names of Streets. 1862 Cologne-street Longnor-road 1863 Regent-street, S.

The Whitechapel Guardians (the owners) objected to pay. Paving streets at expense of owners continued. The matter was taken to the Court of Queen s Bench, and ultimately to the Court of Appeal, and it was held that the apportionment was bad, and that it must be made on the property forming both sides of the street. The Vestry have been successful in nearly all cases in getting in the whole of the apportioned amounts. 1866. On the 18th July in the year 1866 the Diseases Prevention Act, 1855, was declared by the Privy Council to be in force in the Hamlet in consequence of the outbreak of cholera. Infectious diseases. A Special Committee was at once appointed by the Vestry to carry out provisions of the Act. They forthwith met and the Surveyor was directed to disinfect all cesspools as far as possible, so that the same might not be emptied during the epidemic. With a view of further meeting all requirements the Special Committee was empowered to act for the Vestry under the Nuisances Removal Act and Sanitary Acts. The Committee it is hoped did all that was required, but the report of the Medical Officer is referred to for particulars. The cost to the Vestry of carrying out orders of Privy Council reported to be £1130 5s. 9d. 1869. In 1869 an epidemic of fever and scarlatina broke out, and a Special Committee was appointed to act for Vestry. 1870.—In consequence of the continuation of the infectious disease, and all the hospitals being full, the Committee, with the assent of the Vestry, provided a temporary hospital for the receipt of patients, as authorised by the Sanitary Act, 1861. In November a summons was directed to be taken out against a person for improperly letting a room without it having been properly disinfected, but it was subsequently ordered to stand over in consequence of explanations having been given, which were satisfactory to the Vestry. 1871. In 1871 an epidemic of small pox broke out of a very bad kind. The medical officer was authorised to secure services of a visitor, which he accordingly did. The Guardians being willing to allow 44 infectious diseases continued. clothes, &c., to be disinfected at their disinfecting oven, if the Vestry provided a truck and made alterations at the oven. The Vestry agreed to do this, and no doubt the doing of the disinfecting in a proper way was of great service. 1877. In 1877 another small pox epidemic broke out, and a Special Committee was appointed with power to act on behalf of the Vestry. The Committee came to an arrangement with the Guardians to have 40 beds at Vestry's disposal, the Vestry undertaking to pay cost of patients and the Guardians undertaking the care of them. The Vestry assented to this arrangement, and it was found to act well. 1880. During the year 1880 the question of hospital accommodation for persons of the non-pauper class received great attention from the Vestry. Under the Act 42 & 43 Vic. cap. 54, the Vestry is empowered to provide this or to combine with other parishes in doing so; and, under the Act mentioned, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, with approbation of the Local Government Board, are empowered to agree with the Vestries and District Boards of London to receive such patients, and the Vestry can recover the expenses. Having gone carefully into the matter the Vestry came to the conclusion that it would be more beneficial to the Hamlet to combine with the neighbouring parishes in having a separate hospital of their own rather than to adopt the provisions of the above-mentioned Act, for past experience of the mode of conducting business by the Metropolitan Asylums Board did not at all betoken economical arrangements. The Metropolitan Asylums Board were accordingly informed that the Vestry did not intend to adopt the provisions of the Act mentioned. To meet any cases of infectious diseases which might arise from time to time, until some definite plan was fixed 011, the Vestry empowered their medical officer to send any cases to the Highgate Small Pox Hospital or the Islington Fever Hospital, as the case might be. The Board of Works for the Poplar District having built a hospital for the class of persons named, at Plaistow, the Vestry negociated with them with reference to a joint ownership thereof, or some other arrangement whereby the hospital might become available for the non-pauper persons of this Hamlet suffering from infectious diseases. 1881. Whilst negociations were in progress (viz., in 1881) another small pox epidemic occurred, which necessitated the making 45 provision of a temporary nature for the accommodation of persons as the Asylum Board Hospitals were full. The subject of the negociation with the Poplar Board has been already mentioned. Infectious diseases, continued. The Sanitary Committee of the Vestry visited the Hospital on several occasions and went very fully into the matter, especially as to the cost, and reported that the cost to this Hamlet, which a joint ownership and occupation would entail, having regard to the facts and figures presented by the Poplar Board, would be at least £800 a year. The Vestry resolved that it would not be advisable to join with the Poplar Board as proposed. The fresh outbreak of small-pox pointed to the desirability of having some place immediately available for such a contingency but the Yestry felt and feel that it would be more economical to provide accommodation as necessity requires rather than embark in such a certain annual outlay. In consequence of the small-pox outbreak, it became necessary to provide an extra ambulance, and the Vestry accordingly purchased a second-hand carriage and converted it to the purpose required. The Vestry has paid great attention to the doing away with nuisances, as a reference to the Reports of the Medical Officer and Inspector of Nuisances will shew. Nuisances. The Vestry have caused new or enlarged public conveniences to be eredted at the end of Philpot Street, Commercial Road; Cambridge Road, Mile End Road; Burdett Road, Mile End Road; Burdett Road, (near Railway), Stepney Green ; Mile End Road ; Beaumont Street, Mile End Road. Public conveniences. They have also caused many others to be improved, and have adopted a regular system of flushing, &c., to prevent the places becoming a nuisance. Until quite recently the Yestry had cast upon them the duty of overlooking the slaughter and cow-houses in their district. Within these last few years, however, the Metropolitan Board of Works has been authorised by Parliament to have equal jurisdiction with the Vestries, and that Board has a special staff appointed for the purpose. Slaughter and cow house licenses. J. he Vestry, however, do not fail to continue their supervision, but on the contrary instruct their officers to assist the officers of the Metropolitan Board of Works whenever proper. 46 The following is a list of the numbers of applications made. Year. Slaughter houses. Cow houses. Year. Slaughter houses. Cow houses. 1856 34 1869 43 37 1857 29 1870 43 42 1858 27 1871 42 37 1859 28 1872 39 38 1860 32 1873 37 42 1861 31 1874 36 42 1862 34 30 1875 29 45 1863 34 37 1870 29 45 1864 36 38 1877 24 44 1865 33 34 1878 23 40 1866 33 30 1879 23 40 1867 37 33 1880 23 47 1868 40 38 1881 21 48 Aitizans' and laborers' dwellings act. One of the most valuable pieces of legislation ever passed in principle, undoubtedly was the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Adt, 1868; but the method to be pursued in parrying it out, renders it far less useful than it would otherwise have been. The mode of operation is as follows:— The Medical Officer has first to report. That report has to be referred to the Surveyor to report on, and copies of both reports have to be sent to the owners, with notice of the time and place fixed by the Vestry for their consideration. The owner has a right of being heard on objections. If the Vestry decide that anything has to be done, the owner has power of appeal, and the result is that much time has to be wasted. The Vestry have, as will be seen by the following list, endeavoured to do their best, and have been most successful in getting necessary works done by the owners, as in all of them, except one, the wishes of the Vestry have been carried out, and, in the excepted case, the property was shut up. In 1868. Nos. 13 to 17, Frimley Street, were reported under the adt. In 1869. ,, 1 to 10, Eaton Place. Two houses at rear of 13, Mile End Road. I11 1874. Upper York Place. In 1876.

In the first-mentioned cases it was arranged that the property should be pulled down, whilst in the others the tenants were removed, and the houses shut up, or works executed to prevent the places from being dangerous to the health of the inhabitants, although not altogether what could be wished. The houses, as may be judged, are inhabited by a class ot persons who can pay but little rent, and if they were turned out, would, in many instances, be homeless. The Vestry feel, however, that they have a duty to perform, and must not allow places to exist, which may become a centre for infectious diseases, and they hope that they will succeed by the manner in which they act. In 1871, in consequence of communications from the Churchwardens and Overseers, a Special Committee was appointed to consider this subject. It appeared that the Watch House not being longer required to be used by the police, the Commissioners were willing to reconvev it. Old watch house, Stepney green. The Churchwardens and Overseers claimed to be the persons to whom the same should be re-conveyed. The Clerk to the Vestry advised that the Vestry were themselves the persons to have it. A joint case was accordingly submitted to Mr. C. Hall, (afterward V.C.) who decided in favour the Vestry's claim. In 1874, the Watch House was accordingly re-conveyed to certain trustees nominated on behalf of the Vestry. In 1875, the Vestry having no use for the house, determined to dispose of it, and it was accordingly sold, and produced the considerable sum of £510, which was carried to the Vestry's general account. 1875. The Act for the prevention of the Adulteration of Food, &c., passed in 1872, was put in force in the Hamlet, in the year 1875. Adulteration Acts Dr. Corner was appointed Anaylist, Mr. Leshaw Inspector. The salary of the Analyst was fixed at £52 10s., and a fee of 7/6 for each analysis. A detailed statement of what has been done will be found in the returns of the officers, but the Vestry cannot fail to remark that the general public do not take the slightest interest in the question for not a single person has ever privately taken a sample to the analyst in the manner provided by the Act, 48 mentary The Vestry consider that it is within their province to consider all Bills brought before Parliament, which may affect the interests of the ratepayers of this Hamlet. This really involves the consideration of many bills which, by their titles, may affect, but which upon consideration are found not at all or only in a very indirect manner to affect the Hamlet. The following is a list of the bills which have from time to time been considered, and where the Vestry have deemed it necessary to take further action the nature of such action is set forth in the last column opposite the bill.

In 1881, the Vestry became engaged in an expensive litigation which proved adverse to the Vestry, but which involved such serious questions that the Vestry felt it incumbent upon them to take it to the Court of Appeal. The facts of the case are very simple. The Plaintiff was going home from work two days after the momorable snow storm of the 18th January, 1881, and when passing along Charles Street, it is alleged he slipped on the iron plate forming the cover to the Blackmore v. Vestry. 52 Claims for compensation continued. water meter box, which by wear had become smooth. The Plaintiff alleged that allowing it to become smooth is negligence, which rendered the Vestry liable. The Vestry contended that it is not negligence, and that even if it were, the Vestry put it in its place and owned it in their capacity as Surveyors of Highways, and that therefore they were not liable upon the well-established law, that Surveyors of Highways are not liable for non-feasance, but only for mis-feasance. The jury found that the state of facts showed negligence, and gave a verdict for £154 damages, and the judge allowed costs. The Vestry hoped upon the law of the case, to get the verdict set aside; applied for and obtained a rule nisi before the Divisional Court to set aside the verdict and to enter judgment for the defendants on the point of law. Upon the argument of the rule the judges decided against the Vestry. The consequences of the result of the case seemed so very serious to the Vestry as opening the door to all sorts of fictitious claims that the Vestry determined to go to the Court of Appeal, but that Court came to the same conclusion as the Courts below. Having regard to the immense expense of an Appeal to the House of Lords, the Vestry did not feel justified, under the circumstances, in incurring it, but they still feel that the judgment is open to question. Sewers. The subject of the Sewers in the Hamlet was one of the very first things which engaged the attention of the Vestry, as will be seen by a reference to the following chronological statement. The expense of at once doing the whole work was found to be so enormous, that the Vestry could not well entertain it, and they have therefore adopted the principle of, from time to time, executing works as the exigencies of the time required. The Vestry also determined to stop all tampering with the sewers, and kept a sharp look out on persons offending. The following statement may be found useful for reference, but the subject-matter of this heading is essentially one for the other Officers, and I have therefore not gone deeply into the question. The subjects, which cannot well be put in a tabulated form, I purpose putting in order of date. 53 1856. April 16.—Committee reported that there were 15 miles of streets in Hamlet unsewered, the cost of doing which would be £25,374, and recommended the borrowing of the money to do the work, but the Vestry referred the matter back. Sewers, continued. Vestry resolved that sewers should be laid in Rhodeswell Estate on terms of a special arrangement by which owners of property contributed nearly whole of the cost. April 30th.— Sewer Committee recommended that a sewer rate of 8d. in the £ be levied to carry out sewer work. Ordered to stand over till next Meeting. May 7th.—Last Report adopted. 1857-8. Sewers constructed in York Place and Alfred Street. 81 new gullies formed. 1858. May 12th.— Resolution calling on Great Central Gas Company to stop nuisance caused by their discharging sulphuretted hydrogen into sewer. Sept. 15th. —Summons ordered against Ennor for making connections with sewer without license. Nov. 10.— Report that Magistrate had expressed opinion that Ennor had incurred penalty, but adjourned summons to enable work to be properly done. 1859. Sept. 4.—Special Report presented as to sewer works required. Report presented that sewer contractor had executed his work improperly, and order made that it be taken up and properly done. Oct. 5.—Williamson's contract for sewer works annulled without prejudice to Vestry's claim. ,, 19.—Surveyor ordered to complete Williamson's work. Nov. 2.—Sewer's works in various streets ordered. Estimated cost £700. 1860. Mar. 28th.—Williamson claimed £412 5s. 10d. as due to him. 1862. Oct. 8th.—Notice given to Mr. Curry to open sewer works being executed by him in Bow Common Lane where required in order to see that same had been properly executed. 54 Sewers, continued. 1863. Dec. 2nd.—Resolution to reconstruct sewer in Hannibal Road. 1864. Nov. 2nd. —Resolution to carry out works in Canal Road, Bow Common Lane, Storer Street, Gray Street and York Street. 1865. Nov. 29th. — Report that two persons convicted and fined for interfering with sewers. Oct. 30th.—Furman convicted for breaking into sewer and diverting it. 1868. Mar. 11th.—Surveyor reported that cost of completion of sewerage work would amount to £4,370. Aug. 12th.—The Sewers in Rhodeswell Road and Silver Street agreed to. Nov. 10.—Old sewer on north side of Mile End Road from Bancroft Road to Globe Road ordered to be destroyed and the drains to be connected with the new sewer. Dec. 14.— Arrangement made whereby the Tower Hamlets Cemetery Company agreed to pay Vestry £300 for right to drain into sewer in Bow Common Lane. 1873. In the year ending March, 1873, the most important sewer work was the construction of a sewer in Bow Common Lane. This sewer was another important step in the direction of providing a complete system of drainage. 1874. In the year 1874, consequence of the heavy expenditure for paving, there was no sewerage work of any considerable magnitude. The most important were the diverting of the sewer in Gloucester Street, and reconstructing the sewers in Wentworth Road, Edward's Road and William Street. 1876. In consequence of the works of the East London Railway Company it was necessary to divert the sewers in Bedford Street. By an arrangement with the Company the work was done by the Contractor to the Vestry, but the Company paid the cost. 55 1877. Sewer in Lincoln Street ordered. Sewers, continued l88l. The sewer on the boundary between this Hamlet and Bethnal Green required reconstruction. The Vestry required that Bethnal Green should contribute half the cost, which, for a long time, they objected to do, but at last, assented. The most important matter in the Clerk's department is the financial, and to that I paid the closest attention. As statements have been made in many places disparaging to the way in which the accounts of local boards have been kept, I deemed it most essential to give clear statements of the sources from which the funds expended by the Vestry have been received, and also of the subjects in which they have been expended. It will be observed that there is no item for "sundries." I went most carefully through the cash and petty cash books, and placed every item to some proper heading. These are all arranged alphabetically in the accounts, which I submit herewith, which I hope will be found useful. I also submit a Statement shewing the amount in the £ called for in each quarter for poor rate, and the amount of each precept or order made by the Vestry for the rates under its own control. Financial. Also the amount paid out of the rates to the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London on their precepts. Year. Date when made. Poor Rate, in £. General. Lightg.

In 1881 the Vestry and the Parochial Officers having for some time felt that if they could not reduce the amount of the rates, they might, perhaps, give the ratepayers some relief by making the rates of a more equal nature, the Vestry determined, as an experiment, to make a half-yearly Call for the amounts they require, instead of a quarterly one. The Vestry had every belief that this would greatly assist the Parochial Officers in equalizing the rates, as they would thereby get cognizance of all that would be required during the six months, and could make arrangements accordingly. The system was tried for twelve months, and having been found to work well, the Vestry have resolved to adopt it in future. 58 Year. Amounts paid to M. B. of W. School Board. Year.

The Metropolis Water Act, 1871, provided for the Companies giving a constant supply upon certain regulations. The regulations were to be sanctioned by the Board of Trade who could hear Metropolitan Board of Works. The Vestry, through its representative, made several suggestions to the Metropolitan Board of Works which were received with favor. The Metropolitan Board objected to many of the regulations, but the Board of Trade sanctioned many which if complied with would cost so much as to render it out of the question for owners of small property to adopt. Nov. —In the November of this year occurred the memorable event known as the "Gas Strike," when, in consequence of differences between the employer and employed, the latter suddenly struck work, and the whole metropolis was in danger of being without light. As representatives of the Hamlet, the Vestry, to prevent 65 1873. the loss both of life and property which must inevitably have resulted from such an event, without entering into the merits of the question at issue, placed at the disposal of the Company supplying the Hamlet with gas, the services of such of the men in the Vestry's employ as could be spared. The offer was gratefully acknowledged, but the Company were enabled to do without the proffered aid. General, continued. Gas strike 1874. Order of Metropolitan Board of Works received placing part of. the Commercial Road in the parish of Limehouse under their control, and placing part of the same road in this Hamlet under the control of the Limehouse Board. The boundary line ran in a diagonal way across the road which rendered the doing of repairs difficult. The division now runs at right angles across the road. Order re Commercial Road maintenance. 1875. On the nth of July, 1874, a very violent thunderstorm burst over the metropolis, inflicting very considerable damage, as the sewers were insufficient to carry off the immense volume of water which fell. Thunderstorms. Vestry empowered the Assessment Committee to appear as respondents in an appeal to the General Assessment Sessions by the School Board for London against the rating of the Board Schools in Essex Street, Johnson Street, St. Paul's Road, and Gloucester Street. The aggregate of the rateable values in the list was £1960 0 0 The School Board desired it reduced to 659 16 8 which would be a reduction of . £1300 3 4 School Board Schools Assess ment. The Sessions upheld the Rating and dismissed the appeal with costs. The principle thus laid down fixed the mode of assessing schools for the whole metropolis. 1876. Order made by Metropolitan Board of Works for placing portion of Medway Road in the parish of Bethnal Green under the control of this Vestry and parts in this Hamlet under the Vestry of Bethnal Green, so that each parish might be able to repair the whole width of the road. Order re maintenance of Medway Road. Auditors declined to pass a sum of £125 paid to Assessment Committee without vouchers for items being produced, and would not take the receipt of the clerk. Disallowance by Auditors. E 66 General, continued. 1877. The item not passed last year satifactorily accounted for to Auditors. Cabman's shelter, Burdett Road. May 31st.—Leave given to erect a Cabman's Shelter in Burdett Road. Clerk reported as to South Grove action. Sept. 20th.—Portrait of Mr. Newton presented. 1878. Storms. Heavy storms again prevailed and very serious damage caused by the floodings of basements in consequence of the water not being able to get away. Whitechapel Hay Market. The Vestry took the initiative to get the Whitechapel Hay and Straw Market removed and secure better regulations. 1879. On April 11 and June 23, violent storms. During the year two suggestions were received by the Vestry which, in the opinion of the Vestry, would greatly conduce to the convenience of the public if carried out. Street Refuges Cab Radius. One was from the Home Secretary as to placing a Street Refuge in Mile End Road, near Sidney Street; the other was from the Commissioners of Police as to placing lamps at the four-mile radius, with a notice to that effect upon them. The Vestry accordingly acceded to both suggestions and they are in the course of being carried out. Price of Gas to Public Lamps reduced. Rating of of Vestry Hall. The price of gas for the public lamps was reduced from £4 6s. 3d. to £4 3s. od. per lamp per annum. The Vestry Hall was put into rating this year by the Overseers. The Vestry appealed to the Assessment Committee. The Committee affirmed the principle, but reduced the rateable value to £125. Compounding Rates. The Vestry resolved, that the allowance to Owners who contract under Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act should be 20 per cent. on hereditaments the rateable value of which should not be above £15. Storms In July, 1880, violent storms. 1881. Refreshments to Committees on Survey. For some longtime objections having frequently been taken to the amount expended by Committees when out on survey, in order to prevent the recurrence of these the Vestry resolved, that a sum not exceeding five shillings per head should be allowed in such cases. 67 i88i. The Vestry think that no Ratepayer will object to such a sum being allowed to gentlemen who give several hours work in the best part of the day for the benefit of the parish. General, continued. 1882. Price of gas to public lamps reduced to £3 19s. 6d. From time to time numerous complaints were made to the Vestry of the insecure nature of the fences between the ends of some of the streets bordering on the Regent's Canal, and the canal itself, and the consequent frequent immersions of children and deaths from drowning. Reduction and price of Gas. Walls at end of streets leading to Regent's Canal. The Vestry, after careful consideration of the facts, thought it was within their province to act, and accordingly resolved to build walls across the ends of two of the streets, and the Vestry have every reason to believe that the Canal Company will contribute towards the cost of so doing. The Metropolitan Board of Works having determined to construct a storm-overflow sewer so as to prevent floodings, the Vestry memoralized that Board, whilst carrying out those works, to lower the level of the existing sewer, so as to enable the Vestry to alter the sewers under its control so as to prevent the recurrence of floodings, but the Metropolitan Board of Works came to the conclusion, that it would be better to wait and see what the effects of their works would be before doing so. Overflow Sewer. The very important question of further means of communication between the north and south of the Thames, below London Bridge, has again been gone into by the Vestry, and they have arrived at the conclusion that some such communication is absolutely necessary. Communication over Thames East of London Bridge. The Vestry fully appreciate the fact, that the carrying out of the scheme may affect some particular class or classes, but at the same time they consider that what is most beneficial for the general public must prevail over merely personal interests. The Vestry do not urge any particular form of communication, but they have communicated to the Metropolitan Board of Works their opinions, and have urged that body to take steps to procure Parliamentary powers to carry out the work in such way as may be deemed most advantageous to all. MILLNER JUTSUM, Clerk to the Vestry. Surveyor's Department. REPORT. Gentlemen, In accordance with your instructions I beg to lay before you a History of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town for the past 26 years, that is, from the date at which the Vestry came into existence to the present time. At that time I was but 12 years of age, and my principal recollection of the streets of the Hamlet is, that they were in a fearfully neglected condition, and that in going to school in Canal Road, in winter time, it was necessary to keep very close to the wall as the footpath and road were virtually one, and that it was no uncommon thing to get one's boots filled when crossing the road. Bancroft Place was another road, although of large traffic, where there was practically no division between the road and footpath, and I well remember seeing written on the wall or Mr. Ludbrook's house, "Indict the parish for this scandalous road." The two main roads were managed by Turnpike Trustees, who maintained no less than eight tool houses and side bars in the district, and the expense and annoyance to any equestrian who only wanted to cross the road for a length exceeding 100 yards was very great. The Trustees used the side of the road to dry the slop, upon little dams being formed with some of the dry material, and the centre filled with slop ; the roads were badly lighted, and persons frequently slipped or fell into them. Bow Common was a perfect sea of mud, and an easterly wind always brought unsavoury odours which were known in my home as Bow Common smells. Even the main roads had but little paving on the footpaths, and the by-streets were fearfully neglected in this respect. Bow Common, Globe Fields, Ben Jonson Fields, the Clare Hall Estate, Stepney Green, Canal Road, South Grove Estate, the whole of the district lying north of the Great Eastern Railway in the East Ward were not built upon; the courts and alleys all over the district were unpaved, and undrained, except into cesspools; long cavalcades of night vans came out of Essex every night, and the business of a Nightman was considered a lucrative 72 occupation; even the better class of shops were drained into cesspools, and water-closets were things unknown in the parish. The records of the first year's work of the Vestry appear to have been indifferently kept, but I find by the Minute Book, that 10 lamp posts were fixed. 3500 yards of flint were used in repairs. 2500 tons of granite. 2000 feet of kerb were laid. 2 water carts were purchased. The Surveyor was directed to report upon the drainage of the Hamlet. 5 stand posts were erected. Paving works were executed in Mile End Road, Oxford Street, Green Street, and Jubilee Street. The drainage of Charles Street, Ann Street, James Street, Essex Street, North Place, North Street, John Street, York Place, and other places. Skidmore Street and Cannon Place were made up. 50 new gullies were put down. No less a sum than £22,000 worth of sewers' work was found to be necessary. In 1857 the paving of the footpaths in the Mile End Road was commenced, and throughout the more frequented portion, new paving of greater width than had previously existed was laid, in this work the Vestry expended £1,600. Although the Mile End Road, from its being the great thoroughfare of the Hamlet, was deemed entitled to priority in the intended paving operations of the Vestry, the other parts of their district were not neglected, and £5000 were borrowed on mortgage of the rates for this purpose. 68,404 feet of new paving; 19,937 feet of new kerb; 39,510 feet of old paving were laid or re-laid. One of the most important improvements executed during this year was the making of Grove Road into a public thoroughfare. This road, though an important thoroughfare, continued for many years in a very bad and almost impassable state. This arose from the fact that it had never been adopted by the Parochial Authorities, and retained the character of a private road. The Vestry obtained the dedication of this road by the various owners, and a contribution of £100 was received from them towards the cost of making up the road and kerbing the footpaths. 73 In this year, the "Victoria Park Approach," now called the Burdett Road, was first projected, and the Vestry agreed to contribute £1000 towards the cost of the work. In addition to Grove Road, Devonshire Street, East, East Street, now Bancroft Road, (north end), Albert Street, Albert Road, and part of Norfolk Street, in the North Ward, and York Place, now Harford Street, in the Centre Ward, were made up and taken to under special arrangements with the owners of property therein. In this year the desirability of re-numbering the houses in the different streets was considered by the Vestry, who recommended the Metropolitan Board of Works to effect this desirable improvement in the Mile End and Commercial Roads. During this year the Vestry were engaged in an expensive and unsuccessful litigation, in consequence of the steps they took to remove the penthouse and other things placed on the unpaved footway fronting the Earl Grey in the Mile End Road. This case, known as Le Neve v. The Vestry of Mile End Old Town, has unfortunately been made a precedent, and no attempt ever made to reverse it, although I often heard the late Mr. Thomas Price recommend the Vestry to try another case, as in his opinion the Vestry proceeded in an improper manner, otherwise the case would never have been lost. The Vestrymen removed the alleged obstruction before daylight in the morning, and this appeared to be a grave offence in the eyes of the Court. 914 feet of 3ft. gin. by 2ft. 6in. brick sewer. 1200 ,, 3ft. 6in. ,, 2ft. 3in. ,, 1030 ,, 3ft. oin. ,, 2ft. oin. ,, 2519 „ 15m. pipe. 762 „ I2in. „ Were laid during this year in St. Dunstan's Road, St. Ann's Road, Park Road, St. Thomas' Road, York Place and Alfred Street. In most of these cases an amount equal to 75 per cent. of the total cost was received from the owners of property in the various streets. The cost of removing dust was £389, and of slopping for a year £415. It was in the year 1858 to 9 that the real work of the Vestry began, the great feature of that year being the large amount of new paving laid, no less than 255,963 superficial feet at a cost of £7016 13s. od. were distributed over the various wards, 74 12000 feet of curb, at a cost of £600, were laid. 2111 yards of new pitching were purchased at a cost of £475. In this year the first resolution to water the roads was passed, and then new water carts were purchased. 7,736 level feet of new roads were added to those previously in existence. Nine additional lamps were erected during this year, and the price paid for lighting was £4 8s. per lamp. 937 feet of 3ft. oin. by 2ft. oin. brick sewer, 3052 „ 15111. pipes. 636 „ 12in. „ 340 „ 9in. „ 43 new gullies were constructed this year. On the 20th May a heavy fall of rain fell just before high water, the Vestry's sewers were overcharged, and all the low basements were flooded. In the year 1860 the following paving work was done:— 245,000 feet of new paving at a cost of £6,682 5s. 10d. 400 yards of carriage-way at a cost of £160. 9,936 feet of Cornish curb at a cost of £579 12s. 0d. 10,832 level feet of new roads were added to those of the Hamlet. The principal part of the costs of these roads was borne by the owners of property. The most important work done during this year was in the sewers department, when the following were laid:— Size of Sewer. Length. 3ft. gin. by 2ft. 6in. 2,500 feet. 3ft. 0in. ,, 2ft. 0in. 3,986 „ 2ft. 0in. ,, 2ft. 0in. 130 „ 1ft. 3m. ,, 1ft. 3m. 2,742 „ 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 11,659 ,, 148 new gullies were constructed. 419 houses which had previously been drained into cesspools, were panned, trapped, and connected with the new sewers in addition to the newly built houses. During 1861 continued attention was given to the question of paving 112,327 feet of new paving having been laid at a cost of £3,028 16s. 5½d., in addition to 10,000 feet of paving for repairs which cost £209 is. 8d. But little or no carriageway paving was done this year, but 1,900 level feet of new roads were added to those already under the charge of the Vestry. 75 The following sewers were constructed during the year:— Size of Sewer. Length. 3ft. gin. by 2ft. 6in. 980 feet. 3ft. 6in. ,, 2ft. 3in. 586 ,, 3ft. oin. ,, 2ft. 0in. 823 ,, 2ft. oin. ,, 2ft. 0in. 119 „ 1ft. 3in. ,, 1ft. 3m. 82 ,, 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 1,110 ,, 31 new gullies were made and connected with the sewers. The cost of these works to the Vestry was £737 15s. 9d. 206 old houses and 92 new ones were connected with the sewers during the year. In 1862 the quantity of new paving laid down was 21,636 feet, and the cost £427 3s. od., in addition to 20,895 feet used for repairs. 5,009 feet of curb was laid in the Hamlet. A length of 1,810 feet of new roads was added to the streets of the Hamlet. It was during this year that the Vestry Hall was completed and opened, and I can say from my personal experience that it was not one moment before it was wanted. The old offices and the board room were low, badly lighted, overrun with rats and other vermin, they had a disgusting smell, and how all the occupants escaped typhoid fever is a mystery. The following sewers were made during the year:— Size of Sewer. Length. 3ft. 9in. by 2ft. 6in. 2,170 feet. 3ft. 0in. ,, 2ft. 0in. 928 ,, 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 3,142 „ 0ft. 9in. ,, 0ft. 9in. 1,125 ,, 189 old houses were drained into the sewers in addition to 111 new ones. 36 new gullies were constructed. The cost of this work to the Vestry was £749 1s. 3d. A new slate urinal was erected in the Mile End Road, at the corner of Cleveland Street. In 1863, that portion of the Commercial Road from the eastern boundary of the Hamlet, on the north side, to Philpot Street, was paved ten feet in width, with new three inch paving, and the space from the back of this ten feet course to the fronts of the houses was repaved with the best of the paving which was taken up. 16,540 feet of inch tooled York paving was laid by the Vestry's men, the cost being £710 11s. 6d. The portion of the New Road which is in this Hamlet, and the south end of Jubilee Street, were paved with old stone, purchased by contract, the total cost being £1.126 12s. gd. 76 The roads laid out and taken to during this year, were Grafton Street, Holford Street, Carlton Road South, Norfolk Street, and York Street, the aggregate length being 3,330 feet. The sewers constructed were— Size of Sewer. Length. 3ft. 6in. by 2ft. 6in. 366 feet. 3ft. 6in. ,, 2ft. 3in. 416 ,, 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 2,558 ,, There were 29 new gullies formed, which made the total up to this year 945. The cost of the sewer works was £924 11s. 8d. 1864 was the year in which Burdett Road was taken to by the Vestry, by an arrangement with the Metropolitan Board of Works. The other streets taken to in this year were Cologne-street, Bruges-street, and Bale-street. The total length being 3,830 feet. The sewers constructed in this year were Size of Sewer. Length. 2ft. 6in. by 2ft. 3m. 1,675 feet. 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 4,503 ,, The reconstruction of the sewer in the Mile End Road, between Globe Road and Assembly Passage, was effected. The old levels were found to be irregular, and that Charrington's brewery being two feet below the two points of discharge, causing a perpetual deposit which required a considerable annual expenditure to remove. Following your Surveyor's advice, the whole of the sewer between the places mentioned was rebuilt; the fall being made both ways to Hannibal Road, and a new egg-shaped brick sewer constructed therein. The sewers were formed in various other streets, the total cost amounting to £1,179 3s. 6d. A large quantity of paving work was done in 1865, there being 44,094 superficial feet of 3 inch, and 16,859 of 2½ inch. The Mile End Koad, Stepney Green, and Burdett Road were the chief thoroughfares repaired. The cost of these works was £2,110 15s. 9d. Great difficulty was experienced this year in finding places for the deposit of slop, thus causing an increase in the cost of horse hire, which will be seen by reference to the tables annexed. The sewer works this year, costing £373 12s. 6d., were— Size of Sewer. Length. 3ft. 6in. by 2ft, 3m. 174 feet. 1ft. 3in. ,, 1ft. 3in. 600 ,, 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 2,300 ,, In consequence of some remarks made in the House of Commons by Sir William Fraser, which reflected upon the local bodies in the Metropolis, your Surveyor submitted a brief statement of the works executed by the Vestry up to this year, (1865) 77 together with the cost thereof; the chief items of which are 36,393 feet lineal of kerb; r,1118,613 feet superficial of paving; 126,805 lineal feet of pipe sewers and drains; and 16,530 lineal feet of new brick sewers. The Vestry expended £160,000, besides borrowing on the security of the rates £10,000. 1866. Considerable paving works were carried out at a cost of £1,392 11s. 10d. The new streets taken to were Regent Street South, (since with Regent Street incorporated under the name Maplin Street), John Street, Albion Street, Carter Street, and Goodman's Road, being an addition of 1,900 lineal feet to the Roads of the Hamlet. Several streets had new sewers during the year, the quantities being of— Size of Sewer. Length. 3ft. 6in. by 2ft. 3im. 1,000 feet. 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 1,300 ,, It was in this year that your Surveyor drew up a report on the sanitary condition of the Hamlet owing to the anticipated visitation of Cholera, the most important particulars of which were — “With regard to the general sewerage and drainage of the Hamlet, I am enabled to say that there is not a house in the Hamlet which has not the means of drainage into a sewer, although in some few instances it occurs that there is not a sufficient sewer immediately in front. These instances are few, and are in course of being remedied. "The state of our sewers, gullies, ventilating shafts, and in many cases the house drains communicating therewith, is, to my mind, not satisfactory." Your Surveyor then quotes from a report of his own. "It is within your knowledge that a very large number of closets have been connected with the sewers without being provided with water supply, the consequence of which is that the sewers are never in as good sanitary condition as they would be if water supply were in all cases enforced." During the year 1867 no considerable paving works were completed. The new streets made up and taken to, were, Calverley Street, Floriston Street, Copley Street, Carlton Road, Wentworth Road, lengthening the mileage of roads by 2,780 feet. On the 1st November, 1866, the Act of Parliament authorising the Trustees of the Middlesex and Essex turnpike roads to levy tolls terminated, and the maintenance of the road as a highway devolved upon the various parishes through which it passed. 78 The abolition of the toll caused a marked difference in the traffic of the back streets, which were largely used in order to avoid the toll. The main thoroughfare therefore had to bear more traffic, and the smaller sank into the position of the ordinary roads of the Hamlet. At the expiration of the Act, a large balance remained in the hands of the Trustees, a large portion of which was by the Trustees with Mr. E. L. Johnson, expended in laying down pitchings in various parts of the Mile End Road, effecting a saving to the ratepayers of this Hamlet of over £1000. Sewers were constructed in a great number of streets at a cost of £1,439 13s. 6d., and new gullies built. The following will show the quantity of each description of sewer during the year.— Size of Sewer. Length. 3ft. 6in. by 2ft. 3m. 2,020 feet. 1ft. 3in. ,, 1ft. 3in, 1,100 ,, lft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 1in. 2,435 " 1868. A total quantity of 32,307 feet of paving was laid, the greater part in Burdett Road. A few streets were made up and taken to, the total length being 1,570. The sewer works of this year was small, the chief item being of— Size of Sewer. Length. 1ft. 1in. by 1ft. 1in. 800 feet. 221 houses were connected with the sewers in this year. During the 1869, 27,154 feet superficial of paving was laid at a cost of £"1,017 3s, 10d. Several new streets were made up in this year, and a larger area by the Trustees of the Cotton Estate, and all taken to increasing the length of the roads of the Hamlet by 6,240 feet. By an arrangement with the Great Eastern Railway made in the spring of 1868, by me, a saving of £224 18s. 0d. on the outlay of the preceding year was made. The new sewers laid were — Size of Sewer. Length. 1ft. 6in. by 1ft. 6in. 663 feet. 1ft. 3in. „ 1ft. 3in. 850 ,, 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 550 ,, In 1870 a most important work was performed in the Mile End Road, not at the cost, but under the immediate supervision of myself as representative of the Paving Committee, in the shape of 79 the North Metropolitan Tramway, the first in London of a new system of street tramways. This work has been a great benefit to the Hamlet, inasmuch as the Company are bound by a clause of their Act, " to pave, and at all times to keep paved, the roadway within their rails, and 18 inches on each side thereof, The amount of paving laid by the Company in pursuance of this clause, available for all traffic, was 12,401 superficial yards, relieving the Vestry of a cost of £6,231 1s. 6d. A number of the entrances to streets leading from the Mile End Road, were improved by laying the paving which formerly filled the space occupied by the tramway. It was in this year that the improvement of White Horse Lane was consumated. Two roads were made up at the cost of the owners of the property, and taken to by the Vestry. The addition to the thoroughfare of the Hamlet being 1,059 lineal feet. The quantity of new sewers laid during the year was of— Size of Sewer. Length. 3ft. 6in. by 2ft. 3m. 390 feet. 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in, 1,060 ,, 1871.—The first portion of the Mile End Road was paved this year, with pitching purchased from the Commissioners of Sewers The difference between the cost, if new, and that of the stone laid was £684 2s. od. An old sewer in the footway of the Mile End Road, on the north side, which had been an annoyance to the inhabitants for some time, in consequence of its having given way in several places, was demolished. Several new sewers were laid at a cost of £1,066 19s. 2d., the amount of which was of— Size cf Sewer. Length. 3ft. 6in. by 2ft. 3m. 1,420 teet. 1ft. 6in. ,, 1ft. 6in. 485 ,, 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 650 ,, In August, 1871, the Commercial Road Trust Act expired, and the road then came under the control of the Vestry. A tramway had already been placed there. The sewer works in the next year were— Size of Sewer. Length. 15in. pipe. 600 feet. 12in. ,, 420 „ 1873. The major portion of the paving done this year was 8o not at the Vestry's expense. The Tramway Company have laid pitching over the whole area of Grove Road, which is in this Parish, the centre of Commercial Road, and also the wide space lying between their rails at the entrance to Burdett Road from Mile End Road. 2,241 feet were added to the space available for the traffic in the Hamlet. The sewers constructed in 1873 were of— Size of Sewer. Length. 3ft. 6in. by 2ft. 3in. 780 feet. 3ft. 6in. ,, 2ft. 3in. 900 ,, 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in 1,621 ,, 1874. The most important of all the Vestry's work in paving was completed in this year; that of the Commercial and Mile End Roads, the cost of which works together with the relaying of the old stone taken from the main thoroughfare in the by-ways, White Horse Lane, Bancroft Place, etc., was £26,306 6s. gd. Another feature of the paving of this year was the asphalte laid in the Mile End Road, by the Val de Travers Co., and the Societe francaise des Asphaltes, the area being 5,330 superficial yards at a cost of £1,062 12s. 4d.. The sewer work was small.— Size of Sewer. Length. 1ft. 3in. by 1ft. 3in. 520 feet. 1ft. 0in. „ 1ft. 0in. 928 ,, In 1875 no important matter was taken in hand. The details of lighting, watering, etc., are given in the tables. The length of sewe s formed during the year was of— Size of Sewer. Length. 1ft. 6in by 1ft. 6in. 600 feet. 1ft. 3m. „ 1ft. 3in. 295 „ 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 329 ,, During the year 1876 a great difficulty was experienced in finding places for the deposit of the street refuse, owing to the action of the Great Eastern Railway, who closed their gates against the carts of the Vestry after a notice of 48 hours. For a week in January there was no land at the disposal of the Vestry for the reception of the slops which had to be shot temporarily into barges. I made a suggestion at the time for advantageous arrangements by which the refuse should be conveyed to the Hackney Marshes, which has since been acted upon. No important paving work was executed. That in the sewers department being 560 feet run of 12 inch pipe. 81 1877, The Vestry made up, at the expense of the owners 0 the property and took to a total length of roadway of 738 feet. A new brick sewer was placed in Lincoln Street in this year, the other sewer work was— Size of Sewer. Length. 3ft. 6in. by 2ft. 3m. 650 feet. 1ft. 3in. ,, 1ft. 3in. 191 ,, 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 624 ,, Four new side entrances were constructed in the Commercial Road, the cost being shared by the Vestry and the Tramway Company, the amount paid by the Vestry being £117 10s. od. 1878. In this year the Vestry purchased from the Beverley Iron Company a fifteen ton steam roller, made by Messrs, Aveling and Porter, for the sum of £400. The necessity for the possession of a steam roller by the Vestry had long been felt, as the hire of one from the neighbouring Vestries entailed a great expense. A comparison of the cost of the working of the roller and that of hiring will be found under the year 1880, together with the amount received from other parishes for the use of our own. The cost of rolling in 1878 was £241 4s. 2d, The most important sewer work of the year was the demolition of the old sewer lying in the rear of the houses in Cambridge Heath Road. This was done at the joint cost of this Vestry and Bethnal Green; the.centre of the old sewer being then the boundary between the two parishes. The other work was — Size of Sewer. Length. 1ft. 3in. by 1ft. 3in. 76 feet. 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 169 ,, Cambridge Heath Road—529ft. run brick sewer. 8,268 feet of Victoria stone were laid in 1879 various parts of the Hamlet, at a cost of £371 16s. 1d. This stone had proved satisfactory in other places. Two important street improvements were carried out this year, one at the eastern end of Oxford Street, and the other at the Western end of Diamond Row. The amount of claims made by freeholders and copyholders in Oxford Street was £3,514, and the amounts settled in respect of such claims was £3,197. The amount claimed by tenants was £*485, and that settled to be paid £325. The amounts of claims of copyholds in Diamond Row Was £570, and the amount settled to be paid £487. The tenants claim was £100, and the amount agreed to be paid by you was £50. f 82 In 1879 the re-construction of a sewer in Oxford Street and Richardson Street was begun. It had been in an unsatisfactory state for many years. The cost of sewer works was £1,043 17S. 9d. 1880. During this year the steam roller worked for the Vestry 127 days, which would have cost, if hired, the sum of £317 10s, The Vestry received from the adjoining parishes for the use of it £313 17s, 6d. The total cost of working, repairs, wages, and fuel, was £275 10s. 6d. The sewer work constructed was— Size of Sewer. Length. 1ft. 3in. by 1ft. 3m. 118 feet. 1ft. 0in. ,, 1ft. 0in. 505 ,, The cost of cleansing the principal sewers of the Hamlet for this year was £448 18s. 1881. It was necessary to replace the portion of the paving on the north side of Commercial Road, between a point short of the "George Public House" and the western boundary, part of the road repaired by the Vestry. The New Road, by the ordinary wear, required repaving. The portion of the Commercial Road above referred to was paved by the Tramway Company and represented the compensation to the St. George's Vestry, which they were entitled to under the Tramway Act, and which this Vestry had the benefit of when they arranged to keep this part of the road in repair for the St. George's Vestry, they taking in exchange, an equal area at the western end of the road. The cost of these works was £2,749 16s. During the year the steam roller worked for the Vestry 176 days, which would have cost, if hired, the sum of £440. TheVestry received for hire of roller from adjoining parishes the sum of £167 5s. The total cost of working, repairs, wages, and fuel, was £262 15s. 6d. 375 cubic yards of soil were removed from the sewers, the cost of cleansing being £700 19s. 1d. In 1882 considerable foot paving work was done in Stepney Green and Commercial Road. The cost being £971 9s. 9d. Tees Scoriae was first used for channels, 3,600 blocks being laid. Bancroft Road was the principal street laid. It is found after nearly two years wear that this extract from the iron furnaces of the Cleveland district is in the same condition as when first laid. Seventeen new gullies were built this year. 734 cubic yards of soil were removed from the sewers. The cost of cleaning being £600 19s. 1d. 83 The steam roller worked for the Vestry 118 days, which would have cost, if hired, £295. The Vestry received from adjoining parishes and London and North Western Railway Company, the sum of £260 11s. 8d. The cost for working, repairs, wages, and fuel, was £343 0s. 9d.

SUMMARY of the woRK PERFORMED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND Sanitary Department, FROM THE PASSING OF THE METROPOLIS MANAGEMENT ACT (1855), TO THE PRESENT TIME. By Matthew Corner, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. with: various tables. LONDON: penny & hull, printers, leman street, whitechapel, e. 1883. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Re Metropolis Local Management Acts. Gentlemen. In accordance with a resolution of your Board passed on February 8th, 1882, it devolves upon me to submit to you a summary report of the efforts which have been so successfully made during recent years to improve the sanitary condition and promote the public health of the Hamlet. To do this within a reasonable compass will require great compression of the materials from which the Summary is drawn, but this must not be taken to imply that a very large amount of work has not been done, for the details of which, reference may be made to the very numerous reports which I have submitted to the Vestry, and to other notes and memoranda in my own possession, which are, from the nature of the duties of the Medical Officer, of a very varied kind, bearing upon whatever appertains to his functions. Summary Report The Act of 1855 found the Hamlet inhabited by a population of 61,500, distributed over an area of 681 acres, dwelling in about 10,000 habitations; the densely populated centres being bordered by open spaces, since built upon. 1856 Population in 1855 The earliest official record in my department is a report dated February 12th, 1856, in which the Medical Officer of Health (Mr. Freeman) complains of accumulations of manure and refuse in 1st Report Feb. 12th, 1856. various open spaces, and of detective drainage, &c., nuisances which were dealt with by the Vestry, and abated. Nuisances dealt with A large number of places were during the same year visited among them — Places visited Raven's Premises, Church Row. Young's ,, Mile End Road. Houses in One Mile Row. ,, Fairfield Street. ,, Stepney Green. ,, Mulberry Street. ,, White Horse Court. ,, Edgar Place. ,, Rural Place. ,, Victoria Place. ,, Diamond Row, In all of these the drainage was improved, or the nuisances removed, and repairs or alterations recommended, or ordered to be done. 92 1856 Places visited continued Letter from the Vestry of Ratcliif Tower Hamlets Cemetery All the slaughter-houses were also reported on. It appears that from February to June, 300 private dwellings were inspected, besides a number of premises where various trades, liable to be offensive, were carried on. And during the same year a letter received from the Vestry of Ratcliff, led to the co-operation of the Medical Officer for that district, with your own Medical Officer, with reference to certain nuisances on the boundary of the parishes, which were efficiently dealt with. A lengthened and troublesome enquiry also was made into the origin of offensive odours alleged to arise from the Tower Hamlets Cemetery, which were subsequently traced to some operations of the Central Gas Company. Four cases, where it was necessary to invoke the powers of the law, were heard at Arbour Street Police Court. Mortality rate No accurate figures relative to the mortality rates can be given for this year, (1856) as no returns were furnished by the Registrar to the Vestry until the beginning of the following year, the first five weeks of which show the weekly average of deaths as 33. 1857 During the year 1857 the Medical Umcer visited, at tne request of the Sanitary Committee, or the Inspector, and reported thereon. Places visited Ivy and Francis Cottages, Glyn Road; Clayton's Cottages, New Street; Johnson's Property, Regent's Street; Regent's Court; Walmley's Factory ; Pugh's Factory, and Park Road. WestWrd. mortality In all these cases nuisances were ordered to be removed, and the sanitary condition improved. The West Ward was reported on as being in a serious state, the mortality being five per cent. during the first nine months of the year. Some cases of Cholera were also reported, which were found however to be "English'' Cholera, and three cases of Typhus. 1853 Places visited Manure works During the year 1858, the following places were inspected, a number of them being complained of as occasioning nuisances from the business of pig keeping and the slaughtering of animals; West Street, Old Church Road, Knight's premises, Grove Street, Mulberry Tree, Stepney Green, Mapp's Row, New Street, West Street, and Bow Common Lane. All slaughter-houses were again visited and reported upon. Some offensive manure works having resisted the Vestry's recommendation, recourse to legal measures was threatened, with the effecft desired. An instance occurred of a complaint being made which could not be upheld.— It was that of a manufacturer of lake and chrome yellow in Edward Street, which was ultimately dismissed on the Medical Officer's recommendation. 1859 The records for the year 1859 are of a similar character to those of 1858. Premises in John's Place, Gardner's Field, Vincent 93 Street, Grove Street, Plummer's Row, Bow Common Lane, York Place, New Road, East Street, and Mulberry Court were inspected, and many nuisances reported on and dealt with. Many cesspools were abolished, and one well disused. Places visited During the year 1860 there were inspected dwellings and factories in John's Place, Pedley's Orchard, Windsor Terrace, York Place, Bischoff's premises, Bow Common Lane, Assembly Row, Essex Street, Small and Austin's Works, Bow Common Lane, Huggin's Factory, Dempsey Street,— several of these more than once. Most of these cases were of defective drainage, and want of sanitary arrangements, while some had to do with offensive trades. All the slaughter-houses were visited. Cesspools 1860 Places visited Defective drainage The year 1861 presents much the same sort of records as its predecessor. Westlake's and Pugh's premises, Bow Common Lane, Wilson's and Fletcher's in Jubilee Street, two cases of pig keeping in Devonshire Street, Molloy's Pickle Factory in Sidney Street, and some cases of bad drainage in Lincoln Street, South Grove, &c., occur in the reports, with records of improvements, and nusiances abolished or abated. 1861 Places visited In 1862, visits were paid to Princes Street, Commodore Terrace, Ton's blood boiling premises, Bow Common Lane, Rigby's, Mile End Road, the "Three Mackerel" public house, the Canal Road, Austin's, Bow Common Lane, eighteen houses in Beaumont Square, Pugh's premises, Johnson's ditto, Canal Road, together with all the cow-houses and slaughter-houses. The Medical Officer attending at the Sessions House, to oppose the granting of a cow-house license to a cow-keeper who had neglected to make required alterations. 1862 Places visited Cow license During 1863, the Medical Officer inspected Wilson and Fletcher's works, Johnson's grain drying works, and a number of piggeries, one of the owners of which was fined for refusing to comply with the legal conditions of his business. In other cases the piggeries were closed. Cases of over-crowding and defective drainage were reported from White Horse Lane, Mile End Place, and Silver Street, &c. One hundred and five bakeries were visited. 1863 Places visited Piggeries During 1864 visits were paid, re defective drainage and water supply, to Rodney Terrace, Heath Street, Fair Street, White Horse Lane, Baker's manure works, York Street School, Johnson's premises, Canal Road, Ton's blood boiling works, Union Place, James Street, Railway Place, Austin's premises, Bow Common Lane,—in many instances more than once. Several summonses were issued tor pig keeping. 70 applicants sent notice of their intention to seek licenses for cow-sheds and slaughter-houses, and all their premises were examined, 23 being found defective, and required to be put in order. Bakeries 1864 Cowsheds 94 1865 Fines Cow keeping Visits were paid in 1865 to Johnson's premises, Bow Common Lane, Ton's factory, Frost's slaughter-house, and a number of similar places reported to occasion nuisances, and to many private houses re defective drainage. Several cases were brought before the Magistrate and fines inflicted. 67 applications for Cow-keeping licenses occurred, whereof eleven were to stand over for repairs to premises. 1866 Places visited Cholera epidemic Committee formed Nuisances suppressed Cholera mortality During 1866 the Medical Officer visited Ton's premises, Westover Street, New Street, Railway Place, and many other dwellings and factories, but the ordinary work of the department was cast into the shade by the Cholera Epidemic, which commenced in Bromley, on July 12th, and rapidly spread over the Hamlet. (At this critical juncture, owing to the serious illness of Mr. Freeman, the Vestry did me the honor to appoint me Acting Medical Officer of Health, and subsequently upon his decease, in the same year, elected me to the vacant office.) On this subject of the cholera epidemic voluminous reports lie before me, which can only be touched upon in this Summary. A Special Committee was at once formed, which held 24 sittings, and relieved 7,715 patients. Infected bedding and clothing were destroyed. Printed notices, giving directions, were largely circulated. Your Medical Officer presented reports to each Committee meeting, showing that on the whole 11,000 houses had been visited, upwards of 100 of which were ordered to have their drainage connected with the main sewers. In a very large number of cases, nuisances dangerous to health were summarily disposed of, and extensive paving works ordered. Suggestions were made and carried out for the total suppression of everything likely to injure health or encourage the epidemic. The total mortality from Cholera and Diarrhœa in Mile End, from July 16th, to October 15th, is shown below: the population being estimated at 50,000 for the Eastern, and 35,000 for the Western sub-districts: the death rate from Cholera being 6.18 per 1000 for the former, and 6.15 for the latter. Deaths. Cholera. Diarrhoea. Total. Western Division 182 30 218 From London Hospital 21 0 21 Eastern Division 290 47 337 From London Hospital 19 0 19 Total 512 83 595 95 A Government enquiry was, during the epidemic, instituted into the condition of the water supplied by the East London Water Company, and especially as regarded the underground reservoir at Old Ford, which the Vestry helped to bring to a conclusion calculated to promote the public health, ordering that, wherever practicable, water-waste preventers should be used. East London Water Company During this year numerous orders for disinfecting dwellings were issued. The Medical Officer reporting danger to health arising from building upon sites not properly prepared, it was ordered that the attention of the Metropolitan Board of Works be called thereto. Houses in James Street, Old Church Road, Essex Street, Mile End Place, Richardson Fields, Bedford Square, York Place, Cannon Place, Church Passage, Robert's Place, Charles Court, Edward Street, Weston Street, and many factory works were inspected, with recommendations to cleanse, repair, &c. Vaccination was ordered in many cases. The water supplied by the East London Water Works was reported comparatively pure. 1867 Disinfecting orders Places visited During this year, in consequence of complaints made, the Tower Hamlets Cemetery was inspected by a Committee, and the Medical Officer reported insufficiency of earth in covering the coffins, and in separating them. Much controversy between the Cemetery authorities and the Vestry resulted in a conference with a favourable issue. Tower Hamlets Cemetery Several cases occurred where unwholesome meat was destroyed, one dealer therein being convicted. This led to your Medical Officer's making a report upon food adulteration, especially as regards butter. Unwholesome meat All cow-sheds and slaughter-houses were inspected. Complaint having been made regarding a dead body in a room in Thomas Street, occasion was taken to recommend that a mortuary should be provided. Many cases of infectious diseases, and some of cholera being reported, vigorous means were adopted for preventing their spread. There are numerous records this year of cases of overcrowding. Cow sheds &c. Mortuary Overcrowding The records of this year show visits paid to many houses and factories, including gas works, chemical works, manure yards, fish curing premises, cow-sheds, and slaughter-houses, in Frimley Street, Robert's Place, John's Place, Wellesley Street, Union Street, South Grove, George Place, Essex Street, Commercial Road, and the Vintner's Almshouses. 1868 Places visited The Regent's Canal Company was communicated with to stay contamination to the water complained of, with good results. The Government Inspector was in correspondence with your Medical Officer of Health re the Tower Hamlets Cemetery. Regent's Canal 96 1868 Disinfecting apparatus Gas A disinfecting apparatus was fitted up at the Workhouse. The gas was reported on as above the statute standard. The East London Company's water was compared favourably with that of other companies, 26½ gallons being on the average supplied to each Drains person, including factories, &c. A number of old drains were closed. 1869 Places visited Reports occur this year of visits paid in Silver-street, Longfellow-road, Eaton-place, Lady Lake's-grove, Mile-end-road,Grovestreet, Regent-street, Edward-street, White Horse-lane, Hayfieldpassage, Ernest-street, Essex-street, Exmouth-street, Mary-street, Washington-street, and Globe-road, in many of which places scarlet fever and small pox were prevalent. Unvaccinated children Unvaccinated children were ordered to be vaccinated. Special reports 1870 Special reports were made on various subjects (e g.) Artizans' Dwellings, scarlatina, gas, sanitation, diphtheria, &c. small-pox Reports A number of cases of small-pox occurred this year, and there are many reports in this connection, as well as upon scarlatina, vaccination, and preventive measures generally. Infection Ward Places visited Wards were provided for infected patients, which were largely used. Visits of inspection were paid to Lichfield-road, Mulberrystreet, Canal-road, Toilet-street, East-street, Henry-street, Longfellow-road, Portman-place, Plummer's-row, Heath-street, Devonshire-street, Grafton-street, &c. Numerous visits were paid also to factories and yards, where offensive trades were carried on. 1871 Small-pox Special Hospital This year also is notable for the prevalence of fever and smallpox in the Hamlet, and special meetings of the Health Committee were held, circulars being sent to the medical practitioners to ascertain their views as to the epidemics, and especially with regard to providing a suitable special hospital. It was shown that within 14 days 108 cases of small-pox were treated, and a great many un-vaccinated children were by this means discovered. Circular letters Letters were sent to the ministers of religion on the subject. Places visited Numerous enquiries were made, and reports handed in bearing upon this matter, and measures for prevention which can only be here touched upon. The following were among places inspected: houses in Charles-street, Nottingham-place, Little Union-street, Allars-road, Essex-street, Bancroft-road, Mile End-road, John'splace, Sampson's-court, Latimer-street. The Regent's Canal was also reported upon, and cow-sheds, slaughter-houses, &c., inspected. 1872 Places visited This year's records are not so voluminous, the epidemic having abated. Many houses were however visited, and their sanitation improved, in John's place, Prospect-place, James-street, Pattersonstreet, &c. Keeping of pigs was ordered in some cases to be given 97 up; several manufacturing nuisances abolished; slaughter-houses and cow-sheds inspected. In 1873 many unhealthy houses were reported upon in Plummer's-row, Baker-street, New-street, Globe-road, &c. Enteric fever was very prevalent. A special report in this matter was prepared, and instructions printed for the public guidance. A number of factories were again inspected, and the East London water reported upon as not up to the standard of other water companies. 1873 Places visited Enteric fever East London Water Company This year was marked by a scarlet fever epidemic, for the repression of which co-operation was sought with the London School Board. Trade nuisances were abated in a number of cases, and premises and dwellings were inspected in Plummer's-row, Baker-street, New-street, Globe-road, Old Church-road, Stepneygreen, Bale-street, Ben Jonson-road, White Horse-lane, Johnstreet, Mulberry-gardens, York-terrace, Regent's-road, and Mile End-road. Reports occur upon the water supply, and cow-sheds, and slaughter-houses. 1874 Scarlet fever Places visited Reports The year 1875 presents no salient features, the work of the department proceeding in its usual course. Inspection was made and reports drawn up, re complaints respecting Holy Trinity Churchyard, ditto some piggeries near the South Grove Board School, ditto some feather dressing works in the Commercial-road, and in a number of instances proceedings were taken under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act. All the cow-sheds and slaughter-houses were inspected, and visits were paid in Turner'sroad, Upper York-place, James-street, Essex-street, Ben Jonsonroad, Hertford-street, York-street, Russell-street, Nelson-street, and Mile End Road. 1875 HolyTrinityChurch Yard Piggeries Artizans', &c.,Dwellings Act Places visited Reports upon small-pox, vaccination, and scarlet fever, occur in this year's record, and many cases were removed to the Hospital upon the Medical Officer's certificate, and the Asylum's Board was asked to co-operate with the Board of Guardians. 1876 Small pox &c. Among other places visited, independently of special calls to houses infected, were New-street, St. Thomas'-road, Dempseystreet, Brunswick-place, Greenfield-street, Charles-street, Princes street, Burdett-road, Wilson-street, Canal-road, Railway-place, Longfellow-road, and Joseph-street. Numerous cases of overcrowding occurred in this year's records, and nuisances arising from offensive trades. Places visited Overcrowding This year's records contain a number of reports upon the prevalence of small-pox, scarlet fever, and typhoid fever, which occasioned special enquiries, and the suppression of over-crowding 1877 Smallpox, &c. 98 Circulars Places visited Overcrowding Co-operation in some of the wards. Circulars were sent to all the medical practitioners on two or three separate occasions, and measures vigorously taken, the details of which may be found in your Medical Officer's long special report, which, conveying as it does a portion of the succeeding year, can only be touched upon here. A tabular statement of the work done, and the serious nature of the occasion, is appended. It would be difficult, says the report, to estimate the disease prevented and the valuable lives saved by the prompt measures taken. Ordinary inspections were this year made in Essexstreet, Heath-street, Charlotte-street, Antcliff-street, Henry-street, Ben Jonson-road, Raven's-row, Silver-street, Oxford-street, Patterson-street, Robert's-place, Bow-common-lane, Exmouth-street, Copley-street, and Burdett-road. Most of these cases were of overcrowding, defective sanitation, and trade nuisances.

Small-pox and typhoid fever still prevailed to a serious extent this year, rendering the utmost vigilance still necessary. Numerous reports are among the records of 1878, containing details concerning house-to-house visitation, schools visitations, and proceedings under the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Act. Places visited Special reports Inspection was made of cow sheds and slaughterhouses, and some alleged tainted food. Ordinary visits were paid in Ben Jonsonroad, Eagle-place, Charles-street, Redman's-row, Yalford-street, Harford-street, Longnor-road, and Essex-street; mostly cases, as before, of overcrowding. Measures for removing rubbish, &c., were considered throughout the Hamlet. For further particulars, which are very extensive, reference may be made to the special reports of the year, in one of which reference is made to your Surveyor Mr. Knight's ingenious and effective fumigating and disinfecting apparatus. The Board School in Harford Street, was 99 closed for a fortnight after the new year, that it might be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. The Board of Guardians rendered every possible assistance to the Vestry, and the relieving officer's services were of the highest value. Many cases of typhoid fever and scarlet fever occurred this year; and the work of sanitation and disinfecting was pursued. The year's records present many instances, as usual, of overcrowding, dilapidated dwellings, and unwholesome premises. Two wells were closed and several trade nuisances dealt with. Co-operation was effected with the various school authorities, re prevalence of scarlet fever. Visits were paid in Sidney-street, Heath-street, Commodore-street, Charles-street, Coutts'-road, Wilson-street, Waldenstreet, Old Church-road, Medway-road, Burdett-road, Canal-road, Whitechapel-road, Victoria-place, Oxford-street, Raven-terrace Turner's-road, Baker-street, Redman's-road, Carlton-road, Skidmore-street, Nelson-street, Bridge-street, Harford-street, Bedfordstreet, Greenfield-street, Floreston-street, Lincoln-street, and Commercial-road. Cow byres and slaughterhouses inspected. 1879 Typhoid fever, &c. Overcrowding Co-operation Places visited Small-pox, typhoid and scarlet fever, still prevailed during this year, concerning which many special reports were made, which can only be mentioned here. After long correspondence with the Boards of Guardians of Poplar, Limehouse and Whitechapel, the Vestry resolved to send non-pauper small-pox cases to Highgate Hospital, at a cost of four guineas for each patient during treatment. Seven cases were sent accordingly during the year, ending March, at a cost of £29. Visits of inspection were paid to Bow Common-lane, New-road, Redman's-row; Cadiz-street, Clevelandstreet, Selina-terrace, New-street, Robert's-place, Carr-street, Edward's-road, Ernest-street, Maplin-street, Ocean-street, Emmettstreet, St. Peter's-street, Regent's-court, Union-street, Charlesstreet, Stepney-green, Copperfield-road, and Thomas-street. Several offensive trade nuisances were suppressed, and proceedings taken under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act. The Hospital at Barking was inspected and reported upon. Two cases of un-coffined bodies were summarily dealt with. A schoolhouse in the New-road was ordered to have the drainage made good. The Board's ambulance was inspected and found unsuitable. A number of orders were made to provide proper water supply. 1880 Smallpox, &c. Highgate Hospital Places visited Hospital at Barking Dead bodies Ambulance Water supply The epidemic of small-pox still continuing, your medical officer caused full enquiry to be made in each case, so far as practicable, and the result submitted to him. Foot and mouth disease being 100 Enteric fever East London Water Company Dead bodies Regent's canal Places visited reported by the Metropolitan Board of Works, notice was sent to each proprietor of cows in the Hamlet, cautioning against the use of the cows' milk in any suspected cases. The East London Company's water supply was reported on during the year from month to month, A special ward was provided for small-pox patients, all the hospitals being full. The records of this year are very full of small-pox reports, and a number of cases of enteric fever occurred. A tabular Statement is appended, affording a classified view of the cases removed to Hospitals. Representations were made to the East London Water Works Company on the danger to the public health arising from withdrawing the water supply, in consequence of non-payment of rent, which had been done in 39 cases within a period of eight weeks. Several instances occurred of dead bodies, unburied within a reasonable time, being summarily removed. The water of the Regent's Canal was reported on. Notices were served upon parents of unvaccinated children, a list being supplied to the vaccination officer. The following places were visited, principally in re-drainage and nuisances:—Burdettroad, Rhodeswell-road, James-street, Skidmore-street, Ernest-street, Settles-street, Weighbridge-place, Redman's-road, Myrdle street, Rutland-street, Charles-street, Jamaica-street, St. Peter's-road, Coborn-road, King-street, Diggon-street, Wellesley-street, Commercial-road, Globe-road, Jubilee-street, York-place, Harfordstreet, and Yalford-street.

A large number of dwellings were inspected, and reports made thereon, with a view to proceedings under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act. The St. Thomas' National Schools, in Arbour-street, were visited, and the attention of the managers called to certain defects in their sanitary condition, water supply, &c. An appendix is added, containing the various reports of your Medical Officer, re the above-named Act. The following places were visited:—Murdoch-cottages, Russell-street, St. Paul'-road, Turner's-road, Ocean-street, Ben Jonson-road, Pedley's-orchard, Jubilee-street, Stepney-green, Jamaica-street, Yalford-street, St. Anne's-road, Mile End-road, and Eagle passage. 103 Artizans' and Lacourers' Dwellings Act, 1868. The Medical Officer has reported, under the provisions of this Act, upon sixteen separate-occasions, in respect of the following dwellings, viz.:— Artizans' and labourers' dwellings Act, 1868 Nos. 1 to 10, Eaton-place, White Horse-lane. „ 1 to 4, Cottage-place, Lady Lake's-grove. „ 1 to 9, Upper York-place. „ 1 to 10, Cottage-court, Hayfield-passage.

No. 1, Ben Jonson-road. Nos. 1 to 6, Regent's-court, and 54 and 56, Maplin-street. „ 1 to 9, Upper York-place; and 100 and 102, Harford- street, and 14 to 17 Pedley's-orchard. „ 1 to 6, Weighbridge-place. „ 14 to 17, Pedley's-orchard. „ 1 to 13 and 18 to 24, Pedley's-orchard. And Nos. 1 to 3, leading thereto. In all these cases the Medical Officer's reports were referred to the Surveyor to the Vestry, according to the terms of the Act, and his recommendations have been generally ultimately carried out. Recommendati'n enforced by Vestry The Sanitary Committee have made 131 special surveys during the 26 years of this Summary Report, and have held 504 ordinary meetings. A Mortality Table is appended, shewing the good results which have accrued from the work of the local authority in this department. Sanitary committee work In concluding this much-condensed statement of the work done by the Medical Officer's department of the Hamlet, it would be unfair not to acknowledge the great advantage to the public health which has arisen from the action of the Metropolitan Board of Works in the matter, especially of the main drainage, and the share the Hamlet has had in this and other general metropolitan improvements. While this, however, is willingly conceded, as being indeed undeniable, your Medical Officer begs to avail himself of the opportunity this Report affords him of bearing hearty testimony to the readiness which has marked the reception of his varied and numerous recommendations to the local authority, in 104 regard to matters bearing upon the public health, and, therefore, upon the public immunity from disease, and the public comfort, convenience and well being. He desires emphatically to acknowledge that his efforts have been well supported; and he thinks the Vestry may congratulate themselves upon having done a great deal to advance hygiene in this densely populated part [of the metropolis, inhabited as it is so very largely by the poorer classes, among many of whom neglect of sanitary regulations is, unfortunately, habitual. Your Medical Officer would bear testimony, also, to the willing assistance he has received from many bodies and individuals outside your own body, who in times of stress from epidemics, dangerous to the population, have come forward to second his own efforts. Subjoined is a Statement of the population according to the census, showing the rate of decennial increase, with the quinquennial death rate per 1000 population living from the year 1856. Year. Decennial Population. Quinquenl. death-rate per 1000 pop ulation livg.

For cesspools and imperfect brick drains, an arterial system has been substituted, which is being at present extended to receive the overflow of excessive rainfall. Wells, mostly polluted, more or less, with sewage infiltration, have been closed, and an abundant provision of water, on the constant supply system, has been substituted. Great improvements have also been effected in the paving of the streets, in the provision of dust bins and abolition of dust heaps, both in the back yards of the houses and such open spaces as used to offer temptation for the deposit of offensive and injurious rubbish 105 The visible effects of the work of the Medical Officer's department can, of course, never be put into competition with those of other departments, in which works carried out tell their own tale of progress. The unseen and often obscure causes of disease work their way underground, so to speak, at all events unobserved, until they assume visible and often dangerous and fearful shape, and when, after anxious efforts, the disease has abated, the remembrance of these efforts remains only in the memory and records of those who have made them. That general sanitary measures persistently carried out may do much for the promotion of health, and the abatement of disease, the experience of the past 26 years in the public work of this department abundantly proves. It only remains to recommend a continuance of the same vigilance and the same care. Any relaxation in this respect is sure to be visited with its inexorable retribution, for the germs of disease can as easily be encouraged and fostered by neglect, as they may by prudence and suitable measures of sanitation, be rendered innoxious, if not entirely stamped out, or abolished. Your Medical Officer refrains from offering any suggestions as to the future, the terms of the Resolution of the Vestry not calling upon him to do so. He would conclude, therefore, his imperfect Summary with the expression of the deep interest he has always entertained in promoting the work of his department for the public well being; and, in thanking the Vestry for the confidence they have reposed in him, which they have exhibited by the willingness they have always shown, and more especially during the prevalence of the serious epidemics, herein briefly recorded, to carry out his recommendations, offered under a deep sense of responsibility to themselves and to the entire community of the Hamlet. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. 128, Mile End Road, January, 1883.

In presenting their Annual Report for the year ending the 25th March, 1883, the Vestry must premise it by intimating that there have not been any works of very great magnitude proposed in any department, but the Vestry has been engaged in considering and carrying out numerous projects, which, although attracting less attention, are equally necessary for the good management and well-being of the Hamlet. A perusal of the following Report and of the Reports of the Officers, which are appended thereto, will show what these have been. For the sake of convenience of comparison and reference, the Vestry, in preparing this report, have, as far as possible, followed the method and order adopted of late years. The number of Meetings of Vestry and Committees has been as follows:— MEETINGS. YEARS. REMARK. 1879-80. 1880-81. 1881-82. 1882-3. Vestry 25 23 22 22 *Excludling the Weekly Meeting of Dusting and Cleansing Committee at the Stables. Standing Committees 93 111 100* 108# Special „ 28 14 4 6 TOTAL 146 148 126 136 Meetings. The largest attendance at any Vestry meeting was 64; the smallest, 25; and the average, 44. The Vestry have to record the loss, by death and resignation, of no fewer than seven of its members. The deaths were of Mr. C. Moody, Mr. J. Pollard, and Mr. H. J. Jupp. The resignations were of Messrs. Abrahams, Noble, Tuckwell, and Cobb. Messrs. Moody and Pollard were two of the Vestrymen who were elected to the Vestry in 1855, and had continued to serve the Parish ever since that time. They had both taken most prominent positions in the local government; and the Vestry feel that by their death the Parish has sustained a great loss. Mrs. Firth, the Housekeeper, felt called upon, by ill-health, to resign her position; and the Vestry took into consideration her application for an allowance. The Committee to whom the matter was referred reported in favour of allowing her a gratuity of £10 and a weekly allowance of 3s. 4d., being the proportion of salary provided by statute in cases of Officers retiring from ill-health after more than 10 years' service. The matter was under consideration by the Vestry; but Mrs. Firth died on the Housekeeper. 6 day on which she was to leave the service of the Vestry. During the year, too, Mr. James Knight, the former Surveyor of the Vestry, and late a member of the Vestry, died. Appointment of Officers. In consequence of Mrs. Firth's resignation, the Vestry took into consideration the question of the propriety of having a man and his wife to live at the Vestry Hall, to take charge of it, and for the man to act as Porter. Upon going into the matter, it was found that, hitherto, a man had to be employed to clean the windows, and the Clerk reported that he frequently found it necessary to obtain a man to assist the Messenger in cases of emergency. It was also considered that it was hardly prudent to leave the Hall and its contents in the charge of one person. Taking all things into consideration, therefore, the Vestry determined to engage a man and his wife. The appointment was advertised in the usual way, and the Vestry appointed Mr. and Mrs. Gilnagh, at a salary of 25/- per week. Second Assistant Clerk. Mr. Alfred Greeves, who was appointed the Messenger, having completed eighteen months' service, applied for an increase of salary, and the Vestry increased it accordingly to 35/- per week; and, having regard to the appointment of Porter, the Vestry, at the same time, altered the designation of his office from that of Messenger to Second-Assistant Clerk. Churchwardens and Overseers Messrs. H. Cushen and B. Cundick were appointed Churchwardens, and Messrs. W. Wagg, J. D. Kemp, A. Prevost, and H. Glass Overseers, for the year 1882-3, Parliamentary. The Parliamentary Committee considered and reported on the following Bills before Parliament; and the Vestry took steps in relation thereto, as set out in the following List:— Subject Matter. Nature of Steps Taken. Metropolis Management, & c., Act (as amended) Petition against withdrawn. Income l ax Administration Petition in favour. Limehouse Subway London Riverside Fish Market (as passed by Committee) „ in favour to House of Lords. Petition to Commons to disagree with Lords' Amendments. Metropolis Eating of Footways Petition in favour. Metropolis Management, &c., Act (Public Bill) „ against. Electric Lighting „ for Amendment. Commonable Eights Commons, &c., Act Amendment Metropolitan Board of Works (Money) Local Government Provisional Orders (Artizans, &c., Act) Highway Eates and Expenditure Metropolitan Street Improvement Act(1877) Amendment Parochial Charities Artizans' Dwellings Petition for Amendment. 7 The most important of these were the Fish Market Bill and the Electric Lighting Bill. Fish Market Bill. As pointed out in the last Report, the Vestry considered it necessary to petition against the Fish Market Bill, in order to obtain clauses. The promoters agreed to clauses, among which were clauses (1) for having widenings at Hardinge Street and Devonport Street executed to satisfaction of Surveyor; (2) for preventing closing of streets; and (3) providing for superintendence of work; and for paving the carriage-ways of the widened portions. Of course, the usual protection clauses as to sewers, &c., were obtained. As will be seen by reference to the List, the Vestry, having obtained clauses, did its utmost to assist in the passing of the Bill, and it was ultimately passed. In addition to the advantages which, it is hoped, will result to the ratepayers of the Hamlet by the establishment of the Market itself, the Vestry consider that they have also secured material advantage to the Parish by the special clauses they obtained. As was anticipated, the Government took in hand the question of Electric Lighting, and passed one general Bill, designated the Electric Lighting Act, 1882. The Act is of a character which the Vestry venture to say was never before sanctioned in this country. It virtually hands over the whole power of legislation with regard to Electricity to the Board of Trade. Electric Lighting Bill. The Board of Trade are empowered to grant provisional orders, and to make rules as to the mode of proceeding to be adopted. Several companies gave notice of proceeding under the Act as regards this Hamlet, but only one (the "Brush" Company) carried out the requirements of the Board of Trade. The rules as issued by the Board of Trade were most difficult to understand, but, in effect, they provided that the Companies should deposit a draft of the provisional order, that notice with copy of the draft order and a plan showing the area proposed to be supplied should be served on the local authority, and then that the local authority should state their objections to the draft, and leave with the Board of Trade a draft showing the order which the local authority required. The Vestry considered that the matter was one of the greatest importance, and accordingly referred it to special committee of 30 members, consisting of the members of the Parliamentary and Highways Committees. The committee considered the question, and with the assistance of the clerk and surveyor, prepared (as invited by the Board of Trade) representations to that Board as to certain provisions which the committee considered should be inserted in every provisional order. Before these were submitted, the draft order of the Brush Company was served, and it at once became apparent that many additional objections would be required: (Firstly).—The Company proposed to take powers to supply electricity over areas far greater than their capital would enable them to do. (2.) That the streets would be 8 virtually at the mercy of the company, who might carry wires either over or underground; and (3) that the company proposed in the first instance to take only the cream of the parish as the area of immediate supply—but at the same time they virtually obtained a monopoly in the parish for a period of at least 2½-years. The Committee accordingly proceeded to examine the draft order of the company, and ultimately submitted a report to the Vestry, recommending no less than 77 specific objections, and representations to the Board of Trade. The Vestry adopted the Report. In March, the Board of Trade having had before it representations and objections from all parts of the country, itself issued model clauses. These were in many instances undoubtedly framed more in the interest of the local authorities, but the Board of Trade still remained supreme. The Committee most carefully went through the model clauses, and ultimately submitted 30 further suggestions and criticisms to the Board of Trade. It is apparent upon the face of things, that the Board of Trade itself feels that the subject being so comparatively little known at present is a most difficult matter to deal with. The Committee felt that the matter of Electric Lighting is being pushed on with undue speed, and in this the Vestry have concurred with them. It is desired that the Board of Trade should not sanction wholesale provisional orders to companies until some further knowledge is acquired, as it would be a great loss to the ratepayers if the action of the Electric Lighting Companies should in some places drive the Gas Gompanies to discontinue supply, and then the Electric Companies find themselves unable to perform their obligations. The Vestry have had sad experience in dealing with the Gas and Water Companies with regard to reinstating roads, and the Vestry desire if possible to obtain greater powers of dealing with Electric Lighting Companies in that respect. The matter is still under the consideration of the Board of Trade. Gas to Public Lamps. The Vestry having regard to many circumstances which came to their knowledge, deemed that a fitting time had arrived to communicate with the Commercial Gas Company with a view of obtaining a further reduction of the price charged for gas supplied for the public lamps. They accordingly did so, but the Company replied that having regard to the comparatively short time which had elapsed since the last reduction, they did not consider that the time had arrived. Dusting and Cleansing. During the year the Vestry with a view if possible to further relieve the ratepayers, determined to undertake the task of having the dust and rubbish sorted by its own servants, so as to make it into a merchantable commodity. The Great Eastern Railway having offered a site on which the sorting process 9 could be carried on, and also having granted an advantageous tariff of freight, the work was commenced in October last. As a matter of course, in the outset, there was considerable difficulty experienced, but notwithstanding all things a small margin of profit has been reported, and it is confidently hoped that in the future matters will be still more successful. In conjunction with the matter, the Vestry have hired an arch of the Railway Company to act as an office. The rent is £10 per annum. Although tenders are invited for the supply of corn and fodder for the keep of the Vestry's horses, no formal contract is entered into, and the Vestry therefore submit the following statement, showing the class of materials tendered for, the names of the persons whose tenders were accepted with the dates of acceptance, and the price agreed to be paid.

The Vestry are pleased to be able to report that in nearly every case referred to in former years they have succeeded in recovering the charge from the owners. Paving streets at expense of Owners. As pointed out in the last Report, the Vestry had made suggestions to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the renaming and renumbering of many streets. Re-naming and Re-numbering. 10 The following is a statement of the streets in respect of which orders have been received; the heading at the top of the first three columns giving the nature of the order, and the name in the last column showing the new name given in cases where the streets have been renamed: in all cases the orders have been fully carried out:— Streets Renumbered Only.

The North Metropolitan Tramway Co. have had to be served with a formal notice as to the state of the part of the road which they are called on by Act of Parliament to repair. Repairs of Roads by Public Companies. The Vestry directed the Medical Officer to view Norfolk House, Stepney Green, and see if same were not in a condition to be reported on under the Artizans, &c., Aft, 1868; but it was not found necessary to take such decided steps; and notices were served under the Nuisances Removal Acts, which were found sufficient to deal with the matter. The Vestry were compelled to deal with Nos. 65 to 77, Sidney Street, under the Artizans, &c., Act, but the works required will all be duly carried out. Artizans and Labourers'Dwell ings Act, 1868. The Vestry are pleased to be able to record that there have not been any serious floodings during the year; and now that the Metropolitan Board of Works are energetically pressing on the construction of the overflow sewer, the Vestry sincerely hope that this will be the last occasion when any reference to the subject will be requisite. Floodings. As intimated in the last Report, the Vestry felt constrained, as a matter of principle, to carry the case of Blackmore v. the Vestry to the Court of Appeal, and they are sorry to report that the Court decided against the Vestry's contention; and held that the Vestry owned the iron flap, not as Surveyors of Highways, but as the authority appointed to water the roads. As pointed out before, the Vestry feel that the decision will give rise to many fictitious claims, which it will be almost impossible to disprove. Several have already been made against the Vestry, but, on investigation, the Vestry determined to deny their liability in all, except one, which arose from negligence of a servant, and this the Vestry settled for a very small sum. Blackmore v. the Vestry The Vestry has, from time to time, had under its consideration the question of increased means of communication over the River Thames, east of London Bridge, and have by every means endeavoured to assist in procuring the required accommodation. The Board attended a large public meeting, held at the Mansion House, and have addressed two urgent representations to the Metropolitan Board of Works, on the necessity for that Board taking immediate steps in the matter. Communications over Thames East of London Bridge. The Vestry feel that the subject is now attracting far more real attention than it has ever done before and they hope that ere long the want will be at all events in part supplied. The Vestry has paid considerable attention to the sewers and drains and have eftedled some very important alterations. Sanitary Work. The sewer in Frederick's place has been repaired. The drain in Hawkins street has been altered. The sewer in Russell street has been taken up and relaid and the sewer between Devonshire street and Queen street has been altered at the joint expense of this Hamlet and Bethnal Green. A reference to the reports of the officers on this branch of the subject will show that there have been a great many other smaller but hardly less important matters dealt with. 12 Slaughter and Cow House Licenses. There were 19 applications for licenses for slaughter-houses, and 46 for cow-houses and each received the careful attention of the sanitary committee and the responsible officers before sanction by the Licensing Justices was given. Bakehouses, In consequence of circumstances coming to their knowledge, the Vestry took into consideration their position with regard to bakehouses, and found their jurisdiction was superseded by the Inspector appointed under the Factory & Workshops Act, 1878. The Vestry came to the conclusion that the Local Authority was in all circumstances the best able to deal with the matter, and accordingly addressed a communication to the Home Secretary, asking that he would in some way get the matter dealt with so as to restore to the Local Authorities the powers which they possessed under the Bakehouses Act, 1863. Obstruction in Streets. The Vestry have had to deal in several cases with obstructions in the streets. First and foremost has been the Waste, which has cost considerable amount of trouble and expense to keep clear. In the next place the coffee stall at the corner of St. Peters' Road, was much complained of by residents as causing the collection about midnight of a number of dissolute characters. The Vestry considered this was a case essentially under police jurisdiction, and accordingly brought the matter under the notice of the police authorities, who after much trouble got the matter properly dealt with. Placing goods on the pavement by shopkeepers has been the cause of much trouble, and the Vestry has had to serve several notices upon parties to cease the practice. If they do not do so nothing remains but for the Vestry to proceed strictly, and take the offenders before a police magistrate. Street paving. The two principal works which the Vestry have determined to do in the way of paving, are:— 1. The taking-up, redressing and relaying the stone in Jubilee Street, between the Mile End Road and Lady Lake's Grove. 2. Paving the east part of Devonshire Street. The Vestry have determined to borrow the money for the last-mentioned work, and spread the repayment over a period of 20 years. Whilst on this subject, the Vestry have to report that in consequence of the default of (Mr. Gabriel) the contractor, after due notice to deliver Kentish flints according to contract, the Vestry had to purchase the material elsewhere at an increased price. Treea in the Mile End Road The Vestry will charge the difference to the contractor. During the year application was received from the Metropolitan Garden Association, requesting permission to plant trees at the sides of Mile End Road. On enquiry, it appeared that the Association was willing to bear all the expence, and the Vestry being of opinion that if successful, the undertaking would add much to the comfort of passengers, and to the appearance of the road, granted the application on certain conditions which would enable the Vestry to act in case of things proving at any time a nuisance. 13 During the sitting of one of the Committees, a serious explosion of gas occurred in the neighbouring room from some unexplained cause. Happily no one sustained any injury, but if the escape had gone on but a very short time longer, no doubt a much more disastrous result would have taken place. The Vestry Hall and furniture, &c., being insured, the Insurance Company at once admitted the claim, and the places damaged were restored without cost to the Vestry. The subject of the Government of London was again mentioned in Her Majesty's Speech from the Throne on the opening of Parliament. It was felt that the matter would in all probability be brought forward during the session, and therefore in that the subject should receive due consideration—the Vestry resolved itself into a committee of the whole Board to be called together by the clerk whenever the Bill was introduced. This has not been done up to the present time. In order also that every opportunity might be afforded to all classes to express their opinions on the measure, the use of the Vestry Hall has been granted to the Churchwardens to hold a public meeting on the Bill, if, and when introduced. The Vestry will give the matter an impartial consideration. The work of completing a history of the works accomplished by the Vestry since 1855 has been completed, and the Vestry are clearly of opinion that a careful perusal of it will satisfy every reasonable mind that the prognostication of the results which would be shown by it which appeared in the Vestry's last report have been fully born out. The statement prepared by the Vestry's officers, are clear unvarnished statements of facts which can be tested if need be, and the Vestry are proud of what is set forth. The Vestry can only hope that if in the future, some other body supersedes them, that the new body will, after 25 years' service, be enabled to show as good a result. The Vestry felt that the work was worthy to be printed, and invited tenders for doing so, and Messrs. Penny & Hull's tender for £50 was accepted. As the printing and stationery contracts would expire at Lady Day, the Finance Committee considered the question, and recommended that the existing contracts should be extended for 12 months' if the contractors were willing. The Vestry adopted the recommendation of the Committee, and the contractors having been consulted, they determined to continue them. FINANCIAL. THE FINANCIAL QUESTIONS ARE NOW THE ONLY ONES REMAINING TO BE DEALT WITH. The expenses of the annual election of Vestrymen and Auditors in May 1882, was 5s. 6d, Gas Explosion. Municipality of London Bill. History of works accomplish ed by the Yestry. Printing and Stationery C ontracts Expenses of Annual Election of Vestrymen and Auditors. 14 The proportion of the expences of the triennial election of the members of the School Board for London, in November 1882, payable by this Hamlet, amounted to £116 6s. 11d. The poor-rate shows a further increase, being 2s. 7d. in the £ this year as against 2s. 6d. last year, and 2s. 4d. in the previous year. In dealing with these rates the Vestry must again draw attention to the fact that the School Board Rate has to be collected in the General Rate. The Vestry's calls in respect of several Rates have been For General, equal to 1s. 8d. in the £ Lighting os. 2¾d. ,, Sewers ,, os. 2d. ,, Making a total equal to2s. o¾d. ,, The School Board precept of £9,653 11s. 11d. represents a rate of 7½d. in the £, which being deducted from the above total of 2s. o¾d. in the £, leaves is. 5¼d. in the £, as enough to enable the Vestry to carry out all its own works. This is, as will be seen by reference to the following table, a considerable decrease on the rates of last year. The following is a statement showing the amounts in the £ required each year by the Vestry since 1875, in order to carry out its own work :— 1875 1s. 8d. in the £ 1876 1s. 8d.,, 1877 1s. 8d.,, 1878 1s. 8½d.,, 1879 1s. 8½d.,, 1880 1s. 9d.„ 1881 1s. 8d.„ 1882 1s. 7½d.,, 1883 1s. 5¼d.,, The precept of the School Board again exhibits an enormous increase, being no less than £1,372 16d. 11d. in excess of that of last year. As already explained, the School Board precept demands of itself a rate of 7½ d. in the £ to pay it. The usual statement of the School Board rates will be found appended thereto. Expenses of Triennial Election of School Board for London. Poor Rate General, Lighting and Sewers Rate. School Board precepts. 15 The precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works again shews a slight increase, but only of £41 45. 5d. Still, in order to raise the amount demanded, a Rate of a little over 6¾d. in the £ is required. It will thus be seen that the precepts to be raised for the School Board and Metropolitan Board require a rate of over 1s. 2¼d. in the £ to pay them. So long as the precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, of the School Board, and of the Asylums Board, continue to increase the Vestry cannot hold out any hope of a decrease of taxation. The Vestry keeps down its own expenditure as much as possible, but, at the same time, having regard to the fact that a false economy is, in the end, the dearest mode of proceeding. The Annual accounts have been duly audited, found correct and allowed, and are printed and published with this Report. The Reports of the various Officers will be found appended to this Report.

The cost of watering was a small amount less than last year, from the fact that 375,000 gallons of water less were required than in the previous year. The cost of dusting was considerably less than in the previous year, the time worked being nearly 800 days less than in 1882, and being very close to the time worked in 1881. This was in a great measure owing to the mild winter we have passed through. Since November last the Vestry have been sifting and disposing of the dust themselves. I have had no great difficulty in disposing of the ashes and breeze to the brickmakers, but have found that the quantity of manure made from a mixture of the soft core street sweepings and dung has not had a ready sale, although I have done my utmost in the way of advertising it in Essex, Cambridge, Norfolk and Suffolk, and have offered to put it on rail at 1/- per ton. The quantity of paper, rags and other insoluble rubbish spoils the sale of the material with farmers, and it is a fact that more ground stone comes off a road when wet than when dry, and I am of opinion that one load of good dry sweepings is worth three of the so-called mixture. I feel sure that if farmers would only try dry sweepings their value would be at once recognised, and it seems a sin to me to see so much valuable manure taken to shoots to fill up holes, when it ought to be converted into food. It would be good Political economy for the Vestry to give it away to any farmer, who would pay carriage, rather than they should see it thrown away. The hard core arising from dust sifting has not been so much trouble to dispose of as the soft core. Some have been sold, but large quantities have been put into trucks for the Great Eastern Railway Company, free of cost, for filling-up purposes. From November last to the present time, the amount produced by sale of refuse has been £418 11 4 The amount expended for wages 348 10 7 Leaving a profit on the 5 months' work of £70 0 9 The Vestry have had to construct a planked road into the station, which cost £96 4s. 0d. Owing to the formation of the Depot at Devonshire Street into a regular Goods Station, the site given to the Vestry has been continually changed, and this has not only caused the Vestry much loss but has been productive of delay and annoyance in the work. 61 The Vestry have not had the advantage of sending so much street refuse by rail as in previous years, and this entailed an outlay of ^48 over last year's expenditure. The long distance the road sweepings had to be carted to Stratford caused a considerable increase in the cost of carting, as will be seen by a comparison of the table. The cost of scavenging the roads may be said to be about stationary. The question of the disposal of street refuse must again before long be a source of great anxiety to the Vestry. The West Ham and Hackney Marshes appear to be the outlet most advantageous for this district, and so long as a place on which the refuse can be shot can be found, no course can be adopted which will be so cheap, but I can see troubles in this quarter approaching, and I am desirous of securing a place to last the coming winter. The time is not far distant when the parishes of London will have to consider some other means of disposing of their refuse. I am told that great success attends the use of "destructors" at Leeds, Manchester, and other places, but I have never seen these in operation and cannot give an opinion thereon. HORSE - KEEPING. During the year the Vestry's horses cost 6s. 3¾d. per day, as compared with 6s. 5fd. per day for the year 1882. The horses worked 8678 days for one horse, and cost £2737 17s. 2d., of which £404 14s. 7d. was for depreciation and interest of capital, and £2344 1s. 7d. for keep of horses and establishment charges, there being a credit of £10 1s. 9d. for dead horses. In accordance with instructions I allow depreciation on money expended in works at the rate of 5 per cent., and on the amount expended in horses and harness, &c., at the rate of 8 per cent.; this, in 1882, amounted to £383 2s. 7d., and in 1883 is increased by £21 12s., being in respect of £270, the price paid for 4 horses. The Vestry did, however, lose in 1882 4 horses, which cost £270, and in 1883 6 horses, which cost £390. In the face of these figures, I think the Vestry are not telling themselves the fact if the accounts continue to be made up, or the basis which their direction dictates. It must be clear to anyone that every horse the Vestry purchases, which costs £60, and is bought at seven years old, must live and work until he is 19½ years old, and then sell for £1 dead. The Vestry last year lost by death nearly one-fifth of their entire stud, or 20 per cent, exclusive of the depreciation on the remainder of the stock. My duty is clearly to make up the accounts in the way I am ordered, but I think after the experience we have now had it is also my duty to call your attention to the fallacy of so doing. 6 2 LIGHTING. The public lamps, 892 in number, have been supplied, lighted, painted and cleancd by the Commercial Gas Company, at a cost of £3559 17s. 4d- No complaint has been made during the year of the quality or pressure of the gas supplied. SEWERS. No important works have been executed during the year by the Vestry, but the storm outlet works have been progressing in the district by the Metropolitan Board's contractors, and although the work has been much inconvenience to the tradesmen in Cleveland Street, Mile End Road and High Street, yet this work when completed will be a lasting benefit to them and their successors. Twenty-five new gullies have been constructed, and 50 houses have been connected with the sewers belonging to the Vestry during the year. The cost of cleansing the principal sewers and gullies of the Hamlet was £601 8s. 0d. Seven-hundred and thirty-nine cubic yards of soil have been removed from the gullies, and 746 yards from the sewers of the Vestry. STEAM ROLLER. During the year the engine has worked 212 days for the Vestry, the cost of which would have been if hired £477 0 0 The Vestry have received for hire of the roller 293 0 0 £770 0 0 The total cost of wages and coke was £211 9 0 Repairs throughout 113 19 3 325 8 3 Result of the year's work £444 11 9 The Vestry have therefore had the whole of the macadamised streets of their district rolled, wherever repairs have been done, for the sum of £33.

EMBLEM, S. JENKINS, JAMES J. MUSTO, Auditors. B. DUCKHAM, J. MILLER, VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Cown. ANNUAL REPORT upon the PUBLIC HEALTH and SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1882—83, by MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: penny & hull, printers, 53- leman street, whitechapel. 1883. REPORT. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, In submitting the Twenty-seventh Annual Report upon the Public Health and Sanitary Condition of Mile End Old Town for the year 1882—3, I wish to explain that the reason for its somewhat late appearance has been the large amount of work devolving upon me personally as your Medical Officer of Health during the past year, and up to the present time, no doubt most members of the Vestry have foreseen this, but I have thought it better to make reference to it as the Reports of the Officers have to be sent to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The statistics are, in all respects, favourable. Table I. shows the total number of Marriages, Births, and Deaths, in Mile End during the year ending March last. BIRTHS. The number of births was 107 higher than for the previous year, and approached near double the number of deaths. The birth-rate was about 4 per 1000 population higher than that for the whole Metropolis, this will account in a large degree for the high rate of infantile mortality in this Hamlet, it is also evidence, I fear, of increased overcrowding, as it certainly is, of rapidly increasing population—the 1,952 excess of births over deaths represents the natural increase of population, to be subsequently diminished by early deaths. The female were 64 more than the male births. POPULATION AND ACREAGE. This high birth-rate fully justifies my estimate of the present popu lation of the Hamlet, 110,000, giving an average of 162 persons to an acre, compared with 51.6 to an acre in the whole Metropolis — included in the latter are the extensive parks, open spaces, and commons; to these, Mile End, in its Central East London position, has none remaining, the few squares and back gardens being all that are left in that 4 direction, and even large portions of these gardens are being covered with dwellings and other buildings, in defiance of all the Building and so-called Public Health and Sanitary Acts, passed ostensibly for the well-being of the public. No doubt many of the thickly-populated districts of the West and South of London contain a much larger population to acreage than ours with proportionately greater overcrowding. DEATHS. By the same Table it will be seen that the total deaths were 2,296, being 75 less than the previous year. The annual rate per 1,000 population was about the same as that for the whole Metropolis, including its most favoured districts. Table I. shows also the annual death-rate, 24-5 per 1000 population, of the six other Eastern districts combined, exclusive of Mile End, so that we not only compare favourably with the whole Metropolis, but especially so with the densely populated districts by which we are completely surrounded, a position and conditions which would, inferentially, act prejudicially upon the public health of this Hamlet, hence the low rate of mortality is all the more gratifying and satisfactory. The same Table further shows the total deaths were 59 less than the average for previous five years, although compared with a largely increased population. The Table also gives a comparison between the birth and death-rates in the Metropolis and Mile End—the death-rate, inclusive and exclusive of Workhouses and in Mile End, as compared with the other combined Eastern districts. Table IV. shows the number of deaths at various ages. As usual, the age under one year is largely in excess of the other periods, being about twenty-eight per cent, of the total mortality. During the first five years of age, the deaths amount to 47 per cent, of the total, then there is a rapid decline from five to twenty years, whence there is a gradual rise up to seventy years and upwards. There were two deaths at 88 and 89, and ten in the decade between 90 and 100, one being in the 100th year. The great majority of the infants, in the first year, die from inanition, mostly produced by specific or congenital diseases, bad feeding, and neglect. From that period up to five years they too easily fall victims to infectious diseases, or any illness by which they may be attacked. Table V. gives, in the first column, the monthly births for each quarter, and in the other twenty columns, the monthly deaths in each quarter, of males and females, separately, in each of the five Wards and Workhouses in the Hamlet, and the general totals. DEATHS IN WARDS. Table VI. shows the number of deaths in each Ward with rate per 1000 population, exclusive of Workhouses and Infirmary. The Centre and East are the highest, South and West much lower. The very low 5 rate in the South Ward is probably greatly attributable to its better class of houses, to the almost entire absence of narrow streets and courts, it wider streets throughout nearly its whole area, and less density of population and houses. It is more difficult to find or even suggest a reliable cause for the low rate in the West Ward; it contains, in the more western portion of its area, some of the oldest, most densely populated, dirty, and generally, unsanitary houses in the Hamlet, with many narrow streets and courts. Added to these presumably adverse conditions, there are many unsavory but necessary and useful industries carried on within its limits, and I must add, with the least possible annoyance or offence, in recent years, to the surrounding inhabitants, although, some years past, complaints were frequent. Table III. gives deaths from seven principal infectious diseases, exclusive of diarrhoea, which, in my opinion, in its ordinary endemic form, ought not to be included in this class of diseases, as is usually done by the Registrar-General and others, implying that it is produced by some specific poison or germ. This ordinary, or as it is often called, summer diarrhoea, is invariably caused by improper feeding, tainted food, or food which has been cooked in foul, or administered from, unclean and impure vessels. The fatal cases occur chiefly to very young and weakly children. The affection is easily produced, but may be, generally, as easily prevented. Scarlet-fever was the most fatal in this class, but seventeen less than in the previous year. Average for six previous years 67.3. The Table shows the death-rate with and without diarrhoea. Table VII. Upon reference to this Table, showing the deaths from infectious diseases during the year in the various streets, it will be seen that there were eighteen deaths only in this class, exclusive of diarrhoea in the West Ward, or an annual rate per 1000 population of 1.25 only, compared with 2.68 for the whole Hamlet. This is certainly exceptional. There was only one each in Plummer's Row and Thomas Street, three in Essex Street, two Baker Street, whilst Yalford Street, Robert's Place (Firmin Place), John's Place, and several others, are conspicuously absent from the list. Much good is, I am sure, attributable to the earnest work of the clergy and voluntary lay visitors, both local and from the West of London, who have a well-organized staff of paid efficient nurses acting under their control. This Ward is largely tenanted by foreigners, and the numerous common lodgings have the benefit of police supervision under the special Act. It may be useful to mention here that the Office of the East London Nursing Society is at No. 49, Philpot Street, where good nurses may be procured for private cases, upon application to the Lady Superintendent. The diseases included in this class demand the special attention of the Sanitary Authority, in order to adopt measures for their suppression and prevention. That such desirable results could be, at least practically, attained, is certain. There are great difficulties to overcome, the principal, perhaps, being the prejudice of relations and friends against the removal of patients from their overcrowded homes, where the sick 6 cannot be isolated from the healthy. This objection can only be overcome by sanitary teaching, and a great deal has been accomplished in that way in the Hamlet. Still the science of disease prevention and sanitation are less known and understood and much less practised in the present day than in very ancient times, even before the Christian era. Once the necessary machinery is organized, and an easily-worked system is perfected, all objections both to sanitation and removal of patients will rapidly disappear. SCHOOL BOARD SCHOOLS. Special vigilance on the part of visitors and other officials, in discovering and reporting upon infectious cases among the children attending the schools, or of illness in others at their houses, with a view to prevent such children coming to school so long as danger of infection existed, would prove of incalculable value in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. The School Board authorities have recently directed notice to be sent by their officials to the Medical Officer of Health of their District of any such cases coming under their observation. I believe there are twelve schools in the Hamlet under the control of the London Board, with an aggregate of upwards of 13,000 children on the rolls, affording the most fertile source and means for the diffusion of infections. When we contemplate the aggregate number of children in the whole of the Metropolitan Schools, penetrating as they must do into every street, court, and almost every house, the wonder is that these diseases are not even more prevalent and devastating than they have been hitherto; in any case, the indisputable fact remains that these public schools are the chief propagators of infectious diseases, and therefore proportionate care and supervision should be stringently exercised by those who are, or should be, responsible for the sanitary condition of the schools and health of the children. It is matter for surprise that the London School Board has not long initiated, in connexion with its great educational work, a hygienic and sanitary department, under efficient supervision; its cost would be speedily recouped, and would be the truest economy to the taxpayers as well as Name of Scliool.

This is a vexed and most delicate question upon which the Vestry will be called upon to express its views, in the almost certain event of future legislation upon the prevention of these diseases. It is proposed that either the friends of the patient or the occupiers of the house, or the medical attendant, shall be compelled to give immediate notice to the Sanitary Authority of the existence of infectious disease in any house. There would be great difficulties to contend with under all these heads: in the two first, there would be natural prejudice against publishing the fact to friends and neighbours, with probable injury to material and pecuniary interests; on the other hand, it would be said that those afflicted must submit, as in the case of a bodily accident, to their own loss and degree of liability. With regard to the private medical attendant, such a course would appear to invade that sanctity and confidence which exist between doctor and patient. Against these objections and individual injury by the compulsory plan, is to be opposed the good to the general public to be derived from the immediate warning of danger, so as to enable measures to be taken to prevent extension of fatal diseases and epidemics. It appears to me to be unjust to compel those who have no control over such visitations of disease, to make unknown sacrifices for the general good, without adequate compensation. It is upon this comprehensive principle that the question must be met, in place of the contracted and niggardly policy which has hitherto prevailed in questions of public health and life, some such measure must be enforced, combined with justice, for individual sacrifice. NEW BUILDINGS. During the year ending March, 1883, there were erected in the Hamlet New houses 70 Warehouses, sheds, and stable buildings 43 Block of model dwelling houses 1 During the same period seven houses were reported upon by me under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, and works accomplished under the recommendations of your Surveyor. Since January, 1879, fifty-nine houses have been reported upon, and proceedings adopted under the provisions of this Act, which has hitherto proved most successful in this District.

It will be observed that attention has been paid to the muchdiscussed subject of overcrowding. It is by no means easy to deal with this under the present state of the law, at all events, on such a scale as would alone be effectual in suppressing the evil. The subject is one that will no doubt shortly engage the serious attention of Parliament, and the numerous existing Acts being simplified, or rendered more workable, scope will be thereby afforded for the application of sound hygienic principles. Considering the low rate of mortality in the Hamlet, it is clear that as much has been effected in sanitary improvements as in any other equal area of the Metropolis. In conclusion, I desire to thank the Sanitary Committee and the Vestry for the consideration they have shown in respect of the various suggestions I have made and the recommendations contained in my numerous reports. And I am happy in this, the Eighteenth Annual Report, since I have discharged the duties of your Medical Officer, to present upon the whole a favourable account of the health of the Hamlet. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, MATTHEW CORNER, M.D. ADULTERATION OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT.
