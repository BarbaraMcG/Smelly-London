INTRODUCTION BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 2, SHALSTON VILLAS, SURBITON. June, 1958. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Annual Report 1957. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the Public Health and Social conditions of the Borough for 1957. The Report is on a similar pattern to that for previous years and prepared as indicated by Ministry of Health Circular 1/58. The year was one of steady progress and the health of the people was good. The vital statistics are favourable, maintaining the satisfactory trend of recent years, and upholding the fact that Surbiton is a good place in which to live ana work. Population: The home population as given by the RegistrarGeneral is 63,110, an increase of 500 on the figures for 1956. This compares with an increase of 40 in 1955 and continues the trend of recent years. It will be remembered that the constitution of the population is mainly of the Registrar-General's Classes I,II, and III, which are all Professional, Intermediate and Skilled occupations, there being more than twice the proportion of these classes in Surbiton than for the Country as a whole. The sex and age constitution of the population is such that the comparative figure is unity for births and 1.07 for deaths. Thus the sex and age constitution is not greatly different from that of the Country as a whole. Infectious Disease: The number of infectious disease notifications received in 1957 was 1160 compared with 686 for 1956. The increase is entirely due to an outbreak of measles. There were also 202 cases of dysentery, a decrease of 87 against the previous year. Freedom from diphtheria is again noted and is unquestionably due to the special attention to diphtheria immunisation. Vaccination afiainst Poliomyelitis. This valuable new protective procedure was carried out during the whole year at a pace determined by the supply of vaccine. Suitable arrangements were in hand to use the material to the best advantage as soon as it was received. It was given in rotation to those children who had registered applications for the vaccine with the Government's scheme. British vaccine was used throughout. 2. Births: The number of live births for 1957 is 777 and compares with 761 for 1956. The birth rate is 12.31 per 1,000 of the population. Deaths: The number of deaths recorded in 1957 is 553 compared with 615 for 1956. This gives a death rate of 8.76 per thousand of the population. The number of deaths of infants under one year in 1957 is 9 giving an Infant Mortality Rate of 11.58 compared with a Rate of 15.76 for 1956. This is an exceptionally low figure. Causes of Death: The main causes of death during 1957 were Heart 219 Cancer 117 Vascular lesions of Nervous System 82 National attention has been drawn in recent years to the general increase in the number of deaths attributable to lung cancer and its connexion with cigarette smoking. The following table shows the relevant figures for the past five years in respect of Surbiton residents. The Registrar-General couples cancer of the lung with cancer of the bronchus in his abbreviated list of causes of death. Deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 M F M F M F M F M F 18 4 19 5 21 2 24 6 19 4 Total Total Total Total Total 22 24 23 30 23 Health Services Handbook: During the year a Health Service Handbook was prepared giving information and data concerning health services available in the Borough. This was widely distributed to Doctors, Dentists, Chemists, Clinics and Council Departments to be made available to the public. Care of the Aged: The splendid work on behalf of the aged by voluntary bodies continued with increasing vigour throughout the year. It must be remembered by all who have responsibility in the community that the statutory bodies, i.e., the Surrey County Council and the Surbiton Borough Council depend on voluntary bodies to organise and carry out schemes for the welfare of the aged. and the necessary amplification of the official schemes and services. Therefore it is with satisfaction that we acknowledge the further provision made by the Surbiton Old People's Welfare Committee and the supporting organisations towards the new premises at "Alfriston", Berrylands Road. This work becomes more urgent with each succeeding year and is worthy of the utmost material and moral support from the Council and the people of the Borough. 3. Housing: The most striking development here is the change of character in the new houses which are going up in every corner where the smallest nlot can be used. TTow so-called maisonettes with small rooms and minimal accommodation are taking the place of normal sized rooms and family accommodation. The larger commodious houses of bygine age are being demolished and in the gardens 6-12 or more small blocks of maisonettes appearing. The new community will have to be absorbed and municipal services provided. This is a sign of a thriving community. Staff: Details of the staff and changes during the year are to be found on page 1. In conclusion I take pleasure in according thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support of the work of the Public Health Department, and to Mr. Eldridge, the Public Health Inspectors, Mr. Elms and the Staff of the Department for their hard work and loyal support throughout the year. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.W. STARKEY, Medical Officer of Health. 4. GENERAL STATISTICS.

Sickness benefit, contacts or carriers of infectious disease. Under the National Insurance Act, 1946, sickness benefit will, in certain circumstances, be payable to persons who are deemed to be incapable of work, though not actually so. It is only exceptionally that it is necessary to require a contact or carrier of infectious disease to stay away from work, and then only as regards the more serious infections. The Medical Officer of Health may issue a certificate in his responsibility for preventive action and may consider it necessary where there is special risk, that such a person should absent himself from his employment for a time; and it is in such circumstances that the right to draw sicKness benefit will arise. Benefit will only be paid on the strength of a certificate by a Medical Officer of Health that the person is under medical observation by reason of being a carrier of infectious disease, or has been in contact with a cise of infectious disease (as the case may be). in circumstances which make it advisable to exclude him from work. This Act applies particularly to food handlers, e.g. persons employed in cafes, canteens and restaurants. During the year 12 such Certificates were issued. POLIOMYELITIS. Six cases were reported during the year, as follows:- Case No. Sex Age Paralytic or Non-Paralytic 1 Male 5 years NP 2 „ 7 weeks P 3 Female 29 years P 4 Male 6 years P 5 Female 2 years P 6 Male 34 years P No poliomyelitis occurred in a vaccinated person; there was residual paralysis in five of the six cases but none died. INFLUENZA. In the early Autumn special watch was kept on the influenza situation in view of the probable introduction of the so-called “Asian” type which had its origin in the Par East in April and May. The Ministry of Health asked to be kept informed of the position, and Head Teachers of Schools and local General Practitioners were asked to collaborate in supplying information. A supply of vaccine was issued for doctors, nurses and public health workers who wished to avail themselves of it. A virus infection similar to the description of the Asiatic influenza did occur among school children. It commenced in the Hook and Chessington area, passing through Tolworth and Surbiton about the beginning of October, and finishing towards the end of the month. School attendances were down to approximately half in some cases, but in no instance was it necessary to close a school. 13. DIPHTHERIA. The Borough has now "been free from cases of diphtheria since 1946, and if parents will continue to take advantage of the immunisation service offered, there is no reason why the disease should not be entirely stamped out. The responsibility for providing this service rests with the County Council by virtue of section 26 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and the Medical Officer of Health, who is also the Divisional Medical Officer for the County Council, organises the service within the Borough. Clerical work on immunisation is conducted in the Public Health Department on behalf of the County Council for which 35% of a clerk's salary is reimbursed. Arrangements also exist with general medical practitioners to carry out diphtheria and whooping cough immunisation. A doctor taking part is expected to send records to the Authority of the immunisations carried out in the course of his general medical service; the Authority provides the record cards and pays a fee to the doctor for each completed record card received. Doctors are able to collect prophylactic material from the Public Health Department or from the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale. Diphtheria Immunisation Clinics are held at Gosbury Hill Clinic, 1, Gosbury Hill, Hook. Telephone: Elmbridge 5737 South Place Clinic, Ewell Road, Surbiton. Telephone: Elmbridge 4397 Friday mornings at 11 o'clock. Monday mornings at 11 o'clock. ( or Diphtheria immunisation may also be carried out by patient's own Doctor, as described above). DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION. The number of immunisations carried out during the year was as follows:- Age Group Primary Immunisations during 1957. Reinforcement doses during 1957. Age under 1 year + 490 - Age 1 year 88 - Age 2 years 23 - Age 3 years 15 - Age 4 years 10 91 Age 5-9 years 58 388 Age 10-14 years 7 920 + This figure includes children born in 1956 but still under 1 year when immunised in 1957. 14. The following table sets out the number of children immunised in each of the last five years:- Year Primary Immunisations Re-inforcements 1953 795 234 1954 746 284 1955 737 132 1956 741 298 1957 691 1,399 The number of immunisations carried out between 1st January, 1943 and 31st December, 1957, is shown below:- Under 1 1-4 1953-1956 5-9 1948-1952 10-14 1943-1947 Under 15 Total A. Number of children whose last course 166 (primary or booster) was completed in the period 1953-1957 2,486 2,106 1,325 6,083 B. Number of children whose last course (primary or booster) was completed in the period 1952 or earlier. - 2,008 2,818 4,826 C. Estimated mid-year child population 780 3,180 8,860 12,820 Immunity index 100 A/C 21.28 78.17 38.72 47.44 Note: The Immunity Index is the number of children immunised (primary or booster) during the last five years (total of item A.) expressed as a percentage of the total estimated mid-year child population (total of item C.) 15. SMALLPOX. Whilst this disease only appears in this country at rare intervals it is still prevalent in many parts of the world and its introduction here is an ever-present threat. Its seriousness is such that the simple precaution of vaccination ought not to be neglected even though it is no longer compulsory. Patients of all ages can be vaccinated by their own doctors, whilst children are also dealt with at the Clinics under the control of the Surrey County Council. Calf-lymph for vaccination is obtainable from the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colinuale. The number of persons who were vaccinated or re-vaccinated during 1957 was:- Age Groups Under 1 1 2-4 5-14 15 or over Total Vaccinations 547 57 28 43 102 777 Re-vaccinations - - 13 35 303 351 Calculations show that by the end of 1957 some 70% of children born between 1st July, 1956 and 30th June, 1957, have been vaccinated. This is a very satisfactory figure. SONNE DYSENTERY. The following table shows the number of cases occurring during the past eight years since first recognition of this disease in Surbiton:- 1950 140 1954 12 1951 62 1955 25 1952 Nil 1956 289 1953 10 1957 202 All but four of the 202 cases notified this year occurred in the early months and were a continuation of the 1956 outbreak. The total number of cases notified in England and Wales during 1956 was 48,982 and during 1957 was 28, 898. We feel it would be helpful to repeat some of the information written in last year's Annual Report. Personal hygiene is of the utmost importance in prevention especially the washing of hands after use of water-closet and before eating. W.Cs.should be kept scrupulously clean, seats, chain-pulls and door handles in particular being frequently washed. Schools are naturally associated with the dissemination of the illness, but without doubt it also spreads rapidly through households once introduced. It is therefore regarded as a "family" illness necessitating checking of all contacts. This 16. is readily done in the laboratory by examination of faeces, but the task of controlling an outbreak is a major operation calling for close co-operation between laboratory, medical practitioners, teachers, parents and Public Health Department staff. The high local notification rate is no doubt due in large measure to the diligence with which cases are searched for and contacts checked. No person who has been a confirmed case (child or adult) is regarded as reasonably free from liability to spread infection until three consecutive negative specimens have been forthcoming. There is much evidence of reversion after two negatives and even of this occurring more than once with the same patient. Sonne Dysentery is a highly infectious disease which can be fatal in very young children, and because of the rapidity with which it spreads it is necessary to move very quickly in applying control measures when a case occurs if a large outbreak is to be prevented. The greatest chance of success comes when no time is lost in recognising the condition and notifying it to the Public Health Department. FOOD POISONING. There were no outbreaks of food poisoning and no deaths from this cause. \ In nine sporadic cases of suspected:-food poisoning noyified by general medical practitioners the causative organisms were identified as shown below:- Staph. Aureus 5 cases S. Typhi-murium 3 cases S. Derby 1 case This is four less than last year. While the decrease is Welcomed, the object of our efforts in food hygiene, standards of cleanliness in the preparation, cooking, and serving of food is aimed at eliminating this risk altogether. The case of S. Derby was a man who was undoubtedly infected during a business trip to Central America. Two of the S. Typhi-murium cases were father and son aged 3 years who became ill during a summer holiday on the East coast. The third was a child of and the origin of his illness was not traced. One of the Staph.Aureus cases was a man whose illness necessitated removal to hospital and was probably due to eating ham purchased in another district where other cases were traced with the same origin. Another case was a woman in business outside the Borough and the source of her illness could not be traced. Two other Staph.Aureus cases were mother and daughter and again the origin of the illness was not definitely proved. Suspicion rested upon salt beef from which a food poisoning type Staph. Aureus was isolated, but phage typing of a specimen from one of the patients revealed another type not usually associated with food poisoning. The fifth case was a six months old child who was most likely infected at home. 17. LABORATORY FACILITIES. Extensive use is made of the facilities provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service (directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health); an opportunity is taken to gratefully acknowledge the co-operation of Doctor D.M. Stone and her staff at the Epsom Laboratory to which our specimens are taken. Apart from samples of water, milk, ice-cream and other food (details of which are given under other headings) the undermentioned specimens were collected by the Inspectors in the course of investigating cases of dysentery, typhoid, food poisoning, etc. and taken to the Laboratory Year Faeces Suspected Food 1950 1,202 13 1951 694 2 1952 183 15 1953 129 12 1954 263 8 1955 306 10 1956 3,704 6 1957 2,256 24 EXCLUSION FROM SCHOOL Five hundred and thirty-two certificates were issued excluding and re-admitting school cases and contacts of infectious diseases. 18.

It was not necessary to take any action under these regulations during the year. Public Health Act, 1936, Section 172. No action was taken under this Section. 20. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. During the year 77 persons were medically examined for the Council in connection with staff entering the Superannuation Fund or Sick Pay Scheme, or about to go on pension, as follows:- Superannuation Fund Sick Pay Scheme Special Examination 31 43 3 WELFARE OF OLD. PEOPLE. There is in the Borough much voluntary activity devoted to this cause. Seven Clubs meet weekly in various parts of the district and there is another which opens daily. A chiropody service for which there is very great demand has been organised and five sessions per week are held. Seaside holidays for parties of elderly people are arranged annually, and there is a distribution of dinners to the housebound at Christmas. Home visiting is carried out so far as the availability of visitors permits, and there is close co-operation with official bodies. All this work is co-ordinated through the Surbiton Old People's Welfare Committee, a voluntary body representative of most walks of life in the Borough and presided over by His Worship the Mayor. The Committee hopes to expand its activities at an early date following successful negotiations with the Borough Council for the leasing of a large house which will be an Old People's Centre including club, recreation rooms, chiropody clinic, canteen, office, etc. The Council makes a generous contribution towards the cost of the Meals on 'heels service which is operated by the Surbiton Division of the British Red Cross Society. The number of subsidised mid-day meals distributed during the year was 4,010. The Council has provided twenty-eight special flatlets for aged people, and a further sixty such dwellings are shortly to be erected. WATER SUPPLY. The whole of the water supply for the Borough comes from the Metropolitan Water Board and is satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. All premises have a direct mains supply and there are no wells in use. Monthly reports are supplied by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. Eleven bacteriological samples were taken by the Department for special reasons and all were satisfactory. 21. RIVERS AND STREAMS, The opening of the new sewage disposal works belonging to the Hogsmill Valley Joint Sewage Board to which sewage from Epsom is taken "by trunk sewer should result in a considerable improvement in the state of the water of the Hogsmill River which forms the Borough boundary for some two miles on the eastern side. SWIMMING BATHS. Publicly owned bath. Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide, with a depth of three to nine feet. There is also a paddling pool for small children. The water is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by breakpoint chlorination and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and the plant adjusted as necessary. In addition twelve samples were taken by the Public Health Department for chemical and bacteriological examination all of which proved to be satisfactory. School bath. One private school has a small swimming bath which is used only by scholars and staff. Sterilisation is by hand dosing with chlorine coupled with frequent changes of water. Seven samples were taken by the Department to ensure adequate chlorination. REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. Refuse and salvage collection is under the control of the Borough Engineer. The rate of collection was maintained at seven day intervals except when interfered with by holidays and sickness. The refuse is transported to a central loading depot in the Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames, transferred to large haulage wagons and then moved by contract for disposal into privately owned water-filled gravel pits. FACTORIES ACTS, 1957 and 1948. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 260 ( 223 mechanical, 29 non-mechanical,and 8 works of building construction).

This Act and its accompanying regulations came into operation on 6th July, 1957, and brought a new burden, both technical and clerical, to the Department. The Council decided to delegate to the Public Health Committee its powers relating to Certificates of Disrepair, and this materially helped in dealing with applications in the expeditious manner which is so important in common fairness to the parties concerned. The position up to the end of the year is shown in the following summary (1) No. of applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I.) 61 (2) No. of decisions not to issue certificates 3 (3) No. of decisions to issue certificates- (a) in respect of some but not all defects listed by tenants. 40 (b) in respect of all defects listed 12 (4) No. of undertakings to remedy defects given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule (Form K.) 27 (5) No. of such undertakings refused by Council Nil (6) No. of notices of proposal to issue a Certificate of Disrepair served (Form J.) 52 (7) No. of Certificates of Disrepair issued 10 (8) No. of applications by tenants under consideration at the end of year. 6 32. FOOD INSPECTION Foodstuffs of all descriptions are constantly under inspection to see that they are fit for human consumption. During the year a variety of foods which were not so fit were surrendered by the owners and either salvaged for animal feeding or destroyed by burning. The total weight of such goods was:- 12 cwts: 3 qrs: 16 l6s: 13- ozs; There is no slaughterhouse in use in the Borough, consequently no meat inspection is carried out except in butchers' shops. Fifty-five samples of various kinds of food were taken for bacteriological examination as a routine measure to check on fitness for food. FOOD HYGIENE. Forty-three premises are registered under section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or ,rotted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale, and ten premises for the preparation of preserved food intended for sale for human consumption (being the preparation of fish by any Process of cooking). One thousand and sixty visits were made to these premises and to shops, canteens, restaurants, public houses, food handling businesses, and vehicles to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food intended for sale. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act, byelaws and other legislation:- Hot water supply Provided for washing 21 Protection of food from contamination 4 Windows repaired or renewed 3 Floors repaired or renewed 11 Food rooms cleansed 40 Rooms ventilated 1 W.C.s cleansed or repaired 8 W.C.s additional provided 1 Drains cleansed, repaired or renewed 7 Additional drains provided 1 W.C.s lighted or ventilated 6 Accumulations removed 1 Dust receptacles provided 3 Refuse storage improved 2 Sinks and basins provided 15 Waste pipes repaired 5 Walls treated with damp resisting material 1 Internal walls and ceilings repaired 5 Mobile vans provided with washing facilities 1 Miscellaneous 15 In general the standard of food hygiene throughout the Borough has been maintained at a satisfactory level, though it is a subject which requires constant attention by the Inspectors. Street trading and delivery of unwrapped foods from vans still leave something to be desired, and it is felt that more could be done by the public to discourage the sale of "open" foods in ways which whilst not strictly offending against the letter of the law are in fact frustrating the efforts which are beinq made to achieve the clean handling of food at all stages before it reaches the customer. 34. .

FOOD & DRUGS (cont.) The Analyst's report and details of action taken on contravening samples were as follows:- 1828 (informal) Sausage - beef. Consisted of preserved beef sausages containing 250 p.p.m. by weight of sulphur dioxide. Manufacturer (a local butcher) did not use preservative but had failed to notice that the spices he was using did contain S02. Suitable notice subsequently exhibited in shop. 1849 (informal) Steak and kidney pie. No recognisable kidney was detected. Manufacturer (a small local trader) stated kidney used for flavouring only. In future to be described as "Steak pies". 1863 (informal) Soup, cream of chicken. The sample contained 2.6% of total fat and 0.3% of butterfat, whereas a product sold as cream soup which contains less than 1½% of butterfat should have a total fat content of not less than 3½%. Manufacturers stated that this tin was five years old and they were quite unable to account for the deficiency. They withdrew from sale any of that batch of soup which was traceable. A sample of their current production was found to be satisfactory. 1864 (informal) Cake mix. 1868 (informal) Cake mix. These articles contained the ingredients for making the basic cake but not for the icing and filling although the front panels of the cartons bore illustrations of cakes complete with icing and filling. 1864 - Manufacturers decided to discontinue this line. 1868 - Matter taken up with manufacturers who agreed that all offending illustrations will be omitted from their advertising matter, and on the next replacement of stocks of cartons a new design and printing will be adopted. 1869 (informal) Cake mix. This article contained the ingredients for making the basic cake and for the icing, but an additional ingredient, namely margarine, is required for making the filling. The carton in which this article was sold included on the front panel an illustration of a cake complete with icing and filling, but there was no indication on this panel that an additional ingredient was required for making the complete cake as illustrated. Correspondence with manufacturers. No decision reached. 37. FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.) 1918 (informal) Frankfurter sausages. The ingredients of these pre-packed sausages were not specified on the label as is required by the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. Negotiations took place with manufacturers re labelling. The views of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were obtained, and it was decided that the Manufacturers be asked to specify the ingredients on the label of this commodity. 1902 (informal) Mixed fruit. The fruit was gritty to the taste and contained 0.09% of sand and earthy matter (removable by washing). The fruit was described on the label as Dry cleaned and blended by machinery, but dry cleaning does not remove fine sand and earthy matter. The fruit was not suitable for use without prior washing. Negotiations with packers and suggestion mode that necessity for washing before use should be displayed more conspicuously on cartons. The views of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were obtained and considered with comments thereon by the Public Analyst., It was decided that the Ministry be informed that it is considered that the word ''Cleaned" on the outside of the carton of this commodity should be omitted. 1954 (informal) Chopped pork. Contained only 87% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 95%. 1920 (informal) Chopped pork with beef and ham. Contained only 75% of total meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 3%. 1950 (informal) Luncheon meat. Contained only 63% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 80%. 1962 (informal) Luncheon meat. Contained only 67% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 80%. 1919 (informal) Luncheon meat, pork. Contained only 65% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 90%. 1945 (informal) Luncheon meat, pork. Contained only 73% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 30%. Representations made to Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food urging them to prescribe standards for this class of goods 38. FOOD & DRUGS ACT (Cont.) 1948 (informal) Luncheon meat, pork. Contained only 75% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 90%. 194-9 (informal) Luncheon meat, pork. Contained only 77% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 90%. 1951 (informal) Luncheon meat, pork. Contained only 72% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 90%. 1953 (informal) Luncheon meat, pork. Contained only 62% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 90%. 1955 (informal) Luncheon meat, pork. Contained only 73% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 90%. 1956 (informal) Luncheon meat, pork. Contained only 82% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 90%. 1957 (informal) Luncheon meat, pork. Contained only 72% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 90%. 1958 (informal) Luncheon meat, pork. Contained only 76% of meat instead of a reasonable minimum of 90%. Representations made to Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food urging them to prescribe standards for this class of goods. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955. Foreign bodies in food. During the year a number of complaints about food containing foreign substances were received in the Department and dealt with as under:- (i) Foreign Matter in Bread - A resident complained about a greenish contaminating substance found in an unwrapped loaf of bread delivered to her house. The Public Analyst's report on this sample and the manufacturer's observations were considered by the Council and it was decided that a warning letter be sent to the manufacturers concerned. (ii) Foreign matter in Bread - A resident complained about three small pieces of fine wire found in a wrapped and sliced loaf of bread. After a careful investigation the Council decided that no action be taken. 39. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 (Cont.) Foreign bodies in food (iii) Foreign Matter in Vanilla Slice - A purchaser complained about a splinter of wood which had been found in a vanilla slice. The manufacturers had obtained a laboratory report which was submitted to the Council, and after due consideration it was decided that a warning letter be sent to the manufacturers. (iv) Foreign Matter in Bread - A purchaser complained about a piece of string embedded in part of an unwrapped white loaf of bread. The manufacturers had obtained a laboratory report which was submitted to the Council who decided that in this case a strong warning letter be sent to the manufacturers. (v) Foreign Matter in Meat Pasty - A local resident complained about an insect found in a meat pasty. The Council decided that a warning letter be sent to the trader. (vi) Mould in Meat Pie - A purchaser complained about a small mould growth on the surface of meat in a steak and kidney pie. The Council decided that in this case a warning letter be issued to the retailer. (vii) Foreign Matter in Drinking Chocolate - A purchaser complained about block particles, cobwebs and maggots found in a tin of drinking chocolate. The maggots were confirmed as grubs of the Ephestia moth. The question of a more effective method of sealing the tins of this commodity was taken up with the manufacturers who stated they were in course of substituting a lever lid tin. MILK SUPPLY (i) At the end of the year there were thirty-eight entries on the register as follows:- Distributors of milk with premises in the Borough 21 Distributors of milk with premises outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 8 (ii) Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949-1954. Milk (Special Designation) (pasteurised end Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949-1953. Dealers' licences to sell designated milk were granted as follows:- Pasteurised milk 19 " " (supplementary) 9 Tuberculin Tested milk 17 " " (supplementary) 8 Sterilised milk 17 " " (supplementary) 9 40. MILK SUPPLY (Cont.) (iii) Ninety-four samples of milk were token during the year and submitted to the following tests;- Turbidity Test T.B.Biological Test Methylene Blue Test Phosphatase Test Pasteurised – – 50 50 T.T. Pasteurised – – 17 17 i Sterilised 5 – – – T.T. Raw Milk – 12 – – Tuberculin Tested – – 3 – T.T. (C.I. Farm Bottled) - 1 – – Raw Milk (ungraded) – 6 – – The phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been properly carried out; the methylene blue test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality; the turbidity test is a check on sterilisation and the T.B. test is for the purpose of detecting tubercle bacilli. All samples conformed to the required standard. Proceedings were taken against a Distributor under Section 26 (1) of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, for failing to ensure that a vessel (bottle) used for containing milk was in a state of thorough cleanliness. A fine of £50 was imposed and the Council awarded £5. 5. Od. costs. This was the fourth conviction for a similar offence. ICE CREAM Premises have been registered by the Corporation under Section 16, Food and Drugs Act, 1955, under:- For manufacture, storage and sale 8 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to be limited to iced lollies 13 For storage and sale but not manufacture 142 During the year 17 applications for registration were received (including 11 changes of occupier) and approved. 41. ICE CREAM (Cont.) 79 samples were taken, details being as follows:Ice Cream. Grade 1. 67 90.6% Grade 2. 5 6.85% 97.4% Grade 3. 1 l.3% Grade 4. 1 1.3% 2.6% 74 Iced Lollies Grade 1. 5 100% 79 The public Health Laboratory Service advises that owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results on any single sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that over a six monthly period, 50%, of a vendor's samples should fall into Grade 1, 80, into Grades 1 or 2, not more than 20% into Grade 3, and none into Grade 4. The results above show a slight improvement on those of last year and indicate that the satisfactory standard referred to in the last three reports is being maintained. There are no manufacturers of ice cream within the Borough but a few retailers produce their own iced lollies. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. Thirty-seven licences to station and use moveable dwellings (caravans) were granted during the year. Twenty-four of the caravans are standing on the Riverhill Estate which has been leased to a local Sports Club. The remainder are stationed on odd sites throughout the Borough. The unlicensed site referred to in previous reports was comulsorily acquired by the Council during the year for housing purposes and steps were being taken to remove the caravans. DUSTBINS Twenty-four dustbins were provided as a result of 5 statutory and 19 informal notices served. The ambiguity of the Public Health Act which provides that the local authority may require either the owner or occupier of any building to provide a dustbin still gives rise to difficulties necessitating a judicial decision by the Council in all disputed coses. None of the five cases so decided by the Council was the subject of appeal to the Magistrates. During the year the Council's scheme for the sale of new dustbins was discontinued. 42 . DISINFECTION (a) During the year disinfection was carried out at thirty-nine premises in which the following diseases occurred Poliomyelitis (or suspected) 13 Tuberculosis 5 Scarlet fever 7 Meningococcal infection 2 Para-Typhoid B. 1 Encephalitis (suspected) 1 Miscellaneous 10 Disinfection was also carried out at twenty-nine premises on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. (b) The total number of articles disinfected by steam at the Tolworth Hospital, or destroyed was:- Disinfected. Destroyed. Blankets 19 — Bolsters 7 - Mattresses 22 6 Mattress covers 4 - Pi Hows 56 - Pillow cases 11 — Sheets 6 — Y/earing apparel 48 - Counterpanes 5 - Miscellaneous 10 — 188 6 (c) No. of rooms disinfected... 71 No. of library books disinfected 83 DISINFESTATION. (a) Bed Burs. Council Houses Other Houses Pound to be infested. Disinfested Pound to be infested Disinfested - 6 6 Method employed for disinfestation:- Spraying with insecticides 6 43. DISINFESTATION (Cont.) (b) School Canteens. At the request of the County Council twelve school canteens were sprayed with insecticide to prevent flies and other insect pests the County Council paying the cost of the work. (c) General (i) Advice is frequently sought from the Department in the identification and measures for eradication of insect pests of various kinds. For the convenience of the public a small stock of insecticides and sprayers is held in the Department, and these articles are sold at cost price when required. This service seems to be very much appreciated. (ii) During the year an application was received from two local residents for cleansing from Pediculosis Pubis. Section 85, Public Health Act, 1936, authorises a local authority to take such measures as are necessary to free such persons and their clothing from vermin without charge. As no suitable facilities are available for the purpose locally arrangements were made with the Royal Borough of Kensington for the two persons to be dealt with at their cleansing station, the cost being met by this Council. PUBLIC MORTUARY During the year 68 bodies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination, and one body awaiting burial. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. It was not necessary to make any burial arrangements as provided by Section 50 of the Act. It was not necessary to make use of the powers of Section 47 for compulsory removal to suitable premises of sick or aged persons in need of care and attention. SHOPS ACT, 1950. One hundred and one visits were made in the administration of this Act, and seven infringements corrected. "Shop" for the purposes of this Act is a very comprehensive term and includes any premises where any retail trade or business is carried on. The number of such premises in the Borough at the end of 1957 was:- Antique dealers and secondhand furniture 11 Bakers 18 Boots and shoes 33 Builders and Decorators Supplies 22 Butchers 39 Cafes and Restaurants 39 Chemists 23 Confectioners, newsagents and tobacconists 92 Cycles, radio and television 21 Dairies 8 Drapers and Ladies' Outfitters 51 Electrical supplies 10 44 Carried forward: 367 SHOPS ACT. 1950 (Cont.) Brought forward 367 Fishmongers and Pried Pish Shops 16 General Stores 12 Greengrocers, Fruiterers and Florists 49 Grocers and Provision Merchants 78 Hairdressers 43 Hardware, Ironmongery and Timber 21 Licensed premises 50 Motor and Cycle Dealers and Engineers 26 Tailors and Outfitters 18 Upholsterers end House Furnishers 12 Watchmakers and Jewellers 7 Miscellaneous 64 763 THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. This Act which prohibits the sale or letting of certain heating appliances without an effective fireguard, together with Regulations made by the Secretary of State, became operative during 1954. Twelve visits were made to premises in the Borough and one warning given where such an appliance was not satisfactory. The offending appliance was withdrawn from sale. PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951 This Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals". Six premises were licensed during the year. Nineteen inspection were made but no infringements of the licence conditions found. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food continued its grant-aid of 50 per cent of the irrecoverable expenditure incurred by the Council in carrying out its functions under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. The Act places upon the occupiers or, in certain circumstances the owners, of land (including buildings) the responsibility for the destruction of rots and mice thereon and for keeping the land free from such pests. It is the duty of the Council to carry out inspections to see that this is done, and to secure so far as practicable that their district is kept free from rots and mice. Where necessary they may serve upon owners or occupiers notices requiring them to take steps for this purpose and penalties are laid down for failure to comply with such notices. 45. RATS AND LICE DESTRUCTION (Cont.) The policy of the Council is, however, to give such assistance as is possible to the occupiers of private dwelling houses. For that purpose they permit their own small rodent control staff, who are primarily engaged to deal with Corporation property (including sewers) to give advice and practical help where appropriate, without charge, subject to the signing of the "Request for Treatment" form. The Council is under no legal obligation to do this and does not undertake to provide a service for the destruction of vermin, but does allow its staff to help so far as time permits. Many requests are received and are responded to as quickly as possible, and in the order received as far as practicable, but at times it is as long as a week before complaints can be dealt with. Every effort is made to give householders the best possible service with the staff available. Grant-aid is not available in respect of expenditure incurred on treatment at commercial and industrial properties and the full cost of the work has therefore to be recovered from the occupiers of such premises or, in certain circumstances, the owners. Fifty-one business or industrial premises, school, etc. were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year. It seems that the rodent population is being kept down to as low a level as is likely to be achieved until new techniques are evolved and perhaps new poisons introduced. During May the 14th maintenance treatment of the Corporation's sewer system was carried out, in September the ninth annual test baiting of the sewer system was completed and this was followed up with the 15th maintenance treatment in November.

At the same time a trial was made in another area in the direct poisoning method using Warfarin. In both cases results were considered to be very satisfactory. 48.
