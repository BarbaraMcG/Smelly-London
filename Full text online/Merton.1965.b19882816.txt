Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the first Annual Report on the health of the London Borough for 1965. The Report shows that the health of the residents has been good during the year and, generally, vital statistics compare favourably with those of the country as a whole. The Registrar-General's estimated mid-1965 home population of 185,130 shows a decrease of 910 compared with the population in 1964. The live births totalled 2,899 giving a live birth rate per 1,000 of the population of 15.66. Of these 2,899 live births, 228 were illegitimate. The live birth rate for England and Wales for the year was 18.1. Deaths from all causes numbered 2,106 giving a death rate per 1,000 of the population of 11.37. The excess of births over deaths was 793. The reduced population followed a trend which has persisted over the past ten years. The population of the area in 1955 was 195,970. It will thus be seen that the population of the area has fallen, since 1955, by 10,840, although in each of the intervening years there has been an excess of live births over deaths. Throughout the years since 1955 the live birth rate of the area has been considerably lower than the national rate, and whilst in 1955 the death rate of the area was 9.1 compared with the national rate of 11.7 for England and Wales, over the intervening years the disparity between the local and the national death rates has narrowedâ€”for 1965 Merton's death rate is 11.37 and that for England and Wales is 11.5. There would appear to be no indication that this tendency to a shrinking population may be altered in the near future. In the summary of the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of Health and Welfare Services of Local Authorities in England and Wales, the Ministry of Health shows the projected population of the Borough as 173,600 by 1976, giving a further anticipated reduction of population of 11,530 during the next 11 years. There was only one case of poliomyelitis during the year. This was a case which produced partial paralysis of the upper arm and shoulder of the patient, which was diagnosed in retrospect some weeks after the onset of the initial symptoms. One case of typhoid fever occurred during the year. This occurred in a child returning from a Continental holiday with her parents. During the incubation period of the disease, the child was attending a private nursery. An investigation was carried out on the staff and pupils at this nursery. All the specimens of stools taken proved to be negative. The child made a satisfactory recovery. There was a high incidence of measles, which is a normal epidemological feature every two years. The demand on the Home Help Service throughout the year was heavy, and the difficulty of recruiting sufficient Home Helps to meet all demands to the full, in an area in which women were able to find many alternative forms of employment, made the task of allocation of help a matter of careful selection of priorities of need. 6 In the operation of the Mental Health Service, the need for establishing a close liaison with mental hospitals to which patients from this area are regularly admitted, became a matter of priority. By the end of the year a close link had been established, both by the medical staff and by the Mental Welfare Officers of the Department. The Authority's Mental Welfare Officers took the initiative in requesting case conferences with hospital staff on patients with specially complex difficulties. Some difficulty was experienced in ascertaining whether patients being discharged from hospital were in need of, or desirous of having, community care even when such patients had been receiving such care before their admission to hospital. The practical difficulties of maintaining a close link with mental hospitals in the area are very real ones. Patients from this Borough are admitted to three mental hospitals, namely Netherne, West Park and Horton Hospitals and if, in accordance with the highest standards of social work practice, a close liaison is to be maintained with patients, whilst in hospital or in the community, close links with three mental hospitals are obviously much more difficult and time consuming with a limited staff, than would be the case if a close link had merely to be established with one hospital serving the area. In addition it is also necessary to maintain some liaison with three hospitals for subnormal patients. Throughout the year, difficulties associated with staffing were an ever-present problem. The establishment framed to meet the needs of the Health Department, comprises a variety of professional and semi-professional workers, and the twofold problem was that of recruiting staff with appropriate professional qualifications and the necessary experience, and of retaining such staff once recruited. In the case of Social Workers it became apparent that the acute shortage was to be a continuing one, especially when one realises that on the establishment of the Health Department there is provision for Medical Social Workers, Psychiatric Social Workers, Mental Welfare Officers and other Social Workers whose period of training leading to eventual qualification varies from two to four years. The choice, therefore, in filling vacancies for Social Workers on the establishment was seldom one of selecting the best applicant from a short list of qualified and experienced candidates but was rather a matter of appointing from the available applicants, one who, although professionally unqualified, had previous practical experience in this field of work, and whose personality was suitable. It was not possible, therefore, to fill all the vacancies on the establishment with qualified staff, and it is obvious that the best hope for the future is for the Authority to train, on an assisted training scheme, persons with the necessary educational background and personality, to embark on training leading to an eventual professional qualification. In the meantime, unqualified staff on the establishment receive guidance and help from the qualified staff. By the end of the year it had not been possible to recruit a Deputy Superintendent of the Midwifery and Home Nursing Service, and the Superintendent, therefore, carried on under considerable difficulties. The inability to appoint a Health Education Officer is very much to be regretted. This is an essential post in a Health Department for, 7 without such an Officer, health education tends to become sectionalised rather than being carried out as a cohesive and carefully formulated plan, placing due emphasis at appropriate times, on various aspects of positive health. As a means of maintaining a close liaison with other branches of the National Health Service and with other London Boroughs, during the year it is necessary for me to attend meetings of St. Helier Group Medical Committee, The Association of London Borough Medical Officers of Health, London Liaison Committee, South West London and Surrey Executive Council, South West London and Surrey Local Medical Committee, Regional Liaison Committee of the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, and St. Helier Group Maternity Liaison Committee (of which I am the Chairman). A period of reorganisation of such great significance as the London one is bound, in the early stages of its implementation, to present difficult problems of administration, not the least of which has been the change, in the sphere of the Personal Health Services from a system of Divisional Administration formulated by the Surrey County Council, and carried out by the three former County Districts under the guidance of County Council Central Administration, to a system of administration as a directly responsible Local Health Authority. The first year of the new set-up, therefore, has been to some extent a period of transition in which the staff of the Health Department, particularly those in senior administrative posts, have slowly conditioned themselves to the greater responsibilities associated with the assumption by the Authority of direct responsibility, as opposed to responsibility under the umbrella of a County Central Administration. This was inevitable since, with few exceptions, the Health Department staff comprised personnel who had worked in the previous Divisional system. On the Environmental Health side, of course, this was a merging of the Services of three Authorities into one, the change from Divisional to Central Administration not being an attendant problem, although the merging of the policies of three former Districts, particularly under the Clean Air Act, into one procedure for the new Borough presented very real problems. In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for the consideration and courtesy they have shown to me during the year. My thanks are also due to all members of the Health Department for the loyal and efficient manner in which they carried out their duties during a difficult period of reorganisation. I would especially like to thank Mr. Cockell, the Chief Public Health Inspector and Mr. Atkinson, my Chief Administrative Officer, for their contributions in connection with the preparation of this Report. I am also indebted to my colleagues in other Departments for their ready help and co-operation on all occasions. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, P. J. DOODY, Medical Officer of Health. 8 COMMITTEES AT 31st DECEMBER, 1965 HEALTH COMMITTEE The Mayor, Alderman Cyril S. Marsh, J.P. Councillor (Miss) N. K. Watts (Chairman) Councillor G.

The only one of these which was delivered at home died within 30 minutes, the cause being multiple congenital abnormalities. The infant mortality rate of 18.35 and the neonatal mortality rate of 10.69 per 1,000 live births compare satisfactorily with the respective rates of 19.0 and 13.0 for England and Wales. PERINATAL MORTALITY The perinatal mortality rate for Merton was 21.83 per 1,000 live and still-births thus comparing favourably with that for England and Wales of 26.9. MATERNAL MORTALITY Two maternal deaths were attributed to the Authority for 1965. One was a death in hospital in March, the cause of death being antepartum haemorrhage following breech delivery of a full-term infant. The second death actually occurred in November, 1964, but since the cause of death, given as air embolism due to instrumental abortion, was certified by the Coroner following his enquiry in 1965, this death was attributable to 1965, thus producing an unfortunately high maternal mortality rate of 0.68 per 1,000 live and still-births. 19 CONTROL OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES Notifications received during 1965 (Corrected Notifications) Disease Age Groups of Cases Notified Total Under 1 1- 2 34 59 1014 15- 24 2544 4564 65 & over Measles 81 578 737 934 64 18 16 - - 2428 Scarlet Fever 1 3 16 36 6 â€” â€” â€” â€” 62 Pneumonia â€” â€” 1 â€” â€” 3 1 6 â€” 11 Puerperal Pyrexia â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” 8 7 â€” â€” 15 Whooping Cough 4 8 9 20 1 â€” â€” â€” â€” 42 Dysentery 2 4 9 7 1 4 4 3 â€” 34 Tuberculosis (Resp.): Males â€” â€” â€” 1 â€” 5 9 11 4 30 Females â€” â€” â€” 1 1 4 3 4 2 15 Tuberculosis (Non-Resp.): Males â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” 1 2 â€” â€” 3 Females - - - - - - 4 2 â€” 6 Meningococcal Infection - - - - - 1 - - - 1 Typhoid Fever - - 1 - - - - - - 1 Erysipelas - - - - - - 1 5 1 7 Food Poisoning 1 1 2 2 â€” 1 1 1 â€” 9 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 1 - - - - - - - - 1 Poliomyelitis (paralytic) - - - - - 1 - - - 1 Totals 90 594 775 1001 73 46 48 32 7 2666 TUBERCULOSIS There are three chest clinics serving the Borough, one for each of the three constituent areas. All are based at Cumberland Hospital, Mitcham. The Chest Physicians reported that, while the number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis remained much the same, lung cancer constituted an increasing problem. The high number of cases of bronchitis and emphysema presents serious difficulties which could only be effectively alleviated if more housing were available. They also reported a waiting list, for the first time, for beds in Cumberland Hospital; due mainly, in their opinion, to respiratory cripples who are kept alive by modern medical practice but require repeated admission to hospital because of recurrent chest illness. It was also reported that the general practitioner service of the Mass X-Ray continues to be increasingly patronised. The Authority employs one whole-time and two part-time Tuberculosis Health Visitors, and one part-time Tuberculosis Visitor, who work in close liaison with the Chest Physicians. In addition, for dealing with social problems of in-patients and out-patients of Cumberland Hospital, suffering both from tuberculosis and other diseases of the chest, the Authority employs a Medical Social Worker. DOMICILIARY VISITING All households from which notifications have been received are regularly visited. Intensive efforts are made to trace all contacts with a known case of respiratory tuberculosis. 20 Details of domiciliary visiting by Health Visitors are given below:â€” Visits in connection with old cases 963 Visits in connection with new cases 42 Visits in connection with contacts 264 Total 1269 B.C.G. VACCINATION During the year B.C.G. inoculation of school children in the thirteen-year-old age group was carried out:â€” Number of children skin tested 1753 Number found negative 1544 Number vaccinated with B.C.G 1537 No children with positive skin tests were known to be contacts with notified cases of tuberculosis. One-hundred and fifty-five of the children with positive skin tests were X-rayed. No case of active disease was found. INCIDENCE AND DEATH RATES PER 1,000 POPULATION During the year the following notifications of Tuberculosis were received: â€” Males. Females. Respiratory 30 15 Non-respiratory 3 6 The death rates per 1,000 population were 0.07 respiratory and 0.000 non-respiratory, compared with 0.04 and 0.006 respectively for England and Wales. AMSS X-RAY In addition to the general practitioner service, visits were made to industrial sites throughout the area and sessions were held for the general public. The service is of great value in the early diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis and non-tuberculous abnormalities. The results are tabulated below: â€” Number X-rayed Pulmonary T.B. found Primary Lung Cancer found Males Females Males Females Males Females General Practitioner Service 912 745 2 2 11 â€” Public and Industrial Sessions 10,776 6,727 9 6 7 1 Totals 11,688 7,472 11 8 18 1 DEATHS There were 13 deaths from respiratory tuberculosis during the year. The table of causes of death on page 17 gives an analysis by age and sex. 21 AFTER-CARE OF THE TUBERCULOUS The Authority makes an annual grant of Â£100 to each of the three T.B. Care Committees working within the Borough, to aid them in the much appreciated work which they carry out in connection with the after-care of the tuberculous. PROPHYLACTIC MEASURES The table below gives details of initial protection given by the injection of prophylactics against diphtheria, smallpox, whooping cough, poliomyelitis and tetanus:â€” Disease against which protection given Number of primary courses given Year of Birth Others under 16 years Total 1965 1964 1963 1962 1958/61 Diphtheria 1,042 1,265 153 29 126 37 2,652 Whooping Cough 1,041 1,255 151 29 45 2 2,523 Poliomyelitis (By injection) 2 6 6 3 5 3 25 Poliomyelitis (Oral) 384 1,723 192 81 183 48 2,611 Tetanus 1,042 1,264 153 29 201 173 2,862 The continuing need for immunisation and vaccination is brought home to the public at large by the use of leaflets, posters and displays, and by the teaching of the Health Visitors at the clinics and in the course of their district visits. RE-INFORCEMENT MEASURES In addition to the above measures of primary protection the following numbers were given re-inforcement doses: â€” Diphtheria 1802 Whooping Cough 1411 Poliomyelitis 2062 Tetanus 1734 POLIOMYELITIS At the end of the year, 80,193 persons had completed a full course of immunisation since the scheme began in 1956. The age distribution of these completed cases is given below: â€” Persons born 1943-65 52,106 Persons born 1933-42 15,791 Others 12,296 Total 80,193 FOURTH INJECTION At the end of the year 19,124 children, aged not less than five years and not more than 12 years, had received a fourth dose either by injection or by the oral method.

ANTE-NATAL AND POST-NATAL SERVICES Six ante-natal Clinics are held each week at Clinics in the area, at which an Assistant Medical Officer and a Health Visitor are in attendance. At these ante-natal Clinics cases are booked for subsequent hospital confinement. Post-natal sessions are also held on these occasions. In addition seven ante-natal sessions are held by midwives for patients booked for domiciliary confinement. Relaxation and mothercraft classes are held throughout the Borough at which health education on a personal basis is carried out by health visitors and midwives. Attendances at the ante-natal clinics during the year were as follows:â€” Number of women who attended for ante-natal examination 1137 Number of women who attended for post-natal examination 36 There were 374 midwives' clinic sessions at which 506 women attended. The total number of attendances was 2,883. RELAXATION CLASSES Ante-natal relaxation classes are held weekly by health visitors and midwives at the following clinics: Amity Grove, Church Road, Grand Drive, Middleton Road, Morden Road, Russell Road, Wide Way. The attendances were:â€” Number of women who attended during the yearâ€” (a) Institutionally booked 354 (b) Domiciliary booked 26 Total 380 The total number of attendances was 2,242. PREMATURE INFANTS The total number of premature infants born in the area during 1965 was 190. 25 Premature Infants Born at Homeâ€” Weight at Birth Born at home and nursed entirely at home Born at home and transferred to hospital on or before 28th day Grand Total Total Died within 24hrs of birth Survived 28 days Total Died within 24hrs of birth Survived 28 days 2 lb. 3 oz. or less 1 1 - - - - 1 Over 2 lb. 3 oz. up to and including 3 lb. 4 oz - - - - - - - Over 3 lb. 4 oz. up to and including 4 lb. 6 oz. 1 - 1 - - - 1 Over 4 lb. 6 oz. up to and including 4 lb.15 oz - - - - - - - Over 4 lb. 15 oz. up to and including 5 lb. 8 oz. 11 â€” 11 1 â€” 1 12 Totals 13 1 12 1 â€” 1 14 Twenty-two premature infants died during 1965. This means that 11.6% of the 190 premature infants born during the year died within a year. Only 1.2% of full-term babies died before reaching the age of one year. CHILD WELFARE GENERAL The Local Authority holds Infant Welfare Clinics at the fourteen premises listed below. Nine of these are purpose-built, the remainder being hired for the weekly clinic session. The Toddlers' Clinics provide a service very similar to the School Health Service. The child receives a detailed medical examination and a full range of specialist services are available, including the special clinics provided by the Education Service. Children can be referred to the Child Guidance Clinic, and the visiting Consultant is available to discuss individual problems with medical and nursing staff. These Toddlers' Clinics are an important factor in establishing the means whereby the developmental progress of children may be carefully observed both prior to entry to school and later in their progress through school life. The attendance at these clinics is often disappointing. Infant Welfare Centres being operated at the end of the year were as follows:â€” Amity Grove Clinic Monday 2-4 p.m. West Wimbledon Wednesday 2-4 p.m. Friday 10-12 a.m. Cavendish Road Clinic Monday 1.30-3.30 p.m. Colliers Wood Friday 9.30-11.30 a.m. Church Road Clinic Wednesday 1.30-3.30 p.m. Mitcham Thursday 1.30-3.30 p.m. Churchill Hall Clinic* Tuesday 2-4 p.m. Effra Road, S.W.19 26 Emmanuel Hall* Thursday 2-4 p.m. Lingfield Road, S.W.19 Grand Drive Clinic Monday 10-12 a.m. and Raynes Park 2-4 p.m. Wednesday 10-12 a.m. Meopham Road Clinic Wednesday 1.30-3.30 p.m. Mitcham Middleton Road Clinic Tuesday 10-12 a.m. and Morden 2-4 p.m. Thursday 2-4 p.m. Morden Road Clinic Tuesday 10-12 a.m. Merton Thursday 2-4 p.m. Pelham Road Clinic Tuesday 2-4 p.m. Wimbledon Friday 2-4 p.m. St. Barnabas Hall* Tuesday 1.30-3.30 p.m. St. Barnabas Road, Mitcham St. John's Hall* Thursday 9.45-11.45 a.m. High Path, Merton St. Luke's Hall* Friday 2-4 p.m. Strathmore Road, S.W.19 Wide Way Clinic Monday 1.30-3.30 p.m. Mitcham Thursday 9.30-11.30 a.m. Toddler sessions are held, by appointment, at Western Road School Clinic and at all of the above excepting Churchill Hall, Emmanuel Hall, St. John's Hall and St. Barnabas Hall. * Denotes hired premises.

Forty expectant and nursing mothers were examined during the year and 29 commenced treatment. This comparatively small number is due to the fact that most adults receive treatment under the General Dental Services.

Admissions are made under the following categories of priority: First Priorityâ€”Where the mother is the sole wage earner. Second Priorityâ€”Where there is sickness in the family, or where home conditions exist which are likely seriously to prejudice the health of the child. Third Priorityâ€”In exceptional cases, where, upon consideration of individual circumstances, it appears to the Council that admission is necessary in the best interests of the child. 28 The following table shows the places available and the average daily attendance at each nursery: â€” Nursery No. of places 0-2 years No. of places 2-5 years Total number of places Average daily attendance All Saints Day Nursery 12 34 46 44.8 Middleton Road Day Nursery 9 30 39 35.4 At the end of the year there were eleven private day nurseries registered under the Act, with a total of 250 places. In addition there were 7 daily minders on the register. CARE OF UNMARRIED MOTHERS AND THEIR CHILDREN Thirty-nine cases including one who paid all her own expenses, were admitted to various Homes during the year. Close co-operation is maintained between the various Homes and the Authority in order to secure the follow-up of the infants. CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS The Authority continued to operate the system laid down by Surrey County Council by which congenital malformations are noted cn the card notifying the birth. The following malformations were notified during the year:â€” Central nervous system 6 Eye, ear 4 Alimentary system 4 Heart and Great Vessels 2 Uro-genital system 3 Limbs 12 Other skeletal 1 Other systems 4 Other malformations 3 Total 39 WELFARE FOODS AND VITAMINS National Dried Milk and vitamins were available at all Infant Welfare Centres with the exception of Pelham Road Clinic, and also at Russell Road Clinic and the W.V.S. Centres in Merton and Mitcham. Sales for the year 1965 are shown below:â€” National Dried Milk 22,660 tins Cod Liver Oil 3,390 bottles Vitamins 'A' and 'D' 3,895 packets Orange Juice 58,837 bottles 29 PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING AND ALLIED SERVICES HEALTH VISITING STAFF At the end of the year, the staff position was:â€” 1 Superintendent Health Visitor. 1 Deputy Superintendent Health Visitor. 28 Health Visitors/School Nurses. 4 Student Health Visitors. The Authority has continued to operate a Student Health Visitor scheme and recruited four Student Health Visitors during the year, who it is hoped will qualify during 1966. Four Student Health Visitors recruited during 1964 by Surrey County Council, joined the Authority's staff as qualified Health Visitors during the year. Largely owing to their training policy, and that of Surrey County Council prior to 1st April, 1965, the Authority has had no serious staffing difficulties in this sphere. HEALTH VISITOR'S DUTIES The most important of the Health Visitor's duties is family visiting. Each Health Visitor has her own geographical area and, wherever possible, is based on a clinic within that area. She visits all the ' special' people in every family within her area; i.e., expectant mothers, new babies, children under five years, physically and/or mentally handicapped children and old people. The importance of this part of her work cannot be too gready stressed. Having access to the home, she is the one who can detect at an early stage any deviation from normal and can call in any special assistance that may be necessary. In the course of her visiting she is able to instruct mothers in Health Education and stress to them the continued necessity for immunisation and vaccination. In addition to visiting, Health Visitors attend sessions at Clinics in the area which include:â€” Ante-natal clinics. Relaxation and Mothercraft sessions. Audiology clinics. Vaccination and immunisation clinics. Infant welfare clinics. Toddler clinics. Parentcraft groups. Health Visitors attend case conferences and co-ordinating conferences besides writing reports and keeping records and must maintain contact with colleagues in the allied fields of health work. Long stay immigrants on their arrival in this country are visited to acquaint them with the provisions of the National Health Service. At the close of the year, arrangements were in hand to start a scheme of attachment of Health Visitors to general practitioners, under which they will be attached to certain group practices, rather than to specific areas. There are in Merton at present, two additional aspects of health visiting which should be mentioned. The first is the large number 30 of families moving into and out of the Borough. This is most probably due to a combination of high rents, mobility of labour and the fact that the Borough has housing property outside its boundaries. This often means a changing, and heavier, case load for Health Visitors. The second problem is the increasing number of coloured families in the Borough, mainly in the North Mitcham, Colliers Wood and Wimbledon Park areas. These families occupy more than the usual amount of the Health Visitor's time owing to their different habits and customs, and language difficulties. It is very often found that the women are anxious to go out to work or to resume their studies quickly after a confinement, and great care is needed to ensure that their children are not unsatisfactorily minded, nor left alone, nor inadequately cared for. SUMMARY OF WORK OF HEALTH VISITORS The following table shows the number of cases in the various categories visited by the Health Visitors in 1965: â€” Category. Number of cases visited. Children born in 1965 3,164 Children born in 1964 3,211 Children born in 1960/3 8,329 Total, 1960-1965 14,704 Persons aged 65 and over 369 Mentally disordered persons 242 Total 15,315 Attendances at Clinics and Centresâ€” No. of attendances at Welfare Centre Sessions 2,109 No. of attendances at Ante-natal and Post-natal clinic sessions 339 HEALTH EDUCATION This essential aspect of Public Health is being rapidly developed by means of teaching groups which the Health Visitors hold in schools, talks which are given to outside organisations, and Mothercraft and Parentcraft sessions which are held at the various Welfare Centres. Use is also made of leaflets, posters and displays. A film on smoking and lung cancer was shown to Parentcraft Classes, and posters were displayed at the various clinics throughout the area. There were no special lectures devoted to venereal diseases, but the topic is generally included in the health education programme, particularly relating to personal hygiene. The policy of displaying posters giving details of treatment centres has been continued. MIDWIFERY STAFF At 31st December, 1965, the staff consisted of:â€” 1 Non-medical Supervisor of Midwives. 31 9 Full-time Midwives. 1 Part-time Midwife. ORGANISATION The day-to-day supervision of the Midwifery Service is carried out by a Non-medical Supervisor of Midwives, who is also appointed as Superintendent of the Home Nursing Service, although the services are operated separately. For the most part, the arrangements under which three midwives covered the Wimbledon area, three covered the Merton and Morden area, and three covered the Mitcham area, were continued in operation. The three midwives in the Wimbledon area are housed at the Nurses' Home, Kings Road, Wimbledon, one in the Merton and Morden area is housed at the Nurses' Home, 'The CroftCommonside East, Mitcham, and the remaining five are in their own homes. Eight midwives have cars, in respect of which the Authority pays an essential user car allowance, and one midwife is supplied with a bicycle. MATERNITY CASES ATTENDED There were 452 domiciliary confinements reported and 2,486 institutional confinements during the year. Midwives employed by the Authority attended 451 cases (four where no doctor was booked and 447 where a doctor was booked). MEDICAL AID Medical aid was summoned by midwives in 134 domiciliary cases including 126 cases where the medical practitioner had arranged to provide the patient with maternity medical services under the National Health Service Act. The Authority is liable for the payment of the practitioners' fees in the other eight cases. ANALGESIA All the Authority's midwives are qualified to administer analgesia (trilene, gas and air, and pethidine) in accordance with the rules of the Central Midwives Board. During the year municipal midwives administered analgesics to mothers as follows:â€” Gas and Air Trilene Pethidine 303 130 235 PUERPERAL PYREXIA Fifteen cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified, 14 of which were hospital cases. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM One case of ophthalmia neonatorum was notified during the year. MATERNITY OUTFITS A free issue of maternity outfits is made in accordance with Ministry of Health instructions, namely, to those patients whose confinement will be conducted under the National Health Service arrangement. These are issued by midwives to their patients. 32 EARLY DISCHARGES FROM MATERNITY HOSPITALS During 1965 351 patients were discharged from hospital before the tenth day of puerperium. MIDWIFERY TRAINING The Authority continued to operate the Part II (District) Training arrangements formerly operated by Surrey County Council in this area, under which not more than five pupils from Epsom Hospital, and one from Woking Maternity Hospital, were received on the district for their second-period training. The pupil midwives are accommodated either at the Nurses' Home, Kings Road, Wimbledon, or in lodgings arranged with private householders. One midwife in the Mitcham area is able to provide accommodation in her own home for the pupil attached to her. POST-GRADUATE COURSES Three midwives attended Post-Graduate Courses during the year. HOME NURSING STAFF At 31st December, 1965, the staff consisted of:â€” 1 Superintendent of Home Nursing Service. 32 Whole-time Home Nurses. 5 Part-time Home Nurses. ORGANISATION There is a group of Home Nurses for each of the three former districts sufficient to provide for demands on the service. In the Wimbledon area, calls for the service are made by general practitioners to the Nurses' Home, Kings Road, whilst calls for the Merton and Morden and Mitcham areas are made on the Health Department. It is intended to make arrangements at an early date for calls for the Wimbledon area to be made on the Health Department, to provide for completely central administration of the Borough service. TRAINING Two Home Nurses were seconded for District Training. Five Home Nurses attended a Refresher Course. 33 CASES ATTENDED The table below gives details of the number of cases on the books at the beginning and end of the year, the cases added and disposed of during the period and the age groups into which they fall:â€” Age group Cases on books at 1.4.65 Cases added Cases removed Cases on books at end of period 0-5 years 1 28 26 3 5-64 years 182 611 628 165 65 years and over 627 1,139 1,146 620 Totals 810 1,778 1,800 788 The total number of cases attended during the year was 2,588.

Those patients who use these pads are provided with tarred paper containers for disposal of the soiled pads through the refuse collection service. INCONTINENT LAUNDRY SERVICE In conjunction with a neighbouring Authority, a collection and delivery service of draw sheets is arranged, twice weekly, to patients who have been recommended by a District Nurse. DOMESTIC HELP SERVICE STAFF At 31st December, 1965, the stalf consisted of:â€” I Home Help Organiser. 34 1 Senior Assistant Home Help Organiser. 2 Assistant Home Help Organisers. 2 Clerks. 1 Full-time Home Help. 163 Part-time Home Helps. ORGANISATION During the year there was a decrease in the number of Home Helps employed owing to the general shortage of labour. Despite strenuous efforts throughout the year to find additional staff there were 15 fewer Home Helps in December, 1965, than in January, 1965. Owing to this shortage it was not always possible to give as much help as might have been wished. The situation was somewhat eased by making fuller use of the Neighbourly Help Scheme whereby a small payment is made to near neighbours in return for assistance given to patients.

It comprises two separate schemes:â€” (a) The Direct Scheme whereby application is made to the Medical Officer of Health and authority is given, to those eligible, to have a fixed number of treatments carried out by any chiropodist on the Council's panel. (b) The Indirect Scheme whereby treatment is arranged by Voluntary Organisations. A number of old people are taken for treatment by members of these voluntary organisations whose work is greatly appreciated. Under either scheme, treatment can be given in the patient's home if a doctor certifies that the patient is unable to travel. The number of people receiving treatment under the service is increasing steadily and is likely to continue to do so. In the twelve months ended 31st December, 1965, 1,267 new applications for treatment were received. The following table gives the statistical picture for the year:â€” Category Persons treated in 1965 Number of treatments given Number on books at 31.12.65 Elderly 2,187 12,989 2,094 Registered Blind or Partially Sighted 31 144 29 Physically Handicapped 58 381 56 Expectant Mothers 4 4 Nil Totals 2,280 13,518 2,179 36 RIPPLE BED SERVICE Ripple beds (air beds having a mechanically induced rhythmic undulation designed to prevent bed sores), are available on loan to patients of the Home Nursing Service at the request of a doctor or Home Nurse. The beds are hired from the suppliers and 65 such loans were made in the year. SICK ROOM EQUIPMENT There are three Medical Loan Depots, one each in Merton, Mitcham and Wimbledon. Loans of medical equipment are made to residents in the Borough on request from the family doctor or from a Home Nurse. Owing to the heavy demand loans are reviewed every three months. The depots are staffed on a voluntary basis by members of the British Red Cross Society. The following table shows the total loans made during the year: â€” Item Total loans Item Total loans Air rings 113 Commodes 145 Bed rests 116 Cradles 63 Bed pans 162 Crutches 27 Bed tables 13 Feeding cups 18 Invalid chairs 138 Waterproof sheets 151 Invalid chairs (self-propelling) 3 Urinals 85 RECUPERATIVE HOLIDAYS Under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act 1946, the Authority is empowered to provide a recuperative holiday for persons needing it to complete or assist in their recovery to normal health, but who do not need organised medical or nursing care. A recommendation from a medical practitioner is necessary. A number of Homes in Surrey and on the south-east coast are used, the holiday being usually for two weeks. Forty-five such holidays were arranged in the year. FLUORIDATION OF THE PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES In accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 15/65 a recommendation was made to the Council that fluoridation of the public water supplies should be undertaken under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946. After giving consideration to this the Council passed the following resolution:â€” ' That the Council does not participate in any arrangements with the Water Undertakings concerned for the addition of fluoride to the public water supplies, but that the Medical Officer of Health in consultation with the Chief Education Officer, arrange for the supply and distribution of fluoride in tablet form to all children attending schools within the Borough 37 whose parents request such medication, and that the Finance Committee be requested to make the required financial provision.' It was later ascertained from the Ministry of Health that the Minister's general approval under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act 1946, was limited to the fluoridation of water supplies and did not extend to the making available of fluoride tablets as part of a Local Health Authority's arrangements for the prevention of illness, care and after care. The Council, therefore, decided to take no action in connection with fluoridation of public water supplies. 38 MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ORGANISATION On 1st April, 1965, responsibility for Local Health Authority Services under the Mental Health Act, 1959, previously operated by Surrey County Council, passed to this London Borough. The dayto-day organisation of these services is the concern of the Mental Health and Social Work Section of the Department. A Senior Medical Officer and a Senior Mental Welfare Officer have been appointed to this Section. The arrangements under which persons may be admitted to hospital under the procedures laid down for compulsory admission under the Mental Health Act, are operated by Mental Welfare Officers acting as Statutory Officers under the Act. The Mental Welfare Officers also assist general practitioners in arranging informal admission of patients to Mental Hospitals. Where compulsory powers of admission are used, the decision whether to take action or not, in any particular case, is solely that of the Mental Welfare Officers concerned, who may thus be regarded, on occasions, as the trustees of the patient's liberty. The Department was doubly fortunate in being able to appoint as Senior Mental Welfare Officer a well qualified and experienced Social Worker, and also in retaining the services of two former Surrey Mental Welfare Officers who operated in this area prior to the re-organisation. They brought with them a wealth of experience, local knowledge, and goodwill. One of these two Officers became the Deputy Senior Mental Welfare Officer. STAFF At 31st December, 1965, the staff position was:â€” 1 Senior Medical Officer. 1 Senior Mental Welfare Officer. 1 Deputy Senior Mental Welfare Officer. 3 Mental Welfare Officers. 1 Mental Health Social Worker. In addition, during the year, the Authority was fortunate in obtaining the services, in a part-time capacity, of Dr. R. K. Freudenberg, the Physician-Superintendent of Netherne Hospital as Consultant Psychiatrist to advise the Authority on aspects of the Mental Health Services. MENTAL HEALTH ESTABLISHMENTS The Authority operates a Junior Training Centre which provides 75 places (12 of which were temporarily in use as a Special Care Unit pending the building of the proposed Special Care Unit by the Mitcham Round Table), 32 places being taken by Merton children, and 43 by Sutton children. In addition 13 places are filled by Merton children at the Intermediate Centre (for children aged 13 to 16 years) in the London Borough of Sutton. The Authority provides transport for the conveyance of Merton children to and from these Centres. The Authority's provision for adult training of subnormal patients over the age of 16 years is by arrangement with Surrey County Council under which 36 places are available at Surrey's Adult Training Centre at Banstead. 39 In their Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the Health Services, the Authority have included the following:â€” One 80 to 100-place Adult Training Centre. One 15-place Hostel for adult subnormals. One 15-place Hostel for female subnormals. One 50-place Day Centre. In addition, by the end of the year plans were nearing completion for the building of a 20-place Special Care Unit by the Mitcham Round Table in the grounds of the Junior Training Centre. THE CASEWORK SERVICES These Services are operated by both Mental Welfare Officers, and Mental Health Social Workers, with the general aim of the prevention, care and after-care of mental illness. Mental disorder, or mental illness generally ranges through personality disorders, psychopathic personalities, subnormality and severe subnormality, to the educationally subnormal school leaver with problems. Over this whole range, cases need casework support to enable them to live in the community. Prior to 1st April, 1965, these Casework Services were administered from County Hall, Kingston, and the major part of the casework was carried out by staff based at this administrative centre. Since the setting-up of this Borough, however, the work of Mental Welfare Officers and Mental Health Social Workers has been integrated so far as practicable. A proportion of the supervision of the subnormal and severely subnormal is in the hands of the Health Visitors who pay routine visits to them and report direcdy to the Mental Health Section. There is a good liaison between Mental Welfare Officers and Health Visitors. SUBNORMALITY 1. CASES IN COMMUNITY CARE At the end of the year, 217 patients, as shown below, were in the community care of the Authority:â€” Category of patient Under 16 years 16 years and over Total Grand Total Male Female Male Female Male Female Subnormal patients receiving routine home visits 8 8 25 38 33 46 79 Severely subnormal patients receiving routine home visits 38 24 47 29 85 53 138 Totals 46 32 72 67 118 99 217 Patients included in above figures who are attending Junior or Adult Training Centres 30 18 24 13 54 31 85 40 2. JUNIOR TRAINING CENTRE The numbers of children attending the Junior Training Centre were as follows:â€” 32 from the London Borough of Merton. 43 from the London Borough of Sutton. Within the Junior Training Centre there is a Special Care Unit, temporarily housed there until the proposed purpose-built unit is completed, for the care of subnormal children with physical handicaps such as spasticity. Children attending this Special Care Unit, who are unable to travel in the coaches provided, are collected from their own homes. Under the present arrangement for training, children attend the Junior Training Centre up to the age of 13 years, at which age they are transferred to the 'Intermediate' Training Centre operated by the London Borough of Sutton. It is hoped to rationalise this arrangement in the near future to ensure that all Merton children being cared for at the Junior Training Centre, as well as the 'overflow' of 13 to 16 years old at Sutton should attend this Authority's Junior Training Centre, thus giving a continuity of training at one Centre for Merton children up to the age of 16 years. The table below gives details of the attendances at the Junior Training Centre during the year:â€” Merton Sutton Total No. of children attending at end of year 32 43 75 No. of attendances made during year 4,545 6,834 11,379 3. ADULT TRAINING CENTRE The facilities for the training of subnormals over the age of 16 years are provided, by arrangement, with the Surrey County Council, at their Adult Training Centre at Banstead. At the end of the year 24 males, and 13 females were in attendance. There was also a waiting list for admission of three males and nine females, but in view of the pressure for admission of Surrey's own cases to this Centre, there was little hope of any further Merton cases being admitted. To provide for the increasing numbers requiring adult training, and, as an interim measure, until the Authority are able to provide a purpose-built Adult Training Centre, negotiations were in progress at the end of the year, with the Physician-Superintendent of the Manor Hospital whereby facilities could be made available for Merton cases attending the Banstead Training Centre, and for those Merton cases on the waiting list, to attend a Day Centre at the Manor Hospital, Epsom. It was also realised that the facilities provided by Surrey County Council could be made available only so long as the arrangements did not prevent admission of their own cases to Banstead Adult Training Centre. OTHER FORMS OF MENTAL DISORDER 1. CASES DEALT WITH BY MENTAL WELFARE OFFICERS During the year, 365 cases were referred to Mental Welfare Officers for attention. 41 One hundred and eighty-six patients were admitted to Mental Hospitals through the Mental Health Service. Details of these admissions are given below:â€” Males :. Females. Total. Admitted informally 19 29 48 Admitted under Section 25 (for obvation) 8 16 24 Admitted under Section 26 (for treatment) 2 7 9 Admitted under Section 29 (for observation in case of emergency) 35 60 95 Admited under Section 60 (by the Courts) 1 - 1 Admitted under Section 136 (in conjunction with Police) 4 6 10 Totals 68 118 186 These figures do not include a large number of informal admissions arranged directly by general practitioners, or admitted informally through Psychiatric Out-patient Clinics. The informal cases listed above are only those where the Department has rendered assistance, and are probably but a fraction of the total number of informal admissions from the Borough. Mental Welfare Officers received ready co-operation from other Sections of the Department, particularly from Health Visitors, but also from Public Health Inspectors, the School Health Service, and the Home Help Service. There is also a close liaison, and frequent contact, with the Education, Welfare Services, and Children's Departments. Especial thanks are due to the Metropolitan Police, who make possible an after-hours emergency service. Doctors requiring the duty Mental Welfare Officer out of office hours telephone the Police who refer them to the appropriate Mental Welfare Officer. 2. PATIENTS RECEIVING COMMUNITY CARE Forty-nine male and 75 female patients were being provided with community care by the Authority, at the end of the year. The supervision of mentally ill persons within the community is carried out by Mental Welfare Officers and Social Workers and covers a very wide range of activities. This may be to assist patients with their material problems, or in supporting them through bouts of depression, or periods of more serious illness where admission to hospital is being avoided. Some of these are chronic cases and could not survive in the community otherwise. It is in this sphere that the Mental Welfare Officer often has the care of elderly people and the chronically ill. In all activities associated with community care a close liaison is maintained with the general practitioner and with hospital staff, wherever possible. PATIENTS IN HOSPITAL It is known from records maintained by the Mental Health Section, that 229 Merton patients are in long-term care in hospitals for the subnormal and severely subnormal. 42 Whilst, ideally, it would be comforting to think that it is possible for the Local Health Authority to be an effective link between the hospital and families, in many cases this is simply not possible, since the patients were admitted so long ago and have settled in their hospital environment, and their relatives have come to accept this position. However, in any case where one of the hospitals, or any of the parents or patients require any help, this Authority gives it through its Mental Welfare Officers. It is important to bear in mind that, when the Authority is able to acquire its own hostel accommodation, a number of these patients who are suitable for hostel accommodation, will return to the community. The actual numbers involved will, however, represent only a small proportion of those in hospital, due to the tendency for long-term care in hospital to render a subnormal patient unsuitable for life in the community. GUARDIANSHIP There are no cases under guardianship in the Borough. CASES BOARDED OUT The Authority, at the end of the year, was making financial provision for the boarding-out of eight patients. A particularly close liaison is maintained with the two Cheshire Foundation Homes in the district, and in addition to giving supervision to the Merton cases in residence there, the Authority has undertaken supervision of patients from other Authorities accommodated there, when requested to do so. SHORT-TERM CARE During the year, the Authority provided periods of short-term care in eight cases. SOCIAL WORK SECTION The Authority continued the arrangements intitiated by the Surrey County Council whereby Social Work staff are attached to the Cumberland Hospital, Mitcham, to render assistance to the Chest Physicians with both in-patients and out-patients afflicted with chest diseases. This staff is housed in a suite of rooms adjacent to the Chest Clinic in the hospital building and rented by the Authority from the Hospital Management Committee. This staff is also (increasingly concerned with case work on families at risk of break-up. Cases are referred to the Social Workers by the Co-ordinating Committee for the Prevention of Break-up of Families, and by the Health Visitors. This Section is under the day-to-day control of a Senior Medical Officer. At the end of the year, the Authority's staff in this Section comprised:â€” 1 Whole-time Social Worker. 2 Part-time Social Workers (equivalent to one whole-time Social Worker). 43 The whole-time Social Worker is qualified, and whilst the two part-time Social Workers have no approved social work qualifications, their previous training, it was felt, was of use in their present sphere. Great difficulty was experienced in recruiting qualified Social Workers up to the establishment approved by the Authority, and to ease the case-load in this Section, when a qualified Medical Social Worker left the Authority's service, a qualified Social Worker from the Mental Health Section was temporarily seconded for duty at Cumberland Hospital. The Medical Officer of Health is designated by the Authority as Chairman of the Co-ordinating Committee for the Prevention of the Break-up of Families. The Senior Medical Officer and the Social Workers in this Section, working closely with Health Visitors, maintain a close liaison with the Education, Children's, Welfare Services, and Housing Departments. 44 REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR INTRODUCTION This part of the Annual Report deals with the Environmental Health Service, and shows the efforts which have been made to maintain a service to the public, despite the upheaval caused by amalgamation. Initial difficulties were experienced in April, 1965, in channelling all the records into one basic administrative system and in applying the new system to the great variety of duties carried out by the Environmental Health Section. Staff changes and staff shortages were two factors which had to be, and are still having to be, overcome and although work was proceeding smoothly by the end of the year, some of the statistics given show that arrears of work are accruing. Much of the work of the Environmental Health Section is uuspectacular and anonymous in character, but the very nature of the duties involved bring the staff into close contact with the personal problems and difficulties of both occupiers and owners of houses and business premises. It is most necessary, therefore, that good public relations be maintained, but this is not possible if routine visits are few and far between, or if prompt attention is not given to requests for visits to be made, or if made, follow-up procedure is neglected. It is the endeavour of the Public Health Inspectorate not only to maintain but to improve the environmental standards in the district and though the volume and quality of work during the year 1965 has been good, it is hoped that the staffing situation during the coming year will improve so that a more complete Environmental Health Service may be put into operation. In reviewing the work of the Public Health Inspectorate during 1965 regard has been had to Ministry of Health Circular 1 /66 dated 11th January, 1966. The statistics given are for a complete year (1965) and the figures for the first three months have been obtained from records of the Boroughs of Mitcham and Wimbledon and the Urban District of Merton and Morden. SERVICES UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH ACTS WATER SUPPLY The Metropolitan Water Board and the Sutton District Water Company are responsible for the supply of water to the Borough and regular periodic examinations are made by these undertakings. Reports on examinations are also exchanged with adjoining Local Authorities who are supplied by the Sutton District Water Company. The supply of water has been satisfactory in both quality and quantity. With a few exceptions all the dwelling houses in the London Borough of Merton are supplied from public water mains direct to the houses but the actual number of such houses is not available. A number of industrial premises have an additional supply of water from their own deep wells. There are seven caravan yards within the Borough, each with a stand-pipe supplying mains water. 45 During the year 1965 samples of water were taken for bacteriological and chemical analysis as follows:â€” Bacteriologicalâ€” Swimming Baths 111 Paddling Pools 17 Dwelling houses:â€” Metropolitan Water Board supply 4 Sutton District Water Co. supply 2 Well water 8 14 Other premises:â€” Sutton District Water Co. 2 144 Unsatisfactory Resultsâ€” Swimming Baths 18 Paddling Pools 14 32 Immediate action was taken in respect of the unsatisfactory swimming bath water and subsequent samples proved satisfactory. The treatment of water in a number of paddling pools in the Borough will be the subject of a special study during the 1966 season. Chemicalâ€” Swimming Baths 6 Dwelling Houses:â€” Metropolitan Water Board supply 2 Sutton District Water Co. supply 1 Well water 1 4 Other premises:â€” Sutton District Water Co. supply 1 11 These samples of water proved satisfactory. Fluoride Content Information was obtained during 1965 that the fluoride content of the water supplies was as follows:â€” Sutton District Water Co.â€”a trace: less than .2 parts per million (not added). Metropolitan Water Boardâ€”.25 milligrammes per litre. Plumbo-Solvent Action One well water supply is known to be liable to have plumbosolvent action and the galvanised iron service pipe line to a dwelling house was replaced by Alkathene tubing in 1958. Subsequent samples have been free of metallic content. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL The previous Annual Reports of the three constituent Authorities indicate that the arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal are 46 adequate. There is a number of cesspools in the Borough and arrangements to empty them at intervals are made by the respective owners. REGISTERED COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no registered common lodging houses in the Borough.

The number of Distributors of milk in the Borough as shown by the register kept in accordance with these Regulations, is 139. 50 There are four dairies handling milk in bottles or sealed churns, and two pasteurising establishments, one of which also processes milk by ultra high temperature treatment. Milk (Special Designation) (Amendment) Regulations, 1965. These Regulations came into operation on 1st October, 1965, to amend the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963. Schedule 1 of the Regulations which refers to the special conditions subject to which licences to use the special designation ' Ultra Heat Treated ' may be granted, were applied to a dairy processing this designated milk. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963, as amended. The following licences, which will remain in force until 31st December, 1970, have been issued under the Regulations:â€” Dealers' (Pasteuriser's) Licences 2 Dealers' (Ultra Heat Treated) Licence 1 Dealers' (Pre-packed Milk) Licences:â€” Untreated milk 57 Pasteurised milk 121 Sterilised milk 101 Ultra Heat Treated milk 9 During the year 279 samples of designated milk were submitted for statutory tests. The results were as follows:â€” Designation. Satisfactory. Unsatisfactory. Pasteurised 243 â€” Sterilised 26 â€” Untreated 9 1 The unsatisfactory sample of untreated milk, which was taken from a vending machine, failed the Methylene Blue test. A further sample taken from the same machine proved satisfactory. Brucella Abortus. No positive samples of milk were found. lce-Cream. During the year 154 samples were submitted for bacteriological examination. The results were as follows:â€” Grade 1 114 Grade 2 11 Grade 3 16 Grade 4 13 Grade 1 and 2 samples can be considered satisfactory; only 20% of the samples taken from any one vendor should be of Grade 3 quality, and none of Grade 4. Appropriate action was taken in the cases of unsatisfactory samples. Meat and Other Foods. There is one licensed slaughterhouse in the Borough, which is privately owned. This slaughterhouse, which has been in use for a number of years, is old and there are many inherent defects. The layout of the premises is poor and facilities for meat inspection are inadequate. Following action by the Town Planning Authority in 51 1961 a Compulsory Purchase Order was made, and in 1962 the Mitcham Borough Council made an offer to the occupier of a new site within the Borough. It is hoped that steps will be taken during 1966 to finalise arrangements whereby the use of the existing premises will cease. In the meantime slaughtering continues throughout the week (except on Saturday) and from 6 a.m. to noon on Sundays. A 100% meat inspection service has been maintained throughout 1965. During the year, thirteen slaughtermen's licences were issued under the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958, two being licences to slaughter only under supervision. Meat Inspection.

The inspection of food premises has formed an important part of the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the past year. 4,375 visits were made to premises in which foodstuffs, intended for human consumption, were prepared, stored or sold. All food premises must comply with the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, and a considerable amount of work has been done under the Regulations during the year. In general, it has been found that food traders within the Borough are co-operative and I have reason to believe that the assistance and advice given by the Department is appreciated. The provisional register of food premises includes the following: Greengrocers 157 Confectioners 273 Ice-Cream premises 496 Bakers 48 Grocers and Provision Dealers 295 Butchers 104 Carried forward 1373 52 Brought forward 1373 Fishmongers/Fish Fryers 60 Milk distributors 139 Chemists 51 Licensed premises 84 Clubs 79 Restaurants and Cafes 168 Works canteens 55 School canteens and kitchens 100 Food stalls/vehicles 33 Places of public entertainment 73 2,215 The information required by Circular 1/66 in connection with the provision of ablution facilities, sinks and hot and cold water supplies is not available at this time. The number of food premises registered in accordance with Section 16 of the Act is as follows:â€” Registered for the storage and sale of ice-cream 464 Registered for the manufacture and sale of ice-cream 6 Registered for the preparation or manufacture of sausages 70 Registered for the preparation or manufacture of potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food ... 150 The number of inspections of registered food premises during 1965 was 784. Bacteriological Examination of Equipment. During the year 312 swabbings of articles used in food premises and catering establishments, were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for bacteriological examination. The results were as shown:â€” Article. No. of swabs taken. Result. Satisfactory. Unsatisfactory. Beer mugs and glasses 39 35 4 Wine and spirit glasses 9 7 2 Plates 59 52 7 Cups and beakers 77 65 12 Saucers 4 4 â€” Knives 37 33 4 Forks 43 42 1 Spoons 38 36 2 Dishes 1 1 â€” Scoops and ladles 2 2 â€” Draining boards 1 â€” 1 Food slicing machines 2 2 â€” In addition 17 samples of ice-cream server water were submitted for bacteriological examination, eight of which were unsatisfactory. Special visits were made to premises from which unsatisfactory reports were received, and the occupiers were advised upon principles of hygiene to effect an improvement. 53 Food Inspection.

The following is a summary of applications dealt with dining 1965:â€” Applications received (Form I) 9 Decisions not to issue certificates Nil Certificates issued (Form L) 4 Undertakings given by landlords (Form K) 5 Applications by landlords for cancellations (Form M) 3 Objections by tenants to cancellation Nil Certificates of Disrepair cancelled 3 Number of visits made during 1965 in connection with the Rent Act, 1957, were 56 Shops Acts, 1950-65. Prior to amalgamation the Public Health Inspectors of the three constituent Authorities carried out all the duties under this legislation. On 1st April, 1965, it was intended that the Town Clerk would administer those Sections of the Shops Act, 1950, relating to hours of closing, Sunday trading, etc. In May, 1965, however, these functions were transferred to the Public Health Inspectors. The Shops (Early Closing Days) Act, 1965, which came into force during the year, clarified the position created by previous Closing Orders which had been made by the three constituent Authorities. Shops in the Borough have been kept under observation and contraventions have been remedied. Action has also been taken in respect of general closing hours, half-day closing and Sunday trading. The total number of inspections made during 1965 was 217. Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963. Work under this legislation was continued during 1965 and specialist technical staff was appointed on 1st April, 1965, for this purpose. In general, the co-operation of employers in meeting the requirements of Informal Notices served has been most encouraging and no serious objection has been raised as to the manner in which the enforcement of the Act has been carried out.

Petroleum (Regulations) Acts, 1928 and 1936. The Chief Public Health Inspectors of the three constituent Authorities were designated ' Petroleum Officers' and carried out duties in connection with petroleum installations. On 1st April, 1965, by virtue of Section 50 of the London Government Act, 1963, the Greater London Council became the Petroleum Authority and all the records were accordingly transferred. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. The table below summarises surface rodent control work which was carried out during 1965. The inspection and treatment of sewers was undertaken in collaboration with the Borough Surveyor's Department. 10% of the total manholes in the whole sewer system were test baited, and maintenance treatment was carried out on these, and other manholes known to be infested, three times during the year. During 1965, 356 manholes were baited and only 32 showed evidence of rodent infestation. The Department continued to deal with rodent treatment and disinfestation work in Council-owned property within the Borough. 64 Type of Property Number of Properties inspected as a result of Number of Properties found to be infested by Number of treatments carried out including retreatments Number of inspections made including reinspections Notification Survey under Act Total Rats Mice Local Authority 35 46 81 42 11 57 296 Dwellings 809 3,620 4,429 593 248 840 9,342 All other including Business Premises 186 545 731 82 70 155 4,064 Totals 1,030 4,211 5,241 717 329 1,052 13,702 Other Pest Control Work. During the year 1965, 537 complaints were received concerning insect pests and the following is a list of the infestations dealt with:â€” Ants 36 Beetles 23 Bed Bugs 14 Caterpillars 1 Crickets 1 Cockroaches 1 Earwigs 3 Fleas 11 Flies 13 Gnats 2 Lice 1 Mosquitoes 14 Maggots 5 Silverfish 7 Spiders 2 Woodworm 7 Wasps 396 The incidence of wasps was again generalised during 1965, and it is considered that the service provided by the Department in the destruction of wasps nests plays a great part in the Council's Food Hygiene Policy. Ponds, ditches, open spaces and other mosquito breeding grounds were sprayed with insecticide during the year, with satisfactory results. Thirty-one complaints of nuisance or damage caused by feral pigeons were received. Pigeon traps were placed at suitable sites within the Borough, giving effect to a reduction in the number of pigeons. It is to be hoped that more concerted action by London Borough Authorities in respect of feral pigeons may be organised during the coming year. Pet Animals Act, 1951. Twelve licences to keep pet shops were issued during 1965. Twenty-seven visits were made to these premises and any infringements of the conditions of licence were rectified. 65 Animal Boarding Establishments Act, 1963. There is one licensed animal boarding establishment in the Borough. The Riding Establishments Act, 1964. This Act came into operation on 1st April, 1965, and provides that no person shall keep a riding establishment except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Four applications for licences were received, three of which were granted. The fourth application was not granted, the refusal being based on the report of the Council's Veterinary Officer. Diseases of Animals Act, 1950. No outbreaks of disease occurred within the Borough during 1965. Copies of Orders made by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in respect of outbreaks elsewhere of foot and mouth disease, anthrax, swine fever and fowl pest were received. Numerous Movement Licences authorising the transfer of pigs from areas covered by Orders to the slaughterhouse at Mitcham, were received during the year. Thirty-seven visits were made to the five piggeries which are licensed under the Diseases of Animals (Waste Foods) Order, 1957. for the boiling of foodstuffs for the feeding of animals. Clean Air Act, 1956. During the year 1965, 141 complaints were received with regard to smoke or grit emission, and the necessary observations were made and remedial action taken. Legal proceedings were instituted against a Company for contravention of the Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958. The defendants pleaded guilty and were fined Â£10 with Â£6 6s. costs. An application was made to the Magistrates Court under Section 16 (2) for an Order prohibiting the recurrence of a smoke nuisance created by a demolition contractor. The service of the Summons could not be proved and the case was not proceeded with. The nuisance was abated and did not recur. Twelve notices of proposal to install a furnace to which Section 3 (1) of the Act applied were received, and the installations were inspected and recorded. In 11 instances plans which were deposited for building byelaw approval showed in each case the proposed construction of a chimney. After examination of the plans, followed by discussions with the applicants, opinions upon the heights of chimneys in relation to Section 10 of the Act were sent to the Borough Surveyor. National Survey of Atmospheric Pollution. The Health Department maintains seven daily smoke filter and sulphur dioxide (volumetric) instruments which are sited in approved positions in the Borough. These instruments, which record smoke density and sulphur dioxide content in the atmosphere, are visited daily throughout the year and recordings are sent to the Ministry of Technology's Warren Spring Laboratory. Two standard deposit gauges are also sited within the Borough. These have a somewhat limited 66 use, but, nevertheless, serve to indicate localised atmospheric pollution. Recordings from these instruments are also sent periodically to the Ministry of Technology.

N 141 176 182 N 96 133 N Indicates No Recording 67 These tables, which it is proposed to publish year by year, indicate, so far as smoke concentration is concerned, an improvement in the area of Wimbledon No. 4 instrument. This is in a smoke control area, the Order upon which became operative in 1963, and the area is adjoined on the west by smoke control areas within the Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames. It is hoped that, as time passes, a comparison may be made with the past year's recordings. Graphs based on records are maintained in the Department and these are beginning to demonstrate the effect of smoke control. The records of sulphur dioxide concentration, however, do not indicate quite such a marked improvement and comparisons in future years will be the subject of further comment. Smoke Control Areas. During the year the Council reviewed the Smoke Control Area programmes of the three constituent authorities and a new programme was adopted. This provides for the division of the remainder of the Borough into 32 areas so arranged as to allow for linking up with those areas already covered by Smoke Control Orders. The position on 31st December, 1965, was as follows:â€” Wimbledon Smoke Control Ordersâ€” Order No. State. Made. Confirmed. Opera- tive. (No. 1) 1962 Operative 2.2.62 13.2.63 1.12.63 (No. 2) 1962 Operative 10.8.62 19.11.62 1.6.64 (No. 3) 1963 Operative 27.6.63 7.11.63 1.10.64 (No. 4) 1963 Operative 12.12.63 31.8.64 1.7.65 Merton and Morden Smoke Control Ordersâ€” (No. 1) 1961 Operative 13.3.61 13.9.61 1.10.62 (No. 2) 1961 Operative 24.7.61 20.12.61 1.10.62 (No. 3) 1962 Operative 29.1.62 14.6.62 1.10.63 (No. 4) 1963 Operative 22.4.63 30.8.63 1.10.64 (No. 5) 1963 Operative 22.7.63 11.12.63 1.10.64 (No. 6) 1964 Operative 22.6.64 24.9.64 1.10.65 (No. 7) 1965 Confirmed 8.2.65 16.9.65 1.10.66 Mitcham Smoke Control Ordersâ€” (No. 1) 1963 Operative 24.1.63 14.5.63 1.12.63 (No. 2) 1963 Operative 3.10.63 14.1.64 1.11.64 (No. 3a) 1964 Operative 16.7.64 15.10.64 1.11.65 Merton Smoke Control Areasâ€” (No. 1) 1965 Confirmed 21.7.65 11.10.65 1.10.66 (No. 2) 1965 Awaiting 8.12.65 Confirmation Areas Nos. 3 and 4 under survey. The area covered by Orders either in operation, confirmed but not operative, or awaiting confirmation is 4,355 acres. The total number of houses involved in these areas is 22,514. Comparable figures at the commencement of the year were 3,797 acres and 17,245 houses. The two Smoke Control Areas under survey at the end of the year will cover an additional 291 acres with 3,162 houses. 68 The total number of visits made during 1965 in connection with the Clean Air Act, 1956, for all purposes, was 13,535. Work in connection with Smoke Control Areas presented considerable difficulties on 1st April, 1965, inasmuch as it involved three separate systems of administration and varying stages of completion in respect of surveys, Areas and Orders, and a depleted staff. Nevertheless, these difficulties were overcome and the work was proceeding satisfactorily on one system by the end of the year, except in the case of Merton and Morden (No. 7) Smoke Control Order, 1965. The changeover was completed whilst maintaining good relations with residents in the Areas concerned. After the operative date of any Smoke Control Order, observations are made from time to time by Public Health Inspectors and Technical Assistants, to ensure compliance with the Order. Noise Abatement Act, 1960. During 1965, 115 complaints regarding noise were received and 448 visits were made. Many of the complaints referred to alleged noise nuisances at night and the majority of these visits were made outside normal office hours, for the purpose of observation and the taking of Noise Level Meter readings. Legal proceedings were instituted against the driver of an icecream vehicle for sounding his loudspeaker chimes outside the permitted hours. The defendant pleaded guilty and was fined Â£3. The Pharmacy and Poisons Acts, 1933-1941 (a). The Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. The Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1926. The administration of the Council's powers under these enactments is the responsibility of the Public Health Inspectors. It was not possible to make any progress in connection with this legislation during 1965 with the exception of (a) above, where the issue of licences was undertaken by the Town Clerk's Department. Housing Acts, 1957-1964. In accordance with the Ministry of Health Circular 17/55, details of housing matters are omitted from this Report, but I think that some reference should be made to the work carried out in this field. The implementation of the Slum Clearance Programmes of the three constituent Authorities continued, and, in addition, a number of houses were inspected, either for repair or for Closing Order or Demolition procedure. During the year the Council adopted Standards to be Applied to Houses let in Multiple Occupation, and 477 visits were made to such houses. The total number of visits made to premises of all kinds, for the purposes of housing administration, was 2,078. CONCLUSION Despite an obvious slowing down process immediately before, and for some time after, 1st April, 1965, a good standard and variety of work has been maintained by the staff of the Environmental Health Section of the Department. The continuity of the service has been maintained but staffing difficulties are reflected in some of the statistics given in this Report. 69 On 1st April, 1965, the establishment of Public Health Inspectors was 18 but, in fact, there were two vacancies. During the year two more Inspectors left to take up appointments elsewhere and one new Inspector joined the staff so that at the end of the year there were three vacancies. These vacancies represent several hundred visits, and whilst duties such as requests for visits, food inspection, meat inspection at the slaughterhouse, infectious disease enquiries and the like were given priority, work of a routine nature, i.e., inspections of food premises, factories and work places, stables, etc., and sampling work, tended to be curtailed or neglected. The Inspectors are also required to carry out a great deal of work in connection with the Housing Acts and by the end of the year arrears of this and other work were becoming an embarrassment. The assistance of the seven Technical Assistants in the fields of rodent control, smoke control, and offices, shops and railway premises administration must be acknowledged but, valuable though these Officers are, they cannot replace Public Health Inspectors in the carrying out of statutory duties. It is to be hoped that the staff situation may be improved during 1966 so that more time may be devoted to other aspects of environmental hygiene. G. H.

It should be pointed out that for the first three months of the year, the Service was that operated by Surrey County Council as a Divisional Service comprising three separate Divisions (Wimbledon, Merton & Morden and Mitcham) each with its own Divisional School Medical Officer. With effect from 1st April, 1965, the London Borough of Merton assumed responsibility as a Local Education Authority. Since the area itself has remained unchanged geographically, the collation of information for the whole year has presented no serious difficulty. The operation of the School Health Service during the year, however, has presented some administrative problems precipitated by the amalgamation of three Divisions each with their three separate systems and each with their own records comprising in all some 24,000 school children's medical records. This has inevitably caused some dislocation in the School Health Service, but by the end of the year most of the difficulties had been overcome, although much still requires to be done. On the whole, in spite of difficulties of amalgamation, the Service has run quite smoothly. There was little change in the establishment of Medical, Dental and Health Visiting staff employed in connection with the Service. The principal change was the retirement of Dr. A. R. Graham, as Divisional School Medical Officer for Mitcham, on 31st March, 1965. School Departments now number 83 and compared with 1964, the school population increased by 228. The percentage of school children whose general condition was found to be satisfactory on inspection was 99.98% compared with 99.90% in 1964, an increase of .08%. This percentage reflects the continuing high standard of the health of school children in this area. 14.95% of the 1965 school population were found at routine medical inspections to require treatment for various defects mostly minor in character compared with 16.59% of the 1964 school population. On notification of a case of tuberculosis in a pupil, an epidemiological survey was necessary during the year at a Secondary Boys' School in Wimbledon. A detailed report of this survey is given on page 83. There was a relatively high incidence of measles and chickenpox during the year, but apart from this there were no serious outbreaks of infectious disease. I am grateful for the help and co-operation received from Mr. R. Greenwood, Chief Education Officer, and his staff, and from Head Teachers, Teaching Staff and Secretaries of the many schools in the area. My thanks and appreciation are also due to the Medical, Dental, Health Visiting and other staff of the School Health Service for the satisfactory and efficient manner in which their respective duties were carried out in this inaugural year of the London Borough of Merton. I should like to make special mention of the valuable work of the 76 Chief Administrative Officer, Mr. W. Atkinson, who joined the department in May, 1965, and to Mr. E. A. Ayling, the Senior Clerk of the School Health Service section. I am also grateful for the support and encouragement so kindly extended at all times by the Chairman and Members of the Special Services (Education) Sub-Committee. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. J. DOODY, Principal School Medical Officer. 77 THE SERVICE The Service provides for periodic inspections of all children: (a) for whom primary, secondary or further education is provided by the Local Education Authority at any school or college maintained by them, and (b) receiving primary or secondary education under special arrangements made by the Local Education Authority otherwise than at school. The treatment of minor ailments, eye, dental, speech, postural and breathing defects, and of children with behaviour problems, is provided at Clinics in the area. Attendance of children is normally by appointment. Most other forms of treatment are provided by general practitioners or the hospital services. There is close co-operation between the School Health Service and general practitioners and the hospitals. MEDICAL INSPECTIONS Medical inspections are carried out as follows:â€” 1. On entry to school for the first time (including a vision test). 2. During the year in which eight years of age is reached. 3. On entry to Grammar, Technical and Secondary Schools. 4. During the year in which 15 years of age is reached. 5. During the last year in school if not inspected in the previous twelve months. In addition, special inspections are carried out at the request of teachers, school nurses, parents or other bodies when children are thought to be requiring medical or other educational treatment, and also on children to ascertain their fitness for part-time employment. The statistics of medical inspection and treatment together with other statistics are contained in the Tables in Appendices 'A' and 'B'. AUDIOMETRY AND AUDIOLOGY A sweep audiometric test is carried out by the Audiometrician on six-year-old children attending primary schools. All children who fail this test are referred to the school clinic for aural examination by the school medical officers. If the hearing failure remains unexplained, a second audiometric test is carried out by the audiometrician, and, if necessary, the case is referred to the audiologist for further investigation and possible referral to a specialist hospital department if required. Details are given below of audiometric primary testing carried out during the year:â€” Number of schools visited 38 Number of children tested 2,177 Number of primary failures 116 SPEECH THERAPY Number of sessions held (a) for treatment 550 (b) for consultation 62 Number of cases on register at beginning of year 187 78 Number of cases added during year 66 Number of cases discharged during year 69 Number of cases on register at end of year 184 Cases discharged during year who:â€” Achieved normal speech 27 Were greatly improved 24 Showed some improvement 9 Showed little or no improvement 9 Analysis of cases treated during year: â€” Stammering 19 Dyslalia 139 Cleft palate 5 Nasal obstruction 1 Cluttering 1 Aphasia 1 Nasality 1 Defective speech due to amontia 1 Defective speech due to deafness 2 Retarded speech 18 THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL NURSES In this Local Education Authority the Health Visitors are also School Nurses, and each Health Visitor has the responsibility of two or three school departments. Where it is possible, the Health Visitor is attached to a primary school in her own area, since she often knows the children and their families well. This is of value as there is in the main, very good co-operation between the Head Teacher, School Medical Officer and the Health Visitor. Hygiene inspections are carried out regularly in the majority of schools by the Health Visitor early in each term and 'follow-up' visits are paid either in school or at home where necessary. There is a link here with the Education Welfare Officers who are notified in cases of exclusion and are told the probable length of children's absences from school and the names of the School Clinics where children will be seen before re-admission to school. Routine medical inspections in primary schools are carried out with a Health Visitor in attendance. She tests vision and is present during the medical inspection by the School Medical Officer. This is of value because the Health Visitor can often give details of the past history of the children and she also knows the parents, which promotes a more friendly atmosphere altogether. At routine medical inspections in grammar and secondary schools there is usually a state registered nurse present. This has been found to be a practical idea, since the Health Visitor rarely knows the older children who often travel long distances to school. The state registered nurse, wherever possible, is allocated to a particular School Medical Officer, which builds up a good team relationship. Vision tests are carried out by Health Visitors in all schools where there are 13-year-old children, since there is not now a medical inspection for this age group. Where a possible defect is discovered by the Health Visitor at this primary vision test, the child's parents are offered the choice of an appointment with the Ophthalmologist at the School Clinc, or to make their own arrangements for eye testing. 79 The reinforcing injections against diphtheria and tetanus are given shortly after entry to school and Mantoux testing and B.C.G. vaccination are carried out by School Medical Officers with a state registered nurse in attendance at the age of 13 years. There are few minor ailments being treated at sessions of General Medical Clinics these days, but a considerable number of children are referred back to those Clinics from routine medical inspections by the School Medical Officers, who wish to see them and their parents for a 'follow-up'. The state registered nurses act as school nurses for these sessions. Health education in schools is a service which is generally on the increase in the Borough, and is proving of great value, although its scope is still more limited than is hoped for in the future. In general, the Health Visitor visits a secondary girls' school for one period each week, and takes a small group of children aged between 11 and 15 years for a variety of mothercraft and hygiene subjects. Because of the smallness of these groups, there is ample opportunity for discussion, and both the girls and the teachers are well pleased with the results so far achieved. HANDICAPPED PUPILS NUMBERS OF HANDICAPPED PUPILS The following table gives the numbers of pupils on the Handicapped Pupils' Register on 31st December, 1965, together with the numbers ascertained during the year: â€” Classification Total ascertained during year Total ascertained at 31.12.65 Blind 1 12 Partially-sighted â€” 9 Deaf 1 11 Partially-hearing 1 8 Delicate 8 27 Physically-handicapped 7 27 Educationally subnormal 37 150 Maladjusted 19 43 Totals 74 287 80 PROVISION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION The table below gives details of the numbers of pupils for whom special educational facilities have been provided by the Authority:â€” Classification Attending special school as Receiving education under arrangements made under Section 56 of the Education Act, 1944 Total Day Pupils Boarders In Hospital At home Blind 5 7 - - 12 Partially-sighted 8 1 - â€” 9 Deaf 4 7 - â€” 11 Partially-hearing 6 â€” - â€” 6 Delicate 17 8 - 3 28 Physically-handicapped 18 3 - 2 23 Educationally-subnormal 135 10 - â€” 145 Maladjusted 6 33 - 3 42 Totals 199 69 â€” 8 276 CHILDREN UNSUITABLE FOR EDUCATION IN ORDINARY SCHOOLS During the year seven children were reported as suffering from a disablity of mind of such nature and to such extent as to make them unsuitable for education at school.

PROPHYLACTIC MEASURES 1. Poliomyelitis Vaccination. Vaccination of school children against Poliomyelitis continued during the year. The actual number vaccinated or receiving reinforcing doses during 1965 was as follows:â€” Number of children vaccinated 240 Number of children given re-inforcing doses 1,993 I am pleased to say that no case of Poliomyelitis occurred among schoolchildren during 1965. 2. Diphtheria/ Tetanus Immunisation. Number of children given immunisation 163 Number of children given re-inforcing doses 596 I have much pleasure in being able to report again that there was no case of Diphtheria among school children or otherwise in this area, but the importance of immunisation for all children is in no way diminished. 3.

At the time, clinical examination and chest X-ray showed nothing abnormal. The boy was admitted to hospital in February, 1965, for investigation of a small haemoptysis, and in March, 1965, he was notified as a case of pulmonary tuberculosis. The Chest Physician recommended an epidemiological survey as follows:â€” 1. All pupils who had not been B.C.G. vaccinated, or who were not know to be tuberculin positive should be Mantoux tested, and, 2. All previous and present positive reactors, as well as those who had received B.C.G. vaccination should be chest X-rayed. Notification of the proposal to conduct the survey was given to the Chief Education Officer in May, 1965, and with the fullest possible co-operation of the Head Teacher and his staff, consent forms were distributed to parents of boys attending school to be included in the survey. Of the 875 boys in attendance (excluding the notified case of tuberculosis) consent was not forthcoming, or was refused, in 30 cases only. On 10th June, 1965, 280 boys were given tuberculin skin tests and seven proved positive (two of whom had already been tested previously with positive results). Arrangements were made for the Mass Radiography Unit to visit the school on 2nd July, 1965, when 413 pupils were examined, including the five unexplained positive reactors. Fourteen were already under the supervision of the Chest Clinic and 143 were absent for the X-ray as examinations were in progress at the school when the Unit visited. Sixty members of the teaching and ancillary staff were X-rayed at the same time. A further five who did not avail themselves of the opportunity had undergone recent X-rays. Twelve were absent, one had left, and one refused to have an X-ray. A note was sent to the parents of the boys who had missed the chest X-ray examination, similarly for those boys who had left school at the end of the Spring term 1963, when the possibility of infection first existed, advising a chest X-ray as a precautionary measure. 83 Following the survey, a member of the teaching staff was referred to the Chest Clinic for further investigation, and it was discovered that he was suffering from infectious tuberculosis, notification being made on 12th August, 1965. He was excluded from school, and admitted to hospital for treatment, his return to teaching being dependent on satisfactory recovery and freedom from infection. The Chest Physician recommended a further epidemiological survey, in consequence, after a period of six months has elapsed from the last attendance at the school of the teacher concerned. THE SCHOOL DENTAL SERVICE I am indebted to Mr. M. T. Gibb, the Chief Dental Officer, for the following report on the operation of the School Dental Service during the year. 'At 31st December, 1965, the Dental Staff consisted of five full-time officers, one part-time salaried officer, and ten sessionally employed officers, equivalent to 2.9 full-time officers. The employment of 1.4 Dental Auxiliaries forms a useful addition to the team. There were no variations in the full-time staff during the year, apart from my own appointment, which I took up in June, but various changes occurred among the sessionally employed staff. Orthodontic treatment was carried out on six sessions a week at the Church Road, Amity Grove and Grand Drive Clinics, and a smaller amount of Orthodontic treatment was also carried out by Dental Officers, either on their own initiative or in consultation with an Orthodontist. 'The dental scheme in the Borough begins, as regards each child, with its entrance into school life, and provides for an annual re-examination, together with arrangements for recall inspections up to the end of school life, with the opportunity for treatment, if necessary, after each inspection. The recall system leads to many more teeth being saved and thus there is a consequent reduction in the number of general anaesthetic extraction sessions. 'Children of pre-school age and expectant and nursing mothers are also offered treatment under the Maternity and Child Welfare scheme. 'The work of our two Dental Auxiliaries is confined to the four two-surgery clinics in the Borough, as their regulations lay down that they must work under the direct supervision of a qualified Dental Surgeon. They are permitted to do simple fillings, scaling, cleaning and polishing of the teeth, and applying prophylactic solutions. They are also trained to give instructions in oral hygiene, and to assist in giving dental health education talks to parents and children. They are particularly good with young children, and their work is of a high standard. 'Dental health education will form a more important part of our work, and talks, illustrated with films and demonstrations, will be given to Parentcraft Classes, perhaps the most receptive audience.

CHILD GUIDANCE SERVICE I am indebted to the Chief Education Officer for the following report on the Child Guidance Service:â€” GENERAL The work of the Wimbledon Clinic proceeded satisfactorily during 1965 and no interruption was caused by the transfer of responsibility to the new Borough. For the Mitcham Clinic, on the other hand, the year's work was disrupted by the resignations of the psychiatrist and educational psychologist. This is reflected in the attached statistics. Each of the posts of psychiatrist, psychiatric social worker and educational psychologist was vacant for some part of the year, and the last-named has still not been filled owing to the national scarcity of educational psychologists. 90 Other Treatment Given. Ailments. Number of cases treated. Miscellaneous minor ailments 452 Lymphatic Glands 5 Heart and Circulation 31 Lungs 75 Development (Hernia and Other) 39 Nervous System 13 Total 615 ESTABLISHMENT For the Committee's information the total establishment of professional staff to be shared between the two clinics is as follows:â€” 2 Psychiatristsâ€” six half-day sessions per week each. 2 Educational Pyschologistsâ€”full-time. 3 Psychiatric Social Workersâ€”full-time. 1 Psychotherapistâ€”full-time. REMEDIAL CLASSES Two of these classes exist in the Borough. The children attending the classes are all of at least average intelligence, and often well above this, but for one reason or another have fallen behind in their school work. The class in Wimbledon caters for seven schools, the Morden class for six schools from both Mitcham and Morden. Children attend for three sessions a week. The teachers spend some Friday afternoons in visiting the children's base schools and discussing their progress with the class teachers. Each class has an Open Evening on an average once a term and these have been much appreciated by the parents, a large percentage of whom have attended to discuss their children's progress. Initially children are selected through group intelligence and attainment tests administered in general by Heads or class teachers, and then seen by the Educational Psychologist for individual assessment. As a result of the latter, the child may be recommended for the Remedial class, individual tuition, in need of investigation at the Child Guidance Clinic, or for supervision. Frequent contact with both the base school and the Remedial class is maintained by the Educational Psychologist. Thus every child is kept under review and returned full-time to its own school as soon as this seems advisable. In concluding this section on Remedial classes, it should be mentioned that both classes are only able to function so successfully because of the help and support given by the Heads of the schools in which they are accommodated. There is a need to extend this service if teachers could be found. (The wider question of what special provision can be made for children who are backward but not ' educationally subnormal' is at present under consideration.) DIAGNOSTIC CENTRE FOR FIVE-YEAR-OLDS. One of the needs which, the Educational Psychologist reports, has emerged clearly over the last year is the need for a diagnostic centre for 5-year-olds. It is often difficult to decide whether such a young child is in fact ESN, maladjusted, merely immature, etc., and in any case one hesitates to label children of this age. The child may not be ready for the reception class and yet is too old to stay at the Nursery School or at home. Where a query arises, a few months in a small group under a teacher trained to observe such children and with the help of experts available, would provide opportunity for careful assessment. Where a child is minimally handicapped, careful observation over a few months can help to establish the area affected and how far the child can cope with a particular type of school. More success in ultimate placement of these children would be achieved, and the fear of failure and subsequent change under stress to another type of education would be minimised. Consideration will be given to the inclusion of this type of centre in the Authority's new ESN school. 91 PREMISES The Wimbledon child guidance team continued to work in the cramped and unsatisfactory clinic in All Saints Road, but it is hoped that they will be able to move to the newly-acquired Rokeby building, 97 Worple Road, in the near future. The Mitcham clinic premises at Sherwood House, Commonside East, are generally satisfactory. CHILD GUIDANCE SERVICE STATISTICS FOR 1965 (A) THE GENERAL WORK OF THE CHILD GUIDANCE SERVICE 1.
