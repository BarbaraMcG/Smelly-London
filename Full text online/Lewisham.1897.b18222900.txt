REPORT TO The Board of Works for the Lewisham District TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1897, BY Dr. S. BLAKE JOLLY, Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The number of deaths registered as having occurred in the Lewisham District during the year 1897 was 1348. Of these 69 were of persons who did not belong to the District, while, on the other hand, 91 persons belonging to the District died in hospitals and asylums outside, making the actual total of deaths 1370, as against 1482 in the previous year, and the corrected death rate 12.2 per 1000, as compared with 13.75 per 1000 in 1896. This is the lowest death rate for this District which has been recorded. The next lowest being 12.4 per 1000 in 1889. The death rates for the last ten years in this District have been as follows:— 1888 13.4 per 1000. 1889 12.4 „ 1890 13.9 „ 1891 14.5 „ 1892 15.6 „ *1893 15.1 „ 1894 14.0 „ 1895 14.4 „ 1896 13.75 „ 1897 12.2 „ The low death rate was chiefly due to the small number of deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs, there having been only 183 deaths from these diseases compared with 228 in 1896, and 329 in 1895. There was also a * The first year in which the corrected death rate was made out. 2 decrease in the number of deaths from zymotic disease from 258 in 1896 to 218 in 1897; and out of this number 106 were cases of summer diarrhoea, which was epidemic in children over the whole country during the hot weather in 1897. There were only 240 notifications of diphtheria, with 43 deaths, compared with 360 notifications and 82 deaths in 1896. Most of these cases occurred in the early month-" of the year, and during the last few months the district has been comparatively free from this disease. There were 355 cases of scarlet fever notified, with 9 deaths, as compared with 449 cases notified with 11 deaths in 1896. The type of disease was not quite so mild as in previous years. There were 62 cases of typhoid notified, with 10 deaths, as against 67 notifications and 10 deaths in 1896. There was no notification of small-pox. Population. The population of the Lewisham District, at the Census of 1891, was found to be 92,647, occupying 15,643 houses, distributed thus — Lewisham Parish, 72,272, occupying 12,317 houses, and giving an average of 5.9 persous to each house. Hamlet of Penge 20,375, occupying 3,326 houses, giving an average of 6.1 persons to each house. At Midsummer, 1897, there were in Lewisham Parish 15,270 occupied houses, estimated to contain 90,092 persons, and in the Hamlet of Penge 3,591 occupied houses, estimated to contain 21,905 persons. Total, 18,861 occupied houses, and estimated population 111,997, an increase of nearly 20,000 in the last seven years. Inhabited Estimated Houses. Populaton.

The registered births in the District in the year 1897 amounted to 2,088, an increase of 129 on the previous year; of these 74, or 2 7 per cent., were illegitimate. Birth rate = 24 per 1000. Males 1,304 Females 1,384 The birth rate in England and Wales in 1897 was 29.7 per 1,000 of the population, which is equal to the rate in 1896, and lower than that in any other year recorded except 1894, and is l.0 per 1,000 below the mean rate in the ten years, 1887—1896.

There were 236 deaths in the Lewisham Union Infirmary, 170 of which were those of persons belonging to the District; of these 105 were residents in Lewisham Tillage; 58 were residents in the Sydenham Chapelry; 7 belonged to Lee; and none to Penge. There were 66 deaths of persons who did not belong to the District. 13 deaths occurred at St. John's Hospital, Blackheath. 15 deaths occurred in the Lower Sydenham Home for Sick Children. 4 deaths occurred in the North Surrey District Schools. 2 deaths occurred in the Watermans' Asylum, Penge. The deaths of 91 residents in the District were 4 tered as having occurred in various hospitals, asylums, &c., outside the District. Of these 41 belonged to Lewisham. 25 ,, to Sydenham. 23 „ to Penge. 2 „ to Blackheath. Death rate for 1897 = 12.2 per 1000, the lowest rate recorded in this District. The death rate in England and Wales in 1897 was 17.4 per 1,000, which is lower than the rate in any previous year, except 1894 and 1896. Compared with the average in the ten years, 1887-96, the death rate in 1897 shows a decrease of 1.2 per 1,000. The death rate in Registration London, with a population of nearly four and-a-half millions, was 19.0 per 1000. The death rate for the "Outer Ring" of suburban districts, with a population of over a million and three-quarters, was 13.5 per 1,000. The death rate of the thirty-three great towns of England and Wales, with a population of nearly eleven millions, averaged 19.0 per 1000, ranging from 13.1 per 1000 in Croydon to 24.3 per 1000 in Liverpool. Zymotic Disease. The number of deaths from the 7 principal Zymotic Diseases was 218, as compared with 258 in the previous year, nearly half this number being due to diurrhcea. Scarlet Fever 9 deaths, as compared with 11 in 1896.

There were 355 notifications of this disease received during 1897, with 9 deaths, as compared with 449 notifications and 11 deaths in 1896. The cases were pretty evenly distributed over the whole District— Lewisham 154 notifications Sydenham 140 „ Penge 45 „ Blackheath 16 ,, Of these cases 101 were removed to hospitals. Diphtheria. There were 240 notifications of this disease, with 43 deaths, in 1897, as compared with 360 notifications and 82 deaths in 1896. The ca«es were distributed as follows: — Lewisham, 128; Sydenham, 91; Penge, 17; Blackheath, 4. A large number of the cases in Lewisham occurred in the early part of the year, and were part of the epidemic of diphtheria which occurred in the later months of 1896. It is interesting to note that there have been hardly any cases of diphtheria during the rest of the year in the portion of Lewisham which was attacked bv the epidemic in 1896. This is, I believe, owing to the fact that a house to house inspection was made and the drains put in order throughout this portion of the District. I had occasion to order the fumigation of two Board Schools in the District during 1897. This was done with the consent of Dr. Smith, the Medical Officer of the School Board, and in each case there were no fresh cases of diphtheria notified af er the fumigation had taken place. There has not been so much difficulty in getting cases moved to hospital as in the previous year, and I believe this accounts in some measure for the comparatively small number of cases. Home nursing of' bad cases of diphtheria, among the poor, almost invariably leads to a spread of the disease. There were 58 cases removed to hospital during 1897; and though at first sight this does not seem a large number, the fact must be taken into 6 sideration that a very largo proportion of the cases notified as diphtheria are of such a very mild type that there is very little fear of their spreading the disease, even when nursed at home. Nearly all the severe cases were removed to hospital. Typhoid Fever. There were 62 notifications of this disease, with 10 deaths, as compared with 67 notifications and 10 deaths, in 1896. Lewisham 27 notifications. Sydenham 17 „ Penge 15 „ Blackheath 3 „ Six of these cases were removed to hospital. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. The total number of deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs was 183, as compared with 228 in the previous year, and 329 in 1895. Of this number 12 deaths were attributed directly to Influenza, as compared with 11 deaths in the previous year, and 61 deaths in 1895. Inquests. Coroner's inquests were held in 76 cases of death. The causes of death were returned as follows:— Natural causes 35 Violent deaths 41 Of the latter 31 were accidental, 9 suicidal, and 1 homicidal. 17 deaths were registered as "Not Certified." Marriages. During the year 1897 there were 541 Marriages in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 363 were solemnised in the various Churches, 54 in Dissenting Chapels, and 124 at the Registrar's Office. During the same period there were 165 marriages in the 7 Hamlet of Penge, of which 130 were solemnised in Churches, 18 in Dissenting Chapels, and 17 at the Registrar's Office. Total for the year 706, as compared with 702 in 1896. The marriage rate was equal to 12.6 persons married per 1,000 of estimated population. Insanitary Dwellings. Proceedings were taken in October in respect of Brockley cottages and Closing Orders were made on the 30th of that month in respect of all the houses (twenty-six in number) These proceedings were taken under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Proceedings had been taken upon several previous occasions resulting to some repair being made to the Cottages. In November. 1892, I made a report to the Board and proceedings were then taken resulting in the closing of one of the houses. This house was subsequently repaired and. the Order was rescinded. In the following year further proceedings were taken on inv reports. Notices were served on the owner and summonses were issued. On the hearing of the same the owner called evidence to show that the houses could be repaired and the summonses were adjourned from time to time to enable him to do the necessary works. In April, 1894, it was reported that the nuisances then complained of had been abated and the summonses were withdrawn on payment of costs. Ag iin, in l890, further proceedings were taken and the premises were again repaired, but, although the nuisances were temporarily abated, nothing was done to put the hou es in a permanent stale of repair. The premises were kept tinder constant observation and in October I made a thorough inspection of all the houses which had again become dilapidated. Proceedings were taken on my reports and, as stated, Closing Orders were obtained on the 30th October. The difficulty throughout with these cottages has been 8 that, although on my first inspections the houses have been in such a state as to be unfit for human habitation, vet during the time between my first inspection and the later inspections, just before the case came into Court, the landlord always did a great deal in the way of "patching up," whitewashing and cleansing; but, on the other hand, never did the work sufficiently well to prevent the bad condition of affairs from recurring. Meteorology. The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich in 1897 was 501. The highest reading by day, 89.5, was registered in August, and the lowest reading by night, 23.3, in January. Rain fell on 167 days. The total amount of rainfall was 22 inches. I am, Gentlemen, Faithfully yours, S.
