BOROUGH OF WEMBLEY REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1955 E. GRUNDY, M.D., M.R.C.S., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health BOROUGH OF WEMBLEY ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the Year 1955 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1955. This Report has been compiled in the following five chapters, four with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services.

VITAL STATISTICS. 1. The population of the Borough in mid-1955 was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 129,000 and whilst this is considerably below 131,384 the census figure for 1951 it probably represents the most accurate figure attainable. It is an interesting observation that the population of Wembley and Kingsbury recorded in the census of 1931 was some 65,799, an inter-census increase of 99.7%. Wembley remains the fifth largest County District in Middlesex, those greater, according to population, being Harrow, Ealing, Willesden and Hendon. 2. In 1955 there were recorded 1,397 live births, giving a birth rate of 10.83 per thousand of the estimated population. The number of deaths was 1,045 giving a crude death rate of 8.10 per thousand. When the comparability factor (1.10) is applied the standardised death rate becomes 8.91, a decrease on last year's figure and below the national rate of 11.7 per thousand of the population. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 17.18 showed a slight drop compared with the figure of 1954 and is below the national rate for England and Wales yet it demands some attention. Prematurity of birth and congenital malformation are the main causes of death in very young infants and an emergency unit is maintained at the Edgware General Hospital which can be called to the house when a premature birth occurs to give immediate and skilled attention prior to removal if necessary to hospital. 4. During the year there was one death from maternal causes. 4 STATISTICAL APPENDIX A. CERTAIN VITAL STATISTICS, 1955 from figures supplied by Registrar-General.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital and the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital are situated in the Borough and these hospitals are under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross Hospital. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the Hendon Isolation Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley Hospital. Arrangements are made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included:— Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10. (ELGar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 8181.) Wembley Hospital, Fairview Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex. (WEMbley 3136.) Kingsbury Maternity Hospital, Honeypot Lane, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (COLindale 6309.)

A service of ambulances and sitting case cars is maintained by the Middlesex County Council as Local Health Authority at:— No. 4 Depot. (ELGar 5506.) The accident service is obtained by dialling 999. The authority of a medical practitioner is required for service to be given, except in emergency and accident cases. 3. HEALTH SERVICES. Health Services under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946, are provided by the County Council and relevant details in so far as they apply to the borough are included below:— County Medical Officer: A.

School Health Service. Clinics at all the Child Health Clinics. 4. VERMINOUS CONDITIONS. Only 8 cases, 2 adults and 6 children were referred to a Health Centre for treatment more intensive than could be given in the home. The generalisation remains true that infestation is scarcely a Public Health problem in Wembley. The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 5. MORTUARY. In previous Annual Reports attention has been drawn to the need for a new Mortuary. The old one which was built in 1903 to serve the needs of a much smaller population had become inadequate in more ways than one and the Council decided to close it. Its closure coincided with the retirement of the Mortuary Keeper who had served the Council in this capacity for nineteen years. It would be a pity to allow the opportunity to pass without paying a tribute to this employee who performed his duties in a most conscientious manner, with sympathy and understanding towards relatives of deceased persons, and with courtesy and a spirit of co-operation towards Undertakers and others whose duties required them to visit the Mortuary. Very few men are capable of and willing to take on this vocation and the Council may not find it easy to fill the vacancy when the need arises. 15 Plans for a new Mortuary (which will be more commodious and provided with modern fittings) to be sited at the rear of the Town Hall have been prepared by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor. In the meanwhile bodies which need to be accommodated in a Mortuary are being taken to the Harrow Mortuary by arrangement with the Harrow Borough Council. All efforts to share Mortuary accommodation with surrounding districts on a permanent basis were unsuccessful. During the period 1st January, 1955, to 5th April, 1955 41 bodies were deposited in the Wembley Mortuary. During the remainder of the year 81 bodies were accommodated in the Harrow Mortuary.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 1. SERVICES PROVIDED, Notification, investigation, pamphlets issued on the various infectious diseases, exclusion from school of patients and contacts, advice re milk handlers—Disinfection —Hospitalisation generally at Neasden Hospital or Hendon Isolation Hospital, re puerperal pyrexia and ophthalmia neonatorum, Emergency Bed Service, re smallpox as arranged by the Regional Hospital Board—Notification of tuberculosis—Authentication of travellers' inoculation state—Food poisoning notification and investigation— Scabies, arrangements with the Middlesex County Council— Complete bacteriological service available at Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, outfits distributed from Public Health Department. 2. There is little to note in this Section for the year, as the absence of any unusual infectious disease and the lack of any major outbreak of notifiable disease have not occasioned serious concern during the year. The incidence of common infections of infancy varies slightly from time to time and the figures in the statistical appendix indicate that the experience in 1955 was not unusual or in any way adverse. It will be seen from figures later in the chapter that there was one outbreak of food poisoning of which the Department was aware, involving 25 cases, although all of these were mild and transient. There is no doubt that a number of mild cases and outbreaks occur where the symptoms are so transient that medical attention is not called and the cases, therefore, are not notified. It would be a help in tracing the source of contamination it such cases could be brought to the notice of the Department at a very early stage when remains of the food eaten may well be available for bacteriological investigation. The result of these investigations would enable advice to be given to the kitchen staff where the outbreak had originated and would enlarge our knowledge of sources of infection and enable us to give more detailed advice to the community generally. 3. The supervision of contacts landing from ship or aeroplane called for routine surveillance of 16 persons regarding smallpox. Constant vigilance must be exercised on persons arriving from infected foreign areas and this supervision must be given with discretion and understanding. International Certificates of vaccination and immunisation were authenticated in respect of 739 residents intending to proceed overseas. 17 18 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

HOUSING. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. This Act which came into force on the 30th August, 1954, required local authorities to submit to the Minister of Local Government and Planning by 30th August, 1955, proposals for dealing with houses in their areas which appeared to be unfit for human habitation and suitable for demolition. The figures given were to be a broad estimate of the number of houses which could be dealt with in a five-year programme, and could be supplemented later as 24 stances warranted. Wembley is a comparatively new town and consequently has not a large number of houses which should be cleared. A Survey was carried out and 43 houses were included in the figure submitted to the Minister, 39 of which it was thought would be included in Clearance Areas and the remainder dealt with as individually unfit houses. None of the proposed Clearance Areas is large and the sites therefore do not lend themselves to extensive redevelopment. Of the 43 houses listed, 6 have already been demolished by the owners without statutory action being invoked by the Council, 4 have been included in a declared Clearance Area and in one case a demolition order has been made. Although the problem in Wembley is a small one, the rehousing of displaced persons is not easy having regard to the Council's commitments and liabilities for the rehousing of other families. Wembley has practically reached saturation point and there is virtually no land available in the Borough for the erection of more Council houses or flats. Section 26 of the Act provides that where an owner has served notice of increase of rent the occupier may apply to the local authority for a certificate that either or both of the conditions justifying an increase of rent are not fulfilled; the conditions being that the dwelling house is in good repair and that it is reasonably suitable for occupation having regard to the matters specified in Section 9 of the Act. The local authority, if satisfied that the dwelling house fails tc fulfil either or both of the conditions must issue a certificate in the prescribed form During the year 40 applications were received from tenants and 39 certificates were issued; one was refused. Where after the granting of a certificate the landlord has executed to the satisfaction of the local authority such work as requires to be executed, the local authority must on the application of the landlord revoke the certificate. 21 such applications were received of which 19 were allowed and 2 were refused. When the Act became operative it was thought that quite onerous responsibilities would be placed on local authorities and their officers by large numbers of applications with consequent inspections but this has not proved to be the case. One inference which might be drawn is that the permitted increases of rent under the Act do not make it worth while for landlords to attempt to raise rents on account of the risk of being put to considerable expense. 25 Legal Proceedings. In two instances legal proceedings had to be taken in the Magistrates' Court in respect of repairs which had not been carried cut by the owners following the service of statutory notices under Section 93 of the Public Health Act, 1936. The Court made orders in both cases for the work to be carried out in 28 days and allowed costs of £2 2s. Od. in one case and 8/6d. in the other. The necessary repairs were subsequently carried out by the owner in one case and by the Council in default in the other. Details of inspections made, notices served and works carried out at dwelling houses are given in the statistical appendix. Overcrowding. The number of cases of overcrowding known to the Health Department has shown a steady decrease during the past eight years, as the following figures indicate. Year. Number of Cases of overcrowding on Register. Total Number of Cases of overcrowding relieved during the year. Number of Cases of overcrowding relieved during the year by removal to unknown addresses. 1948 602 307 22 1949 558 268 86 1950 516 133 6 1951 517 52 9 1952 456 102 2 1953 424 52 3 1954 303 133 95 1955 204 108 102 It is interesting to note that during the past two years 95 and 102 cases of overcrowding have been relieved by removal of families to unknown addresses the significance of which might be that it has become easier to find alternative accommodation. 26 Household Pests. The number of bug-infested houses has shown a marked decrease in recent years and only 19 cases were recorded during 1955. With the advent of D.D.T. and B.H.C. which with their derivatives remain toxic to insects for long periods after their application, the control of insects has become a much easier problem. Fleas which in years past were quite a common pest are now very rarely encountered. Despite this great decrease in the prevalence of insects parasitic to man the Department receives many enquiries with respect to other pests as to their identification and control. In most cases the Department is able to indentify the species but in cases of doubt the Entymologists at the National History Museum at South Kensington have readily given their advice. The commonest household pests which form the subject of enquiries nowadays are carpet beetles, silver fish, ants and furniture beedes. It is also quite common to find that insects normally found in gardens and which do no real harm indoors have invaded the house and given cause for anxious concern to occupiers. The identification of such insects, advice on control and the assurance that they are harmless afford considerable relief to house occupiers. 3. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough, which is provided by the Colne Valley Water Co., except for a small area in the southern end of the district supplied by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Co., remained satisfactory in quality and quantity. The supply is pumped from deep wells in the chalk outside the Borough boundaries. All of the samples taken from piped supplies were reported as satisfactory. No tendency to plum bo solvent action has been detected. All dwelling houses in the Borough are provided with a mains water supply. There is a number of private wells in the Borough all in connection with industrial undertakings, but in no instance is the water from these sources used for drinking. The Council have continued to express their concern at the hardness of the public water supplies which expressed a total hardness range from 234—264 parts per million. Whilst there would not appear to be evidence of prejudicial effects to health from such hard 27 water its detrimental effects on boilers and hot water systems are well-known. 4. SWIMMING POOLS. The two outdoor Swimming Pools have continued to be a source of enjoyment and healthy recreation. "Breakpoint" chlorination or superchlorination which was installed just prior to the 1951 season has made it possible to maintain a sparkling clear water, together with a minimum risk of infection. Attendances at the Pools during the year were:— Kingsbury 135,598 Vale Farm, Wembley 106,901 5. FOOD HYGIENE. The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, came into operation on the 1st January, 1956. It is described as an Act to consolidate the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, and the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, together with certain other enactments amending and supplementing Part V of the Act of 1938, in relation to slaughterhouses and knackers' yards. All the older Acts are repealed by the new Act. One important feature of the Act is the power of the Minister Under Section 13 to make regulations as to food hygiene. After a good deal of consultation with representatives of both local authorities and the food trade, the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, were made and came into operation on the 1st January, 1956, except for certain regulations which do not become operative until the 1st July, 1956. These Regulations are a great advance on any powers previously possessed by local authorities relating to food hygiene, and except on a few clauses where doubts have been expressed concerning interpretation they have been generally well received up and down the Country. The main object of the Regulations is to reduce the incidence of food poisoning and there is no doubt that the studied observance of the Regulations by all persons engaged in the food trades could attain this end. Inspections and surveys of premises and trades affected are continuing. 28 6. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN CONNECTION WITH FOOD. Legal proceedings were necessary in the following instances:— Loaf of bread containing hessian cloth—defendants fined £2 and £2 2s. 0d. costs. Orange juice delivered in dirty bottle (2 cases)—defendants fined £1 in each case and £3 3s. Od. costs. Hawker selling food from a vehicle without being registered with the local authority in accordance with Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950—defendant fined £1. 7. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. The Clean Air Bill was introduced in Parliament in 1955, but at the end of the year had not yet passed into law. The object of the Bill is to implement the principal recommendations in the Report on Air Pollution:— (i) To prohibit the emission of dark smoke from chimneys, railway engines and vessels, subject to certain qualifications. (ii) To prohibit the installation of new industrial furnaces unless they are capable, so far as practicable, of being operated without emitting smoke. (iii) To require that the emission of grit and dust from existing industrial furnaces shall be minimised, and that new industrial furnaces burning pulverised fuel or large quantities of other solid fuel shall be provided with grit-arresting equipment. (iv) To empower local authorities, subject to confirmation by the Minister concerned, to declare by order "smoke-control areas" in which the emission of smoke from chimneys will constitute an offence. Everybody who has shown any interest in air pollution has been well aware of the shortcomings of existing legislation relating to this subject and it is to be hoped that the proposed new legislation will be workable and effective. Much progress has been made in improvements to food and water supplies and it is only fitting than the third essential to well-being, the air we breathe, should receive consideration. 29 The standard grit deposit gauge installed in 1952 to measure the total deposited solids per month continued in use. Expressed in tons per square mile the results were:— January 39.05 July 29.21 February 20.55 August 27.17 March 23.21 September 14.49 April 23.15 October 36.52 May 42.64 November 15.47 June 25.00 December 15.80 Total for year 312.26 Average per month 26.02 An increase on the previous two years. The Council are corporate members of the National Smoke Abatement Society and the Council's representatives on this body are Alderman C. H. Smith, O.B.E., D.L., and the Chief Sanitary Inspector. Alderman Smith was elected Chairman of the SouthEastern Division of the Society for the second year in succession and he contributed a paper under the title "Local Authorities, the Beaver Report and the Government Clean Air Bill" at the Society's Annual Conference at Bournemouth. The Conference received a better press than any previous ones, which is perhaps because Atmospheric Pollution is arousing more general interest than ever before. 8. HEALTH EDUCATION. Invitations were received from organisations within the Borough including the Education Authority, Townswomen's Guild, Toc H and other bodies, for talks on the functions of the Health Department. Many of these informal talks with slides, film strips and other pictorial material were given and they offer a useful form of health education. The two hours spent by a member of the Department on this work can give an insight into the scope and activities of the departmental staff which are not always fully appreciated by the public and therefore which the public do not fully utilise. I feel that talks of this sort, especially when given to school children about to embark upon a career, may be regarded as useful guidance in citizenship, in addition to instruction in the technical field. One member of the Sanitary Inspectorate gave 30 a specialised technical paper concerned with mould growth in the bottling room of a factory in the town and this was very much appreciated by the Divisional Meeting of his Professional Association. 9. INDUSTRIAL NUISANCES. The Council have continued to be faced with problems under this heading, particularly with regard to noise. Wembley can be considered fortunate in that there are none of the well-known industries characterised by noise which can be audible over a large area, but noise which is localised in comparatively small areas has been a source of annoyance and complaint in a number of instances. Section 313 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944, provides that a noise nuisance shall be deemed to exist where any person makes or continues or causes to be made or continued any excessive or unreasonable or unnecessary noise which is injurious or dangerous to health. There is a defence clause which provides that it shall be a good defence for the person charged to show that he has used the best practicable means of preventing or mitigating the nuisance having regard to the cost and to other relevant circumstances. This section is framed in such a way as to make its application not easy and the Council are alive to its limitations. Nevertheless every effort is made to secure abatement of such nuisances and generally factory managements are co-operative to this end. One particular instance of noise and vibration caused by air compressors has engaged the attention of the Council for several years but has not yet been finally resolved. The Company owning the compressors have spared no expense in obtaining the best technical advice and making alterations and improvements in an endeavour to suppress the noise and vibration. Unfortunately this is one of those cases in which residential property is contiguous with an industrial zone and it would have been far better if heavy machinery of this nature had been sited elsewhere. A further point which aggravates the situation is that the plant must run continuously day and night. In other cases greater success has been achieved. For example, one factory working day and night shifts had a dust extraction plant largely in the open air at the rear of the building which faced residential property. This plant caused considerable disturbance to the residents, particularly at night. The Company were approached 31 informally and they moved the entire plant to another position on the premises so that part of the building acted as a baffle. In another instance a wood working firm using mechanical saws and planing machines moved from their existing factory, which was in close proximity to houses, to another more remote. It is an axiom that the most effective method of suppressing noise is at its source but the strident note of mechanical saws cannot be suppressed in this way and the only possible means of alleviating conditions is by iining the building with suitable acoustic material and keepng al) openings to the factory closed. Lining whole buildings is a costly procedure and during hot weather doors and windows of factories are opened providing a route to the open air which offsets any interior acoustic control. 10. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The Church Lane scheme prepared by the Borough Engineer for the relief of surface water and soil sewage flooding was commenced in 1955 and completed early in 1956. Two relief sewers, one soil and one surface were constructed, which should obviate any further flooding in the area served. The soil sewer discharges into the Middlesex County Council trunk sewer and the surface water sewer discharges into the River Brent. A similar scheme has been prepared for the relief of flooding in the Preston Park area but the work has not yet been commenced. Two cesspools remain in the district, both of which receive only drainage from sports pavilions which are too remote from sewers for the premises to be connected. All dwelling houses are provided with water closets connected to the Council's sewers. 11.. RODENT CONTROL. The Rodent Control Service which is confined to dealing with infestations by rats and mice has continued to operate during the year under review. A staff of three "Ministry trained" assistants has performed the necessary work. No charge is made to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. 759 premises were found to be infested, 744 premises were satisfactorily treated by the Council and 12 premises were treated privately. 32 The following details of sewer treatment have been provided by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor. In April/May, 1955, a 10% test bait of sewer manholes was carried out. 341 manholes were baited and there were 51 partial "takes." In the treatment which followed 292 manholes were baited when there were no complete "takes" but 76 partial "takes." The corresponding figures for the 19th Maintenance Treatment carried out in September/ October, 1955, were — manholes baited 282, complete "takes" 1, partial "takes" 30. No new developments in poisoning technique were introduced during the year but Warfarin which was used very extensively during 1954/55 has continued to produce good results. 12. PUBLIC CLEANSING. The Director of Public Cleansing has kindly supplied the following information:— Refuse Collection. House and Trade refuse is collected weekly, with the exception that refuse from certain blocks of flats is collected twice weekly. The amount of refuse collected during the year was 27,800 tons The separate collection of waste paper from business premises free of charge has been maintained. The amount collected from this source during the year was 776 tons. Refuse Disposal. Refuse is disposed of by a Separation and Incineration Plant which has handled 28,600 tons. Salvage materials amounting to 3,212 tons were sold for £18,970. Waste Food Plant. The amount of kitchen waste collected in Wembley was 2,167 tons, which was processed and sold as concentrated kitchen waste for animal feeding. Street Cleansing. A new system of street sweeping by the use of pedestrian controlled electric trucks, each with an operator and four street orderlies, was introduced during the year. This new method has increased the frequency of sweeping to at least once every seven days. Public Conveniences. The use of the free washing facilities at the two staffed Conveniences in the Borough increased considerably during the year. 33 STATISTICAL APPENDIX D.

During the year your medical officers have acted professionally for the Council, performing 45 clinical medical examinations of actual or potential staff and have provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council. This activity helps in the provision of a medically sound personnel for all activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual case of sickness, thereby maintaining a standard of efficiency impossible without such a service. I am proud to record the loyalty and diligence displayed in the work of the Department, and I take this opportunity of thanking the whole staff for another year of conscientious effort. I would conclude by an expression of appreciation to all members of the Council, especially those who serve on the Health Committee and particularly the Chairman, for the admirable way in which they have directed the policy of the Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health.
