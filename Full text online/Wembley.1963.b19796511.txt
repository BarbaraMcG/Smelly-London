Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1963. This report has been compiled in the following five chapters, three with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services. Chapter I VITAL STATISTICS, Page 6, Statistical Appendix A, Pages 7-13. II GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES, Pages 14-18. „ III INFECTIOUS DISEASES, Page 19, Statistical Appendix B, Pages 20-25. „ IV ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE, FOOD AND WATER, HOUSING, FACTORIES, ETC., Pages 26-37, Statistical Appendix C, Pages 38-52. „ V ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND STAFF, Page 53. 5 6 CHAPTER I. VITAL STATISTICS 1. The population of the Borough in mid-1963 was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 124,610. The census of April, 1961, reveals a figure of 124,892. 2. In 1963 there were recorded 1,805 live births, giving a crude birth rate of 14.5 per thousand estimated population. The Registrar General has provided boroughs with a comparability factor for this calculation which takes into account the relative proportion of women of child bearing age in the total community. When this factor of 1.05 is applied the standardised birth rate becomes 15.2, a more realistic figure, the origin of which, however, must be remembered when comparing it with past years. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 13.3 compares very favourably with the national rate of 20.9 per thousand and this is often used as a pointer to the adequacy of the services provided. This figure would have seemed quite unattainable a few years ago and indicates the advances in obstetrics and paediatrics which have become available in the district in recent years. 4. The number of deaths totalled 1,287, giving a crude death rate of 10.33 per thousand. The comparability factor when applied produces a standardised death rate of 11.36, again well below the national rate. 5. Cancer of the lung and bronchus continues to be by far the commonest site of fatal malignant disease. During the year there was a total of 72 deaths (54 male and 18 female) as compared with deaths from the same cause during the five preceding years :- Male. Female.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital is administered by the Mount Vernon Group, and the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the West Hendon Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley Hospital. Arrangements are made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included :- Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10. (ELGar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 2381.) Wembley Hospital, Fairview Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex (WEMbley 3136.) Kingsbury Maternity Hospital, Honeypot Lane, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (COLindale 6309.)

The planning of a new hospital at Northwick Park is still under discussion between the Ministry and the Regional Hospital Board. 2. AMBULANCE SERVICE. A service of ambulances and sitting case cars is maintained by the Middlesex County Council as Local Health Authority at:- No. 4 Depot. (DRYden 0251) The accident service is obtained by dialling 999. The authority of a medical practitioner is required for service to be given, except in emergency and accident cases. 3. HEALTH SERVICES.

NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS — COMPULSORY REMOVAL. Power is given to the Medical Officer of Health to make application to a Magistrate, if necessary ex parte, for the compulsory removal of any person who is suffering from a grave or chronic disease and is not obtaining or is not able to give to himself the care and attention necessary to his condition. During the very severe weather of the first months of this year conditions deteriorated in the homes of many elderly persons and it was necessary to invoke the use of this legislation for two compulsory removals-one man and one woman. This action is described in the Annual Report, as the compulsory removal of an individual from his home is undertaken only in dire emergency and calls for recognition of the fact that the action is, although directed to the welfare of the person involved, none the less arbitrary and oppressive. 17 5. VERMINOUS CONDITIONS. No cases of infestation were discovered. The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 6. MORTUARY. The Mortuary, situated at the rear of the Town Hall, received 176 bodies during the year. Reciprocal arrangements have been made with Harrow to cover absences of attendants due to holidays, sickness, etc. 7. OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE. In October, 1962, a member of the Department was appointed Honorary Secretary to the Borough of Wembley Old People's Welfare Committee. This has enabled the various services which are the responsibility of the Borough Council and Middlesex County Council to be co-ordinated with those given by the voluntary organisations which help the elderly. Cases brought to the notice of the Committee and found to require the specialist advice of a Health Inspector, Health Visitor or the Area Welfare Officer are referred to the appropriate office. Similarly these officers approach the Honorary Secretary if a voluntary service is required, e.g., a visitor or help with the garden. The Housing Department also work closely with the Honorary Secretary regarding voluntary services for their elderly residents. There are 25 clubs in the Borough run by various organisations, and from time to time a bulletin is issued keeping them informed of help needed and any new facilities which are available. Welfare foods consisting of Complan, Horlicks, Ovaltine, Bovril and Marmite are distributed to Clubs and the Guild of Social Service for sale at cost price. A booklet has been published setting out the services available to the elderly and 4,000 copies have been distributed. 18 CHAPTER III. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 1. The year was notable for the absence of any outbreak of major infection and particularly for the absence of poliomyelitis from the Borough during the whole period. Measles paid its biennial visit and 1,269 cases were notified, most of a mild and transient nature and without any case terminating fatally. 2. FOOD POISONING. The total of cases notified during the year was 5, but none of these was from outbreaks. It is certain that many sporadic cases occur which are not notified but equally probable that all major incidents are discovered and investigated. 3. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF IMMUNISATION. The Department continues to authenticate the International Certificates of Vaccination for travellers who have received inoculations from Wembley practitioners. During the year 1,468 certificates received attention in the Department. 19 STATISTICAL APPENDIX B. Monthly incidence of the Infectious Diseases. Disease. January February. March April. Ma). June.

When major events occur at the Stadium a substantial number of hawkers and street traders invariably attempt to pursue their calling in the neighbourhood of the Stadium, and for many years the Department has endeavoured to exercise control over those concerned with the vending of foodstuffs. With this object, special visits were paid to the neighbourhood of the Stadium when eight important events took place, and inspections made of sixty-three vehicles or stalls. Twenty-three making a first appearance were " warned off " for failure to register under the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, or lapses in hygiene, and did not return during the season. Sixteen summonses for persistent infringements of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, were still pending at the end of the year, and one apparently incorrigible offender was fined, on seven counts, a total of £70 10s. Od. and £15 15s. Od. costs, with the alternative of thirteen months' imprisonment. This being the sixth time cases had been proved by this Authority alone, against him, the defendant announced his intention of following another occupation in future. 2. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 : Section 3 : New Furnaces. A dual obligation is imposed upon any person who installs a new furnace in industrial premises or a new furnace of an output greater than 55,000 British Thermal Units per hour in domestic premises, (a) to install only such a furnace which is, so far as practicable, capable of being operated continuously without emitting smoke when burning fuel of the type for which it was designed, and (b) to notify the local authority of his intention to install the furnace. 26 During the year the Health Department became aware, by notification or otherwise, of the installation of furnaces, which appear to meet the requirements of the section, in existing buildings as follows:— Solid Oil-fired. Gas-fired smokeless fuel. Industrial premises 4 1 — Commercial premises 6 2 — Dwellings 25 31 2 The use of three unsatisfactory industrial incinerators was discontinued, and four of an acceptable type installed. Two existing industrial furnaces were converted to oil-burning. Furnaces proposed in new buildings were as follows:— Solid Oil-fired. Gas-fired smokeless fuel. Industrial premises 3 — — Commercial premises 12 11 — Section 10 : New Industrial Chimneys. When the deposited plans for the erection or extension of a building other than a dwelling, shop or office, include the provision of a chimney, the local authority must be satisfied that the height of the chimney will be sufficient to disperse adequately any smoke, grit, dust or gases emitted from it. During the year agreement was reached in respect of suitable heights for five new chimneys. Section 11 : Smoke Control Areas. Wembley No. 6 (Mount Stewart) Smoke Control Order, 1962. Wembley No. 7 (Northwick Park) Smoke Control Order, 1962. Wembley No. 8 (Chalkhill) Smoke Control Order, 1962. Wembley No. 9 (Lyon Park) Smoke Control Order, 1963. 27 In the year under review the first three Orders came into full operation and the last three Orders were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. A further three thousand buildings of all kinds occupying an area of nine hundred and fifty-six acres thereby became subject to control. It is thought that as a result some one thousand seven hundred tons of raw coal will not longer be inefficiently burnt in open domestic fireplaces each year and some forty-two tons less smoke will be emitted at the comparatively low level of house chimneys. In meeting claims for grant which were received for works of improvement to the heating arrangements at 540 houses in the areas, the net cost to the Council was £2,300 (including £6 spent on 1 Council-owned property). Area No. 8 includes a substantial industrial estate (the Exhibition Grounds) of two hundred and forty-five acres comprising one hundred and fifty-four factories, offices, and other non-residential buildings, in which there are one hundred and seventy-three space heating or process furnaces consuming, per annum, an estimated five hundred tons of coal, two hundred tons of waste wood, nine hundred tons of coke and five thousand eight hundred tons of fueloil. The exemptions allowed for the two premises burning woodwaste and coal imposed conditions calculated to reduce the emission of smoke to an absolute minimum. Wembley Smoke Control Orders Nos. 1—5, 1960-1961. The areas covered by these Orders have been under surveillance during the year and no contraventions calling for formal action have been observed. Section 24 : Building Byelaw 115A. Appliances for heating and cooking installed in new buildings must, in general, be capable of burning smokeless fuel, although there is no obligation on the part of the occupier to do so until the area in which the building is situated becomes the subject of a smoke control order. The proper installation of suitable appliances in new houses 28 at the time of erection has been particularly important during the past six years since any house built after 5th July, 1956, does not qualify for grant in case any works of adaptation to fireplaces become necessary to comply with a smoke control order. During the year, under the supervision of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Building Inspection Section, there were erected and equipped in accordance with the requirements of this byelaw:— Privately built dwellings 87 Council built dwellings 16 Section 25 : Measurement of atmospheric pollution. Thanks to the willing co-operation of the headmasters and staff of the three schools concerned and of the management and staff of the research laboratory, daily recording of the smoke and sulphur dioxide content of the air, has remained in progress throughout the year at the four measuring stations set up by the Department at:— Kingsbury County Grammar School. Wembley County Grammar School. Claremont County Secondary School. G.E.C. Research Laboratories, First Way, Exhibition Grounds. The early part of the year was notable for the severity of the winter, but the later part had no parallel with the fogs which were such a feature of 1962 and as a result the very high concentrations then recorded, do not appear in this year's figures which are given as daily averages in each monthly recording period in the following tables (the periods are of four or five weeks rather than calendar months). 29 Average Daily Concentrations.

(1) With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, plans deposited for planning consent or approval under the building byelaws, which show that car parking spaces are to be provided in a building, are examined in this Department. A licence is necessary when there is likely to be an aggregate of more than sixty gallons of petroleum-spirit kept in the fuel tanks of motor vehicles, and in granting a licence the Council imposes the conditions recommended by the Home Office. Where less than sixty gallons is to be kept in this manner the premises must comply with conditions set out in the Petroleum-Spirit (Motor Vehicles, etc.) Regulations, 1929. During the year there were examined three proposals which came within the scope of the Regulations and four to which licensing conditions were applicable. The first semi-basement park for 60 cars was completed and licensed. (2) Ullage tests on 30 underground petrol tanks over twenty years old, and totalling 28,500 gallons capacity, were made, and one 500-gallon tank was tested with nitrogen under pressure. As a result, one 500-gallon tank found to be leaking was removed. In addition, the use of 8 tanks for the storage of petroleum spirit was discontinued for various reasons, four being filled with concrete, three with water pending possible re-use and one used, after thorough cleansing, for the storage of paraffin. (3) Two new tanks of a total capacity of 6,000 gallons were installed during the year and tested to the satisfaction of the Inspectors, and the number of new pumps of approved pattern installed was three. One 500-gallon tank was brought back into use after being subjected to a pressure test. (4) One unlicensed store of petroleum-spirit was found and closed. (5) Number of premises licensed to store spirit or mixtures 143 Aggregate amount of petroleum-spirit and mixtures stored under licence (in gallons) 359,026 Number of visits of inspection made to premises 280 Amount of fees received (Based on the scale confirmed in 1928) £141 14s. 9d. 31 4. HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION. The situation in respect of the multiple occupation of houses in Wembley has by no means reached a point at which control should give rise to serious difficulty. Details of all cases of which the Department becomes aware are firstly referred to the Town Planning Section of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department, in order that consideration may be given to the grant of planning permission, if necessary. Where permission is granted, or the user of the premises is sufficiently long established not to require permission, action is recommended under the Housing Act, 1961, sections 15 and/or 19 to secure the provision of appropriate amenities for the occupiers in accordance with the following standards adopted by the Council in May, 1962. (1) Natural and artificial lighting and ventilation. (a) Natural lighting and ventilation shall be secured in every bedroom, living room and kitchen by the provision of a window or windows in accordance with the requirements of the current Building Byelaws relating to habitable rooms; and the height of rooms to be so used shall be in accordance with the Building Byelaws. (b) In any watercloset apartment used in common there shall be, in addition to a window conforming to the above requirements, permanent means of ventilation. (c) Artificial lighting shall be provided in the form of electric lights so as to give a degree of illumination at table top level equal to two-and-a-half foot candles in bedrooms, five foot candles in living rooms and eight foot candles in kitchens. (d) Any staircase used in common, and any passage or landing connected therewith shall be provided with adequate means of electric lighting. 32 (2) Personal washing facilities. (a) For every eight persons including children over the age of one year there shall be a fixed bath or shower, in a separate bathroom, with adequate supplies of running hot and cold water and proper drainage, and (b) For every eight persons including children over the age of one year there shall be provided a wash hand basin with running hot and cold water and proper drainage. (3) Drainage and sanitary conveniences. For every eight persons including children over the age of one year there shall be provided one watercloset. (4) Water supply and facilities for the storage, preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of waste water. In respect of each separate letting, there shall be provided, suitable means of cooking and storing food, and a sink with proper drainage and a supply of running hot water and mains water, for the exclusive use of each tenant or household. Where, however, there is a common kitchen provided on each storey on which there are rooms separately occupied, there need only be one sink in that kitchen for common use. (5) Installations for space heating or for the use of space heating appliances. Rooms used as living rooms or bed-sitting rooms shall have installed either— (a) an open fire in good repair and suitable fuel storage accommodation, or (b) a fixed gas-fire with an adequate flue, or (c) a fixed electric fire or a power point for use with a portable electric space heating appliance. 33 At the end of the year the position was as follows:— Cases outstanding from 1962 6 New cases investigated in 1963 10 16 Found not to be multiple occupation 3 Ceased to be so occupied 3 Conforming to Council's standards 2 Section 19 Directions issued 3 Awaiting planning permission or enforcement action 5 16 5. COURT PROCEEDINGS. Apart from the case taken against the hawker already mentioned, it was found necessary to proceed in the magistrates' courts on another five occasions. Two cases were taken against the proprietors of food premises whose standards of cleanliness had deteriorated seriously despite frequent representations by the Department resulting in fines of £54 0s. Od. (plus £6 0s. Od. costs) in respect of a dirty bakehouse, and £63 0s. Od. (plus £10 0s. Od. costs) in respect of a dirty restaurant kitchen. For failure to abate nuisance within the specified time in two cases, costs totalling £10 10s. Od. were awarded against a property company, and for failing to maintain sanitary conveniences in a proper state of cleanliness the occupiers of a factory were fined £30 0s. Od. and the Council awarded £15 15s. Od. costs. For the first time in several years, no prosecutions were taken in respect of foreign matter in food. Of the seventeen complaints considered, the Health Committee felt that no action was warranted in five cases, and that a warning letter to the several manufacturers adequately met the circumstances for the rest. 34 6. PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS. Two open-air public swimming baths are provided in the area and serve the general public during the summer period, usually from May to September. The Vale Farm Pool is 55 yards long and 25 yards wide with a maximum depth of 9 feet and has a capacity of 400,000 gallons of water which is obtained from the Colne Valley water supply. The Pool is constructed of mass concrete and lined with glazed bricks. The water is filtered through Candy Pressure Filters and has a complete change every 4-J hours, the circulation being effected by 20 h.p. pump with a stand-by 15 h.p. pump. " Breakpoint" chlorination is effected and an average consumption of approximately 3 lbs. per hour of chlorine. The water is then neutralised by the addition of soda which gives an approximate pH factor of 7.5 which indicates slight alkalinity. The bathing load is approximately 1,500 and the basket room system of changing is in operation with cubicles surrounding the Pool. A Cafe is provided for refreshments and the catering let out to a Caterer on an annual basis. The Kingsbury Pool is situated in Roe Green Park in the Kingsbury Road and has a length of 55 yards and a width of 25 yards with a maximum depth of 10 feet. The capacity is 464,000 gallons but in this case there is a foot trough surrounding the Pool and also a Children's paddling pool. The water is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and is circulated through Permutit Pressure Filters and pumped by means of two 15 h.p. pumps and a complete change of water is effected every five hours. Chlorination is again on the " breakpoint" system and the same dosage and neutralisation arrangements. The Pool at Kingsbury is constructed of reinforced concrete and again is lined with glazed bricks. The capacity of this Pool for bathing is approximately 2,000, but there is a greater spectator area here than at Vale Farm. The basket room system is again in operation but in this case the changing accommodation cubicles are under the terraced seating. A Cafe is also provided at this Pool and catering is carried out by outside Caterers. 35 Samples of the water taken from the Pools and subjected to bacteriological examination, revealed the absence of B. Coli in all samples and proved the quality of the water to be beyond reproach. 7. SEWERAGE. The growth of the population in Wembley and the increase in domestic and other premises, was very considerable during the years 1930/1960, and the intervention of a period when few works could be undertaken on account of wartime conditions resulted in the Borough being behind-hand in the provision of adequate drainage, both for the surface water and for soil sewage. The Council were very conscious of this difficulty and an extensive programme of sewerage construction received their approval. Details of the relief schemes are included. Estimated Name. Type. Expenditure. Remarks. 1. Wealdstone Surface Water. £20,000 Completed 1963. Brook (Bridge Road, Improvement. River Brent). (M.C.C. Scheme). 2. Hale Lane. Surface Water. £10,000 Commenced 1963. 3.

The Rodent Control Service which is confined to dealing with infestations by rats and mice has continued to operate during the year under review. A staff of three " Ministry trained" assistants has performed the necessary work. No charge is made to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. 839 premises were satisfactorily treated by the Council. 9. PUBLIC CLEANSING. The Cleansing Maintenance and Transport Engineer has kindly supplied the following information:— Refuse Collection. House and Trade refuse is collected weekly, with the exception that refuse from certain blocks of flats is collected twice weekly. The amount of refuse collected during the year was 31,655 tons. The separate collection of waste paper from business premises has been maintained. The amount collected from this source during the year was 713 tons. Bulk collection of refuse has been introduced at certain premises. Refuse Disposal. Refuse is disposed of by a Separation and Incineration Plant which has handled 32,705 tons. Salvage materials amounting to 3,628 tons were sold for £16,836. Street Cleansing. Street sweeping is carried out by the use of pedestrian controlled electric trucks, together with in some cases individual street orderly trucks. Particular attention is given to shopping areas. Public Conveniences. Free washing facilities were available at the two staffed Conveniences in the Borough. 37 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

During the year your Medical Officers of the Department undertook the medical examinations of 62 actual or prospective staff and provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council on matters of medical importance. This service secures a medically sound personnel for all the activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual incidence of sickness, thereby saving expenditure and maintaining a standard of efficiency difficult in the absence of such a service. During the year the establishment of the Department remained near to full complement, with the consequence that individual officers could settle down to appointed duties without the need for relieving or substituting. This has made it possible to contain the burden of work which continues to be substantial and shows little sign of decreasing. I take the opportunity to express my contentment and satisfaction at the way in which members of the staff have performed their duties during this year, particularly on account of pressure of work but also in view of the not inconsiderable anxiety which many of them felt in relation to their personal position under the Reorganisation of Local Government in London. Finally, I should like to express my gratitude and thanks to all members of the Council, particularly to the members of the Health Committee, who have taken an interest in the work of the Department and assisted our endeavours towards the health of Wembley. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health. 53 Hendon Printing Works Limited 66, East Road, Burnt Oak Edgware, Middlesex Telephone: EDG. 6181
