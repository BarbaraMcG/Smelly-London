SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES AND SAINT JOHN, CLERKENWELL. 1871—2 Presented pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 18 & 19 Vict., cap. 120. MEMORANDUM. In some of the previous Reports it has been stated how the Collection of the Poor Rate came to devolve upon the Vestry, viz., by the operation of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1807, and the consequent abolition of the Board of Guardians or Governors of the Poor under the Local Act, in January, 1868. This question having, however, been again raised in 1871, Counsel's Opinion was taken thereon, by which it appeared that the operation of the above Act had transferred the Relief of the Poor to the Guardians constituted under the now Poor Law, but had not affected the powers and duties of the former Hoard as regards the Collection of the Poor Rate. The Vestry therefore, on the making of the next Rate for the Relief of the Poor, in November, 1871, handed over the collection of same to the local Guardians or Governors, whose meetings (which had ceased since January, 1808,) were revived for the purpose, and who will therefore account for the PoorRate in future. Such Poor Rates as were in collection by the Vestry at this time, it was doomed convenient and expedient should bo continued by them to the close, hence the annexed account of Poor Rates made previous to November, 1871.

To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I now do myself the honour of laying before you my 16th Annual Report upon the mortality and sanitary relations of the parish, being that for the year 1871. I shall preserve the same form, to allow the data to be readily compared with those of former years. The number of deaths which arose from all causes in 1871, was 1417. The average number of deaths for the last 10 years was 1563 ; hence the deaths were 146 less than the average. And the number of deaths in 1870 being 1473, the deaths in 1871 were 56 less than in the preceding year. In the subjoined table, the number of deaths occurring in each of the last 10 years is shown; and opposite are the number of births for the same years:— Deaths. Births 1862 1572 2287 1863 1509 2449 1864 1735 2224 1865 1613 2389 1866 1661 2434 1867 1497 2452 1868 1644 2478 1869 1512 2410 1870 1473 2415 1871 1417 2274 The births are thus 107 fewer than the average. The sub-districts in which the deaths and births occurred, were as follows:— Deaths. Births. Excess. St. James 479 649 170 Amwell 312 558 246 Pentonville 281 449 168 345 618 273 19 During each year, a certain number of the inhabitants of the parish die in General and Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums, situated in other parishes. The estimated number of these for the year is 150. The number of births being 2274, and the deaths 1417, the excess, or the natural increase of population, amounted to 857. In the preceding year, this amounted to 942. The number of deaths which arose from all the zymotic diseases in 1871 was 302; that for the preceding year being 354 ; thus there was a diminution of 52. The number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases in 1871 was 279; being a diminution of 41 from the number for the last year. The number and causes of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases during the last 10 years are exhibited in the following table:— Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Diarrhoea. Typhus In Hospital. Totals. 1862 1 76 133 53 42 70+9 375 1863 26 44 136 66 52 42+8 376 1864 7 73 94 71 87 46+9 378 1865 12 27 57 88 84 48+5 316 1866 6 42 59 95 93 47+4 342 1867 20 44 49 35 71 50 269 1868 4 58 106 69 112 45 394 1869 0 28 116 81 74 44 343 1870 6 63 122 19 70 40 320 1871 60 23 33 62 68 33 279 20 The average number of deaths from these diseases, during the last 10 years, was 339; so that the number for 1871 is 60 below the average. The number of deaths from all causes, in infants and children under 5 years of age, was 660 ; being less than in 1870, when the number was 711—a diminution of 51. The deaths occurring at and above 60 years were 260, including 44 at and above 80. The numbers for the preceding year were 279 and 44. 287 deaths arose from pulmonary diseases ; the number for the preceding year being 312. 75 deaths occurred in the Workhouse, 36 of males, 39 of females. The numbers for the preceding ten years, having been 160, 172, 158, 167, 174, 156, 186, 178, 140, and 107. The number of inmates was 352: 147 males, and 205 females; exclusive of 7 officials. 19 deaths took place in the Corporation Buildings; the numbers for the preceding 4 years having been 14, 26, 21, and 17. The inhabitants were 971; the death-rate per 1000 being 18. 24 deaths occurred in the House of Correction; the number for 1870 having been 27.3 deaths took place in the House of Detention. The accidental deaths were 26; the number for 1870 being 16.7 of these arose from fracturrs and contusions, 1 from a burn, and 18 from accidental suffocation (16 of these in infants.) 3 deaths, of infants, arose from murder. 7 deaths arose from suicide, viz.: 2 from poison, 3 from hanging, and 2 from precipitation from a height. 115 inquests were held in the year, including 27 upon deaths in the House of Correction and the House of Detention; being an increase of 24 upon the number for 1870, The Table appended to this Report, contains an enumeration of the deaths, according to the diseases and ages, in further detail. The mortality arising from all causes has thus been below the average of the last 10 years, and below that of the last year CENSUS. On April 3rd of the year 1871, the census was taken; so that we are enabled to compare the number of deaths with that of the population, or to determine the death-rate, with tolerablo accuracy. 21 The following are the results:— 1861. 1871. Population of whole Parish 65681 Inhabited Houses 7088 6808 Per house 9.2 9.6 Population of Sub-districts: St. James 19152 18917 Amwell 17250 16881 Pentonville 13079 13337 Goswell 16200 16212 The population of Clerkenwell, it may be stated, was in 1801, 23,396; in 1821, 39,105; in 1811, 56,756; and in 1851, 61,778. The relation of the population to acreage in 187L was found to be as follows Acres. Persons to Acre. St. James 73 259 203 Pentonville 133 100 Goswell 91 178 Hence we deduce the following facts. The population of the Parish has been diminished in the 10 years by 301 inhabitants; the number of houses has been reduced 280. The St. James sub-district has lost 235 inhabitants; the Amwell, 366; while the Pentonville and Goswell sub-districts have increased 258, and 42 respectively. The most crowded districts of the metropolis are Westminster (sub-district Berwick Street) where there are 429, Holborn (sub-district St. Andrews) where there are 410, and St. Luke's (sub-district Whitecross Street) where there are 418 persons to the acre. In 17 large towns in England the mortality per thousand has been determined by the Registrar-General to be as follows London, 21.7; Portsmouth, 19.3; Norwich, 25.9; Bristol, 23.2; Wolverhampton, 28.0; Birmingham, 24.9; Leicester, 26.8; Nottingham, 26; Liverpool, 35.1; Manchester, 31.2; Salford, 30.4; Bradford, 25.5; Leeds, 26.4; Sheffield, 28.3; Hull, 23.2; Sunderland, 36.5; and Newcastle-on-Tyne, 32.2—the average being 26.5. The sub-districts according to population per acre stand thus : St. James, Amwell, Goswell, and Pentonville. The deaths occurring in the Parish in 1871, were thus 21 per thousand ; that for the separate sub-districts being St. James 25, Amwell 18, Pentonville 21, and Goswell 21. 22 If the 150 deaths calculated as the share of Hospital deaths occurring in persons removed from this parish be added, the mortality becomes 23.0 per thousand : still below the average 1 the Metropolis (although greatly increased by the deaths from Small Pox). As above stated, a certain number of deaths of persons removed from the Parish, take place in General Hospitals, &c. The accurate apportioning of these to the several Parishes cannot be effected with certainty. The Registrar-General, in whose hands the details are, remarks that "the deaths recorded in Public Institutions form a most disturbing element in calculating local rates of mortality in the districts and sub-districts of London." We must, therefore, rest satisfied with this approximation. The death rate for the Metropolis in 1871, was 24.7 per thousand. Thus the year 1871 has been favorable in regard to its mortality; the deaths being considerably below the average of the last 10 years, below the number for any one of the last 10 years, below that for the preceding year, and below that of the Metropolis generally. The deaths arising from all the zymotic diseases were below that of the last year; as were also those arising from the principal zymotic diseases, which are so especially under the control of sanitary measures, (see table p. 19.) Hence the Resolution of the Vestry, dated Feb. 1st, 1872, (moved by Mr. G. Brooke, and seconded by Mr. H. J. Brown,) "That the sanitary condition of the Parish of Clerkenwell is in a most unsatisfactory condition, &c.," is not, as I stated in a Spicial Report (1872), founded on facts. The number of deaths from all the special zymotic diseases has been diminished, except that from Small Pox, 60 deaths from which occurred in the Parish in the year; and from Hooping Cough from which 62 deaths took place. Small Pox prevailed epidemically during the last quarter of 1870, both in this Parish and in the Metropolis; and during 1871, it continued to prevail in the Metropolis generally to an unparalleled extent, causing 7876 deaths; the numbers for the preceding 10 years having been 215, 345. 2012, 537, 646, 1388, 1332, 606, 273, and 958. Nearly 23,000 deaths were caused by it in all England. 318 cases were attended by the Parochial Medical Officers during the year. 23 The preventive efficacy of vaccination in staying the ravages of this terrible malady is so thoroughly established, that the sufferers must hold themselves responsible for their own neglect in not taking advantage of the protection at their command. Handbills have been posted and circulated by the Vestry yearly, pointing out this fact, and referring the public to vaccinators, who operate free of charges, so that the Vestry cannot be held responsible for the prevalence of this malady. At the same time, in every case brought to notice, special care has been taken that the rooms occupied by the patients were thoroughly disinfected. In many instances the beds have been burnt and replaced by new at the Parish expense. And in several cases where the family has been broken up by death, and the rooms re-occupied, after disinfection, I have carefully noticed that no infection to the new tenants has ever occurred. I believe that the vaccination is well looked after in the Parish; and no prosecution for neglect has been found necessary. The following experience of Dr. Grieve, in the Hampstead Hospital, is worth recording, in relation to the influence of vaccination upon Small Pox. Of 6221 patients admitted, 1218 were without vaccination marks; and of these 638 or 51.12 per cent, died; while of 4973 with vaccination marks, only 567 died —11.40 per cent. The general mortality was 19.36 per cent. The mortality in relation to the number of vaccination marks was as follows:-with 1 mark, the mortality was 17.39 per cent.; with 2, 12.17; with 3, 10.58; with 4, 8.38; and with 5 and mere, 6.43 per cent. And it was found, that after revaccination efficiently performed, any person might safely attend upon Small Pox patients, without fear of infection, much less of death. The experience of Dr. Collie, at the Homerton Small Pox Hospital, is worth recording also. "During the five months that Small Pox was treated in the Hospital, 110 persons were engaged in attendance upon the sick. All of these, with two exceptions, were re-vaccinated, and they all, with the exceptions referred to, although exposed to the infection in its most concentrated form, escaped the disease. The appointment of these persons had not been referred to the Medical Superintendent, and as a consequence they were not re-vaccinated, and they both contracted Small Pox." The same results have been reported in other Hospitals. 24 It may bo interesting to enumerate the inhabitants of the most crowded courts in 1861 as compared with the number for 1871. 1861. Inhabitants. 1871. Inhabitants. Albert Place 59 Aylesbury Place 136 135 Bishop's Court 226 220 Bitt Alley 81 89 Broad Court 158 93 Caroline Place 157 125 Eagle Place 50 38 Easton Place 85 Erying-pan Alley 86 75 Hallett's Place 123 Kemp Place 15 Lamb Court 108 19 „ Square 67 44 Ledbury Place 59 Providence Place 53 Rose Alley 125 92 Spa Cottages 160 Spencer Place 148 Union Place 25 It is evident that the number of inhabitants of these courts has been in most cases diminished. But I should be glad to see many of the courts demolished, if other suitable dwellings could be found for their occupants. The deaths from Hooping Cough experienced a considerable increase. This disease, which arises solely from infection, and is most fatal in cold weather, must always cause an increase of mortality from its mere prevalence; because it occurs mostly among infants, among which the mortality-rate is always high. The deaths from Scarlet Fever were very much below what they had been for many years. The deaths from Diarrhoea were fewer than in any of the preceding 10 years. Most of these deaths occur in infants, and arise really from improper feeding and want of breast milk, as I have so often stated in previous Reports. The deaths from Typhus were also below those of any of the last 10 years. DEATHS REGISTERED IN CLERKENWELL IN 1871.

Early in the year*, I directed the attention of the Vestry to the importance of furnishing this apparatus, with the view of destroying the infection of bedding clothing, &c. After several meetings of the Sanitary Committee a spot was selected, (in a rather crowded locality), the premises taken on lease, and one of Eraser's ovens was purchased at an expense of about £200, and erected. This was used with great benefit, and very numerous articles were disinfected by it, dry heat being used at a temperature of 250° Fahr. to 300°. But at the end of about three months, the inhabitants of the surrounding neighbourhood took alarm, and petitioned the ground landlord of the premises, who brought an action of ejectment; and on July 11 th, the resident worker of the oven with his family and goods, were turned into the street. Since that period, the oven has not been used, the disinfection having been effected by sulphuring in the infected apartments; old bedding, &c., having been burnt, and replaced by the Vestry at the Parish expense. It is to be hoped that this invaluable apparatus will be reinstated in some apparently less objectionable locality. But wherever it may be placed, it may be considered perfectly innocuous. Slaughter-houses. These were inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself, prior to the licensing. They were 33, kept by the same number of butchers. In 1870, the numbers were 36 in each case. The Slaughter-houses on the whole were in good order; but, as I have often pointed out, many of them are totally unfit for the purpose, although they have been in use many years. The clause in the Building Act, which will come into force in 1874, keeping them at a considerable distance from public ways and inhabited houses, will do good. The nuisance arising from the bellowing of calves will thus be prevented ; as well as the driving of cattle over footways. The conditions under which the Slaughter-houses are licensed are:—that no part of the premises used as a Slaughter-house shall be inhabited ; that the walls be properly lime-whited twice a-year; that the paving be laid in cement; that there be a properly constructed drain, with a suitable trap to prevent the animal matter from entering the drain ; that there be a proper water supply; with receptacles for holding the garbage until its removal; and that no accumulation of refuse be allowed upon the premises. * In my first Annual Report, for 1856, p. 28, I recommended the Vestry "to provide some suitable form of bakehouse for purifying articles of clothing, adding, &c." 26 Cow-houses. There were 31 in number, kept by 26 Cow- keepers, the number of cows being 367. In 1870, the numbers were 33, 30, and 452; so that there were 85 cows fewer than in that year. The same remarks apply to the Cow-houses as to the Slaughter-houses: that many of them are mere makeshifts, and not sufficiently ventilated. Still, the cows were healthy, no cases of the diseases so prevalent in the provinces existing in any of them. The conditions required for the licensing of the Cow-houses are:—that they be properly lighted and ventilated; that they and the adjoining yards be properly paved and drained; that there be a proper supply of water; a properly constructed dungpit—level with the surface; and that the grain bins be kept clean and in good repair; that the Cow houses be cleaned twice, and the yards once a-day; that the dung be swept up twice aday, and removed three times a-week before 8 a.m.; and that they be lime-whited at least twice every year. (The license for one Cow-house in another parish was refused, because the dung was removed at 11 a.m., causing a nuisance to the neighbouring inhabitants.) Wherever Cow-houses are kept in the Metropolis, there must be a nuisance arising from the effluvia evolved by the decomposing dung and fermenting grains. But if the above regulations are properly carried out, the nuisance will be reduced to a minimum. Artizans' Dwellings Act. The Turamill Street Courts, which 1 condemned under this Act, are still under the consideration of the Vestry. They will be pulled down shortly, to make room for the new street. Six of the houses in Frying-pan Alley have been pulled down; 4 being re-built in their place, and provided with separate closets, &c. Workshops Regulation Act.—Theduties of the Vestry in regard to this Act, so far as concerns the persons employed, and the hours during which they are engaged, have been transferred by the Act to the Inspector of Factories. In so far as they relate to nuisances, the supervision remains with the Vestry. Wo occasion has been found for interference in these cases. 27 The meteorology of the year was as follows:— 1871. Temperature, Average. Difference from Average of 100 years- Dew-point. Humidity (Saturition=100.) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from average of 56 years. Year 48.7 —0.1 42.7 81 29.79 22.5 —2.7 Winter Quarter (Jan. Feb. Mar. 40.2 +1.6 35.5 84 29.78 4.3 —0.7 Spring Quarter (April, May, June) 51.5 — 0.8 44.9 78 29.77 6.7 +1.1 Summer Quarter (July, Aug.

Nov, Dec.) 41.8 —1.9 37.8 86 29.84 3.2 —4.0 Hence the mean temperature of the year was slightly below the average; that of the winter and summer being above, and that of the spring and autumn being below the average. The rainfall during the year was somewhat below the average; but not so much so, as in the previous year. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. W.
