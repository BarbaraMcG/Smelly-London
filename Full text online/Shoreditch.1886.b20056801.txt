Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1887, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £58,429 15s. 11d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four Quarters was 2s. 0d., being for the Quarter to Midsummer, 6d.; to Miohaelmas, 6d.; to Christmas, 6d.; and to Lady-day, 6d. During the previous year the Poor Pate was 2s. 5d. Tho amount of the Guardians' calls for the year ending Ladyday, 1886, was £60,200 ; and for the last year, £41,660 ; and for the Half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1887, is £25,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1887, was nil. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Pates will be found in the Balance Sheets, as audited and signed. SEWERS AND GENERAL PATES. The statement hereto appended will give the details of the Receipts and Expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Pates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last year were— s. d. General—in the £ 2 1 Sewers ditto 0 8 2 9 The total amount collected on the Vestry Pates for the year was £80,319 19s. 10d., an increase upon the previous year of £1,542 15s. 8d. 8 Of these sums collected by the Vestry as for Poor Rates, large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposes over which the Vestry has no control. Thus, in addition to the £41,660 paid to the Guardians, out of which the County Rate and Metropolitan Asylum's Board's charges are paid, there is a sum of £13,127 16s 10d. paid to the Commissioners of Metropolitan Police, and £693 16s. Od. for Registration, &c., expenses. From the Sewers Rate is paid the Metropolitan Board's Consolidated Rate of £16,288 5s. 8d. From the General Rate is paid the School Board Rate of £23,825 18s. 5d., and the Toll Bridges Precept of £2,458 19s. 9d. All these charges are based upon the rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses, nor for the allowance to owners. ASSESSMENT. The valuation of the Parish for Assessment purposes, for the year beginning the 5th of April, 1887, is as follows :— April, 1886. April, 1887. Increase. Gross value £790,080. £790,308. £228. Rateable value . 642,329. 642,380. 51. The increase at the last Quinquennial valuation was £71,466 and £56,054 respectively. It will be seen that very little addition was made during the last year, and as there is evidence of a general fall of rents throughout the Parish it is not improbable that next year's figures will show a decrease. The number of Assessments and the Rateable Value of each Ward, omitting such of the Gas, Water, Railway and other Assessments, as are included in several Wards, are as follows:— Number of Assessments. Rateable Value. Moorficlds Ward 1,393 91,944 Church Ward, North 2,006 64,644 Church Ward, South 1,242 67,471 Hoxton Ward 2,425 77,647 Wenlock Ward 1,801 59,741 9  Number of Assessments. Rateable Value. Whitmore Ward, 2,323 55,457 Kingsland Wird 1,740 44,555 Haggerstone Ward 1,635 35,111 Acton Ward 1,760 40,578 The Rateable Value of the Parish is made up as follows:— Railways £63,034 Gas Company 30,275 Water Companies 7,741 Tramway Company 2,960 Regent's Canal Company 738 Board Schools 11,929 Hoxton House Asylum 1,063 Theatres and Taverns attached thereto 1,571 The Town Hall 1,000 Other Assessments of £500 and upwards, including Model Dwellings of that value 22,203 The "Workhouse and Infirmary belonging to the Holborn Union in the City Road, is by Local Act rated at £19 only. The Shoreditch Workhouse and Infirmary is not Assessed. The total of the above is £142,514, which shows that the ordinary Assessments, under £500, amount to £499,866. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 107 times; the Council Chamber 7 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by Local Societies, mostly free of charge. The receipts for letting Hall, Council Chamber and Committee Rooms were £688 14s. 6d. 10 VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The number of Vestry and Committee Meetings hold during tho year ended 1st May, 1887, is as follows:— Number of Vestry Meetings 40 Finance Committee (including Meetings of Audit Committee) 46 Sewers, &c., Committee 27 General Purposes Committee 21 Valuation Committee, including Sub-Committee 4 Town Hall Committee ditto 16 Parliamentary and Improvement Committee 8 Total 162 TRAMWAYS AND LOCAL UNDERTAKINGS. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company promoted in the Session of 1880 a Bill to extend their existing lines from Groat Eastern Street to Whitechapel, and from the western terminus at Gray's Inn Road to Holborn and to Oxford Street. The Bill passed the Commons, but its progress in the Lords was stayed by the dissolution until the Session of 1887, when with certain modifications as regards the western extension, it passed. The Holborn and Bloomsbury lines have been constructed, and it is probable that the Whitechapel extension will shortly bo proceeded with. THE GREAT EASTER N RIALWAY. The Great Eastern Railway promoted a Bill in the present Session which, so far as this Parish and District is connerned, sought to obtain additional lands in Bishopsgate Street and Norton Eolgato on the Eastern side for widening of the line and stations, which would interfere with the Shoroditoh 1 ligh Street and Worship Street, and also to obtain Parliamentary powers for tho earrying on ol" the Bishopsgate Market, under the Goods Stations in Shoroditoh and Stratford Market. The Vestry opposed the Bill with a view to obtain protection against undue interfernnee with the streets, sewers, &e., and also as to rating clauses. These 11 matters were satisfactorily arranged between the Promoters, the Vestry, and the Metropolitan Board, without the expense of an appearance by Counsel before the Committee. As to the Market Clauses, the Vestry finding that as the price of the privilege of opening and continuing these markets a toll was to be levied upon all produce brought into either market for the benefit of the owner of Spitalfieds Market, considered this arrangement as contrary to public policy, and injurious to the inhabitants of Shoreditch and its vicinity, and therefore determined to petition against this part of the Bill. The Vestry's petition in this respect was objected to, and as the Vestry was not an authority possessed of market rights, it was not pressed. The Market Clauses were however vigorously opposed by the Corporations of London and West Ham, and by the owners and salesmen of Columbia Market. The result was that the Committee of the House of Commons struck out all clauses relating to the compensation to the owner of Spitalfields Market, and so conferring independent market rights upon the Great Eastern Railway Company; but the opposition by the above named parties being continued in the House of Lords, the Committee of that House struck out the Market Clauses altogether, leaving the Company (so far as the legal judgements obtained by the owners and lessee of Spitalfields Market and the Great Eastern Railway go) at the mercy of the owners of Spitalfields market. COLUMBIA MARKET RAILWAY EXTENSION. The North London Railway Company have made some progress towards this undertaking by clearing the ground for the extension, but the Columbia Market owners have as yet done nothing in the way of actual works. How far they may have proceeded in the aquisition of the property requisite I am unable to say. I have reason to believe that the decision of the House of Lords in the matter of the Great Eastern Railway Market may facilitate the progress of this undertaking. REGENTS CANAL RAILWAY. This Company has obtained during the present Session an extension of time of three years for acquisition of property and five years for completion. 12 WIDENING OF PLOUGH YARD. The widening of this thoroughfare, for which the London and North Western Railway Company some four years ago obtained powers, has not yet been commenced. No other schemes of special social importance have been submitted for Parliamentary sanction this session. WATER COMPANYS' REGULATION ACT. A Bill is now before Parliament, which has for its object the restriction of the Water Companies from cutting off the Water from small dwellings for non-payment of Water rates, where the owner and not the occupier is liable by law or agreement to the payment of the rate. As there are very few cases where the owner is liable by law, and as there is nothing to compel the Water Company to enter into an agreement, very little good can be anticipated from the operation of this Bill if it should pass.* NILE STREET IMPROVEMENT. The last Annual Report gave an account of the proceedings which had been taken in conjunction with the Charity Trustees of St. Luke and Cripplegate, for the opening of the thoroughfare between East Road and Shepherdess Walk, which was restricted to very narrow dimensions on one part, by property partly belonging to the above Trustees and partly by private owners. It was then stated that although the works were completed the accounts wore not finally adjusted, and the complete statement as to cost, &c., must be deferred till next year. The statement of the final settlement is now presented. The land belonging to the Charity Trustees of St. Luke and Cripplegate was, after considerable correspondence, in which the Vestry absolutely declined to purchase, given up free of cost, on condition that the Vestry put in the sewer and paved the thoroughfare. in the sewer and paved the thoroughfare. For the remaining property required, the Vestry paid :— * Received Royal Assent, 8th August. 13 For the freehold £100 0 0 Surveyor and Solicitor's costs 19 19 0 119 19 0 For the Leaseholder and Tenant with costs 563 13 0 Vestry's costs—Surveyor and Solicitors 29 11 2 713 3 2 Less sale of old materials 7 0 0 Total cost £705 3 2 The Works cost as follows:— Sewerage £51 0 4 Carriageway paving 346 15 9 Footway do. 123 4 0 £521 0 9 Towards the cost of this Improvement, the Metropolitan Board contributed £320. HACKNEY ROAD IMPROVEMENT. The rebuilding of certain houses, No. 19, 23, Hackney Road, offered an opportunity to widen the footway of Hackney Road on the West side. The sum of £200 was paid for the freeholders interest, and £10 10s. vendor's Surveyor's costs, and £7 7s. Vestry Surveyor's costs. Towards the cost of this improvement, the Metropolitan Board contributed £100. APPOLD STREET IMPROVEMENT. An elaborate statement of accounts relating to the above improvement, which was commenced in 1887, and carried out at the joint expense of the Vestry and the Metropolitan Board, was received in January last and examined by the Finance Committee. The summary of this statement is that the total nett cost of the improvement was £85,972 19s. 6d., the share payable by the Vestry being one moiety, or £42,986 9s. 9d. The Vestry contributed £65,000 which was advanced by loan by the Metropolitan 14 Board, and there has been credited to the Vestry as its share of rents, interest, &c., £2,883 19s. 7d., making the Vestry's contribution £67,883 19s. 7d. The Board has returned to the Vestry by writing off the loan of £65,000 £24,897 9s. 10d., leaving tho nett cost to tho Vestry as above stated £42,986 9s. 9d. In the form of a Balance Sheet it would stand thus:— £ H. d. £ s. d. Nett cost to Vestry 42,986 9 9 Contributions by Vestry and charged to Vestry as Loans 65,000 0 0 Writton off Loans and Credited to Vestry 24,897 9 10 Share of Rents and Interests credited to Vestry 2,883 19 7 .£67,88: 19 7 £67,883 19 7 Of the £65,000 taken by the Vestry on loan £40,000 was taken up in 1887 for 52 years at 3¾ per cent., and £15,000 in 1878 for 51 years at the same rate. The first instalment of £12,952 was returned in 1882, the second of £4,982 in 1883, the third of £5,985 in 1884, and the last of £978 9s. 10d. in 1887. The average annual repayments of the loans, including principal and interest, in respeet to this improvement spread over 52 years, will be about £1700. As the rateable value of the properties now existing, is in excess over those removed by upwards of £3,500, and as the paving and sewering are included in the cost, it will bo seen that the improvement has been affected at little cost to the ratepayers. DISORDERLY HOUSES, &c. Several places of improper character have been suppressed by indictment, and others have been dealt with summarily. In some cases the parties have quitted on notice without prosecution. Appended are various Tables showing Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities, Loans Outstanding, Analyst's Reports, List of Contracts, &c., &c.

The following quantities of material were supplied by the Contractors at the cost stated, and used on the macadam and ballast roads in the Parish during the year :— £ s. d. 837½ yards cube Broken Granite 621 2 11 298½ „ „ Flints 97 0 3 50 „ ,, Ballast 16 5 0 793¼ ,, ,, Hoggin 257 16 1 The Contractor for broken granite, supplied by tender, and delivered in January last, about 50 tons of granite spalls, costing £44 4s. 3d., to be broken up by any "unemployed" men seeking work. As no applications were received the material remains in stock. During the year 410¼ cubic yards of old pebbles, York, etc., were broken up, costing £51 5s. 7½d., and loaded and carted for repairing the roads at a further cost of about £51 5s. 7½d. Forty-one "unemployed" men, taken on during the week ending March 26th, 1886, broke up about 44¼ cubic yards of old granite cubes, &c., at a cost of £5 10s. 7d. in wages. 46 One foreman and six laborers on average were employed in the yard, and on the general repairs of the unpaved roads and over trenches opened by the Gas and Water Companies; their wages for the year amounted to £381 17s. 1½d. The sum of 15s. was also paid for Watchmen's wages. The Companies contributed £86 13s. 4½d. for labour (exclusive of Foreman's time) and £175 16s. 8½d. for material required in the said repairs. In Consequence of the use of the Steam Roller the unpaved roads are, generally speaking, in a satisfactory condition. STEAM ROAD ROLLER. The Roller was at work 254 days during the past year, and about 14 men on average, under the superintendance of a foreman, were employed in scoring, rolling, sweeping and watching the highways; the amount expended in labour was £922 1s. 5d.

Gentlemen, 4,692 births— 2.338 males and 2,354 females ; and 2,961 deaths were registered in the twelve months ending 25th March, 1887. Deducting the deaths of non-residents, the rate of mortality was 19.06 per 1,000 living, being 2"36 per 1,000 below the average of the last five years. The largest number of deaths was registered in Haggerston district, in which is situated Shoreditch Infirmary. The following statistics show the rate of mortality in the different Registration Districts of the Parish :— Population. Deaths. Average per 1000 living. Holywell 7,376 146 19.80 St. Leonard 14,967 239 15.90 Hoxton New Town 29,937 499 16.60 Hoxton Old Town 28,036 478 17.04 Haggerston 46,275 1,134 24.50 425 deaths occurred in the public institutions of the parish, viz.:—297 in Shoreditch Infirmary, 292 in Holborn Infirmary (situate in Hoxton New Town), 72 in the North Eastern Hospital, and 56 in Hoxton House. 78 Disoases aeknowlodged to bo induced by cold and damp wore very destructive. Thoro were 314 deaths from bronchitis, 259 from phthisis, and 160 from pneumonia, making a total of 739 deaths registered under the above headings. 819 deaths occurred under one yoar of age—against 910 in the previous year. The deal lis under live years of ago have decreased— 970 against 1499 in the previous yoar. 351 deaths ocourred of persons 65 years and upwards, viz. :—215 from 65 to 75 ; 112 from 75 to 85 ; 23 from 85 to 95; and one at 96. In tho provious year 274 persons died between 65 and 75 years of age; 120 from 75 to 85, and 30 from 85 to 95 In childhood (from 1 to 5 years), tho largest number of deaths was caused by lung disease 293, comprising 146 from bronchitis, 74 from pneumonia, and 73 from congestion of lungs, &c. The diseases which camo next in ordor of fatality were atrophy and debility (132 deaths); convulsions 89; whooping cough 47; premature birth 48, and diarrhoea 167. From the age of 55 and upwards, 138 deaths were caused by bronchitis; 61 by heart disease, and 17 by paralysis; 123 were registered under the term of "old age." ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 423 deaths, vi£:-26 by scarlet fever; 20 by ontorio fever; 20 by diphtheria; 75 by moaslos; 48 by whooping cough; 172 by diarrhoea, and 62 by othor zymotic diseasos. 17 of tho 47 deaths from whooping cough occurred in infants under one year of age. Tho intluoneo of age is manifest,—II of tho 47 deaths from whooping cough wore in infants under two years of ago, and 162 of the 172 deaths from diarrhooa occurred in infants under two years of ago. DISINFECTION.—To arrest tho spread of contagious diseases 506 houses were disinfected; the infected rooms fumigated by sulphur, and subsequently tho windows kept open to expose the rooms freely to tho oxydising influences of the open air. Tho walls of tho room, whore neoessary, wore stripped and otherwise cleansed. 79 At the disinfecting oven 3782 articles were disinfected. The Sanitary Officer, Inspector Lear, reports that he has been able to secure the removal of 271 of the infected sick to the Asylums, and that speaking generally, he has experienced little difficulty in inducing these persons to the removal. Inspector Alexander reports that 1210 premises were carefully inspected, and in 1075, nuisances dangerous to health were found, and consequently notices served requiring their abatement. His report further gives an account in detail of the various works that have been done to abate the nuisances ; and it may be gathered that much has been accomplished in the year to render the dwellings more suitable for health. Some of the alterations were structural, for instance to remove damp, 246 roofs were repaired. Some alterations were needed to carry away sewage products and for that purpose 425 drains were repaired or replaced. Cesspools have mostly been abolished, but occasionally they are yet found ; but only 9 were discovered in the year. A great deal of attention has been given for some years past to securing the inhabitants better closet accommodation ; improved structures and more cleanliness by increased water supply--445 closets were cleansed and repaired, and water supply restored, or newly laid on in 594 closets. Moreover additional care has been bestowed, in endeavouring to prevent sewage gases penetrating the basement rooms and sleeping chambers, therefore in 306 premises, waste pipes had to be securely trapped, or their continuous connection with the drain cut off. Rain pipes have also been disconnected from drains in 421 premises. Much work was done also in paving yards to keep the earth under, and by the side of the dwellings dry and sweeter; the dryness is indispensable for freshness, to enable air to circulate through the surface earth, and disinfect by oxidation any organic products that might accummulate, and become poisonous. A small group of houses, the name of which is well-known to the Sanitary Authorities of the Parish; that is Reform Place, have been closed as unfit for habitation, and demolished. These old dwellings your Medical Officer had on several occasions brought 80 under the notice of the Vestry, as houses unfit for human beings to live in. Representations were made to the owner, and he spent much money in endeavouring to improve them, but judging from the short time that the improvement lasted, it seemed a waste of money and labor, and very little benefit to the inhabitants. The rooms were too small without any through ventilation, and the ventilators inserted by the orders of the Sanitary Authority, some years ago, only made them unbearably and dangerously draughty, so that the inmates had to block them up, and they had no back yards, and no back windows. Inspector Alexander further gives particulars of a large public school, in the premises of which the drains were constructed in a very dangerous manner. This was evident when I visited the premises, and the occurrence of infectious disease on the premises afforded undeniable testimony. The original construction was dangerous, to say the least; it had been assumed that the joints and arrangements of pipes would be and continue impervious, so that sewage gas could not escape. It was overlooked that more or less vibration there must be through buildings, and the joints and cement become loosened, and gases escape into enclosures, and into the school-room until they became poisonous and dangerous. Traps and joints are conveniences resorted to, to economise space, but they are in all cases exceedingly liable to become defective, and that should be more recognised, and not assumed that they are at all times impervious to gaseous matters. I have again to report that much time and intelligence has been afforded to secure the work in the sanitary alterations being better done, and more suitable materials used ; and the additional confidence manifested by owners of dwellings show that they appreciate the Inspector's supervision. It is needless to add that anything promoting health is more economical, and however much unsound work and inferior material made be hidden away, yet the elements, air, water, &c. are so, 81 sound in their own working, that the defects are sure to be revealed sooner or later ; and in the end making an enemy of the employer of labor, and wrongfully discouraging those who are toiling to maintain the interests of skilful workmanship. CONSTANT WATER SUPPLY has continued to work satisfactorily, and year by year more inhabitants are given for domestic purposes, direct supply from the Company's pipes. Last year, in 180 premises, water was supplied direct from mains in lieu of cistern. THE SEWERS.—Your Medical Officer has been compelled by the complaints of the inhabitants to call the attention of the Sanitary Committee, to the nuisances injurious to health, arising from the defects of the sewers, and whilst some temporary improvements have been effected, yet there is much need of some great alteration in the arrangement and construction of the sewers. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. G. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health. 83 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. ST. LEONARD, SHOREDITCH. Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present the following report on the Sanitary work done under ray superintendence during the year ended 25th March, 1887, showing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement. House to house visitation, and special inspection with reference to complaints made in 1210 premises Notices served requiring the abatement of nuisances injurious to health in 1075 premises WORKS DONE TO SECURE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.

MISCELLANEOUS. Overorowding abated in 19 premises Dead bodies removed from 8 „ Animals, kept so as to be a nuisance, removed from 7 ,, Accumulation of dung and rubbish removed from 31 „ Smoke Nuisances abated in 9 ,, Making a total of 5,652 separate nuisances, dangerous to health, abated in 1,075 dwellings. In addition to the ordinary notices served for the abatement of nuisances, 511 letters have been written. To show the character of the work done during the year a few cases are given in detail, as follows:— MINTERN STREET SCHOOLS, CHAPEL, etc.— These are extensive premises, the playground of which is enenclosed on the West by the Chapel, Yestry, and the Caretaker's house,—on the East by the schoolrooms,—on the South by the water closets, and urinals; and on the North or Mintern Street side—by the Schoolmaster's house ; and they were drained by three main drains connected with the sewer in Mintern Street. Several cases of fever having occurred in the family of the Caretaker led to an investigation, and to the discovery of the following conditions of drainage, and the history of its construction. In building the Chapel a large brick drain (No. 1) was constructed external to the east end wall, subsequently a Yestry, Classrooms, and a Caretaker's house were built contiguous to the Chapel, and on the ground above No. 1 drain, later on the Schools, and the Master's house were built, and also the closets and urinal at the rear of playground. For these premises a pipe drain (No. 2) was constructed extending from the closets through the playground, and 86 under the Master's house to the sewer in Mintern Street. Into No. 2 drain, in addition to closets and urinals, seventeen rain water pipes and gullies in the playground, and the kitchen sink in the Master's house were directly connected. Some years afterwards, complaints having been made of bad smells arising in the Master's house and several cases of fever having occurred therein, it was then determined to construct another pipe drain (No. 3) to be used exclusively for drainage of water closets and urinals. Nos. 1 & 2 drains to be reserved for surface drainage only. On inspection, these three main drains, and a network of branch drains spreading from them, under the playground, under floor of school rooms, Master's house, and Chapel Yestry, were all found to be in a most dangerously defective condition, of which the following are instances:— Six of the branch drains which extended from one side of the schoolroom to the other were so carelessly jointed as to leave no doubt of tho free escape of sewer gas. In the schoolrooms, and attached to the back wall, were six rain pipes carried up from these drains to the roof. Several of the joints of these rain pipes were defective, and must also have allowed sewer gas to escape freely, one especially, a new pipe, was fixed only a few weeks before inspection was made—in the most careless manner. Where the lower end of this pipe was fitted into a socket, no care had been taken to seal the socket, so as to prevent sewer gas escaping. This left a free opening of ^in. all around the pipe for the emission of sewer gas,—and this was on a level with the heads of children in a schoolroom. The water closet in the Master's house, which was re-constructc-d when the drain No. 3 was formed, was connected to drain as follows: — The trap of the pan was not fitted into a drain pipe, but merely into a rough cavity formed of pieces of brick set in cement. This contrivance had naturally caused a stoppage. The same person who created the cause was employed to remove the effect; and this was done by simply knocking a hole in the top of the trap. It was probably argued that the stoppage would 87 recur; and that in such case the hole, if left open, would obviate trouble. Whether argument arose or not, a large hole made in the top of the trap was left entirely uncovered, through which sewer gas must have flowed into the house. The drain extending from the brick and cement cavity under trap of pan and connected into No. 3 drain was formed of five 4" drain pipes, these were laid zigzag. The bad joints thus occasioned were carefully sealed with cement on the top only. The under part was left open with the result that sewage escaped and soddened the course of the drain. By the courtesy of one of the Trustees, the whole of the arrangements described are deposited at the Town Hall, and in the condition in which they were found, in evidence of the disastrous work, even now, being done from day to day by incompetent tradesmen, when not under proper supervision. This case is noteworthy not only for the evidence it supplies as to the fact that persons, however incompetent and inexperienced may engage in the work of drain laying, but also for the evidenoe supplied that persons with insufficient experience or qualification may, for years engage in directing the alteration and construction of drains upon which the health of large numbers of persons may depend. Witness the defect of judgment and want of knowledge that suggested the construction of No. 3 drain as a corrective to the defects of No. 2. Water closets and urinals were to be shut off and No. 2 thereby rendered innocuous; as a matter of fact— though sewage was diverted into a new drain (No. 3), sewer gas must have continued to escape from the old one (No. 2) which should have been properly reconstructed and would then have been sufficient for the safe drainage of the whole of the premises. These views having been enforced upon the Trustees by notice and by personal interview, I received the thanks of the Committee and the assurance that the whole of my recommendations would be carried out. This has been done, Nos. 1 & 2 drains have been abolished and their connection with the sewer out off. No. 3 drain has been fitted with an inspection chamber in which the drainage of the premises is reoeived, including all the roofs, all surface drainage, water 88 closets and urinals, and is then discharged through an interception trap into the sewer. There is thus actually only one connection with the sower and that one trapped. These extensive alterations have occupied much of ray time, and they have been effected in the most satisfactory manner. 24 to 34, DE BEAUVOIR CRESCENT. Those are six roomed houses, the lower hack rooms of which wore dark and unfit for habitation being enclosed by wash houses covering the full width of yards. The wash-houses also enclosed the water closets and sinks, practically within the houses—and they were of the most filthy and injurious description. The owner, acting on my recommendation, has largely and beneficially altered the back promises throughout. The drains were relaid, the wash-houses and water-closets have been reconstructed leaving an open yard abutting on the houses and giving light and air to the lower back rooms. The water-closets built in the open air are of my improved design, fitted with concrete floors and with open space under seats. The yards on the level of ground floor have boon extended, well paved and drained and fitted with broad concrete stops rising three feet to the level of the rear part of the yards. Those alterations have effected a groat improvement on the squalid conditions before existing. SIMMONDS' SHOT FACTORY, APPOLD STREET. On the ground floor of those promises there was a largo number of furnaces and machines employed in the production of shot for "Nordenfelt Guns." The hardening of the finished shot was effected by dipping it while red hot into oil. The fumes arising from this operation wore very offensive and they wore drawn by a Bailey's ejector to the front of the promises and then discharged into the street. Many persons living and working in the neighbourhood complained of this as occasioning nausea. The work being of a temporary character, the proprietor, acting on my 89 ation, fitted the Bailey's ejector with a temporary but an efficient iron flue, which is attached to the outer wall; it is carried up above the roof of the premises, and has effectually removed all cause of oomplaint. HOUSES UNFIT FOR HABITATION—Nos. 5 to 12, REFORM PLACE. These houses had repeatedly been under sanitary notice, and much effort was made by the Leaseholder from time to time to keep the houses fit for habitation. The houses having reverted to the freeholder some time back, and having since then been allowed to fall into a state of dilapidation, which, added to original structural defects, rendered them unfit for habitation. Notice was therefore served on the owner, requiring the houses to be closed. This was done and they are now demolished. CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. ARTICLES DISINFECTED AT VESTRY'S OVEN.
