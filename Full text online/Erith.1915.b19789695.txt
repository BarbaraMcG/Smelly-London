Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Annual Report for the year 1915 in accordance with the Regulations of the Local Government Board. Owing to the absence of your Medical Officer of Health, Dr. A. E. Jerman, on military duty in connection with the war, I have been asked to act as his deputy in the sanitary part of his work, and though I have given much time from my own private duties, it may be excused that this report is not so full as that of your regular Medical Officer of Health. The School Work. Examinations of children, as well as attendance of patients at the Sanatorium, have been apportioned to other medical men in the district. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, L.J. J. BARNES. Annual Report for 1915. A.—Natural and Social Conditions of the District. (1) Physical Features and General Character of the District. The Urban District of Erith is situated on the south bank of the River Thames, immediately outside the County of London, which forms the western boundary; on the eastern side is the parish of Crayford, and south of it is the Urban District of Bexley. The District is one of the towns included in the "Outer Ring," which makes up " Greater London." The northern portion of the District, which lies between the River Thames and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway line, is 1,689 acres in extent, and consists of marsh land, the level of which varies generally between 3 and 7 feet above ordnance datum, and is below that of high water in the river. The remainder of the District rises gradually towards the south to a height of approximately 200 feet above sea level. (2) Population. At the Census of 1911 the population was found to be 27,750, made up of 14,143 males and 13,607 females. The number of inhabited buildings was 5,129, and the number of separate occupiers, 5,897. The average number of persons per inhabited building was 5.41, as compared with 4.85 for all Urban Districts (excluding London, and the County Boroughs) and 5.05 for the whole of England and Wales. The average number of persons per family was 4.71 for all dwellings, and 4.65 for ordinary dwelling-houses, as compared with 4.55 and 4.43 for all Urban Districts, and 4.51 and 4.38 for the whole of England and Wales. The number of vessels lying in the River Thames in the District at the date of the Census was 30, with 153 inhabitants, and the number of persons enumerated in tents, vans, sheds, etc., was 100, viz. : 51 males and 49 females, occupying 23 such erections. The following table is taken from Vol. VI. of the Census Returns for 1911, and shows the number of buildings in the District, kind of buildings, and the number of inhabitants:— 6  1901. 1911.

All houses were fully occupied and in many cases somewhat overcrowdd. Large private houses that had long stood 8 empty were quite filled. And after consultation with the Registrar General it was arranged to adopt an estimate of 35.232 as compared with 30.562 for 1914. This number is therefore used for the purpose of giving rates, etc., and would give an average of about 6.3 per house. The majority of the population in the district are employed at one or other of the Factories established here; these comprise factories in which are carried on : cable making, gun making, oil refining, manufacture of mining and other machinery, and manufacture of asbestos and cement slates and slabs. A small number are engaged in agricultural and horticultural pursuits. B.—Sanitary Circumstances of the District. (1) Water Supply. This is obtained from the Metropolitan Water Board. The water is very, hard, but otherwise of good quality, and the supply is ample for the requirements of the district. (2) Drainage and Sewerage. The main portion of the sewage of the District is carried by a sewer which was completed and opened in 1898. This sewer consists of two portions; one taking the sewage from the low-lying part of the District, and running from the western boundary near Abbey Wood Railway Station to Erith. This portion is worked by the Shone Pneumatic System, the ejectors being situated about every half mile throughout its length, and being worked by compressed air from the Outfall Works at Anchor Bay. The remaining portion of the sewer brings the sewage from the upper part of Belvedere and from Northumberland Heath; no ejectors are required on this section, as the fall is sufficient to maintain a good flow and keep the sewer clean. The Sewage Outfall Works are situated at Anchor Bay, at the eastern end of the District, and here the sewage is treated by means of septic tanks, aeration beds and percolating filters, the effluent being discharged into the River Thames. 9 There are 4 contact beds and 5 percolating filters with revolving distributors, and during the year an additional one has been commenced, and is now approaching completion. The plant at the Works consists of:— 1 50 h.p. gas engine, working air compressors. 2 45 h.p. electrically driven air compressors. 2 6in. and 1 4in. electrically driven centrifugal pumps for lifting the effluent from the septic tank to the filters. 1 4in. electrically driven portable pump for lifting sludge to lagoons constructed on new land. and "Pressure" gas producing plant in duplicate for working the gas engine. The Port of London Authority periodically take samples of the effluent from these Works for the purpose of Analysis; but for many years past there has been no complaint made as to the quality of the effluent discharged into the River Thames. There are still a few houses in Erith connected to an old brick sewer, which discharges direct into the River Thames. As opportunity arises, these houses are gradually being disconnected from this old sewer, and after reconstruction of the drainage, connected to the new sewer; 11 houses were so connected during 1915. There are a number of houses situated on the Marshes where no sewer is available for their drainage, and these are, in the majority of cases, drained into cesspools. At the upper portion of Abbey Wood there are also a number of houses drained into cesspools owing to there being no sewer available. All these cesspools are emptied by the Council when necessary, on notice of the same being given by the tenant of the house. During the winter and wet weather the cesspools on the Marshes are a constant source of trouble and nuisance. Not only does the condition of the Marshes render it extremely difficult, and sometimes almost impossible for the cesspool emptying vans to reach thos spots where the cesspool matter may be deposited, but in many cases the cesspools are not water-tight, and when the marsh ground is waterlogged, the cesspools, after being emptied, rapidly fill again with marsh water through the cracks in the sides and bottoms of the cesspools. 10 During the year 7 houses were re-drained and connected to the new sewer, which before then had been drained into cesspools. (3) Closet Accommodation. The large majority of houses in the District are provided with water-closets of the wash-down type, the sewage passing either to the sewer or cespools. Eight houses in the District are provided with earth closets, six of these being on the Marshes, the other two being so situated that it was impossible to construct water-closets and connect them to the main sewer owing to the difference in level. Some of the larger factories situated on the Marshes have a system of earth closets, and most of the smaller ones are simlarly provided. (4) Scavenging. House refuse is collected by the Council throughout the District twice a week. The Council's by-laws require that occupiers should place the refuse in proper sanitary dustbins, with covers, either on the kerb or in the forecourts of the houses, or in cases where there in at the backs of the houses a passage-way sufficiently wide to admit a cart, the receptacle may be placed near the door in the garden leading into the passage. The refuse is deposited on various shoots at Anchor Bay and on the Marshes, there being no dust destructor. A man is employed on these shoots to collect and burn all refuse which can be consumed in this manner, such as paper, etc. During the year the number of loads of refuse removed was 7,530, as compared with 6,660 in 1914. A statement showing the number of houses found to be without proper sanitary dustbins will be found under the heading "Housing," and in the table attached. (5) Sanitary Inspections of the District. The following tables have been prepared by the Inspector of Nuisances, and summarise the matters dealt with during the year:— 11 Inspections made during the year. Houses visited for the detection of nuisances 720 Houses inspected under the Housing and Town Planning Act 964 Slaughterhouses 97 Cowsheds, dairies and milkshops 41 Workshops 53 Outworkers' premises 6 Bakehouses 31 Offensive trades 38 Vans, tents and sheds used for human habitation 87 Complaints enquired into 168 Result of above Inspections.

Showing the number and nature of the nuisances dealt with during the year by notices served under the Public Health Acts:— Defective and choked drains 227 To repair damp and dilapidated dwellings 123 To pave yards 24 To provide water to and repair w.c. cisterns 35 To repair rainwater guttering and downpipes 58 To remedy insanitary water cisterns for domestic use 31 To repair scullery sinik wastes 48 12 To cleanse and remedy insanitary urinals 2 To remove foul accumulations 27 To prevent overcrowding 5 Animals, fowls, etc., so kept as to be a nuisance 20 To cleanse dwelling houses 12 612 Complaints. 168 complaints were received during the year, as compared with 141 in the previous year. Each complaint was investigated, and the list shows the nature of the nuisances found:— Defective and choked drains 60 Insanitary urinals 3 Dirty houses 13 Damp and dilapidated premises 24 Re water supply 8 Overcrowding of premises 5 Back yards in bad state of repair 4 House refuse not collected 18 Accumulation of filth, etc 15 Animals improperly kept 10 Re caravan dwellers 8 168 Infectious Disease. Number of cases enquired into 412 Number of cases removed to Sanatorium 256 Number of cases removed to Bow Arrow Hospital 2 Number of cases removed to Joyce Green Hospital 18 Number of houses disinfected 330 Food Inspection. The following were surrendered to me as unfit for human consumption:—1 case of Skate, 1 bag of Mussles, 1 bag of Winkles, 5 boxes of Kippers, 2 boxes of Bloaters, 1 box of Mackerel. No Tuberculous Meat was detected during the year. Cleansing. Number of cesspools emptied 401 Number of loads of house refuse removed 7530 13 Prosecutions. There were seven prosecutions during the year. Overcrowding. Five complaints were received during the year that houses wer overcrowded. These were all investigated, and in the five instances overcrowding was found. Notices were served in each of these cases, and were complied with. (6) Premises and Occupations which can be controlled by Byelaws and Regulations. Tents, Vans and Sheds. There are a number of vans and sheds situated on the Marshes at Abbey Wood which are permanently occupied by persons carrying on the trade of hawkers. In former years the numbers of these have been augmented at various periods of the year by others, who are occupied in fruit and hop-picking during the summer and autumn. Complaints have been received from time to time as to the insanitary conditions under which these people exist, and steps have been takn to have them corrected. The water supply obtained from wells and pumps was found to be impure an analysis, and ordered to be closed., but the owners contested the matter, which was brought into Court, where the necessary order was granted. During the past year these vans have been very frequently visited. The effect of the rigorous inspection carried out, and of the prosecutions in previous years, has caused a material improvement in the mode life and the surroundings of those people permanently located at this place. Factories, Offensive Trades. The trades of this description at present carried on in the District are those of Fish Frier, Fat Melter, Fat Extractor, and the Manufacture of Manure from Fish and Fish Offal. The various premises at which these trades are carried on have been periodically inspected during the year, and have been found satisfactory on each occasion, so that no notices of any kind whatever have been necessary. 14 (7) Schools. See annual Report of School Medical Officer. (8) Food, (a) Milk Supply. There are 11 cowsheds in the occupation of 5 cowkeepers, and 24 dairymen and purveyors of milk registered in the District. There are about 70 cows, and these have been regularly inspected by the Veterinary Surgon appointd by the Council. This gentleman furnishes a report quarterly to the Council, and during 1915 no case of tuberculosis was found among the cows. During the year the cowsheds, dairies and milkshops have been regularly inspected, and have on the whole been found in satisfactory condition. Three notices were served under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order; one to limewash buildings, and repair the floor and openchannel; one to provide proper lighting and ventilation; and one to limewash buildings and provide drainage. Samples of the milk sold in the District are taken by the Inspector of the Kent County Council, and out of 65 samples taken during the year, 1 was found to be slightly deficient in some way, and the other sample was found to be adultrated. (b) Slaughter Houses. There are 3 Slaughter Houses on the Register, these have been regularly inspected, and found in a clean and satisfactory condition. These inspections have been made both at times when slaughtering is in progress and at other times, but no tuberculous meat was found during the year. The animals slaughtered in the District have been in good condition, and have produced meat of good quality. (c) Bakehouses. There are 14 Bakehouses in the District, none of them being under ground. One has not been in use during the year. They have been kept under regular inspection, and with two exceptions have been found clean and satisfactory; in these cases notice was served to limewash walls and ceilings, and was complied with. 15 (d) Other Foods and Meat. The following fish was surrendered to the Inspector of Nuisances during the year:—1 case of Skate, 1 bag of Mussles, 1 bag of Winkles, 5 boxes of Kippers, 2 boxes of bloaters, 1 box of Mackerel. No Tuberculous Meat was detected. (e) Sale of Foods and Drugs Acts. The Local Authority for the administration of these Acts is the Kent County Council. I have obtained from the Clerk to the County Council a return showing the number of samples taken by their Inspector in this District during 1915, with the result of the examination of the samples, and any subsequent action taken in connection therewith. 16 The return shows that 130 samples were taken, as compared with 99 the previous year.

The majority of the houses in the District are cottages containing 4 or 6 rooms, some built in terraces, some in flats or two stories, while others are detached or semi-detached. A very great number of these have been built in recent years in accordance with the bye-laws of the Council, and these have ample airspace both at back and front. Some of the older houses, however, are somewhat cramped at the backs. In 1900 the works in the District were very busy, and practically every house in the District was occupied, while building proceeded rapidly to supply the demand for houses by the workmen who came to the District. Towards 190G, however, slackness of work, and labour troubles caused the emigration of a large number of workmen, and at one time about 750 of these cottages were empty. At the time of the Census in 1911, there were 447 uninhabited houses, the large majority of them being cottages. Since then, howevr, there has been a revival of trade in the District, and at the middle of 1915 there were no houses empty. Towards the end of the year, after the war had been in progress some months, there was a large influx of workmen, both English and Belgian, to satisfy the requirements of the ammunition factories and gun works of Messrs. Vickers. So that considerable difficulty was experienced in finding housing accommodation for so many. And although several large empty private houses were taken and let out in flats and apartments, there was much congestion, and some overcrowding. Still, this did no fully supply the demand, and many had to find residence in outlying districts, at some distance away, causing much inconvenience, but as this influx was recognised as only temporary, it was not considered advisable for the Council to undertake the great expense of building cottages to supply the deficiency. However, at the present time Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., are erecting a large number just outside the boundary, and in close proximity to the Erith Electric Trams, which ought in great measure to satisfy the demand. During the year 9G4 houses were inspected; 352 were found to have some defect in the water supply, 316 in closet accommodation, 250 in drainage, 149 in 18 tion; 328 had some evidence of dampness, 232 were dirty, in 241 the yard paving was in bad condition, in 114 there was some defect in the disposal of house refuse, while in 534 there was some defect other than those specified. As the result of these inspections, preliminary notices were served in 757 cases, pointing out the defects noted at the time of inspection, and requesting the owner to have them remedied. Wherever notices were served, re-inspection was carried out, some houses having to be visited on 3, 4, or even more occasions. The total number of visits of re-inspection made was 1,023. The result of the notices was that 99 houses had had the defects remedied by the end of the year, 140 were in course of repair, while in 518 nothing had been done. Number of houses inspected 964 Number of houses which were considered to be in such a state, or so dangerous, or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation nil Number of houses represented nil Number of Closing Orders made nil Number of houses in which defects were remedied without a Closing Order 99 Number of houses which, after the making of a Closing Orders, were put into a state fit tor human habitation nil Number of Orders for Demolition made nil Number of Orders determining Closing Orders nil A table showing the Inspections made under the Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations of the Local Government Board is appended, which also shows the defects found and number of notices served. Water Supply. In 352 houses, some defect in this was found. In the large majority of these cases the drinking water was obtained from a cistern which had no proper cover to prevent the access of dust to the water; in many cases also the cistern was found to be fixed in an unsuitable position, such as in an outhouse communicating with a water closet, in the floor of a bedroom, or so close to the 19 ceiling of a scullery that it was impossible to obtain access to it for the purpose of cleaning it out. The Metropolitan Water Board require every house supplied by them to be provided with a storage cistern, but it is always advisable for a house to have in addition, a tap supplying water direct from the main, so that drinking water, or water used in the preparation of food need not pass through the cisterns. These cisterns should always be so fixed as to be easily accessible for cleaning, they should be cleaned out regularly and covered with a closefitting dust-proof cover. Cases were noticed where a few loose boards were placed on the top of the cistern, and where there was a thick, dirty deposit in the cistern, which had not been cleaned out for months. Closet Accommodation. In 316 houses some defect was found in respect of closet accommodation. In the majority of cases the defect lay in the flushing apparatus, the flushing cistern being out of order in some cases, and in others there being a leaking joint between the flushing down pipe ana the pan. In still other cases the pan was cracked and leaking, and in others again there was no flushing apparatus at all, the closets being flushed by hand. In a certain number of cases the building itself was in a dilapidated condition. Drainage. There was some defect in the drainage in 250 houses. In most cases the defect was of a minor character, such as the absence of the mica flap in the fresh-air inlet pipe-. In some cases the top of the fresh-air inlet was broken off and the pipe filled up with rubbish; in a few cases thejoints of the upcast ventilating shaft were not properly made, allowing escape of drain air, and in others the iron cover of the inspection chamber was broken. In some cases the drain was choked, and sewage accumulated in the inspection chamber and the whole of the drains. Ventilation. In 149 houses there was some defect in the ventilation. In every case this defect was in the ventilation of the space under the ground floor. Some houses were found to have no means of ventilating this space, while in others the air-bricks or gratings were broken and blocked up with earth or rubbish. 20 Dampness There was dampness to some appreciable extent found in 328 houses. In some cases this was due to the porosity of the bricks used, the aspect of the outer walls, and the want of pointing. In other cases it was due to defective guttering and down pipes, which allowed the rain-water from the roof to run down the walls. Other cases again were caused by defective slates in the roof, while in some of the older houses the damp was due to absence of a proper damp-proof course above the foundations. Condition of Yards, etc. In 241 houses the yards at the back were found to be unpaved, or to have the paving broken and defective, or to be so laid as not to have a proper and sufficient fall to carry off the surface water. As the Councilhave adopted Section 25 of the P.H. Acts Amendment Act (1907), it was possible, when a preliminary notice failed to result in the defects being remedied, to serve a statutory notice under this section; 104 such notices were served, and by the end of the year 78 had been complied with. Disposal of Refuse. In each of the 114 cases where there was a defect in this matter, it was due to the absenceof a proper sanitary dust-bin with cover. Various kinds of substitutes were in use, buckets, zinc baths, pails, and wooden boxes, none of them being provided with a properly fitting cover; 238 notices were served to provide proper dustbins, and in 197 cases were complied with. Other Matters. In 534 houses some defect was found which could not be classified under any of the preceding heads. These were of various kinds; sink waste-pipes either not discharging into a proper gulley, or broken oft at the point where they issued through the wall, and allowing the waste water to run down the wall; defective kerbs to gulleys; absence of rain-water guttering; defects in floors, wooden or paved; dilapidated walls, plaster, and ceilings; and broken or defective window frames and doors. 21 (10) Workshops, Workplaces, etc. There are 93 workshops and workplaces on the Register, which is required to be kept by the Local Authority, but of these a number are "Domestic" workshops, i.e., only members of the family are employed. These have been inspected during the year, in four cases it was found necessary to serve notice to remedy some defects, namely, limewashing. Six lists of "Outworkers" were received from other Local Authorities, but none from employers in the District ; the premises occupied by these outworkers have been inspected, and found satisfactory in every case. C.—Sanitary Administration of the District. (1) Staff: Work of Inspector of Nuisances and other Offikers engaged in Sanitary Work. The Staff consists of myself as Medical Officer of Health, a Medical Officer in charge of the Sanatorium for Infectious Diseases (Dr. Simpson), and a School Medical Officer (Dr. Heygate); D. B. Davies, as Inspector of Nuisances, he holds the certificate of the Royal Sanitary Institute as Inspector of Nuisances, and for the inspection of Meat and other foods; T. Vaughan as Assistant Sanitary Inspector, he holds the same certificates, and his duties have been chiefly the inspection of houses under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909; also a Lady Health Visitor, Mrs. Mauley. (2) Hospital Accommodation. The Sanatorium for Infectious Diseases is situated at Little Heath, Belvedere, near the centre of the southern boundary of the District. During the year a considerable extension was carried out, namely, a large block at some distance from the main building for cases of Diphtheria, which can accommodate 14 beds and 2 cots, whilst the old wards used for that disease have been claimed for Scarlet Fever; this gives to the latter 8 more beds, a much needed want. The administrative block has also been much enlarged, as hitherto the nurses accommodation was much restricted. 22 We can now accommodate a total of 52 patients. In addition there are a porter's lodge, laundry and drying room, steam disinfector, mortuary and ambulance sheds. Two ambulances are kept, and a van for removal of infected bedding. No horses are kept at the Sanatorium, but are hired from a local contractor as necessity arises. The Staff at the Sanatorium consists of a Matron, a Sister, and 4 Nurses, with the necessary domestic staff, a porter and porteress, who resides in the porter's lodge.

The Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907 (Sections 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 31 and 33 in Part II., and Section 51 in Part III.). 23 (4) Chemical and Bacteriological Work during the Year. No laboratory is attached to the Public Health Department, but the County Laboratory, established at Maidstone, carries out any necessary bacteriological examinations. Under present arrangements each medical man practising in the District is supplied by the County Medical Officer with the necessary apparatus for taking swabs or blood, and when taken these are forwarded to Maidstone for examination. Reports on the results found are forwarded both to the medical man concerned, and also to myself as Medical Officer of Health, and at the same time fresh apparatus is forwarded to the medical man to replace the one used. During 1915 161 swabs were sent for examination for Diphtheria Bacilli, and 2 of Enteric Fever blood. During the same period 18 specimens of sputum were sent up for examination for the presence of the Tubercule Bacillus. D.—Prevalence of and Control over Acute Infectious Diseases. There were 366 cases of infectious Disease (not including cases of Tuberculosis) notified during 1915, as compared with 425 in 1914. Of these 231 were Scarlet Fever, 195 Diphtheria, 21 Erysipelas, 3 Enteric Fever, and 1 Puerperal Fever. Comparative returns of Infectious Disease notified during the past 11 years.

Of these 204 occurred in children between 5 and 15 years of age, and 0 in children between 1 and 5. Fortunately the disease was of a mild type, as may be judged from the low mortality. The attack rate for the disease was G.5 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 10.04 per 1,000 the previous year. Out of the 231 cases which occurred, 198 were removed to the Isolation Hospital for treatment. One death occurred from the disease. Return cases occurred in connection with several patients discharged from the Sanatorium. As stated in previous reports, it is impossible to eliminate these en tirely. In an endeavour to prevent their being a source of infection, a leaflet is given to the parents or relatives of each case discharged from the Hospital, pointing out that it is a potential source of infection, and advising such precautions as may obviate trouble. Diphtheria. The number of cases of Diphtheria notified during 1915 was 105, as compared with 86 in 1914. The attack rate for the disease was 2.9 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 2.8 the previous year. The number of deaths was 5. F'ifty-eight of the cases notified were removed to the Sanatorium for treatment. There were no return cases, a result due to the fact that before a case which has been suffering from Diphtheria is discharged from the Sanatorium the bacteriological examination of swabs taken from the throat must show a negative result on two consecutive occasions. Enteric Fever. Three cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year with 1 death, which was a case of a domestic servant, residing at Dartford Heath. Cases Notified. Scarlet Fever 1914 and 1915. 25 Measles. This disease was not notifiable in the District, so that it is not possible to ascertain what number of cases occurred during the year. 3 deaths occurred all between 1 and 2 years. Whooping Cough. This disease is not notifiable. There were 3 deaths due to it. All occurring under 1 year. E.-Prevalence of, and Control over, Tuberculosis. On February 1st, 1913, all forms of Tuberculosis became notifiable under Regulations of the Local Government Board; before that, only Pulmonary Tuberculosis was notifiable. Pulmonary Tuberculosis has been notifiable in this District since July, 1906. At first this notification was voluntary, but in 1908 the Local Government Board issued Regulations making all cases of Phthisis in Poor Law Institutions or receiving Poor Law Medical relief, conipulsorily notifiable. A further advance was made in 1911, when all cases of Phthisis attending a Hospital or Dispensary were made conipulsorily notifiable, while in January, 1912, all cases of Phthisis, whether in institutions or under the care of medical practitioners in private practice, were made notifiable. While voluntary notification was in force the number of cases notified was only very few, but after the introduction of compulsory notification, the number went up considerably. The number of notifications during each year since the adoption of voluntary notification is as follows:— 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 1915 10 16 12 14 24 43 59 63 Pulm. 52 Pulm. 45 pulm. 6 months only. 17 other. 10 other 11 other. 26 There were 33 deaths from various forms of Tuberculosis during 1915, of these, 24 were due to Pulmonary Tuberculosis, 4 to Tuberculous Meningitis and 5 of other forms. The death rate from all forms of Tuberculosis in 1915 was 1.02 per 1,000, as compared with 1.17 in 1914. TUBERCULOSIS. 0—1 1—2 2-5 5—15 15—25 25-45 45—65 Over 65 Total all Ages.

All cases of Tuberculosis are visited, and in the case of those suffering from the pulmonary form of the disease, disinfectants and pocket sputum cups are supplied, together with cards giving short directions as to the mode of life, and the precautions to be taken to prevent, as far as possible, the infection of other inmates of the house. Where deaths have occurred from Tuberculosis disease, or on the removal of a person who has been suffering from such disease, (he house is disinfected by the Sanitary Authority, and such disinfection is carried out at other times on request. No Sanatorium or Tuberculosis Dispensary has been provided by the Sanitary Authority, but those persons who are entitled to benefit under the National Insurance Act, have received Sanatorium treatment in 16 cases, and domiciliary treatment in other cases. Other cases which were not entitled to benefit under he Naional Insurance Act, have received treatment either as in-patients or outpatients at one or other of the London Hospitals. The facilities for treatment of persons suffering from Tuberculosis have been greatly augmented by the establishment of a Dispensary by the Kent County Council in the District in January this year, at which 106 Patients were treated and 1,003 attendances given. The educational value of a stay in a Sanatorium is already becoming evident; those cases who have had the Diagram showing comparative returns of Deaths from Tuberculosis during past 11 years P.

Black Line All Tuberculous Diseases including Pulmonary Tuberculosis Red Line Pulmonary Tuberculosis 27 advantage of such a stay, have learned by practical experience the best mode of life for themselves, and the measure best calculated to minimise the danger of their being a source of infection to other people, and they have, as far as possible, after their return home, put in practice the lessons learnt by them. Tuberculosis of all kinds is a disease very closely associated with poverty, and its attendant conditions. Overcrowding, badly ventilated houses, intemperance, and want of proper nourishment, all tend to render persons living under such conditions more susceptible to the onset of the disease. The disease itself is due to a bacillus, and it is infectious. Persons of all ages are liable to attack, but in young children the commonest sites of the disease are the glands, the joints, and the abdomen. In adults by far the commonest type of the disease is the pulmonary one, Phthisis, or Consumption. In these cases the organism causing the infection is very commonly present abundantly in the expectoration, and in the breath and spray driven out by coughing. If a person suffering from consumption spits on the floor or on the street, the spit in warm weather soon dries up, and the germs in it are carried about attached to particles of dust, and are a potential source of infection to any susceptible person. It is for the reason that consumptives are advised to carry pocket sputum cups, and to use them for the reception of the sputum, or to spit into pieces of paper or old linen, which can be burned in the fire. Open windows and an open-air life, as far as possible, abstention from alcohol, and good, nourishing food, all help to sustain the system against the attacks of the disease, which is usually of a chronic nature, and may last for years before carrying off the patient. It was at one time thought that Consumption was incurable, but greater knowledge has proved this to be erroneous, and many persons alive and well at the present day have at one time or other suffered from the disease; the earlier the disease is discovered, and the sufferer carries out the appropriate treatment, the greater the chance of recovery. The establishment of Tuberculosis Dispensaries, which is now in progress all over the country, will bring the most modern methods of diagnosis and treatment almost into the homes of the people, and the results produced by them by means of actual treatment of cases, and as educational centres, 28 should soon be evident. The hearty and intelligent cooperation of the community at large, and especially of all sufferers from Tuberculosis, is, however, essential, in order to produce the best results in the way of diminishing the incidence of the disease. F.—Means for Preventing Mortality in Childbirth and Infancy. The Midwives Act, 1902, is administered by the Kent County Council. There are 5 midwifes practising in the District, and they attend about one-half the number of confinements that occur. During the latter part of the year 1913 the Council had under consideration the question of adopting the Notification of Births Act, 1907, and it was decided to adopt it, and to appoint a Health Visitor to carry out the work (and also to act as School Nurse). This has been done. The necessary formalities for its adoption were in progress at the close of the year 1913, and the formal resolution of the Council was passed at a meeting held in January, 1914, the Act to come into force on April 1st, 1914. G—Vital Statistics. Births. During the year 1915 there were 724 births registered in the District, and notification was received that 14 births, occurring elsewhere, were transferable here, making a total of 738. This gives a nett birth rate of 20.9 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 27.28 during 1914. Of these births 716 were legitimate, while 22 were illegitimate. The birth rate for 1915 is a considerable decrease on 1914. The natural increase of population, i.e., the excess of births over deaths, was 433. 29 Deaths. The number of deaths registered in the District during 1915 was 305, giving a death rate of 8.65 per 1,000. But to it must be added 73 deaths of residents who died in other districts, making a nett total of 378 deaths belonging to the District. This gives a nett death rate of 10.5 per 1,000, as compared with 12.85 for 1914. During the first quarter of 1915 there were 98 deaths, and 111, 73, and 96 during the second, third, and fourth quarters respectively, as compared with 128, 83, 83, and 96 during the corresponding quarters of 1914. There were 22 deaths in Public Institutions in the District, all of them being those of residents.

The chief causes of death were as shown in the following table:— Natural Causes (Heart Disease) 7 Accidental Injury 7 Drowning 5 Overlaying 1 Lungs 3 Burns 3 Suffocation (Other) 2 28 30 Death registered during each month:— January 34 February 38 March 28 April 46 May 34 June 34 July 23 August 26 September 25 October 36 November 21 December 39 378 Cancer. The number of deaths clue to Cancer during 1915 was 27. This is a disease which is almost entirely confined to persons who are of middle age or over; 5 deaths occurred between the ages of 25 and 45; 8 between 45 and 65; and 13 over 65 years of age. Infantile Mortality. During 1915 the number of' deaths of children under one year of age was 54; between 1 year and 2 years, 24; and between 2 years and 5 years, 11; as compared with 76, 17, and 14 during 1913. The death rate for children under 1 year per 1,000 births is 73.17, as compared with 91.1 for 1914. If the infantile mortality rates of legitimate and illegitimate children are compared, it will be seen that the rate for illegitimate children is very much higher than that for legitimate children. In this district there were 716 legitimate births during 1915, with 49 deaths, giving a rate of 68.5 per 1,000 births, while there were 22 illegitimate births and 7 deaths during the same period, giving a rate of 318.1 per 1,000 births. In the latter part of 1913 a supplement to the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board for 1912-1913 was issued, containing a Report on Infantile Mortality in towns with a population of' more Diagram showing number of Deaths of Infants under 1 year of age during each month of 1914 and 1915. Infantile Mortality Rate. 1900-1914. 31 than 20,000, during the years 1907-1910, and 1911. During the 4 years 1911-1914, Erith's infantile mortality rate was 76.68, and there were only 16 towns with a lower rate out of the 241 towns included in the Report. Table IV. shows the causes of deaths of children from birth to 1 year of age. Ten deaths, or over 18.5 per cent. took place during the first week of life, while 15, or 27.7 per cent. occurred during the first month. Seven death,s were due to premature birth. Diarrhœa was the cause of 7 deaths, as compared with 8 in the previous year. The sanitary conditions of the District are all favourable, we have no slums, 110 back-to-back houses, plenty of open spaces and fresh air, there are no industries employing female labour to any large extent, and work being plentiful in the District, there is little or no poverty due to unemployment.
