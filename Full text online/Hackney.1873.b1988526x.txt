HAC 53 REPORT of the SANITARY STATE of the HACKNEY DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1878, by JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., L.E.C.P.E., &C., Hon. Secretary of the Meteorological Society, fyc., Medical Officer of Health to the District. Printed by order of the Board, by Andrew T. Roberts, Steam Works, Hackney Road, London. 1874. HACKNEY DISTRICT. Sanitary Offices, Town Hall, Hackney, May, 1874. REPORT FOR 1873. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, In my two last Reports I have given a considerable amount of information from the Census Tables respecting the changes in the population, the average of land and water, the ecclesiastical districts, and many other matters. I now propose laying before you some other tables which are taken from the two last volumes. The first Table shows the relative numbers of the male and female population in England, London, and Hackney, at different ages, commencing with the numbers living under five years of age, and thence in decennial periods up to 95 and upwards. 4 Table I.

The proportions of females to males were as follows: in England 1054, in London 1136, and in Hackney 1273 females to each 1000 males. These differences do not arise from the birth rates of males to females having varied in London and Hackney as compared with all England, but from the great extent to which the imigration of females into London as domestic servants, dressmakers, and assistants has occurred. This is shown especially by calculating the proportions of males to females at the ages of between 15 and 25 years of age, at which time of life females more especially pursue these avocations. In all England there were 2,040,058 females of these ages to 1,924,793 males, in London 341,617 females to 287,043 males, and in Hackney no less than 15,494 females to 10,039 males. The difference in the number of female as compared with male servants in Hackney accounts to a great extent for the preponderance of females above 15 years, as there were 7,792 female domestic servants employed in the district to 176 males. The percentages of males to females between 15 and 25 years in England, London, and Hackney are 106, 119, and 154 respectively. The proportions of female domestic servants in Hackney in comparison with the total population has not varied very greatly during the 20 years 1851-71, as at the census of 1851 there were 10 female servants to each 151 of the people, in 1861 there was 10 in each 165, and in 1871 10 in each 144. These figures show that whilst the first decade was marked by a reduction in the number of servants as compared with 1851, in the latter (1861-71) it has been marked by a considerable increase, and we are therefore justified in assuming that the 6 inhabitants of the District are generally in more easy circumstances than in 1861. I now propose laying before you a table showing the percentage of the persons living at different ages in England, London, and Hackney : Table II. Percentages of Inhabitants at different Ages in England, London, and Hackney. Ages 0 5 15 25 35 45 65 65 75 85 and above. No. in cach 1000 inhabitants. 5 16 25 35 45 55 65 75 85 England 13.5 22.6 18.4 14.8 11.4 8.8 5.8 3.35 1.2 0.15 London 13.0 20.3 19.3 17.0 12.4 8.9 5.4 2.8 0.8 0.10 Hackney 12.9 21.1 20.4 15.8 11.5 8.7 5.3 3.04 1.1 0.16 This table shows that the number of persons under 15 years of age in proportion to the whole population is less in Hackney and in London than England at large, whilst between 15 and 35 the numbers are much larger; and that above 55 there are proportionately more persons living in all England and in Hackney, than in London generally. On comparing the large number of persons living in London between 25 and 45 years with the reduced numbers above 55, we must conclude—either that an excessive death-rate occurs in Londoners above 55, or, that veiy many persons at that age have removed from London to places outside the metropolitan area. Most probably both causes are in operation, especially as we find that Hackney partakes to a great extent in the reduction of numbers at these ages. I am inclined to believe that the exodus from this district occurs chiefly amongst servants who have become too old for work, or who have married, or gone into business in country districts. It is of course evident that if these were the normal proportions of persons living in London, between the ages of 15 7 and 35, the death-rate would be a little higher than it is, as the mortality amongst persons of these ages is much less than for all ages. As the excess is only three per cent, in London, as compared with all England, the difference would evidently be but small. Table III. Hackney.

It shows that there were 34,817 unmarried persons residing in the district, of whom 12,937 were males and 21,880 females; that there were 40,119 married persons, of whom 19,701 were males and 20,418 females, (the difference between the number of wives and husbands obviously arose from the absence of the husbands or wives from the district on the day of the census); that there were 7,489 widowers and widows, of whom only 1,719 were widowers, and no less than 5,770 were widows. The table also shows the very early age at which a rather large number of the wives had married, 145 being under 15, and 1770 under 20 years of age. It also shows the comparatively small number of males to females who bad remained unmarried above 56 years of age, there being only 323 males against 1226 females. There were also 4522 widowers and widows above 55, of whom 8 1012 were males and 110 less than 3510 females. There is a singular change in the relative numbers of husbands and wives above the age of 45, as under that age the number of wives in the district is much in excess of that of the husbands, whilst above that age the proportion of husbands is at all ages in excess of that of the wives, although the total number of males alive at those ages is much below that of females. I now purpose discussing Table 4, which has been calculated from the census returns and from information kindly given to me by Mr. Clode of the Registrar General's office. The plan adopted for calculating the death-rates for the different districts wag, to eliminate the deaths in hospitals and extraneous workhouses, by which I mean workhouses situated in one district but which belong to some other parish—such as the City of London Workhouses, which are situated in Hackney, Bow, and Poplar. These deaths in extraneous workhouses were restored, as well as the population, to the districts to which they belong, but not the deaths in hospitals, as it was impossible to have done this with the materials at my disposal. The death-rates are calculated without any allowance for deaths in hospitals, and are therefore a little too low, but as the same plan is adopted for all London it cannot make much difference, except to the poorer localities which supply most patients to the hospitals. 9 Table IV.

Thus, Kensington includes Kensington, Paddington, and Fulham; Holborn includes Holborn, Clerkenwell, and St. Luke's, &c. 4.—The small figures in this column indicate the order of density of population. No. 1 signifying the least crowded district, &c 10 In glancing over the table we must not allow ourselves to conclude that the districts having the highest death-rates are the most unhealthy, or have the worst sanitary supervision, as there are many causes which modify the death-rate, such as density of population and relative wealth of the residents; the proportions of infants and yomig children to the total inhabitants ; and the ages and employment of the adults. On looking at the table we see a line drawn across it, which serves to separate the 14 districts having the lowest rate of mortality from the 14 having the highest rate. On comparing the figures, we ascertain, that the annual death-rate varies in the 14 districts which have the smallest rate of mortality, between 152 and 232 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants, which is a very considerable difference. The variation in the rate for the other districts is also very large, as in one, Marylebone, the rate was 234, and in St. George's-in-the-East no less than 286 per 10,000 inhabitants. Now it is quite evident that the difference between 152 and 286 deaths per 10,000 cannot arise from any one cause, and our main object of this table is to show, as far as possible, the chief causes. I may say, that the figures in column 3 do not agree with those published by the Registrar General, as except at long intervals, his calculations do not include the corrections for extraneous workhouses, which materially modify the results. Thus in Hackney there were, during the 10 years, 1,211 deaths in the City of London Unions, as well as 751 deaths in the German Hospital, or nearly 10 per cent, of the whole. If we now refer to column 4 setting out the number of persons to an acre, we must be struck with the great difference in the density of the population, which varies on the one hand from 5 per acre in Lewisham to 237 in Westminster. Lewisham includes also Sydenham and Penge, so that it is quite a rural district. In Woolwich there were 10, in Wandsworth 11, in Hampstead 14, Camberwell 25, Greenwich 26, and Hackney 32, against 190 in Whitechapel, 196 in Shoreditch, 197 in St. 11 George's-in-the-East, 200 in Holbom, and 219 per acre in St. Giles. Now as we can in many parts of the District with difficulty obtain 400 cubic feet of air for each adult in a living' and sleeping room, how much greater difficulty must there be to prevent injurious overcrowding in St.Giles, Whitechapel, Holborn, and St. George's-in-the-East. If we now compare the columns of the death-rate and density of population, we perceive that a certain relation exists between the two, but not at all in an uniform ratio. Thus in Greenwich with only 26 persons to an acre, the death-rate was 240; in St. Olaves with 71 to the acre, it was 245; in the Strand District with 95 to the acre, it was only 205; and in Westminster with 237 to an acre, it was only 215. On the other hand, amongst the 14 least crowded districts, no fewer than 11 had a death-rate of less than 232 per 10,000 inhabitants; whilst amongst the 14 most crowded districts, 11 have a death-rate in excess of 232, in Whitechapel it is as great as 282, and in St. George's-in-the-East it reaches 286 per 10,000 residents. If we now ascertain the mean death-rate of the 14 least crowded districts, we find it to be only 209, and of the most crowded districts no less than 240 per 10,000 residents. The possession by Hackney of 467 acres of open spaces, and 101 acres of water, ought to materially assist in modifying any injurious effects of overcrowding in certain parts of the district. The column showing the percentage of servants to population is a very important one; in the first place—because servants are generally in the prime of life and rarely die at the houses of tbeir masters, for when taken ill they are usually sent to an hospital, or workhouse, or to their friends, so that a large percentage of servants must be coincident with a somewhat diminished death-rate. But another important consideration is, that a large proportion of domestics signifies in the inhabitants an unusually great amount of the comforts, as well as the necessaries of life; plenty of living space; good clothes, food, &c., as well as prompt medical attendance. 12 If, as before, we divide the districts into two classes, we find that the mean annual death-rate is 208 per 10,000 in those districts which have the largest proportions of servants, whilst the average for the other 14 districts is as high as 249 per 10,000 inhabitants. Further, there are only 3 districts amongst the 14 having most servants, in which the mean annual mortality exceeds the average of the whole, viz., 228 per 10,000, and on the other hand, amongst the 14 districts in which there are fewest servants, there are no less than 8 which have a death-rate in excess of the average. We should have expected, in merely glancing at the column and seeing that the proportion of servants to total number of residents varied between, 107 per 1000 in St. George's, Hanover Square, 96 in Hampstead, 79 in Kensington, 64 in Hackney, and only 22 in Shoreditch, 22 in St. Olave's, and 19 per 1000 in Bethnal Green, that the death-rate would vary. The variation however, like that observed in the most densely crowded districts, does not precisely correspond with the number of servants; and it is only when we include in one column the districts having the least overcrowding and the most servants, and in another the greatest overcrowding and fewest servants, that the effect of the combined influences can be appreciated. Thus in the 9 districts which contain the smallest proportion of persons to an acre and the largest number of servants, the mean annual death-rate was as low as 195 per 10,000 residents; in the other group of greatest density of population and fewest servants, the annual rate was as high as 257 per 10,000 persons. I mention these matters that you may see the importance of suppressing overcrowding in your district, and be prevented from supposing that the healthiness or unhealthiness of a district is to be judged of by its death-rate alone. It is however quite certain, that the small death-rate of Hackney does not entirely arise from the comparative absence of overcrowding and the large number of servants, as it is seventh as 13 regards density of inhabitants, and eighth as regards the proportion of servants to total inhabitants. We must, therefore, look to other causes, and may conclude that the comparative absence of manufactories; the open country adjacent to its eastern boundaries; its soil and the inclination of the ground; the large proportion of persons in good circumstances; and the active sanitary works carried out, all contribute to the satisfactory result of its being the third in the list of districts having an unusually small death-rate. Having now passed in review the various tables relating to the last census, I shall now pass on to the discussion of tables which relate to the district alone. Table V. 1878.—Births in each Sub-District. 52 Weeks. Quarters. Stoke Newingtn. Stamford Hill. West Hackney. Hackney. South Hackney. Totals. First 99 52 287 457 278 1173 Second 110 44 267 378 255 1054 Third 112 48 267 400 259 1086 Fourth 96 53 269 425 275 1118 Totals 417 197 1090 1660 1067 4431 This table shows that the births varied slightly in the different quarters, the largest number having been registered in the first quarter, and the smallest in the second quarter; that there were 417 births registered in Stoke Newington, 197 in Stamford Hill, 1090 in West Hackney, 1660 in Hackney, and 1067 in South Hackney. As compared with last year the numbers are in excess for Stoke Newington, West Hackney, Hackney, and South Hackney, but less in Stamford Hill sub-district. The increase for the year was only at the rate of 21 per 1000 births, which is rather less than the average of late years. 14 The next table for consideration is that of the deaths. Table VI. 1873.—Deaths in each Sub-District. 52 Weeks. Quarters. Stoke Newingtn. Stamford Hill. West Hackney. Hackney. South Hackney. Totals. First 54 27 162 301 138 682 Second 43 31 116 239 110 539 Third 62 36 140 265 164 667 Fourth 66 32 138 326 146 706 Totals 224 126 546 1140 558 2594 We see that there were 224 deaths registered in Stoke Newington against the 417 births; 126 deaths in Stamford Hill against 197 births; 546 deaths in West Hackney against 1090 births; 1140 deaths in Hackney sub-district against 1660 births; and 558 deaths in South Hackney to 1067 births; or a total of 2594 deaths to 4431 births. The proportion of births to deaths was as large as 171 of the former to each 100 of the latter. This is a little smaller than last year, but, with that exception, is in excess of any year since 1861. The deaths registered in the Hackney sub-district include those in the Union Workhouse, the City of London Union, and the German Hospital; also, all the deaths which occur amongst the residents of the district in the Small-Pox and Fever Hospitals. It is obvious from this, that it is useless to compare the number of deaths in the various sub-districts unless corrections are made for these deaths, and even then, as the proportionate number of residents in the sub-districts has altered since the census, the comparison would not afford reliable date. The largest number of deaths occurred in the first and last quarters of the year, when the mean temperature for each was 15 below the average, although in January the weather was unusually warm, and rather warmer than the mean in March, in consequence of the excessive cold in February. I have often pointed out, that from a considerable portion of the district being situated near to the Marshes or the crest of the hill bounding this side of London, we suffer more from excessive cold than the metropolis at large. On the other hand, April, May, and June were unusually cold, and the death-rate was unusually low. In July and August we had an unusual amount of heat, whilst in September the thermometer recorded a deficiency of heat amounting to above two degrees for each day. The number of deaths registered in this quarter was above the average to a rather large extent, as always occurs when July and August are unusually hot. As will be seen by referring to the table of deaths from epidemic diseases, this excess of mortality chiefly arose from deaths from diarrhcea amongst children. The total mortality was greatest in the winter quarter, when the temperature was below the mean in October, and a little above it in November and December. Table VII. Deaths in Hackney, 1873.

Although there was a much larger proportion of deaths from diarrhoea than usual, yet the percentage was much below the average of the preceding 17 years. There were 392 deaths from tubercular diseases, or at the rate of 15.1 deaths per cent, against an average of 16.9, which, with the diminution in the former class, indicate an improved sanitary condition of the district, as well as the absence of any special epidemic. Diseases of the nervous system was fatal in 330 cases, or at the rate of 12.3 per cent, against the mean of 12.0 per cent.; of the circulatory organs 175, or 5.8 per cent., which was above the average. Affections of the respiratory organs were, on the other hand, unusually fatal, as no less than 495, or 19.1 per cent, of the total deaths were registered from these causes. The average is 16.0 per cent., and the chief mortality occurred in young children under 1 year and in old persons above 65 years of age, arising from the changeable and cold weather in February and the early winter months. The number of deaths from premature birth, debility, and atrophy was 180, which is considerably in excess of former years, and assisted in swelling the large number of deaths under 1 year. The deaths from old age were less than usual, viz. 160, or 6.2, against the mean of 6.8 per cent. There were also 85 deaths from violence, which was a little below the average; and 162 inquests were held, which was more than usual. There were 20 deaths from suffocation, 18 of which were infants in bed; 20 from drowning, chiefly in the river Lea; 8 from burns and scalds; and 23 from fractures and contusions, which includes several persons who were run over in the streets or on the railways. 17 Table VIII. 1862-73.—Deaths from Seven Epidemic Diseases.

Indeed, if there had not been a very large number of deaths from diarrhœa, which can scarcely be termed an epidemic, the total number would have been smaller, after allowing for increase of population, than in any year since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act. There were 9 deaths from small-pox; 28 from measles; 27 from scarlet fever; 21 from diphtheria; 81 from whooping cough; 53 from fever, of which 8 were cases of simple fever, 37 typhoid, and 8 of typhus. This total of fever cases is small, and very satisfactory when we consider that all the deaths in the Fever Hospital are now recorded for the district. I do not expect so favourable a report for 1874, or 1875, as it is most probable that measles will prevail in the former year, and scarlet fever in both years, being worst in 1875, or the epidemic of scarlet fever may not occur until 1875, reaching its culminating point in 1876. There were 10 deaths from these causes in each 68 deaths, but only 1 death in each 355 inhabitants, which is very small. 1* Table IX. Hackney.—Ages at Death in 1873. 1873.

The rate this year is very high owing to the large number of infantile deaths from diarrhoea, convulsions, bronchitis, premature birth, debility, and atrophy. The total number of deaths under 1 year was 671, out of which no less than 334 were registered as caused by the affections just enumerated. The percentage for the year was 25.9 per cent, of the total deaths, against the 23 years' average of 21.6 per cent. There were 357 deaths above 1 year and under 5, or 13.7 per cent., making a total of 1028 deaths under 5 years, or 39.6 per eent. of the whole, against the average of 37.6 per cent. There were 90 deaths between 5 and 15, or 3.5 per cent.; 116 between 15 and 25, or 4.5 per cent., which is the smallest rate at these ages, with one exception, which has been registered since 1850. There were 178 deaths between 25 and 35, or 6.9 per cent.; 182 between 35 and 45, or 7.0 per cent.; 193 between 45 and 55, or 7.4 per cent.; 232 between 55 and 65, or 9.0 per cent.; 277 between 65 and 75, or 10.7 per cent.; 229 between 75 and 85, or no less than 8.8 of the whole. There were 62 persons who lived for a longer period than 85 years; 7, or 0.2 per cent, who reached the exceeding great age of 95 and upwards. There were no less than 114 deaths registered, out of each 1000, above what 19 is considered the ordinary limit of human life, against an average of 103 for 23 years. If, therefore, the large mortality of children under 1 year is to be considered an indication of retrogression, which I do not think it is, at any rate the increased longevity of so considerable a proportion of the population may fairly be deemed to balance it. The number of deaths in the City of London Union and the German Hospital is about equal to the proportion of deaths in all the Metropolitan Hospitals to the population of all London. It will not, therefore, be necessary to make any alteration in the number of deaths for Hackney. Now calculating the population to have been 135,024 in the middle of the year and the total deaths for the year 2,594, we have a death-rate for the year equal to 192 per 10,000 population, against 224 for all London. This is a very satisfactory return, as the rate is one of the smallest which has occurred since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The rate of births to deaths, as before stated, was very high, viz., 171 births to each 100 deaths; and the proportion of births to total population, viz., 1 in each 30 inhabitants, is equally satisfactory. As previously mentioned, the deaths in autumn and early winter were unusually high, but not in greater proportion than those for all London, as the annual Metropolitan death-rate was no less than 253 per 10,000 inhabitants during the three months ending December 31st. I have attended 30 meetings of the Sanitary Committee, 13 of the View Committee, and 6 of other Suit-Committees, making a total of 49 Sanitary Committee meetings in the year. Many very important matters were discussed at these meetings and reports brought up to the Board, amongst which I may mention—(1) on the arrangements for the removal of house refuse, dust, ashes, &c.; (2) on the duties of the Sanitary Staff; (3) on the Regulations under the New Water Act; (4) on the Approaches to the Small-Pox Hospital; (5) on the duties and emoluments of the Analyst. 20 The question of the removal of dust received much consideration, and it was eventually decided to recommend the Beard to advertise for tenders at a lump sum, and at per load. On the tenders being sent in it was found that the lowest lump sum was £2700, and the highest £3150; that the lowest sum at per load was 2 '11, and the highest 3/1. The Contractor was to include in the tender the cost of providing a horse and man for each cart as well as the usual implements for the removal of dust. The total cost was very nearly that of the lump sum, being £2344 19s. for the removal of 16,091 loads of dust, and £300 19s. for the payment of our men, making a total of £2651 18s. against the £2700 lump sum. This is very satisfactory, as the work has been done unier our own superintendence instead of under the control of the Contractor. In addition to this sum was the amount paid to the Dust Inspector of £65 10s., but as this must have been paid under any circumstances, I have not included it in the total. The number of complaints were very much smaller than when the work was performed at a lump sum, as there were only 1705 complaints against 2822 in 1S70-71, which was the Aast year that a different system prevailed. The largest number of carts employed was 19, and of men 31; whilst the smallest number of carts was 11, and of men 21. As the Contractor provides one man to each cart, the largest number of men in the pay of the Board was 12, and the smallest 10. The Regulations made by the Water Companies for those houses in which a constant supply was laid on were reported by the Committee as being unnecessarily onerous, but it was deemed advisable that no exhaustive report should be presented until a block of houses had been furnished with the fittings approved by the Company. The Committee considered that great difference would exist in the fittings, in consequence of the landlords being able practically to decide what sized ferule should be used for the supply. There was, also, much doubt as to the necessity for the Urge sized supply pipe to the pan, but I must say that a far 21 more effectual flush, with a given quantity of water, is made with the full sized pipe than with the one ordinarily employed. The Sub-Committee held two meetings on the Approaches to the Small-Pox and Fever Hospitals, and came to the following resolution : " That in the opinion of the Sub-Committee appointed to view the approaches to the Small-Pox and Fever Hospitals, the inhabitants of the locality incur serious risk to health in consequence of the inadequate approaches to the said hospitals, and that therefore it is desirable to secure improved communications therewith from High Street, Homerton." I was requested by the Committee, when the resolution was submitted to them, to write to the Managers of the Asylums Board ; and received a communication, that the Committee of the Homerton Asylums could not recommend their Board to take any action the matter, and that their Board had adopted the report. The Committee also considered your reference re the duties and emoluments of the Public Analyst, and brought up a report recommending that your Medical Officer of Health should be appointed, and that the salary should be provisionally fixed for one year at £75 Os. Od., which report you adopted. They also advised the fitting up the Laboratory in a good and substantial way, and that the cellar adjoining the Laboratory should be excavated and made into a room, which has been done at a comparatively small expense, so that the Laboratory is now large enough for carrying on the work requisite for this District. In connection with the Analytical work, I may mention, that the Committee considered the retention by the Police Authorities of the penalties inflicted under the Act as most unfair towards the Local Authorities, who have all the trouble and expense of procuring a conviction. They, therefore, directed me to apply to the Secretary of State for the Home Department for the futun penalties. The letter was written on the 29th day of November, and an answer received on the 6th day of December to the effect—that the penalties under this Act are payable to th^ 22 Receiver of Police and not to the Vestry, and the Under-Secretary of State referred to the decision in the cases of Wray v. Ellis, Ellis and Ellis, 276. As the number of cases of infectious diseases has been smaller than for some time past, the disinfecting chamber has not been so much used as in former years. The bedding, clothes, &c., were removed from 21 houses only, and the total number of articles disinfected was 243. The cost of performing the work was £15 Is. 4d., there was, however, a sum of £4 paid for repairs, making the total cost for the year £19 1s. 4d. The total number of houses disinfected was 69. As previously stated, I attended the View Committee in their inspections on 11 days of the cowsheds and slaughterhouses, and on 2 days at the Sessions House, Great Prescott Street. The number of days occupied in viewing was much greater than usual this year, in consequence of several of the persons neglecting to comply with the orders of the Committee, so that a second and in some instances a third visit was requisite, besides those paid by the officers. There were no less than 8 persons opposed, 6 at the first Special Sessions and 2 at the second, these latter were new applications. The Justices ordered in the first instance all the applications to stand over to the adjourned day, and finally refused two. There were 89 cowsheds and 82 slaughterhouses to which licenses were granted. The paving was indifferent in a rather large number, and decidedly bad in three, whilst no less than 99 required to be lime-whited and cleansed, but the whole of the necessary works were carried out before the licenses were granted. The applications were opposed in two cases where there was not any water supply except that from a well, which the Committee, as well as myself, considered most undesirable, as there cannot be any certainty as to the wholesomeness of pump water in this district, especially when, as these were, the wells have been made in crowded localities. A careful inspection of the bakehouses was made, when a 23 large proportion were found to be dirty from want of whitewashing. The total number inspected was 125. There was not any instance of the bakehouse being illegally used as a sleepingroom, or any lad employed contrary to the provisions of the Act. The number of bad overcrowding cases discovered this year was by no means large, viz. 32, and but few were of an indecent character. Now considering that we annually inspect above 6000 houses, and enquire as to the number of inmates in all, this is a very small number. The worst cases were as follows : at No. 4, Union Row, Kingsland, the first floor was occupied by three sisters, between 17 and 22 years of age, and two brothers, one 23 and the other 11; this room was large enough for three people only. In a small room in Frederick Terrace, Fox Lane, there slept and lived two women, not related, and a man. In a room which had the cubical capacity for accommodating only a grownup person and one child, there lived and slept the father, mother, and three children under 10 years of age. There were living and sleeping in another room in Palatine Houses, which was large enough only for two persons and a child, the father, mother, and four children, the eldest a girl being 13 and the others younger. In a room at Homer Place, Hackney Wick, there were living and sleeping the father, mother, a son of 19, a daughter of 13, and two young children. In a four-roomed house in Duncan Square we found no less than twenty-one grown-up persons, so that there were five persons in each of three rooms and six in another. At Church Road, Homerton, we discovered a widow and six children living and sleeping in a room only large enough for a grown-up person and two children under 10 years old. In a room which contained only 678 cubic feet of air, and therefore only large enough for a grown-up person and one child, we found a man, his wife, and four children living and sleeping. The other instances of overcrowding were not so bad. If we consider the number of our population, and especially the number of houses under twenty pounds a year rental (about 14 6000), these are but a small number of cases to have been discovered on inspection. It is, however, very probable that the true number was not in all instances given to the Inspector. There cannot be any doubt that the pulling down of houses occupied by the poor in making wider streets, railways, and other improvements, tends to throw a large surplus population on this district. But as the district does not contain many manufactories, the crowding together has not been so large as it otherwise would have been, as workpeople, permanently employed, like to live as near their work as they can. The question of providing dwellings for the poor is becoming a more pressing question than ever, and yet without any satisfactory plan for remedying the evil in London having been fairly discussed. It seems almost hopeless to expect that all the Metropolitan Vestries and Boards of Works would carry out plans similar to those which have been so successful in Glasgow. It is also a question if such extensive powers, as are necessary for raising the necessary funds, should be entrusted to any one public corporation. There is also another difficulty amongst the poor themselves, as they prefer occupying a certain class of house wherever they can do so, and overcrowding will to a certain extent take place, even when better houses are provided. The portion of income which can be set aside for rent will be, as a rule, in proportion to the earnings, and not to the accommodation required, so that persons with very small incomes and large families will always, more or less, overcrowd their rooms, unless in model lodging houses where they are somewhat controlled. A great deal has been done in this district for the prevention of disease by cleansing, whitewashing, and draining the houses, but your sanitary staff is powerless to amend the original structural defects in very many houses, and therefore much which we object to remains unaltered. It is obvious if the powers of pulling down houses more or less unfit for human habitation be strictly enforced, without any corresponding powers to compel the owners to build them up again, the overcrowding 25 is likely to be made worse and greater injury to health sustained, as an overcrowded dwelling is more injurious to health and mortality than one which is badly constructed. My attention has also been called, as well as that of the Inspectors, to unusually large quantities of putrid fish which were unfit for food. In all cases the fish were rendered quite unsaleable by pouring carbolic acid over them, but proceedings were not taken against the owners as they were willing that this course should be adopted. The total quantity destroyed in this way was 53 pads, chiefly of plaice. The other sanitary work carried out during the year consisted in the examination of no less than 6301 houses. Every room in these houses was examined and entries made in the inspection book as to their state, as well as to the condition of the cisterns or water-butts, of the drainage in the yards and waterclosets, of the paving in the yards, and the condition of the gutters of the houses and out-buildings. The enquiry also extended as to the number of families and inmates, and to the state of health. The tables containing some of these particulars and forming part of the appendix, shew that in these 6301 houses there were 25,972 inhabited rooms, 6,713 families, and 36,763 inmates. The number of houses inspected was greater than in any former year, whilst the number of persons residing in them was also a little in excess, but not in a greater ratio than the number of houses. At the last census there were on an average 66 persons residing in each ten houses (6.6 per house), whilst in the 6301 houses of the poor there were only 58 per ten houses, or 5.8 per house. This shews a much less number of residents to a house than in London at large, as at the census there were 74 persons to each ten houses in the Metropolis. The number of nuisances found in these 6,301 premises was 2,804, which is nearly 300 more than in 1872. As will be seen by the table of Sanitary work, all those nuisanccs, as well as many others, have been abated. 28 The figures just quoted shew that 44 per cent, of the houses inspected were in some way or other defective, although every house had been carefully examined the year before. The defects consisted in the want of whitewashing, cleansing, and repairing; of proper paving or drainage in the yards; of choked or badly constructed water-closets; of want of proper and sufficient water supply or apparatus; or of choked or badly made house-drains. In many houses an aggregation of these nuisances, with the bad construction of the houses themselves, rendered them uninhabitable. Amongst these may be specially mentioned houses in Homerton and Hackney Wick; but I am glad to say that by exerting continuous pressure on the owners, and summoning the most refractory, the whole of the works necessary to prevent the houses from being injurious to health have been done. They certainly were not all completed until February of the present year, but the repairs have been unusually well carried out. In addition to the 6,301 houses inspected under the provisions of the Sanitary Act, there were 374 premises examined on complaints received at the office, and 70 in which epidemic disease had broken out, so as to render disinfection necessary. There were 89 cowsheds, 82 slaughterhouses, 148 greengrocers' yards, 61 poulterers' and fishmongers' yards examined, and all nuisances found thereon were removed. Also, as before mentioned, 125 bakehouses, and S3 urinals were examined more than once. These, with 20 houses in which the rooms were measured, make up a total of 7,353 separate premises inspected, which is above the average number. The number of nuisances on these premises was as follows: 1,325 from defective drainage; 3,326 from defects in the interior of the houses; 343 from want of proper paving; and 412 from other causes. The nuisances from defective drainage were, 292 from choked or broken drains; 679 from want of proper traps; 95 from choked water-closet pans; 15 from cesspools; and 244 from want of proper surface drainage; and 343 of proper paving in the yard. There were no 27 less than 2,437 houses which required to be whitewashed, cleansed, and repaired; 687 where the dust-bins were broken or absent; and 186 in which a better water supply was provided. The other nuisances will be found set out in the appendix. In order to obtain the removal of so large a number of nuisances, it was necessary to serve 5,876 notices, and to take out 75 summonses. There were also 1,705 requests to remove the dust attended to, and a large amount of other work carried out. As, with one exception, the whole of the Sanitary staff was changed during the year, either by dismissal or promotion, I had to devote an unusually large amount of personal supervision to the work, and will conclude by expressing my satisfaction with the manner in which the duties were performed by the Inspectors, considering that three out of the four were new to the work to be done.
