To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, The report of the 1961 Census shows that the population of the borough on the night of the Census was 22,008. Thus during the preceding ten years the population decreased annually by 1.19 per cent. Between 1931 and 1951 however, the annual decrease has been much greater—2.22 per cent. A small part of this decrease was caused by an excess of deaths over births, but the major part was due to migration from the borough. During the past ten years also, the proportion of children under the age of 15 has decreased from 13.3 per cent, to 12.1 per cent, while the proportion of people over 65 has increased from 10.5 per cent. to 12.1 per cent. These changes in population are not restricted to Holborn, and their causes are many and varied. Although the movement of people away from city centres has many unfortunate consequences, life in such centres has special limitations and dangers, particularly for the very old and the very young. The concentration of road traffic and the density of building in particular impose unnatural stresses on residents. The birth rate for the borough is lower and the death rate higher than for many years, but these rates are calculated from such relatively small numbers that variations from year to year mean very little. Diseases of the heart and circulatory system were again the commonest causes of death. Cancers were the next most common cause and they were most frequently located in the lung. Only two Holborn infants died before the age of one year; they were twins born prematurely. There were no illegitimate infant deaths. There has been no maternal deaths since 1953. During the opening weeks of the year many smallpox contacts were kept under surveillance, but no case occurred in the borough. Consequent upon the spate of vaccinations which were performed at this time, a case of post vaccinial encephalitis was reported. Fortunately the illness was mild and had no serious effects. Two unrelated cases of poliomyelitis were notified. The first was admitted during the acute stage of his illness to a private room in a general hospital in the borough. As a precaution all the nursing staff were given oral poliomyelitis vaccine. The other patient suffered a mild non-paralytic illness. There was no case of diphtheria. There were few notifications of dysentery or food poisoning. A small outbreak of dysentery in a day nursery was quickly contained. The number of new notifications of tuberculosis received during the year was the smallest ever. Four of the sixteen cases were residents of a common lodging house. The men who choose to live in this institution should receive much closer medical supervision, but because of their unsettled way of life and independence of mind this is difficult to achieve. General medical services are available and the Mass X-ray unit makes a yearly visit there, but the response is poor. On December 1st the sixth and last smoke control order came into operation, thus finishing the programme started by Dr. Struthers in 1957. The early completion of the scheme was the result of much hard work by the staff, the ready co-operation of government departments and the enthusiasm of the Council. The occasion was marked by a press conference attended by Sir Keith Joseph on December 3rd. 8 The effect of the smoke control orders is now becoming evident. Measurements made during the year show a satisfactory decline in the amount of smoke in the air compared with previous years, and further reductions are to be expected. During the period December 3rd to 8th there occurred the worst smog since 1952. Happily the mortality associated with this episode was not nearly as great as happened ten years ago. Pollution was at its worst on December 5th when the average smoke concentration for the day was nearly 1,500 ugms. per cubic metre of air. A report by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research shows however, that at sites in neighbouring boroughs the average smoke concentrations for the day were from 2,400 to 3,900 ugms. per cubic metre. Not all atmospheric pollution comes from chimneys. At its meeting in July the Council's attention was directed to pollution from motor vehicle exhausts. On the Council's instruction a note on the subject was prepared and submitted to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee. Subsequently, equipment to measure smoke in the air at street level was purchased and is now in use. I regret that little progress was made with the slum clearance programme during the year. The County Council made a clearance order in respect of premises in Drury Lane. The number of houses yet to be dealt with is small and I hope that in its essentials the programme will be fulfilled. More public health notices were served during the year than usual. Most of them related to a single property which gave cause for some concern and considerably exercised the public health inspectors. Services to old people in the borough have been further extended. The old people on our register number about 900 or just over a quarter of all persons of pensionable age in the borough. This includes however, two-thirds of those over 80 years of age. In November the Council decided to take full financial responsibility for the Mealson-Wheels service, which continues to be provided by the W.V.S. Inability to get out and about is probably the most serious misfortune of old age, since not only are the mechanics of living hampered, but social life is seriously curtailed. Thus on hearing that the W.V.S. were having difficulty in bringing members to the handicapped club, the Council, in December, approved the purchase of a Minibus, suitably adapted. The bus is now in full use. The alterations to the bathing centre which included the installation of an additional bath were completed in March, and enable us to offer a warm bath to elderly people who do not have one at home, and are not agile enough to use the public baths. Consequent on the publication by the Royal College of Physicians of their report on the effects of smoking on health, an exhibition was arranged in the entrance hall of the Central Library. Included were original displays produced in the department, and a specimen of lung cancer obtained for us by Councillor Dr. Macdonald Critchley. In addition to the usual display of double crown posters throughout the borough, a large poster was commissioned and posted at Underground Stations in the borough. This is my last annual report in Holborn and I wish to record my thanks to all the members and officers of the Council who in their several ways have made the last few years both memorable and pleasant for me. I am grateful in particular to the members of my own department whose faithful and diligent work is here recorded. I am, Your obedient Servant, G. W. PIPER, Medical Officer of Health. 9 SECTION 1. General Information and Statistical Summary. General Holborn, with an area of 405 acres, is the smallest of the Metropolitan Boroughs. It is about 1¼ miles long, extending from Tottenham Court Road in the West to Farringdon Road in the East, and averages about half a mile in width.

The Home Service Ambulance Department (Order of St. John of Jerusalem and British Red Cross Society) and the Hospital Car Service act as agents of the County Council in supplying some of the ambulance and car transport provided under the Act. The Headquarters of the London Ambulance Service are at The County Hall, Westminster Bridge, S.E.1. Ambulances may be summoned as follows:— (1) Accidents— Sudden illness in the streets, public places or places of employment. (Note—For sudden illness in the home a doctor, not an ambulance, should be summoned.) (2) Maternity patients (who have booked a bed in a hospital or maternity home)— Very urgent illness in the home (provided a medical practitioner certifies that the case is urgent and arrangements have been made with a hospital for the patient's admission). Dial "999" (or follow the instructions given on the telephone instrument) and ask for— " AMBULANCE." Telephone— WATerloo 6000 CENtral 6301 REGent 4000 RELiance 3622 or NEW Cross 2645 12 (3) Illness, infectious disease, etc.— Normally the hospital to which the patient is to be admitted will summon the ambulance, if one is necessary, by telephoning WATerloo 3311 This applies also to patients being discharged from hospital or attending there as out-patients. Emergency Bed Service (King Edward's Hospital Fund for London) The Emergency Bed Service was founded in 1938 to assist general practitioners in finding beds for acute emergency cases. Since the 5th July, 1948, the Service, working in close co-operation with the Ambulance Service, has acted as agent for the four Metropolitan Regional Hospital Boards for the admission of all types of cases except mental and tuberculous. The Central Office of the Emergency Bed Service is at 28, London Bridge Street, S.E.1, (Telephone HOP 7181). 13 SECTION 2. Births and Deaths STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1962.

The numbers of both males or females who have died of pulmonary tuberculosis have declined while the numbers of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung or bronchus have increased. The Table shows the higher incidence in men for both diseases, and that over the last ten years these neoplasms have produced a wastage of life greater than that of pulmonary tuberculosis. 19 SECTION 3.

Dysentery Seven cases were notified and three of them were removed to hospital. Four cases were the result of an outbreak of Shigella sonnei infection in the Kingsway Creche. Numerous swabs were taken and examined by the Public Health Laboratory, County Hall, the positive cases being excluded from the Creche under care of their own doctors until three consecutive negative specimens had been obtained. Food Poisoning Two cases were notified and were removed to hospital One of these cases a threeyear old daughter of a serviceman was brought from Accra, Ghana to a hospital in Holborn. She was found to be suffering from Salmonella St. Paul, and later died from the infection. Encephalitis (Acute) One case was notified and was removed to hospital. Meningococcal Infection One case was notified and removed to hospital where the patient died. 21 Malaria One case was notified and was removed to hospital. The infection had been contracted abroad. Measles Twenty-two cases were notified and one was removed to hospital. Pneumonia (Acute Primary and Acute Influenzal) One case of acute primary pneumonia, and one case of acute influenzal pneumonia, were notified. The former case was removed to hospital. Poliomyelitis Two cases were notified. The first patient, notified from a hospital in the borough, resided in another borough, and had had one injection only of polio vaccine two months before his illness. The second patient, a Holborn resident, had had two inoculations of polio vaccine in the U.S.A. four years before her illness. Scabies Five cases were notified, and were treated at home. Scarlet Fever One case was notified, and was treated at home. Tuberculosis See page 48. Whooping Cough Two cases were notified during the year.

This work is carried out by the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, 23 Queen Square, W.C.I, and by the Public Health Laboratory Service at County Hall. During the year 316 specimens were submitted for examination with the following results:— Disease Positive Negative Total Diphtheria (Nasal and throat swabs) — 7 7 Dysentery (Faecal swabs) 15 273 288 Food Poisoning (Faecal swabs) 2 6 8 Streptococcus haemolyticus 1 5 6 Vincents organisms — 3 3 Other pathogenic organisms 2 2 4 Infectious Disease Contacts Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are paid only on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was not found necessary to issue any such certificate during the year. International Certificates of Vaccination The International Sanitary Regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly on 25th May, 1951, prescribe inter alia that International Certificates, to be valid, must bear an approved stamp which certifies that the signature of the vaccinator is that of a doctor. During the year 4,685 certificates of persons travelling abroad were authenticated by the Department. Of these 4,615 were in respect of smallpox, 53 for cholera, 12 for typhoid, 2 for yellow fever, and 3 for poliomyelitis. Diphtheria Immunisation During the year 238 Holborn children completed the primary course of immunisation against diphtheria, and 262 received boosting doses. 24 25 TABLE No. 7 Comparative Figures of Infectious Disease for the last 30 years Disease 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 (Population) 36,050 36,000 35,400 34,850 34,600 34,350 30,660 23,470 17,160 16,580 17,240 18,020 18,680 21,190 23,460 24,960 i 25,490 25,930 24,540 23,950 23,710 23,340 23,060 22,640 22,230 21,870 21,370 21,000 20,520 20,640 Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup) 75 74 93 60 76 49 19 7 14 17 17 5 11 12 3 2 1 2 - - - - - - - 1 2 — — — Dysentery — 2 6 6 10 10 — — — — 2 13 2 6 — 4 — 2 34 9 8 34 4 7 16 30 28 41 2 7 Encephalitis Lethargica 1 1 1 - - - 2 - - - - - 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 Enteric Fever 1 3 2 2 — — 1 1 3 1 6 1 — 1 1 1 — 1 — 2 1 2 — — 4 — — — — — Erysipelas 19 12 18 19 10 15 13 12 3 7 3 8 3 4 8 6 5 3 1 2 1 1 1 — — 1 2 — 2 — Food Poisoning 5 — — 3 5 2 - - - - - - 1 — 1 2 3 1 2 1 4 2 12 1 2 11 19 6 4 2 Malaria 1 1 3 2 3 — 1 — — — 1 — — — — — — 1 1 — 1 1 — — — 1 — — — 1 Measles Notifiable as from 9th September, 1938. — 8 39 34 58 219 33 103 107 157 87 170 137 254 133 195 37 172 71 99 56 139 38 122 22 Meningococcal Infection 3 1 1 2 1 1 3 7 7 1 1 — 1 2 2 - - - - - 2 1 2 2 1 — 4 1 — 1 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 6 6 4 3 3 5 4 4 1 5 4 4 1 4 3 3 3 2 — 2 3 — 1 — — — 1 — — — Pneumonia (Acute primary & Acute-influenzal) 37 38 21 30 34 21 28 14 18 20 22 14 6 17 15 9 9 5 8 4 4 4 — 3 4 2 6 3 2 2 Polio-encephalitis Acute - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 — Poliomyelitis Acute - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 — 5 1 2 2 — 6 17 3 12 6 11 4 2 2 1 2 *Puerperal Fever 3 3 4 2 4 — — — 1 2 2 2 2 — 1 1 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Puerperal Pyrexia 5 2 4 3 2 2 3 3 2 7 3 1 4 5 5 2 4 2 3 1 - - - - - - - - - - Scabies Notifiable as from 1st August, 1943. 54 99 125 106 43 16 4 3 4 3 6 1 5 5 1 3 2 5 1 5 Scarlet Fever 96 115 50 67 38 59 56 20 16 23 30 20 14 24 29 13 15 16 21 18 10 5 4 4 8 9 7 4 5 1 Smallpox 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Tuberculosis Pulmonary 50 83 68 77 66 71 64 44 47 45 51 41 59 55 47 39 42 39 45 46 48 32 40 33 32 25 27 18 21 15 Tuberculosis, Non-Pulmonary 9 6 5 13 10 8 5 3 6 8 3 9 9 5 4 8 6 5 — 2 3 4 4 3 — 2 — 1 2 1 Whooping Cough 23 65 99 76 60 53 71 7 42 48 38 30 11 43 23 74 5 90 33 32 62 6 1 22 6 3 4 9 7 2 335 412 379 365 322 296 278 161 194 242 456 280 364 392 348 268 269 311 406 261 366 133 258 157 184 148 243 128 170 62 "Ceased to be notifiable as from 30th July, 1948. 26 SECTION 4.

Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. One complaint of impure water was received. Upon investigation it was found that the condition of the water was due to the state of the storage tank, and the tank was renewed. Drainage During the year 3,776 inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 132 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 112 Combined Drainage Orders were made. In 3 cases, consent was given to the carrying out of work on the single stack system of drainage. L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, 1953—Part II Discharge of trade effluent into sewers. Empowers the London County Council and Borough Councils to control the volume and content of new or modified effluents proposed to be discharged from trade premises into sewers. 30 During 1962, 9 notifications were received concerning the proposed discharge of trade effluents. In 5 cases notices of proposed conditions were issued by this Council and no counter proposals were received. In the remaining cases the proposed discharge was of a domestic nature and no conditions were prescribed. Clean Air Act, 1956 During the year 31 complaints were received regarding smoke emissions and 178 observations were made. In most cases, it was found that the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Public Health Inspectors. The routine of making special observations from the roofs of four tall buildings was continued, and as in previous years these observations were helpful in checking the behaviour of boiler plant, especially in connection with plant installed in the many new buildings which have been erected. Most of the new installations however, are oil fired and consequently little trouble from smoke is experienced. Measurement of Deposited Matter and Sulphur Dioxide These forms of pollution are recorded each month by means of apparatus installed on the roof of the British Museum. The apparatus consists of a deposit gauge for collecting rainwater and deposited matter, and a lead peroxide instrument for recording the amount of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The recordings obtained during 1962 were as follows:— Month Rainfall Monthly deposit—Tons per sq. mile Mg. of S03/day collected by 100 sq. cm.of Batch A Pb 02 inches pH value Insoluble matter Soluble matter Total solids January 2.88 4.7 11.64 16.28 27.92 3.63 February 0.39 3.7 6.74 11.74 18.48 4.12 March 1.38 4.3 12.50 7.50 20.00 5.31 April 1.81 4.2 10.57 2.48 13.05 3.42 May 1.50 5.1 12.66 3.99 16.65 2.78 June 0.24 5.5 13.62 5.87 19.49 2.22 July 2.64 5.0 8.59 2.55 11.14 1.76 August 1.65 5.0 7.45 8.15 15.60 1.95 September 3.23 5.3 12.35 4.96 17.31 1.82 October 1.73 5.0 6.68 5.07 11.75 4.70 November 1.50 3.8 8.89 14.26 23.15 5.35 December 1.30 3.8 9.23 3.83 13.06 8.52 Total 20.25 — 120.92 86.68 207.60 45.58 Monthly Average 1.67 4.6 10.08 7.22 17.30 3.80 31 The solid matter expressed in tons falling over the area of Holborn month by month was as follows:— Month Insoluble matter Soluble matter Total solids January 7.38 10.30 17.68 February 4.27 7.43 11.70 March 7.91 4.75 12.66 April 6.69 1.57 8.26 May 8.01 2.53 10.54 June 8.62 3.72 12.34 July 5.44 1.61 7.05 August 4.72 5.16 9.88 September 7.82 3.14 10.96 October 4.23 3.21 7.44 November 5.63 9.03 14.66 December 5.94 2.42 8.26 Daily Measurement of Suspended Matter The Council has apparatus for making daily estimations of smoke installed at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, and at the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, Queen Square. The apparatus consists mainly of an air pump which draws a known volume of air from outside and passes it through a white filter paper. The amount of smoke collected is estimated by comparing the stain on the paper with a calibrated scale of shades. The following recordings were obtained during 1962:— Concentration of smoke—microgrammes per cubic metre.

Smoke Control Areas On 1st December, 1962, the Holborn Smoke Control Order No. 6 became operative, and with it Holborn became the first borough to be completely controlled under the Clean Air Act. To mark the occasion a press conference attended by Sir Keith Joseph, Minister of Housing and Local Government was held on 3rd December, 1962. The Minister congratulated the borough on completing its smoke control programme, when other local authorities were not so far forward. The borough's first smokeless zone was a voluntary one created in 1956 in the area around Lincoln's Inn. In the following year the Clean Air Act came into force and the Council decided that the whole borough should eventually be smoke controlled, the date set for completion being 1968. The fact that the target was reached in half that time reflects great credit upon the department's clerical and technical staff, and also upon the excellent co-operation between the Ministry, the Council, and the general public. Nearly 7,000 private dwellings were inspected of which about a third were considered to require the adaptation of a fireplace. In fact, only about half of that number of applications were received and the total cost of approved works is about £12,000. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 This Act, the Poisons Rules, 1962, and the Poisons List Order, 1952/62, regulate the sale of poisons, and every local authority is required to keep a list of persons who are entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. During the year 1962, 32 applications were received for retention on this Council's list. Two applications were received for entry on the list. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 This Act and the Regulations of 1951, require the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used in connection with certain upholstering and filling processes, and require premises used for the manufacture or storage of rag flock to be licensed. Four premises in the Borough are registered under the Act, but no premises are licensed for the manufacture or storage of rag flock. Housing Acts 1957-1961 The following is a summary of action under the above Acts during the year 1962. Slum Clearance Houses included in clearance areas Nil Houses included in clearance areas and demolished Nil Houses repaired as a result of action under Sees. 9 and 10 Nil Houses made the subject of demolition orders Nil Houses demolished as a result of demolition orders Nil Houses made the subject of closing orders 2 Parts of buildings made the subject of closing orders Nil Parts of buildings closed by undertaking Nil Underground rooms made the subject of closing orders 4 Underground rooms closed by undertaking Nil Closing orders determined Nil No. of flats erected by the Council during the year 21 33 Note: The number of underground rooms which do not comply with the relevant Regulations, but which are occupied for human habitation, is 437. Houses Let in Lodgings Number in Borough 266 Inspections made 50 Overcrowding On the 1st January, 1962, 126 families were known to be living in overcrowded conditions. During the year a further 3 families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions. In 4 cases, overcrowding was abated during the year as follows:— Families rehoused by the Holbom Borough Council 1 Families rehoused by the London County Council 2 Accommodation found by other means 1 During the year 26 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors in connection with conditions of overcrowding. In cases where overcrowding is abated, a warning letter is sent to the owner of the premises drawing attention to the relevant provisions of the Housing Acts. Rent Act, 1957 The following particulars were supplied to the Minister of Housing and Local Government in accordance with Circular No. 32/57 dated 6th June, 1957:— Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (1) Number of applications for certificates Nil (2) Number of decisions not to issue certificates Nil (3) Number of decisions to issue certificates Nil (a) in respect of some but not all defects Nil (b) in respect of all defects Nil (4) Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule Nil (5) Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule Nil (6) Number of certificates issued Nil Applications for Cancellation of Certificates (7) Applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates Nil (8) Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates Nil (9) Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenant's objection Nil (10) Certificates cancelled by Local Authority Nil 34 Rodent Control Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 This Act lays a duty upon a local authority to see that their district is kept free from rats and mice. It empowers them to carry out inspections and to require owners and occupiers to keep their land and premises free from infestation. Occupiers are required to give notification in writing of infestation by rats or mice to the local authority. Report for 12 months ended 31st December, 1962 The following particulars were supplied to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries:— Type of Property Local Authority Dwelling Houses Agricultural All other (including Business and Industrial) Total 1.

There were no cases arising during the year which called for action under the above Acts by the Public Health Department, but visits were made in connection with the voluntary removal of aged and infirm persons living alone, to hospitals or other places and in connection with the provision for such persons of home nursing and home help facilities. Burial of the Dead Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died in the area, or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body are otherwise likely to be made. Such cases are those of persons who die in poor circumstances, and, with few exceptions, have no known relatives. Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have been asked by the Minister to exercise their powers to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of such persons dying in hospital. This Circular does not apply to voluntary hospitals, of which there are two in the Borough, namely the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Italian Hospital, Queen Square. 37 During the year fourteen cases were dealt with, at a total cost of £143 5s. Od. The total mount recovered during the year in respect of burials was £133. The cases had come to the notice of the Public Health Department from the following sources:— Coroner's Officer 2 Friends or Relatives of Deceased 12 New Legislation The Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1962 These Regulations amend Regulation 7 of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1960 (which restricts the preparation and packing of food on domestic premises) by making that Regulation apply to the peeling of onions undertaken for the purposes of food business. The Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, 1962 These Regulations provide a code of management which a local authority may apply by order under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1961 to any house wholly or partly let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, which is in an unsatisfactory condition in consequence of defective management. Oil Heaters Regulations, 1962 These Regulations impose requirements in respect of the construction, design and performance of domestic oil heaters, and make it an offence to sell or have in possession for sale an oil heater not complying with the Regulations. National Assistance Act, 1948 (Amendment) Act, 1962 This Act which came into operation on the 24th May, 1962, substitutes a new Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948 and gives local authorities power to make their own arrangements for the provision of meals and recreation for old people. It also re-enacts the original power of a local authority to contribute to the funds of a voluntary organisation and extends it by enabling the local authority to lend premises, furniture, vehicles and equipment to such an organisation. Milk and Dairies (Preservatives) Regulations, 1962 These Regulations prohibit the addition of any preservative to milk and the sale of any milk to which any such addition has been made. Preservatives in Food Regulations, 1962 These Regulations re-enact with amendments the Public Health (Preservatives, etc. in Food) Regulations 1925 to 1958. Landlord and Tenant Act, 1962 This Act which came into operation on the 1st November, 1962 requires landlords to supply their tenants with rent books or similar documents, and prescribes the information to be contained in rent books. Milk and Dairies (Emulsifiers and Stabilisers) Regulations, 1962 These Regulations prohibit the addition of any emulsifiers and stabilisers to milk and the sale of any milk to which such addition has been made. Emulsifiers and Stabilisers in Food Regulations, 1962 These Regulations prohibit the sale or importation of flour containing any emulsifiers or stabilisers, or of bread or other food containing emulsifiers or stabilisers other than those specified. 38 SECTION 5. Factories. Most of the provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937-1961, are administered by the Ministry of Labour and National Service through H.M. Factory Inspectors. The Sanitary Authority is charged with the duty of enforcing the legislation as to sanitary accommodation in all factories in its area, and, in those factories where mechanical power is not used, legislation with regard to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, and drainage of floors. All factories must have an adequate supply of drinking water from a public main or some other source approved in writing by the Council. Particulars ot inspections and other work carried out during 1962 are as follows:— Number of visits to:— Factories with mechanical power 80 Factories without mechanical power 7 Outworkers registers 5 Outworkers' rooms 4 Electrical stations and sites of building operations 108 Factories Acts, 1937—1959 The following particulars are furnished in accordance with Section 128 (3) of the principal Act, with respect to matters under Part I and Part VIII:— Part I of the Act 1.

Details of the premises are as follows:— Restaurant 4 Licensed Premises 1 Cafe 1 42 The following is a summary of the work carried out during the year as a result of Notices served under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, in respect of food premises: Premises or parts of premises put in sanitary condition 1 Proper lighting and ventilation provided to sanitary conveniences 2 Sanitary conveniences made not to communicate with room used for handling open food 1 Persons handling food:— Wash-hand basins provided 1 Hot and cold water provided 1 Soap, detergents, nail brushes and towels provided 1 Wash basins and traps cleansed 1 Food rooms repaired and put in good condition 1 Registrations The Milk and Dairies Regulations require every Local Authority to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of distributor in their district and of all premises which are used as dairies. "Dairy" does not include a shop from which milk is supplied only in the properly closed and unopened vessels in which it is delivered to the shop, or other place in which milk is sold for consumption on the premises only. "Distributor" includes a purveyor of milk whether by wholesale or retail. Most distributors now sell milk in the bottles and cartons in which they receive it from the wholesaler, and consequently their premises are not required to be registered as dairies. Dairies registered during 1962 Nil Dairies removed from register during 1962 Nil Dairies on register at end of 1962 1 Distributors registered during 1962 2 Distributors removed from register during 1962 1 Distributors on register at end of 1962 49 Inspections made by Inspectors during 1962 4 Formal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 78 Informal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 84 43 The following tables show the monthly variation of the chemical composition of the 162 samples.

Upon being satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with, a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area from which the designated milk is to be sold. A licence is issued for a period of five years and permits the sale of designated milk outside as well as inside the area of the licensing authority. During the year 2 dealers licences were issued, details of which are as follows:— To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 1 To sell Pasteurised milk 2 To sell Sterilised milk 1 Milk—Bacteriological Examination During the year, 106 samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination. 36 of these were from milk supplied to schools in the Borough and four to a Day Nursery. 45 Registration of Premises used for the Manufacture, Storage or Sale of Ice Cream Premises used for the manufacture, storage or sale of ice cream are required by Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, to be registered by the local authority. On the 1st January, 1962, one set of premises was registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, in Holborn, and 140 premises were registered for storage and sale. During the year 3 applications were received and approved in respect of premises to be used for storage and sale of ice cream. One set of premises ceased to be used for the storage and sale of ice cream, and was removed from the register. At the end of the year, there was one registration for manufacture, storage and sale, and 142 premises were registered for storage and sale. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, Etc.) Regulations, 1959 During the year, 71 samples of ice cream were submitted for examination by the Methylene Blue Test. The results in the grading suggested by the Ministry of Health were as follows:— Grade 1 55 Grade 2 12 Grade 3 2 Grade 4 2 In the case of samples falling within Grades 3 and 4, letters were sent to the vendors drawing their attention to the poor grading. In such cases where the ice cream was manufactured outside Holborn, details were also sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas concerned. Licensed Premises There are 74 public houses in the Borough, and during the year 146 inspections were carried out. In addition, 49 reports were submitted to the Licensing Justices, in respect of premises where application had been made for the grant, re-grant or transfer of a licence under the Licensing Acts, 1953 and 1961. 46 Food Sampling A total of 484 samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Borough Analyst for chemical analysis during the year. 276 were formal samples and 208 were informal.

(a) Entrants to the Established Staff. All persons appointed to the established staff are medically examined, unless they are already established local authority officers. In general, non-established staff are first examined as soon as it seems reasonably certain that they will remain in the Council's employ. They are examined again immediately prior to joining the establishment. (b) After sickness. Staff whose sick pay has expired are examined to evaluate the probability of their return to duty. A report is sent to the appropriate committee. (c) Age. Certain staff who wish to continue working after the normal age for retirement are examined to determine their fitness to do so. Motor drivers are examined at the ages of 55 years and 60 years and thereafter annually. The following table gives the numbers and results of examinations conducted during 1962. No. of Examinations Results First examination 74 Fit for employment 91 Second examination 12 Decision deferred 8 Re-examinations of the above 1 Not fit for employment 1 By reason of age 3 A decision is deferred when further observation or investigation of an abnormality is desirable, or to enable the applicant to obtain treatment for a remediable defect. In addition 10 examinations were made of 9 persons who had had long periods of sickness. In all cases the general practitioner was consulted. As a result of these deliberations, one person was considered to be " incapable of discharging the duties of their employment by reason of permanent ill health or infirmity of body." DISABLED DRIVERS. Fifty-eight applications for exemption from parking meter charges were referred by the Borough Engineer for medical opinion, necessitating medical examinations in respect of 37 of these applicants. OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE The register of Elderly Holborn Residents which is kept consists of names supplied by persons and organisations interested in the welfare of the aged. It includes members of Old Peoples' Clubs and those who are visited by other organisations. The remainder are visited regularly by the Social Workers. The state of the register at the end of the year was:— 52 Number on visiting list 348 Number known to be active or members of Clubs 382 Visited by other organisations 172 Total number registered 902 Old people who are fit and well are visited once a year to maintain contact and check the accuracy of the register. Less able people are visited quarterly or monthly. When special difficulties arise more frequent visits are needed. During the year 1,218 home visits were made by the Social Workers, and 692 other visits or interviews on behalf of old people occurred.
