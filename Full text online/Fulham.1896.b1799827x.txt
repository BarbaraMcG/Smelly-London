To the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Annual Report on the vital statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the district for the year 1896. The statistics of Marriages, Births, Deaths, and Infectious Diseases relate to the 53 weeks ending January 2nd, 1897. Population. Under the provisions of the Equalisation of Rates Act a Census of the sanitary districts of the Metropolis was taken on March 29th, 1896, and the returns show that the population of Fulham on that day was 113,781, an increase of 22,141 compared with the enumerated total of 91,640 in 1891, the increase being greater than in any sanitary district in the Metropolis excepting in Wandsworth. Large, however, as has been the increase, it is relatively less than that which took place between 1881 and 1891, in which period the population increased from 42,900 to 91,640; for had this rate of increase been maintained during the past five years the population of Fulham would have numbered 123,168. SEX DISTRIBUTION. There were 60,031 females and 53,950 males, an excess of 6,281 females, being in the proportion of 100 females to 89.7 males. At the previous Census the proportion was 100 females to 87.6 males. The proportion varied considerably in the several wards—thus, in Barons Court Ward there were 100 females to every 64 males, while in Margravine Ward there were 95-3 females to every 100 males, the former ward being inhabited largely by the servant-keeping class. AGE DISTRIBUTION. No particulars as to age were required to be given at the Census, but assuming the age constitution of the population to be the same as in 1891, the following table gives the number of persons living in Fulham at different age periods at the time of the Census:— Under 5 16,043 5 to 15 25,601 15 „ 25 1 9,579 25 „ 35 20,480 35 „ 45 14,450 45 „ 55 8,876 55 „ 65 5,121 65 „ 75 2,730 Over 75 910 113,781 INHABITED HOUSES. The number of inhabited houses on the 29th March was 15,266, giving 7.45 persons to each house; and, in 1891, there were 12,866 houses with 7.1 persons to each house. It will be remembered that the Registrar General takes no notice of flats. For the purposes of the Census each block of flats constitutes one house, whatever number of separate occupations there may be. EMPTY HOUSES. 738 houses, or 4.6 per cent., were returned as empty, while, in 1891, the empty houses numbered 797, or 5.8 per cent. The empty houses were mainly confined to two wards of the parish, viz., Town and Barons Court Wards, no less than 14 per cent, of the houses being empty in the former and 8 per cent, in the latter, while, in the remainder of the parish, only 2.5 per cent. of the houses were empty. HOUSES IN COURSE OF ERECTION. That the population of the parish is still increasing at a rapid rate is shown by the fact that at the time of the Census there were 222 houses in the course of erection. NATURAL INCREASE OF THE POPULATION. During the intercensal period of 5 years there were, in Fulham, 18.376 births and 9,873 deaths, or an excess of registered births over deaths of 8,503. AREA AND DENSITY OF THE POPULATION. The area of Fulham is 1,701 acres, and there are 67 persons to the acre The County of London has an average density of 59. 2 persons to the acre, ranging from 212 and 197 in St. George's, Southwark, and Whitechapel, to 20, 16, and 10, in Wandsworth, Lewisham and Plumstead. The following Table gives a summary of the results of the Census in each of the wards into which the parish is divided, together with the increase in each during the past five years:— Name of Ward. Number of separate families (Schedules) Houses. Population. Population in 1891.

Assuming that the rate of increase which prevailed during between 1891 and 1896 is still maintained, the population at the middle of 1896 was 115,008, and on these figures the statistics in this report are based. Marriages and Marriage Rate. 916 marriages were celebrated in Fulham during the year, the number in the three preceding years being 809, 789, and 735. The marriage rate, i.e., persons married per 1,000 inhabitants, was 15.6, the rate for the whole of London being 18.0, and for England and Wales, 15.3. B Births and Birth Rate. The births registered in the year numbered 4,068, 2,092 males and 1,976 females. There was one birth to every 29.7 inhabitants, and 100 births of males to 94.5 of females. The 4,068 births correspond to a birth-rate of 34.8 per 1,000 of the population which is the lowest birth-rate recorded in Fulham. The rate for the whole of London was 30.2, being also the lowest on record. The following Table gives the number of births registered in Fulham ; together with the birth-rate during the previous 10 years:— Males. Females. Total. Birth Rate. 1886 1395 1285 2680 39.4 1887 1412 1458 2870 39.3 1888 1577 1406 2983 38.2 1889 1567 3089 1522 37.2 1890 1551 1593 3144 35.7 1891 1814 1733 3547 37.4 1892 1835 1761 3596 35.4 1893 1860 1851 3711 35.4 1894 1937 1826 3763 34.9 1895 1993 1937 3930 35.3 1896 1976 4068 34.8 2092 The mean rate for the 10 years being 36.8. The erection during the last four or five years of a considerable number of moderate-sized " flats," tenanted largely by unmarried persons or by those with small families, probably accounts for the diminution of the birth-rate. EXCESS OF BIRTHS OVER DEATHS. The natural increase of the population by excess of births over deaths was 2,025, compared with 1,671, 1,86 6 and 1,735 in three preceding years. ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. The births of illegitimate children numbered 184, 88 males and 96 females, forming 4.5 per cent, of the total births. STILL-BORN CHILDREN. 182 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every 224 births. Deaths and Death Rate. The deaths of 2,375 persons—1,l94 males and 1,181 females —were registered in Fulham during the year, but of these 508 were of persons not belonging to the district who died in public institutions within the parish. while the deaths of 186 persons belonging to Fulham occurred in institutions situated outside the parish. There were, therefore, 2,053 deaths of parish. ioners of Fulham, the mortality being at the rate of 17.5 per 1000 living which is the lowest rate yet recorded in Fulham. The death rate for the whole of London was 18.2, and of the three adjoining parishes—that of Kensington was 16.8, of Hammersmith 17.2, and of Chelsea 18.8. The lowest rates in the 43 sanitary areas into which the Metropolis is divided were 11.9 in Hampstead, 12.7 in Stoke Newington. 13.4 in Lee, 13.6 in St. George's, Hanover Square, 14.3 in Wandsworth and Lewisham, and 15.3 in Paddington, and the highest rates were 22.7 in Strand, 22.8 in St. Saviour's, Southwark, 22.9 in Limehouse, 23.4 in Holborn, 24.0 in St. George's, Southwark, 24.5 in S. George's-in-the-East, and 25.1 in St. Luke's. Among the 33 large towns in England the lowest rates were those of Croydon 14.2, Derby 15.7, West Ham and Brighton 16.1, Huddersfield and Bradford 16.5, Portsmouth 16.6, and Leicester 16.7; and the highest those of Birmingham 20.5, Preston 20.9, Salford 22.5, Manchester 22.6, and Liverpool 22.7. CORRECTION FOR AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION. In comparing the death-rates of different areas due regard must be paid to the differences of age and sex distribution in the population upon which such death-rates are calculated, and the recorded death-rates require correction before they can be used for the purposes of comparison. Corrected for these factors the death-rates of Fulham and the adjoining parishes are as under:— Fulham 18.3 Hammersmith 18.2 Kensington 18.5 Chelsea 20.0 London 19.5 SEASONAL MORTALITY. The mortality in the four quarters of the year was as under:— No. of Deaths. Death Rate. 1st quarter 574 20.0 2nd 456 15.8 3 rd 57 2 19.9 4th 14.5 451 The following Table gives the death-rates of Fulham and of London, uncorrected for age and sex distribution, during the previous 10 years: — Fulham Death-rate per 1,000. London Death-rate per 1,000. 1886 19.0 20.5 1887 19.5 20.3 1888 19.1 19.3 1889 18.8 18.4 1890 21.7 21.4 1891 19.7 21.0 1892 20.0 20.3 1893 19.5 21.0 1894 17.9 17.4 1895 19.9 19.5 1896 17.5 18.2 The average rates for the 10 years being:— Fulham, 19.5, London, 20.1. DISTRIBUTION OF DEATHS. The following Table gives the number of deaths and the death-rate in each of the wards into which the parish is divided:— Number of Deaths. Death-rate. Barons Court Ward 163 13.9 Hurlingham 75 13.3 Lillie 408 19.4 Margravine 385 20. Munster 337 20.4 Sands End 282 17.7 Town 133 14.2 Walham 260 16.4 Not specified - 10 The above must be considered fairly satisfactory, as the highest rate is not greatly in excess of that of the whole parish. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. Infantile Mortality. —Of the 2,053 deaths registered 710 or 34.5 per cent, were those of children under one year of age, and the rate of infant mortality measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to births registered was 175 deaths to 1,000 births as compared with 177, 149 and 187 in the previous three years. The corresponding rate for the whole of London was 161 deaths per 1,000 births, ranging from—123 in Hampstead, 126 in Stoke Newington. 133 in Plumstead and 136 in Lewisham and Lambeth, to 181 in St. George's, Southwark, 184 in Clerkenwell and in Kensington, 193 in the Strand, 194 in Holborn and 213 in St. Saviour's. In the large provincial towns the lowest rates were 135 in Brighton, 142 in Bristol, 143 in Bradford, and 149 in Halifax; and the highest 187 in Leicester, 197 in Birmingham, 199 in Salford and 203 in Preston. In the three adjoining parishes the rates were —Kensington 178, Hammersmith 179, and Chelsea 169. In the summer quarter the Infantile death-rate reached the high figure of 291 deaths to 1,000 births, mainly owing to the excessive mortality from Diarrhœa. Between the ages of 1 and 5 years 341 deaths were registered, so that the deaths of children under the age of 5 numbered 1,051, or 51 per cent, of the total number of deaths. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of 64 8 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at that age, the corresponding rate for the Metropolis being 66.8. DEATHS OF ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. Sixty-six of the children who died before attaining the age of one year were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 358 deaths to 1,000 births, or more than twice as heavy as that of Children born in wedlock. INSURANCE OF INFANTS. Certificates under the Friendly Societies Acts were issued in respect of 581 children under the age of 5 years, and 63 in respect of those between 5 and 10. Thus 55 per cent, of the children who died before attaining the age of 5 were insured. In the previous three years the proportions were 48, 50, and 53 per cent. MORTALITY AT SCHOOL AGE. At the age of 5 to 15 years, which is approximately the school period of life, there were 95 deaths, corresponding to an annual rate of 3.7 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at that age. MORTALITY AT ADOLESCENCE. Between the age of 15 to 25 years 63 deaths were recorded, the rate of mortality being 3.2 per 1000. MORTALITY AT MATURITY. Between the ages of 25 to 65 years there were 600 deaths, corresponding to a death-rate of 12.1. MORTALITY AT DECLINE. At the age of 65 and upwards 244 persons died, the death-rate at this age period being 66.3. DEATHS AND DEATH RATE FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES. 422 deaths were due to the seven principal Zymotic diseases, viz.:— Smallpox - Scarlet Fever 28 Diphtheria 78 Enteric Fever 9 Measles 101 Whooping Cough 68 Diarrhœa 138 422 These 422 deaths correspond to a death-rate of 3.6 per 1,000. During the past 10 years the number of deaths and the death-rate from these diseases have been as under: — Deaths. Death Rate. 1886 2 53 3.7 1867 269 3.6 1888 252 3.2 1889 243 2.9 1890 379 4.3 1891 211 2.3 1892 448 4.6 1893 344 3.3 1894 426 4.0 1895 345 3.1 the average for the 10 years being 3.5. The Zymotic death-rate for the whole of London for the year was 3.1, and the mean for the previous 10 years 2.7. Among the various sanitary areas of the Metropolis the Zymotic deathrates ranged from 1.4 in St. George's, Hanover Square and in the City of London, 1.8 in Hampstead, 1.9 in Lee, 2.2 in Westminster, 2.3 in Stoke Newington, St. Giles, and St. Martin-in-the-Fields, to 3.9 in Chelsea and Woolwich, 4.0 in Limehouse, 4.2 in St. George's, Southwark and Bethnal Green, 4.3 in Shoreditch and 4.8 in St. Olave, Southwark. Among the large provincial towns the lowest rates were those of Halifax 1.1, Swansea 1.2, Bradford 1.6, Brighton 1.7, Blackburn 1.8, and Preston 1.9, and the highest those of West Ham, Sunderland, and Liverpool 3.0, Wolverhampton and Gateshead 3.1, Manchester 3.4, Birmingham 3.6, and Salford 4.1. The following Table shows the mortality from Zymotic diseases in Fulham as compared with London and the three adjacent parishes:— Actual number of deaths in Fulham. Fulham's proportion if mortality was the same as in London. Fulham's proportion if mortality was the same as in 3 adjoining Western districts viz., Hammersmith, Chelsea 4 Kensington Disease. Smallpox 0 0.2 0 Scarlet Fever 28 26 2 5 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 78 70 74 Enteric Fever 16 9 12 Measles 9 8 101 107 Whooping Cough 68 77 70 Diarrhœa 138 84 66 But in considering these figures the relative proportion of children under 15 in the respective population must be taken into consideration, as all these diseases, with the exception of Enteric Fever and Smallpox, are mainly fatal to young children. In Fulham 26.6 per cent, of the population are under the age of 15 years, whereas in London and the other western districts under consideration, the respective proportions are: 22.4 and 20.1 per cent., and the death-rates from Zymotic Diseases, excluding Enteric Fever and Smallpox, per 1,000 of those estimated to be living under the age of 15 years were:— Fulham 13.3 London 13.4 Three adjoining Western Districts 14.5 LOCALISED ZYMOTIC DEATH RATES. The Zymotic death-rate in the several wards of the parish was as under:— No. of Deaths from Zymotic Diseases. Death Rate from Zymotic Diseases.

Two cases were notified in a house in Jerdan Place. In the first case the disease was contracted in Kensington where the patient had been living up to the time of his illness. The second patient—unlike the other inmates of the house—refused to be vaccinated. SCARLET FEVER. 627 cases were notified of this disease, an increase of 288 cases as compared with last year. The disease was especially prevalent during the latter half of the year, the number of cases in the four quarters of the year being— 1st quarter 65 cases. 2nd „ 122 „ 3rd „ 219 „ 4th „ 221 „ There were 5*4 cases per 1,000 as compared with 5-6 per 1,000 in the neighbouring parishes of Chelsea, Hammersmith, and Kensington, and 5-8 in London. The distribution of the cases was as under:— Cases for 1,000 of the population Cases Deaths Barons Court Ward 29 2.4 - Hurlingham „ 4.6 25 1 Lillie „ 5.6 174 7 Margravine „ 7.2 6 140 Munster „ 76 4.6 6 Sands End „ 117 7.4 4 Town „ 54 5.7 2 Walham „ 72 4.5 2 392, or 6.25 per cent, of those suffering from the disease were removed to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Mortality.—The disease was the cause of 28 deaths, representing a case mortality of 4.4 per cent., as compared with an average of 6.0 per cent, for the previous three years. Of the 392 removed to the Hospitals 20, or 5.1 per cent., and of the 235 who remained at home, 8 or 3.4 per cent. died. ACCOMMODATION AT THE HOSPITALS OF THE MANAGERS OF THE METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD. As has been the case for the last four years the accommodation for Scarlet Fever patients in the Hospitals of the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board was quite inadequate to meet the demands made upon it, and a number of patients remained at home, although their removal was desirable, thus while 80 per cent, of those notified during the first six months of the year were removed, only 50 per cent, of those notified during the latter half of the year could be accommodated in the hospitals. There were on many days after the end of June as many as from 10 to 15 patients in the parish who could not be removed owing to the hospitals being full, and, as in the majority of these cases efficient isolation was quite impossible, it was not surprising that the disease was unduly prevalent. In my report for 1895, I commented on the fact that the Managers of the Asylums Board persisted in having the selection of patients for the beds becoming vacant daily by deaths or discharges made by the officers employed in the Ambulance Department of the Board, instead of consulting with the Medical Officers of Health for the several districts, who were in a position to know the circumstances and surroundings of all the patients notified to them as suffering from infectious diseases, and could therefore form an opinion as to which were really the most urgent cases; and during 1896 they continued the same method, but by requiring more particulars respecting each case whose removal was requested, and exercising apparently more judgment, the arrangement worked more satisfactorily than has hitherto been the case, though I am still of opinion that the selection of cases should, for the reasons I have stated, be as far as possible left to the local officials. Although the accommodation has been insufficient, the Managers of the Asylums Board have made considerable efforts to meet the growing demands of the Metropolis for adequate hospital accommodation, and while, six years ago, the Board's normal accommodation for fever patients did not amount to more than 2,100 beds in five acute and one convalescent hospital the existing accommodation is as follows: — For Fever and Diphtheria — Beds. Eastern Hospital 410 North-Eastern „ 400 North-Western „ 45 6 Western „ 390 South-Western „ 370 Fountain „ 426 South-Eastern 431 Brooks „ 576 3459 950 Northern Hospital for Convalescent Cases 4409 In addition to these the Board are erecting:— Beds. The Park Hospital at Hither Green, to be opened in 1897 540 The Grove Hospital at Tooting, to be opened in 1898 520 Additional buildings at the North-Eastern and Western Hospitals 200 The Board have also secured a site for a Convalescent Hospital at Carshalton, in which they propose to provide for 700 convalescent patients, so that, in a short time, there will be 6,369 beds for Fever and Diphtheria, viz., 4,719 for acute, 1,650 for convalescent cases. For Small-pox the existing accommodation is: — Beds. Hospital Ships 300 Gore Farm Upper Hospital (now occupied by convalescent Scarlet Fever patients) 1000 Gore Farm Lower Hospital 192 149 2 An additional Small-pox Hospital is to be built on the Joyce Green Estate with 400 beds. RETURN CASES. In five instances the disease occurred within 10 days of the return of another member of the family from a hospital after another attack. I drew special attention to the occurrence of these so-called "return cases" in the report for 1895, but they have been much less numerous during the past year than has been the case hitherto. DIPHTHERIA. This disease was again very prevalent in the parish and 341 cases of Diphtheria and 14 of Membranous Croup which is identical with Laryngeal Diphtheria, were notified during the year, as against 250, 342 and 386 in the three preceding years. The distribution of the cases was as follows:— No. of Cases No. of Cases per 1000 of population Deaths Barons Court Ward 16 1.3 1 Hurlingham „ 7 1.2 1 Lillie „ 61 3.0 12 Margravine „ 51 2.7 12 Munster „ 77 4.6 20 Sands End „ 92 6.4 21 Town „ 14 1.5 4 Walham „ 37 2.4 7 78 355 3.0 195 of those certified to be suffering from the disease were removed to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and 14 to other Hospitals, or in all 59 per cent of those notified. The disease was most prevalent in the early part of the year, the cases notified and the deaths occurring in the several quarters being— No. of Cases Deaths 1st Quarter 135 3 6 2nd „ 64 10 3 rd „ 78 19 4th „ (14 weeks) 78 15 Mortality.—The disease was the cause of 78 deaths, giving a case mortality of 22 per cent ,as compared with 26.1 per cent, in 1893, 31.6 per cent, in 1894, and 20 per cent, in 1895. Of the 209 removed to Hospital 48 or 23.0 per cent., and of 146 treated in their own homes, 30 or 20.5 per cent. died. The following Table gives the fatality at different age-periods of the cases treated at home and of those treated in Hospital:— Cases removed to Hospital Cases treated at home Age No. of Cases Deaths Mortality per cent.

This year it will be seen that the fatality of Hospital cases has risen to 23.5 per cent., but it is still considerably below what it was prior to the introduction of Anti-toxin, while the fatality of cases treated at home has fallen to below 20 per cent. Anti-toxin has, however, been used to a much greater extent in private practice, than was the case in 1895. It will be noticed too that the proportion of adults, in whom the disease is much less fatal than in Children, is larger among those treated at home than among those removed to Hospitals. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION. The accommodation provided at the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for patients suffering from Diphtheria was at times during the year insufficient, and in several instances patients could not be promptly removed. In those cases the Board sent a letter stating that the patient could not be admitted, and with the letter, a warrant entitling the Medical Attendant to receive from the Board a supply of "Anti-toxin." But it would be certainly advisable, as Diphtheria is a much more fatal disease than Scarlet Fever, for the Managers to provide more accommodation for patients suffering from Diphtheria, even if, by so doing, they would have to reduce the number of beds at their disposal for cases of Scarlet Fever, as delay in the removal of those suffering from the former disease, especially when surgical interference is needed, deprives them of what little chance there may be of recovery, besides increasing the risk of the spread of the more deadly disease. The Vestry wrote to the Managers and strongly urged them to adopt this course, but up to the present time they have not done so. SCHOOL INFLUENCE. The following Table gives the number of children attending the Board and other primary schools in Fulham, who were notified in each month as suffering from Diphtheria:— School. Jan. Feb. Mar. April May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec.

Errors in Diagnosis.—Of 125 patients admitted to the Western Fever Hospital certified to be suffering from Diphtheria, 16 or 12-8 per cent, were found, after sojourn in Hospital, to be suffering from other diseases, viz., 11 from Tonsillitis, three from Scarlet Fever, and two from other diseases. COMPARATIVE PREVALENCE OF DIPHTHERIA IN FULHAM. Nearly all the sanitary districts of the Metropolis suffered in common with Fulham from an excess of Diphtheria, and the death-rate from the disease in Fulham, viz., 0.66, was but slightly higher from that of the Metropolis, which was 0.59. Among London sanitary areas the lowest death-rates from Diphtheria were 0.12 in the Strand, 0.18 in St. Giles, 0.21 in Wandsworth; and the highest 0.83 in Limehouse, 0.84 in Bermondsey, 0.86 in Mile End, 0.88 in Lewisham, 0.91 in Plumstead, 1.01 in Camberwell and 1.17 in Chelsea. The following Table gives the rate of incidence of Diphtheria in Fulham, London and the adjoining parishes for the past six years:— Cases notified per 10,000 Inhabitants. 1891. 1899. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. Average Fulham 7.1 10.3 22.1 31.5 34.0 30.3 22.5 London 14.2 18.5 30.2 24.4 24.5 31.2 23.8 Kensington 11.1 10.4 21.4 16.1 21.8 27.4 18.0 Hammersmith 29.2 27.5 26.5 17.4 18.3 26.5 24.2 Chelsea 18.0 17.4 23.1 25.6 33.0 57.2 29.1 The following Table gives the Death-rates from Diphtheria per 1000 living in Fulham, London and the three adjacent parishes during the ten years 1887 —1896: — 1887 1888 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 Average for 10 yrs.

Fifty-three cases were notified, the numbers for the three preceding years being 58, 37 and 57, and the disease was the cause of 9 deaths, the case mortality being 15.7 per cent. The death-rate from Enteric Fever was in Fulham 0.08, in London 0.13, in Kensington 0.09, in Chelsea 0.10 and in Hammersmith 0.12. CONTINUED FEVER. Five certificates were received respecting persons alleged to be suffering from Continued Fever. PUERPERAL FEVER. Nine cases were notified of which 3 proved fatal, being in the proportion of 0.7 deaths to 1000 births. CHOLERA. Two persons were certified as suffering from Cholera, but in neither case was there any reason to believe that the disease was other than what is known as English Cholera. ERYSIPELAS. Ninety-nine cases of this disease were notified, and it was the cause of 5 deaths. Deaths from Non-Notifiable Zymotic Diseases. MEASLES. This disease was epidemic in the Metropolis during the early months of the year, and was the cause of 101 deaths in Fulham, the average number allowing for the increase of population for the preceding 10 years being 113. The death-rates from the disease were:— Fulham 0.86 London 0.82 Kensington 1.00 Hammersmith 0.58 Chelsea 1.12 The disease was most prevalent in the Southern part of the parish, the distribution of the deaths being as follows: — Baron's Court Ward 2 Hurlingham „ 6 Lillie „ 10 Margravine „ 14 Munster „ 17 Sands End „ 25 Town „ 7 Walham „ 20 It will be noticed by reference to Table D in the appendix, that the deaths from Measles considerably exceed those from Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever combined, and, consequently, the question of adding Measles to the list of diseases which are compulsorily notified, has been much discussed. I dealt with this question in the report for 1894, and then expressed the opinion that, at any rate, a modified system of notification of Measles should be tried, by which the first attack in every house invaded shall be notified, but no subsequent case arising in the same house within 30 days, and the report of Dr. Thomson on the " Control of Measles," recently issued in the Report of the Medical Officer to the Local Government Board, which is too lengthy to be dealt with here, confirms me in that view. I would also again draw attention to the necessity of providing hospital accommodation for the children of the poor when suffering from Measles ■ not so much on the ground of the necessity for isolation, but for the sake of the welfare of the patients, as a large proportion of those who succumb to the disease would be saved, if they could be removed from the unfavourable conditions by which they are surrounded, and treated in a rational manner. The wide differences noted in the fatality of epidemics of Measles depend mainly on the conditions, unfavourable or the reverse, of the populations invaded. lam convinced that hospital accommodation for the treatment of Measles would have a marked effect in lessening the great mortality from the disease. WHOOPING COUGH. 68 deaths were attributed to this disease, all being of children under 5 years, the average number for the preceding 10 years, allowing for the increase of population, being 63. The disease was most prevalent in the centre of the parish, 42 of the deaths occurring in Lillie and Munster Wards. The death-rates from this disease were Fulham 0.59, London 0.65 Kensington 0.57, Hammersmith 0-58, Chelsea 0.64. [C] DIARRHŒA. Under the heading Diarrhœa are included several different affections confounded with one another on account of the presence of Diarrhœa as a symptom, but there is no doubt that Summer Diarrhœa, to which nearly all the deaths were due, is essentially a specific disease. 138 deaths were registered from Diarrhœa, the average for the previous 10 years, allowing for the increase of population, being 120. In addition to these deaths the majority of the deaths of infants, 50 in number, ascribed to Gastro-Enteritis or Gastro-Enteric Catarrh, were of the same nature; in fact it would be advisable for all these deaths to be reckoned under the head of Diarrhœa for comparative purposes, as some practitioners seldom return a death as due to Diarrhoea, but nearly always to Gastro-Enteritis, so that the number of deaths in a district really due to Diarrhœa may be much understated. The disease, as usual, was markedly in excess in Fulham as compared with London and the adjacent parishes, the death-rates from it being for Fulham 1.15, London 0.72, Kensington 0.35, Hammersmith 0.80 and Chelsea 0.67; that of Fulham being only exceeded by 4 of the Metropolitan sanitary areas, viz., St. Luke 1.23, St, George-in-the-East 1.24, Clerkenwell 1.31, and St. olave 143; and by 4 of the large provincial towns, viz., Liverpool, 1.16, Birmingham 1.20, Salford 1.23, and Leicester 1.35. 116 of the deaths occurred in the months of July and August, and the death rate for the summer quarter was 4.05. As is always the case nearly all the infants who died were hand fed, and there can be no doubt that a large proportion of the deaths was due to the carelessness or ignorance of the persons in charge of the children. Thus during July and August the deaths of illegitimate children under one year were in the proportion of 735 deaths to 1,000 births, more than half the deaths being due to Diarrhœa —in other words, the death-rate of illegitimate children from Diarrhœa alone was much higher than that of children born in wedlock from all causes. Most of these children are put out to nurse, and there is at present insufficient supervision both over the homes in which they are kept, and the persons in whose care they are placed. A Bill, however, entitled "The Infant Life Protection Bill" has been introduced into the House of Lords. The Bill provides for the notification to the local authority by all persons receiving more than one child under the age of five years, the local authority to have the power of inspection and supervision. Notice to the local authority is to be given where more than one child is retained for more than 48 hours, and notice is to be given of any transfer of such children to the care of other persons. Inspectors (male and female) are to be appointed with the usual powers of entry, who are to inspect the premises and children to satisfy themselves "as to the proper maintenance of such children," and "to give any necessary advice or directions as to such maintenance." The local authority is to prescribe the number of infants to be received into any house, and where the premises are "so unfit as to endanger health," or the receiver of such infants " by reason of negligence, ignorance, or other cause," is unfit to have the care of children, the infants are to be removed to the workhouse. The Coroner of the district is to be notified of the death of every such infant, and is to hold an inquest thereon unless a satisfactory medical certificate be produced. For an offence under the Act a penalty not exceeding £5 is provided, with the alternative of imprisonment for not more than 6 months at the discretion of the Court. This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, and it is to be hoped that the Bill will speedily become law. I have in other reports drawn the attention of the Vestry to the necessity for the more frequent removal, in summer, of house and other refuse, and I would again strongly urge this upon them, as it is the contamination of milk and other food with the emanations from decaying refuse and polluted soil that so often causes fatal Diarrhœa. INFLUENZA. Thirteen deaths were directly attributed to Influenza as compared with 25, 13 and 66 in the three preceding years. VENEREAL DISEASES. Fifteen deaths were attributed to these diseases, of which 13 were due to Congenital Syphilis. Class III.— Dietetic Diseases. Five deaths were stated to be directly due to alcoholic excess, but in 12 cases the disease was stated to have been accelerated by intemperance. Class IV.—Constitutional Diseases. The deaths from diseases in this group numbered 431, being 21 per cent, of the total number of deaths. Of these, 193 were due to Phthisis and 111 to other tubercular diseases, as Tubercular Meningitis, Tabes Mesenterica and General Tuberculosis, these diseases thus accounting for 14.7 per cent, of the deaths from all causes, and it is probable that many of the deaths ascribed to Marasmus, Debility and Convulsions were also of a Tubercular nature. The death-rate from Phthisis was for Fulham 1.66, for London 1.88, for Kensington 1.42, for Hammersmith 1.40 and for Chelsea 1.82. 103 deaths were registered from Cancer, 68 being of persons of 45 years and upwards. Rheumatic Fever was responsible for three deaths, and Chronic Rheumatism and Gout for four. Class V.—Developmental Diseases. From diseases of this class 161 deaths were registered, 90 being of infants from premature birth and atelectasis, or non-inflation of the lungs, and 62 deaths were returned as due to " old age." Class VI.—Local Diseases. The diseases of this group were responsible for 830 deaths or 40.4 per cent, of the total number, the following being the principal classes: — I. —DISEASES OF NERVOUS SYSTEM. From these there were 186 deaths, 62 being from Apoplexy, 14 from Insanity and General Paralysis of the Insane, and 41 from Convulsions. 2.- DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS. 105 deaths were ascribed to diseases of the circulatory system. 3. DISEASES OF RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. From these diseases, Phthisis being excluded, there were 350 deaths, or 17 per cent, of the deaths from all causes being 115 below the average for the last 3 years allowing for the increase in population. Of these Pneumonia was responsible for 154, and Bronchitis for 186 deaths. 4.- DISEASES OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. Fifteen deaths were registered in this class, 9 being due to diseases of parturition. The total number of deaths recorded as occurring within 21 days of childbirth was 17, the causes assigned being— Septic Diseases 3 Flooding and other accidents of childbirth 8 Puerperal Convulsions 1 Pneumonia 3 Heart Disease 1 Cystitis 1 17 or one death to 238 births. From the other classes of Local Diseases there were 131 deaths. Class VII.—Deaths from Violence. Different forms of violence caused 62 deaths. ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE. Fractures and Contusions 20 Burns 6 Drowning 2 Suffocation Infants in Bed 19 Otherwise 1 Other Injuries 4 — 52 SUICIDE. Cut, Stab 3 Poison 3 Drowning 1 Hanging 2 9 HOMICIDE. Manslaughter 1 1 62 Class VIII.—Ill-Defined and Not Specified Causes. Under this heading there were 104 deaths, the great majority, viz., 100, being certified as due to Debility, Inanition, or Marasmus. Certification of the Causes of Death. Of the 2053 deaths registered. 1917, or 93.42 per cent., were duly certified by registered medical practitioners, and 135, or 6.43 percent., by the Coroner after inquest, while the causes of 3, or 0.15 per cent., were uncertified. Inquests. Of the 133 inquests held on parishioners, 118 were held in the parish, and 15 at institutions outside. The subjects were, males 85, females 48; and their ages— Under 5 59 5 to 60 52 Over 60 22 71 deaths were due to natural causes and 62 to violence. Those due to natural causes may be classified as follows:— Zymotic Diseases 6 Tubercular - Diseases of Respiratory Organs 15 Diseases of Circulatory System 19 Convulsions and other Diseases of the Nervous System 12 Alcoholism 3 Other Diseases 15 Cause not ascertained 1 71 The deaths due to violence have already been classified. Uncertified Deaths. Two of these were of prematurely born infants who only lived a few hours; and the other was ascribed to Phthisis. The proportion of uncertified deaths was, in London, 0.9 per cent., and in England and Wales per cent. Deaths in Public Institutions. FULHAM UNION INFIRMARY AND WORKHOUSE. This institution, situated in Fulham, serves for the two Parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith. 473 deaths occurred in the Infirmary and 28 in the Workhouse; of these 257 were of parishioners of Fulham, and 244 of persons belonging to Hammersmith. Their ages and causes of death will be found in Table A. WESTERN FEVER HOSPITAL. 304 deaths occurred at the Western Fever Hospital. Of these 47 were of Parishioners, and 257 of persons belonging to other districts. Their ages and causes of death will be found in Table A. Of the 2053 deaths registered, 470, or 22.8 per cent., took place in public institutions, the proportion in London being 28.3 per cent. The percentages in the several classes of institutions were as under:— Fulham London In Workhouses and Workhouse Infirmaries 12.7 13.6 per cent. In Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals 3.0 2.2 In other Hospitals 5.7 10.4 In public Lunatic and Imbecile Asylums 1.4 2.1 DEATHS OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT AMONG PERSONS BELONGING THERETO. The deaths of parishioners at public institutions and elsewhere outside the parish numbered and occurred in the following places:— No of Deaths of Parishioners of Fulham.

Inquests were held on 118, and post-mortem examinations were made in 74 of the above cases. Vaccination. The following Tables, furnished by Mr. Collins, the Vaccination Officer, give the Vaccination returns for 1895, and for the first six months of 1896, those for the last six months not being yet complete:— SUPPLEMENTAL RETURN FOR 1895 FOR THE PARISH OF FULHAM. No. of Births Registered from 1st Jan., 1895, to 31st Dec., 1895. Insusceptible of Vaccination. Had Small Pox. Dead. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Outstanding. Successfully Vaccinated. Removed. 3125 19 - 465 274 19 49 395 1 RETURN OF VACCINATION FOR THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY TO JUNE 1896, PARISH OF FULHAM. No. of Birth Registered from 1st Jan., to 30th June, 1896 Successfully Vaccinated Insusceptible of Vaccination Had Small Pox Dead Postponed by Medical Certificate Outstanding Removed 2017 - 9 1559 18 220 5 1 160 The returns for 1895 is of a satisfactory nature showing that only 7.4 per cent, of the children remain unaccounted for, as compared with 8 per cent, in 1894 and 10 per cent, in 1893. REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON VACCINATION. The report of the Royal Commission on Vaccination which was appointed as far back as 1889 was issued last year. The report cannot be dealt with fully here but briefly it may be said that it unhesitatingly upholds the contention of the vast majority of the medical profession as to the value of vaccination. The conclusions of the Commissioners as to vaccination are: That it diminishes the liability to be attacked by the disease; That the protection it affords is greatest during the years immediately succeeding the operation of vaccination and that though after the lapse of some 9 or 10 years the protective agency diminishes it still remains considerable, and possibly never altogether ceases. The Commissioners, however, recommend that the law relating to infantile vaccination shall be relaxed and consider that conscientious objectors should be let off by making a declaration before a Magistrate of their objections, but hold that this need not result in a diminution of vaccination but rather the reverse. They also make a number of recommendations with regard to the manner of performing the operation the most important of which are:— That calf lymph shall be available for all vaccinations though not to the exclusion of human if demanded. That the age shall be extended from 3 to 6 or even 12 months provided that the earlier age be reverted to if Small-pox appears in the community. That the operation be performed and the arm subsequently inspected at the child's own home, instead of at the vaccination station. That vaccination shall be postponed should the child be living in an insanitary house, or if Erysipelas, Scarlet Fever. Measles, or Chicken-pox prevail near the residence or place of vaccination. That medical attendance required in consequence of vaccination shall be charged to the state. Removal of the child from insanitary surroundings while it is under vaccination is also recommended, if practicable. Disinfection. Infected articles were disinfected by the contractor, Mr. Lacy, Townmead Wharf, by whom the articles were also collected. The weight of the articles disinfected was 1,224 cwt., and the amount paid by the Vestry to Mr. Lacy, £765 10s. 6d. During the last four years the Vestry have paid for disinfecting infected articles, £3,172, or an average of £793 a year. The advisability of providing a disinfecting station of their own has been frequently brought under the notice of the Vestry, and I trust that this year one will be definitely arranged for, as I think the Vestry are fully agreed that for economical, as well as for other reasons, this course is most desirable. SHELTER. I have again to report that no shelter has yet been provided for the use of persons during the period necessary for the disinfection of their dwellings, but hope that the Vestry will provide this at the same time as they put up their disinfecting plant. As, owing to the want of a shelter, it is not possible where persons inhabit only one room, to disinfect the room by the usual process of fumigation with Sulphurous Acid Gas, then washing with a solution of corrosive sublimate and stripping the walls, the Vestry purchased an " Equifex Sprayer," by which a room can be sprayed with a solution of corrosive sublimate without disturbing the occupiers, and this has been found useful in oneroomed tenements, where there have been cases of infectious disease. Water Supply. This has been satisfactorily maintained throughout the year by both the Companies, the Chelsea and West Middlesex, which supply the district, and no complaints of deficient service were received. The Companies have lowered the mains which were laid at an insufficient depth, and were frozen during the severe winter of 1895. QUALITY OF THE WATER. No samples were taken by the Vestry for analysis. Dr. Frankland's report on the Metropolitan Water Supply shows that the Thames water distributed during 1896 was somewhat inferior to that delivered during the previous year, but as showing how efficient is the method of filtration practised by the Water Companies, Dr. Frankland states that the amount of suspended matter in the efficiently filtered river water supplied to the Metropolis, rarely, if ever, exceeds 0.002 grains in a tumbler full, and, therefore, in order to imbibe a single grain it would be necessary for the consumer to drink no less than 5,000 tumblers full of the water. Sewer Ventilation. Many complaints have, as usual, been received of the offensive smells arising from the manholes and surface ventilators. The Vestry have, however, been dealing vigorously with the nuisance. A survey of the parish has been made by the Surveyor in order to ascertain the most suitable sites for the erection of ventilating shafts and the owners of these houses have been requested to allow the Vestry to erect shafts against them, but unfortunately they have not been found to respond as readily as could be wished, and great difficulty has been experienced in getting the required permission; but in spite of this some 50 shafts have been erected during the year, and the work is still being proceeded with, but compulsory powers should certainly be given to local authorities to erect ventilating shafts in suitable positions. NUISANCE CAUSED BY THE VENTILATORS OF THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL SEWERS. Numerous complaints were received concerning the offensive smells emitted from the ventilators of the new sewer which has been recently constructed by the London County Council between Hammersmith Road and Melmoth Place, and as no notice was taken by the Council of remonstrances and notices, the Vestry, after carefully considering reports on the matter, issued summonses against the Council under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for not complying with their notices to abate a nuisance caused by the emission of sewer gas from the sewer ventilators at the junction of Hartismere and Dawes Road and in Melmoth Place. The case was heard at the Kensington Petty Sessions when it was admitted on behalf of the Council that the nuisance existed, but it was argued that the Public Health (London) Act did not apply to public sewers constructed by the London County Council and that the Bench had no jurisdiction to deal with the nuisance. The Bench upheld this view and dismissed the summons with £5 ss. costs. Against this decision the Vestry appealed, and the Bench having refused to state a case, the Superior Court has made a rule and directed the Kensington Justice to state a special case for their consideration. Combined Drainage. The Bill to amend the Metropolis Management Act in respect of the definition of the words "drain" and "sewer" has made no progress, and there seems to be but little chance at present of its becoming law, and, as I anticipated, the Vestry have been put to a considerable expense in relaying the defective drains of houses drained by a combined operation, which, in consequence of the combination not having been approved by the local authority, are sewers within the meaning of the Metropolis Management Acts. During the year the drains of 75 houses were relaid by the Vestry, and in all probability that number will be considerably exceeded this year. That the law as it at present stands is most inequitable cannot be questioned, as several cases have occurred where the plans originally submitted by the builders to the local authority showed separate drainage, but it has been found that, instead of this being the case, two or more houses are drained by a single drain which thus becomes a "sewer" within the meaning of the Act, and repairable by the Vestry, so that the honest builder who laid the drains of his houses in accordance with the plans he submitted has to bear the cost of keeping his drains in repair, while his more unscrupulous neighbour, who hoodwinked the local authority, now escapes scot free, and has his property put in a sanitary condition at the expense of the ratepayers. It must, however, be remembered that this state of things has arisen from the neglect of the local authority to exercise a proper supervision, in accordance with their duty, over the buildings that were being erected in the district. If the Fulham District Board of Works and the Fulham Vestry in its early days had employed a sufficient staff, in doing which they would spend a comparatively trifling sum, the present ratepayers would have been saveJ an expenditure of some thousands. Supervision of New Property. In a report made to the Vestry on the report of Dr. Young, Assistant Medical Officer of Health, on the Sanitary Conditions and Administration of the Parish of Fulham, I remarked— The next matter dealt with by Dr. Young is the general structure and conditions of the houses in Fulham, and this is perhaps the most important feature in the report. Dr. Young says:—"A marked feature which attracted attention in this district is the inferior character of the building which has taken place in some parts. Houses which I found had only been built within recent years were already becoming defective, owing apparently to the inferior quality of material used in their construction and to inferior workmanship," and he then gives some typical examples. As to the absolute correctness of these remarks there can be no question, as most of the members of the Committee are well aware. In fact it may be said that a very large proportion of the sanitary defects in Fulham are due to the original faulty construction of the houses. And for this state of things it must be borne in mind the sanitary authority in Fulham are in no way responsible, as it is due to the way in which the Building Act has been administered, formerly by the Metropolitan Board of Works and of late years by the London County Council. I regret, too, to have to say that even with the more stringent Building Act of i 894 things are now but little better; at the present moment houses are being erected in Fulham in such a manner that it is almost certain that in a very few years they will be in a ruinous condition, and I have reported to the Council some recent violations of the Building Act in respect of open space at the rear of houses, a point which is also alluded to by Dr. Young as having been neglected in the past. This report of the Council's own officer is a strong argument in favour of the transfer of many of the powers possessed by the London County Council under the Building Act to the local authority, and I would strongly urge the Vestry to endeavour to secure the transfer of these powers, which was, I believe, recommended by the recent Conference of local authorities, seeing how they are suffering from the shortcomings of the central authority who now sit in judgment on them. On this report being sent to the Council they requested that I would furnish them with some instances of contravention of the Building Act in support of my statement. In reply to this I forwarded particulars of cases in which the Act had been contravened in respect of the open space at the rear of buildings, which had already been reported to the Council, and also instanced some houses which had just been erected in Field Road and Chelmsford Street, as justifying my remarks, that houses were being at the present time erected, which would, in a few years, be in a ruinous condition, and, in reply to a further request for specific details of the defects, I forwarded a list of some seventy defects which were already to be noticed in these houses- The houses were then inspected by the Council's officers, who reported that the majority of the admitted defects did not come within the scope of the Building Act, and with regard to those that did, the Building Act Committee of the Council reported that they were advised that it was too late for the Council to take any action with reference to the houses in question, but they informed the Vestry " that in the event of its coming to the knowledge of the Vestry that improper materials, such as brickwork, mortar and plastering, are being used in the construction of buildings, the strictest attention shall be paid to the matter if the Vestry will be good enough to send an intimation to the Council while the work is in progress," and since then I have drawn the attention of the Council to some houses in which this appeared to me to be the case. It is, however, pretty clear from the fact that a very small proportion of the admitted defects in these houses came within the scope of the Building Act, that this Act is not sufficient to prevent even the worst forms of "jerrybuilding." In my last report I expressed the opinion that the County Council should have power to make a bye-law to the effect " That a person shall not let nor occupy any new dwelling house until such dwelling house shall, after examination, have been certified by an officer of the sanitary authority authorised to give such certificate, to be, in his opinion, in every respect fit for human habitation." The matter has been under the consideration of the Public Health Committee of the Council, who recommended the Council to apply to Parliament for powers to make this bye-law and the report was adopted by the Council, but the Parliamentary Committee, in whose hands the draughting of Bills lies, were advised by the Parliamentary Agent that there would be but little chance of the Council being able to get a bill to this effect through Parliament, consequently it was determined not to proceed with the matter during the present Session. Prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and Metropolis Local Management Acts. Prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Metropolis Local Management Acts, were instituted by the Vestry in the following cases:— Defendant Offence Result Failing to comply with order of the Magistrate to abate nuisance Fined £10 10s.

The following samples were taken for analysis during the year:— Article No. of Samples No. adulterated Milk 63 5 Butter 36 4 Coffee 9 - Infusion of Coffee 11 - Pepper 7 - Muscard 7 - Lard 2 - Vinegar 2 - Whisky 5 - Preserved Peas 4 3 Sweets 2 - Sweet Spirits of Nitre 2 - Paregoric 3 - Tincture of Quinine 1 - Liquorice Powder 1 - Ground Ginger 1 - 156 12 From the above Table it will be seen that the proportion of adulterated samples was only 7.6 per cent, of those examined, which is the lowest percentage of adulteration recorded in Fulham. One sample was obtained for every 737 of the population, as compared with one for every 414 persons in London in 1895. PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. Defendant. Offence.

Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. The following houses were represented to the Sanitary Authority under the provisions of the above Act as being in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation:— Description of Premises 61 & 63, Aspenlea Road 57, 59, 61 & 63, Star Road 9, Suffolk Street Cottage at rear of Portland Rd. 16, 18, 20 & 22, Ewald Road 15, Humbolt Road 1-8, Carlton Mews Number of Dwellings 2 4 1 1 4 1 8 20 Action taken Repaired by Owner „ „ „ „ Closed by Owner Repaired by Owner „ „ Now being repaired The following Table gives a summary of the action taken under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, in the last four years.

Certificates under Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, 1890 and 1891. Certificates for exemption from Inhabited House Duty were granted in respect of 38 houses and refused in respect of 45. Baths and Washhouses Acts. The Vestry, in November, 1895, resolved that the Baths and Washhouses Act, 1846 (9 & 10 Vict., cap. 74), and the Acts amending the same, be adopted for the Parish of Fulham, but it is to be regretted that beyond the appointment of Commissioners nothing has yet been done to carry the Act into effect. These are unquestionably much wanted in Fulham, and should be provided without further delay. It has been argued that they are not required because most of the houses in the parish are provided with baths, but this is a mistaken notion, as the majority of the houses in the older portion of the parish are without baths, and at the present time a large number of houses are being erected intended for two families, which are not provided with them. Average London has not yet reached any high standard of sensibility to dirt, and anything which will tend to raise that standard should certainly be promoted. I trust, therefore, that the Vestry will not stultify themselves, but will, without further delay, erect suitable baths and washhouses in some easily accessible part of the parish. House Refuse. The service for the collection of house refuse has been fairly satisfactory, and there have been comparatively few complaints of non-removal excepting after holidays, which somewhat dislocate the arrangements. The Vestry have not yet definitely decided on the erection of a "Dust Destructor," but a Committee has been appointed to visit Destructors in work at various places, and advise the Vestry as to the most suitable. Factories and Workshops. A considerable amount of work has been done in connection with the above during the year, and most of the factories and laundries—and of the latter there are large numbers in the parish—have been inspected, and great improvements effected in their sanitary condition. Unsound Food. Six seizures were made of unsound food, in all of which proceedings were taken by the Vestry and penalties to the amount of inflicted. The necessity for more supervision being exercised over the food supply of the parish is a matter that I have on several occasions brought under the notice of the Vestry, and I am strongly of opinion that there should be a special Inspector appointed, at any rate during the summer months, whose duties should be to undertake a strict supervision of the food supply, and the frequent inspection of bakehouses and other places where food is prepared or stored. Sanitary Staff. I am pleased to have to record that the Vestry appointed an additional Sanitary Inspector in July last, so that there are now five Inspectors, there being to each Inspector 3,200 houses and 23,600 inhabitants, as compared with 2,500 houses and 18,750 inhabitants to each Inspector in the whole of London, and 2,900 houses and 15,000 inhabitants to each Inspector in 15 of the large provincial towns. Supervision of Drainage Reconstruction. The duty of supervising the reconstruction of house drainage was formerly in the hands of the Surveyor, but at the commencement of the year was transferred by the Vestry to the Medical Officer of Health, and one of the Drainage Inspectors was transferred from the Works to the Sanitary Department so as to supervise and be responsible under the Medical Officer of Health for the proper carrying out of the house drainage works ordered by the Sanitary Officers of the Vestry. General Sanitary Work. The subjoined Table gives, a record of the work done by your Sanitary Officers:— Complaints received and attended to 1066 Dwelling houses inspected and reported on 2350 Miscellaneous Inspections 1640 Notices requiring sanitary improvements served— Intimations 2189 Statutory Notices 766 It is unnecessary to notice in detail the various improvements effected, but every effort has been made to secure a high standard of sanitation. House to house inspection was made of the following streets, viz.: — Alderville Road, Ashington Road, Bettridge Road, Breer Street, Broomhouse Road, Channing Terrace, Cortayne Road, Coomer Road, Carlton Mews, Coniger Road, Dieppe Street, Dolby Road, Dymock Street, Eli Street, Ewald Road, Estcourt Road, Foskett Road, Francis Street, Grimston Road, Hurlingham Road, Hugon Road, Inverness Terrace, John Street, Mund Street, Lanfrey Place, Peterborough Road, Stephendale Road, Suffolk Street, Townmead Road; but a great amount of work remains to be done in this respect. Drainage Work. A very large amount of work has again been done in connection with defective drainage, and the drains of 715 houses have been entirely reconstructed in accordance with the regulations of the Vestry, and in addition to these the several large factories and laundries, the North End Road Board School, as well as the Earls Court Exhibition —where about a mile and a half of drainage was relaid—have been drained under the supervision of your Sanitary Department. I have given a brief resume of the work done by your Sanitary Department during the year, and from it I think it is clear that steady progress is being made, and looking back through the five years that have elapsed since the Public Health (London) Act was passed, the sanitary authority may fairly claim that they have succeeded in effecting material improvements in the condition of the district, but they must remember that, as I showed in the report for 1893, a considerable proportion of the population of Fulham— at that time probably some 25 per cent. —are living in chronic poverty, and therefore must, under existing social conditions, suffer from a want of proper house accommodation, equally with that of the other commodities of life. As Sir J. Simon has remarked, " Be done what may under the sanitary Acts to banish from the dwellings of the poor all worst degrees of uncleanlines and overcrowding, the condition remains that scanty earnings can buy but scantily of the necessaries and comforts of life, and that where the strictest frugality has to be exercised with regard to necessary food and clothing, where, indeed, but too often, severe privation in these respects has to be endured, only very humble purchase of dwelling space, and still humbler means of comfort and cleanliness within the space, can be afforded." The factor which, after all, underlies many of the conditions which tend to shorten life is poverty, and the consequent problem, which is beyond the power of the sanitary authority to deal with, is "how to make the poor less poor." A matter well worthy of the future consideration of the Vestry, in view of the large working class population resident in Fulham, and the excessive proportion of their wages they have to pay in rent, is the provision by the local authority of house accommodation for the working classes. The question is a large one and not to be decided hastily one way or the other, but, with the low rate at which money can now be borrowed, it is probable that houses could be erected which would afford superior accommodation at lower rents than they now usually obtain, and yet recoup the Vestry for the outlay. In conclusion, I have again to record my opinion that all the members of the sanitary staff have endeavoured zealously and faithfully to discharge their respective duties.
