ANNUAL REPORT OP THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1953. public Health Department 2, Shalston Villas, Surbiton. June 1954. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am presenting my thirty-second Annual Report dealing with health matters of Surbiton. As on previous occasions it follows on lines laid down by the Ministry of Health and the vital statistics are based on figures given by the Registrar General. It should be recorded that these figures have come to hand much earlier than on former occasions; that means that my Annual Report will be to hand sooner than in previous years. The population of Surbiton on which the vital statistics are based is now 62,230, an increase on last year's figure of 640. In order to arrive at a correct birth and death rate a comparability figure is given (1.00 for the former and 1.01 for the latter). This will enable statisticians to compare them and also with those of England and Wales and the Greater Towns. During the year there was an increase in the number of infectious diseases from 856 in 1952 to 1,083 in 1953, mainly due to an increase in measles which can be seen on page 8. The Infantile Mortality rate is 21.02 as compared with 18.42 for 1952, but is very much lower than that for England and Wales and Greater Towns. The rate of providing houses or units of accommodation for 1953 does not seem to be increased upon. For 1952 the total number of units of accommodation was 347 and in 1953, 257. Thirty-seven visits were made regarding overcrowding, or possible overcrowding. Pollution of the Hogsmill Stream still occurs and out of five sam???les and pads three were found to contain paratyphoid B. bacilli. This does give cause for alarm but work has been started on the construction of the Sewage Disposal Works. Suitable ste???s were taken to prevent children paddling or bathing in the stream. 2.

The Housing Act, 1949, introduced a scheme to encourage property owners to modernise existing houses "which though soundly constructed and in good general repair, lack the amenities and conveniences which have come to be regarded as essential to a decent and healthy life", by providing financial assistance for works of improvement. The Council-continued to operate this scheme in cases where new housing accommodation would be provided by the conversion of an existing building, where additional accommodation was to be provided, and where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. Seven-applications for grants were received during the year. Six grants were recommended by the Council and were approved by the Ministry of housing and Local Government. The remaining case did not come within the scope of the Act. The grants were each of £100 and were in respect of works to provide hot water system, bath, internal WC etc. The number of enquiries about this scheme remained small, but increased interest is anticipated when revised conditions of grants introduced in 1954 become more widely known. 21. FOOD HYGIENE. Thirty-nine premises are registered, under section 14 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1938, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale. 1,716 visits were made to these premises and to shops, canteens, restaurants, public-houses, and food handling businesses and vehicles of all descriptions to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food intended for sale. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Council under the Pood & Drugs Act, byelaws and other legislation. Hot water supply provided 13 New washbasins provided 2 Cold stores repaired 1 Pood premises cleansed 51 Internal walls and ceilings repaired 2 Floor covering renewed 3 Drains cleansed, repaired or renewed 8 WCs cleansed or repaired 11 Protection of food from contamination 11 Delivery vans repaired, cleansed, etc 2 Name and address inscribed on vehicles 1 Dustbins supplied 3 Miscellaneous 8 Generally speaking the standard of food hygiene in the Borough has been maintained at the satisfactory level previously reported upon with one exception. This was in connection with the delivery of bread which gave cause for concern because the practice of leaving unwrapped loaves on door steps and window sills suddenly developed alarmingly. The Council had to issue a serious warning to the trade and eventually a conference was agreed upon to go into the question. This conference did not take place till 1954 and will consequently be dealt with in my next annual report. FOOD INSPECTION.

The Analyst's reports end details of action taken on contravening samples were as follows:- 1308 (informal) Sherbet Fountain. The starch content of this article was excessive and the sugar deficient. The chemical constituents causing effervescence were unbalanced giving rise to a slightly alkaline unpleasant taste. The ingredients were not specified in the correct order of the amount in which they were used. See No.1325. 1315 (informal) Sherbet Sucker The composition of this article was Sugar 35% Flour 35% Cornflour 23% Tartaric Acid 3-3% Sodium Bicarbonate 2.7% Flavouring and colouring 1%. The statement of ingredients on the label did not include cornflour, and citric acid was wrongly specified having been replaced by tartaric acid. The total flour and cornflour was excessive and the sugar deficient. The packer was warned and he apologised for the error in printing on the bags and stated that his suppliers had told him the powder was "imported and quite pure". 1325 (informal) Sherbet Powder. This article was of inferior quality due to lack of balance between the ingredients. The proportion of mixed cornflour and potato starch present, namely about 30% was higher than is necessary or desirable and there was a residual alkalinity after effervescing resulting in an unpleasant taste. This powder was submitted by the manufactuerers of No. 1308 as a proposed substitute. They said it was not sold by them as a sherbet but as a Lemon Fizz. The powder was however purchased from them by packers who made it up into sherbet suckers and the like. Correspondence made the objection of the Public Analyst clear to the parties concerned. 1329 (informal) Confectionery Toffee Cigarettes.. This article was one of imitation cigarettes consisting essentially of flour and sugar, the sugar content being not more than 25%. Toffee is made with sugar and fat only and in the opinion of the Public Analyst the description of this article bore no relation to its composition. The manufacturers stated they were 26. 1329 (informal) cont. Confectionery Toffee Cigarettes. producing and marketing under Ministry of Pood licence. The Pood Standards end Labelling Division confirmed this and stated that the firm had asked permission to change the name to "sweet cigarettes". 1333 (informal) Soup, cream of chicken. Contained only 1.5% of fat instead of a minimum of 3½% The manufacturers stated that this can was. from old stock sold to a firm on the strict understanding that it would only be sold to caterers and not to the general public. They promised to pursue the matter and to provide further information. See No. 1354. 1345 (formal) Sausages, pork. Consisted of preserved pork sausages containing 400 p.p.m. of sulphur dioxide. Preservative not disclosed. The matter was taken up with retailer, wholesaler and manufacturer The retailer was positive there was' no preservative label with the sausages, the wholesaler said he passed them on exactly as received, whilst the manufacturers stated "Although most careful investigation has been carried out here we have been unable to account for the fact that this particular parcel was sent out unlabelled". The Council was satisfied that a mistake had occurred and therefore issued a warning letter to the parties concerned. 1347 (informal) Sherbet (Giant Sherbet Fountain). Consisted of sherbet of inferior quality in which there was an excess of cornflour and a deficiency of sugar. The packers stated the article was not their current production and they were unable to account for the inferior quality of the sherbet. They submitted for analysis a sample of their current sherbet (No. 1355) which was favourably reported on by the Public Analyst. 1353 (informal) 'Lucky Di' Junior Kiddies Fountain. Inferior quality. Excess of starch. It was ascertained that another Council had expressed themselves as satisfied with this powder provided it was not described as "sherbet". In the circumstances the matter was not pursued. 27. 1354 (formal) Sous, cream of chicken. Contained only l.4% by weight of fat, instead of a minimum of 3½% Proceedings instituted against retailer for selling to the prejudice of the purchaser Cream of Chicken Soup which was not of the quality demanded. A fine of £10 was imposed and the Council awarded 5 guineas costs. 1367 (informal) Jumbo Sucker. Inferior quality. An excess of starch and a deficiency of sugar. This was another article packed by the same firm as No. 1347 but also an obsolete production. The firm gave an assurance that since 1st April, 1953, they had only used powder similar to sample No. 1355 which they would continue to use. 1374 (informal) Soup, Cream of tomato. Contained only 2.7% by weight of fat, instead of a minimum of This was taken with with the packers who admitted an error as their stores had taken the margarine used to be 100% fat content instead of 85% which was actually the cose. Matter dealt with by way of warning. 1400 (formal) Sausages, pork. Contained 270 p.p.m. by weight of Sulphur dioxide. Preservative not disclosed. Warning given to company concerned. They undertook in future to display a preservative notice in the shop. 1402 (formal) Vinegar, malt. Contained 0.9% of salt. The retailer and not the manufacturer was at fault. He was cautioned and advised as to future sales. 1410 (informal) Peel, candied, Lemon. It was a sample of candied orange peel. Attention of retailer drawn to mistake. 23. ICE CREAM. Premises have been registered by the Corporation under Section 14, Food & Drugs Act, 1938, as under For manufacture, storage and sale 8 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to be limited to ice-lollies 16 For storage and sale, but not manufacture 105 During the year 278 visits were made to premises and vehicles and 162 samples of ice-cream were taken for laboratory examination for bacterial cleanliness, details being as follows :- Ice Cream. Grade I Coliforms absent 113 92.5% 95.9% " " present 24 " II " absent 3 " " present 2 " III " absent 3 2.7% " " present 1 " IV " present 2 1.3% 148 Iced Lollies. Grade I " absent 13 present 1 Total:- 162 In no case was Faecal Coli found. The Public Health Laboratory Service advises that it is unwise to pay too much attention to the result of any one sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that it would be reasonable to expect about 50 per cent Of samples throughout the year to fall into Grade I, 80 per cent into Grades 1 or 2, not more than 20 per cent into Grade 3, and none into Grade 4. The results shewn above are the best we have ever had and seem to oe very satisfactory. The two grade IV and one of the Grade III results were from the same source of supply which was eventually cleared up. Very little ice cream is now made in this district and of the 162 samples only three (iced lollies) were of local manufacture. Bach retailer from whom a sample was taken was suppliedwith a copy of the laboratory report, and a Sanitary Inspector visited the premises and gave advice where reports were not up to the standard expected. Where manufacture took place outside the Borough copies 29. ICE CREAM (Contd). of reports whether good or otherwise were also sent to the Sanitary Inspector for the District concerned for his information. The Minister of Pood made an Order which became operative on 1st June 1953, amending the standard for ice-cream. The principal modifications are shown below Original Standard As amended 7th July 1952. As amended 1st June 1953. Pat - not less than 5% 4% 5% Sugar - not less than 10% 10% 10% Milk solids other than fat - not less than 7½% 5% 7½% There are special standards for ice-cream containing fruit or fruit pulp and for Kosher ice. Five samples of ice-cream and five iced lollies were taken to see that the proper standard was reached and that there were no harmful contents. **11 were found to be in oraer. MILK SUPPLY. (i) At the end of the year there were thirty-three entries on the register as follows :~ Distributors of milk residing in the Borough 15 Distributors of milk residing outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 9 (ii) Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949. Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949. Dealers' licences to sell designated milk were granted as follows :- > Pasteurised milk 12 Pasteurised milk (supplementary) 10 Tuberculin tested milk 10 Tuberculin tested milk (supplementary) 9 Sterilised milk 11 Sterilised milk (supplementary) 7 (iii) One hundred and eighty-nine samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests :- 30.

The only samples which failed to conform to the required standard were as follows (a) Accredited. Of ten biological samples taken at one farm four failed the TB Biological test. It is probable that one tubercular cow was responsible for the presence of TB bacilli in all four samples. The herd was dealt with by Veterinary Officers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to eliminate any infected animals and it was later reported that an infected cow was found and destroyed. (b) Tuberculin Tested. Two samples failed the methylene blue test. In one case the farmer concerned suggested that a sudden spell of hot Weather might have been a contributing factor subsequent samples proved satisfactory. In the second case the retailer immediately terminated his contract and discontinued the supply. (c) Pasteurised. Two samples taken from separate churns at the same premises failed the methylene blue test. The matter was taken up with the producer and subsequent samples were satisfactory. 31. DYSENTERY AND FOOD POISONING. The number of specimens collected and taken to the Laboratory for bacteriological examination in the course of investigating these illnesses was as follows Faeces. Suspected food. 1950 1202 13 1951 694 2 1952 183 15 1953 129 12 DUSTBINS. Thirty-nine dustbins were provided as a result of notices served, two such notices being statutory and the remainder informal. une owner appealed to the Magistrates against the notice served on him by the Council requiring him to provide a dustbin at a dwelling-house. The appeal was dismissed. The Council's scheme for the sale of new dustbins was continued, one hundred and six bins being sold during the year. factories AND bakEHOuseS. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 270 (227 mechanical, 33 non-mechanical and 10 works of building construction). Five hundred and forty visits were made to these premises, and work was carried out to remedy contraventions found as under Want of cleanliness 12 factories. Insufficient sanitary conveniences 3 " Defective, dirty or inadequately lighted sanitary conveniences 15 " Means of escape in case of fire not in order 9 " Three certificates were issued under section 34 of the Factories Act, 1937, that the factories to which they related were provided with such means of escape in case of fire for the persons employed therein as may be reasonably required in the circumstances. There were 88 outworkers on the register at the end of the year. 49 visits were made but no contraventions found. 32. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. Forty-one -licences to station and. use moveable dwellings (caravans) were granted during the year. Twenty-four of the caravans are standing on the Riverhill Estate which has been leased to a local Sports Club. The remainder are stationed on odd sites throughout the Borough. There is one site on which some unlicensed caravans are parked which is receiving consideration. The byelaws with respect to tents, vans, sheds and similar structures made in 1935 were repealed as it was felt they no longer served any useful purpose. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals. Licences in respect of three such premises were issued during the year. Fifteen inspections were made and one minor infringement of the conditions imposed was put right. SHOPS ACT, 1950. Three hundred and fifty-one visits were made in the administration of this Act, and thirty-one infringements were corrected. As a result of a petition from local traders an Order was made under section 1 (4) of the Act exempting from the provisions of section 1 shops in which the trade or business of the retail sale of motor vehicles, caravans and accessories therefor is carried on. Such shops need no longer close for the serving of customers at 1 o'clock on one week-day in every week. DISINFECTION. (a) During the year disinfection was carried out at fifty-one premises in which the following diseases occurred :- Anterior Poliomyelitis (or suspected) 8 Suspected Diphtheria 1 Meningo-coccal infection 1 Scarlet Fever 15 Tuberculosis 11 Miscellaneous 15 Disinfection was also carried out at forty-nine other 33.

At the request of the County Council eight school canteens were sprayed with insecticide to prevent flies and other insect pests, the County Council paying the , cost of the work. 34. DISINFESTATION (Contd). (c) General. Advice is frequently sought from the Department in the identification and measures for eradication of insect pests of various kinds. For the convenience of the public a stock of insecticides and sprayers is held in the Department, and these articles are sold at cost price when required. This service seems to be much appreciated. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. One burial was effected in accordance with Section 50 of the Act where it appeared that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body were being made otherwise than by the Council. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year seventy-two bodies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The ministry of agriculture and Fisheries continued its grant-aid of 50 per cent of the irrecoverable expenditure incurred by the Council in carrying out its functions under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. Grant-aid is not available in respect of expenditure incurred on treatment at commercial and industrial premises, and the full cost of the work has therefore to be recovered from the occupiers or, in certain circumstances, the owners. 48 business or industrial premises, schools, etc. were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. Whilst it is the duty of occupiers of houses to keep their premises free from rats and mice, the Council continued to carry out treatment of infestations at private dwellings without charge provided the occupiers took such steps as might from time to time be necessary and reasonably practicable for preventing their premises from becoming infested. This decision has considerably facilitated the work at private nouses as treatment is table to proceed almost immediately an infestation is found. The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year, and suggest that we are keeping the rodent population to a satisfactorily low level. 35- 1. VISITS.

There were no outstanding events during the year calling for special comment. The many duties which fall to our lot were, I think, well covered. The prospect of new legislation at an early date in connection with housing and food and drugs is stimulating, and we await with considerable interest the efforts of our legislators. I should like to mention the problem of old people which frequently gives us cause for concern. From time "to time we find aged people at the stage where they are unable to manage properly for themselves, and not being looked after by others. Too often they eventually get into a state of squalor from which they are quite unable to extricate themselves. The usual methods of the Sanitary Inspector for dealing- with dirty homes cannot for obvious reasons be applied in these cases and we find ourselves going rather beyond the normal scope of our duties in order to help these unfortunates. I have been privleged to serve for several years on the local Old People's Welfare Committee and admire very much the voluntary work carried out by members of that organisation. The important thing is to keep these lonely elderly folk so interested in life that they do not slip into the hermit state, and in this sphere the workers of the Welfare Committee achieve so much. Once that unhappy state has been reached it is difficult to know how to deal with such people. As matters stand at the moment there does not seem to be a simple remedy for this problem. Rather does it behove everyone concerned, be they paid officers or voluntary social workers, to continue to do what they can for such cases as come to their notice, even if the desired results can only be achieved by methods which are not strictly 'official'. Finally, in connection with Civil Defence the Council has seen fit to appoint me as Head of the local Welfare Section, and the organisation and training of that Section is tending to become merged with the routine work of the Department. I am, Mr Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, R. J. ELDRIDQE, Senior Sanitary Inspector. I wish to thank the members of my staff in the Public Health Department for their co-operation, particularly the Senior Sanitary Inspector. 1CVILLE H. LINZBS, Medical Officer of Health. 39.
