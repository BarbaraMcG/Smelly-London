HAM 64 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health OF THE borough of hammersmith For the Year 1917. annual report OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH OF THE BOROUGH OF HAMMERSMITH For the Year 1917. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith. Gentlemen,—In the absence of Dr. Howell, who is serving in the Army, I beg to submit the Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1917, which, in accordance with the suggestion of the Local Government Board, is limited to a record of the most important facts and figures. Population.—The following estimates of population have been adopted by the Registrar General for the calculation of the Death and Birth Rates of the Borough. For the Death Rate (estimated civilian population) 114,952 For the Birth Rate (estimated total population) 128,139 Looking at the crowded state of the borough it is probable that both are under estimated. Marriages.—1,121 marriages were registered during the year against 1,192 in 1916, and the marriage rate, i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 inhabitants, was 17.5. Births.—Including 187 children born of Hammersmith mothers in lying-in institutions situated in other boroughs 2,278 births were registered, representing a birth rate of 177 per 1,000, being the lowest recorded in Hammersmith and 2.6 below that of 1916. Illegitimacy.—The illegitimates numbered 180 or 8 per cent. of the total births, the highest proportion recorded. 2 Deaths.—During 1917, 1,212 deaths of civilians were registered in the borough, but of these 195 were of persons not belonging to the borough, while 618 inhabitants of Hammersmith died outside the borough, chiefly in various public institutions. There were therefore 1,635 deaths of persons having their usual residence in Hammersmith, representing a death rate of 14.3 per 1,000 of the estimated civilian population, which is the same as the average rate of the preceding five years. The death rate of the County of London was 15.7 per 1,000, and in the various Metropolitan boroughs the rates ranged from 11.9 in Lewisham and Woolwich to 22.2 in Shoreditch. Excess of Births Over Deaths.—The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 643, compared with 937, 787, and 937 in the preceding three years. The following table gives the statistics of the borough during 1917 and the five previous years in the form prescribed by the Local Government Board- TABLE I.

Nett Deaths in the Year of: Legitimate Infants, 201 ; Illegitimate Infants, 50. Prevention of Infant Mortality.—Notification of Births.—1,916 notifications of living, and 45 of stillborn children were received under the Notification of Births 5 Act, 86-o per cent, of the births registered being notified. The notifications were received from— Midwives. Doctors. Lying-in Hospitals. Poor-Law Institutions. Parents. 1,144 596 117 6 98 The visitation of infants was to some extent interfered with by the epidemic of Measles, which prevailed throughout the borough during the first six months of the year, but 1,857 first visits, and 7,676 subsequent visits were paid by your three Health Visitors. The feeding of the infants at the time of the first visit was found to be as under :— Breast fed 1,573 Hand and breast fed 147 Hand only 137 The work of your Health Visitors was actively supplemented by the infant welfare work carried on by the Voluntary Associations of the Borough. 675 babies attended the consultations held by the doctors attached to the Hammersmith Welfare Centre and the Women's League of Service Welfare Centre, who made in all 7,076 attendances, and some of these were visited by the nurses attached to the staff of the Centres. Ante-natal clinics are held at Glenthorne Road Centre, and Sulgrave Road Centre, and at the latter a Dental Clinic is held, and dinners are provided at a small cost for nursing and expectant mothers. Arrangements have been made by the Borough Council for the treatment at the School Treatment Centre, Carnforth Lodge, of children under school age suffering from minor ailments, dental defects, and enlarged tonsils and adenoids requiring operation. The question of providing one or more nurseries for the children of women engaged on munitions and other work has been under the consideration of the Council, but no premises suitable for the purpose have as yet been found. Deaths of Illegitimate Infants.—Of the 251 infants who died before attaining the age of one year, 50, or 19 per cent. were illegitimate, the mortality among them being 6 in the proportion of 278 deaths per 1,000 illegitimate births against 96 per 1,000 among children born in wedlock. In the Annual Report for 1916 an error was made with regard to the death-rate for that year of illegitimate infants which was calculated on the number of illegitimate children born in the borough. If the illegitimates born in the lying-in institutions outside the borough in that year are included, the proportion of illegitimate deaths to births will be reduced from 538 to 222 per 1,000. Deaths from Epidemic Diseases.—To the seven principal epidemic diseases 114 deaths were ascribed, giving a death rate of 0.99 per 1,000, against 0.88 per 1,000 in 1916. Sickness from Notifiable Infectious Diseases.—The following table gives the number of cases of infectious diseases notified in the borough, together with the. number removed to hospital :— TABLE IV.
