STPAN 26 Saint Pancras, Middlesex. FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Year 1869. To the Vestrymen of St. Pancras. Gentlemen, In the year 1869, 7601 births were registered in the parish of St. Fancras; or, more correctly, 7580 births during the 52 weeks ending 1st January, 1870. 5043 deaths were registered as having occurred during the year of 365 days. These numbers require corrections to be made for the births and deaths, in the Strand Union Workhouse, of persons not belonging to this parish; when these corrections are made, it is found that the corrected number of births was 7556, and the corrected number of deaths 4962, in the year of 365 days. The natural increase of the population of St. Pancras (the excess of births over deaths) was thus 2594. The births fall short of those in 1868 by 154 ; the deaths exceed those of 1868 by 167; and the natural increase of population was 321 less than in that year. Until the next census shall have been taken in 1871, any estimate of the population of this parish must necessarily be approximate; for there are no sufficient data available for calculating accurately the immigration and emigration affecting the resident population. If the rate of increase of population in this parish between the years 1851 and 1861 had been 2 maintained, there would have been 232,000 persons living in St. Pancras in the middle of 1869. A more accurate method of calculation gives the population as 224,500 at that period; and this number is probably not far from the true number. Taking then the population in round numbers as 224,000, there was in 1869 a birth-rate of 33.73, and an annual rate of mortality of 22.15 per 1000 persons living in 1869. In 1869, the death rate was 22.15 per 1000. „ 1868, „ „ 21.69 „ 1867, „ „ 21.54 „ 1866, „ „ 23.50 „ 1865, „ „ 23.72 „ 1864, „ „ 25.35 „ 1863 „ „ 23.06 „ 1862, „ „ 21.60 The average annual rate of mortality of the 8 years, 1862-9, was 22.83 per 1000. In the Metropolis, as a whole, the annual rate of mortality in 1869 was 24.66 per 1000 ; in the North Districts, of which St. Pancras forms a part, the rate of mortality was 23.71 per 1000. The death rate in St. Pancras was thus not only below that of the metropolis generally, but also below that of its North Districts. In the year before us, the mortality of London was exceptionally high everywhere, except in the West Districts and in South London, where the effects of drainage are manifest. It will be observed that in this parish, the annual rate of mortality was slightly in excess of that of the two preceding years, and a little less than that of the average of the last 8 years. MORTALITY IN THE SEVERAL SUB-DISTRICTS, AND IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. In the year before us, the deaths excluding those that occurred in the Workhouses, exceeded those of the preceding year in the sub-districts of Regent's Park, Kentish Town, Camden Town, and Somers Town, that is, in the localities lying North of Euston Road, whilst in the sub-districts of Tottenham Court, and of Gray's Inn Road, lying South of Euston Road, the deaths were fewer than in 1868. In every one of the Public Institutions situate in the St. Pancras, that is to say, in the Parish Workhouse, in the Strand Union Workhouse, and in Royal Free and University College Hospitals, the deaths were fewer than in 1868. The mortality in the Workhouse Infirmary last year has attracted much attention, and has unhappily given rise to much difference of opinion, not to say strife. So late as the 19th February, 1870, the Registrar 3 General, in commenting upon the mortality in the Public Institutions of the metropolis, says:—" Some explanation is required of the 499 deaths in Marylebone, and of the 502 deaths in Pancras Workhouse." It is somewhat singular that the absolute number of deaths is here alone referred to. On comparing the deaths in our Workhouse for the last 4 years, we find:— In 1869, the deaths were 503. „ 1868, „ „ 518. „ 1867, „ „ 556. „ 1866, „ „ 595. But statements of the number of deaths, without statements of the number of persons, among whom the deaths occurred, are valueless in making comparisons. The average number of Inmates in the Workhouse during the corresponding periods was:— In 1869 17105/9 „ 1868 17937/9 „ 1867 18244/2 „ 1866 18275/9 Thus we find that— In 1869, the deaths were 1 in 3.40. „ 1868 1 „ 8.46. „ 1867, „ „ 1 „ 3.28. „ 1866, „ „ 1 „ 3.07. of the average daily number of Inmates of the Institution; and hence, that although the mortality in 1869 in the Workhouse partook of the slightly increased mortality of the parish generally, when compared with 1868, yet the rate of mortality of the two last years has been considerably below that of 1866 and 1867. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. The mortality of children under five years of age was 2,109, being 30 in excess of the numbers for the preceding year. It is a singular coincidence that the deaths from the contagious diseases of childhood—Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, and Hooping Cough—likewise exceeded, in the aggregate, those of 1868 by 31. The deaths among persons upwards of 60 years of age was 1,059, being 86 more than in the preceding year. 1,874 persons died between the ages of 5 and 60 years : this is 68 more than in the year 1868. 4 MORTALITY FROM DIFFERENT DISEASES. The annual rates of mortality, from the undermentioned diseases, in the year under notice were, in London and in St. Pancras respectively:— London St. Panoras Small Pox (deaths in the Small Pox Hospital included) 0.09 0.01 Diarrhœa and Cholera 1.17 0.98 Typhus and Enteric Fevers (deaths in the London Fever Hospital included) 0.56 0.55 Scarlet Fever 1.83 1.07 Diphtheria 0.11 0.09 Hooping Cough 1.18 0.99 Measles 0.45 0.30 Phthisis 2.77 2.93 Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Asthma 4.10 3.56 The prevalent diseases which caused great mortalities were Hooping Cough and Scarlet Fever. The deaths from Hooping Cough which were 43 in number in the first quarter, rose to 73 in the second quarter, then sank to 65 in the third quarter, and 40 in the fourth quarter: 221 children died from this disease in the course of the year, or 1 in 1,014 of the population; whilst in 1868, the deaths were only 128, or 1 in 1,717 of the population. The deaths from Scarlet Fever sank from 52 in the first quarter to 29 in the second; they then rose to 55 in the third, and 103 in the fourth quarter: 47 children dying from this disease in the month of November alone. A high rate of mortality has been maintained from the malady throughout the winter months. Perhaps St. Pancras has never been visited by a severer epidemic of Scarlet Fever. RELAPSING FEVER. In the autumn of the year under review, much alarm was felt, not only in St. Pancras, but throughout the metropolis, at the re.appearance of Relapsing Fever—a disease which had been lost sight of in this country for several years. This disease seems to have appeared in St. Pancras at the end of May last, but to have remained for some time unrecognized as a specific form of Fever. In October, November, and December, the number and nature of the cases sent to the London Fever Hospital were such as to excite apprehensions that this not highly mortal, but eminently pauperising disease, was about to lay hold on large numbers of the poorer inhabitants. At one time it seemed as if Hospital accommodation was about to fail. Happily at this juncture the South Hampstead Fever Hospital was opened; and though the beds there have been taxed to the utmost, this has not been 5 through, any great influx of paupers from this parish. Active sanitary measures and precautions were taken by the Vestry and its Officers, and the Guardians of the Poor empowered their Officers to grant the best of all preventives of the disease, good nourishment, wherever necessary. As a consequence, since the commencement of the current year very few cases of Relapsing Fever have been met with in St. Pancras. This Fever was entirely confined in this parish to the pauper population of the Southern part of the parish. The existence of 58 cases of the disease was ascertained. REGISTERED COMMON LODGING-HOUSES. The Chief Commissioner of Police has courteously furnished me with a list of the common lodging-houses in this parish. These houses are regulated by special statutes,—"The Common Lodging-houses Act, 1851," and " The Common Lodging-houses Act, 1853," and are placed under the control of the police. Ever since these places were put in their hands, it has been too readily assumed that, as regards sanitary condition, the houses were in such a satisfactory state, that no Fever case ever occurred in them. This supposed exemption of the inmates of common lodginghouses having recently been doubted, and the Medical Officer of the Privy Council having expressed an opinion to a Metropolitan Board, that the Medical Officer of Health is not absolved from his sanitary duties in regard to a house in his district, because it is registered as a common lodging-house, and that he is the most proper person to advise the police, acting as local authority under " The Common Lodging-house Act, 1853," sec. 7, as to the course to be pursued for preventing the spread of disease ; and that the Medical Officer of Health will do well to give every assistance in his power to the Police Inspectors, in regard to common lodging-houses in his district, as well, when asked by them, by advising them on sanitary matters, and giving a certificate of satisfactory disinfection as, without being asked to do so, by calling their attention to any sanitary defects in such houses or their management, I have had all these registered places visited and reported on. There are 24 registered common lodging-houses in St. Pancras, and most of these are situated near Fitzroy Place and Fitzroy Square : 23 of these places are in use, and are licensed for 335 beds. The houses are, as a rule, in good sanitary condition; and they have, in the aggregate, contributed, as far as I can ascertain, only one case of Fever (a case of Scarlet Fever) to the Fever Hospitals in 1869. No case of Relapsing Fever, or of any form of continued Fever, occurred in them during the past year. SMALL POX AND VACCINATION. The year 1869 was one of nearly entire immunity from Small Pox until the month of December. Only one death occurred from this disease. The closing month of the year was marked, however, by an apparently sudden extension of the disorder into all the wards of the parish, except 6 No. 4. How far the disease may spread is at present uncertain. I append the usual return (kindly furnished by the Clerk to the Guardians of the Poor) for the year ending Michaelmas, 1869. The number of children, under 1 year of age, successfully vaccinated by the Public Vaccinators, was reduced from 287i in 1868, to 2497 in 1869; and I believe, that had the return been made out to the close of the year in December, a still further diminution in the numbers would have been observed. The number of persons above 1 year of age successfully vaccinated was 364 only, as compared with 757 in the year 1868. The number of births registered in the parish during the period included in this return was 7741. I learn from various medical practitioners, that private vaccination has been likewise much decreased during the past year. Considering the wide diffusion of Small Pox in St. Pancras, among both rich and poor, this diminution in the amount of vaccination done is much to be deplored. The need of a disinfecting chamber, such as is contemplated in the Sanitary Act, 1866, is much felt in dealing with Small Pox. SANITARY WORKS. In an Appendix a Table is given, kindly furnished by Mr. Worrell, Chief Clerk in the Works Department, of the principal works of sewerage done in the parish during the year 1869. From this it appears that 1630 feet of large brick sewers, 2626 feet of pipe drainage have been laid. Many sewers were repaired during the course of the year. The sewers were deodorized in summer with carbolic acid. Annexed is a Table of the chief Sanitary improvements carried out, under the inspection of the Sanitary Officers. I am indebted to Mr. John Leach, and to the Sanitary Inspectors, Messrs. Hartley and Rouch, for its compilation:— 7 RETURN, shewing the Works executed and Improvements effected in the Parish of Saint Pancras, under the supervision of the Sanitary Officers, during the year ending December 31st, 1869.

The highly offensive trade of gut cleaning has been abolished in Brook's Gardens, an old standing source of annoyance and danger to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. In 4 cases, smoke nuisances have been effectually dealt with. In six instances, horses and other animals in improper places, or so kept as to be a nuisance and injurious to health, have been removed. In several cases, occupiers of densely crowded houses and apartments have been made to lessen the number of their lodgers, and to prevent the indecent and dangerous practice of herding together, which is, unfortunately, only too common among the dirty and poorest classes. Empowered by the " Workshop Regulation Act," this department has, in some cases, put a stop to the practice of working after hours, thus conferring a great boon upon workwomen and children who, in many cases, are compelled to stay long after their time without equivalent pay, and at the caprice of employers to offend whom, would simply result in dismissal. The inspection and disinfection of houses, after Fever or other infectious disease, has been much extended, and has occupied a large portion of the time of the Sanitary Inspectors. 985 notices to abate nuisances were served by the Inspectors during the year: 784 of which were primary, and 201 final. It has been necessary in 91 cases to enforce these notices by Police Court proceedings. 8 In the construction and repair of drains, 2182 feet of piping has been used : 1734 feet of which were laid under the supervision of Mr. Rouch, and 448 feet under that of Mr. Hartley. The market places are frequently visited, and 128 seizures were made of stale and unsound fish, fruit, vegetables, and other articles of food exposed for sale, amongst which may be enumerated:—30 pads, 7½ barrels, 6 kits, 3¼rounds, 1 flat, 1 turn, and 1 box, of plaice; 25 boxes, 5 barrels, 13 pads, 1 parcel, and kit, of dried herrings; 3 boxes of mixed fish, 2 pads, and 1 barrel of haddocks; 27 pads, 1 barrel, 2 molloys, 4 boxes, and 1 trunk of mackerel; 24 trunks, and 2 pairs of soles; 1 bag of mussels; 1 basket of lobsters; 2 barrels, 1 hamper, and 1 basket of crabs; 2 crates, and 10 dozen of cauliflowers; 1½ sieve of mushrooms; 11 boxes of oranges; 28 baskets of cherries; 1 sieve of strawberries; 7 sieves of currants; 1 sieve of plums; 4 baskets of grapes; 1½ bushel of pears; and half a bushel of walnuts. Independently of market visitations, the Inspectors, it is estimated, make 8000 visits annually to bake-houses, cow-houses, slaughter-houses, mews, yards, courts, &c., and this estimate does not include numerous visits to premises against which complaints are lodged at the office, and of these complaints made by the public, there were 890 during the year. REPORT ON THE SUPPLY OF GAS. The average illuminating power of the gas supplied by the Imperial Gas Light and Coke Company, was 14.3 standard sperm candles. The mean of the monthly maximum results was 15.5, and the mean of the monthly minimum results 13.3 candles. The highest illuminating power observed was 16.8, and the lowest 11.7 candles. An illuminating power of 12 standard sperm candles was prescribed by the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860; and on only one occasion did the illuminating power fall below the statutory limitation. Of impurities, ammonia was nearly always present, whilst sulphuretted hydrogen was invariably absent; whilst the sulphur present in all forms varied from 8.17 to 24.5 grains per 100 cubic feet; 20 grains per 100 cubic feet being the legal maximum permitted.
