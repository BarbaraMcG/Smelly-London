THE Twenty first Annual Report OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE VESTRY of the parish OF ST. MARTIN-IN-THE-FIELDS, FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1877. In conformity with the 198th Section of "The Metropolis Local Management Act," the following Report of the affairs and business of the Vestry during the past year, accompanied by an Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure, duly audited as required by the Act, is made. Vestey Meetings and Committees. The Return attached to this Report will show that the Vestry has held 24 meetings, and the Committees 6 appointed by the Vestry have held 32 meetings during the year. Parliamentary Measures. METROPOLITAN STREET IMPROVEMENTS. A Bill for enabling the Metropolitan Board of Works to make certain New Streets and Street Improvements within the Metropolis was introduced into the House of Commons during the present Session. Inasmuch as the Bill proposed to remove or interfere with the steps and portico of St. Martin's Church, it was determined that, on the part of the parishioners, every means should be used to oppose that portion of the Bill. The Metropolitan Board of Works having been in vain appealed to to relinquish the Clause in question, the House of Commons was moved by Sir Charles Russell, Bart., M.P. for Westminster, to reject the Bill on its second reading, the result of which was an undertaking by the Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works that the Bill should omit the objectionable Clause, and the Bill was amended accordingly. Sanitary Measures. The Medical Officer's Report is attached, showing the sanitary state of the parish, and the steps taken to improve it during the past year. In connection therewith the Vestry have caused 7 64 notices for abatement of nuisances to be served during the past year, and 3 summonses have been issued to compel the inhabitants to abate the nuisances complained of. In all other cases the notices have been complied with. Surveyor's Report. Under this head, all the works done under the direction of the Vestry will appear. Conclusion, Bound up with the Annual Report will be found a detailed account of the Receipts and Expenditure of the rents and dividends belonging to the Alms Fund in. the parish devoted to charitable purposes, and distributed by the Churchwardens in the support of Alms Women and Out-Pensioners elected by the Yestry. An Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure on account of the Poor Rates for the half-years ending respectively, the 29th September, 1876, and 25th March, 1877, has also been added. J.

Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields, for the Tear 187(3. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Seventh Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. In the latter part of this year an epidemic of Smallpox again visited us. The last appearance of this disease as an epidemic in the Metropolis was in the years 1870 and 1871. This complaint appears regularly amongst us after an interval of a few years, and is due, no doubt, to the neglect of vaccination and re-vaccination. In the absence of the prevalence of Smallpox the public neglect to guard themselves by the prophylactic properties of vaccination against the terrible scourge of Smallpox. In all cases of this disease coming under my notice b 18 I have seen that the room wherein the patient was during the illness was thoroughly and efficiently disinfected, together with the clothing and all dirty linen. All pauper cases of this disease should undoubtedly be at once removed to the public Smallpox Hospital; the houses of the poor are so miserable and in most cases so many living in one room, that allowing a case to remain is sure to spread the disease through the whole family, the other inmates of the house, and the surrounding neighbourhood. Isolation is the only sure method of stamping out the disease. The question has been mooted lately as to the advisability of providing hospital accommodation for the treatment of epidemic infectious disease for the non-pauper class. The question then arises as to the constitution, the authority, and the administration of these hospitals. The Society of Medical Officers of Health passed the following resolution at one of their meetings. "That adequate provision for the isolation and treatment of epidemic infectious disease in the Metropolis does not exist; that such provision could be best made in a comprehensive and systematic manner by one central authority acting for the whole Metropolis" To this suggestion I entirely agree, it would be a far better method than each parish of the Metropolis providing a hospital of its own; it would be more economical, and would, I am sure, work well. 19 Births. The Births registered in the year 1876 were 494, that is 18 more than in the previous year. Births, 1876. Males 264 7 494 Females 230 Births, 1875. Males 246 476 Females 230 Deaths. The Deaths registered in the year amounted to 418, that is 85 less than in the previous year. This decrease is due to the closure of the Charing Cross Hospital for six weeks whilst undergoing enlargement, and when this establishment was re-opened for some 1 time afterwards the Governors had only accommodation for a limited number of beds. Of the above 418 deaths, 78 occurred in the Charing Cress Hospital; of this latter number, 54 were nonresidents in St. Martin-in-the-Fields. This circumstance will therefore give the true death-rate of the Parish. The following tables will show the number of deaths occurring in the Parish for the years 1876 and 1875, B 2 20 with the annual death-rate per 1,000 of the estimated population:— Deaths, 1870 418 Deduct non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 54 364 Death-rate per 1,000, 17.2 Ratio of Deaths to population 1 in 58'1 Deaths, 1875 .. 503 Deduct non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 115 388 Death-rate per 1,000, 18 3 Ratio of Deaths to population 1 in 54.5 By the above figures the death-rate per 1,000 for the year 1876 was 17.2. This is a very low death-rate, thus showing the healthy condition of our Parish. The annual death-rate per 1,000 for the whole of London in the year 1876 was 223. Appended is the annual death-rate per 1,000 in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the last six years:— 1871. 1872. 1873. 1874. 1875. 1876. 19.4. 18.7. 20.2. 18.6. 18.3. 17.2. Ages at Death. Of the 418 deaths, 152 occurred in children under five years of age, 24 between the ages of 5 and 20 years, 88 between 20 and 40 years, 79 between 40 and 60 years, 63 between 60 and 80 years, and 12 above 80 years. 21 Causes of Death. Zymottc Diseases.—This class of complaints includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Croup, Whooping Cough, Typhus Fever, Typhoid Fever, Simple Continued Fever, Remittent Fever, Diarrhoea, and Cholera. The mortality from these diseases is 43, that is 15 less than in the previous year. Smallpox.—One death was due to this disease. Measles.—There were 5 deaths from this disease. This number is 3 more than in the previous year. Scarlet Fever.—Only 4 deaths were due to this malady. Whooping Cough was fatal to 11. This is 2 less than in the preceding year. Fever. — This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever, and Remittent Fever. Only 4 deaths were registered from this class of disease. Three were due to Typhoid Fever, and 1 to Remittent Fever. Diarrhcea.—Eighteen deaths occurred from this malady, all in children under 5 years of age. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs.—Diseases . of the Respiratory Organs, including Consumption, destroyed 135. This is 48 less than in the previous year. Disease of Heart.—Nineteen deaths were registered from this complaint, against 41 in the previous year. Cancer proved fatal to 11 persons. The deaths from all other causes, with the ages atdeath, will be found fully detailed at the end of my Report. Inquests. In the year 1876, there were held 54 inquests- Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— Natural causes ,, 23 Drowning (No evidence to show how deceased came into the water 4 6 Drowning (Suicide) 2 Suffocation (Infants whilst sleeping with Parents) 2 Run over or knocked down in the street 3 Burns and Scalds 3 Injuries received from falling down stairs 3 Pistol shot wound 1 Injuries received at the Charing Cross Railway Station 1 Injuries received from the falling of a wall 1 Cause not specified 2 Poison (Laudanum taken by a man when insane) 1 Poison, Alcoholic (inadvertently administered to an infant) 1 Abscess of Brain (accidental blow on head) 1 Fractured Skull (caused by the machinery at the Queers Theatre) 1 Injuries to Head (caused by the floor of a room giving way) 1 Cut Throat (Suicide) 1 Injuries received from fall from ladder 1 23 Injuries received from being thrown from a cart 1 Chloroform (when about to undergo an operation) 1 54 Bakehouses. The several Bakehouses situated in the Parish have been duly inspected. Some few I have caused notices to be served upon the owners for the purpose of limewhiting, etc. Sanitary Work. In the year 1876, 60 notices were served upon owners or occupiers of property to remedy sanitary defects. Legal proceedings in three cases were resorted to, the owners or occupiers failing to act upon the notices served. The several courts and passages in the Parish have been lime-whited from time to time. The pipe sewers have been regularly flushed; also those gullies in the streets which at times emit offensive effluvia, also flushed with carbolic acid and water. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 24 Summary of Sanitary Work performed during the Year 1876.
