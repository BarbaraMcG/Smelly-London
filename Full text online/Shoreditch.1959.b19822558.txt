AC. 4363 SHOR 64 REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF SHOREDITCH IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON FOR THE YEAR 1959 BY B. BROADBENT, M. A. ,M. B. ,M. R. C. S. ,D. P. H. , Medical Officer of Health. REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF SHOREDITCH IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON FOR THE YEAR 1959 BY B. BROADBENT, M. A., M. B., M.R. C. S., D. P. H., Medical Officer of Health. Printed by WATERLOW & SONS LIMITED. S.S.6220 2. To the MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OP SHOREDITCH. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, In introducing the Annual Report on the state of the public health in Shoreditch for 1959, I should state that the Minister of Health has again requested that, apart from a few minor additions, the report should follow the same lines as laid down for several years past. One of these additions, however, - the perinatal mortality - which shows the combined stillbirths and deaths under 1 week per 1000 total live - and still-births, indicates that Shoreditch is not so good as it might be, and is probably linked with the fact that a very high percentage of young mothers in this Borough are doing full-time work apart from their household duties. In fact, this is so universally the case, that it is generally impossible for the public health inspectors to gain access to premises unless there is either a case of acute infectious disease in the house or an appointment has previously been made! Also possibly linked with this same point is the fact that the total number of live births has fallen below 600 (the lowest ever known in Shoreditch) as against figures over 1000 at the time I first took this post in 1947 (population only 1,000 more then) - and this despite the possible lure of children's allowances! The number of infantile deaths was greater than in any year since 1952, half of them being before the child was one day old. Also, because the number of births was smaller, the stillbirth rate was the highest it has been since 1947. However, despite these setbacks, we have resumed our recent trend of having no maternal deaths. With regard to deaths in the general population, apart from cancer of the lung which was fractionally the largest ever, there was no noticeable variation from the average of recent years, although the reduced birth rate now brings the number dying, perilously near to the number being born, the balance being now only 0.7 per 1000. Except during the early years of the last war the figures have never been so unfavourable to the continuance of the human race! (Even the illegitimate births have only once been smallerl) The notifications of infectious diseases were rather higher, but this was due almost entirely to measles, the bugbear of dysentery having dropped to half, and others being of minimal extent, with no cases of diphtheria, only 3 polios and 39 T.B's (with a continuation of last year's record low of 4 deaths only). The Council's Social Welfare Services (see p. 19 ) have gone further ahead, with a record number of 954 visitors spending at least 2 weeks each at the Shoreditch Holiday & Rest Home. The numbers attending the 3 full-time and 4 part-time Old People's Clubs (run by this department) have been maintained, with Meals on Wheels to Clubs, and (per W.V.S. and Salvation Army) to homebound. Our 3 lady visitors (one full-time whose salary is partly paid by the City of London & East London Dispensary Trustees) have again paid more than 4,000 visits to pensioners, doing most noble work in the process. Our free secondhand furniture has again had a good turnover, the S.O.S. cards have continued to be handed out to the lonely, the free shoe repairs by the Lion Boys' Club are still popular, the loan of library books to the homebound and the gift of novels to the slow readers (and magnifying glasses where needed) has continued, 3. gifts of pots of growing mint and. so on all make for a fuller life for the Borough's Old Folk. The situation with regard to Public Health Inspectors is not so good as had been hoped when last year's report was written, because it is becoming even more obvious that the attraction of less urbanised areas than Shoreditch is too great. So much is this the case, that inspectors trained in this department are willing to sacrifice their financial help rather than to remain for the minimum period of two years asked by the Council! This state of affairs is very discouraging to the inspectors who spend their prccious time training these students. Many people (including even some members of the Council) assume that there is little work for public health inspectors, now that the major part of the Borough has been rebuilt since the War, but a glimpse at the new 1959 legislation listed at the end of this report (p. 48) should convince the doubters that there are still plenty of facets available, apart from the legislation in existence prior to 19591 (as covered by Part VI of this report - p. 22 at seq.) The Rent Act work, involving certificates of disrepair and revocation certificates has again gone smoothly, without appeals against the Council's decisions, by either landlords or tenants - but would have been more effective if the certificates of disrepair had been compiled by trained workers instead of by tenants. The first smoke control order took effect on the 1st September, 1959, and has worked very smoothly, a second one has been approved in principle, and it is hoped to cover the whole borough in 7 stages by 1966. (See map, p.33) The total number of factories at the end of the year was 1,174 (a slight increase), and outworkers totalled 1,203. Rodent servicing contracts brought in £1475.17.0. 27 block control schemes were carried out, 65 premises were satisfactorily treated for rat infestation, and 111 for mice (all of minor character, 418 sewer manholes were baited twice during the year, and indicated a reduction in rat population (these figures are for only 9 months, so that future figures may show the calendar year's results instead of the financial year's as previously. Our Food Inspector paid 3,538 visits, and we were able during the year to close the last of the Borough's underground bakehouses. School canteens and the 81 factory canteens were found to be well maintained, and much propaganda was used, both verbal and written. Street traders cooperated well, and the 121 Public Houses cane up to a good standard, as also did the ice cream sampled. Our Public Analyst examined 229 samples, the main sophistication being found in ground nutmeg, which was impossible to pinpoint. No food had to be seized as unfit, but 428 certificates were issued for unsound food voluntarily surrendered. 4. The fly situation remains satisfactory, largely owing to the use of gammexane in all dustbins, and the free washing facilities in all public conveniences are widely used. The distribution of propaganda has been widespread, through notice boards, at homes where infectious disease was found, and through the Libraries - apart from the even more valuable word-of-mouth method. A total of 4 trainees and 8 student Public Health Inspectors have now qualified as a result of training given in the department. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the loyal support and energy of the whole staff in the department, and I wish to thank the Chairmen and Members of the Council for their cooperation, as well as thanking the various persons and bodies associated with the work, including King Edward's Hospital Fund, the trustees of the City of London and East London Dispensary Fund, many Local Health Authorities and our local Hospitals and Associations. Yours faithfully, B. BROADBENT Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Old Street, E.C.I. SHOreditch 76OO. P.S. As space is available on this page, perhaps it may not be out of place to summarise my findings as a result of contacting relatives of persons certified by the Coroner as having died from coronary heart disease. The condition was largely in men between 45 and 65, and seems to fall into three types (a) Those who inherit the tendency (b) Those who eat an excess of animal fat and put on weight (instead of eating some fat from fish and certain vegetable oils). (c) Those who worry themselves to death and do not sleep in consequence. The first group can only approach life philosophically (and try 3 - below). The second have the remedy in their own hands, and The third group should see their doctors, and also realise that nothing is gained, but much lost, by letting life "get them down". B. B. 5.

The Registrar-General's estimate for the mid-year 1959 population was the same as that for the previous year - 43,330. This figure is used for statistical purposes throughout this report. The density of the population is 65 persons per acre. The Area Comparability Factors for the Borough are Births 0.91 and Deaths 0.93, and the rates shown in this report have been adjusted accordingly, BIRTHS. The numbers of registered live births allocated to the Borough during the calendar year 1959 were as follows :- Total live births - (Legitimate and illegitimate) Males 313 Females 283 Total 596 Illegitimate live births - Males 26 Females 19 Total 45 The birth rate for the borough was 12.51. For England and Wales the rate was 16.5 and for London 17.3. The illegitimate births represented 7.55 per cent of all births in the borough. STILLBIRTHS. The number of registered stillbirths allocated to the borough was 17, or 2.77 per cent of all births. MARRIAGES. The number of marriages during the year was 430 and the marriage rate was 19.8 per 1,000 population. The marriage rate for the Metropolis was 20.2 and that for England and Wales 15.0 DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in the borough in 1959 was - 574 Transferable deaths - Non-residents registered in Shoreditch - 207 Shoreditch residents registered elsewhere - 185 The number of deaths allocated to the borough is therefore - 552 This gives a death rate for the borough of 11.05 compared with 11.6 for England and Wales, and 11.9 for London. In connection with these deaths 24 inquests were held. 418 or 76 per cent of the people belonging to Shoreditch who died during the year, died in hospital. 11. The Table on page 9 showing causes of death at all ages has been supplied by the Registrar-General. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The deaths of infants under one year numbered 16 of which 12 were males. These deaths amounted to 2.89 per cent of the total net Shoreditch deaths from all causes, as compared with 3.17 per cent in 1958. The infantile mortality rate (death rate of infants under one year per 1,000 live births) for Shoreditch was 26.84, the rate for England and Wales being 22.2 and that for London 22.3 One illegitimate infant died. The number of deaths of infants under 4 weeks of age was 10, which gives a neo-natal rate of 16.77. INFANTILE MORTALITY IN THE BOROUGH DURING 1959.

CANCER. The deaths from cancer in the Borough during the year numbered 105 as compared with 108 in 1958. BURIAL OF THE DEAD. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Borough Council is responsible for arranging for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in their area, and where no other suitable arrangements for burial have been made or are being made. During the year 5 burials were carried out. The Council have not yet carried out any cremations, as although it may appear at the time of death that there are no surviving relatives, there is always the remote possibility that at some future date, one may come forward and start enquiries which might result in the Council's action being disputed. III. - INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. During the year 627 notifications of infectious disease were received, but in six cases diagnosis was revised after examination of the patients in hospital. SMALLPOX AND VACCINATION. No case of smallpox occurred in the Borough during the year and no vaccinations were performed by the Medical Officer of Health under the Public Health (Smallpox Prevention) Regulations, 1917. 13.

PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS 1925. These regulations prohibit a person suffering from tuberculosis, and who is in an infectious condition, from following any employment or occupation in connection with a dairy which would involve the milking of cows, the treatment of milk, or the handling of vessels used for containing milk. No formal action was necessary during the year. 18. MASS MINIATURE RADIOGRAPHY. I am indebted to Dr. Thompson, Medical Director of Unit 6D for the following report:- "Introduction During 1959 the Unit examined. 42,996 males and. 24,114 females, making a total of 67,110. Up to the end of 1959 the Unit has examined. 331,409 males and. 229,699 females - making a grand total of 561,108 since it commenced operations in May 1950. Sixty-six cases with significant tuberculous lesions have been discovered which gives a rate of .98 per 1,000 examinees. Fourteen cases of carcinoma of the lung were discovered during the year. The zone of the Unit has remained the same, viz. the City of London and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Finsbury and Shoreditch. The Unit carried out its usual procedure throughout the year, namely about nine months at the Mass Radiography Centre, 20 Golden Lane, E.C.l., with the remaining period (excluding three weeks holiday leave) allocated to various firms and organisations (See Table I). During the mobile period the Unit organised a co-operative Survey based at the Evening Standard when about ninety firms in the vicinity participated. A considerable number of new firms have been added to the Unit's register during the year and, in fact amounted to approximately 24% of the total number of firms X-rayed. As space, electric current and other services have to be provided by the firms visited we gratefully acknowledge all the assistance rendered by the organisations concerned. Doctor's Referrals General practitioners in our zone have continued to use the Unit's services and especially while the Unit operated at the Mass Radiography Centre. Such cases have' produced an incident rate of 12.4 per 1,000 examined. Medical Procedure The procedure adopted in previous years has been continued throughout 1959* All clinics have recorded their sputum findings, and twenty-two cases with a positive sputum have been recorded, of which twenty-one were male and one was female. Where an investigation was outside the province of a Chest Clinic, the co-operation of St. Bartholomews Hospital is secured, and I acknowledge iry indebtedness to Dr. N.C. Oswald and his colleagues. Staff Throughout the year the staff have carried out their duties conscientiously and efficiently and I would express my appreciation of their services. Conclusion Friendly relationships have been maintained with Dr.J.Greenwood Wilson, Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, the Medical Officers of Health for the Boroughs of Finsbury and Shoreditch, and the Divisional Medical Officers in Health Divisions 3» 4 and 5. The services rendered by the Central Group Hospital Management Committee and the Regional Hospital Board are gratefully acknowledged." 19. DETAILS OP SOME SURVEYS DURING 1959.

The various services to old age pensioners, provided by the Borough Council on a steadily expanding scale since 1947, have continued to be run by this Department, and are proving even more popular than before, with the Joint Welfare Committee still managing to cover the increasing expenditure on non-statutory contributions. An additional £80 of this expense was donated by the Shoreditch Association as a result of its annual Carnival. Our register of pensioners continues to contain almost 4,000 names, although the deletions are more readily obtained here than are the new additions, despite the enthusiasm of the three members of our staff occupied in visiting old people. Nevertheless, our visitors have again exceeded a total of 4,000 visits during the year. 20 The staff of our Old People's Clubs have continued to work well, and it is no mean feat to keep happy the members of 3 full-time clubs in addition to 4 part-time clubs'. However, an acceptable gift was received in the will of an ex-member of the Borough Welfare Committee which enabled us to purchase a portable television set and a portable record player for use in the clubs, and this has increased the amenities still further. The Bell Club members have watched with interest the erection of their new premises, and I hope to be able to give details of its opening and of its full amenities next year. The special weekly club for enfeebled old age pensioners, on Friday afternoons at Hoxton Hall, continued its Concert Artistes' Association shows to full houses, and the handicraft classes again raised £100 at their annual sale of work, in addition to presenting their annual 100 soft toys to the children's wards at Mile End Hospital (from the Haggerston Club). The Council's Holiday and Rest Home at Copthorne celebrated the year by being fully re-decorated, and gave at least two weeks' first-class food and fresh air to 954 persons in need of this help. (in this connection it is interesting to note that there were more than twice as many children between the ages of 9 months and 5 years, compared with the 1958 total). We had also some difficulty in accommodating all the applicants for the pensioners' Christmas fortnight there. Meals on Wheels distributed in half the Borough by the W.V.S., and in the other half by the Salvation Army, continued to help the homebound, and totalled, together with meals supplied at the three full-time clubs, about 500 a week, the pensioners paying l0d as before. The free laundry services further expanded, and the work continued to be done in a splendid manner at a nominal charge by St. Matthew's Hospital laundry. Free shoe repairs by the Lion Boys' Club were very popular with the pensioners, and the Health Department's supply of second-hand furniture was in great demand. This Department's 20 wheel chairs were in constant use, and a constant procession of blankets and mattresses passed through our stores. The delivery of library book3 and radios to the homebound continued to bring 'Light' into many lonely homes, the chiropodist adding 'power' to their feet and helping them to be able to attend clinics at a later date. Many other little amenities were given to individual old people through the enthusiasm of our visitors as required, and altogether we feel that life is becoming more worthwhile every year to the Shoreditch old people. All these services were of course in addition to those of the District Nursing Association, the L.C.C. Home Help Service and so forth, who contribute so much to the whole of London. We are indebted also to the trustees of the City of London & East London Dispensary for half the salary of one visitor, and to King Edward's Hospital Fund for their £300 towards the Holiday Home maintenance. 21.

The numbers of treatments carried out are shown in the following tables:- VERMINOUS PERSONS New Cases Total new cases Reattendances Total treatments 0 to 15 years Over 15 years - 2 2 - 2 SCABIES. New Cases Total new cases Reattendances Total treatments 0 to 15 years Over 15 years 6 6 12 7 19 (Until school-leaving age, the L.C.C. treat all affected children at their own Centre). 25. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The number of disinfections of rooms after infectious disease and for other reasons was 65. The number of articles disinfected in this connection at the Council's disinfector was 294. During the year 557 rooms were sprayed for verminous conditions and the number of articles disinfected was 10,850 In this connection sanitary notices were served in respect of 68 houses (121 rooms). In addition to the articles disinfected for infectious disease etc., the Department carried out disinfection of articles for private firms in the Borough, and various goods were disinfected, for which charges amounting to £24 were made. The new method of disinfection reported in 1956 continues to prove satisfactory and the economy in cost as compared with the previous methods was maintained. It is estimated that on a full year's working the saving is £170. During the year 457 families were removed to new housing accommodation on the Borough Council's housing estates, as compared with 354 families in 1958- This work entails a considerable amount of additional work for the staff. All furniture is disinfested by Hydrogen Cyanide prior to removal to the new accommodation by a firm of contractors under the supervision of the officers of the Department. When informed by the Housing Department of the families to be removed, an officer of the Public Health Department visits to ascertain the amount of furniture per family and to make arrangements as to whether one or more families can be removed in the one furniture van. By this means there is a considerable reduction in the cost of removals. The vans are usually met at 8 a.m. at a rendezvous on the date of removal and it is our duty to see that all the furniture is placed in the van and the tenant given instructions with regard to food as well as seeing that arrangements are made for the reception of soft goods after disinfestation has taken place. When the furniture is loaded on the van it is taken to the Disinfecting Station; the van is then sealed and charged with HON. The whole of the contents are disinfested for approximately four hours, the van is then opened, tested, and when clear of HCN the van moves to the new flat and the furniture is delivered. Soft goods (that is, bedding, mattresses etc.) which are collected at the same time as the furniture by the Borough Council disinfecting van, are disinfected by the Council's disinfecting apparatus and returned at the same time as the furniture. The next morning the whole of the furniture is chemically tested to make sure that the whole of the HCN has been removed from the furniture and furnishings. Much work has been done during the year in connection with the prevention of the breeding of cockroaches and beetles. Hot water ducts in 26. new Council flats provide a favourable breeding ground for cockroaches and beetles but by arrangement with the Borough Architect's Department insecticide powder is placed in the hot water ducts when they are being constructed. This method of control has proved to be very successful. The depositing of insanitary and other putrescible matter on vacant sites and other places by unauthorised persons is a practice which is not easily controlled and has been on the increase this year. This entails additional work for the Public Health Inspectorate. During the year the number of sites sprayed to prevent the breeding of flies on putrescible matter was 51. 137 articles of clothing, mattresses etc., were removed. HOUSING REPAIRS & BENTS ACT 1934. The Rent Act 1957 repealed Sections 23 to 32 of the Housing Repairs & Rents Act 1954 which dealt with Repairs Increase in respect of Controlled dwellings. Para. 3 (l) of the seventh schedule of the 1957 Rent Act authorised that any certificate of defects issued by a local authority made under the 1954 Act, being a certificate in force immediately before the commencement of the Rent Act 1957, shall, to the extent that it specifies any defects as regards the state of repair of any dwellings, have effect after the commencement of the Act of 1957• During the year 22 applications were made by owners for the revocation of certificates of defects granted by the local authority under the 1954 Act. In each case the dwellings were inspected and applications for revocation of the certificates were approved. RENT ACT 1957. The Rent Act 1957 has now been operative for three years and whilst the number of applications from tenants and landlords has decreased considerably, numerous enquiries from tenants and landlords have been received during the year. Inspections are made by the Public Health Inspectors prior to the issue of Certificates of Disrepair and Certificates of Revocation. No difficulties in operation have been experienced and again it is a pleasure to report that there has been no appeal by tenant or landlord against any decisions of the Council. 27. The following is a summary of work done during the yearAPPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR. Number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair 26 Number of decisions not to issue certificates 2 Number of decisions to issue certificates (a) in respect of some but not all defects 14 (b) in respect of all defects 10 Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 20 Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule - Number of Certificates issued 9 APPLICATIONS FOR CANCELLATION OF CERTIFICATES. Applications by landlord to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates 11 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 2 Decision by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objection - Certificates cancelled by Local Authority 9 As reported ]ast year, experience has further confirmed that the Rent Act has failed in raising- the standard of fitness of dwellings by placing the onus of determining defects of repair on the tenant and not upon the local authority. REGISTRATION OF HAIRDRESSERS. The number of Hairdressers registered in Shoreditch is 53. Regular inspections were made of all hairdressers and from the result of these inspections it was found that the standard of cleanliness observed in the hairdressing establishments in the Borough was reasonably high. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough is controlled by the Metropolitan Water Board and is relayed from public mains direct to houses. 28. PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS. Shoreditch has now only one swimming bath (indoor) "built in 1904 situated in Whiston Road, Haggerston, open all the year round for mixed bathing at all times. (Sunday swimming from May to September only). The pool is 100 feet long by 55 feet wide, constructed of blue and white glazed bricks, with a depth of 5 feet 4 inches at the shallow end, increasing gradually to 6 feet 4 inches at the deep end, at which there is one 5 metre fixed diving stage with 5 lower fixed boards at each side. The surround is 5 feet wide of non-slip tiles and seats rise in tiers from the surround up to the dressing cubicles at the back. The seats which are made of teak also form clothes lockers for use by children during peak periods. Male and female toilets and foot-baths are situated at each side of the pool at the shallow end. Entry to the pool from the dressing cubicles is via the toilets and footbaths and into the pool by teak steps fitted into each corner. The pool has a capacity of 109,000 gallons continuously filtered through pressure sand filters at the rate of 20,000 gallons per hour, chlorinated and heated to a temperature of 74°F. in summer and 78°. in winter. Chemical treatment of the pool is by Alumina Ferric and Sodium Carbonate. A Chlorine content of 1.0. to 1.5 parts per million is maintained during trade with a P.H. value of 7.6. Back washing of filters is done by air agitation of sand and washing through to waste by M.W.B. water from a main storage tank. The pool is emptied and re-filled as conditions and analysis reports dictate and averages once every four months. M.W.B. water is used for all purposes. Cleaning of the pool sides and bottom is carried out every morning before opening and during the day as circumstances permit. During the year 16 samples of water were taken from the bath and sent for bacteriological examination and 16 were sent to the Public Analyst. Results received from both laboratories showed the water to be satisfactory in every case. WELLS. There are two wells in use in the Borough. In one case the water is used for washing down and cooling purposes, and in the other case, which is a factory, the water from the well is used for all purposes. Samples of water from the latter well were taken for analysis and bacteriological examination and were found to be satisfactory. OFFENSIVE TRADE PREMISES. An establishment order under Section 140, Public Health (London) Act, 1956, was renewed during the year in respect of the business of a Fur Skin Dresser. The number of visits made was 6. 29. SHOPS ACT, 1950. Sub-Section (2) of Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950 requires that in every shop, not being a shop exempt from the provisions of this Sub-Section, there shall be provided and maintained suitable and sufficient sanitaiy conveniences available for the use of persons employed in or about the shop. Sub-Section (6) of Section 38 provides that a shop may be exempted from the provisions of Sub-Section (2) if there is in force a certificate exempting the shop therefrom granted by the authority whose duly it is to enforce those provisions. A certificate is granted if the authority are satisfied that by reason of restricted accommodation or other special circumstances it is not practicable to provide such accommodation on the premises and that alternative arrangements are conveniently available. One Certificate of exemption in respect of sanitary conveniences was issued during the year. The number of inspections and re-inspections made during the year was 64O. COMPULSORY REMOVAL OF AGED AMD INFIRM PERSONS. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are empowered to apply to the Court for an Order for the removal to hospital or other institution of a person who is aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, and who is living in insanitary conditions and "unable to devote to himself, and is not receiving from other persons proper care and attention". In addition, during 1951, the National Assistance (Amendment) Act came into force. Under this Act, on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and another practitioner, emergency removals of such people for periods not exceeding three weeks may be enforced by the Courts. No action under this Section was necessary during the year. RAG DEALERS. There are 11 premises in the Borough in which the business of Rag Dealer is carried out. 14 visits of inspection were made during the year. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. The Clean Air Act 1956 has been operative for three years and although eight notices were served during the year for smoke nuisances, the administration has worked smoothly and efficiently. 50. The operation of the Hyde Road Smoke Control Order took effect as from 1st September 1959. The Borough Council have agreed to a phased programme in order that the whole of Shoreditch may become a Smoke Control Area within the next seven years. Industry Many firms accept and act on convincing proof as to how to save money and yet maintain and perhaps improve existing standards. Experience in operating the Clean Air Act has established that the industrialist is co-operative on the question of smoke control and in no small measure this is the result of the Public Health Inspectors' policy of convincing them that upwards of 10% of fuel can be saved when burned efficiently. To the industrialist this is of vital importance, and of secondary importance is the amount of atmospheric pollution produced. However, this is the policy which the Public Health Inspectors have pursued throughout the year, to persuade the industrialist to burn fuel more efficiently, thereby saving- money and automatically complying with the purpose of the Act in reducing atmospheric pollution. It is encouraging once again to report satisfactory results concerning industrial undertakings without having resort to formal action. A vital problem which will have to be faced in the near future is the prevention of atmospheric pollution caused by the burning of wood wastes in the numerous small woodworking factories in Shoreditch, mentioned later in this report. Domestic dwellings The introduction of electric floor space heating in local authority flats under construction during the year is a marked advance in preventing atmospheric pollution and this, in addition to the foresight of the Council in providing approved appliances in all post-war local authority dwellings is an immense contribution towards Clean Air in Shoreditch. The refusal of the Minister to apply the grant for the alteration or replacement of fireplaces in respect of premises not in confirmed Smoke Control Areas despite pressure from various bodies including the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee has resulted during the year in several owners and occupiers anxious to provide approved appliances deciding not to do so until such time as the premises are in a confirmed Smoke Control Area when according to existing Law, the grant will be available. Smoke Control Areas The Hyde Road Smoke Control Area confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government became operative on 1st September 1959 and whilst it has been operative only four months it has presented few problems. Since 1st September 31. 1959 smoko observations were made in the Area and few instances of contravention were observed. In each of these isolated cases visits were made and assistance and advice was given to occupiers followed up by a letter of explanation. No reports of difficulties have been received in obtaining supplies of smokeless fuel. Phased programme of Smoke Control Areas Under Circular 5/59 dated 26th January 1959 the Minister of Housing and Local Government asked that Councils in black areas (Shoreditch is included under this categoiy) should now consider their domestic smoke problem as a whole (if they have not already done so) and decide on the smoke control orders that are needed, in what order of priority they should be made, and how many years it is likely to take to finish the job; and that they should then prepare a phased programme for establishing smoke control areas over the next five years. Councils in black areas were invited to inform the Minister by 50th June 1959 of their conclusions. This matter was considered by the Public Health Committee in Februaiy 1959 and upon recommendations made by the Chief Public Health Inspector it was decided to recommend to the Council that the whole of Shoreditch should become a Smoke Control Area and that this be done in s even s tages between i960 and 1966 in the priority as indicated on an accompanying map of the Borough. A copy of the proposals was forwarded to the Minister of Housing and Local Government. As local authorities were required to take immediate steps to administer and implement the Clean Air Act, a detailed house-to-house survey was undertaken to ascertain the number and types of premises, the number and types of fireplaces to be converted or adapted, the types of fuel used and information of fuel storage accommodation available. Two unqualified staff were engaged to carry out this survey under the supervision of the Chief Public Health Inspector. By the end of July a preliminary survey of Smoke Control Area No.2 was completed and the Chief Public Health Inspector reported that by the end of the year 5,652 premises had been surveyed as followsS- Smoke Control Area No.2 Other Premises in Borough Total Dwelling Houses 2715 2161 4876 Commercial Premises 225 189 414 Industrial Premises 127 200 327 Other Premises 16 19 35 Total 5652 In addition 425 re-visits were made where access presented difficulties. The number of fireplaces in No.2 Smoke Control Area requiring adaptation or replacement was 661 and the number of fireplaces not requiring adaptation or replacement was 1,509. 32. Estimated cost - No. 2 Smoke Control Area The preliminaiy estimated cost of adaptation or replacement of fireplaces was approximately £9,915• The local authority contribution would be £2,974 The owners' and occupiers' contribution would be £2,974 The Exchequer Grant would be £3,967 £9,915 The survey of the remaining areas continued during the year and by the end of the year the preliminary survey of the whole Borough was well under way and arrangements were being made to submit a recommendation to the Public Health Committee that No. 2 Area be approved in principle as a Smoke Control Area. Mechanical Stokers in Smoke Control Areas The Smoke Control Areas (Exempted Fireplaces) Order 1959» which became operative during the year, exempts mechanical stokers from smoke control area orders in the following teimst "Fireplaces, other than fireplaces fired by pulverized fuel, constructed on or after the Jlst day of December 1956, and equipped with mechanical stokers, or adapted on or after that date for use with such stokers, on condition that "the fireplace shall be so installed, maintained and operated as to minimize the emission of smoke. No fuel shall be used other than that for which the mechanical stoker was designed". This Order is applicable insofar as Shoreditch is concerned with regard to the boiler houses at Clinger Court, Bletchley Court and the London County Council Cranston Estate where underfeed mechanical stokers are operating. The disposal of wood waste in Smoke Control Areas A high percentage of atmospheric pollution in Shoreditch is due to the burning of sawdust and other wood wastes in numerous small furniture and other woodworking factories. Many of these possess open fireplaces, some slow combustion stoves, totally unsuitable for this purpose. Experience has shown that this practice serves a dual purpose - (a) to produce heating to the factory, heat glue pots etc. and (b) to dispose of wood wastes. Heating of course can be produced by other means such as gas, electricity and oil and smokeless fuel - and the wood wastes could be carted away either by the local authority at a reasonable charge as trade refuse or by private contractor. This economic factor is a real factor and a major problem in Shoreditch, but there can be no doubt that as Smoke Control Orders are confirmed it will have to be faced up to by the owners and occupiers of woodworking factories. In order to comply with the requirements of any confirmed Smoke Control Orders, the burning of wood wastes in the manner described above will have to cease 53. 34. OVERCROWDING AND PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT. At the end of 1958 the number of overcrowded cases on the Public Health Department register was 55> and the number of cases on the register for preferential treatment on medical grounds was 33« During the year eight new cases of families living in overcrowded conditions were found and added to the register, and a survey of all premises on the register revealed that 39 families had been rehoused or had found alternative accommodation themselves. Nine cases were removed from the preferential treatment register. The number of cases remaining on the overcrowding register at the end of the year was therefore reduced to 24, the number remaining on the preferential treatment register also being 24. 63 visits of inspection were made. UNDERGROUND ROOMS. No Closing Order in respect of underground rooms was made during the year. The total number of underground rooms on the register is now 761. FACTORIES aCTS, 1937 to 1959• Part I. During 1959» 105 new factories were added to the register and the names of 118 which had closed down or moved away were deleted; the number remaining at the end of the year was 1,174« Part VIII. 66 lists of outworkers were received from employers in the Borough, 33 in the first half-year due in February and 33 in the second half-year due in August. These lists contained the names of 797 persons of which 718 were not resident in Shoreditch, and details of these were forwarded to the sanitary authorities of the districts in which they lived. Lists were also received from 15 other Local Authorities containing the names of 406 outworkers who lived in Shoreditch but were employed by firms outside the borough. The total number of outworkers reported during the year was therefore 1,203. 195 visits of inspection were made to premises where outwoik was being carried on, but no defect necessitating the service of a sanitary notice was found. 35. Prescribed particulars on the administration of the Factories Act, 1937 in the form required by Ministry of Health Circular l/60 are as follows:- PART I of the Act. 1. Inspections.

HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. General observation was kept on the sale of heating appliances to ensure that they complied with the Regulations made under the above-named Act. In several cases the sellers and users of heating appliances requested that their guards be tested. The Chief Public Health Inspector made several tests of appliances at the request of manufacturers and others in the Borough. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT 1949. The rodent staff employed for this particular work consists of one rodent supervisor, Mr. Bryant (part-time), one investigator and two rodent operators. The whole of the sewer system throughout the Borough was treated and poison baiting was carried out twice during the year. The sewer maintenance treatment as reported last year was again carried out with a full scale Warfarin 5 treatment. The results being satisfactoiy, this method was again used during the sewer treatments in 1959 and has proved so satisfactory from many points of view that it will be continued. During the year 116 complaints were received of rat infestation and 80 of mice infestation. All complaints are thoroughly investigated, drains tested and the surrounding buildings surveyed, and where any old drains or drain outlets are found they are effectively sealed off from the sewer. In connection with rodent complaints received J20 drains were tested, in 166 cases it was found that the drainage was defective, as against 125 cases last year, and there has been a considerable increase in this work during the year which takes up a considerable amount of time for the whole of the staff. In all cases where defects were found Notices were served to remedy the defects. There has been a continued decrease of complaints regarding infestation by the ship rat. The system of arranging for contracts with business firms to assist them in rodent disinfestation was continued. During the period 1st April to Jlst December seven new contracts were entered into and three existing contracts were terminated. The income from contracts for the period was £1,168. 9' 0d. Charges for servicing business premises by single treatment carried out from 1st April to 31st December amounted to £115. At the end of the year contracts were in force for 64 premises yielding an annual income of £l,475*17*Od. 58. REPORT FOR PERIOD 1st APRIL - 31st DECEMBER, 1959.

This is in accordance with Ministry circular PDP/1959/l, in order that future reports may be made in respect of the calendar year instead of the financial year. 39. Details of treatment carried out are as follows- Business premises Dwellings. Rats Mice Rats Mice Warfarin trays laid 190 98 102 405 Traps set 60 468 38 84 Sewers.

Several complaints regarding nuisances from noise were made during the year. In all cases a satisfactory arrangement was made in connection with the use of machinery after inspections had been made by the Public Health Inspector. There was one complaint regarding noise from a juke-box, a warning was given to the operator and the nuisance was abated. FOOD HYGIENE. During 1959 the routine inspections under the Food Hygiene Regulations were carried out by the Specialist Food Inspector, (Mr. Harvey). The following is a list of the food premises in the Borough - Cafes and Restaurants 116 Factory and Warehouse Canteens 81 Ice Cream Shops (including 2 manufacturers) 118 Butchers shops and Stores 43 Milk Shops and Depots 87 Fried Fish Shops 8 Wet Fish Shops 6 Fish curing premises 4 Bakehouses 11 Food Warehouses 7 Grocery and Provision Shops 109 Confectioners Shops 102 Public Houses 121 Food Stalls 96 Coffee Stall 1 Chemists (including 2 Drug Stores) 21 Greengrocers 48 40. Some 3,538 visits of inspection were made and as a result 52 Notices of breaches of the Regulations were sent to the traders concerned and many improvements were made, the supervision of the cariying out of the remedial matters entailing a further 88 visits of re-inspection. The following items of work were completed and apparatus installed- Wash-hand basins provided 4 Sinks-not wash-hand basins-provided 1 Provision of hot water over sinks and wash-hand basins 4 Light and ventilation provided or increased 1 General repairs completed 12 Dirty floors cleaned, covered,repaired, etc. 8 Nail brushes provided 4 Premises or parts of premises redecorated 8 Improvements to urinals (Public Houses) 5 First-aid materials provided l Cleansing of equipment 10 Cleansing of Food Rooms 26 Refuse, abatement of nuisance due to storage 9 Drainage defects 4 The last Underground bakehouse ceased to operate on 31st December 1959 in consequence of a report by the Chief Public Health Inspector to the Public Health Committee on 2nd July 1959 when it was reported that the premises were unsuitable. The Public Health Committee decided to serve a Statutory Notice that the Certificate of Suitability should cease to have effect. After negotiations the occupier decided that the expense of bringing the basement bakehouse up to the required standard was excessive and submitted to the closing. The quality of foodstuffs sold and the general standard of hygiene maintained in i'ood premises is veiy good. The practice of distributing propaganda and education leaflets and posters in connection with hygiene to shopkeepers was continued and "NOW WASH YOUR HANDS" placques where required were supplied for fixing in the W.C. apartments. Regular and routine inspections were made to 81 Factory canteens as well as to the School Canteens and generally speaking all were being conducted and maintained to a veiy high hygienic standard. Regular samples of milk were obtained on delivery to the hospitals, schools and day nurseiy in the Borough, and submitted for chemical and bacteriological examination. Street traders Constant supervision was kept on all stalls where food is sold and regular inspections were made of the food storage accommodation occupied by stall holders. The food traders operating from stalls are most co-operative 41. and are always willing to make improvements and maintain a high standard of hygiene. There is only one "coffee stall" in the Borough situated at the corner of Calvert Avenue. This is in a way of being an historic "institution" of the past, known throughout the East End as "Syd's Coffee Stall". The standard of hygiene is excellent and is well maintained. During the year many improvements were made in the sanitary accommodation for customers at the 121 Public Houses in the Borough as a result of regular inspections. Four samples of ice cream were taken for analysis and all conformed to a high standard. Chemical Analysis of Food 229 samples were submitted to the Public Analyst during the year, giving a rate of 5*3 per 1,000 population. These were as follows?- Baking Powder 1; Beverage, Chocolate drink 1J Blancmange 1; Brandy l; Bread 2; Butter 8; Cake mixture 1; Cheese spread l; Coffee, essence 1; Cooking fat 1, Confectionery flour lj Cornflour 1; Cream 1, Custard Powder 3> Dessert Powder 1; Drinks, soft 2; Figs, syrup of lj Fish cake 1; Fish paste 2; Fruit juice, canned tomato 1} Gin Glucose 1; Gravy preparation 1; Honey 1; Ice Cream 4> lce lolly 2; Lard 1;-Margarine 45 Meat Products 8; Milk 116; Milk, condensed 2; Oil, cooking 1} Pea Flour 1; Peanut Butter 1#Peanuts 1} Pease Pudding, canned l; Pepper l; Proprietary food, Vitacup l; Rice 1; Rum l; Sauce 3> Semolina 1} Soda, bicarbl l; Soup, canned 6; Soup preparation 2; Spices 25» Suet, shredded lj Tapioca 1; Vinegar, malt 2; Whisky 3; A sample of ground nutmeg was found to contain 20^> semolina and proceedings were taken against the Vendor who could not produce invoice or warranty. She was granted an absolute discharge on payment of two guineas costs. Several other samples of nutmeg taken were found to be adulterated and warning letters were sent to producers. A warning letter was sent to a Vendor in respect of butter which contained .2$ excessive water. The present and increasing trend of pre-packed food which is in the hands of a small number of manufacturers means that much more thought is required in procuring samples for analysis. Most large manufacturers have their own laboratories with full-time chemists, which ensures that generally all foodstuffs packed conform to the required legal standards. This particularly applies to milk especially in the London area and it is this fact which has contributed to a very considerable reduction in adulteration and sophistication of food. Luring the year there were no seizures of unsound food. All food inspected and found unsound and unfit for human consumption w as voluntarily surrendered. The amount of food surrendered and examined by the Public Health 42. Inspectors was considerable, 428 certificates being issued in respect of the following!- Meat 287 tins; 3 cwts, 3 qtrs, 16 Its.; Meat Products 154 tins, 32 lbs., Bacon 138 cwts. 1 qtr.; Pork 15 tins, 3 cwts. 1 qtr 10 lbs; Ham 292 tins, 2 cwts. 2 qtrs. 26 lbs; Cheese 25 cwts. 2 qtrs. 21 lbs.; 33 packets; Peas 50 tins; 1 cwt. 1 qtr. 6 lbs; Split peas 28 lbs; Butter beans 3 qtrs. 10 lbs; Mixed Vegetables 293 tins; Macaroni 1 cwt. 3 qtrs. 14 lbs; Rice 9 cwts. 24 lbs; Sago 48 lbs; Farinoca 28 lbs; Tapioca 5 cwts. 2 qtrs; Lentils 10 cwts. 21 lbs; Cereals 9 cwts. 1 qtr. 23 lbs; Fruit 1,422 tins; Dried fruit 28 cwts. 3 qtrs. 8 lbs; Tomatoes 24I tins; 12 lbs; Soup 48 tins; Fish 75 tins; Crab 221 tins; Prawns 3 tins; Shrimps 3 lbs; Flour 37 packets; 3 cwts. 2 lbs; Ground almonds 72 lbs; Jam & Marmalade 107 jars; Coconut 80 lbs; Lard 92 lbs; Sugar 42 lbs; Cake mixture 222 packets; 72 lbs; Peanut butter 43 jars; Rusks 50 packets; Evaporated milk 704 tins; Plum puddings 255 Mayonnaise 12 tubes. In order to prevent waste where possible, most of the unsound food is allowed to be distributed to recognised dealers for the recovery of fat and other waste products. In all cases the local authority in whose area the dealers' premises are situated are notified when unsound food is sent. It is pleasing to note that the public are bringing to the Public Health Department any articles of food which appear to the purchaser to be not of the nature, or not of the substance demanded, or contain apparent foreign substances. An increasing number of articles of food were submitted but upon inspection were found to be fit for food. In two cases Court proceedings were instituted, one - bread containing a metal clip, and the other bread containing a dead cockroach. In the first case the defendant was given an Absolute Discharge, and in the second case the defendant was fined £10 and ordered to pay three guineas costs. A tin of ham examined as a control sample to determine method of dealing with remaining stock was found to have deteriorated and to be unfit for human consumption. Remaining stock was surrendered. PRESERVATIVES IN FOOD REGULATIONS. All articles taken were in accordance with the regulations. ANTI-FLY CAMPAIGN. The campaign to combat the fly nuisance was continued. By arrangement, and with the co-operation of the Transport & Cleansing Superintendent all dustbins and dust chutes were dusted during the fly-breeding season with Gammexane after the receptacles had been emptied by the Council's refuse collectors. Owners of blocks of flats were again encouraged to take action against flies, by purchasing insecticide supplied by the Public Health Department at cost price. Fly sprays were also sold to occupiers of food premises- 45. FREE WASHING FACILITIES. Free washing facilities are installed in every public sanitaryconvenience in the Borough. These facilities are being made use of by an increasing number of users of the conveniences and are a regular feature in the use of public conveniences. PHARMACY AMD POISONS ACT, 1933. 40 Licences were granted during the year. 45 Inspections and visits were made, and general observation was kept of stalls and shops for unauthorised sellers, but no infringements were reported. PHARMACY AND MEDICINES ACT, 1941. Throughout the year a watch was kept for contraventions of the Act, but none was observed. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT, 1926, ORDERS. General observation was kept of all stalls and shops in the Borough where foodstuffs scheduled under these Orders were exposed for sale. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951• There were twelve premises licensed under this Act during the year. In eight cases a considerable business is carried on, mostly in budgerigars and goldfish, but the other four deal on a very small scale only, two in dogs and the other two in pigeons. During the year 22 inspections were made of these premises, and in no case were the conditions of the licence being contravened. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. At the end of 1959 the number of registered premises where filling materials were used was 119 > and during the year 15 licences were issued in respect of premises where rag flock is manufactured or stored. 198 Inspections of the premises were made. 16 Samples of filling materials were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst. All were found to comply with the prescribed standards. PUBLIC HEALTH PROPAGANDA. During the year Public Health propaganda was continued. Health propaganda posters were posted and regularly changed from time to time on the Public Health notice boards which are fixed in positions on 44- the Council's housing estates. There is also a large notice board situated at the Town Hall and also one at St.John's churchyard. In addition to this, Public Health leaflets have been distributed through the courtesy of the Borough Librarian at the Public Libraries. During the year food hygiene circulars have been distributed to all shopkeepers and stall holders and "Do Not Spit" notices have been distributed to owners of blocks of flats. Articles have been written and published in the "Newsletter" and in all cases of infectious disease food handlers' pamphlets are distributed. PAID FUPILLAGE. The system of paid pupillage continued, and two trainees were successful in passing the Statutoiy examination, one in July and the other in December. Both were appointed as Public Health Inspectors to fill vacancies in the establishment and are giving good service to the department. The student training scheme under which juniors appointed as clerks are given the opportunity to train as Public Health Inspectors was also continued. The student who failed to qualify in 1958 was called up for National Service in February, but continued to study and successfully passed the examination in December. Two new students commenced their course of training in September. Since the beginning of these schemes, 4 trainees and 8 students have been trained and all have successfully passed the examination.
