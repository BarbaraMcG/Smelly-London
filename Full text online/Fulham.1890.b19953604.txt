The Law and Parliamentary Committee, reported to the Vestry on the 11th April, 1890, that they had ordered the question of the claim of the Copyholders to stand over, pending the decision of the London County Council. At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 30th April, a letter was received from the London County Council, inviting a deputation to attend a meeting of the Parks and Open Spaces Committee, with reference to the Lammas Lands, and a deputation was accordingly appointed. The Parks and Open Spaces Committee having informed the deputation that they (the Committee) could not recommend the Council to take the necessary legal proceedings to secure the Lammas rights over the Town Meadows, unless the Vestry took the initiative, the Vestry, on the 14th May, 1890, resolved to pay £1,000 towards the cost of trying the action, unless the amount was raised by voluntary subscription, on condition that the London County Council afterwards took the whole case in hand, and defrayed all further costs in the matter. On the 11th June, 1890, the Vestry further resolved, that inasmuch as the £1,000 has not been raised by public subscription, the London County Council be informed that the Vestry undertake to pay £1,000 towards the cost of trying the action, on condition that the Council afterwards take the whole case in hand, and defray all further costs in the matter. At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 9th July, 1890,. a resolution moved by Mr. Hunt, and seconded by Mr. Spokes: That it be referred to the Lammas Rights Committee to make the necessary arrangements to poll the parish, and invite the ratepayers to say "yes" or "no" to the proposed expenditure of £1,000, was lost, whereupon Mr. Hunt asked that his protest against the Vestry voting the £1,000 without appealing to the ratepayer, 16 might be entered on the minutes. On the 6th August, 1890, the Lammas Rights Committee recommended the Vestry— That, having received a letter from the London County Council, enquiring if the Vestry had asked the adjoining parishes to contribute towards the expenses of trying the Lammas Rights question, the Vestries of Kensington, Chelsea, and Hammersmith be written to, and asked to contribute the sum of £500 each towards the cost. At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 17th September, 1890, the question of taking action in the matter of the connection of the drainage of Messrs. Lowenfeld's brewery with the Vestry's sewer in Town Mead Road, was referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee to take the necessary action to maintain the Vestry's rights; and at the same meeting the Clerk read letters (1) from the Hammersmith Vestry, declining to take any action with reference to subscribing towards the cost of an action, and (2) from the Chelsea Vestry, that they had no power to subscribe as requested. The Clerk was, on the 1st October, 1891, instructed to write to London County Council, as follows:— 1. Informing them of the decisions of the Hammersmith and Chelsea Vestries, with reference to contributing towards the cost of maintaining the rights over the Lammas Lands. 2. Asking them if they have yet considered the offer of this Vestry to contribute £1000 towards the cost of an action, on condition that they take the whole matter up, and whether they will inform the Vestry what they intend doing. 3. Informing them that the Vestry have decided to take 6 horses to graze on the Lammas Lands, to assert the Lammas Rights. 4. Pointing out that, owing to the enclosures which are being made on the Lammas Lands, immediate action is necessary. The following report of the Lammas Rights and Open Spaces Committee was adopted by the Vestry on the 29th October, 1890:— That, having received a letter from the Kensington Vestry, stating that although they fully sympathise with the movement to secure the Lammas Lands as an open space, they do not consider the interests of the Parish of Kensington sufficiently involved to justify them in making any contribution towards the cost of an action, it be reported to the London County Council. That the Clerk write to the London County Council again, asking them if they will kindly inform the Vestry what steps they intend to take with reference to the Lammas Rights in this Parish, and further inform them that this Vestry considers the time has now arrived when some immediate action should be taken, and trusts they will enter into an action with those at present occupying the Lands. On the 26th November, 1890, the Vestry instructed the Surveyor to carry out the resolution of the Vestry of the 17th September, 1890, as to the Vestry's hoises grazing on the Lammas Lands, as soon as convenient, before the next meeting of the Lammas Rights, &c., Committee; and at the same meeting appointed a deputation to wait on the Board of Works for the Hackney District to ask them for information respecting a certain action they brought in the Court or Appeal, in which Sir Charles Bussell was retained as counsel, with success to the Board. On the 10th December, 1890, the Surveyor reported that he (in company wrth Mr. Jones, Superintendent of Boads, and Mr. March, 17 the Chairman of the Lammas Rights and Open Spaces Committee) attended on the 1st December, 1890, at 3 p.m., with six horses belonging to the Vestry, at the bottom of Peterborough Lane, and then described the course taken in leading the horses over the Lammas Lands; and, in reply to various letters received with reference to the action of the Surveyor in asserting the rights of Lammas over certain property on the 1st December, and asking whether the Surveyor was acting by the instructions of the Vestry, and, if so, who would accept process, the Vestry instructed the Clerk to inform the writers of the resolution of the Vestry authorising the action of the Surveyor, and giving them the name and address of the Vestry's solicitor. On the 14th January, 1891, the following letter was received from the London County Council:— Spring Gardens, S.W., 4th December, 1890. Sir, I have laid before the Parks and Open Spaces Committee your letter of the 3rd ultimo, asking what steps the Council intend to take with reference to the assertion of Lammas rights in connection with the Town Meads, Fulham. In reply, I have to inform you that the Council's Solicitor is making inquiries as to the evidence which would be forthcoming, and will lay the same before Counsel, for him to advise as to the sufficiency of such evidence and the best mode, if any, of commencing an action to assert the Lammas rights. On the receipt of Counsel's opinion, the Committee will make a recommendation to the Council in the matter. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. DE LA HOOKE, Clerk to the Council. The Lammas Rights and Open Spaces Committee reported to the Vestry on the 21st of January, 1891, as follows:— That, having considered a letter from the Assistant Solicitor to the London County Council, asking for the names and addresses of any person or persons who can remember turning out their cattle on the Town Meadows, they have instructed the Clerk to advertise for information in the West London Observer and Fulham Chronicle, and have resolved to meet on Tuesday, the 20th inst., at 7.30 p.m., the Clerk in the meantime to write to any persons whom he thinks possess any knowledge on the subject, inviting their attendance, so that their evidence may be taken down. That having received a letter from Mr. John Lirnpus, of 13, Barclay Road, stating that he had been in the habit of turning out his cattle on the Town Meads without his rights being disputed; they have instructed the Clerk to forward a copy of the letter to the London County Council, together with any further information he may be able to get by interviewing Mr. Limpus. That having taken down certain information respecting the Lammas Lands, given by Mr. Walden, they have instructed the Clerk to transmit a copy of same to the Solicitor of the London County Council. That having interviewed Mr. Bichard Bull, of Peterborough Cottages, Bagley's Lane, Fulham; Mr. George Ward, Contractor, Bagley's Lane, 18 Sands End, Fulham; Mr. Samuel King, 39, Avalon Road, Fulham; and Mr. Richard Devin, of 4, Sandilands Road, Fulham—all of whom testified as to having grazed their cattle on the Town Meads for many years past they have instructed the Clerk to forward a copy of their evidence to the Solicitor to the London County Council. Messrs. Last & Son having written to the Solicitor to the Vestry, asking whether the Yestry intended from time to time to assert the alleged Lammas Rights, and, if not, that their Clients were prepared to receive an apology, if made at once, and discontinue the actions, the letter was referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee. Bishop's Meadow. At a meeting of the Yestry held on the 28th May, 1890, the Clerk read a letter from the London County Council, asking whether the Yestry would be willing to convey the Bishop's Meadow to the Council, and to subscribe <£1,000 towards the cost of laying out the ground in the event of the Council being willing to build a river wall, and defray the remainder of the cost of laying out the grounds, and also the cost of their future maintenance. It was resolved— That a letter be written to the London County Council, stating that the Yestry were willing to accede to the terms so far as they legally could. On the 23rd July, 1890, the Works and General Purposes Committee reported to the Yestry that they had instructed the Surveyor to write to Messrs. Cluttons, enquiring if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners would convey the West Meadow to the London County Council instead of to this Yestry as proposed, and consent to the Vestry also conveying the Bishop's Meadow to the London County Council, and at the meeting of the Vestry held on the 6th August, 1890, the Surveyor read a letter from Messrs. Cluttons with reference to the transfer of the Bishop's and West Meadows to the London County Council, a copy of which was ordered to be sent to the London County Council. On the 7th January, 1891, the Yestry resolved that the London County Council be memorialised to reconsider their decision with reference to the embankment of the Bishop's Meadow, and asked to receive a deputation from the Yestry on the subject, and that the Clerk be instructed to draft a memorial pointing out that the offer of the Yestry to contribute £1,000 was on the distinct understanding that it was to be part of the cost of the embanking as well as the laying out; that the land was conveyed to the Yestry on condition that a riverwall should be constructed; the metropolitan aspect of the improvement ; that the land is being encroached upon by the river; and any other essential points which occur to him. The Lammas Bights and Open Spaces Committee reported to the Yestry that they had received a letter from the London County Council giving the decision of the Council with reference to the laying out and embanking of the Bishop's Meadow, and had referred the same to the Law and Parliamentary Committee with a view to the memorialising of the London County Council to reconsider their decision with reference to the river wall. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners having written stating that unless steps were taken by the Vestry, without further delay, to lay out the Bishop's and West Meadow, they would be compelled to name an early date after which the offer must be withdrawn, the Lammas Bights Committee referred the matter 19 to the Works Committee, with a recommendation to take some immediate action as to levelling the ground and having a fence put up adjoining the moat, which recommendation was reported to the Yestry on February 11th, 1891. A Deputation, consisting of Messrs. Cornwall, March, Littleboy, Margrie, Lawrence, Wingrave, Beckett, Weatherley, Long, and the Bev. W. P. Hindley, was appointed to wait upon the London County Council with reference to the embanking of the Bishop's Meadow; and in the event of the London County Council declining to bear the whole of the cost of the river wall, the spokesman of the Deputation was authorised to suggest that the Yestry would entertain an offer from the London County Council to subscribe a moiety of the cost. The Surveyor was instructed to prepare and send to the London County Council a plan showing the Freehold and proposed Leasehold portion of the land (Bishop's and West Meadow), together with a copy of the Conveyance of the Bishop's Meadow of 1884, and a copy of the letter of Messrs. Cluttons, dated March, 1888, stating that the Yestry consider that the grant of the land was on condition that a river wall should be built. Footpath between Peterborough Lane and Town Mead Boad. The Surveyor was, on the 23rd July, 1890, instructed by the Yestry to place boundary stones on the footpath between Peterborough Lane and Town Mead Road, and to request Mr. Jeremiah Langston to witness the laying of the stones, he to be allowed the sum of Five Shillings for so doing. On the 1st October, 1890, the Law and Parliamentary Committee reported to the Yestry that, having considered a letter from Mr. F. Robinson, Miss Sullivan's Solicitor, with reference to the footpath between Peterborough Lane and Town Mead Road, they have instructed the Surveyor to call upon Mr. Robinson and see the plans which he offers to show, and report at the next meeting of the Committee; and at the following meeting the Surveyor reported the result of his interview with Mr. Robinson with reference to the footpath, and the Committee instructed their Solicitor to see the title deeds in the possession of Miss Sullivan's Solicitor, and also to take steps to obtain evidence to establish rights over this public footpath at a cost not exceeding £25, and to report thereon to the Committee at its next meeting, which he did, stating that Mr. Robinson had promised to obtain the deeds with reference to the footpath, and arrange an appointment when he could see them. On the 26th November, 1890, the Solicitor having reported hereon, the Clerk was instructed to write Mr. Robinson, stating that the Yestry had caused full enquiries to be made and were of opinion that the footpath adjoining the carriageway was a highway, and that he must not, either by himself or his clients, interfere with the free user of the said highway by the public, and the Yestry also instructed the Surveyor to have the path repaired. On the 7th January, 1891, the Clerk produced to the Law and Parliamentary Committee communications which he had received from Mr. Robinson with reference to this matter, and they instructed the Solicitor to reply to same. On the 18th March, 1891, the Surveyor reported to the Yestry that on the 16th March, 1891, a wooden barrier was found erected across the Town Mead Road footpath, which he (the Surveyor) had had removed. 20 Medical Officer of Health. The Sanitary Committee reported to the Vestry on the 11th June, 1890, that they had received a letter from the Local Government Board with reference to the Annual Beport of the Medical Officer of Health, and that they had instructed the Clerk to inform the Local Government Board that a copy of their letter had been handed to the Medical Officer of Health to attend to; that the Yestry were unable to send a copy of the Annual Beport, as it had not at present been submitted to the Yestry; and further, that their Medical Officer of Health stated that the delay was owing to the non-receipt of the Begistrar General's Beturn re Births and Deaths up to the 31st December, 1889. On the 1st October, 1890, the Sanitary Committee reported to the Yestry that they had received a letter from the Local Government Board forwarding copy of a letter received by them from the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the Poor, with reference to a complaint made by the Council to the Yestry regarding the condition of certain houses in Victoria and Bulow Boads, and the Clerk was instructed to forward a certified copy of the Medical Officer of Health's Beport on the subject to the Local Government Board for the information of the Mansion House Council. At the meeting of the Yestry, held on the 7th January, 1891, it was resolved : "That the Yestry call upon Dr. Egan to resign his Medical Officership on the 31st March, 1891, and that the Local Government Board be so informed." On the 21st January, 1891, the Clerk read a letter from the Local Government Board, with reference to the resolution of the Yestry calling upon Dr. Egan to resign, and asking to be informed under what circumstances the Yestry passed the resolution, and pointing out that the Medical Officer of Health could not be dismissed without their consent. It was resolved, that the letter be referred to the Sanitary Committee to reply to, which was done on the 27th January, 1891, and it was reported to the Yestry on the 11th February, 1891, that the same had been replied to, when a resolution that the charges made in the letter be printed and circulated amongst the members of the Yestry, marked "Private and Confidential," was lost, 7 voting for and 22 against. On the 18th February, 1891, the Clerk read to the Yestry a letter from the Local Government Board, enclosing copy of a letter which the Board had received from Mr. E. G. Easton, stating that the charges made against Dr. Egan had not been confirmed by the Yestry, and asking for an explanation; whereupon it was moved by Mr. Weatherley, and seconded by Mr. Margrie, that the Clerk be instructed to forward to the Local Government Board, a copy of the Yestry's resolution passed as under, that they have approved of and instructed the Clerk to forward to the Local Government Board the reply of the Yestry to their letter of the 14th January, 1891, with reference to the Medical Officer of Health, to which an amendment was moved by Mr. Easton, and duly seconded, that the Local Government Board be informed that at the time of sending the charges to them the Yestrv had not confirmed the charges, but that they have since confirmed them, but, that twothirds of the members had not seen them or known their substance, but on being put to the vote the amendment was declared lost, 6 voting for it and 30 against; the original motion was then carried with the addition—and that the Local Government Board be informed that their letter was referred by the Yestry to the Sanitary Committee to reply to, and that the Sanitary Committee is a committee consisting of the whole of the members of the Vestry. 21 The Sanitary Committee reported to the Vestry on the 4th March, 1891, that as the Medical Officer of Health had not submitted to the Sanitary Committee the reports he was instructed to make as follows:— Be Section 26 Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890. „ Bakehouses. „ Houses, Burnthwaite Bow. „ 56, Rosaline Road. „ Mews, 40, Moore Park Road. „ Crown Court. „ Questions asked by Inspector Grigg. „ Alleged insanitary areas, this Committee considers it absolutely impossible to conduct its business, and recommends that the Medical Officer of Health be suspended from the discharge of his duties, and that the same be forthwith reported to the Local Government Board, the Clerk to supply the dates on which the Medical Officer of Health was first ordered to report on the above matters, and any further dates on which he has been instructed to report on these matters since the charges were sent to the Local Government Board; which report was adopted, and Dr. J. B. Hill was appointed to carry out the duties of the Medical Officer of Health during the suspension of Dr. Egan. On the same date the Clerk read a letter from the Local Government Board, stating that a copy of the Yestry's charges had been forwarded to Dr. Egan for his observations, and on the 18th March, 1891, the Clerk read a letter from the Local Government Board acknowledging the communication as to the suspension of the Medical Officer of Health, and stating that the matter was receiving attention. Accommodation for Churchwardens and Overseers. On the 16th April, 1890, the Yestry, on the recommendation of the Finance Committee, resolved that the Churchwardens and Overseers be charged £150 per annum as rent, etc., for their proposed offices in the Town Hall, and on the 11th June, the Town Hall Committee reported that, having viewed the new Town Hall and offices with regard to the accommodation to be offered to the Churchwardens and Overseers, the room already allotted for the staff of the Rating Department (to be fitted as per Architect's plan) be set apart for the Churchwardens and Overseers, and also that they have the use of the SubCommittee Room for Committee Meetings, the whole at a rental of £80 per annum, which report was adopted by the Yestry by 30 votes to 10. The Town Hall Committee having again considered the accommodation to be provided for the Churchwardens and Overseers at the Town Hall, recommended the Vestry, on the 9th July, 1890, that the Churchwardens and Overseers be offered the use of the New Streets Surveyor's Private Office, and the Storage Room in the basement, in addition to the large room already allotted to them, for the sum of £80 per annum, and that, in order to carry out the above recommendation, the rooms allotted to the Accountant be given to the New Streets Surveyor, and the Accountant placed in the New Streets Surveyor's General Office; which recommendation was adopted by 16 votes to 3. At the meeting of the Yestry, held on the 1st October, 1890, the Clerk was instructed to furnish the Solicitor with the necessary information for the drawing up of a draft agreement, to be entered into between the Yestry and Churchwardens and Overseers, with reference to their office accommodation at the Town Hall. 22 On the 29th October, 1890, the Town Hall Committee reported that having considered the letter from the Churchwardens and Overseers, with reference to the fittings to be placed in their room, and as to the additional accommodation required for the Yestry Clerk, they had delegated their powers to a Committee consisting of Messrs. Haines, Abery, Cornwall, Curtis, and Weatherley, to meet and confer with the Churchwardens and Overseers thereon, who reported as follows:— That the Churchwardens and Overseers, together with the Committee delegated by the Town Hall Committee, have agreed to the following arrangements, and referred the matter to the Architect to carry out:— 1. That the Churchwardens and Overseers have the room situated on the ground floor, opposite the Rates Department, at present occupied by the Accountant. 2. That such room and staircase be separated by a glazed partition. 3. That the Accountant have his present private office and also the plan-room now occupied by the Surveyor. 4. That the Churchwardens and Overseers be permitted to arrange with the Architect as to the fitting of the large room, now used by the Rates Department. 5. That the Sub-Committee room be no longer used by the Churchwardens and Overseers. 6. That the Churchwardens and Overseers have for the purpose of storage the room in the basement, opposite the strong room, the same to be fitted with an iron door, slate shelves and two gas brackets. 7. That the Churchwardens and Overseers pay £120 per annum, for the above accommodation, inclusive of gas, cleaning and fuel. Town Hall. At the meeting of the Yestry, held on the 31st July, 1890, the Town Hall Committee reported that they had had under consideration the question of the appointment of a Manager for the Stage Plays at the Town Hall, who would be required to enter into a bond with two sureties in the sum of <£400 with the London County Council, in accordance with the regulations of the London County Council thereon, and recommended that the Clerk to the Yestry oe appointed such Manager, which recommendation was unanimously adopted by the Vestry. The New Offices having been completed and the major portion of the furniture provided, possession was taken thereof by the Yestry; on the 29th September, 1890, the Yestry Meeting was first held in the New Town Hall. The Town Hall Committee having had under consideration the question of the Scale of Charges and Conditions and Regulations for the Letting of the Town and Concert Hall, produced their report to the Vestry at the meeting held on the 15th October, 1890, when the Scale of Charges, &c., were adopted, with the exception of the charges relating to religious services on Sundays, which were expunged, and the same were confirmed; and at the same meeting of the Vestry the Clerk to the Yestry, Mr. W. J. H. Denselow, was appointed by the Vestry as responsible officer to the A estry, in charge of the offices and general ariangements of the new Town Hall, and the form of application for and list of duties of the Hall and Assistant Hallkeepers were confirmed, and advertisements were ordered to be issued in the papers at once for such officers. 23 At a Special Meeting of the Vestry held on the 6th November, 1890, the Conditions and Regulations for the Town Hall were amended by the rescinding of Clause 5, which provided for the right of entry of the members of the Letting Committee, the Clerk to the Vestry, and the Surveyor, who were to be provided with pass tickets, and to have power to enter at all times except during Masonic Meetings, on production of the said pass, and a resolution moved by Mr. Cranfield, and seconded by Mr. Spokes, that the Letting Committee reserve to themselves, the Clerk to the Vestry, and the Surveyor, the right of entry to meetings at all times, except at Masonic Meetings, not more than two to be present on one occasion, was, on being put to the vote, declared lost. On the 29th October, Mr. J. Brownlee was appointed Hallkeeper, and Mr. L. J. C. Davies Assistant Hallkeeper, in accordance with the terms of the advertisement. On the 17th October, 1890, the London County Council granted to William John Hellier Denselow, of 22, Coniger Road, Parson's Green, S.W., the licence for the purpose of stage plays at the Town Hall, he having entered into a bond with his two sureties, Messrs. Richard Edward Cranfield and James Spraggs, for the due performance of the rules in force of such managership. The Architect was, on the 26th November, 1890, instructed by the Yestry to obtain estimates for the fitting of the offices and strong-room to be used by the Churchwardens and Overseers, from not less than six firms, exclusive of Messrs. Giles and Co.; and on the 10th December, 1890, the tender of Mr. W. Marks, of 262, North End Road, for the fitting of the Overseers' offices and strongroom, in accordance with the plans and specifications prepared by the Architect, was produced at the Vestry; but a resolution that it be referred back to the Town Hall Committee, with an instruction to alter the specification, was carried by 19 votes to 12. The Architect having been instructed to bring up a plan and estimate for a portable platform and side screens in the Concert Hall, the Yestry, on the 26th November, resolved that the platform and side screens be provided for the Concert Hall, in accordance with the Architect's plans, &c. On the 10th Decexnber, 1890, the Yestry, on the recommendation of the Letting Comxnittee, resolved that whenever the Refreshment Rooxn adjoining the small Hall is required by the hirer of the large Hall, an additional fee of 10s. 6d. be charged, but that xt be included free in the letting of the small Hall, and at the same time the motion of Mr. March, seconded by Dr. Cooney, "That in Rules No. 1 and 2, relating to the Town Hall, the words ' for which no tickets shall be issued ' be added after the word 'free,'" was carried. The Town Hall and Offices were, by order of the Vestry, open for the inspection of ratepayers from the 5th to the 10th of January, 1891, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on each day, and members of the Letting Committee were in attendance on those days, but very few ratepayers availed themselves of the privilege accorded by the Vestry. The Architect having reported to the Vestry on the 1st October, 1890, that the time for the completion of the furnishing of the Town Hall expired on the 17th September, the Clerk was instructed to inform the contractors that as the work had not been completed they were liable to a penalty of £25 per week; and on the 15th October, 1890, the Clerk reported to the Vestry that he had received a letter from Messrs. Giles and Co. with regard to the enforcing of the 24 penalty clause in the contract, which they asked the Vestry not to enforce, as a portion of the delay was through no fault of theirs; the same was ordered to be referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee. On the 29th October, 1890, the Vestry, on the recommendation of the Law and Parliamentary Committee, instructed the Solicitor to write to Messrs. Giles & Co., informing them that the penalties would be strictly enforced. The Solicitor for the Vestry reported on the 12th November, 1890, that in accordance with the instructions, he communicated with Messrs. Giles & Co., informing them that it was the Vestry's intention to insist on the payment of the penalty for non-completion of their contract, to which letter they had replied informing him that they were doing their utmost to finish as speedily as possible, and that they greatly regretted the inconvenience caused to the Members and Officers of the Yestry; and on the same date the Architect, on the recommendation of the Town Hall Committee, was instructed by the Vestry to arrange with Messrs. Benham & Froud to fix the pendants in the large hall by the 20th November, and in the event of their being unable to complete them by that time, to have them fixed as soon after as possible; and that instead of Messrs. Giles & Co. carrying out the fixing of the gas fittings, Messrs Benham & Froud be instructed to fix their own fittings. On the 10th December, 1890, the Yestry accepted the tender of the Excelsior Window Cleaning Company for cleaning the windows of the Town Hall for one year, at £2 10s. per month. On the 14th January, 1891, the Clerk produced the following letter, which he had received from Messrs. Giles & Co.:— 50 to 56, Kensington High Street, W. J. H. Denselow, Esq., December 20th, 1890. Fulham Town Hall. Dear Sir, We were much surprised to-day to find that the Architect to the Board had deducted the sum of £325 (13 weeks' penalty) from our certificate. W ith reference to this deduction we desire to inform you that, although the entire contract was not completed in time, yet the Vestry had the use of the greater portion by the time specified, and the delay of those goods not delivered was occasioned by our having to make no less than three (3) different samples for the approval of Mr. Edwards after the contract had been signed. In addition, up to this date, December 20th, the coil cases are not complete, i.e., not ready for us to fix in the small Hall. We are not supplying these, but have to fix them only (which forms a part of our contract); further, instead of there being 20 as specified, upwards of 50 have been supplied, and we have had to withdraw our men on various occasions waiting for them—in fact, the iron tops for the cases were only delivered on the 18th instant. The last gas brackets (which we did not supply), for which we had to prepare and make good after, did not arrive until*December 3rd. We trust the Committee will take this explanation into consideration and instruct the Architect to add the amount referred to to our next certificate. ours obediently, (Signed) FBANK GILES Co. 25 On the 21st January, 1891, the tender of Mr. Marks, of 262, North End Road, for the carrying out of the fittings and furnishing of the Overseers', Accountant's, and New Streets Surveyor's offices, in accordance with the plans and specification prepared by the Architect, for the sum of £179, was accepted, and at the same meeting of the Yestry a flat table, 12 ft. long by 1 ft. 9 in. wide, with seats for six, and a shelf in front for books, was ordered to be provided for representatives of the Press in the Yestry Room, and uniforms for the Hall and Assistant Hallkeeper were decided upon. The Town Hall Committee having had under consideration the question of a covered way, gates, and lamps, to be fixed at the entrance to the Town Hall, invited tenders for the carrying out of the work, and on the 10th December, 1890, the Yestry, on their recommendation, accepted the tender of the St. Pancras Ironworks Company, to provide and fix a covered way, gates, lamps, &c., for the Town Hall entrance, in accordance with the plan prepared by the Architect, for the sum of £159. St. Paul's Schools. On the 26th November, 1890, the following resolution was moved by Dr. Cooney, seconded by Mr. Haines, and carried:— That in furtherance of this Vestry's resolution of 7th September, 1887, the London County Council be memorialised to consider the advisability of taking the necessary steps to obtain a new scheme for the future management of St. Paul's School, after the plan of the scheme recently adopted for Christ's Hospital, so as to permit of popular representation on the governing body according to the strongest recommendation of the Endowed Schools Commissioners to the House of Commons, and afford opportunity for the children of all classes to obtain places by competition on the foundation of that School; also be requested to receive a deputation in support of the memorial; that it be referred to a Special Committee of ten members to draw up the memorial, such Committee to afterwards form the deputation; also, that the Fulham representatives of the Council be requested to introduce the deputation and to further the objects of the Yestry. The following members were then appointed as the Special Committee:— Messrs. Spraggs, Cranfield, Goodacre, Easton, Smyth, Littleboy, Short, Lowndes, and Cornwall and Dr. Cooney, and on the 10th December, 1890, the SubCommittee presented to the Yestry a draft petition, which was approved, and copies sealed and ordered to be forwarded to the London County Council and London School Board; also 200 copies of the petition were ordered to be printed, 140 for members of the London County Council, and 60 for members of the School Board for London. On the 16th December, 1890, a petition presented by Mr. Beal from the Yestry of Fulham, urging an enquiry into the management of St. Paul's Schools, Fulham and Hammersmith, was referred by the London County Council to the Corporate Property Charity and Endowments Committee. Dr. Cooney, on the 11th February, 1891, reported to the Yestry that the deputation, consisting of Messrs. Cranfield, Littleboy, Short, and himself, attended before the Corporate Property Charity and Endowments Committee of the London County Council on Tuesday, 27th January, 1891, re the enquiry into the St. Paul's School, and the Committee, after a patient hearing, requested further printed copies of the petition. 26 On the 18th February, 1891, it was moved by Dr. Cooney, seconded by Mr. Hayes; 1. That a deputation be appointed to wait on the School Board for London, in furtherance of the Vestry's petition sealed on 10th December, 1890, and that the School Board be requested to receive such deputation. 2. That nine members be appointed to form such deputation. 3. That the petitions sent to the London County Council and School Board for London, be entered on the minutes, and a copy be sent to each local authority in London, with a circular letter requesting their co-operation. 4. That a copy of the petition be sent to the Charity Commissioners asking them for their observations and what they intend to do in the matter. Carried. Dr. Cooney, and Messrs. Cornwall, Weatherly, Sayer, Thomas, March, Salmon, Chapman and Warne, were appointed as the deputation. The following is a copy of the petition of the Yestry with reference to St. Paul's School. In the matter of the Foundation called or known as "St. Paul's School," in London, founded by Dean Colet, and in the matter of "The Charitable Trusts Acts, 1853 to 1869,"and" The Endowed Schools Acts, 1869 to 1879." Unto the Chairman and Members of the London County Council. The Humble Petition of the Yestry of the Parish of Fulham in the County of London, Sheweth: 1. That the said St. Paul's School (hereinafter called "the School"), situate in the Parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith, was founded by John Colet, Dean, as a Grammar School, in St. Paul's Churchyard, in A.D. 1508. 2. That the original Statutes of the School, bearing the Founder's autograph, and preserved at the Mercers' Hall, declares the Founder's command to be that "There shal be taught in the Scole children of all nacions and Countres indifferently." 3. The rental of Dean Colet's Estate, as shown by the Court of the Mercers' Company to the Royal Commission, and published in a Blue Book, amounted in 1880 to £12,143 4s. 3½d., also that £1,123 5s. 1d. was in 1880 the income paid to the Governors of the School from Lord Campden's Estate. 4. That since 1883 the School has been removed from St. Paul's Churchyard to its present site. 5. At the present time 600 boys are being educated at the School; the greater part of the pupils reside in the Parish of Fulham, or very near thereto. 6. A scheme was established for the future regulation of the said Foundation, under the "Endowed Schools Acts," on the 24th day of March, 1876, and was varied by the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales, by amended scheme, established on the 4th day of July, 1879. 7. By Clause 10 (1) of the amended scheme, it is provided that the Auditor in each year shall be appointed by the Lord Mayor, and shall receive remuneration subject to the approval of the Charity Commissioners, which shall be paid out of the income of the Foundation ; and that when the Auditor has 27 completed the audit, he shall sign the balance sheet. It appears from the published statement of accounts and balance sheet for the year ending 31st December, 1889, that such balance sheet has not been signed by the Auditor, if there was one, but has been signed by ten Governers instead ; further, no mention is made in the said statement of accounts of any sum paid out of the Foundation as remuneration to any Auditor, thus clearly establishing the fact, that there has been no Auditor appointed, and no audit taken of the accounts, as laid down in the amended scheme. 8. By Clause 14 of the amended scheme, it was provided that the Governing body of the Boys' School should consist of 22 members, of whom one shall be the Master and three the Wardens of the Mercers' Company for the time being, nine shall be appointed by the Court of Assistants of the Company, and the remaining nine shall be appointed as follows:— Three by the Hebdomadal Council of the University of Oxford; three by the Council of the Senate of the University of Cambridge; and three by the Senate of the University of London. By Clause 15, it was provided that Governors of the Girls' School (which has not yet been established) should consist of the said 22 persons, and of four women, to be chosen by them. 9. The Mercers' Company have virtually the whole management of this School, having 13 votes to 9 of the Universities; the members of two Universities, owing to distance, can hardly be expected to attend all General or Special Meetings of the Governing Body or of its Committees; and that of the present 22 members, seven of whom form a quorum, three bear the name of Palmer, and four the name of Watney. The Clerk to the Governors also bears the name of Watney. 10. No provision is made by the said amended scheme for giving to the people of London, in which the School is—or might be—situated, any share in the management, by representation, either direct or indirect; through elected bodies, as the London County Council, the School Board for London, or otherwise. 11. No Girls' School or Schools has or have been yet established as ordered for not less than 400 girls under the provision of Clause 35 (2) of the amended scheme, though the Governing Body are now erecting an enormous Gymnasium, the cost of which could easily have been made to defray the expense of the erection of a Girls' School. 12. By Clause 35 (1) it is ordered to have a School, divided into two Departments, one of which shall be a Classical Department for about 500 boys, and the other a Modern Department for about 500 boys; and, judging from the published statements of accounts, there were but 440 boys who paid tuition fees, and 153 boys on the Foundation, making a total of only about 600 instead of about 1,000 boys; further, the number of boys in each Department of the School cannot be accurately determined, but it is believed that the major part of the boys who pay tuition fees are in the Modern Department, and all—or nearly all—of the 153 boys on the Foundation are in the Classical Department, instead of 77 as ordered by Clause 75 of the amended scheme. 13. Clause 38 of the amended scheme declares that there shall be a Head Master of each Department of St. Paul's School, and that the Head Master of the Classical Department shall be called the High Master. Under Clauses 54 and 55 they have, among other powers, the appointment and removal of all 28 Assistant Teachers; and under Clause 58, the High Master shall receive £300 a year, and the Head Master of the Modern School £200 a year; and that each shall receive from £3 to £6 a year as a capitation payment for less than 300 scholars, and £2 a year when it exceeds that number. The scheme here is set at nought. There is only, as evidenced by the published statement of accounts, one Head Master—that of the Classical Department; he has the power of appointing and removing Assistant Teachers in both the Classical and the Modern Departments; he further receives £300 a year, also a capitation payment of £5 a year for 300 scholars, and £2 a year for 300 scholars, making a total yearly sum of £2,375 6s. 8d., besides a palatial residence. 14. The standard of entrance examination for admission to both the Classical and Modern Departments (Clauses 69 and 71) is a low one, and which, with the exception of the elements of Latin Grammar in the former, and the elements of French Grammar in the latter, should be easily overcome by any boy who has passed the 5th or 6th Standard of Education of the Educational Department, and which is higher than that intended by Dean Colet. But the Governors of St. Paul's School have so raised the minimum standards mentioned in the scheme, that all children from Elementary Schools and MiddleClass Schools are excluded not only from the Foundation, but from the School itself, and it is now simply a School for the boys of the highest classes of society. Instead of the 153 free places on the Foundation being open to all children—especially of the poor, who cannot pay for a liberal education—they are now severally competed for by boys from High-Class Preparatory Schools; the subjects of examination for the free places being English, Latin, Greek, French ancl Mathematics. 15. That the form of the Abstract of Accounts, as ordered in the amended scheme, is not carried out by the Governing Body, since the payments for the Classical and Modern Departments are not shown separately. 16. That 153 boys on the Foundation are educated for £15,114 18s. 8d., while 440 boys are educated for £10,902 2s.; it is therefore contended that 600 boys, and not 153 only, should be educated for £15,114 18s. 8d. 17. That from the published statements of accounts it appears that of an income of £27,233 10s. 5d. , £ s. d. The High Master receives - 2,375 6 8 The Assistant Teachers receive - -- 9,871 11 8 For School Apparatus is expended - 308 2 8 „ Paper, Pens, Ink, etc. - - - - - 136 2 11 „ School Sports ------- 113 7 5 for care of school buildings- For Bepairs is expended - - - - - 920 9 6 „ Servants „ - - - 911 15 0 „ Keeping up Garden is expended - - - 602 8 10 „ Gas, Water, Coal „ - 491 17 9 18. The present constitution of the Governing Body of the School does not inspire confidence in the people of London. The preponderating representation of the Meicers Company is wholly unsatisfactory; and the eminent persons nominated by the Universities have many other avocations which preclude them from giving close and personal attention to the affairs of the School. Your 29 Petitioners invite enquiry as to the average number of attendances by the several Governors at the Meetings of the Governing Body. 19. Your Petitioners would respectfully remind your Council that, on the 18th of May, 1886, the House of Commons resolved:—"That, in the opinion "of this House, every Scheme of the Charity Commissioners ought to provide "for the Majority of the Trustees or Managers being directly elected by the "Ratepayers in the locality to which the Charity extends; "and that the Select Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to enquire into the operation of "The Endowed Schools Act, 1869," and the amending Acts, reported inter alia as follows:—" It is essential to the welfare of Endowed "Schools—not being of a Special character—that the sympathies of the "localities should be enlisted by giving to the people a large share in the "management, by representation, either direct or indirect, through elected "bodies." Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that your Council will be pleased to do all it possibly can to cause the existing scheme, bad as it is, to be carried out, and further to cause, if possible, the said scheme, now in existence over eleven years, to be amended, and which has produced results so adverse to the educational interests of the class for whom it was originally intended, (a) so that this magnificent Foundation, which belongs entirely to the poor, should have its free places assigned to the pupils of Elementary Schools, as have been provided for in the Christ's Hospital Scheme, and (6) by constituting a Governing Body of the said School of a representative character, by admitting the London County Council and the School Board for London to a share in the government and management of the said School, by representation, either direct or indirect, as to your Council may seem fit. And your Petitioners will ever pray, etc. (Signed) JOHN S. SINCLAIB, Chairman. (Signed) Y. J. H.. DENSELOW, Clerk to the Vestry of Fulham. TRAMWAYS SCHEME. On the 10th December, 1890, the Clerk reported to the Yestry the receipt of the Parliamentary plans of the West London Tramways. On the 21st January, 1891, two deputations attended before the Yestry, the first introduced by Mr. Smythe in opposition to the proposed tramway. Mr. Douglas Norman, Solicitor, addressing the Yestry on behalf of the deputation, and presenting a petition signed by 41 out of 44 Frontagers in the Fulham portion of the road; and the second deputation introduced by Mr. Cranfield, for whom Mr. F. W. Ingram acted as spokesman, and presented a petition with 3,000 signatures in favour of the tramway; after the deputations had withdrawn, it 30 was moved by Mr. Weatherley and seconded by Mr. Cranfield—that no objection be made to the laying of tram lines in the Hammersmith Road, but that the matter be referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee to arrange for clauses or safeguards to protect the Vestry's interests; to which an amendment was moved by Mr. Thomas, and seconded by Mr. Margrie, that the word "no" and the words after Hammersmith Road be omitted, On being put to the vote the amendment was declared carried, and put as a substantive motion and carried. CONCLUSION. Appended to this report will be found the Balance Sheets, &c., of the various Charities of the parish, of the Churchwardens and Overseers as regards Precepts, and two reports of the Parish Officers, all of which have been ordered by the Yestry to be printed with this report. I cannot, however, close this report without tendering my best thanks to the whole of the officers in my Department for the able assistance they have rendered me during the past twelve months. \ I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, W.

We especially note that the Vestry Clerk has submitted for examination the Local Management Rate Books for the year ended Lady-Day, 1891, and we have verified therein the amount actually collected, also the amount of arrears outstanding, the allowances to owners for composition, and the amount not recovered through empty property, and each is correctly and clearly stated. We have also examined the Vouchers for the payments made by the Overseers during the same period and have verified the Balances at the Bankers' on March 25th, 1891, and we find the net balance due from the Overseers to be £2,040 3s. 4½d. We observe that the Overseers have drawn separate cheques for each Clerk's weekly salary. We would recommend that instead of pursuing this course in future, a wages book be kept and one cheque for salaries be drawn payable to the Vestry Clerk. This arrangement would save all parties trouble and expense, and be more concise. We desire to state that we are pleased with the very satisfactory manner in which the accounts have been kept, and it is clear to us that the work of balancing the Rates in such a complete manner has entailed a considerable amount of extra labour, for which Mr. Robinson, the Vestry Clerk, is worthy of great credit.

MURIEL FRANK MANBY Trustees, 39 PARISH OF FULHAM, IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON. REPORT of the CHURCHWARDENS AND OVERSEERS, Lady-Day to Christmas, 1890. A. ROBINSON, Vestry Clerk. Overseers' Offices, Town Hall, Walham Green, S.W. 31st January, 1891. 4 ' Parish of Fulham, London. Overseers' Offices, Town Hall, Walham Green, S.W. To the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. Gentlemen, We beg to inform you that we have had under consideration the question of submitting to your Board the details of the business transacted by us in our capacity as Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor, and have unanimously resolved that the same should be furnished to your Vestry. It also occurs to us that no better opportunity than the present time will be likely to arise before the termination of our year of office, bearing in mind the fact that if it were left to a later date the pressure of your business might intercept the attention we are desirous that you will bestow on the subject matter herein contained. It is, therefore, with pleasure that we submit the appended report, containing a synopsis of the business we have transacted during the larger and more important portion of the term of our office. At Lady-day last, the rateable value of the Parish was £403,408, this being the amount upon which the rate made by us on the 3rd May, 1890, was based, whilst the rate in collection made by us and allowed by the Justices on the 31st October last is charged upon a rateable value of £414,654—the increase during the six months intervening has therefore been £11,246. Since the making of the present rates, property to the value of £8,328 has been brought into rating, . showing that since we took office the rateable value has increased in the nine months, to Christmas last, to £19,574, or nearly £20,000, and at a rate of about £25,000 per annum. RATEABLE VALUE. We further anticipate that the rateable value when the next rates are made will be approximately as follows:— Rateable Value as per General Valuation, 1890, coming in force 6th April next, less Government Property £425,707 Increase in the meantime 24,293 £450,000 44 With a view to enable your Vestry to compare the progress of this Parish with others in the Metropolis, we have appended a statement showing the proportional increase upon the rateable value which came in force in April, 1890,. in most of the Metropolitan Parishes north of the River Thames. Proportional Increase in Rateable Value in Eighteen Parishes North of the River Thames. Name of Parish. Rateable Value, 6th April, 1890. Rateable Value, 6th April, 1891. Increase during that period.

With reference to the work in connection with the General Valuation, at the commencement of our term of office, a most important question was under consideration, viz.: that of providing professional assistance, upon which we were advised that it was absolutely our duty to prepare the valuation list as a whole, and that, in the absence of the necessary consent of the Assessment Committee, the existing Valuation revised to date as previously determined by the Assessment Committee, might be sent in, and would be considered a fulfilment of the duties cast upon us, but we were desirous that the Valuation should be thoroughly revised, and consequently reconsidered the matter, finally deciding to engage the services of Mr. J. G. Hall, for the valuation of all ordinary Properties, Public Houses, &c., at a fixed remuneration of £310, being exactly the same sum as was paid to him in the Quinquennial Valuation of the year 1885, or equivalent to 1s. 3d. per cent. upon the Rateable Value of the Parish. Messrs. Hedley & Co. were retained by the Assessment Committee to re-value the properties of Public Companies, at a remuneration of 7s. 6d. per cent. With regard to the result of the General Valuation, 1890, we think we cannot do better than append the following statement forwarded to us on 18th December last:— FULHAM UNION ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE.

Alpin Marsh, Clerk. 49 Upon reverting to the statement showing the increase in the Gross and Rateable Values during each year (under the title of Rateable Value), it will be observed that the increase resulting from the Quinquennial Valuation of 1885 was of similar amount to that realised on this occasion; but upon analysis (as given hereunder) By the same statement it will also be observed that the increases per annum for the two periods 1880-85, and 1885-90, were not of like proportions, the increases for the former period being far in excess of those during the last five years. This we think is due to some extent to the fact that during the earlier period, the building operations were progressing on the Cedars, Barons Court, and Salisbury Estates, at a rapid rate, whilst latterly they have been somewhat suspended. We, however, find that during the past twelve months, several new Estates have been thrown open for building, and we anticipate that shortly a similar increase to that during the period 1880-5, is probable. This is supported by the statement of the number of new houses brought into rating, given under the heading of Ordinary Valuation. Therefore we are of opinion that this portion of the work, which entailed a considerable amount of extra labour, would seem to show a fair result. ORDINARY VALUATION. In the conduct of this business we have deemed it advisable to continue the periodical engagement of the services of Mr. J. G. Hall, with the sanction from time to time of the Assessment Committee, at a remuneration of 6s. 8d. per cent. on the value sustained on new and increased property, and 3s. 4d. per cent. on the value of prooperty reduced by the Assessment Committee. During the last nine months we have received 247 applications from Ratepayers, for the reduction of their Assessments, and have forwarded five Provisional Lists to the Assessment Committee at periods of about six weeks. Beyond the cases of Appeal included in these Lists, 743 new properties have been brought into rating. REGISTRATION BOROUGH. The subject of the fees paid to our predecessors for attendance at the Borough Revision Court was in abeyance at the time of our appointment, and upon an it will be seen that the more recent result is an advance on the former figures so far as we are concerned, for the reason that the increase on the ordinary properties is greater:— £ s. d. In 1885 the increase consisted of 41,756 0 0 Deduct increase on properties of Public Companies 17,305 0 0 Increase per ordinary Properties 24,451 0 0 £ s. d. In 1890 the increase consisted of 41,144 0 0 Deduct increase on properties of Public Companies 11,487 0 0 Increase per ordinary Properties 29,657 0 0 50 authoritative opinion having been obtained, and our predecessors having declined to accept any remuneration, it was decided that they should not be paid. The numbers of claims, &c., received in July and August last were as follows: Householders' Claims, Division I., Parliamentary and Municipal 1575 Do. do. Parliamentary only, Division II 34 Do. do Municipal only, Division III 306 New Lodgers' Claims, Parliamentary only 702 Old Lodgers' Claims, do. do 688 Objections, Householders, Division I 913 Do. do. do. II 6 Do. do. do. III 13 Lodger Objections 96 Although we believe that these figures (that is the Parliamentary Claims) will compare favourably with those of the preceding year, we might state that owing to our firm action, there has been a marked improvement in the number of returns by the Owners, for the purpose of filling the Occupiers' column in the Rate, but we have nevertheless determined that the inconvenience which has for a long time past been caused by the owners of compound property neglecting to furnish their tenants' names, as required under Sec. 9 of the 32 and 33 vic., Cap. 41, shall be diminished, and as a preliminary precaution the vestry Clerk sent by our instruction in November last, a circular letter threatening proceedings. The result was that about 50 of the forms sent out in the preceding July were returned, so that in each of those cases the persons admitted their negligence by that act. We, however, intend to insure the service of the next issue of these forms, so that without further notice summonses may be taken out. CHAIRMANSHIP AND NUMBER OF MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCES. The number of Meetings convened since our election is thirty-one, at which— Dr. J. Edwin Cooney attended 18 times Churchwardens. Mr. Frank Manby „ 11 „ „ Arthur Williams „ 28 „ Overseers. „ Richard E. Cranfield „ 26 „ „ Thomas Goodacre „ 26 „ With regard to the Chairmanship we are advised that there is no light of precedence in this matter, and we decided that the same should be filled by rotation. Our rule has been to meet fortnightly, beyond which our attendance is required at Petty Sessions for hearing Rate Summonses and applications for Committal Orders on four occasions during the year, also four or five days at the Boro' Revision Court, at County Revision Court at Westminster, and at Special Sessions at Kensington for the revision of the Jury List, also at Poor Law Audit upon two occasions during the year. At Assessment Committee 51 Meetings on about twenty occasions. At Meetings of the Trustees of United Charities, about four in number. At Meetings of the Trustees of the Waste Land and Lygon's Almshouses, about four in number. At Meetings of Trustees of Sir William Powell's Charity, about four in number, and the Churchwardens alcne at Meetings of Trustees Bishop King and Dr. Edward's Charity. We think it should be noted in fairness to the Churchwardens that Mr. Manby was absent through illness from the 24th April to 29th May, during a period of seven meetings, and Dr. Cooney was absent through the same cause from 29th April to 30th June, during a period of eight meetings. Mr. Goodacre was away from town on his summer vacation during the month of July whilst three meetings were held. PARLIAMENTARY ELECTORS. With reference to the number of Parliamentary Electors for this Borough, we beg to submit the following statement, showing the numbers in each vear since 18G9. There appears to have been a fluctuation in the same between the years 1876 and 1881, but since then the growth has not only been rapid, but of somewhat fairer proportions. Year. Numbers of Parliamentary Electors. Year, Number of Parliamentary Electors. 1869 822 1881 3104 1870 1307 1882 No Register in Office. 1871 1714 1883 4102 1872 2236 1884 4567 1873 No Register in Office. 1885 5214 1874 2576 1886 6500 1875 2639 1887 7373 1876 2922 1888 7906 1877 3115 1889 8109 1878 2995 1890 8698 1879 3207 1591 9135 1880 3175 - - MUNICIPAL ELECTORS. The number of Electors registered under the County Electors Act, 1888, are as follows:— 1890 8629. 1891 9536. ESTIMATES. Our estimates for rates have been submitted to each member of your Board from time to time, and have been calculated upon a closer basis than formerly, our object being to charge the Ratepayers for the time being their fair proportion only of current expenses. We recognise the unfairness which might arise to persons entering the Parish at a time when there was a 52 deficiency of £1,000 or thereabout, which would in reality necessitate their subscribing about 1d. in the £ to the expenses of the previous half-year. In order that your Vestry might have better opportunity of judging the fairness of our estimate, we directed that the Vestry Clerk's report should accompany our last estimate ; no explanations of this character have, we believe, been afforded the members of your Vestry before. COLLECTION OF RATES. The collection of the rates, we have reason to believe, has been carried out luring the last half-year in a more expeditious manner than formerly, judging by the amount of arrears outstanding on the Poor Rate at the end of each halfyear, which we give hereunder:— £ s. d. Arrears at 29th September, 1888, when the rate in the £ was 1/1 436 17 4 „ 25th March, 1889, „ „ „ 1/2 620 18 6 „ 29th September, 1889, „ „ „ 1/8 1670 15 7 ,, 25th March, 1890, „ „ „ 1/5 1415 2 7 „ 29th September, 1890, „ „ „ 1/6 398 11 1 We think it only fair to state that the Assistant Auditor of the Local Government Board, on the 6th January instant, expressed his opinion "that our accounts were in a very satisfactory state," and our balance sheet—copy of which is appended hereto—was certified by him as correct. We have also tested the percentage of loss during the last half-year as compared with the same of preceding half-years, with the following results:— Half-year ended September, 1888, loss = 17¾ per cent. „ „ March, 1889, „ = 17 9/10 „ „ September, 1889 „ = 16 9/10 „ „ „ March, 1890 „ = 16 9/10 „ „ „ September, 1890 „ = 15 9/10 „ It would, therefore, seem that our assertion that the rates have been collected with more speed during our term of office, is supported by the foregoing comparisons.

In October last we had under discussion the advisability of revising the form of particulars of expenditure at the back of the Demand Note, with a view to affording the ratepayers a more explicit idea of the purposes for which the rates were levied; the result was that we decided to adopt the form at present in use, which we hope may be considered an improvement upon the meagre statement previously given. FINANCE. With reference to our financial position, if you will be good enough to revert to our observations on the collection, it is there shewn that the percentage of loss has decreased from nearly 17 per cent. in the year ended Lady-day, 1890, to 15 per cent.; we have consequently the corresponding net increase in the collection. We think it only fair to submit that whilst the expenses tor the maintenance of the Parish and the Relief of the Poor, together with the contributions of the Central Authorities, continue to increase in the proportion they recently have, it prevents our levying the rates on a lower scale which we should in the interests of the ratepayers desire to effect. £ s. d. The Precepts of the Guardians for the half-year ended Lady-day, 1890, amounted to 17,641 0 0 The Precepts of the Guardians for the half-year ended 29th September, 1890 22,639 0 0 £40,280 0 0 The whole of the first mentioned was met by our predecessors by the 22nd February, 1890, and the same with the second half-year by the 25th September, 1890. £ s. d. The Precepts of the Guardians for the half-year to Lady-day, 1891, amount to 21,338 0 0 £10,700, being the instalment for the quarter to Christmas, has now been paid, whilst the like instalment last year was not completed until the 21st January, 1890. With reference to the Precepts of your Vestry we find that:— £ s. d. For the half-year ended 25tli March, 1890, the amount required was 26,509 9 0 And the like for the following half-year ended September, 1890 26,561 8 6 - £53,070 17 6 The whole of the first mentioned amount had been paid to your credit by the 17th March, 1890, whilst with regard to the second amount the whole had been settled by the 19th September last. 55 The amount required by you for the half-year to Lady-day, 1891, is £29,879 13s. 2d., which is, as you are aware, considerably in excess of your charges on our predecessors. We have nevertheless paid £15,000 of this amount, whilst on the llth January, 1890, our predecessors had paid for the corresponding period £ £11,280 9s. 6d. We think therefore that due regard has been observed for the financial requirements of your Vestry and the Guardians of the Poor respectively. With regard to our other expenditure we have the pleasure to state that there has been a considerable reduction in several cases. Borough Revision Expenses— £ s. d. were in 1889 291 8 2 and in 1890 196 9 10 County Registration Expenses— £ s. d. were in 1888 20 15 0 1889 10 1 3 1890 7 1.5 9 The Salary of the Vestry Clerk and Assistant Overseer was formerly .£530, the present salary being ,£250.

Our Total Expenditure during the half-year on account of the Poor Rate amounted to £28,515 12s. 7d., and consisted of the following disbursements:— £ s. d. Guardians 22,639 0 0 Police 4,014 13 1 Library Commissioners 802 18 7 Salary of Vestry Clerk 125 0 0 Returning Officer's expenses 115 13 0 Borough Registration, 1889, extra duties 24 3 0 County Registration expenses 7 15 9 Churchyard expenses 53 9 8 Ordinary Valuation expenses 50 0 7 Printing and Stationery 58 6 3 Jury List 26 5 6 Vestry election 40 5 6 Office expenses, comprising:—Rent, Rates and Taxes 122 17 5 Claim for Dilapidations 165 15 0 Balance Quinquennial Valuation 243 10 10 Receipt Stamps 15 15 8 Petty Cash and Postage 10 2 9 £28,515 12 7 56 Our Total Expenditure during the same period on account of the Local Bates, amounted to £27,262 18s. 2d., and consisted of the following disbursements:— £ s. d.

The lease of the late Vestry Offices dated from the 10th August, 1869, at .£75 per annum, having expired in September, 1889, it was necessary to continue the tenancy for one year to the 29th September, 1890, for which our predecessors were unable to negotiate a lower sum than £110, which your Vestry were good enough to approve, and which the Local Government Board sanctioned by Order dated 13th June, 1890. Our predecessors having previous to the 25th March, 1890, given notice to quit the old Offices at the 29th September, 1890, it became necessary to negotiate with your Vestry for accommodation in the New Town Hall, upon which your Vestry resolved that the sum of £150 should be charged for the Office set apart for our use. We are pleased, however, to state that your Vestry were good enough to modify your terms. The negotiations in regard to the dilapidations to which we became liable were in the meantime pending, and we deemed it expedient to engage the assistance of Mr. George Edwards, Architect, who, after an inspection of the premises, with the Landlord's Surveyor, succeeded in obtaining a settlement for the payment of £150, and Surveyor's fees £15 15s. 0d., to release us from the liability to make good the old premises under the covenants of the old lease. We are obliged to your Vestry for the consideration it has bestowed in affording us the required accommodation in the New Town Hall, and are awaiting your pleasure in the matter of the completion of the agreement, and in order that we may make the necessary application to the Local Government Board for its approval, we shall be glad to determine the same at an early date. 57 SUMMONS AND WARRANT ACCOUNT. With regard to this subject we believe a balance sheet was furnished to your Vestry to Lady-day last, showing a balance in hand of £72 18s. 6½d. We give below a brief account of the last half-year's receipts, &c.:— £ s. d. £ s. d. To Balance 72 18 6½ By transfer to Overseers' „ Receipts 167 5 3 Local Rate Account „ Expenditure, including Collectors' old Postage 70 0 0 Account on Poor Rate 94 0 111 Balance at Bank 76 2 10 £240 3 9½ £240 3 9½ £50 of the balance in hand at the 29th September last was transferred to the Local Rates Account on the 10th October last. All sums received on this Account are now paid, by our direction, by the Collectors into a distinct Account at the Bankers' under this head, and all disbursements are paid by us per cheque. We have, therefore, reason to think that the Account is now kept upon a more satisfactory basis than it was formerly. RESIDUE OF THE SALE PRODUCE OF THE TOWN HALL SITE, £425. In April last we received a copy of a resolution of your Vestry, requesting us to apply to the Local Government Board with a view to obtain the residue of the sale produce of the Town Hall site, so that the same might be applied in aid of the cost of erection of the Town Hall, and we thereupon instructed the Vestry Clerk to carry your wishes into effect, although a previous application had been made on the 28th March, 1888, by our predecessors without effect. We have, however, succeeded in obtaining from the Local Government Board an Order, dated 13th December last, directing the Guardians to pay to us the sum referred to. The Guardians have, in compliance with that Order, paid to us the sum of £425, which we have also paid to your Treasurer on the 9th January instant. Finally, in presenting this, the first report of its kind from your Parish Officers, we hope to have given you every information in our power, and established a precedent which may well be followed by all our successors in office. We also beg to cordially recognise the constant and valuable attention and assistance of Mr. A. Robinson, the Vestry Clerk, who has done his duty to our perfect satisfaction. We are, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, (Signed) J. EDWIN COONEY (Chairman), Churchwarden. THOMAS GOODACRE, R. E. CRANFIELD, ARTHUR WILLIAMS, Overseers. January 13 th, 1891. PARISH OF FULHAM, IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT of the CHURCHWARDENS AND OVERSEERS, Christmas to Lady Day, 1891. A. ROBINSON, Vestry Clerk. Overseers' Offices, Town Hall, Walham Grein, S.W. 4 25th March, 1891. Parish of Fulham, London. Overseers' Offices, Town Hall, Walham Green, S.W. March, 1891. To the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. Gentlemen, With a view to complete the record of our business for our term of office as Churchwardens and Overseers, we have the pleasure to transmit herewith a Supplementary Report dealing with the period from Christmas last to the 25th March instant. RATEABLE VALUE. By our previous report it is shown that 743 new properties (representing a rateable value of £19,574) had been assessed between Lady Day 1890, and Christmas last; 133 new properties have since been brought into rating, representing a rateable value of £3,050, thus making a total for the twelve months of 876 new properties, amounting to £22,624. Therefore, taking the new valuation as the basis, the rateable value may now be estimated at £448,331. Ninety applications for reduction of assessment have been received from ratepayers since our last record, thereby making 337 appeals in the year. QUINQUENNIAL VALUATION. At the time our last report was submitted, the appeals to Quarter Sessions were pending, the only case with which we have proceeded being that of Mr. Nalder, of Mornington Lodge, West Kensington, for which your Vestry's sanction was requested and unanimously given. It will be remembered that in this case the respondent was dissatisfied with the decision of the Assessment Committee of the Fulham Union, and appealed to the Justices of the Kensington Division in Special Sessions, the result being that the assessments were reduced from gross value £360, rateable value £300, to gross value £300, rateable value £250. This case was heard by Sir Peter Edlin, Q.C., Arc., Chairman of the London County Sessions, on Thursday, March 5th, when his Lordship affirmed the reduction made by the Special Sessions. The view his Lordship took of the case was to the effect that, although the Overseers had not fixed exorbitant values upon the premises, yet the same were excessive and ascertained from a wrong basis. He remarked that the Justices of the Kensington Division had adjourned the case from the 2nd to the 9th December, and had in the meantime viewed the premises. He had no reason to suppose they were incompetent to form an opinion as to the value of the premises, but on the contrary he had reason to think they were specially able to express an accurate opinion, and 62 that opinion was expressed as being unanimous. He did not contend that the figures would not seem to justify the higher assessment, but the question for the Court to decide was what the house would be expected to let for per annum, the tenant paying outgoings, and it appeared to him from the evidence that £300 was a reasonable rent. It had not been proved to him that the premises were worth more than this sum to an annual tenant, taking the locality and the present circumstances into consideration. There were many circumstances which might induce a person to pay a higher price for a house of this character, but the question to be decided was what the house would let for to an annual tenant, and the bench were unanimously of opinion that they could not expect these premises to let for more than £300. The ruling of the Special Sessions was therefore affirmed. In order that our position in this matter may be fairly understood, we think it advisable to append the following extracts from correspondence we received from the Clerk to the Assessment Committee on the subject, by which it will be shown that we were urged to adopt the course we followed. "19th December, 1890. "The Committee have no doubt whatever, that the decision which has "been come to by the Justices, is entirely opposed to the general principles of "Valuation which are carried out in this Union, and in other parts of the "Metropolis, and therefore they are unanimously of opinion that steps "should be at once taken by appeal to Quarter Sessions to reverse such " decision." "6th January, 1891. "I am directed by the Assessment Committee of this Union to forward "you copy of a case which they have had submitted to Counsel, together " with copy of his opinion, in the matter of the appeal of Mr. H. F. Nalder, "to the Special Sessions against the Fulham Valuation List. "It will be observed that Mr. Alexander Glen is of opinion that the "Assessment Committee, except in regard to totals, would have no locus "standi before the Quarter Sessions, but there can be no doubt as to the "power of the Overseers to appeal to Quarter Sessions in defence of their " Valuation List. "The Committee therefore direct me to urge upon them the great "importance of fully considering the matter, and the principle which is "involved in a case of this kind." COPY OF COUNSEL'S OPINION. Nalder v. Assessment Committee of the Fulham Union. Case to advise. The Assessment Committee of the Union of Fulham were respondents in an appeal to Special Sessions against the decision confirming the Overseer's Estimate of the gross and rateable values of certain hereditaments in the occupation of H. F. Nalder. The Justices, after hearing the case, decided to reduce the gross and rateable values to sums which the Assessment Committee consider do not fairly represent the values of the hereditaments in question, and the Assessment Committee are of opinion that there is sufficient evidence to support their own figures in the event of an appeal. However, by Sec. 32 of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, the persons entitled to appeal to Quarter Sessions 63 against any decision of Special Sessions, would appear to be "Ratepayers," "Surveyors of Taxes," and "Overseers," and there is no express provision in that Act, or in the Acts incorporated therewith, expressly enabling an Assessment Committee to appeal against such a decision. Upon the assumption that in the absence of express enactments they were precluded from appealing, the Assessment Committee of the Fulham Union applied to the Overseers of the Parish in which Mr. Nalder's property is situate, requesting them to prosecute the appeal, but although the Overseers have not expressly refused to do so, they have intimated a wish that the request should not be urged upon them, but that Counsel's opinion should be asked for upon the point before any further steps are taken. In the case of Darlington Union Assessment Committee v. Chapman, 44 J.P. 237, Q.S., it was held that as the Statute 6 and 7 William 4th, cap. 96, contained no provision allowing the Assessment Committee to appeal to Quarter Sessions, if they impugn the decision of the Special Sessions they were not entitled to appeal. But in a more recent case of Regina v. Montgomeryshire Justices, 50 L.J.M.C. 52, 44, L.T. 310, 45, J.P. 407, it was held that the Assessment Committee of Llanidloes and Newtown Union had the right to appeal under 6 & 7 William the 4th, and 27 & 28 Vic., cap. 39, Sec. 2, against the decision of the Justices in Special Sessions, to the next General Quarter Sessions in the name of the Guardians, and the Court based its decision upon the ground that the right of appeal by an Assessment Committee, was one of the incidents of other appeals within the meaning of 27 & 28 Vic., cap. 39, Sec. 2. By section 1 of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, the Act of 27 & 28 Vic., cap. 39, is, so far as is consistent with the tenor of the Act of 1869, incorporated with it, and the 2nd section above referred to is not repealed by the 5th Schedule of the Act, 1869. The question therefore appears to be whether (assuming that according to the decision of Regina v. Montgomeryshire Justices, the right of appeal to Quarter Sessions against the decision of Justices in Special Sessions, is one of the "incidents" of the right of resisting an appeal to Special Sessions conferred upon the Assessment Committee by Sec. 2 of 27 & 28 Vic., cap. 39, in so far as Assessments outside the Metropolitan area are concerned), there is anything in that section which is inconsistent with the tenor of the Act of 1869. In the event of Counsel being of opinion that the Assessment Committee of the Fulham Union have not a locus standi, Counsel will please advise:-— Whether they can join pro forma some Ratepayer within the Parish in which Nalder's property is situate, and whether in the event of their doing so and of an adverse decision, they will be entitled to pay any expenses incurred by, or awarded against them out of the Common Fund, and upon the case generally. Opinion. I am of opinion that the Assessment Committee could only appeal to the Quarter Sessions, in connection with the Valuation of Mr. Nalder's property, under the latter parts of sections 20 & 32 of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, on the ground that, having regard to the decision of the Special Sessions, the totals of the gross and rateable values of the Parish are now too high. Section 2 of the Union Assessment Committee Amendment Act, 1864, which authorised an Assessment Committee to appear as respondents in an appeal, in the name, and with the consent of the Guardians, and with the like 64 incidents as in the case of persons other than the Overseers who receivenotice of appeal, has reference only to appeals against poor rates, (which may be brought in the Metropolis on grounds other than those relating to the Valuation of the property): and in the present case the Assessment Committeewere respondents in the appeal at the Special Sessions, not by virtue of that section, but by virtue of section 33 of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. There is in my opinion nothing in the latter Act to give the Assessment Committee expressly, or by implication, a right of appeal to the London Quarter Sessions, sitting as Assessment Sessions under that Act, against the decision of the Special Sessions reducing the Valuation of Mr. Nalder's property. Any ratepayer may appeal to the Quarter Sessions against the decision of the Special Sessions, and so may the Overseers of the Parish with the consent of the Vestry; but the Assessment Committee would not in my opinion have any locus standi on such an appeal, and would have no power to charge any costs which they might incur on the Common Fund of the Union ; though if they were to appear as appellants and no objection to their appearance were made, and if an order to pay costs were made against them under Sec. 39 of the Act of 1869, and such order were not quashed upon certiorari or otherwise, I do notthink that the Auditor could subsequently go behind the order of the Court and disallow the payment made in pursuance of it.

The particulars of expenditure which formed the basis of Valuation in this, case, were admitted by Counsel for the Respondent to be as follows:— Amount of Purchase money £5,000 0 0 Amount expended in improvements since purchase 2,500 0 0 Ground Rent 45 0 0 ORDINARY VALUATION. With reference to this subject we had reason to believe that the method hitherto adopted in arriving at the gross values was not entirely satisfactory, and consequently, on the 24th February last, we had the subject under consideration. It appeared to us that the intention of the Statute 32 and 33 Vic., cap. 67, had not been adhered to in the past, in so far that the amount at which premises might be expected to let to an annual tenant (paying the usual rates and taxes) should be the gross value ; but the practice had been to take the exact figures in every case of the amount of rent paid. We were advised that this course was not in accordance with the ruling of Lord Denman, and consequently Resolved— "That the Vestry Clerk be and he is hereby instructed to grant an "appeal to any ratepayer whom he has reason to believe is not rated upon "the principle set forth in the Statute, viz.:— 'What the house might be "expected to let for per annum, tenant's rates and taxes and tithe's com"mutation excepted,' and in future to oppose at Assessment Committee "meetings, the rent being taken as conclusive evidence, where he has reason "to believe the rent is untrustworthy evidence, and does not represent the " gross value of property." 65 With regard to the principle previously followed in dealing with the requisitions of ratepayers, the lists were prepared containing entries of appeals received from time to time, but the old or rather the existing valuation was repeated in the column headed "gross value as estimated by Overseers," so that the matter was left entirely to the discretion of the Assessment Committee—this necessitated in every case the strict compliance by the appellants with the formalities set forth in the Valuation Metropolis Act, 1869. We could not help recognising the trouble to which the appellants were thus subjected—in many instances a day's pay would be lost; in many others, important engagements had to be set aside; and in all cases it required attendance and waiting until the case was called on by the Committee. After consideration we decided that a great deal of this trouble might be obviated where similarity in the character of property existed and the evidence in our possession was clear'. We were therefore of the opinion that we were not justified in placing figures in the column referred to, which upon examination appeared unjust and excessive ; but by using our discretion, as it seemed was implied by the words in the heading of the column in the form given in the schedule of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, we hoped to save the ratepayers in many cases the trouble and inconvenience caused by the former plan. In dealing with the last Provisional List, we examined the circumstances connected with each case, and satisfied ourselves that the new values were reasonably fixed. It will be observed upon reference to the case of Mr. Nalder (mentioned under the title of "Quinquennial Valuation"), that it has since been proved by the ruling of Sir Peter Edlin, Q.C., that our new course' is the correct one. BOROUGH REGISTRATION. In order to insure the more efficient registration of Voters for this Borough, we have instructed the Vestry Clerk to apply for summonses against those owners who neglect to furnish the names of their tenants under 32 and 33 Vict, cap. 41, sec. 9, but although this plan may effect an improvement in the Franchise, it seemed to us that the registration work might be more effectually carried out by personal enquiry from house to house. At the same time we observed that the money expended for outside labour, i.e.—service of summonses, service of commitment notices, publication of notices of Vestry election and the result thereof on Church doors, also notices of Poor Rate audit and of New Rates twice in each year, and the several notices under the Valuation Metropolis Act, 1869, together with other business which might be performed by the same person, was about equivalent to what a messenger might be engaged for, and consequently came to the conclusion that there would be a considerable advantage in having such a person generally in readiness. We accordingly appointed a messenger and clerk at a weekly salary of 30s. such salary to be charged on the Summons Account, to perform the following duties, viz.: — 1. To attend at the offices of the Churchwardens and Overseers during the usual business hours, and at such other times as may be necessary. 2. Twice during the year to call at every house or tenement in the parish, and ascertain the correct names of the occupiers, together with the exact date of commencement of occupation, or if the occupation has commenced since the 15th July last, all intermediate residences and the date of occupation in eaoh case, and any other particulars necessary for the proper registration of voters which the Vestry Clerk may deem advisable. 66 3. To ascertain the trade or calling of all persons liable to serve on Juries. 4. To serve all summonses for Poor and Local Management Rates, and to keep a proper register of the service of same. 5. To serve all notices of applications for commitment warrants, keeping a proper register of the service of same, and to ascertain the whereabouts of defaulters. 6. To attend at Petty Sessions in each case and prove service on oath. 7. To attend to the proper publication of the following public notices, viz.:— Notices of Vestry election and result of same. „ New Rates (twice annually). „ Poor Rate audit (twice annually). „ Valuation Lists, on deposit. „ Objections. „ Re-deposit of Valuation List. „ Special Sessions. „ Quarter Sessions. „ County Registration and the various Lists connected therewith. „ Borough Registration and the various Lists connected therewith. 8. To assist with the clerical work of the office when not otherwise engaged, and generally to carry out the instructions of the Vestry Clerk. We think our successors might enhance the opportunity of securing the required information by adding a note at the back of the rate demand paper, requesting the occupiers to afford them every assistance with a view to arrive at a successful issue and avoid dispute. NUMBER OF MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCES. The number of meetings convened since our previous report is six, making, with the thirty-one meetings therein mentioned, a total of thirty-seven meetings for the vear.

On the twenty-fifth day of February, we forwarded to your Vestry copy of an order recently issued by the Local Government Board upon this subject, which in effect has abolished the necessity that formerly existed for the appointment of an Assistant Overseer, to carry out the duties to be transacted in our offices in connection with the Local Management rates; and has incorporated the same with the duties to be performed by the Vestry Clerk, in accordance with the conditions defined on his appointment in March, 1890. OFFICE ACCOMMODATION. Since our last report, the negotiations in this matter have been concluded, and the sealed agreement of your Vestry has been handed to us, whilst we have also handed an attested counterpart to your Clerk. We append hereto copy of the Letter and Order of the Local Government Board approving our action. E 8887 1891 Copy of Letter from Local Government Board. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 2nd March, 1891. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th January, and to forward to you copies of an Order which they have issued under section 1 of the Act 24 and 25 Vic., cap 125, signifying their consent to the Overseers of the Poor of the Parish of Fulham hiring from the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, three rooms in the Town Hall, Walham Green, to be used as offices for the transaction of the business of the Parish. The Board approve of the proposal that the Overseers should hire the rooms referred to, from year to year, at an annual rent of One Hundred and Twenty Pounds. The draft agreement forwarded with your letter is returned herewith. When the agreement is executed the Board request to be informed of its date. I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, (Signed), S. B. PROVIS, Assistant Secretary. To Arthur Robinson, Esq., Vestry Clerk of the Parish of Fulham, Town Hall, Walham Green, S.W. 68 V Copy of Local Government Board Order. 26,711. 25th February, 1891. Parochial Office—Fulham Union, Parish of Fulham. To the Overseers of the Poor of the Parish of Fulham, in the County of London:— And to all others whom it may concern. Whereas under the authority of Orders issued by the Poor Law Board and the Local Government Board, and dated respectively the 25th day of July, 1868, and the 13th day of June, 1890, the Overseers of the Poor of the said Parish of Fulham hired, for periods which have now expired, certain premises known as Berwick House, Walham Green, for the purpose of an office for the transaction of the business of the said parish. And whereas it is deemed expedient that in lieu of the said premises, certain other premises should be hired for the purpose above-referred to, and the Vestry of the said parish have agreed to let the said Overseers for such purpose, three rooms in the building known as the Town Hall, Walham Green. And whereas the Overseers of the Poor of the said parish have made application in writing to us, the Local Government Board, for our sanction to their entering into an agreement with the said "Vestry for the hire of the rooms above-referred to. Now therefore in pursuance of the powers given to us by the Statute passed in the 25th year of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, intituled "An Act to enable Overseers in populous parishes to provide " offices for the proper discharge of parochial business," and the several other Statutes in that behalf, we, by this Order, under our Seal, signify our consent to the hiring by the Overseers of the Poor of the said parish of the rooms above-referred to, from the said Vestry, for such period, and at such rent, as shall from time to time be approved by us, such rooms to be appropriated for the purpose of Offices for the transaction of the business of the said parish.

We are pleased to note the satisfactory manner in which the work of our Offices has been executed by our staff, although during the past six months the same has been performed under difficulties, owing to the unfinished condition of the offices ; and we are also pleased to observe that the furnishing is now being proceeded with. FINANCE. "When we state that it has devolved upon us to levy the sum of £126,135 13s. 11d. in rates during our period of office, for the purpose of supplying the requirements of the Guardians of this Parish, the Police Authorities and those of your Vestry, the importance and responsibility of our office will be apparent. The balances handed over bv our predecessors at Lady-day, 1890, were as stated hereunder. £ s. d. Poor Pate 1,216 7 4½ Local Pates 1,698 11 8 - £2,914 19 0½ After taking these balances into account a further sum of £110,817 3s. 7½d. has been expended since Lady-day last, and we find ourselves with the following balances in hand at the termination of our office. £ s. d.

Owing to previous negligence, together with the serious hindrance caused by the Local Government Board enquiry, the work had fallen into a disastrous state of arrear. In addition to this the business was transferred to the New Town Hall at a period when the staff 72 was working under great pressure, as well as the inconvenience caused by unfurnished offices It therefore seems to us that ours has been a somewhat eventful period—but at the same time, considering all the circumstances, a highly satisfactory one To briefly summarise: the Rates have been made at earlier dates for the last two half-years than formerly The ordinary Valuation work has during the last year been more closely watched, and the heavy task of re-valuing the whole parish has been accomplished Our attention has also been directed to the prosecution of brothel-keepers, and we considered the matter very fully, deciding to proceed in one case for which Solicitor was instructed; the occupier, however, shortly afterwards left the premises, which are now empty It will of course be understood that in prosecuting these proceedings, it is necessary that all action should be kept secret, if any success is expected, or the occupier would easily defeat the action,—we consequently did not mention this subject in our last report We think that we have at any rate established a new principle in reporting for the first time the particulars of the work of our offices, which is likely to prove a useful guide to our successors; and, if the practice is adhered to, a substantial record will in time result therefrom We again cordially recognise the constant and valuable services rendered by Mr A Robinson, Vestry Clerk, who has tried to do his duty to our perfect satisfaction, and we strongly recommend our successors to consider the advisability of recommending the Vestry to give Mr Robinson a substantial increase to his present salary (Signed) Thomas Goodacre, Overseer,

District Board of Works, so that the net increase for the five years amounts to £36,704 6s 8d , out of which the Town Hall, stables, wharf, and other properties, together with miles of wood paving and numerous improvements, have been provided PROPERTY ACCOUNT During the past year the Vestry obtained a Loan of £2,500 from the London County Council, for the construction of a river wall, etc , at the Old Toll House Wharf On August the 7th, 1889, the Vestry accepted the tender of Messrs R Mayo and Co , Limited, for the construction of the wharf at the sum of £1,850 (afterwards increased to £1,900, on account of delay, etc ) The works have just been finished, and the contractors paid £1,800 on account of same In November, 1888, the Vestry accepted the tender of Mr R Cox, for the erection of a Public Mortuary and Coroner's Court at the sum of £975 This work has been completed and the mortuary is in public use; the total cost of same amounts to £1,023 l1s 7d , exclusive of furnishing TOWN HALL FUND During the year 1890-91 one quarter's interest on the £1,084 9s 10d , 2f per cent. annuities, mentioned in my last year's report, has been invested in the purchase of additional stock amounting to £7 5s 10d , increasing the total amount of stock held by the Trustees (the Rev F H Fisher and Messrs Lammin and King) to £1,091 15s 8d This stock they lately sold out producing, together with a quarter's interest due, £1,057 3s 9d , which has been placed to the credit of this account The Vestry obtained a loan of £13,400 from the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1888-9 towards the cost of erecting the Town Hall and Offices in the Fulham Road The builder has finished his work and been paid £23,000, while the architect has drawn £1,000 on account of his fees During 1890-91 the London County Council granted a loan of £2,800 for 30 years towards the cost of the freehold site of the Town Hall, while the Fulham Guardians returned to the Vestry the sum of £425, being the surplus they had in hand in connection with the purchase of same On the 30th April, 1890, the Vestry entered into a contract with Messrs Giles and Co , of Kensington, to fit up and furnish the Town Hall and Offices at the sum of £2,454 Of this sum £400 had been paid at date, in addit on to £93 3s 7d paid to other persons for clocks and chairs Towards the cost of furnishing, the London County Council have granted a loan of £1,600 for ten years IMPROVEMENT ACCOUNT As stated in a previous Report, this Account was opened with a view of providing for small items of a permanent nature, instead of carrying them to a 79 Loan Schedule Account to be charged to future Rates It will be seen by the Abstract of the Account, that the Receipts have been large, and the Payments small during the past year, leaving a substantial balance to carry forward LOAN SCHEDULE During the past year, no schedule of works for a loan has been prepared, and consequently no application made to the London County Council, but on a previous schedule of sewer works for a loan of £1,855 7s , they have granted and the Vestry taken up the sum of £1,700 HAMMERSMITH VESTRY During the year 1890-91 the total sum of £560 17s 5d has

IMPROVEMENTS A sum of £100 has been received under this heading during the past year from the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, being a contribution towards the cost of planting trees in the Parish At 25th March, 1891, the sum of £55 14s 6d had been expended LOCAL TAXATION RETURNS Under 23 and 24 Victoria, c 51, and 40 and 41 Victoria, c 67, it is enacted that every Vestry, District Board, &c , shall make a return annually of the sums levied or received by or in interest of rates, taxes, &c , and of the expenditure thereof, to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State Under the above Acts the Statistical Department of the Local Government Board issue, during the month of July or August in each year, a form embracing the various heads of receipts and expenditure and of loans, &c , employed by local authorities On the 28th of July, 1890, forms (in duplicate) for the Local Taxation Returns were received by this Vestry, and referred to me to fill up This was duly done, and on my presenting same to the Finance Committee, they instructed the Clerk to return the form to the Local Government Board PRECEPTS OF CORPORATE BODIES The Central Boards issuing precepts on the Vestry were the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London; now the latter only, as the precept of the London County Council, the successors of the late Metropolitan Board of Works, is made on the Guardians of Fulham Union, and so becomes chargeable on the Poor Rate instead of the Local Rates, as was formerly the case with the Consolidated Rate The following statement will

in January, 1890, when presenting same to the Finance Committee of the Fulham Vestry, I read the following statement, relating to the rates likely to be levied during tha ensuing y- ar :— " The precept of the School Board for London for the first half of the financial year 1890-91 amounts to £8,050 4s 10d , being an increase of £1,746 17s 9d over that of the corresponding period of last year, and an increase of £747 9s 2d on the second half year's precept, or assuming the call for the whole year to be in the same ratio as the call now made, viz :— nominally 10|d in the £, the increase for the year will amount to £2,773 3s Id (being 2T3¥d in £ more than last year) " With regard to the rate required to raise the sum called for, an account must be taken (in calculating the amount in the £ on the assessment) of the fact that at least 16 per cent. must be deducted for empties, compositions to owners, irreeoverables, and for other causes, while the amount to Be raised must necessarily be increased to such a sum, that will both enable the Overseers to liquidate the precept and to pay the cost of collection and other expenses " I estimate the net rate for next half year to be 5 j-|d in £, or say, for the year a little over ll|d in the £ " 82 NEW STREETS With reference to the New Streets Accounts, during the past year, there has been received the sum of £26,103 9s l1d on account of Apportionments made The amounts still due by contributors are—On Old Roads, transferred to this Vestry by the late District Board of Works, the sum of £216 7s 4d , and on the Streets taken to by this Vestry during the past five years the sum of £25,431 2s 5d , making the total due on New Streets to be £25,647 9s 9d On pages Nos 120—125 will be found statements of New Streets Account in detail In February, 1891, a long discussion took place at the New Streets Committee on financial and other matters connected with the "New Streets" Department, and I was requested to answer the following question: "How many new streets does the amount of money in hand refer to?" The following is my reply, viz :— The New Streets Account receives monies from both paving and sewering works, and may be classified under 3 headings, viz :— 1 Works done and paid for 2 Works advertised and contracted for, and 3 Work not yet contracted for No 1 There can be no monies in hand with regard to this heading, for when the Contractors have been paid, the surplus is returned to those who have paid their apportionments in full, thus leaving on 54 paving works and 1 sewering work a debt due to the New Streets Account of £2,200 12s lid , being the balance of the 25 per cent. of the apportionments not yet paid by sundry contributors No 2 Works in progress In regard to this heading the accounts stand as follows, viz 24 streets—amount now in hand £9,400 13 5 2 sewers do 1,543 2 8 £10,943 16 1 No 3 Works not yet contracted for With regard to this heading the accounts stand as follows:— 24 streets —amount now in hand £6,461 15 4 5 sewers— Do 1,867 0 0 £8,328 15 4 On 15 streets apportioned nothing has yet been received LABOUR, &c —WAGES ACCOUNT The parishioners will form some idea of the rapid development of the Parish by the comparative statement of the Labour Wages Accounts for 1886 and that of 1891 On the 27th day of January, 1886, the Yestry passed the following resolution, on the recommendation of the Works Committee:— That in order to efficiently carry out the works required in the making, maintaining, and cleansing of the streets and sewers in the Parish, a staff of Artisans and Labourers be employed as follows:— 30 Scavengers Average weekly wages, £76 0 0 " 1 Ganger 4 Spreaders 12 Ground and Sewermen 1 Ganger 1 Bricklayer 1 Labourer 1 Mason 1 Labourer 6 Flushers and Gullymen 1 Depot Watchman 1 Storekeeper and Messenger 1 Engine Driver Pecking Gang, averaging 6 men, as required ^ 83 At the same time the Cartage Department Staff of Labourers consisted of the following:— 10 Dustmen, with horses Average weekly wages, £32 0 0 5 „ without horses 9 Carmen, with horses 1 Odd Man 1 Horsekeeper 1 Stableman The following shows the number of men, and average weekly cost in 1890 :— Works Department:— 53 Scavengers Average weekly wages, £135 0 0 \ 1

horses Average weekly wages, £75 0 0 7 „ without horses 24 Carmen, with horses 2 Odd Men 1 Watchman 2 Horsekeepers 3 Wheelwrights 1 Painter 2 Farriers or Smiths In addition to the above, extra men are put on as occasion requires for special works, or in case of a heavy fall of snow, etc ESTIMATES During the past year the Yestry estimated the amount required to be raised by Rates to meet its expenses, and the call of other bodies, to be as follows:— 1889-90 1890-91 General Rate, viz :— £ s d £ s d Loans 6,800 10 1 7,381 14 9 Works Department 9,391 5 6 9,874 2 8 Cartage „ 9,253 5 0 9,980

4 ” 0 4 „ Sewers „ 0 4 ” 0 3 ,, Metropolitan Consolidated Rate 0 3 ” nil 3 4 ” 3 2 „ The increase of 2d in the £ on the General Rate is brought about by the many works and improvements effected by the vestry during the past year, and the purchase of additional horses and rolling stock, necessitating greater cartage expenses, &c , in addition to the liabilities of the previous year, which had to be provided for out of this Rate, as well as the large increase in the School Board Rate of over £3,300, and thereby causing the issuing of precepts for a larger amount than in 1889-90 85 The Lighting Rate shows a decrease in the amount called for, though the Overseers have been unable to reduce the amount in the £ of the rates This is due to the' fact that the vestry had a fair balance in hand at the time of making the Rate, and not through any decrease in the lighting of the Parish The increase in the amount called for on the Sewer Rate is due to the extra sewer works, emptying of cesspools and flushing of sewers, but the Overseers had sufficient balance in hand to keep the rate down to 3d in the £ The Metropolitan Board of Works being extinct, the Consolidated Rate is no longer levied, as their successors, the London County Council, charge their expenses on the Poor Rate The following is a copy of the detailed estimate:— The Yestry of the Parish of Fulham, Accountant's Department,

PARISH OF FULHAM. Town Hall, Walham Green, S.W. AUDITORS' CERTIFICATE. We, the undersigned Auditors of the Accounts of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham for the financial year ending 25th March, 1891, hereby certify that we have examined the books of the Vestry, and have compared the vouchers with the £ s. d. cheques, and we find the balance of 23,818 12 4 at the Bankers on Current and Deposit Accounts to be correct, and allowing for the outstanding cheques, amounting to 166 7 11 the balance to be £23,652 4 5 We have also examined the Loan Account of the Vestry, and we find that the loans, including £31,000 borrowed during the past year, amount to £80,718 18 8 In accordance with the reference of the previous Auditors calling our attention to the illegal payment to the professional Auditors of £31 10s., we are in duty bound to sur-charge the same, which we accordingly do, and which will increase the balance of the Vestry by that amount. We see that the Vestry has taken no action with regard to the recommendation of last year's Auditors that the Solicitor's bills of costs should be taxed, therefore we are unable to allow the sum of £849 12s. 1d., being the amount paid by the Vestry to their Solicitor during the past year, and therefore declare the balance to be increased by that amount. We find in re Winfield, which case was won by the Vestry, the difference between the original account of £53 13s. 10d., and the amount of £28 14s. allowed by the Taxing Master was charged to, and paid by, the Vestry, and we are of opinion that, if these bills were submitted to the Taxing Master, a large allowance would be made in favour of the Vestry. We are of opinion that the Vestry should enter into contracts for the repairs to wheels, nose bags, harness, flushing hose, &c., as we have noticed the apparently excessive cost of repairing same, as against the cost of new articles. We likewise recommend that in future the Vestry do buy green meat forage by weight instead of bundle; also seeing that £2 10s. per month is paid for cleaning the windows of the Town Hall to an outside Company, we think it should be the duty of the Hall keepers, with a little assistance, to do the work in a similar way to that in which it is done at the Board Schools, viz., to clean all windows within reach once a month, and the remainder once in six months. We find that £212 10s. has been paid by the Vestry for the emptying of cesspools in the Parish; we are of the same opinion as the previous Auditors, that it should be charged to the Owners. We see that £272 18s. 3d. has been expended in disinfecting goods, &c., during the past year, and we feel bound to agree with the previous Auditors' report, that a great saving would be effected by the Vestry having its own disinfector. We notice that the Vestry is paying Mr. Bagley 8d. per load for a slop shoot as against 4d. per load paid to Mr. Hunt, and we are of opinion that some other 92 means should be devised to dispose of the house refuse than paying 1s. 7d. per load to Mr. Bagley to create a little mountain, which may in the near future become a nuisance, to say nothing of the fact that with the amount paid for shoots, viz., £1,671 18s. 5d., sufficient land could have been bought to have buried the whole of it. Looking at the previous Auditors' report relating to New Streets, we have great pleasure in complimenting the New Streets Committee and Officials on the manner in which they have reduced the outstanding amount on streets completed, viz., from £3,634 13s. 2d. to £1,981 8s., including several roads finished during the year, but we personally know that there are many persons still, who are able to pay if pressed, and we hope the arrears will be further reduced during the present year, especially on those roads transferred from the late District Board five years ago. We note with surprise that the Town Hall account is overdrawn £6,162 19s. 3d., and that this amount does not appear to be owing is due to the fact that on the Permanent Works account, the other accounts, viz., Property, Improvement and Wood Paving Loans accounts are in credit to the extent of £11,358 18s. 4d. Seeing that the vestry now possesses ample strong room accommodation, we suggest that an iron box should be obtained in which to place the deeds now in the possession of the Solicitor, together with those in the possession of the Clerk, and also the guarantee and other bonds in possession of the Yicar. We wish to place on record that the accounts have been kept in a most satisfactory manner, and we have to thank Mr. Meyer, the Accountant, and the other officers of the Yestry for the cheerful and able manner in which they have assisted us during the audit.

NORRINGTON, Assoc. Mem. Inst. C.E., Member of Incorporated Association of Engineers, Surveyor to the Vestry of Fulham. . ■ . - . Destry of the Parish of fulham ANNUAL REPORT of the SURVEYOR FOR THE YEAR 1890-91. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I present to you herewith my fifth Annual Report of works and matters connected with my department for the year commencing on the 25th of March, 1890, and ending on the 25th of March, 1891. I have again retained the corresponding figures for the previous years in the tabulated statements, as the tables are more useful for the purpose of estimating future expenditure when the figures are given for a series of years. AREA OF THE PARISH. The area of the Parish of Fulham is 1700.324 acres. Area of Foreshore 56.561 ,, Area of'Tidal Water 99.614 ,, Total 1856.499 COMPARATIVE TABLE. Showing the increase in the population, length of roads, footpaths, &c., of the Parish since the separation from Hammersmith in 1886. The census taken on the 5th day of April, 1891, gave the population at 91,640, being 42,850 males, and 48,790 females. There were also 797 unoccupied houses, and 339 in course of erection. The population at the previous census in 1881 was 42,895. Length of Carriage way. Length of Poo-ways to same. Length of Public Footways where no Carriage-way. Estimated Population. Inhabited Houses.

The amount allowed annually for granite by the Fulham District Board of Works was £2,400, and although the traffic in this district has probably more than trebled since that time, in addition to the enormous numbers of omnibuses now running in and through the Parish, the Vestry have reduced the amount of the estimates, sometimes to £1,500, sometimes to £1,000, and for the year 1891-2 to £1,137 10s., although the price of granite has increased during these years from about 11s. to 14s. 3d. a cubic yard. My first Annual Report pointed out that the best, and practically the cheapest, policy is to maintain as far as possible a macadamised road in a perfect condition, because immediately it gets out of repair the wet remains on the surface and assists the deterioration. The estimates are now so reduced, and granite so sparingly supplied, that for months in the year the Vestry is without granite, so that it is impossible to follow out the policy suggested above. Too much importance has been attached to the lengths of roadway paved with wood each year, and the quality and quantity of the old granite macadam taken off these roads. This old granite is not suitable for the repair of roads unless it has a coating of new over it, and therefore, while making every allowance for the value of this material, in face of the additional number of roads (now 85 against 24 in 1886) paved with granite, and the enormous increase of traffic in the district, the Vestry ought not for the future to reduce the estimate below £3,000 a year and always to keep a certain amount, if only one hundred yards, in stock. The Vestry might also pay more attention to the suggestions in my previous reports, viz.—To purchase some granite broken to pass through a two-inch ring, it being more suitable for mending roads; also to inform the contractors that in the future the order for the whole of the granite required for the year will be given during the summer months (when freights are low), by which means the price might be reduced perhaps to 10/6 a yard, and a saving effected of 3/9 a yard, on 4,200 yards equal to £787 10s. 151 FLINTS.

On the 2nd of April, 1890, the Vestry purchased ten tons of asphalte at a cost of £35, and two tons of bitumen costing £20. A new asphalte cauldron was also purchased. The Vestry has not, however, done any asphalting or tar paving during the year, except such as may have been required for the repair of trenches. WOOD PAYING. Locality. Area. Date Laid. Description.

Amount of Tender, £3,990. 152 The paving of the Fulham Road, commenced in September, and finished in November, was the largest wood paving contract the Vestry has carried out, being 1,900 yards, or 1 mile 140 yards in length of a most important thoroughfare. The paving of North End Road, for which the tender was accepted 12th November, 1890, was commenced in January, but not completed on the 25th March, 1891, so that the full particulars will not appear in this report. The Yestry, acting upon my advice, have adopted creosoted deal blocks for the Fulham and North End Roads, instead of plain deal. Each block is cut under the eye of an inspector and placed in a cylinder, the temperature in the cylinder is then raised to 220°, and the steam generated by the heat is withdrawn by means of an air pump, so that the blocks are thoroughly dry. The creosote is then forced into the blocks at a pressure of 120 lbs. to the square inch, and to the amount of at least 10 lbs. to every cubic foot of deal. Before being used each supply of creosote is subjected to analysis by the analyst to the Vestry and certified to be satisfactory. Samples of the blocks from each cylinder are tested to see that the proper quantity of creosote has been compressed into them, and frequently the test has shown as much as 15 and 16 lb. of creosote compressed into a cubic foot of the wood. Great attention is given to the wood before it is placed in the cylinders, each block being separately examined, and as many as 15 to 25 per cent, of the blocks have sometimes been rejected. The Yestry have received from the London County Council loans of £12,300 to cover the cost of the wood-paving Fulham Road, and £4,200 for the woodpaving North End Road. During the year 65,000 wood blocks have been obtained for repairing the wood pavements. The wood-paving laid in 1885 in the Fulham Road will soon, I fear, require to be entirely relaid. ASPHALTE FOR CARRIAGE-WAYS. The Yestry having decided to pave Farm Lane, which leads to the Road Car. Co's stables, with asphalte, tenders were invited for the work, and the tender of the French Asphalte Co., amounting to £1,129 5s., was accepted on the 4th March 1891. The specification provides for two inches of compressed asphalte on six inches of Portland cement concrete, and the price works out at 13/- per yard super for the asphalte and concrete, exclusive of excavation and carting away. PORTLAND CEMENT. A very large quantity of cement is used by the different contractors to the Yestry, and great attention is paid to the quality. Every lot supplied is tested, and unless it bears the test satisfactorily it is rejected. The test has resulted in several lots of cement being found to be too new to be fit for use. The chief danger with reference to cement in London appears to be that the manufacturers have been unable to supply it fast enough, and new cement is therefore supplied to the contractors. 153 LIST OF PUBLIC STREETS, With Description and Approximate Depth of Sewer, and Lengths of Carriageways and Footways.

There are 3 miles 7 furlongs 26 yards of main sewers in this parish, which are vested in the London County Council. The sewers belonging to the Vestry are 4 miles 300 yards of bricks and .29 miles 1,657 yards of pipe sewers. On the 5th of November, 1890, I having made the following report to the Vestry:— Re SEWERS. "I beg to report that I do not know of any sewers in this Parish in an "insanitary condition, and it is not satisfactory to place such a term on "the agenda, as I have reason to believe that the sewers in this Parish are "much above the average of the sewers in London in respect to ventilation. "There have been a few complaints of the street ventilators, which the "Vestry have in most instances either dealt with or the work is in hand. "The chief complaint, that in the Crondace Road, in my opinion, arises "from the condition of the sewer in the King's Road, belonging to the "London County Council, and I should recommend the Committee, before "going to the expense of carrying ventilators up the sides of the houses, "which will in my opinion be a somewhat unsatisfactory course, as the pre"sent area of the ventilators is 63 square inches, and the area of the venti"lators to be substituted cannot exceed 32 inches, to place an additional "ventilator in the roadway between the Crondace and King's Roads. If then "the nuisance continues, the erection of the ventilators up the sides of the "houses can be proceeded with, and cowls fixed to create a current of air. "I shall also be glad if the Committee will give me permission to order "50 of the new manhole covers, so that I can continue the work of fixing "them over the manholes that at present have no ventilation. "I have written to the London County Council pointing out that the "ventilators to their sewers average 700 feet apart, whereas this Yestry "place them 200 feet apart, and if the Council attend to this matter "and the Yestry allow me to supply the ventilators to the manholes, as "I have asked above, I think there will be very little reason even for "solitary complaints in the future, and wherever these should occur the "Vestry can arrange to provide special air shafts." 162 The Vestry instructed me to write specially to the London County Council with reference to the ventilation of their sewer in the King's Road. In my previous Annual Reports, and also from time to time, I have made full reports concerning the sewers in this Parish. These reports have contained a number of recommendations, upon many of which the Vestry have acted, in reference to the construction of new sewers and 121 additional ventilators and manhole covers of a greatly improved pattern, and 7 ventilating shafts have been fixed to many of the old sewers. There are, however, some of the recommendations, in reference to the old sewers which are insufficiently ventilated, which should be carried out. These are the construction of a number of additional manholes, for the purpose of obtaining better access to the sewers and for the purpose of better ventilation, the connection of the deadend of sewers with the nearest adjoining sewer, and the providing rest lamps as ventilators, and more ventilating shafts. I have at every possible opportunity called the attention of the Vestry to the advisability of using rest lamps as ventilators, but I regret to say that the suggestion has not yet been adopted in this Parish in a single instance. The sewers under the control of the London County Council in this district are also inefficiently ventilated, having been constructed many years ago before so much attention was given to the subject. The whole of the sewers in the district are also liable to be surcharged at time of heavy rains, so that frequently the water floods the cellars of houses, and the sewers remain charged for many hours. This seems to point to an insufficiency of pumping power at the Victoria pumping station, and the attention of the Council might be called to this matter and that of the insufficient ventilation. The Vestry have purchased during the year 74 improved ventilating manhole covers, which, except those fixed on the Peterborough Villas sewer, have been placed over existing sewers. On the 14th of November, 1890, a person was fined 40s. and costs for making an opening in a sewer without previously obtaining the written permission of the Vestry. 163 LIST OF DRAINAGE PLANS APPROVED BY VESTRY Case No. Locality.

For unstopping drains 9 different sums, amounting to £44, have been passed over to the Accountant 169 RE DRAINAGE OF BUILDINGS. It will be seen from the above table that the erection of new houses is still being carried on at a rapid rate in this District. The appointment of a Drainage Inspector on the 5th March, 1890, has enabled the Vestry to exercise a much more efficient control over the construction of the drainage of houses, and consequently a greatly improved system of drainage has been adopted. The Inspector has also been able to test, many of the new drains constructed, with water. It is, in my opinion, advisable that all drains should be tested; and before any house is allowed to be occupied, the owner ought to be obliged to produce a certificate from the Surveyor that the drains have been laid in a satisfactory manner. In that case, a reasonable fee should be charged the owner for such a certificate, which would be of great value to him. If, however, the Vestry undertake this work additional inspectors will be required. The regulations adopted by the Vestry with respect to drainage are not, in my opinion, satisfactory in many particulars and should be revised. On the 18th October, 1890, a builder was fined 40s. and costs for proceeding with the drainage of the houses before making the connection to the main sewer in the road. DUST.

I have again to call the attention of the Vestry to the recommendations in my previous reports, by adopting which I believe an amount would be saved per annum equal to a rate of l½d. in the £. One of the first things the Vestry should do in connection with this question is to carry out my repeated recommendations to purchase several acres of land by the river, so as to be in a position to deal with the dust in any manner that may hereafter appear desirable. Particulars and suggestions concerning the various methods adopted elsewhere have appeared in my previous reports. STREET CLEANSING. The Vestry now constantly employ for the purpose of cleansing the streets, gullies and sewers, etc., an average of 77 men, together with extra help when required; also 34 horses and carts, 4 street sweeping machines, 4 road scrapers, and 4 sanding machines and 6 orderly hand carts. In June six persons were fined five shillings and costs for sweeping rubbish into the streets. SLOPPING. Vestry's Horses. Hired Horses. No. of Loads. Price per Horse. Cost of Carting. Whole Days.

It is satisfactory to know that some of the papers spoke of our parish as standing "highest in the estimation of the drivers" for spreading sand in frosty weather. Throughout the severe weather extra men were employed in addition to those clearing snow, with a view of affording some relief to the unemployed. Year. Extra Wages Paid.

This makes the cost of a snowfall very great, and I calculate that the Vestry spent last winter £787 10s. Od. over the clearance of snow and sanding streets. CLEANSING GULLIES. Vest'y's Horses.

The Yestry having decided to advertise for tenders for maintenance of lamps, the tender of Messrs.

Arrangements have also been made with the Gas Co. for a new lighting table, and 100 copies have been printed and circulated amongst the members of the Vestry. GAS AND "WATER, COMPANIES. The following table shows the number of openings, and the amounts paid each year for repairs of same (from 25th March, 1887, to 25th March, 1891), by the Gas and Water Companies:— 179 Chelsea Waterworks West Middlesex Gas Light and Coke Totals Company.

Having advised the Yestry that the charges made to the Gas and Water Company for repairs to trenches barely covered the cost of the work, I received instructions to revise the prices, and on the 12th November, 1890, the Yestry adopted the following scale:— Old Price. New Price. Any Quantity over four yards.

A new form of Hoarding Licence, more stringent in its conditions, has been adopted. I have again to call the attention of the Yestry to the advisability of empowering me to exercise more supervision over hoardings in new streets where, at present, building materials are placed without any protection, to the great danger of passengers. MISCELLANEOUS. For paving works and removing lamps, &c., twelve different sums, amounting to £40 15s. have been received by this department during the year. LAYING STRAW IN ROADS. For permission to lay straw in roads, three different sums, amounting to £3 2s., have been received during the year. ROAD SWEEPINGS. The sum of £1 1s. has been received for road sweepings, and 3s. for granite siftings, during the year. HOARDING LICENCES. Date. No. of Licences, granted.

The erection of the new stables and workshops having provided the Yestry with commodious and suitable premises, the staff of workmen has been increased by 3 wheelwrights, 1 farrier, and 1 dorman, and the Yestry has commenced the construction of rolling stock. After this work had continued some time, I prepared a report on the relative cost of work carried out by our own workmen as against purchasing, and found that in a certain period 21 carts were sent to be repaired, costing <£68 15s., or an average of £3 5s. 6d. per cart, 6 water vans costing £8 15s., or an average cost of £1 9s. 2d. per van, and 1 dog cart costing £4. The total amount spent for 28 repairs being £81 13s. 6d., or an average of £2 18s. 4d., against 41 repairs executed by the Yestry's workmen, costing £71 2s. llgd., or an average of £1 14s. 8d. each. Besides repairs, 4 slop carts, 4 shoot carts, 2 dust carts, 6 orderly hand carts, and 12 box barrows were constructed. STEAM ROLLER. During the year new wheels and other repairs have been made to the steam roller at a cost of £70, and during one part of the time the Yestry had to hire another roller at a cost of £27.

The tenders for the construction of a River Wall and Wharf on this site were received by the Yestry on the 24th July, 1889, and accepted. Messrs. Mayo and Co. were instructed to commence on the 3rd day of April, 1890, when, owing to the delay on the part of the Vestry, they asked that an additional sum of £50 be given, making the amount of their tender £2,250. The London County Council granted a loan of £2,500 to cover the cost of the work. WHARF. The Yestry having in view the desirability of purchasing a large area of land by the river as a wharf for the purpose of dealing with the future requirements of the Parish, with respect to barging away the dust and slop and other matters, decided on the 14th January, 1891, to purchase about 10 acres of land by the river. Enquiries have therefore been made concerning available sites, although up to the present time no actual purchase has taken place. BISHOP'S MEADOW. Negotiations have been proceeded with during the year with the London County Council for the purpose of inducing them to take over as a Park the land known as Bishop's and West Meadows, and carry out the various works required at their own expense. Up to the present no definite determination has been arrived at by the Council. The nearest approach has been a recommendation of the Improvements Committee to take over the cost of constructing the wall which was referred back by the Council, and the Parks Committee have carried a recommendation to contribute £1,500 towards the cost of laying out the land estimated at £2,500. The following important letter has been received from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, concerning the Meadows, from which it would appear that unless some immediate and substantial progress is made with the required works, the Yestry are in danger of losing the benefits intended to be conferred by the original grant:— " Ecclesiastical Commission, "10, Whitehall Place, London, S. W. "16th January, 1891. " File No. 65,147.—Meadow and River Bank at Fulham. " The Ecclesiastical Commissioners direct me to request that you will " draw the special attention of the Yestry of Fulham in the matter of the " land, situate between the River Thames and the Moat of Fulham Palace, " which in the year 1884 was granted by themselves and the Bishop of " London, on certain conditions, to the Board of Works for the Fulham " District, to be maintained as an open space or pleasure ground for the " enjoyment of the inhabitants. " The Commissioners regret to find that the conditions attached to that " grant, with reference to the fencing, laying out, and maintenance of the " ground, are still unfulfilled, and that the ground has been allowed to " remain in a useless and unsightly condition, which thereby to a great " extent defeats the object of the grant. 185 "The Commissioners are aware that the Vestry has been in correspondence "with the London County Council on the subject of obtaining pecuniary "assistance, from the funds controlled by that body, towards the outlay "required to do what is needful. "The Commissioners are not aware of the result of that correspondence, "but they must remind the Vestry that the fulfilment of the conditions "annexed to the grant is a responsibility resting solely upon them (the "Vestry) as being the body now holding the land under the grant of 1884, "and they cannot acquiesce in any indefinite postponement of the execution "of the necessary work on account of any questions which may be pending "between the Vestry and another public body. "Furthermore, the Commissioners must remind the Vestry that the offer "made in February, 1889, to grant, as an addition to the recreation ground, "a valuable piece of meadow land lying on the west side of the Bishop's "Avenue, was specifically made conditional on the speedy and effective "fulfilment by the Vestry of their obligations with regard to the first"mentioned land. "Nearly two years have elapsed since that offer was made, and, unless "steps are taken by the Vestry, without further delay, to put in proper "order, for use and enjoyment by the public, the land comprised in the "grant, the Commissioners will be compelled to name an early date, after "which the offer must be considered as withdrawn. I am, Sir, "Your very obedient Servant, "W. J. Denselow, Esq., "A. DE BOCK PORTER. "Town Hall, Walham Green, S.W." OPEN SPACE CORNER OF FULHAM PALACE ROAD AND CROWN ROAD. This land, having an area of about nine acres, has been considered to be a site suitable for a park, and I was instructed by the Vestry on the 9th July to prepare a plan of it. Negotiations were afterwards entered into with the owners of the land (the Ecclesiastical Commissioners), and they have agreed to sell it to the Vestry for the purpose of a park at the rate of £1,250 per acre. My estimate for laying out the land was as follows:— £ s. d. Fencing 357 18 9 Sewer apportionment 380 9 6 Draining land 436 0 0 Kerbing, paving, and channeling the streets adjoining 608 5 0 Planting 427 10 0 Forming carriageways and footways 1058 £3268 15 18 0 5 186 TRAMWAYS. The West London Tramways Company renewed their application for permission to lay a tramway down the Hammersmith Road so far as the entrance to Olympia, proposing to form the terminus in the approach road to Olympia. On the 21st January, 1891, a deputation of ratepayers attended before the Vestry, and asked the Vestry to oppose the scheme. This the Vestry almost unanimously decided to do, and the scheme has not been proceeded with further within the boundaries of this parish. ELECTRIC LIGHT. In July, 1890, notices were served on the Vestry on behalf of the London Electrical Engineering Company, Limited, the British Electrical Engineering Company, House to House Electric Supply Company, Limited, and the Stamford Hill, Tottenham, and Edmonton Electric Light and Power Supply, Limited, stating their intention to apply to the Board of Trade, in due course, for provisional orders under the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 to 1888, to be confirmed in the ensuing session of Parliament, but no further action was taken by the companies. The Vestry received a letter from the Board of Trade forwarding an application for a firm to purchase from the West Middlesex Electric Light Company the undertaking authorised by the Fulham District Electric Lighting Order, 1884, under the provisions of section 69, sub-section (c), and the Vestry informed the Board of Trade that it strongly objected to the order being resuscitated in any way. ELECTRICAL TRAMWAYS. An application made on behalf of the Chelsea Electrical Supply Cdmpany, Limited, for permission to obtain a provisional order authorising them to run electrical tramways through the Parish, along the Fulham Road and King's Road, was not acceded to. LAMMAS RIGHTS. A great number of meetings have been held in respect of the claim of Rights of Lammas over certain lands known as townmeads adjoining the river, and on the 17th September, 1890, the Vestry ordered me to parade six horses over this land. I carried out my instructions on the 1st day of December, 1890, as set forth in the report which was printed on the minutes, and of which the following is a copy 1st December, 1890. To the Chairman and Members of the Lammas Rights Committee. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Re LAMMAS LANDS. I beg to report that in company with Mr. Jones, Superintendent cf Roads, and Mr. March, the Chairman of the Lammas Rights Committee, 187 and six horses belonging to the Vestry, I attended at the bottom of Peterboro' Lane this afternoon at three o'clock. I there met the head gardener of Miss Sulivan, and informed him that I was going to take the horses on the Lammas Lands occupied by Miss Sulivan (numbered 20 in red letters on the plan prepared by me to accompany Mr. Birkett's report). He declined to open the gate, of which he said he had the keys, and I therefore instructed the men to lift the gate off its hinges; this was done, and I entered the ground leading the first horse, the other horses following. The horses were allowed to graze for a few minutes, and we proceeded to the next piece of land. Land occupied by Asylums Board (No. 19 on plan referred to). The man in charge refused admission. The smith in the employ of the Vestry, acting on my instructions, climbed over the gate, broke the padlock, and the horses entered and grazed for a few minutes. St. John's Wharf (No. 18 on plan)., Here there was no resistance; the horses entered, and I left my card with the occupier, stating the object of our proceedings. Premises occupied by Mr. James Davies, Town Mead Road (No. 17 on plan). Mr. James Davies refused to allow me to enter, and kept a horse and cart at the gate, entirely blocking the way. On my trying to enter he pushed me back by the shoulder. Premises occupied by Messrs. Tagent and Pochin (No. 16 on plan). The horses were taken into the ground. I left my name with the occupier explaining the object of the visit, and he protested against the action of the Vestry. Premises occupied by Mr. Black (No. 15 on plan). The horses were taken into the ground. No opposition was offered. Premises occupied by Messrs. Johnson, Wandsworth Bridge Road (No. 14 on plan). The gates were open, and the horses entered. I saw Mr. Johnson, and he said had he known we were coming he would not have allowed the horses to enter. Land claimed by Mr. Blythe, solicitor (No. 12 on plan); Mr. Ayres tenant. Mr. Ayres protested, and refused to open the gate. The men pulled the staple out of the post so that the gate could be opened, and the horses entered. Mr. Harrison (No. 11 on plan). No opposition. Kop's Brewery (No. 10 on plan). Mr. Harris, the manager, opposed the Vestry, and the men broke the padlock in order to open the gates, and the horses entered. Land occupied by Mr. Gibson (No. 9 on plan). The men broke down one barrier and one wire fence, and the horses entered. A piece of this ground appears newly boarded in, and I did not see a way to get into it readily. Land occupied by Mr. Coles (Nos. 5, 6, and 7 on plan). There being no fence, passed throngh without opposition. I left my card with his representative. 188 Land occupied by Gas Company (No. 4 on plan). The horses walked right through this land, the fences being already broken down. No opposition. Tt having become dark, I did not enter plots 3, 1, and 21, and part of plot 4 occupied by the Gas Company, Inspector Brown, Sergeant Keates, Police Constables Yeates, Beales, and Wetham were present during the proceedings, and gave assistance in preventing any actions of a disorderly character. I remain, yours faithfully, JAMES P. NORRINGTON, A.M.I.C.E., Surveyor to the Vestry. Arising out of this, Mr. H. Lowenfeld, Mr. John Johnson, Mr. Heatley, and Messrs. Last, have issued writs against the Vestry for trespass. CROMWELL ROAD BRIDGE. This scheme has been again under the consideration of the London County Council, who appear to think it a favourable opportunity for testing the betterment principle, and it is proposed to adopt it in connection with the construction of this bridge. Deputations have waited on the Council in reference to it, and many communications passed; and on the 18th March, 1891, the Vestry passed the following resolution:— That the Vestry agree to pay one-third of the London County Council's Estimate of £52,500, or any lesser sum, for building the Cromwell Road Bridge 50 feet wide, and acquiring the property necessary for the approaches to be 60 feet wide, providing the London County Council will grant a loan to the Vestry for the one-third which the Vestry agree to pay, and allow the repayments of the same, to extend over a term of 60 years and further providing the London County Council will undertake to carry out the improvement. And the Vestry do recommend the London County Council to levy an improvement rate on all the property owners in the immediate locality benefited by the improvement, such owners not to be called upon to contribute more than one-third of the estimated cost, together with the cost of collection on the improvement rate, with legal interest, the whole to be obtained as a loan for 60 years, the same to be payable by a deferred payment extending over, if possible, 60 years; and, in the event of the London County Council inserting clauses in the Bill for power to levy such improvement rate on the owners, the Vestry agree to support the same by a petition in favour to Parliament. CHURCH STREET IMPROVEMENT The work of this improvement is progressing, many properties having been pulled down and the ground cleared. 189 On the 10th December, 1890, the Vestry instructed me to write to the County Council, offering to carry out the work by the Vestry's workmen at cost price, with 5 per cent. added for office expenses. The Council not accepting this, and having asked for a definite tender, the Vestry, on the 4th March, 1891, offered to do the work for the sum of £2,220. The County Council did not appear to have been satisfied with this offer, but advertised for and obtained tenders, the lowest of which amounted to £2,153. Later on, when the Council appear to have reconsidered the Vestry's offer, and offered to allow the Vestry to do the work for £2,220, the Vestry in the meanwhile having raised the wages of nearly all their employes, decided to leave the matter in the hands of the County Council. ROAD BETWEEN PERHAM ROAD AND MAY STREET. Negotiations have been entered into during the year with the view of throwing this open to the public, and part of the land has been acquired. The London County Council have agreed to contribute the sum of £219 13s. 4d. towards the cost. TRAFALGAR HOUSE, FULHAM ROAD. This property, belonging to the Vestry, is for sale. It has remained unoccupied for a considerable time, and some special effort should be made to dispose of it. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES. On the 19th July the Vestry sold the site in the Broadway, Walham Green, occupied by a urinal, for the sum of £455. Many plans have been made for the construction of conveniences to be placed underground in the Broadway and Eelbrook Common, but as yet the Vestry have not adopted any particular scheme. The District Railway tunnel is in the way of the construction of one in the Broadway. INSANITARY AREAS. In April, 1890, I made plans of Garden Row, Russell's Cottages, Stanley Cottages, and premises in Star Road, which, in my opinion, were insanitary areas. And in June, 1890, I prepared a report for the Sanitary Committee on the Acts of Parliament relative to the Artisans' Dwellings Acts. Since that date, a new Act, known as the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 53 and 54 Vic., cap. 70, has been passed, and the method, of procedure relating to these matters has been considerably changed. This new Act will create considerable extra work for my department, as many of the clauses require the certificate of the surveyor or engineer before action can be taken. In July I reported on all the supposed Insanitary Areas in the Parish, but no definite action has been taken up to the present. 190 LIST OF TREES BELONGING TO THE VESTRY. « Streets.

I was also instructed to plant a number of trees in the Wandsworth Bridge Road, and 100 trees were bought for that purpose at a cost of 7s. a tree and planted, making a total of 123 trees planted during the year. The Metropolitan Public Gardens Association have granted this Vestry £100, to be spent in planting trees. On the 7th December, 1890, the Vestry accepted a tender to prune all the trees in the parish for the sum of £10. MAP OF PARISH. The Vestry having last year ordered Messrs. Wyld and Co. to prepare a new and complete plan of the district at a cost of £260, on the 10th December, 1890, decided to have twenty-five sets lithographed at an additional cost of £125. 191 DRINKING THOUGH. On the 15th October, 1890, the offer of the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain Association to place a drinking trough in the Fulham Road, at the junction of Moore Park Road, was accepted by the Vestry, and a handsome granite trough has been fixed accordingly. MAIN ROADS. Application was made on the 25th April, 1889, to the London County Council to take over some miles of roads in the Parish, all of which appeared to be main roads, under the provisions of the Act quoted hereafter in the letter of the London County Council. To this application the London County Council replied as follows, on the 21st May, 1890 London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W. 21st May, 1890. Sir,—Referring to your letter of the 4th of April, 1889, and the letter from the Surveyor of the Vestry of the 25th of the same month, asking on behalf of the Vestry of Fulham, that certain thoroughfares in the Parish, specified in the report of the Vestry Surveyor forwarded with his letter, may be declared by the Council to be main roads under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1888, sections 11 and 41 (4), and the Highways and Locomotives Act, 1878, I have to inform you that the Council, having considered the application of the Vestry, is of opinion that there is not probable cause for such application, aud declines to accede to it. I have to ask that you will be good enough to lay this letter before the Vestry of Fulham. I am, sir, Your obedient servant, H. DE LA HOOKE, The Clerk of the Vestry of Fulham. Clerk to the Council. There can be no doubt that such a road as the Fulham Road is a main road under the definitions given in the Acts; but the Council have probably felt that the duty of maintaining such roads would be too onerous; and, further, that the carrying out of the Act would lead to endless questions as to whether roads were main roads or not. For instance, the application of this Vestry alone embraced 9 miles 2 furlongs and 182 yards of roads. I believe the County Council have decided to apply for the repeal of that part of the Act which refers to those main roads, "other than disturnpiked roads" within the Metropolitan area. ACTS OF PARLIAMENT. Many important Acts of Parliament were passed in 1890. Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1890. I reported on this Act in October, 1890, as follows:— By sec. 3 of the above-mentioned Act, the Vestry have power to repair any carriageway which has been used for public traffic for more than six 192 months, without prejudicing the powers of the Vestry to apportion the expenses of paving such road when the same shall be paved as a new street. Further that the expenses incurred in repairing such streets may in the first instance be paid by the Vestry, but "shall as soon as may be " be apportioned and recovered from the owners of the land, etc., abutting. Sec. 4 provides—That any person making a sewer or branching any drain or sewer in any sewer vested in the Council without their consent, shall be liable to a penalty of £50. Sec. 5 provides—That any person making or branching any drain or sewer into any sewer vested in the Vestry without previously obtaining the approval in writing of the Vestry, or not constructing any such sewer in accordance with the plan and section, or directions of the Vestry, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £50; and further that the Vestry may require the owner to remove such sewer if not properly constructed, and reconstruct same, and if the owner fails to comply with this requirement, he shall be liable to a further penalty of £5 per day, and the Vestry may execute the work and recover the cost. It further provides that if the premises of more than one owner are connected with the sewer, the cost of the work shall be apportioned upon each owner according to the rateable value of the premises. Sec. 6 provides that it shall not be lawful after the passing of this Act to allow any street to be formed over land from which sand, or gravel, or other soil has been excavated, until the sub-soil has been properly levelled and made good with gravel, stone, or other material, to the satisfaction of the Vestry, expressed in writing, or to excavate any sub-soil from any land upon which it is intended to form any street, except upon such conditions as to the making of a proper foundation as the Vestry may in writing impose. This Sec. further provides that any person dissatisfied with such refusal or conditions may, within seven days, appeal to the Council. The penalty for offending against this clause is £5, and 20s. for every day after the first day during which the offence is continued. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1890. I reported on this Act in October, 1890, as follows:— This Act, passed on the 18th August, 1890, provides new powers in reference to several matters, the following of which are of importance to this Vestry:— Bye-laws to control Parks, and power to appoint constables. Secs. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 give the Council power to make Bye-Laws for regulating the control of parks and open spaces, and to appoint constables to enforce the said Bye-Laws. Public bands. Sec. 21 gives the Council power to maintain public bands, and provide music in the parks. Power to provide "morgue." Sec. 22 authorises the Council to provide one or two places to which dead bodies may be removed, with a view to the ultimate identification of such dead bodies. Power to lend money for Mortuary, Sec. 24 extends the powers of the Council to lend money for sanitary purposes under Sec. 183 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, to any expenses incurred by any Vestry in the provision of a mortuary. 193 Power to purchase lands outside improvement area. Sec. 25 provides that the Council may purchase additional lands adjoining any area being dealt with as an improvement scheme, under the Artisans' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875.

This is a Bill of very great importance. I reported on the draft of this Bill, and the following notes from my report refer to the chief points for consideration :— Sub-Sec. 2.—Straw should be only laid with the permission of the "Local Authority," which words should be inserted. Sub-Sec. 3.—It should be made an offence to remove "at any time" offensive material in carts "without proper coverings." Sec. 19 provides that certain trades may not be started at all in London; others, which are named or to be afterwards named by the L.C.C., may not be 194 started without sanction. To the last list saccharine works, distillery and chemical works, japanners, and electro-platers should be added. Several clauses propose to give authority to appeal to the London County Council against notices, etc., of Local Authority. This is a new power sought to be conferred on the Council. Line 82 re Cellar Dwellings.—The minimum height should be 8 ft., and the area of window should, in addition, be proportionate to the area of room, say at least 1/1 6 LONDON COUNCIL OMNIBUS BILL, 1890. I reported on the Bill as one which might help the Vestry in many matters, especially if some of the powers sought were also conferred on the Local Authorities. APPLICATION FOR LOANS.

CONCLUSION. In concluding this report I have again to call the special attention of the members of the Vestry to the following matters already referred to in this and my former reports. 1. The rapid increase of the Parish, which is shown by the census returns, the number of estates that are being laid out, the length of new sewers laid, and the number of new buildings. 2. The economy to be effected with respect to the collection and disposal of dust. This matter is fully reported on in my Report for 1888-9. 3. The advantage to be gained by the Vestry purchasing as many horses as the new stables will accommodate, instead of continually hiring. 198 4. The importance of laying out the 12 acres known as Bishop's Meadow and West Meadow as a Park without further delay, the land having been allowed to remain in its present discreditable condition, with the area being decreased by the action of the River, since the original grant in 1884, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have during the year threatened to reconsider the question of the grant. 5. The importance of the Rights of Lammas over the 77 acres known as Lammas Lands, or of arranging compensation for them. 6. The advisability of the construction of the Cromwell Road Bridge. I have again the pleasure of expressing my entire satisfaction with the Officials in my department, viz., Mr. William P. Jones, the Superintendent of Roads; Mr. F. W. J. Palmer, the Assistant Surveyor; Mr. Charles Botterill, Chief Outdoor Assistant, Mr. J. A. Webb, Clerk of Works, and Mr. D. S. Matthews, junior assistant, and I desire to thank them for their able assistance. I also beg to repeat my thanks to the officials and members of the Vestry for their co-operation, assistance, and courtesy during the year. I remain, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES P. NORRINGTON, Assoc. Mem. Inst., C.E. Member of the Incorporated Association of Engineers, Surveyor to the Vestry. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of the Par ish of Fulham. 1890-91. The Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON. SECOND ANNUAL REPORT of the NEW STREETS SURVEYOR. Being for the Year 1890-91. W. SYKES, New Streets Surveyor. The Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON. New Streets Surveyor's Department, Town Hall, Walham Green, June, 1891. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Second Annual Report on matters connected with my department for the year ending 25th March, 1891. During the year 520 summonses have been issued on 70 Roads for amounts owing; the following of which have been contested:— FULHAM PALACE ROAD, Section I. It was argued by the defendant that the above was not a new street. It was found by evidence that the carriage-way was repaired by the authorities in 1867, and was widened about the year 1868, on the side abutting on the Bishop of London's grounds, and that the road had been widened on the other or eastern side about a year ago by the builders, and that the Vestry had done no repairs to the footway, and that land had been thrown into the roadway to make it 40 feet wide. On these facts it was held that Fulham Palace Road had become a new street, and the defendant liable for the amount claimed. CAROLINE PLACE. Yarious summonses issued in respect of paving the above as a court 20 feet in width. It was argued that it could not become a new street because it was not 40 feet wide [but the magistrate overruled this point], and further that it was not open at both ends. Evidence was given to show that the road was about 20 feet in width ; that it was open at both ends, and on this evidence it was held to be a new street, and orders made accordingly. YARNA ROAD. • It was argued in this case that this road formed part of Messrs. Gibbs and Flew's estate, and that upon the construction of certain resolutions passed by the late District Board in 1884 and 1885, they had taken over and adopted as a public road the whole of Yarna Road. The summons was therefore dismissed. BROOMHOUSE ROAD. It was contended in this case that (1) it was not a new street, (2) that the Vestry having failed to establish their first demand could not make a second apportionment, and (3) that the road was called Broom Lane. It was held that Broomhouse Road had become a new street. That the Vestry, having rescinded the former resolution, could make a second apportionment, and that the proper name of the road was Broomhouse Road, and orders were made accordingly. HURLINGHAM ROAD, Section I. It was contended in this case that Hurlingham Road was an old road, repairable by the Parish, and that in places it was not the full width of 40 ft. 202 Evidence was produced to show that formerly Hurlingham Road was a narrow lane, but that houses had recently been erected and the road made the full width of 40 ft., and that the portion of Hurlingham Road not yet 40 ft. wide did not apply to the part in dispute. It was held that Hurlingham Road, Section I., had become a new street, and that the Vestry were entitled to pave it throughout its whole breadth, and orders were made accordingly. BISCAY ROAD, Section I. In this case a question arose as to the ownership of a wall marked No. 10 on plan, against Mr. Bewsher, who called evidence to prove that the wall was not upon his land. After a very lengthy hearing it was held that Mr. Bewsher was not the owner of houses or land abutting on Biscay Road. The summons was accordingly dismissed. FULHAM PALACE ROAD, Section II. These summonses were issued to recover the estimated expenses of paving the above from Biscay Road to the Parish Boundary. It was proved before the justices that the street being an old highway, repairable by the inhabitants at large, was widened about sixteen years ago by the late Fulham District Board of Works, who at that time laid down the pavement on the same side as the "Rifle" public house, and that ever since the roadway and pavement on that side have been repaired at the expense of the rates. Further that the pavement on the other side of the road was laid down by the late Fulham District Board of Works about nine years ago, and since that time the repairs have been done by the Board at the expense of the rates. The magistrate therefore held, that the Board had exercised their powers conferred upon them by statute, and that following the case of the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell, v Hunt, they could not again put in force their powers to pave the street, and accordingly dismissedthe summons, but without costs. CROWN ROAD, Section I. Crown Road was formerly an old highway, but subsequently became a new street. Evidence was produced to show that the road was widened about ten years ago and that houses had been erected during the last eight years. It was held to be a new street, and orders were made in all the cases. MUNSTER ROAD, Section I. This road is a continuation of Crown Road. Similar evidence was given. It was formerly an old highway, and became a new street by the erection of new houses. Orders were made. WANDSWORTH BRIDGE ROAD, Section Ha. This road was constructed in accordance with the Wandsworth Bridge Act 1864, which declared the road to be a highway, repairable by the Parish. The defendant argued that as such the Vestry were liable for the repair of same; but it was still further argued that a highway repairable by the Parish under certain conditions could become a new street, viz., by the erection of new houses on either side. Evidence was called as to the erection of the houses. It was held to have become a new street, and the Vestry were entitled to pave it under the powers conferred upon them by the Metropolis Local Management Acts, 1855 and 1862 and orders were made accordingly. 203 MARGRAVINE ROAD, Section II. These summonses were issued in respect of paving Margravine Road, Section 2. Mr. W. P. Jones was called to give evidence in support of the summonses, and in cross-examination it was elicited from him that the road had been recently repaired by the Vestry's workmen since apportionment as a new treet. On this evidence the Magistrate held the apportionment bad and lismissed the summons. ROADS ORDERED TO BE PAVED UNDER COMPULSORY POWERS.

COLLECTION OF MONIES. During the past year 520 summonses, representing about £24,572, have been issued to recover the estimated expenses of paving certain roads. I have made about fifty attendances at the Police Court and Kensington Petty Sessions to give evidence in support of these summonses. As a result of this, together with the energetic way in which Mr. Collins has pursued this question, the total sum of about £26,000 has been collected during the past year. Much has been said about the state of the finances of this department, and that we were holding owners' monies and doing no work. We have been bound down by a resolution of the Vestry which provides that no road shall be commenced before 75 per cent. of the estimated cost has been subscribed. Supposing we were collecting in forty roads, and that only 50 per cent. of total cost of these roads had been subscribed, we should by this resolution have been debarred from commencing the making-up of any of these roads, although we might have about £10,000 of the total cost in hand. 206 The resolution stating the 75 per cent. to be collected has been made somewhat inoperative owing to the following resolution by the New Streets Committee of the 4th March, 1891:— "That they call the attention of the Vestry to the fact that, according to "the resolution of the Vestry, it is an instruction to the New Streets "Committee to advertise for tenders for making up roads as soon as 75 per "cent. of the total apportionment is collected, and that the resolution allows "the making up of any street being advertised for whether 75 per cent. of "the apportionment has been collected or otherwise, provided that the "Vestry wish it and resolve accordingly." From this resolution it will be gathered that should any special circumstances favour the making up of any street before the 75 per cent. of the estimated cost has been subscribed, the Vestry may by resolution authorise such street to be made up. The past severe winter has also been very much against us. For a period of nine weeks it was impossible to proceed with any out-door work owing to the frost, but during the whole of this period money was being collected. Our balance at the bank at the commencement of the frost was about £13,000; when it broke up we found ourselves with a balance of £16,000. This sum has been gradually decreasing, until now our balance is only £11,000. It must be admitted that by the resolution of the Vestry it has been impossible to regulate our balance other than has been done. It must be far better that we should have a balance rather than be indebted to the Vestry to the extent of £3,000 or £4,000, as was the case prior to the formation of this department. INCREASE IN PRICES. I regret again to report the very great increase in the cost of materials used in the construction of these roads. 3 in. York stone was formerly laid for 9d. per foot, whereas the price has now increased to 11d. per foot; 12 by 6 kerb, formerly 1s. 7d., now 2s.; hard core could once be obtained for 6d. per load—in fact, a great amount of it was formerly shot free into the roads for the benefit of the shoot; but owing to the great number of roads now being made up in this parish, the supply has been exhausted, and had it not been for the large heap lying at the Gas Works, the whole of the work in this parish would have been suspended for the want of hard core—even contractors have had pickets stationed at the entrances to the main thoroughfares leading out of London directing carmen to Fulham, and the exorbitant prices of 2s. to 2s. 6d. per load have recently been paid for hard core. The labour question has also very much affected the cost of these roads. The position of the labourer is now far better than it was last year. The insertion of the following clause in the specification has also, to some extent, increased the cost:— 207 "The Contractor shall at all times during the continuation of this "Contract pay to the workmen employed on the work the union rate of "wages, and also observe such hours of labour as are generally accepted as "fair in the trade, and shall pay all unskilled workmen or labourers a "minimum wage of sixpence per hour." Formerly a great amount of boy labour was employed on this work, but contractors refuse to give the sixpence per hour, and there is no doubt that formerly even adult labour was paid less than sixpence per hour; and there is also no doubt that, owing to the general strike which has recently been going on, the value of labour in every trade has been increased. Under these circumstances it would be manifestly unfair to compare the cost of roads completed by this department with those done before its formation, although I contend that the figures which might be arrived at, to make this comparison are, in fact, no comparison at all. For instance, a road with several flanks, and also with as many roads leading into it, would appear to cost by the rate per foot considerably more than the same road with no flanks and no entrances into it, although the total cost would be the same. Why ? Because the effective frontage has been reduced by the flanks, etc., and, therefore, the gross rate per foot must be increased. Again, one road may have the whole of the paving, gullies, &c., laid, whereas its neighbour may require all new stone and new gullies; and further, narrow roads cannot, for the purpose of making a comparison, be included amongst the wide ones. Before any satisfactory comparison of the cost per foot of these roads can be made it would be necessary to reduce the whole of the roads to a common standard. This argument can be borne out by a reference to the Table on page 208. Avonmore Road cost 7s. l3/4d. per foot, whereas Dolby Road cost 15s. 0¼d. per foot. There is no other reason why Dolby Road should cost twice as much per foot as Avonmore Road, excepting that Avonmore Road is a long road; nearly the whole of the paving and gullies existed, and the reduction of the frontage by flanks was very small, whereas Dolby Road is a short road, it required all new paving and gullies, and the reduction of the frontage by flanks was great. Then, referring to the Table prepared by Mr. Norrington, printed in last year's Report, there is no reason why Cross Road should cost 7s. 5d. per foot, and Portland Place 15s. l3/4d., excepting for the fact of Cross Road being only half the width of Portland Place. ROADS COMPLETED. The following 22 roads have been completed during the past year at a total cost of £9,948 10s. 3d., representing a nett average cost of 10s. 1d. per foot of their effective frontages. But it will be seen from my remarks elsewhere that I do not regard this as in any way comparative:— 208 ROADS COMPLETED. From March 25th, 1890, to March 5th, 1891. Date of Commencement.

I reported as follows to the New Streets Committee on the question of the construction of Gullies:— New Streets Surveyor's Department, Vestry Hall, Walham Green, S.W. 3rd July, 1890. To the Chairman and Members of the New Streets Committee. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, "I beg to recommend that this Committee should take into consideration "the question of the construction of gullies used in new streets. The "present specification provides for their construction with 9-in. brickwork. "I consider that gullies constructed of brickwork are a source of danger to "the public, as it is impossible to build them so as to keep watertight for "any length of time (when constructed in accordance with this specifica"tion). By the water leaking away the gulley will become unsealed, and "will then be simply acting as a ventilator to the main sewer. "It is also difficult to fix a swan's neck in a brick gulley properly. "Should they drop while being built in, and not sufficient 'lip' given, the "gulley will not be water-sealed, but act as a ventilator to the sewer. "I have brought up a design for a gulley that I should recommend in "future to be adopted. It is stoneware, bedded in 6 in. of concrete. "There is no likelihood of this gulley ever leaking, as there are no joints "in it, being made in one piece; the swan's neck is also made attached to "the gulley, and when once fixed there can be no fear of it ever becoming "untrapped. 210 "I consider that if these gullies were adopted it would prevent a serious "nuisance, by cutting off" a volume of sewer gas which would otherwise "escape from gullies constructed of brickwork." After having considered the question, the Vestry decided by resolution on the 9th July, 1890—"That in future stoneware gullies be used in lieu of brickwork in all new streets, in accordance with the plan prepared by the New Streets Surveyor."

On the 19th June, 1890, I presented the following Report on the above matter:— New Streets Surveyor's Department, Vestry Hall, Walham Green, 19th June, 1890. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, In accordance with the instructions contained in the following Resolution, I beg to submit herewith my report thereon:— "That the New Streets Surveyor be instructed to make a report to the "Vestry on the advisability of the Vestry making up all New Streets with "their own workmen." The present method of dealing with this work is to submit it to public competition. The persons tendering are invariably those living in the immediate neighbourhood, and in almost every case the lowest tender is accepted. There are 150 of these roads now ordered to be constructed in Fulham, and assuming them to cost £500 each, this involves an outlay of £75,000. Fulham is at present only about two-thirds built over—there being about 615 acres of land eligible for building purposes ; and I am informed that a great portion of this land will shortly be built upon. To develop the whole of this land would necessitate the formation of at least 350 New Streets. From these facts it will be seen that the subject of the resolution is worth very careful consideration, inasmuch as there will be about 500 New Streets to construct, involving an outlay of—say—a quarter of a million pounds sterling. I have not had any special points submitted to me to report on, other than the advisability of the Vestry doing this work with their own workmen. I will, therefore, consider (1) Whether the present method is more costly than the one suggested ? (2) Would the work if dealt with by the Vestry be any better in construction ? There is no doubt that the first point, viz.—whether the present method is more costly than the one suggested—is one that the resolution may have implied, and is the one which in my mind ought to suggest itself to the Vestry sooner than any other point, in favour of carrying out this work with their own workmen. If this work can be dealt with more economically and as effectually, it will not only benefit the owners of houses and land abutting upon these New Streets, but will, in an indirect form, benefit the parish. There is no possibility of carrying out this work at less cost, unless the profits obtained by the contractors can be put in the pockets of the persons who are called upon to pay for the construction of these streets. The question has yet to be solved whether the Vestry can deal with this work as economically as a contractor; and, for the sake of argument, I will assume that the nett profits of a contractor would be 5 per cent. on this class of work; 212 but the Vestry could not reckon on such a profit as this, as in the case of a contractor he is at liberty to tender for works in all parts, and so have his men and plant going all the year, whereas the Yestry would be confined to this special work; and there may be times when we shall not have a single street in hand, and in that case our plant and staff would be idle. To start this work would involve an outlay of £1,000 in plant. Assuming that the Yestry might earn 3 per cent. on the outlay, and that they could borrow this sum of £1,000, with repayment spread over a period of five years, and assuming 30 streets per annum to be made up, at £500 £15,000 0 0 3 per cent. on which sum equal profits 450 0 0 Deduct repayment of principal and interest on loan of £1,000, at 5 per cent. per annum 230 0 0 Nett profits per annum £220 0 0 Even supposing that this sum were earned, it would, when spread over the various owners in these thirty streets, be so small as to be scarcely perceptible. I have so far taken the best view of this matter, but it is a difficult task indeed to estimate upon a matter which after all is one of speculation. If this work could be dealt with in a more economical manner, there is 110 doubt that itwould be an incentive to builders to come into the parish to open up the 615 acres of vacant land; but, on the other hand, if the Yestry were to fail in their attempt, and caused these streets to become more costly, there is no doubt that it would prevent that rapid development which would otherwise take place. I have been unable to obtain any information which would guide me as to the comparative cost of work done by public tender and that dealt with privately as I know of no parish or public body that deals with such work other than by public tender. I think that it is only reasonable that contracts submitted to competition can be dealt with in a far more economical manner than those dealt with in any other form, and from the following figures it will be seen that the Vestry have admitted that they cannot deal with this work as economically as though it were submitted to competition. Mr. Norrington's. estimate for sixty roads was £35,340, whereas the actual cost of these roads was only £25,003, being £10,337 less than the estimate. It will therefore be seen that the estimate for these roads was 41 per cent. higher than the actual cost. These figures prove that at that time the Vestry could not deal with this work as economically as though it were done by public tender. With respect to the second point:—"Would the work, if dealt with by the Yestry, be any better in construction ?" This is a point of great importance to the ratepayers, inasmuch as these streets, after having been taken over under compulsory powers, have ever after to be maintained out of the General Rate. It is an admitted fact that the cheapest constructed roads are in fact the dearest, and vice versd, for when a road has been badly constructed the 213 tenance of that road will cost double the maintenance of a well constructed road. To make this point more clear, take a road that has been scamped in construction, where in parts a strict eye has been kept and may have been well constructed, in other parts the construction may be defective, with little foundation, which would soon sink and cause depression in the surface, and by the continual bumping of the carts out of these depressions others would be formed, and the road would soon be full of holes. The maintenance of such roads as these would be a heavy burden on the ratepayers for ever. If such were the state of things and that roads were constructed in this form, then that would be a great point in favour of this work being done by the Vestry's own workmen. I am happy to say that such does not exist, for I contend that if the Vestry were to do this work themselves no better workmanship could be applied. I am therefore of opinion upon this point that no advantage would be derived by departing from the existing principle. It might be imagined that by the Vestry expending such a large sum of money in dealing with this work with their own workmen, the labour trade of Fulham might be very much benefited. It is, however, a fact that the men who engage in this class of work do not live in Fulham. They are a class of men that travel to all parts of the country where these works are being carried out, and the fact of their coming here to work for the Vestry would only amount to the same as a contractor bringing them here to work. The only thing in this way that would benefit the parish has, I think, been done, that is, where in former times paving known as quarry squared was used, it is now squared in Fulham instead of Yorkshire. Contractors have found that, owing to the great quantity of stone condemned, they now get the stone rough and square it on the ground. I therefore think that the labour market of Fulham would not be benefited in the least by the Yestry dealing with this work. If the Vestry should decide to do this work themselves, there would have to be considerable additions to the staff, as it would necessitate opening an entire set of books, with timekeepers and persons to measure the materials and check invoices, at least four permanent gangers would have to be engaged, and during the time the Vestry are doing no work (as such times may occur), both plant and staff would remain idle. I have not attempted to deal with this matter upon the assumption that the Vestry were immediately going to deal with this work; that would have to be in a subsequent report. I have only endeavoured to bring such facts before them as would suggest the advisability of dealing with this matter. In conclusion, I am of opinion that this is a question of such importance that the voice of the Vestry should be taken, and that I ought not to advise upon a matter which is practically an innovation, and which in my mind is one of pure speculation. I have the honour to be, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, W. SYKES. 214 YORK V. ARTIFICIAL STONE. On the 10th December, 1890, I was instructed to report on the above matter and on 15th January I presented the following report on their respective merit as paving for footways:— New Streets Surveyor's Department, Town Hall, Walham Green, S.W. 15th January, 1891. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, In accordance with your instructions of the 10th December, 1890, with reference to the use of Artificial Stones in lieu of York, I beg to present the following report thereon:— The circumstances which have led the Committee to consider this question have doubtless been to see how far economy and durability is consistent with the use of Artificial Stone as compared with that of York. I regret to say that the increase in the cost of materials and labour during the last twelve months have of necessity caused me to increase the cost per foot frontage for the paving of these streets, which no doubt does operate with great hardship upon the owners of property abutting thereon. I have no hesitation in saying that the Yestry adopts the best and most durable materials in making up these streets, and having regard to the fact, that after having been paved under compulsory powers, they have to be maintained in perpetuity out of the pockets of the Ratepayers, I cannot recommend any alteration in the material to be used, which at the outset may appear cheaper, but which ultimately may give results inferior to the material which is now in use. The materials generally accepted for paving footways may be classed under three heads, Firstly.—York Paving. Secondly.—Artificial Stone. Thirdly.—Paving laid in situ. YORK STONE. York Stone, as a material for paving footways, has the advantage of having been used almost exclusively as a paving material prior to the introduction of Artificial Stone, and during which time gained such favour as a material so particularly adapted for this purpose, that Parochial and Corporate bodies have been very wary to discard it in preference to Artificial Stone, or stone of which they have had little practical experience. The present time is a most advantageous one for Fulham to consider this matter, for we shall have the benefit of the experience of parishes who have been more adventurous than we have, in adopting this stone some eighteen to twenty years ago. York Stone is a sand-stone, composed chiefly of silica, which is almost and imperishable substance, cemented together by a matrix of lime, clay, or other material, and its durability depends on the nature of the matrix which binds these grains into one solid mass. There are two classes of York Stone, viz., the thick and thin lifts, or self-bedded and riving stone; the former, which is a laminated stone, is divided by thin layers of mica, and is easily riven into slabs, which are known as self-faced slabs. 215 The riving stone, which is a harder and more durable stone, is brought to the surface in larger blocks and riven with wedges into slabs, dressed on the surface, ?quared, and sold as tooled slabs. The operation is far more difficult than with the thin lift stones; it will often split in irreglar lines, and cause the stones to the either hollow or rounding. It is a frequent occurrence to find such stones when laid, ¼ in. higher than their neighbours, causing a most unsatisfactory and sometimes dangerous footway. One of the greatest disadvantages 6f York Stone as a paving material is its ?nequal temper, or, in other words, to find stones of the same degree of hardness, and when laid it will often be noticed that certain stones will wear more rapidly than others, causing the surface to present an uneven appearance, and forming receptacle for pools of water. One of the best practical tests for the quality and hardness of York Stone is the rough way in which it has been tooled. A chisel will hardly touch some of the hardest stones, and soft ones are often dressed quite smooth and regular. Owing to the hardness of some of the York Stone, the indentations in its surface are often not thoroughly tooled out, and consequently stones are often went out full of holes, and, owing to these defects, some of the best and most Vurable stones are often condemned. The absorptive properties of York Stone are very much greater than those of Artificial Stone: no less than 120 cubic feet, or 750 gallons, or 7,812 lb. of water would be absorbed by the York Stone in a street of average length. It is ?alpable that this must either percolate through and cause the areas adjoining to be very damp, or to remain charged in the stone, causing it to continue in a very damp and unhealthy state until it has been given off in the form of vapour by changes in temperature. One of the most important duties that devolves upon a public body is to carry out such measures as will improve the health of their district, and there than be no doubt that proper drainage of the subsoil, and the making up of ?oads with non-absorbent materials, and laid out at such falls as will cause the surface water to drain away in the least possible time, has had something to do with the satisfactory state of health in a great number of the districts in and around London. Artificial Stones when laid in position are practically non-absorbent, owing to their surfaces having been subjected to a bath—in the case of Victoria stone of a solution of soluble silica, and in the case of Imperial stone of a solution of silicate of soda, which has a great affinity for the materials of which the stone ?s composed, and which, by induration, causes the surface to become so hard and compact that it is almost non-absorbent. Owing to the great absorptive powers of York Stone, it has a tendency to aminate under severe frost by the expansion of the moisture becoming frozen, causing the stone to disintegrate. The average life of York Stone has been estimated at twenty years, but the wear would be directly as the traffic it receives. In 1883, Mr. Lovegrove, the Surveyor of Hackney, reported " that flags laid in 1857 had worn from 1½ inches to 17/8 inches by 1883, giving an average wear of 11/1 1/6 of an inch in twenty-six years." In the Strand some Yorkshire flags laid in 1861 were worn out in 1884.* *Bulnois on Footpaths, lxxxv., Transactions, Inst. Civ. Engineers. 216 The crushing weight in pounds per cubic inch of York Stone, as compared with Victoria, Croft, and Imperial, is as follows: lb. per cubic inch. Imperial 9,492 Croft 9,394 Victoria 8,321 York 5,714 It will therefore be seen that York Stone is very much softer and more liable to wear than Artificial Stone. Although I have pointed out some of the defects of York Stone, there is certainly one important point in its favour, which is its great frictional resistance, or its resistance to sliding, which in my opinion is far greater than that of Artificial Stone. There can be nothing more objectionable, or tiring to the body, than to walk on a pavement where every muscle is taxed, and every sinew is brought into a state of tension for fear of sliding down. ARTIFICIAL STONE. The present is not only a most advantageous time to consider the question of adopting Artificial Stone, from the fact that we have evidence of its wear and durability, but it is equally advantageous when we consider that no less than forty miles of footways, or 1,200,000 superficial feet of paving, will have to be laid within the next three or four years, and, as I have stated in a former report, that to develop the whole of the building land in Fulham would necessitate the construction of 350 new streets, the above figures would be increased to 107 miles of footways, or 3,300,000 superficial feet of paving. It will therefore be seen from the magnitude of these figures that the question as to how far economy and durability is consistent with the use of Artificial Stone as compared "with York, becomes one of great importance. The outlay in paving the footways of 200 streets with York would be £49,999, and with Artificial Stones, £39,999, or a saving of £10,000, or 20 per cent. cheaper than York Stone; this would also reduce the cost by 1s. per foot frontage. The question now resolves itself into two points: Firstly. How far this saving will affect Fulham ? Secondly. Would the advantages to the owners interested outweigh the consequent reduction of the labour market of Fulham ? Upon the first point, I have taken twelve roads of various lengths, and ascertained to what percentage persons residing in Fulham, as compared with the whole, contribute to the cost of making up these roads. I find the total cost of these twelve roads amounts to £10,904, of which £7,776 is contributed outside the parish, and £3,128 inside the parish, or showing that 72 per cent. of the cost of making up New Streets is contributed by persons living out of Fulham. This also shows that the saving to be effected by the use of Artificial Stones to resident owners of property in Fulham, would only be to the extent of about £2,800. I think the advantages to the owners would not outweigh the consequent reduction of the labour market: for whereas York Stone is squared and laid by Fulham men, Artificial Stone needs no squaring, and would be laid by the Companies' own workmen; it will therefore be seen, that from an economical 217 point of view very little advantage would be derived to Fulham; that is, of course, assuming that Artificial Stone is not more durable than York; but to assist you in arriving at this point, I wish to lay the following observations before you. Artificial Stones are composed chiefly of granite and Portland cement, mixed together in the form of concrete, and placed into moulds until set. Granite is a very hard and durable material, and will resist abrasion about three times as well as the hardest sandstones, and when cemented together with a matrix of Portland cement it presents a very hard and homogeneous mass. The quality of the cement is an important point in the manufacture of these stones, and under certain conditions may be such as to cause very serious results. The process of manufacturing cement is as follows: Clay and chalk are mixed together and ground in a pug mill, burnt to a clinker, and finally ground as cement. Cement used immediately after grinding is very dangerous, being hot and subject to expand considerably. For instance, new cement when spread and subjected to a process of aeration will increase in bulk at least 5 per cent. If stones are manufactured with such cement, they will blow and crack; experience has also proved that cement increases in strength with age, and therefore, stone manufactured with it will also increase in the same ratio, and again, Dykerhoff has shown* that slow setting cement had an average expansive power of .0734 per cent., and quick setting .2019 per cent. over a period of twelve months. From these observations it will be seen that this stone will not only increase in bulk, but also in strength with age; it would, therefore, be necessary to obtain the very oldest stones in stock. I do not adduce the above arguments against this stone, for I contend that both the aggregate and the matrix of Artificial Stones are far harder and more durable than those of York Stone. I merely make this observation to show how necessary it will be to subject these stones to such tests as to satisfy ourselves as to their quality, and further to point out that if a firm were very busy, and that stones were sent out immediately after their manufacture, the results might be serious. Artificial Stones have now been used by almost every Yestry and District Board in the Metropolis, and, from testimonials, it would appear that they have given every satisfaction. A portion of Victoria Stone was laid in Piccadilly, in 1872, and is said to be in good condition still, having been laid 19 years. In 1869, the approach to Blackfriars Bridge was paved with Victoria Stone, and 6 years later, Mr. Carr, the Engineer, said the surface was perfect, and the wear decidedly less than the York Stone contiguous. This stone has also been laid in Holborn, where the traffic is estimated at 88,355 daily, and Aldgate High Street, where the traffic is estimated at 79,048 daily. Portions of the stone were taken up after 5 years, and the wear was found to be so slight as to be scarcely measurable. Imperial Stone has also been largely used throughout the metropolis, and appears to have given every satisfaction. There are many other good stones in the market, of which I append a list, showing their cost, tensile and compressive strains, &c., as given by the respective firms. * Strachan on Footpaths, Congress of Municipal and Sanitary Engineers, Leicester. 218  Cost per square yard delivered in Fulham, Cost per yard laid.

It is of a uniform temper and homogeneous throughout, and consequently its wear will be uniform. It increases in toughness with age, it forms a very even and regular footway, it is clean and cheerful, almost non-absorbent, and consequently dries quicker than York Stone. The stones are made of uniform size and therefore present a regular appearance; it has been said that in wet weather it is very slippery, but I am of opinion that it is far more slippery in dry weather, especially when we consider that leather has a great adhesive power on wet stone. The following tests were made to find the comparative wear of the following stones, which were of equal superficial area, all bound together with cord so that each stone found its own bed when rubbed on York stone with sand and water:— York. Imperial. Victoria. Croft. Thickness beforebeing rubbed 2¼ 2 9/48 2 3/48 2 1/48 First hour 2 3/24 2 4/24 2 1/24 2 1/48 Second hour 2 3/48 2 7/48 2 1/48 2 Third hour 2 1/48 2 6/48 2 1 23/24 Total wear in three hours 11/48 3/48 3/48 3/48 Stuart's Granolithic and Jones' Annealed received too late for testing. From these figures it will be seen that the total wear in the three hours was for York 11/48 of an inch, Imperial 3/48 Victoria 3/48 Croft 3/48. This experiment is interesting as showing that the wear of York was 1/8 in. more than that of Artificial Stone, also that the Imperial, Victoria, and Croft wore equally, and would therefore be of the same degree of hardness. 219 IN SITU PAVING. In Situ Paving has the advantage of being far cheaper than slabs, and will give almost as good results; but, as I have already stated, there is a liability for it to crack by expansion, more especially if the cement be new ; but when the materials be good and well laid, it forms an even and cheerful paving. Being laid in large blocks it will not settle, leaving one stone above another, as is often the case with slabs. I could not recommend the adoption of In Situ Pavement in a growing neighbourhood like Fulham, and where, owing to building operations, the Gas and Water Companies are almost daily disturbing the pavement. CONCLUSIONS. The principal conclusions arrived at in this report may be classed as follows:— 1st. That York Stone is more absorbent than Artificial Stone. 2nd. That in consequence it may be more dangerous to health. 3rd. In my opinion the life of York Stone would not be so great as Artificial. 4th. That Artificial Stone is far more slippery than York Stone. 5th. From an economical point of view, so far as the resident owners of property in Fulham are concerned, the advantages of using Artificial Stone would not warrant its adoption. 6th. If Artificial Stone is manufactured from inferior cement, serious results will follow. 7th. Artificial Stone is 20 per cent. cheaper than York Stone. 8th. Artificial Stone wears far more regularly than York Stone. In conclusion, 1 may say I have endeavoured to treat the whole question as one of York v. Artificial Stones, and so far the conclusions at which I have arrived seem to favour Artificial Stones; but there is one point upon which I cannot satisfy myself, and which I must leave to the Committee to decide; that is, whether the defects of York Stone would not outweigh the slipperiness of Artificial Stone. Should you decide this point in favour of the Artificial Stone, the question would arise as to which stone should be used; at present I am not in a position to say. I think a Committee might with advantage view the various pavements laid in London, and decide this point themselves. I have the honour to be, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, W. SYKES. 220 Arising out of this report it was decided in the future to advertise for tenders for Imperial, Victoria, and York Stone. The Victoria and Imperial Stone Companies being manufacturers of stone only, would not engage to do the part of Road making, Gullies, Crossings, etc.; therefore to admit of their tendering it was necessary to split the contract. (1) Roadmaking, etc. (2) Paving. This necessitated the making of fresh specifications, contracts, etc., but the difficulty of having two contractors in the same road has given rise to a lot of trouble and divided responsibility, besides keeping the work in hand longer than would be the case if one contractor were to do the whole. Seeing that great difficulties would arise by this system, I reported as follows to the New Streets Committee:— "New Streets Surveyor's Department, "Vestry Hall, Walham Green, "26th March, 1891. 'To the Chairman and Members of the New Streets Committee. "Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen,— "I beg to suggest to the Committee the advisability of including both "Paving of Footways and Roadway in one specification. The principle of "separating them has already caused great delay in getting the footway "contract signed, thereby delaying the roadway. I do not feel disposed to "give the order to commence one contract until at least the other contract "is signed. Moreover, instead of the system of dividing the contracts "proving more economical, so far, I think, it has been more costly, and I "am of opinion that Road Contractors, knowing that they will not get the "footway contracts, have increased their prices for the roadway, and as "many times as the contract is split up there will be so many items for "lighting, watching, and contingencies, whereas one would otherwise do." The Committee having considered this report, decided to continue with two contracts for the present. I have the honour to be, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. SYKES.
