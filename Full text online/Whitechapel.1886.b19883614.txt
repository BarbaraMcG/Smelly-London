WHI 34 THE ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION, &c., &c., of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, (WITH VITAL STATISTICS:) FOR THE YEAR 188 6, by JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Surgeon to the London Sailor's Home, &c. london: printed by penny and hull, leman street, e. 1887. Office of the Board of Works, Whitechapel District, No. 15, Great Alie Street, Whitechapel, E., February 21st, 1887. Gentlemen, In the Registrar-General's Annual Report for 1885, which has recently been received, I notice several curious and important observations to which I propose briefly to allude as a fitting sequel to my last report, before commencing that for the year 1886. Referring to marriages, the Registrar-General quotes an oftrepeated theory—that marriages increase as the price of food diminishes., and he then proceeds to prove the fallacy of this doctrine by statistics extending over a period of twenty-five years. A suggestion is thrown out that the marriage-rate fluatuates with the exports of British goods, rather than with the cheapness of food, depending in reality upon the amount of wages received. Some very curious figures are produced, showing the mean age at marriage amongst various classes and persons ; thus, whilst miners marry at 23½ years of age, and labourers at 25, commercial clerks do not increase their responsibility in this respect until a year later, and professional men wait until they are almost 3I before venturing upon matrimony. The last information which I extract upon this subject, indicates the enormous advance in education amongst marrying people, as, during the year, 11-8 per cent. of the newly-married were unable to sign the register, whilst in 1870 double that number, and in 1855 treble that number, were illiterates. The birth-rate during 1885, was the lowest recorded since 1848, and was equal to 32-5 per 1,000 for the United Kingdom. With a single exception, the rate has fallen continuously, year by year, since 1876. 4 The death-rate, again, was remarkably low (19.0 per 1,000), and with the exception of the year 1881, when it was 18.9, it was the lowest recorded death-rate. In some interesting paragraphs on statistics of deaths from hydrophobia, it is recorded that 60 deaths were registered from that disease in 1885, against 61 and 79 respectively in the years 1874 and 1877, which are the highest numbers recorded ; and in order to allay alarm on this subject, Sir Brydges Henniker states the important fact, "that the indisputable amount of apprehension as regards this disease is quite disproportionate to the risk of its occurrence. The risk of death from murder or homicide is many times as great as the risk of death from hydrophobia." REPORT. HE first step towards the compilation of my third annual report will be an endeavour to arrive at as correct an estimate of our population as circumstances will permit. I have before explained how manifold are the causes which operate in varying the number of people in different parts of the District at different times, and I have alluded, somewhat in detail, elsewhere to the part registered lodging-houses play in this particular. I will now explain that by taking the mean birth-rate of the two last census years—and calculating our population for 1886 upon that basis, I find that we should have 72,142 persons in the Whitechapel District. In support of the probable correctness of such calculation, I may mention that in 1871, when the District contained 76,573 persons, " The Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Acts" had not come into operation. Since that time, I find that there have been dislodged from their residences by various agencies, 11,859 persons, as follows: — From the Royal Mint-street area ... ... 3750 ,, Flower and Dean-street area ... ... 2277 ,, Goulston-street area ... ... ... 2757 By the East London Railway Improvements... 56 ,, Met. and District Railway ditto ... 380 ,, London, Tilbury and Southend ditto... 2579 ,, Other alterations in the District ... 60 Total ... 11,859 On the other hand, various model and other dwellings have been eretfted, which at present accommodate 6,423 persons, thus, should no other changes have taken place, our population would be 71,137. Apart, however, from the natural increase of births over deaths, we are aware that many persons who were dislodged from the areas I have named, took advantage of rooms which were offered in the immediate neighbourhood of their former homes, and thus many houses which were previously occupied by only a few 6 people, have become converted into tenement dwellings. Again, whilst migration has been constant in our midst, there can be little doubt as to the preponderance of immigration over emigration, and, although we cannot flatter ourselves that thereby we are benefited qualitatively, there is a considerable and growing gain to the District in numbers at least. Thus it is fair to assume that the above calculation does not, at any rate, overstate our population. Upon this basis, it follows also, that the population of each SubDistrict is as follows:— The Spitalfields Sub-District 22,057 The Mile End New Town ditto 19,914 The Whitechapel Church ditto. 18,000 The Goodman's-fields ditto 6,657 Aldgate ditto 5,514 Total 72,142 During the year 1886 (consisting of 52 weeks), which ended on Saturday, January 1st, 1887, there were registered in the five registration Sub-Districts a total of 2,531 births and 2,257 deaths. Tables A and B* of the appendix illustrate these particulars in detail. It is necessary,to be accurate in dealing with these figures, to adopt the system which I have hitherto practised, and, therefore, as regards the births, I have availed myself of the kindly co-operation of Dr. Whitfield (Acting Medical Superintendent to the Whitechapel Union Infirmary), to obtain the previous addresses of the mothers who were delivered in that Institution. These I have distributed correctly amongst the several SubDistricts, as set out in Table C†, from which it appears that the total births in the District, and properly belonging to it, were 2,525, of which 1,267 were males, and 1,258 were females. In dealing with the 2,257 deaths registered in the District, I notice that in our public institutions, and also in other parts of the District, there died 725 persons who were not properly belonging to the District—6 were registered in the Aldgate Sub-District, 7 in the Mile End New Town Sub-District, and 712 in the Whitechapel Church Sub-District, wherein is situated the London Hospital. Not one took place in either the Spitalfields or the Goodman'sfields Sub-Districts. We have next to consider that in public institutions outside the District (as particularized in Table E)‡, * Page 26. † Page 26. ‡ Page 27. 7 there died 92 persons who belonged to the District, and whose former residences I have obtained from the Registrar-General's Office by special arrangement. I am thus in a position to compile a correct District Mortality Table (Table D*), which indicates that 856 males, and 768 females, or a total of 1,624 persons, belonging to our District died during the year, distributed amongst the registration Sub-Districts as follows:—the Spitalfields, 560 ; the Mile End New Town, 339; the Whitechapel Church, 428; the Goodman's-fields, 170 ; and the Algate, 127. Compared with the preceding year, there is a total increase of 168 deaths, disposed amongst the Sub-Districts as follows ; In the Spitalfields, an increase of 33 ; in the Mile End New Town, an increase of 49 ; in the Whitechapel Church, an increase of 87 ; in the Goodman's-fields, a decrease of five ; and in the Aldgate, an increase of 4. In the two latter the population has remained almost stationary, whilst in the three former the rate of increase in inhabitants has probably been proportionate to the increase in the number of deaths. The natural increase of births over deaths is 901, against 917 for 1885, and 929 for 1884. Allowance being made for the relative difference in the populations, our natural increase is almost identical with that for the whole of the Metropolis. I have calculated the Distriift death-rate at 22-51 per 1000 for the year, but as this rate is influenced greatly by the number of common lodging-houses in the District, I would invite your attention to my remarks upon this subject before you criticise it severely as a phenomenal high death-rate. We will now proceed to examine into these 1624 District deaths. In Table F†, will be found the ages at death of those who died during the year, from which I extracft the following calculation:— 26-7%of the total deaths occurred under the age of 1 year 17.7 ,, „ ,, betwen the ages of 1 and 5 3.4 ,, ,, ,, ,, 5 and 20 12.6 ,, ,, ,, ,, 20 and 40 19.5 „ ,, ,, ,, 40 and 60 19.8 ,, ,, ,, over the age of 60 2.9 ,, ,, ,, ,, 80 * Page 27. † Page 28. 8 Forty-eight persons lived to above the age of 80 years, and 4 of these reached to above 90, of whom 3 were women. They were registered in the Sub-Districts as follows In the Spitalfields, 13 ; in the Mile End New Town, 11 ; in the Whitechapel Church, 17 ; and in the Goodman's-fields, 7. The registered cause of death in the case of these aged people was, in 23, old age; in 20, chest disease; in 4, nervous disease ; and in 1, accident. During the year, 17 deaths were registered as "uncertified," and although no medical certificates were received in any of these Uncertified cases, they were individually considered by the Coroner, and by that officer the Registrars were Deaths. . instructed to register the deaths, and they were accordingly so registered as follows : — In the Spitalfields Sub-District 6 „ Mile End New Town ditto 3 „ Whitechapel Church ditto 4 ,, Goodman's-fields ditto 2 ,, Aldgate ditto 2 Ten were males, and 7 were females; 10 were under one year old, 4 were between 40 and 60, 2 were between 60 and 80, and 1 was over 80 years of age ; 9 were recorded as having died from convulsions, premature birth, or exhaustion; 3 from respiratory diseases; 1 from apoplexy; 2 from senile decay; and 2 from natural causes. Midwives certified in 6 of the cases. In the London Hospital, there died during the year 849 persons, 139 of whom were residents. Over 60 per cent. of the residents who died away from home, selected the District Public London Hospital for treatment, the remaining, Institutions. nearly 40 per cent., preferring the public institutions in other parts of the Metropolis, as particularized in Table E* of the appendix. In the Whitechapel Union Infirmary, there died during the year 323 persons, only 7 of whom were non-residents ; thus 316 residents died in the Infirmary, against 292 recorded in 1885. The District medical officers received a total of 3,501 new orders for attendance upon patients, either at the Dispensary in Thomas-st., or at the patients' homes, and 2,038 were immediately * See Page 27. 9 transferred either into the Infirmary, or into some special hospital. For particulars of the diseases for which these persons were attended, see Table G of the appendix, on page 29. It will be noticed that 67 in excess of 1885 remained to be attended by the District medical officers. If, therefore, the pauper illness be an index to the general sickness in the District, allowing for increase of population, the sickness rate for the year may be regarded as satisfactory. A reference to Table H, page 30,will indicate the precise cause of death of each of the 1,624 persons who died during the year. It shows that from the whole zymotic class of diseases 235 persons died, or 14.47 per cent. of the total deaths in the District, whilst for the whole Metropolis, the deaths were equal to 15.27 per cent. from this class of diseases. I have thought it worth while to carry out this method of comparison throughout the various classes of diseases, as follows : — Class of Disease. Percentage of Deaths to Total Deaths. London includ'g Whitcchapel Whitechapel.

In the subjoined Table will be seen, separately contrasted, the zymotic diseases, showing the percentage of each to total deaths : Diseases. London. Whitechapel. Small-Pox 0.006 0.0 Measles 2.526 2.832 Scarlet Fever 0.835 1.354 Typhus 0.015 0.061 Relapsing Fever 0.0001 0.0 Influenza 0.0006 0.0 Whooping-Cough 3.446 2.770 Diphtheria 1.028 0.980 Simple Fever 0.085 0.061 Enteric Fever 0.752 0.677 Simple Cholera 0.166 0.061 Diarrhoea 4.801 4.002 Remittent Fever 0.0002 0.0 Other Zymotic Diseases 1.579 1.662 It has hitherto only been the custom in this District to disinfect bedding, rooms, &c., where cases of small-pox, scarlet-fever, typhus, or enteric fever, and such-like diseases have occurred, but, in view of the fact that measles and whooping-cough add so largely to our mortality returns, I am not certain that wisdom would not be exercised by carrying out the same procedure in these diseases. I have in fact, during the year, placed deaths from measles upon the list when other young children are found to be resident where deaths take place from that disease. The absence of small-pox from the list of deaths will be noticed with satisfaction, and I have again to mention the highly gratifying position which the District vaccination statistics occupy in the last Local Government Report. The Table I append (Table L, page 32), which shows the result of Mr. Sherman's work in this respect, bears out the commendation conveycd in the report to which 1 have adverted. This seems to be a suitable 11 place wherein to interpolate a table indicative of a return from the Metropolitan Asylums' Board, from which I have compiled a comparative statement of certain diseases admitted into that Board's Institutions from the Metropolis during the year.

Table J is constructed to enable a comparison to be readily instituted for deaths from any special disease between the Metropolis as a whole and the Whitechapel District, and for this purpose the deaths are also set out in the tables applicable to the District in a similar manner, therefore, there is no necessity to amplify this part of my report by referring to each disease separately. It is customary for sanitary reporters to devote considerable attention to the statistics connected with the infant mortality returns, considering that an index is thereby obtained to the general condition of health of the whole community. I have, therefore, to add to those items concerning the percentage of deaths between certain age-periods, which I have already given, by the in troduction of a few special details, applicable to the deaths of 12 infants and children under the age of five years, for the whole Metropolis, as well as for the Whitechapel district:— The deaths of infants, under the age of one year, in London, equalled 25.8 per cent. of the total deaths, and 15.1 per cent. of the registered births ; whilst in the Whitechapel district, those infants who died under the age of one year equalled 26.7 per cent. of the total deaths, and 17.2 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were, for London, equal to 41.7 per cent. of the total deaths, and 25.6 per cent. of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel district they were equal to 44.5 per cent. of the total deaths, and 28.6 per cent. of the registered births. During the year, 22 persons (10 males and 12 females) died at the various asylums, as follows :—At Banstead, 9 ; Colney Hatch, 9 ; Carne Hill, 1 ; Leavesden, 2 ; and Hanwell, 1. Extra The registered causes of death were:—Old age, Metropolitan 4; nervous diseases, 14; constitutional diseases, Deaths. 2; and heart disease, 2. Two females died at Banstead from senile decay, aged respectively 91 and 81 ; the ages of the remainder were—between 20 and 40 years, 7; between 40 and 60, 7 ; and between 60 and 80, 6. Violent Deaths.—Fifty-four deaths (34 males and 20 females) from violence were recorded during the year, belonging to the several Sub-Districts, as follows:— The Spitalfields Sub-District, 13—males 4 ; females, 9. The Mile End New Town ,, 10— ,, 8; ,, 2. The Whitechapel Church ,, 22— ,, 14; ,, 8. The Goodman's Fields ,, 2— ,, 2; ,, nil. The Aldgate ,, 7— „ 6; ,, 1. Fourteen died under the age of 1 year; 10 between the ages of 1 and 5 ; 6 between 5 and 20; 10 between 20 and 40 ; 9 between 40 and 60 ; 4 between 60 and 80; and 1 over the age of 80. The cause of death in each case was investigated by the coroner, and registered as follows : — Suffocated in bed, infants (males 6, females 5) 11 Burns, scalds, and suffocation by smoke 7 Drowning 2 Run over 9 13 Falls or accidental blows— Head 12 Spine 2 Arm 1 Thigh 2 Ribs. 1 Operation (chloroform asphyxia) 1 Suicide— Poison 2 Cutthroat 2 Jump from window. 1 Narcotic poisoning (how administered not known) 1 A total of 288 inquests were held in the District during the year, against 291 in the preceding year. Only 163 of the investigations had reference to District residents, and Inquests. most of the remainder took place in the London Hospital. Whilst once more having to deplore the want of a mortuary, again I must record our thanks to those officers belonging to the Whitechapel Union, by whose kindness we have been enabled to avoid, at the least, a great deal of inconvenience, which would otherwise have occurred, through the absence of a suitable building for the reception of the dead. I am aware that the only difficulty in the matter is the acquisition of a suitable site, and this difficulty has been unsurmounted during many years, and, probably, chiefly for the reason that whilst each individual admits the necessity for such a place, he prefers that it shall be not too close to his own premises. I hope, ere long, that this difficulty will be removed. Table K (page 32) is an important one, inasmuch as it indicates the chief zymotic diseases which have come under notice during the year, and, also, because it contains a Zymotic list of the streets where they have occurred. Diseases. From this statement it will be seen that only 6 cases of small pox have been heard of, against 56 cases in 1885, and 151 during 1884. Scarlet fever contributed this year 79 cases, against 40 and 119 cases respectively in the two preceding years. It will be further noticed that 13 cases of enteric fever, and 1 case of typhus fever were recorded, being the average number for the past three years. 14 It has been the practice to refer, in these reports, to the progress made under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Acts. Last year I alluded to the result of your personal application to the Metropolitan Board of Works, regarding the " Bell Lane Scheme," recalling the fact that the first representation under the Act was made in 1877. Unfortunately matters yet remain in statu quo, so far as any advance in carrying out this scheme is concerned, but I cannot say the same regarding the property comprised within the area, for although your inspectors are constantly vigilant, and much special important work has been executed there, still the general condition of the area is of course unimproved, and the words which your late Medical Officer used in condemning it, might now be quoted with even greater force. An additional reason for including this scheme in a Bill may now be advanced to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for inasmuch as many new buildings have been recently provided in the District, some of which are inhabited, and many more are almost ready for occupation, at least no difficulty on the score of accommodation would, therefore, be incurred by causing the present tenants of the incriminated area to substitute the new and improved dwellings for their present ill-conditioned rooms. And here, gentlemen, permit me, by the courtesy of your Surveyor, to quote a few details connected with the most important sanitary work, which, probably, has been executed within the District during the history of your Board. I allude to the "Destructor," which was opened officially by Robert Gladding, Esq. (chairman to your Board), in August last. Mr. William la Riviere, under whose supervision the works were carried out, describes the structures which are above ground in the following memorandum :— Memorandum, re Description and Construction Destructor Works, Wentworth Street, Whitechapel. W. La Riviere, Architect and Surveyor. "The level of the site is in two gradients, one up to the top of "destructor furnaces, the other down to the stoke holes. "The carts of refuse ascend the high level, and discharge into "the furnaces, and the residium of clinker is taken out at the "lower level and carted away. 15 "The destrucior consists of eight cells, placed back to back "in pairs, these have been constructed, using the two best des"criptions of materials which could be obtained, with the view to "ascertaining which will stand the expansion and contraction the "best, wear and tear the best; special care has been given to the "construction of the brickwork. "There is an underground flue from the Destructor to the "shaft, it is 7 ft. high, and 4 ft. wide, connecting the former with "the latter, and along this the products of combustion travel, then "up the shaft, the distance being about 300 ft. "The shaft is construced of the best quality of Cowley stock "bricks, laid in mortar gudged with cement, in proportion varying "with the amount of elasticity considered requisite for the winding "of the shaft of this size, the cap, or terminal, is constructed of "iron-glazed brick and terra-cotta, and patent Victoria stones with "a weathering of bricks and sheet lead. "The work also comprises an office, dwelling-house for care"taker, also a well with an unlimited supply of water for many "purposes. "There are two entrances, one in Wentworth-street, the other "in George-yard. "The brickwork of the furnaces is within one foot of the walls "of adjacent dwelling-houses, without causing the least incon"venience—notwithstanding the intense heat inside the furnaces, "the bare hand can be held without danger on any external "portion of the structure." After six months' experience, it may be asserted that, so far as its capacity goes, the experiment has proved eminently successful. Refuse, of every description most likely to cause inconvenience and danger to the inhabitants of the District, when placed in the cells comprising the Destructor, very rapidly become converted into inoffensive, and, perhaps, useful clinker. It is clear, however, that the furnaces must be enlarged, and I am hopeful also, that when the additional cells are in situ, steam power will be added, so that when a Lyon's disinfecting chamber shall be placed 16 in proximity, it will be a simple matter to disinfect ' effectually,' by super-heated steam, at any hour, all articles placed in the oven. This is the more urgent, because our arrangement for such purpose is, at the present time, certainly not effective, experiments having conclusively proved that hot air penetrated so slowly into articles which were submitted to be disinfected, that after three or four hours' exposure at a temperature of 284° Fahr., a pillow was not disinfected, and many articles submitted to so high a temperature for so long a time would become damaged, if not absolutely destroyed. On the other hand, it has been shown by Professor Koch, that the various spores and germs which he submitted to steam at a temperature of 221° Fahr. for three hours, were entirely sterilized. He further found that leather was the only substance which suffered by exposure to this mode of disinfection. In the published report of the examination made by the late Colonel Sir Francis Bolton, of the water supplied by the several Metropolitan water companies during the month The London of November, 1886,'the eminent official examiner Water Supply says that, having regard to the " steady increase "in the population of the urban and suburban "districts supplied with water from the Thames by the Metro"politan water companies, the time has now arrived for immediate "action to be taken to purify the source of supply. The matter "will not admit of any further delay, and the responsibility will "be great upon those authorities and towns which persistently "neglect to undertake works to free the river from contamination, "should ever an outbreak of epidemic take place, and the fatal "words ' too late ' be said," This question, concerning as it does an essential point in the health of the inhabitants of the Metropolis, is one which, I hope, will be at once taken up, with a view to speedy reform. Here it may be mentioned that, in consequence of a report which I presented to your Board during last quarter, your Board directed that the small portion of the District which is not yet under the constant system of water supply should be represented to the Local Government Board, in accordance with the Act of Parliament, so that the entire District might be supplied with water to the best advantage. 17 The death-rate of the Whitechapel District, as I have hinted in a previous page, is considerably influenced by the common lodging-houses within it. These places are under ponce supervision, they are well-conducted, and very clean. Any case of infectious disease is at once removed, and the room, as well as the particular bedding, &c., is at once disinfected. No difficulty is experienced in this matter, because the police visitors and our own staff work together to carry out the arrangements I have mentioned. From a return kindly forwarded to me under the direction of the Chief Commissioner of Police, by Chief Inspector Cutbush, I find that in the Whitechapel District there are 149 registered lodging-houses, licensed to contain a total of 6,136 beds. The normal average occupation of these rooms probably amounts to considerably less than the accommodation which is provided, but in attractive seasons, a sudden stream flows in, and we are then, within a few days, liable to add very many persons to our population. A memorable instance of this occurred in the early part of the year, when the liberality displayed at the Mansion House caused an immense influx into the District, from all parts of the country, of persons not in the best condition to withstand the risks of disease. I have alluded to these lodging-houses as prejudicial to the District statistically, from a sanitary point of view, and this is selfevident when we reflect that the people occupying these houses add proportionately little to our birth-rate, whilst they enormously increase our sickness and death-rates. To be precise, the lodging-houses births equal 1.3 per cent. of the total District births, and 38.4 per cent. of the births of residents in the Union Infirmary, whilst the deaths in these registered houses equal 11.9 per cent. of the total District residents' deaths, and 64.5 per cent. of the total Infirmary deaths. Even if we assume that the average occupation of these dwellings equals their power of accommodation, there is then a death-rate of nearly 34 per 1000, referable to them. As a logical outcome of these figures it may be inferred how largely the sickness-rate is increased by our possession of these tenements, and how adversely the elements I have been discussing must influence all our statistics. I am anxious to draw attention to these items, not to undervalue the importance of such houses (for to the poor people who lodge in them they are of the utmost benefit), but rather to emphasize the c 18 fact that, when we show an increase of 2 or 3 per 1,000 upon the general London death-rate, at a due appreciation be given to my arguments, the Whitechapel District should be congratulated upon producing such good results with certainly not the best materials. Possibly, the better way at my disposal, by which to contrast the above results with what might be attained under different circumstances, is to state the result of an investigation into buildings in the District of a different description, I mean Model Dwellings. We have in the District, buildings constructed under the Artizans' and Labourers' Acts, and also by private enterprise, accommodating some 6423 persons. These give a mortality return of 160 per 1000, and contribute only 6.3 per cent. to the total deaths of the District, or about half that which the registered lodging-houses contribute. This contrast is still greater when it is remembered how large is the proportion of very young children in the former, and how almost entirely the latter consists of adults. Upon page 34 will be seen a record of your Inspectors' work for the year, so far as their work is capable of being registered ; and, in presenting for your perusal this important Inspectors' table, I again take the opportunity to testify Returns. to the good and faithful work performed by Messrs. Battram and Wrack. Although outside my own sphere, I think it desirable to mention that, of the 177 samples of foods submitted by these officers to your Analyst, in only 6 cases was it deemed necessary to punish the offenders by requiring their presence at the police courts, and all these cases were in the South division of the District, your Analyst having reported that the 104 samples purchased in the North division were all genuine. I have also to report that I have had some correspondence with the Metropolitan Board of Works, with reference to an Order in Council which was made on the 15th of June, 1885, relating to the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878. The following abstract relating thereto will fully explain the importance of those regulations to such a community as that which surrounds us. 19 METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. 41 & 42 Vict., Ch. 74, and the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885.

To this I replied that we would, when so applied to, carry out our disinfection, so far as we could practically do so. gratuitous!}'. I am somewhat astonished at the report of the Ambulance Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, which, whilst it in one short paragraph expresses an " opinion that such disinfection cannot be efficiently performed owing to the usual construction of those vehicles,'' in many others gives reasons why cases of infection should only be removed by themselves. This latter opinion commends itself so readily upon sanitary grounds that I sincerely hope such may be soon arranged, but, as I apprehend that the police officials are only anxious that cabs should be disinfected which have been, probably through inadvertence, subjedted to risk, I did not feel justified in withholding promise of assistance. Although three months have elapsed since consent was given, 1 have received no applications yet to redeem my promise, thus bearing out my view as to the occasional service which is demanded. In December last I received some letters from the Comptroller of the Bridge House Estates, who, writing from the Guildhall, stated that in construCtng the New Tower Bridge it would become necessary to remove the remains of the persons interred in the burial ground situate at the East end of the Tower of London, and to inter them in the Ilford Cemetery. Removal of the remains will be shortly effected under my supervision, in accordance with the terms of the Act of Parliament. The work of exhumation is now proceeding under the direction of the City Architect. The mean weekly temperature of the air during the year was 4S0-75 Fahr., which was slightly above the average for last year. The highest temperature recorded was 89°.8, on Meteorological July 6th, and January 7th, 1886, registered the Returns. lowest, when the thermometer stood at 1605. Rain or melted snow was measured during the year as producing 24.09 inches, and having fallen on 162 days. For a more detailed analysis of the records of this department, see Table N (page 35). I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH LOANE. To the Board of Works for the Whiteehapel District. APPENDIX.
