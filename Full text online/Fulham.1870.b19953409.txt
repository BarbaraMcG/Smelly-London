To the Chairman and Members of the Board of Works for the Fulham District. We hereby certify that we have carefully examined the Books and Vouchers of your Board for the year ending Lady Day, 1871. At the commencement of the year there was a balance in your favour of £1,504 0s. 9d, and there is now a balance of £480 17s. 5d. also in your favour.

We willingly bear testimony to the correct manner in which the Accounts have been kept. (Signed) JOHN BLACHFORD. J. S. WHICIIELOW. WALTER SMEE. 9 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS, FULHAM DISTRICT. GENTLEMEN, In presenting to you this my fifteenth Annual Report, I have the pleasure to state that nothing special has marked the year 1870. The sanitary condition of the District shows a steady improvement, and, when compared with the state of things which existed some sixteen years ago, at the time your Board was formed, it may truly be regarded as a matter for congratulation by the ratepayers of both Fulham and Hammersmith. When we take into consideration the enormous increase of our population, and the fact that many large tracts of our formerly open spaces have been rapidly covered, nay, densely packed, with buildings, and some of them of the most objectionable description, we need not have been surprised if the advantages of our improved drainage had been neutralized by some of the concomitants of density of population. It is a pity that the Sanitary Legislation for this Metropolis and its Environs has never been accompanied by an amalgamation of the Building Act with the general Sanitary Statutes. The act referred to still works an independent course, and it is not too much to say of it that, whilst its provisions deal strictly with the strength and quality of bricks and mortar, they utterly fail to ensure for us dwellings, especially for the working classes, which have the least pretentions to perfection in Sanitary conditions. A large number of habitations of this description have been completed and occupied during the last few vears, both in Fulham and Hammersmith, and take the place of our former fever dens in fostering disease. Unfortunately the Sanitary Autherities see these wretched structures raised before their eyes, and have no power to check their progress. It is truly to be hoped that this anomaly will soon be remedied. Since my last Annual Report was presented to you the Census 10 has boon taken, and I am enabled to lay before you the actual numbers of our population, together with the number of inhabited houses, &c. From a summary furnished to me by Mr. Cornell, the Superintendent Registrar, it will bo seen that the total population of the District is now 66,064, against 39,951 in 1861, shewing an increase in the two Parishes of 26,113, or nearly double the number of the latter Census. From the accompanying abstract it will bo seen the number of Schedules distributed to persons liable to make the Returns were, in Hammersmith, 9,404; the number of occupied houses, 6,717; empty houses, 876; houses building, 313; male inhabitants, 19,292; female inhabitants, 23,400; total inhabitants in Hammersmith alone, 42,692, or 2,741 more than the united population of Fulham and Hammersmith ten years since. In Fulham the number of Schedules issued were 5,246; occupied houses, 3,460; empty houses, 546; houses building, 66; male inhabitants, 10,970; female inhabitants, 12,402; total inhabitants, 23,372. In Hammersmith the number of inhabitants have increased 18,279, and in Fulham, 7,834, during the last decennial period. Compared with the previous Census of 1851, the population of the former Parish has increased 24,932, and Fulham, 11,486, during the intervening twenty years. Seeing, then, the onward progress of our numbers, it will not do to slumber in our Sanitary precautions. Much as has undoubtedly been done by your Board in the way of drainage, there are some parts of the District yet requiring attention in this respect. Notably a largo tract of land already covered thickly with houses, and many more proposed to bo created thereon, viz., that lying north of Blythe Lane, between it and the Kensington Railway, is in a sewage-locked condition. The prevalence of disease and of nuisance in some of the streets of this locality, Ceylon and Porten Roads particularly, has often been brought under the notice of your Board, and the time has undoubtedly arrived when the frequently-proposed outlet in Blythe Lane should be constructed. I am of opinion that no time should bo lost in prosecuting so necessary a work, for assuredly the Cholera, should it come, will find much food there to feed on, if it remain neglected; not the loss urgent also is the drainage of Star Lane, Fulham. The necessity for this I have often urged before the Sanitary Committee, and much discussion has taken place upon the point, but nothing has been done. This part of our house should also at once be put in order. There are some other 11 parts which are still deficient in drainage. Burlington Road, Fulham Fulham New Town Stanley Road, Fulham Fields; also Lillie Road' imperatively demand prompt attention; indeed, unless a better outlet for the mass of wretched houses and streets in the neighbourhood of the Old Greyhound be speedily formed, Cholera, or some other fearful Epidemic, will assuredly lay its grip upon that miserable locality. With the exception of Scarlet Fever, no disease of an Epidemic character prevailed amongst us during 1870. This disease was prevalent throughout the country, and we have felt its consequences, theugh not to any serious extent. Notwithstanding the great heat and drought of the summer months, Diarrhoea did not contribute a serious amount to our mortality. The total number of deaths in the Fulham District registered in the 52 weeks ending December 31st, 1870, was 1565, and the number of births 2337. Out of the 1565 deaths, Small Pox caused 4, Measles 46, Scarlet Fever 136, Diptheria 5, Whooping Oough 47, Fevers of various types 28, Diarrhoea 114, and Violence, 35. The deaths in Public Institutions have been 107. 63 Inquests have been held. 440 children died under one vear of age, and 307 persons had reached 60 years and upwards. Hoping this Report will oe satisfactory to you, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Tour faithful Servant, FREDK. J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health. Hammersmith, September 13th, 1871.
