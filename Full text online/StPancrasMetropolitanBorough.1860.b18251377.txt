STPAN 17 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, foe the year i860. TO THE VESTRY OF SAINT PANCEA8. Gentlemen, During the year 1860 the deaths registered in St. Pancras numbered 4234. This number includes 117 deaths of paupers in the Strand Union, which may fairly be excluded in estimating the mortality of St. Pancras. The number is thus reduced to 4117.* In looking back for several years the number of deaths is found to be in 1855, 4336; in 1856, 3857; in 1857, 3887; in 1858, 4509; and in 1859, 4276. The mortality in 1860 will admit of favourable comparison with that in 1855, in 1858, and 1859; and is only slightly above that ill 1856 and 1857, when allowance has been made for the increase in population. I am this year in a position to calculate the death-rate more accurately than in former years, by means of the census which has recently been taken. The population of this parish ascertained by the census on the 1st April last, was 198,882. Prom this number, by supposing that the rate of increase during the ten years has been uniform, the population in the middle of the year 1860 may be estimated at 196,000. If this number be taken, it gives a death-rate of 2'15 per cent., or 215 deaths to every ten thousand living. The death-rate in London, as a whole, was about 223 to every ten thousand. As compared with the surrounding districts the mortality in St. Pancras was higher than in the northern districts of London, under which are included St. Marylebone, Hampstcad, and Islington ; it was also higher than in the western districts, which include Kensington, Chelsea, St. George's, Hanover Square, "Westminster, St. Martin's-in-the-fields, and St. James's, 'Westminster. * This number is not strictly accurate, because it includes deaths in the Up' .ersity College and Royal Free Hospitals of persons not previously resident in the parish, and includes other deaths of St. Pancras people which occur in the hospitals of the adjoining parishes. Of the dea'hs in University College Hospital, 60 were not of St. Pancras people, and of those in the Free Hospital, 53 were not parishioners. Whilst in the Middlesex, Bartholomew, Charing Cross, King's College, Children's and Fever Hospitals, there were 72 deaths of St. Pancras people. By making corrections for these numbers we should have 4070 instead of 4117 deaths. 2 The parish is seen to be undergoing an annual increase of something over S000 persorte, or nearly 60 every week. The death.rates in the several sub.districts of the parish are found to vary considerably, as will be seen by a reference to Table A. The death.rate was lowest in Kentish Town, lowest but one in Eegent's Park, then in Camden Town, then in Gray's Inn Road, then in Somers Town, then in Tottenham Court Eoad. In the ratio of deaths to births the sub.districts stand in the following order, beginning with the lowest: Kentish Town, Camden Town, Somers Town, Eegent's Park, Gray's Inn Eoad, and Tottenham Court Eoad. The mortality in Kentish Town this year has fallen off very much as compared with the year 1859, when it was unaccountably very much raised. I am now, also, in possession of the population of the several sub.districts of the parish as ascertained by the recent census. The numbers are given in the quarterly tables appended to this Eeport. By comparing them with the returns obtained in 1851, it is seen that, as might be expected, the populations of the sub.districts have not increased in the same ratio, for whilst Tottenham Court Eoad, for instance, has increased only 3'2 per cent., Kentish Town has increased 89.8 per cent, in the last ten years; that is to say, has nearly doubled.* The rates of increase per cent, in the ten years and per annum for the several districts are as follows:— Rate of increase per cent, in ten years, 1851.61. Rate of increase per cent, per annum. Eegent's Park 9.4 0 9 Tottenham Court 3.2 0.3 Gray's Inn 4.8 0.48 Somers Town 9.7 0.93 Camden Town 10.8 1.03 Kentish Town 89.8 6 6 The Whole Parish 19.1 1.75 In the ten years there have been added to the population of St. Pancras 31,296 persons, whilst the number of births registered beyond the number of deaths, was 19,649, leaving 11,552 to be supplied by new residents over and above those who left the district during the period. There were 3344 more inhabited houses at the census this year, than at the census of 1851. In 1851 there were somewhat fewer than nine inhabitants to every house in the Parish, whilst in 1861 there are somewhat more than nine to every house. * These differences are explained by the extent of ground in the several sub.districts which was unbuilt upon at the census of 1851. In Tottenham Court sub.district there was no unoccupied space in 1851, and any increase of population which occurred must have led to denser crowding of dwellings already built, and not to new buildings. In Kentish Town the case was q4ite different. 3 [ Table A. ] Areas in Acres. Population in April, 1861, at the census.

X In this column the deaths which occurred in St. Pancras Workhouse, the University College, and Royal Free Hospitals, instead of being left in the sub-districts in which those institutions are situated, have been distributed amongst the several sub-districts in what is believed to be nearly their due proportion, allotting those whose previous residences have been ascertained, and calculating for the remainder in the proportion of the population of the several sub-districts. § Allowance has been made for the number of inmates of the Workhouse in making the calculation for Camden Town, f In this estimate the births in the workhouse, 208, have been deducted.

From this table I have made the following abstract, classified according to the plan adopted by the Begistrar-General:— I. Ztmotic Diseases.

Causes mot specified 28 Total 4234 Some of these diseases are of course entirely beyond the power of human arrangements to prevent, whilst others may, to a great extent, be prevented by an observance of the laws which are classed under the head of sanitary measures. The Miasmatic diseases from which there were 660 deaths, including Measles, Scarlet Fever, Small Pox, Hooping Cough, and Diarrhoea are much affected in their frequency and seriousness by sanitary appliances. There is no doubt that Tubercular diseases which caused 740 deaths, may be reduced in number to one-half by a good supply of pure air and proper food. The Nervous diseases of children are also very much dependent on impure air; these caused last year 288 deaths. The violent deaths numbered 141; of these 18 were suicidal, of which 2 were by gun or pistol shot, 2 by cutting the throat, 5 by poison, 5 by drowning, and 3 by hanging. From accident or negligence there were 108 deaths; 44 from fractures, S from cuts or stabs, 23 from burns (15 of these being children), 2 from poison, 6 from drowning, 23 from suffocation (all children and chiefly in bed). 5 The death-rates from the undermentioned diseases to every 100,000 living in St. Pancras last year are given below, together with the death-rates from the same diseases in the parish in 1858 and 1859, and the metropolis at large in 1860 :— DISEASES. St. Pancras in 1858. St. Pancras in 1859. In 1860. St. Pancras. London. Pulmonary Affections (including Phthisis) 723 587 733 690 Phthisis 276 281 279 276 Measles 94 54 53 74 Scarlatina 208 142 44 89 Hooping Cough 93 70 75 73 *Alvine Flux 65 116 51 56 [Typhus Fever 56 66 47 54 |Nervous Diseases of Infancy 125 112 147 159 There has been unusually little Fever in the parish during the year; only 16 cases were sent to the Fever Hospital at an expense to the parish of £17 16s.; in 1856 no less than £290 6s. was paid to the Fever Hospital by the Directors of the Poor of St. Pancras. Syphilis is given as the cause of 30 deaths; this number does not include all that might be traced to the same source; many of the deaths from Premature births, many of the deaths from Atrophy and Congenial Debility, and some of the deaths from skin disease are due to the same poison in the blood. It operates, too, in a hundred ways, causing predisposition to other diseases, which subsequently destroy life. From Delirium Tremens and Intemperance 10 deaths are recorded, but this number again fails to represent one-tenth part of the deaths, which directly or indirectly arise from the abuse of alcoholic drinks. Under the age of 5 years 1745 deaths occurred, about 41 per cent, of the entire number; between 5 and 10 years of age, 154, between 3 and 4 per cent, of the gross mortality; during the third five years of life only 56 deaths occurred, being considerably less than two per cent, of the whole; in the following ten years, from 15 to 25 years of age, 189 deaths; in the next ten years 277; between 35 and 45 years of age 324; between 45 and 55, 312; between 55 and 65 years, 409 ; between 65 and 75 years, 433 ; between 75 and 85 years, 264; between 85 and 95, 63; and above 95 years of age, 7 deaths. WORKHOUSE. In this establishment there have been 345 deaths, the average number of deaths in four preceding years was 374 ; so that the mortality in 1860 was low by comparison with previous years. There was only one death from Measles and two from Small Pox, whilst there was no death from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Hooping Cough, Diarrhoea, or Typhus Fevers. This speaks well for the general sanitary state of the building. One circumstance that will account for some reduction in the number of deaths from Epidemics, is the removal of most of the children into the country. * Including Diarrhoea, Dysentery, and Cholera, t Including Typhus, Typhoid, Infantile, and Remittent Fever. + Including Hydrocephalus, Convulsions, and Teething. 6 Two hundred and twenty-seven births occurred in the Workhouse, which 19 were still-births. I have again tabulated the mortality in Mews. The dfeaths numbered in 1860 were 73; of which, 27 occurred in Tottenham District, out of a population of 861; 15 in Gray's Inn District, out of a population of 520 persons; 13 in Regent's Park, out of 808 persons ; 18 in Somers Town from a population of 460 persons; no deaths occurred in lie Mews of Kentish Town, out of a population of 313; in Camden Town sub-district there are no Mews. This year I have obtained the exact population of the Mews from the census papers, and find that it is 2962, which is considerably higher than the estimate given in my Report for 1859. It must be remembered that many of the dwellings in Mews are not over stables, and some of the Mews are not used at all for keeping horses. It is also to be borne in mind, that in the Mews attached to gentlemen's houses, the families who live there not unfrequently go out of town for some weeks, and in case of dangerous illness of any members of the families they are often removed to the country or to a hospital. The actual mortality, then, will probably not accurately represent the insalubrity of rooms over stables as residences. In the Tottenham sub-district the rate of mortality was more than 3 per cent., or 31 per thousand; in Gray's Inn 29 per thousand; in Regent's Park, where there are many gentlemen's stables, only 16 per thousand; and in Somers Town 29 per thousand. In Southampton Mews, with a population of only 94, there have been 8, deaths, a mortality of 8i per cent., which is four times higher than the whole parish. These Mews are badly pared and with very imperfect sewerage. Of the total number of deaths in Mews, 12 were from Zymotic diseases; Measles, 5; Scarlet Fever, 1 ; Diarrhoea, 1; Small Pox, 1; Diphtheria, 1; Typhoid Fever, 1; Erysipelas, 1; and Croup, 1. From Bronchitis and Pneumonia 20 deaths occurred. From the Nervous diseases of infants, 7. From Consumption, 8. From Rheumatic Fever, 3. Under the age of five years there were 48 deaths. METEOROLOGY. The mean temperature of the year was 47'0, which is 3-8 below the mean in 1859, and 1*4 below the average of 89 previous years. The winter quarter averaged 38°'8, being only 0°'4 above the average of the corresponding quarters of previous years; the spring quarter had a mean temperature of 50°'5, being 1°'6 below the spring quarters in 89 preceding years; the summer quarter had a mean of only 56°-2, being 3°-3 lower than the mean; and the autumn quarter averaged 42°-6, being lo-0 below the mean of 89 years. The peculiarity consisted in the coldness of the second, third, and fourth quarters and especially of the third. The mean daily range of temperature was 140,9, being lO-0 less than usual. The mean height of the barometer was 29-699 inches, being lower than usual by -079 of an inch. The number of nights on which the thermometer fell below 30° was 112, and between 30° and 40°, 130. The rain-fall amounted to 32 inches, being 6-7 above the average in 19 years. The low temperature and the quantity of rain, no doubt, conduced to the low mortality from Diarrhoea and Cholera, and to the somewhat higher mortality from bronchial and pulmonary diseases. By comparing the tables of the quarterly mortality for 1860 with those in my Report for 1859, it will be seen that in the first quarter there was but little difference in the two years, 1286 in 1859 and 1272 in 1860; in the second quarter also but a slight difference, 1042 in 1859 and 1029 in 1860; whilst in the third, instead of 1102 in 1859, there were only 901 deaths in 1860 ; and in the fourth quarter there was an increase from 999 in 1859 to 1018 in 1860. 7 The total mortality in the two years, was 4415 in 1859 and 4234 in 1860. So that the wet and cold autumn ssems to have been very favorable to the health of St. Pancras, no doubt by flushing the roads, drains, and sewers, and by preventing the escape of effluvia into the atmosphere from decomposing organic matters. The flushing may be imitated by man, and the escape of effluvia may to a great extent be counteracted by greater attention to cleanliness, the more frequent removal of refuse, and better drainage. The difference between a hot and cold season, appears to have been indicated in St. Pancras by an addition of 200 deaths in one quarter. It is not for me to say how much the mortality may be reduced, even in hot seasons, by improved sanitary appliances; but there can be no question that very much remains to be done which has hitherto been neglected. SANITARY WORKS. The following improvements have been carried out under the immediate inspection of myself or the Sanitary inspectors:— New drainage has been supplied to 234 houses. To 666 drains, new traps have been applied. The drainage of 123 houses has been improved. 288 cesspools have been emptied, filled in, and trapped water closets substituted for them. 219 closets have been supplied with new pans, traps, and water supply. 45 new water closets have been erected. 37 new dust bins have been put up. 41 dust bins have been repaired. The yards or cellars of 76 houses have been paved. Water supply has been furnished to 24 houses. 93 houses have been cleansed and lime whited. In 7 houses overcrowding has been abated. 41 lots of pigs have been removed. 30 cow sheds have been improved. 121 other nuisances of various kinds have been abated. To effect these sanitary measures there have been issued 550 notices, of which 74 were final, and 476 preliminary. In 51 cases these notices were ineffectual, and it was necessary to summon the parties at fault before the Police Court. The number of complaints entered on the books of this department was 545. The Slaughter-houses, Cow-houses, and Mews have been periodically visited, and frequent verbal warning has been given as to the observance of greater cleanliness and more frequent removal of manure. The sausage shops, tripe boiling, and fish frying shops have been regularly visited, as well as the markets in Somers Town, High Street, Camden Town, and the Hampstead Road. There have been seized by the Sanitary inspectors, as unfit for human food, three quarters of beef, 39 joints of meat, and 3 owt. of meat from butchers' shops; 250 mackerel, 10 lots of soles, 191 red herrings, 3 barrels of herrings, 2 of periwinkles, 7 lots of plaice, 165 rabbits, 39 hams, and a large quantity of rotten oranges, crabs, and lobsters. Table VIII gives an account of the cases of sickness treated by the Parish Surgeons. The number of cases is a little higher than in 1859; there were more cases of Small Pox and of Measles, but fewer of Scarlet Fever, Low Fever, Diarrhoea, and Hooping Cough.
