REPORT OF THE VESTRY For the Year ended 25th March, 1889. The Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell beg to present the following Report of their proceedings and other matters connected therewith during the year ended on 25th March, 1889. The Parish of Clerkenwell contains 380 acres, about 65 of which are situate in the outlying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill. According to the last census the population was 69,019. The number of Assessments in the Parish is 8,534 the rateable value being £362,631. The Parish is divided into five wards, as follows: Ward No. 1 (Pentonville) comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies north of a line drawn from the west boundary of the Parish at Battle Bridge, along the centre of Pentonville Road, to the east boundary of the Parish at the top of the City Road, thence up High Street and Liverpool Road to Sermon Lane, thence westward (according to the boundary of the Parish) to Caledonian Road, including Nos. 61 to 77 and 68 to 100 in that road, and 6 to 17 Caledonian Crescent, thence to the western boundary at Battle Bridge, and all that 2 6 portion of the Parish which is situate at or about Muswell Hill. This Ward contains 1,672 assessments, of a rateable value of £61,108, and returns twelve members to the Vestry. Ward No. 2 (St. Philip's) comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of King's Cross Road, from Baker Street to Battle Bridge, thence up Pentonville Road to the north-west corner of Claremont Square, thence down Amwell Street and Rosoman Street to Exmouth Street, along Exmouth Street and Mount Pleasant to the Boundary, thence along the bounddary of the Parish to King's Cross Road, bottom of Baker Street, including nearly the whole of the House of Correction site. This Ward contains 1,412 assessments, of a rateable value of £52,366, and returns fifteen members to the Vestry. Ward No. 3 (St. Mark's) comprises all that portion of the Parish within a line drawn along Pentonville Road, from the north-west corner of Claremont Square, to the junction of City Road and Goswell Road, thence down Goswell Road to the corner of Spencer Street, (including Nos. 290 to 320 on the north-east side of Goswell Road, and Nos. 1 and 30 in Sidney Street,) thence along Spencer Street, Myddelton Street, Rosoman Street, and Amwell Street, to the north-west corner of Claremont Square. This Ward contains 1,258 assessments of a rateable value of £60,426, and returns twelve members to the Vestry. Ward No. 4 (St. James'), comprises all that portion of the Parish within a line drawn from Goswell Road, along the centre of Spencer Street, Myddelton Street, Exmouth Street, Mount 7 Pleasant, to the boundary of the Parish, thence along the line of the Old Fleet Ditch to the new street opposite Clerkenwell Green, and thence along Clerkenwell Green (north side of Sessions House) and Aylesbury Street to St. John Street, thence up the centre of St. John Street to Percival Street, along the centre of Percival Street, and up Goswell Road to Spencer Street. This Ward contains 2,596 assessments, of a rateable value of ,£106,103, and returns eighteen members to the Vestry. Ward No. 5 (St. John's), comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies south of the southern boundary of Ward 4, bounded on the east by a line drawn along the centre of Goswell Road from Percival Street to Clerkenwell Road, on the west by the Old Fleet Ditch, and on the south by a line drawn from Goswell Road down Clerkenwell Road, thence irregularly, accordingly to the boundary of the Parish, to the Old Fleet Ditch. This Ward contains 1,596 assessments, of a rateable value of £82,628, and returns fifteen members to the Vestry. Muswell Hill.—With regard to this outlying portion of the Parish, the following extract from Cromwell's History of Clerkenwell will be of interest, especially to those unacquainted with its history:— "There is a small detached portion of the Parish, situate at Muswell, or Muswell Hill, about five miles and a half from London, and on the north-western confines of Hornsey. This little tract (about 65 acres) was given to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell by Beauvais, Bishop of London, about the year 1112; and having become famous through a legendary tale of a 'great cure performed upon a King of Scots, who was, by some divine intelligence, advised to take the water of a well in England, called Muswell,' a Chapel was erected on the spot, 'sometime bearing the name of our Lady of Muswell. Here was placed an image of 'Our Lady, whereunto was a continual resort in the way of pilgrimage.' This Chapel (which of course was an appendage 8 to the Nuunery) had sunk, along with many other fabrics originating in religious romance, before the reign of Elizabeth; and, when Norden wrote, an Alderman Roe had 'a proper house occupying the site.' "The Wells, from which this tract and the hill comprising it take name, are two in number, and continue in good preservation, being bricked round to the depth from which they seemingly spring (about five feet and a half), and enclosed besides from the field wherein they are situated, by wooden railings. Though a few yards only asunder, their waters differ in quality ; that of the one being hard, sweet, and beautifully pellucid, while the other more nearly resembles rain water, and is used only for the purposes to which the latter is commonly applied. Neither are at present supposed to possess any medicinal properties. An infant brook issues from their united and ceaseless overflowing; which descending the hill and winding through the adjacent meadows, at length finds its way to the comparatively distant Lea River. "This tract is regularly visited, and its limits marked at the perambulation of the Parish, which takes takes place septennially; it is at present entirely under pasturage. The only habitations upon it are two by the road side, traditionally said to occupy the site of the dairy farm, which in the monastic time sent its produce to the nuns of Clerkenwell. Part of an adjoining house being also within the parochial line (as is signified by the usual initials affixed to its front), the perambulators are obliged to pass through this latter dwelling in order to assert their long established boundary." This part of the Parish has within the last few years been laid out for building purposes. New roads have been formed, and there are now 40 houses in assessment. Bates.—During the year the Rates made by the Yestry were as follows:— For the half-year to Michaelmas, 1888. A Poor Rate of 1s. 5d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £23,545 A Metropolitan Consolidated Rate 4d. „ „ „ 5,520 A Sewer Rate 1d. „ „ „ 1,380 A General Rate 11d. „ „ „ 15,180 2s. 9d. £45,540 9 For the half-year to Lady-day, 1889. A Poor Rate of 1s. 5d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £23,454 A Library Rate 1d. ,, ,, ,, 1,380 A Metropolitan Consolidated Rate 5d. ,, „ ,, 6,925 A Lighting Rate 2d. ,, ,, ,, 2,770 A General Rate 8d. ,, ,, ,, 11,080 2s. 9d. £45,700 The rates made in April, for the half-year to Michaelmas, were based upon a rateable value of £360,861, and those made in October, for the halfyear to Lady-day, upon a rateable value of £362,128. The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £25,179 in the first, and £23,822 in the second half-year, total £49,001 (the average for 14 years previous to the amalgamation of Clerkenwell with the Holborn Union when Clerkenwell managed its own poor under the Local Act, being £28,093, the highest year being £34,534). The Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund, £4,367 14s. 10d. and £5,021 15s. 6d. in the first and second half-years respectively. The precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works for the year 1888, was for the sum of £12,278 2s. 4d., and a supplemental precept for the three months ending 31st March, 1889, was issued for £3,765 18s. 8d., and that of the School Board for the sum of £11,717 15s. 1d. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £7,412 18s. 2d. It will thus be seen that of the £91,240 raised during the year, the sum of £71,020 was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry. 5,645 Summonses have been issued for the recovery of the rates for the four quarters of the year, representing an average of 1,411 per quarter, a 10 reduction of 285 per quarter. This appears a large number, but it is quite evident that a very large proportion of the persons summoned are content to wait for the summons, treating it as the "final demand" for payment, preferring to pay the small fee of 1s. charged for the summons and hearing, and to hold their money, as a matter of convenience, as long as possible. That this is so is patent from the fact that only about five per cent. of those summoned attend the hearing, the bulk of the remainder paying without further proceedings being necessary. 166 Committal Warrants were granted in respect of non-payment of rates, averaging 41 per quarter, the majority of the cases being those of persons who set the Vestry at defiance, and have no goods on the premises on which distress can be levied, and it may be taken that practically the same persons form the cases each quarter. In the large majority of these cases also, when proceedings have reached this extreme, the money is forthcoming. An average of 13 cases per quarter were excused by the justices on account of poverty. Interest on Bank Balances.—The Vestry have had before them the question of obtaining interest on the Vestry's Balance at the National Bank, as it appeared that a considerable sum was sometimes to the Vestry's credit during the accumulation of sums necessary to pay the precept of the Metropolitan Board and School Board. From a statement prepared it appears that the average balance during 1888 has been £3,605 7s., the lowest being £689 0s. 6d., on the 23rd February, 1888, and the highest £8,403 15s. 11d., on the 21st June, 1888. The Vestry have, therefore, been in communication with the National Bank on the matter, and have received from the Manager a letter, stating that they will allow interest at the current rate 11 from time to time given on Deposits, on the minimum monthly Vestry account balances, on sums above £1,000, which terms the Vestry accepted. Coal Plate Fees.—The Vestry have had before them the question of the inadequacy of the charge of 1s. for cutting a stone to receive a coal plate, and 6d. for lowering a plate. They found that the total sum received is insignificant, being in 1887 only £2 7s. 0d., and they therefore abolished the charge. Valuation Lists.—Five Provisional Valuation Lists and one Supplemental List have been made out during the year, dealing with 472 assessments and resulting in a decrease in the rateable value of £64. With regard to one of the Assessments comprised in such Provisional and Supplemental lists the Vestry have felt it to be necessary to appeal from the decision of the Holborn Union Assessment Committee. In the case of the stables built by Messrs. Lovell and Christmas in St. John Street, the Yestry, acting as Overseers, assessed same on the basis of £10 per stall, which assessment the Union Assessment Committee reduced to an assessment based on a value of £7 per stall. The Vestry in consequence appealed to the Special Sessions against such reduction, and the Special Sessions restored the original assessment. Messrs. Lovell & Christmas then appealed to the Assessment Sessions, which allowed the appeal, and reduced the assessment to the figures based on the £7 per stall value. Parcels Post Offices.—The Vestry Clerk, in December, 18S7, wrote to the Treasury asking whether they were prepared to renew the contribution to the rates in respect of the Parcel Post Offices erected on the Coldbath Fields Prison Site, 12 and expressing the hope that the value adopted for the purpose would more nearly approach the ordinary value than was the case when the prison existed, when contributions were based on a rateable value of £2000 for the prison and nearly nine acres of ground. To this letter a reply was received in January, 1888, stating that the only part at present occupied was a detached building formerly the Treadmill-house, and that the Treasury was prepared to contribute in respect of this on a value of £500 gross, .£417 rateable, which offer the Vestry accepted. Further alterations having been made, the Vestry again communicated with the Treasury, in February, 1889, resulting in a further interim contribution on a value of £250 gross, £208 rateable from 29th September, 1888. It is hoped that when the alterations are completed, these contributions will form a very considerable assistance to the rates of the Parish. School Board Precepts—The following is a list of the Precepts of the School Board, on the Parish of Clerkenwell, since it was called into existence by the Elementary Education Act, 1870:— £ s. d. £ s. d. 1871 511 8 9 1881 7,900 4 4 1872 943 11 2 1882 8,067 10 5 1873 780 0 2 1883 9,397 16 2 1874 1,869 9 3 1884 11,054 2 2 1875 3,267 12 11 1885 11,999 1 10 1876 4,897 4 9 1886 12,890 9 0 1877 6,046 10 1 1887 12,210 12 5 1878 6,013 14 10 1888 11,717 15 1 1879 6,371 8 11 1889 13,252 6 0 1880 7,36 9 8 Courts and Blind Alleys.—The Vestry, in June 1887, appointed a Special Committee to consider the present condition of the Courts and Blind Alleys in the Parish, commencing with those in 13 Ward No. 5 (St. John's). An important report was received from the Committee, which, together with the action of the Yestry thereon, will be found as an appendix to this Report (page 113). Metropolitan Board Precepts.—The following is a list of the Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855:— Main Drainage.

The Vestry, however, did not deem the reasons given by the Metropolitan Board of Works for not providing a subway satisfactory, and they urged upon the Metropolitan Board of Works the desirability of providing a subway at least under the remaining portion of the street. A letter in reply was received from the Metropolitan Board of Works, stating that the Board is advised that the advantages to be gained by the formation of a subway in the portion of the street referred to are not such as to justify the expenditure, and as, moreover, the Board could not construct the subway without farther Parliamentary powers, they were unable to comply with the request of the Vestry. In December a notice was received from the 15 Metropolitan Board of Works, stating that it was the intention of that Board to apply to Parliament in the ensuing Session for an extension of time for the compulsory purchase of the land and property required for the formation of the street, and asking the Vestry to express their assent, dissent, or neutrality to such proposed extension of time, and the Vestry directed that a reply be sent, stating that they regretted the further delay in the completion of the street. They also informed the Metropolitan Board of Works of their strong desire that advantage be taken of the extension of time to secure increased width in the street, and urged the Board to accede to Mr. Robson's motion with that object in view; and in January the Vestry had the satisfaction of receiving a reply from the Board that they had resolved that the portion of the new street, which will be between Mount Pleasant and St. John Street Road, shall be made of the width of 60-ft. instead of 50-ft., at an additional cost estimated at £27,000, which they are advised can be done without further Parliamentary powers being obtained. This was the stage at which the matter had arrived at the 25th March, 1889. Bolton Court.—The Report on the question of demolishing the houses in this Court under the Artizans' Dwellings Acts 1868-82, closed last year with a statement that a fresh representation by the Medical Officer had been referred to the Surveyor to report thereon in accordance with the Act. On the 5th July, the Surveyor presented his report, but the Vestry's Solicitors advised that as a considerable time had elapsed since the Medical Officer had presented his certificate, it would be better that he should give another upon which to ground the new proceedings. This was accordingly done, and the Surveyor's report followed in due course. Copies 16 of same were accordingly served on the Marquis Northampton, Mr. Lewis Thomas, Mr. S. Wenkheim and the executors of Mr. Tammadge, the owners and leaseholders of the property, and notice was given to them that the Vestry would proceed to consider same on the 4th October. Letters were in the meantime received from the Marquis Northampton and Mr. Wenkheim, stating that they would offer no opposition. The executors of Mr. Tammadge appeared by Mr. Mote, their solicitor, and offered objections, and Mr. Thomas also was present, but stated that he was not prepared to urge any objections at the present moment. After hearing the objections, the Vestry adjourned the consideration of a motion that the houses be demolished for three months. Electric Lighting.—In July, 1888, communications were laid before the Vestry from the London Electric Supply Corporation, the South Metropolitan Electric Supply Company and Messrs. W. T. Glover & Co., giving notice of their intention to apply for Provisional Orders to supply Electricity in the Parish of Clerkenwell, which were duly referred to the Works Committee for consideration and report. Messrs. Glover & Co., however took no further steps towards obtaining such an order. In due course the Committee had before them Lord Crawford, Chairman, and Mr. Medcalfe, Solicitor of the London Electric Supply Corporation, and Mr. Bircham, Solicitor of the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, on the subject. Having carefully considered the schemes, the Vestry were of opinion that it was desirable that encouragement should be given to the development of Electric Lighting, and with the view of obtaining all possible benefit to the public from the competition of the two companies, gave their assent to both schemes, subject only to the condition that they should 17 agree to keep the portion of the roads and footways which are disturbed for laying the Electric wires in repair for three years. To this condition both companies assented. The Board of Trade then appointed Major Marindin, C.M.G., to hold an Enquiry into the various applications for Electric Lighting, commencing on 3rd April, and the matter was at this stage at the close of the year to which this Report relates. Protection from Fire.—In June the Vestry received a letter from the Vestry of St. James, Westminster, in favour of Fire Escapes being kept under the charge of attendants at all times, both by day and night, to obviate the delay and danger which occurred at a recent fire in the Edgware Eoad. The Vestry, although they did not think it necessary to concur in the suggestion of the Vestry of St. James, Westminster, expressed the opinion that an extension of the time during which the men in charge of the fire escapes are on duty is desirable. In consequence of the fire referred to and to the danger shown to exist, the Vestry in July received a letter from the Metropolitan Board of Works, stating that on and after the 1st October next, the hours during which Firemen shall be on duty with the Fire Escapes shall be from 9 p.m. until 7 a.m. all the year round. The Vestry also received a letter from the St. Olave's District Board of Works, expressing the opinion that in the erection of Industrial Dwellings, the requirements for the protection of life from fire are not sufficiently considered, and that it is expedient that statutory powers should be given to some central authority to compel the provision of adequate means of protection of life from 18 fire in all houses and buildings in the Metropolis. The Vestry agreed with the views expressed therein and forwarded a letter to the Home Secretary in accordance therewith. In January a letter was received from the Vestry of Islington, in favour of Fire escapes being available at any hour of the day or night, but suggesting that the police should be trained to use them during the daytime, and asking the Vestry, if it concurred with those views, to communicate with the Home Secretary, the Commissioner of Police, and the Metropolitan Board of Works to that effect. The Vestry concurred with the representations made in such letter, and communicated with the authorities suggested accordingly. The Commissioner of Police answered the various representations by a letter to the Paddington Vestry as follows: "With reference to your letter of the 6th inst., I am directed by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to acquaint you that he understands the point which the Vestry urge on his consideration to be that the members of the Police Force ought to be trained in the use of Fire Escapes, and that it should be a standing duty of the Police to procure the Fire Escapes in all cases where the necessary Firemen are not at hand. "Under the present rules the Police give every assistance which they can on the occasion of a fire breaking out in their Divisions, and the benefit which the public derive from their efforts is cheerfully acknowledged. The Commissioner has not the slightest wish to lessen the assistance which is now given; on the contrary, he has now arranged with the Metropolitan Board of Works that at some selected Police Stations, Fire Escapes will be allowed to remain. But while anxious to give accommodation on Police premises for Fire Escapes, the Commissioners cannot agree with the Vestry that the working of such Fire Escapes, till the Firemen arrive, should be imposed on the Police as a duty. Such a duty cannot legally be demanded from a Police Constable as a Constable; and while, as before, the Police will on the occasion of Fire, cheerfully give all the assistance which they can afford consistently with their other important duties, the Commissioner cannot accept on their behalf the responsibility which the Yestry think should be attached to them as a standing duty." 19 Royal Academy of Arts.—In May, 1888, the Vestry forwarded a Petition to the President and Council of the Royal Academy of Arts, pointing out that the necessity of daily labour precluded the large majority of the working classes from visiting art galleries and institutions of a kindred nature during the hours at which they are ordinarily open to the public, and asking whether, having regard to the importance of bringing the refining and educating influence of such institutions within the reach of artizans, they would allow their galleries to be open on Saturday evenings at the same entrance fee, and during the same hours as they are opened in the last week of the Exhibition. The Vestry also invited the other Vestries and District Boards to support their Petition, and thirteen of them did so. The Vestry, on the 9th August, received a reply from the Academy stating that they have carefully considered the matter, and hope to arrive at a decision before the Exhibition for 1889. St. James Churchyard.—The Vestry have had before them from time to time the question of laying out St. James Churchyard as an open space. An Act passed in 1887, the Open Spaces Act, defines the steps which are to be taken, which are very lengthy and time-consuming. These steps have however been taken, and at the close of the period to which this Report relates considerable progress had been made in the formalities necessary before a faculty can be obtained for carrying out the work. Open Space St. John Street Road, near Percival Street.—An old plan, dated April, 1816, has been found during the year among some similar documents in the Surveyor's office, “of the piece of vacant ground situate between Northampton Street and St. John Street Road, given up by the 20 Marquess of Northampton to the Commissioners for paving, &c., St. James, Clerkenwell, and enclosed by them." This plan refers to the piece of ground at the end of Percival Street which has been thought to belong to the Northampton Estate, and further search among the parochial records confirms the fact that the land is parish property. The Vestry have therefore decided to pave the ground with asphalte and enclose it with iron railings, to serve as a playground for children in this densely populated part of the parish. Wilmington and Northampton Squares.— These enclosures, taken over by the Yestry in July, 1887, continue to be a boon to the dwellers in the thickly populated parts of the parish. An offer of the Band of the G. Division of Police to play in the squares on alternate Saturday afternoons was accepted by the Vestry. The cost of the squares for the year is as follows:— For Wilmington Square £105 18 4 Northampton Square 77 14 7 £183 12 11 Land at junction of Cyrus Street and Percival Street.—In June. 1888, a letter was received from the Solicitor of the Marquis Northampton pointing out that the tenancy by the Vestry, of the piece of ground at the corner of Percival Street and Cyrus Street, upon part of which Lord Northampton put up a drinking fountain, expired at Lady-day, and stating that Lord Northampton is not at present proposing any comprehensive changes in that immediate neighbourhood, and suggesting whether the Vestry would be willing to remain yearly 21 tenants of the piece of ground (subject to six months' notice on either side) on the terms of the Agreement which expired at Lady-day last. The Vestry consented to the proposal, and the Agreement was endorsed accordingly. Urinal Accommodation—Kiosks.—The Vestry have had before them from time to time a letter from the International Hygienic Society, calling attention to the present lack of proper accommodation and retirement in London for residents as well as visitors, and peculiarly women and children; which want the Society proposes to remedy. The letter stated that in order to more efficiently realise its end, the Society is fully prepared to take upon itself: (1.) The erection and maintenance of urinals, closets, and retiring places, above-ground and under-ground, both for men and women, of the very latest approved construction and artistic appearance. (2.) The substitution of such structures for those now obsolete, worn-out, and otherwise objectionable. (3.) The addition to those deficient of the requisite improvements. and is prepared to execute the above works, under adequate guarantee, and after accepted plans, and maintain them at its sole charge, and on such sites as the Vestry shall grant to it as most suitable for the purpose. The Society asked for the permission of the Vestry to erect one of its Kiosks on Clerkenwell Green, in front of the Sessions House, as an experiment. It produced designs of the erections in other parts of London, by which it appears that within the building there is a free urinal of six stalls, a small charge being made for the use of the closet or lavatory. No advertisements are to be displayed outside the Kiosks, and the Vestry is to be at 3 22 liberty to have same removed immediately if it is disapproved of. The Vestry appeared to be sufficiently safeguarded iu the matter, and were of opinion that it is desirable to test the utility of this attempt to deal with a difficult subject. They therefore decided that, subject to the necessary agreement being entered into, permission be granted to erect a Kiosk on Clerkenwell Green, and such structure has since been erected. Colney Hatch Lane, Sewerage.—After an interval of about two years, during which (in 1887) the Metropolitan Board of Works obtained an Act to empower them to arrange with the local authority of one of the adjacent districts for the drainage of the outlying part of Clerkenwell at Muswell Hill, to deal with this vexed question, the Vestry in July, 1888, received a letter from the Solicitor of the Metropolitan Board of Works stating that an arrangement has been entered into with the Hornsey Local Board for taking and dealing with the sewage of the detached portion of the parish, and forwarding a draft agreement for the purpose. That agreement provided that in consideration of certain payments to be made to the Hornsey Local Board by the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Hornsey Board should allow the Vestry and every owner or occupier to connect their drainage with the main sewer in Colney Hatch Lane, and that the Vestry should prevent, as far as practicable, storm water from entering such main sewer. The Hornsey Board substituted for the first part of the agreement a proviso that they should make any necessary connections with their sewer at the expense of the Vestry, owner or occupier, and they also inserted a proviso that owners or occupiers connecting with the sewer in Colney Hatch Lane should contribute a sum towards the original cost of construction of such sewer. The Vestry agreed 23 to these terms with the exception of the last, which they thought too onerous, considering the amount of the annual payments to be made to the Hornsey Board. The draft agreement was accordingly returned and nothing more was heard of the matter till the 11th December, when a letter was received from the Metropolitan Board of Works stating that the Hornsey Local Board had written to them to know how the Yestry propose to deal with storm water, and asking what answer they shall return. The Yestry replied that all the storm water is provided for with the exception of that which falls on Colney Hatch Lane, and that that does not enter the Hornsey Sewerage system. The next the Yestry heard of the matter, was the forwarding by their Solicitors of a copy of correspondence between the Solicitor of the Metropolitan Board and the Solicitor of the Hornsey Local Board, by which it appeared that the negociations were for the present broken off, the Hornsey Board declining to accept the agreement on the subject of the storm water, nor would they give way on the question of the payment by the frontagers in Colney Hatch Lane of a proportion of the cost of constructing the sewer. The alternative of the Vestry agreeing to these terms appeared to be that the matters would be referred to the Local Government Board for decision, and they, therefore, left the matter in the hands of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Metropolitan Board thereupon consented to the payment by the frontagers in Colney Hatch Lane, and invited an expression of the Hornsey Board's opinion as to the manner in which the storm waters are to be dealt with. The Hornsey Board replied suggesting that the Vestry should place a line of pipe along the line of the ditch which used to form the natural watercourse before 24 the widening of the road, but which was then filled in. After a thorough examination and consideration of the matter, the Vestry resolved that a pipe-drain be laid, and gullies constructed to take off the surface water, and to discharge same into the brook opposite the boundary road (Barnard Hill) at the northern extremity of the parish. The Surveyor then reported that, in opening down upon the gullies and ventilators, he found that there is a 12-in pipe drain under the footway from tho northern boundary of the Parish of Clorkenwell for a distance of about 130 yards, and that there is a barrel drain passing from the lower gully underneath the carriageway of Colney Hatch Lane, and evidently intended to discharge into the ditch on the Hornsey side of the road, find thence into a brook in the meadows, and that the outlet of this barrel drain is blocked up, and also that the gullies and ventilating shafts had been constructed in a most careless and improper manner, and he had therefore had two brick gullies, with proper traps and gratings, constructed so as to connect with the drain referred to. Tho Vestry have thereupon called upon the Hornsey Local Board to open up the outlet of the barrel drain referred to so that the surface water passing down Colney Hatch Lane may find its proper outlet. Constant Water Supply.—In November, 1888, the Vestry passed a resolution that the Now River Company be requested to give a constant watersupply to the remaining part of Clorkenwell at present unsupplied. To this request the Ventry received a reply from the Company stating that the Local Government Board are empowered to initiate constant supply, if they think proper to do so; and that it would be 25 conformable both with the provisions of the Act, and with practice, for the Company to await an expression of wish from that Board before undertaking to make an alteration in the present system, and therefore leaving it to the vestry to place themselves in communication with the Local Government Board. This course the Vestry accordingly took, and in February they received a communication from the Local Government Board, forwarding a copy of a letter from the Company stating that steps will be taken for carrying out the extension of the system to the whole of the parish. Local Government Act, 1888.—The Local Government (England and Wales) Bill received the Royal Assent on the 15th August, 1888. The Act has constituted County Councils throughout England and Wales, and has replaced the Metropolitan Board of Works by a London County Council directly elected by the ratepayers. The Bill originally proposed to constitute subsidiary bodies to be called District Councils throughout England and Wales, with the exception of the Metropolis, but time would not allow of that portion of the Bill being then dealt with, and the proposed legislation as to District Councils was omitted. With the exception of two or three points hereafter referred to, the Act does not directly affect the local authorities of the Metropolis. The principal of these points is with regard to Main Roads. Sec. 41 of the Act extends the provisions of the Highways and Locomotives Act, 1878, to London, and Main Roads in the Metropolis will in future be maintained and repaired by or at the cost wholly or partially of the County Council. As the question of what are Main Roads has given rise to much difficulty, the Vestry of Chelsea convened 26 a Conference of the local authorities to consider the matter, to which this Vestry sent delegates. The Conference met on the 14th February and passed the following resolutions:— Resolved—That in the opinion of this Conference the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis should make application to the County Council for orders declaring those highways in their respective districts, which are means of communication between different districts, or thoroughfares to railway stations, or which are used largely by metropolitan traffic, as opposed to local traffic, to be main roads under the Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act, 1878, and the Local Government (England and Wales) Act, 1888, and the Conference is further of opinion that the County Council should make such orders accordingly. Resolved unanimously—That in the opinion of this Conference the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis should claim to retain the powers and duties of maintaining and repairing main roads within their districts. The Vestry agreed with these resolutions, and have submitted the following list of thoroughfares to the Council in accordance therewith, viz. : Caledonian Road Clerkenwell Road Farringdon Road Goswell Road High Street King's Cross Road Pentonville Road St. John Street St. John Street Road Another alteration made by the Act is that the Council may contribute one half of the salaries of the Medical Officers of Health appointed in future by the Vestries and District Boards, and the appointment of such officers to be subject to the regulations of the Local Government Board. The Vestry of Camberwell, since the close of the official year have convened a conference of Vestries and District Boards on the subject. The mode to be adopted for raising the rate required by the Council was apparently involved in some obscurity before the issue of its first precept, and the Vestry gave very anxious consideration to the question, as it arose at the time of making the half-yearly rates, and it was important to know definitely whether the rate would be con- 27 tinued as a separate rate like the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate, or whether it would be collected as a County Rate, that is to say, as part of the Poor Rate. The ultimate decision of the Council, after taking eminent legal advice, was to issue its precepts to the Guardians of the Poor as a County Rate. The above are the principal changes effected by the Act so far as the local authorities of the Metropolis are concerned, though many are made in the transfer of the administrative duties of the Justices to the Council, and in other important matters, but as they do not affect the Vestries and District Boards, they do not call for comment here. The Local Government Board having settled the boundaries of the Electoral Divisions on the lines of the Parliamentary Divisions, the first election for Members of the County Council took place on the 17th January, 1889. Notwithstanding the dissatisfaction thought to exist with the method of election of the old Metropolitan Board of Works, and the agitation which had been raised in favor of the principle of direct election, only about half the electors recorded their votes, the numbers polled being as follows:— ELECTED. Earl Compton 2,333 Mr. Frederick Alfred Ford 1,461 NOT ELECTED. Mr. Henry Edward Davis 1,074 „ William Robson 841 „ William Davies 561 „ Joseph John Goode 474 „ John Ross 74 Local Government—District Councils.—In connection with the extension of the London Government Schemes to the various districts, the Vestry 28 received letters from the Vestries of Islington and Fulham, urging that in any measure to be introduced affecting the Local Government of the Metropolis the power to make and collect the Poor and Local Rates should he transferred to the District Councils, or such other bodies as it may be proposed to create for the Local Government of the respective Parishes or Districts comprised in the new County of London, and that provision should be made for the Accounts of all Local Rates being audited in the same manner as the Poor Law Accounts. This Vestry fully agreed as to the desirability of these suggestions being acted upon, and they have accordingly addressed a communication to this effect to the Local Government Board, and to the Members of Parliament for this Borough. Election of Guardians of the Poor.—The Vestry have had before them a letter from the Vestry of St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark, forwarding resolution inviting the Public Boards of the Metropolis to co-operate in securing an assimilation of the mode of electing Guardians of the Poor to that now in use at Parliamentary and School Board Elections, “as the present system is at once cumbrous, uncertain, expensive and calculated to shake the confidence of the public in a very responsible body and their Clerk, whom the present system makes their master.” The Vestry agreed to co-op orate in the matter, and asked the Vestry of St. George-the-Martyr to indicate the method of co-operation. Official Voting Papers at Vestry Elections.— The Vestry received a letter from the Vestry of Kensington in favour of the compulsory use of Official Voting Papers at Vestry Elections, and suggesting that communications be made to the Local Government Board and the Metropolitan 29 Board of Works requesting that action may be taken to obtain an amendment in the law before the next Election. The Vestry agreed with the views of the Kensington Vestry, and made communications to the Local Government Board and Metropolitan Board of Works accordingly. Replies were received from the Local Government Board acknowledging the receipt of the Vestry's communication, and from the Metropolitan Board of Works stating that the Board could not obtain any amendment of the law on the subject during the ensuing Session of Parliament. Old Records—At the meeting of the Vestry on 21st June, 1888, the Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A., the Vicar, said he wished to hand over to the Vestry a collection of old papers which had recently come into his possession, and which might prove of local interest. They contained a statement of the poor rata for Clerkenwell from 1796 to 1849, in fact, the account ran on to 1867. They were not quite complete, but they contained statements of the poor rate, and some very interesting information was given. Amongst other things, it appeared that in the year 1821, a census was taken of the parish by the churchwardens and overseers, when there were 9,726 families in the parish; these being classified as follows:—Engaged in Agriculture, 72; in trade, 6,953; no occupation, 2,701. There were then 10 parishioners over 90 years of age and under 100 years. The papers further contained a report with reference to the Trustee Board in 1829, about which it gave some very interesting figures. The trustee rate of 6d. in the £ they then found brought in £2,900; so they would see there was a great difference in the rateable value between then and now. The poor rate only amounted to £8,333 in 30 1797. An unanimous vote of thanks was passed to the Vicar for his gift. Condition of Poor in East London.—Pauper Immigration.—In June the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry of St. John at Hackney, forwarding resolution “That the Vestry views with anxious concern the condition of the Poor in the East End of London, and is opinion that legislative measures should be taken to stay the immigration of persons from abroad who are either already paupers, or in such circumstances of destitution as to insure their speedily becoming so.” The Vestry adopted a similar resolution on the 1st December, 1887, which was forwarded to the President of the Local Government Board, and they now again adopted such a resolution, and forwarded same to the Local Government Board. School Board for London (Pensions) Bill, 1888. —In June, 1888, a letter was received from the Vestry of Islington, stating that they have petitioned against the School Board for London (Pensions) Bill, to enable that Board to grant snperanuations and pensions to its officers and servants. This Vestry concurred in the views of the Vestry of Islington, and presented a similar Petition to the House of Commons. The Bill, however, made no progress, and was eventually dropped. Vestrymen's Qualification Bill, 1888.—The Vestry also passed a resolution approving of the Vestrymen's Qualification Bill, introduced by Mr. James Rowlands, M.P., proposing to repeal so much of the Local Management Act as requires that persons to be qualified as Vestrymen shall be rated at either ,£25 or £40, and providing that any occupier rated to the relief of the Poor shall be eligible for the office, and Captain Penton, M.P., was asked to 31 support the Bill, and a copy of the resolution was forwarded to Mr. Ritchie, M.P., the President of the Local Government Board. The Bill, however, made no progress, and was eventually dropped. School Board Elections.—As foreshadowed in last year's Report, the School Board Election Bill failed to pass into law, and in December a letter was received from the Vestry of St. Pancras, inviting the appointment of Delegates to a Conference at that Vestry Hall, on the 9th January, to consider the best course to be adopted to secure an amendment of the law so as to provide for Parliamentary areas being constituted the electoral divisions of the School Board, so as to give more direct representation, and abolish the cumulative vote. The Vestry appointed Mr. Reason, Mr. Lyons and Mr. Kelly as Delegates to such Conference, and at the Conference the following resolutions were passed:— 1.—That in the opinion of this Conference many persons who would be willing to serve on the London School Board are practically prohibited from becoming Candidates for a seat on account of the enormous expense of contesting an Election in so arge a Division, and, if the Parliamentary Divisions were chosen as the representative areas, the Candidates would be more likely to be known and recognised by the Ratepayers. 2.—That in the opinion of this Conference there should be two Members of the School Board elected for each Parliamentary Electoral Division in the Metropolis, and that the cumulative vote should be abolished. 3.—That for the reasons stated in the first resolution, this Conference is of opinion that the principles affirmed by Parliament in the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885, and in the County Councils Act, 1888, should be applied to future Elections of the School Board, and that the Members of Parliament for the Metropolis be requested to support an amendment of the law by making the Parliamentary Election Districts the areas for the future Elections of that Board. 4.—That in the opinion of this Conference all vacancies on the London School Board should be filled up by the Ratepayers, and not by the Board. 32 5.—That a Petition be presented to Parliament in support of the proposed amendments; that a Deputation be appointed to wait upon the Committee of the Privy Council on Education to express the views of the Conference, and that the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis be communicated with and requested to present to Parliament Petitions in favour of the proposed amendments, and to request their Parliamentary Representatives to support such Petitions. A letter was afterwards received from Mr. T. E. Gibb, Vestry Clerk of St. Pancras and Hon. Secretary of the Conference, stating that the Education Department had replied that it was at present premature to receive the Deputation. A Bill with the above object has again been introduced into Parliament, but no progress has been made with it. City of London Parochial Charities.—By an Act passed in 1883, to make provision for the better application and management of the Parochial Charities of the City of London, the Charity Commissioners were empowered to make Schemes for this purpose. In the first place the Commissioners are bound to compensate vested interests and fair claims on moral grounds, and to maintain any existing object within the City Parishes which the Commissioners may think proper, legal and substantially beneficial to the inhabitants or any class thereof, or so as to secure to the inhabitants and to persons employed in the Parishes the benefits of those things which the Act specifies as good for London at large. The surplus fund may be applied to some or all of the following objects:— The promotion of the Education of the Poor, by means of Exhibitions, Technical Instruction, Secondary Education, Art Education, or Evening Lectures. The establishment of, and maintenance of, Libraries or Museums, &c., in such a way as to be useful for the Poor, The provision of Open Spaces. 33 The promotion and extension of Provident Institutions for working men and women. The establishment and maintenance of Convalescent Hospitals. The general improvement of the condition of the Poor. In 1887 the Charity Commissioners issued statements classifying the funds, and showing the present application of them, and as they were then in a position to proceed to make the Schemes, the question was ripe for consideration and discussion. In December, 1887, the Vestry received a communication from the London Municipal Reform League, giving reasons why Open Spaces should be one of the principal objects for the use of the surplus funds, and in January, 1888, a letter from the Vestry of Chelsea, expressing the opinion that the promotion of Technical Education is an object to which preference should be given. It was thought that as Public Libraries were among the objects for the application of the fund, some aid might be obtained for the Clerkenwell Library, then just called into existence by the vote of the ratepayers, but this hope was dispelled by the answer of the Charity Commissioners to a Deputation from the Parish of St. Pancras, who approached them with a similar view, that they did not favor the distribution of these funds to individual parishes, but wished to give them a broader scope. The Vestry, therefore, on the 1st March, 1888, passed a resolution to invite the views of the other Vestries and District Boards of Central London as to the desirability of a joint Deputation to the Charity Commissioners, urging the very strong claims of Central London, where so many of the city workmen live, to participate in the disposal of the Fund. The Vestry of St. Luke, and the Holborn District Board of Works responded to the invitation, 34 and delegates from each parish were appointed. The delegates met from time to time to consider the question, in the course of which the Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A., Vicar of Clerkenwell, was appointed Chairman, and Mr. Paget, Vestry Clerk of Clerkenwell, Hon. Secretary to the Finsbury Conference, and, at one of these Meetings, in May, they unanimously passed tho following resolutions:— 1.—That in the opinion of the Delegates, an Institution, similar in character to the Peoples Palace at Mile End, combining means of recreation and Technical Education, is required for Central London. 2.—That in the opinion of the Delegates an Institution of the nature indicated in the foregoing resolution has many claims upon the fund arising from the City Parochial Charities Fund, from which fund a large contribution in aid should be given. 3.—That, in view of the promises of assistance to like objects from the City Parochial Charities Fund, made to representatives of other Districts of the Metropolis by the Charity Commissioners the Delegates are of opinion that the Commissioners should be approached with the view of obtaining contributions for the proposed Institution for Central London. 4.—That the proposals contained in the foregoing resolutions be submitted to the Local Authorities of the various Districts interested, and that it be suggested to them to appoint Members to form a Joint Deputation to wait upon the Charity Commissioners for the purpose referred to in the last resolution. In accordance with these resolutions, a large Deputation, introduced by Captain Penton, M.P., waited on the Charity Commissioners on the 20th June, and presented a Memorial praying for a promise of support, both to the establishment and endowment of an Institution for the benefit of Central London.* In the conversation which ensued, Mr. Anstie, Q.C., the Commissioner, intimated that it would * As this subject is not only an interesting one, but one which vitally concerns the educational and material interests of the Parish and its trade, progress and prosperity, a full Keport of the proceedings at this Meeting, with the Memorial presented, will be found as an Appendix No. 4. 35 be more convenient to strike out Holborn and include Clerkenwell and St. Luke's in a general scheme affecting the North and North Eastern Districts, such as Islington, Hackney and Shoreditch, and with regard to the financial part of the question the Commissioners made the same offer as they made to South London, viz., to give £1 for each pound collected up to a sum of £200,000. Resulting from this expression of the Commissioners' opinion, a Conference of representative men of the parishes indicated, including most of the Members of Parliament for the various Boroughs, was held in July at the house of Mr. Percy Bunting, to formulate a scheme for North London including therein the Boroughs of Hackney, Islington St.Pancras and Finsbury. A Deputation subsequently waited on the Charity Commissioners, and a Meeting was afterwards held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, when the organization of a Committee was proceeded with. Largely attended Meetings were subsequently held in various parts of North London—the Finsbury Meeting at the Holborn Town Hall, on 7th December, when the Marquis of Lome presided, supported, among others, by Captain Penton, M.P., Sir Albert Rollit, M.P.,Earl Compton,Mr. James Rowlands, M.P,, Mr. B. Lucraft, and the Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A., but since that time to the close of the year to which the report relates, no perceptible advance has been made in the matter. 36 Meetings.—The following is a list of the number of Meetings of the Vestry and its Committees during the year:— Vestry 48 Works Committee 45 Works Sub-Committee 3 Rota Committee 3 Sanitary Committee 22 Assessment Committee 31 Sub-Assessment Committee 1 Finance Committee 19 Parliamentary Committee 3 Special Committees 8 Petty Sessions 4 Open Spaces Committee 2 189 ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. 4 STATEMENT and ACCOUNT of all Moneys Received and Expended from 26th March, 1888 to 25th March, 1889.

PURSUANT to the 195th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, We hereby certify that we have carefully examined the respective Accounts of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint James and Saint John, Clerkenwell, for the year ending Lady-day, 1889, and that we find them to be true and correct except that we disallow and surcharge the following items of payment, viz.;—Messrs. Boulton, Sons & Sandeman, on account of the Free Library, £11 4s. 2d, TestimoniaJ to Mr. Kellaway, £15 15s. We disallow and surcharge the above items on the ground that the payments were, and are inexpedient, undesirable, and illegal and improper payments out of the General Rate of the Parish, and we surcharge the following persons with such payments, viz.:— The payment to Messrs. Boulton, Sons and Sandeman, on Mr. W. Robson, Mr. J. J. Goode, and Mr. W. Pierpoint. The payment in respect of the Testimonial to Mr. Kellaway, on Mr. W. Robson, Mr. Jas. Gibson and Mr. W. Pierpoint. We also find other 6ums paid which are illegal, but we think them expedient on account of the circumstances of the cases. We also have much pleasure in expressing our approval of the admirable way in which the clerical part of the duties are performed. Dated this 26th day of June, 1889. ROBERT TILL, T. GRANVILLE HOCKRlDGE, HENRY VOSE, Auditors. We cordially endorse and sign the Balance Sheet and Report of approval of the correct and admirable manner in which the clerical duties are carried out, but we altogether dissent from the disallowance and surcharge above referred to.

Surveyor's Office, Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, 19th September, 1889. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before yon my "Report upon the Works, &c., executed by your Vestry during the year ending Lady-day, 1889. SEWERS AND GULLIES. One hundred and twenty-six sewers were cleansed and repaired, 5 new side entrance covers were fixed, 7 new gullies constructed (including 2 at Muswell Hill) 465 cleansed and repaired, 3 trapped, 1 gully drain reconstructed, 13 new gully grates were fixed, and 3 patent gullies, 7 gully grates repaired, and three flushing shafts constructed. One hundred and ninety two loads of deposit were removed from the sewers and gullies. 58 During the hot weather the gullies were well sprinkled with carbolic powder, and occasionally flushed out by means of a hose attached to water van. The pipe sewers in the Parish were flushed by water supplied by the New River Company from time to time, and the brick sewers, where practicable, by water from the main sewers being turned through them by means of flushing gates fixed in the sewers for that purpose. The amount paid for water for flushing the pipe sewers was £16 19s. 10d. The Skinners' Company, at their own expense, with the permission of the Vestry, constructed a 12-inch pipe sewer from the head of brick sewer opposite No. 34, Skinner Street to No. 32 Skinner Street. COURT FLUSHING. The courts and alleys in the Parish were washed and sprinkled with carbolic acid from August 25th to September 22nd. Owing to the wet weather it was not considered necessary to commence the flushing earlier. HOUSE DRAINAGE. The total number of premises drained were 197 (including 2 new houses in the outlying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill), the details of which drainage is shown upon 141 plans prepared for that purpose, and deposited in the Surveyor's office. 59 These drains consist of 2 12-inch, 14 9-inch and 129 6-inch. The amount of fees received for making the connections of the new drains to the sewers was £145 10s. 6d. Seventy three private drains were unstopped by the sewermen at the expense of the owners of the premises, for which the sum of £7 6s. was received by the Vestry. PAVEMENTS. Carriageways.—The carriageway of Warner Street, between Great Bath Street and Ray Street, was taken up, dressed and relaid, and the deficiency made good with second-hand dressed granite cubes. Channels.—The channels of Cumming Street were taken up and relaid with second hand granite cubes. Macadam Roads.—Re-metalled and steam rolled —East side Wilmington Square, Vernon Street, Cumming Street (between Pentonville Road and Collier Street), Upper Smith Street and Upper Charles Street. Footways.—The kerbs and footways of Bond Street, Great Percy Street, Wharton Street, Percy Circus, Upper Vernon Street, Vernon Street, Granville Street, Granville Square, were relaid where necessary by the Vestry's workmen, and the deficiency made good with new York. 60 Cumming Street.—The Vestry of Clerkenwell and the Islington Vestry, at their joint expense, pulled down the wall that divided Cumming Street from Cumming Street North, and altered the levels of the footways and carriageway, so as to make a thoroughfare between pentonville Road and Wynford Road. South Street.—By order of the late Metropolitan Board of Works this thoroughfare has been re-named Southern Street. REFUGES. The centre circular refuge, at the intersection of St. John Street Road, Pentonville Road, Goswell Road and High Street, was removed, and an oblong refuge fixed in the carriageway of each of the above named streets, the three former at the expense of the Clerkenwoll Vestry, and that in High Street by the Islington Vestry. The footway paving, between the Red Lion P.H., in St. John Street Road, and the Urinal at the end of Spencer Street, was taken up, and a thoroughfare for a vehicular traffic formed, with a refuge in the centre of the crossing.

URINALS. The whole of the public urinals in the parish were tarred. 64 They were cleansed three times per day on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesday, and twice a day on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, and once on Sundays. On Thursdays and Fridays the men clear out the patent gullies in the Courts and Alleys, hence the urinals only being cleansed twice instead of three times. Owing to the rebuilding of the "Midshipman" P.H., Skinner Street, it was considered desirable to set back the urinal at the side of these premises; the work was carried out at the expense of the owner of the "Midshipman." A new urinal was erected at the north end of Winchester Street, at the joint expense of the Clerkenwell and Islington Vestries. Application was made by the International Hygienic Company, for permission to remove the urinal on Clerkenwell Green and to erect a Kiosk in place of same; the whole of the expense to be borne by the Company. The Vestry gave their consent to the proposal, and a Kiosk, having a free urinal with six stalls, and w.c. accommodation for five persons (for the use of which a fee of one penny each person is charged) has been erected under the direction of your Surveyor. STREET WATERING. The street watering was done by the Vestry's own vans, extra horses being hired as required. 3,711,000 gallons of water were used, the amount paid for which, including rent of meters, was 65 £170 13s. 3d. This amount is considerably below the average cost, owing to the exceptionally wet summer. A Telephone was fixed on June 12th, 1888, between the Vestry Hall and Phoenix Wharf. It has proved to be a very great convenience in carrying out the work of the parish. I have now adverted generally to the principal works in my department upon which I have been engaged during the past year. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM IRON, Surveyor. 67 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1888. To the Vestry St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, 1 do myself the honour of laying before you my Thirtythird Annual Report, viz.: that for the year 1888. The number of deaths occurring from all causes in Clerkenwell during the year 1888 was 1,168. The annual average for the last ten years was 1,250, so that the deaths were 82 less than the average. The deaths in 1887 having been 1,216, those in 1888 were 48 less than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in the Parish in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite:— 1879 DEATHS. BIRTHS. 1,456 2,667 1880 1,313 2,430 1881 1,254 2,414 1882 1,261 2,420 1883 1,172 2,402 1884 1,303 2,448 1885 1,195 2,390 1886 1,170 2,279 1887 1,216 2,363 1888 1,168 2,311 The births were thus 52 less than in the preceding year, and 101 less than the average. 68 According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the deaths and births occurred, they stand thus:— DEATHS. BIRTHS. EXCESS. St. James 315 593 278 Amwell 308 560 252 Pentonville 277 532 255 Goswell 268 626 358 In each year, a number of deaths of the parishioners takes place in general and special Hospitals, in the Workhouses, in the Infirmary, and in Lunatic Asylums, all of which are extra- parochial. The number of deaths which occurred in the Hospitals was 161; in the Workhouses, 79; in the Infirmary, 105, and in the Lunatic Asylums, 8; 3 deaths also occurred in the street; so that the extraparochial deaths in all amounted to 356; making a grand total of 1,524. At the Census in 1871, the population of Clerkenwell amounted to 65,380; in 1881, to 69,076; the increase being 3,696. Assuming this rate of increase to have continued during the last seven years, the present population of the Parish would be 71,659. At this rate, the intra-parochial mortality for the year has been 16.2 per 1,000; including the hospital deaths, 18.5; and the workhouses and infirmary deaths, 21.2 per 1,000. Hence the mortality of the year has been slightly below that of the preceding year, and is below the average of the last 10 years. Hence, although the mortality of the year has slightly diminished, it would certainly be less if the order and personal and home cleanliness of many of the inhabitants were more carefully attended to. In the model dwellings, where these conditions are studiously observed, the mortality is much lower. Thus in the Farringdon Road Buildings, which I do not consider the very best in the parish, the mortality of the year has been 12 per 1,000 only, against 21 per l,000 in the whole parish, and 18 in the Metropolis. The mortality of all London during the year, was 18 5—That of the West Districts, 18.3; the £orth Districts, 16.6; of the Central Districts, 25.7; of the East Districts, 21.8; and of the South Districts, 17.2. 69 The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic (infectious and contagious) diseases in the Parish in 1888, was 212 being 22 less than in the preceding year. The number and the causes of the deaths from zymotic diseases occurring in Clerkenwell during the last 10 years are exhibited in the following table:— SMALL POX. MEASLES. SCARLET FEVER. DIPHTHERIA. HOOPING COUGH. TYPHOID FEVER. DIARRHŒE. TOTALS. 1879 1 74 39 5 61 11 36 227 1880 2 26 45 6 87 14 65 245 1881 10 39 46 8 53 26 58 240 1882 0 61 50 10 81 18 40 260 1883 0 61 36 10 33 16 59 215 1884 6 48 15 12 69 7 79 236 1885 6 87 14 7 52 5 58 229 1886 0 18 8 4 42 7 93 172 1887 0 68 14 3 55 6 88 234 1888 0 62 8 10 63 4 65 212 Forty-three deaths occurred from zymotic diseases in extraparochial hospitals; viz.:—2 from measles; 10 from scarlet fever; 16 from diphtheria; 8 from typhoid fever; and 7 from diarrhoea. The average number of deaths arising in the Parish from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years was 227, so that the number for 1888 was 15 below the average. One case of Small Pox was brought into the Parish during the year. The number of deaths from Measles was high, although not quite so high as in the preceding year. 6 70 The deaths from Scarlet Fever were nearly the same as in the previous year. Most of the deaths occurred in the Hospitals of the Asylums Board, to which 145 cases were sent from Clerkenwell. In the subjoined table will be found the number of cases of zymotics diseases sent from the various Parishes of the Metropolis during the year: — District. Small Pox. Scarlet Fever. Enteric Fever.

It is an extremely contagious disease, and its course is short and frequently fatal. The number of deaths arising from all causes in infants under 1 year of age was 416 ; 11 more than in last year. 180 deaths occurred at and above 60; 29 less than the preceding year. 101 inquest deaths were registered in the Parish during the year, 2 more than in 1887; 20 extra parochial inquests upon parishioners were held. 50 deaths occurred from violence, 14 more than last year. In 20 large English towns the mortality in 1888 was:—In London, 18.5; Brighton, 16.1; Portsmouth, 18.8; Norwich, 29.2; Plymouth, 22.3; Bristol, 16.9; Wolverhampton, 20.7; Birmingham, 17.8; Leicester, 18.3; Nottingham, 17.3; Liverpool, 20.3; Manchester, 26.1; Salford, 21.1; Oldham, 20.3; Bradford, 17.1; Leeds, 20.6; Sheffield, 20.5; Hull, 16.4; Sunderland, 18.1; and Newcastle on-Tyne, 20.6. In Edinburgh the mortality was 18; in Glasgow, 22.1; and in Dublin, 25.3. Registered Regulations.—During the year the regulations relating to houses let in lodgings, when the landlord is nonresident, have been carried out. They are very useful in abating nuisances which are not included in the Nuisances Removal Act; but in many cases, the landlords let the houses to one person, who sub-lets, thereby taking the houses from the Register; so really defeating the objects of the Regulations. Slaughter-houses.—These were inspected on November 4th. They were 14; 6 in the Upper Wards, and 8 in the Lower, and kept by the same number of butchers. They were found to be in very good order. 72 Cow-houses.— These were inspected at the same time as the Slaughter-houses. They were 18; 10 in the Upper and 8 in the Lower Wards; and kept by 17 cow-keepers. The number of cows was 167; 80 in the Upper Wards and 87 in the Lower. They were in very good order, and the animals were very fine and healthy. Bake-houses.—These were inspected twice in the year, in May and December. They were 31 in the upper wards, and 26 in the lower; they were generally in very good condition, no nuisance of any kind being found in them, and the terms of the Act were seen to be duly observed. Mortuary. —The utility of the excellent Mortuary is still appreciated. 274 bodies were brought into it during the year. Of these, 95 were for inquest purposes, upon which 44 post morterns were made; 108 were Holborn Union cases; and 71 were brought from the dwellings of parishioners, including 8 cases of Diphtheria, and 5 of Scarlet Fever. In the disinfection of the houses, the streets, the gullies, &c., of the parish, 1,040 gallons of carbolic acid, and 57 cwt. of carbolic powder were used during the year, at a cost of £93 10s. 10d. Except when the weather was frosty, or very wet, the courts, alleys and crowded streets were nearly weekly flushed with carbolic water; the same was also used in watering the roads. Inspectors' Work.—Our active and energetic Inspectors continue to remove a large number of nuisances, as shown below:— Nuisances to which notices have been served, and work done to abate the same for year ending March 25th, 1889:— Wards 1, 2, 3 (Mr. Bartlett's District). 121 water closets provided with water supply. 51 water closets provided with new pans or old pans cleansed. 198 choked and defective drains remedied, including 35 drains reconstructed ; 1490 feet of pipe laid under personal supervision. 136 dirty houses cleansed. 73 77 gully traps provided in lieu of bell traps. 56 defective pavings remedied. 33 dustbins provided or repaired 12 defective roofs repaired. 7 illegal kitchens emptied or made to comply with the Act. 60 cases of overcrowding abated. 1 cesspool abolished 8 accumulations of rubbish removed. 59 defective water supplies remedied. 10 nuisances from keeping animals abated. 7 smoke nuisances remedied. 4 dead bodies removed from rooms where persons live. 9 percolations of water remedied 2 houses condemned as uninhabitable. 1 nuisance from urinal abated. 2 nuisances from fish frying abated. 7 accumulations of dung removed. 77 fumigations after 79 cases of scarlet fever, 9 typhoid and 15 diphtheria. 597 preliminary notices were served. 250 statutory notices were served. 93 notices were served under registered regulations. 11 summonses were taken out under the Metropolis Local ment Act, fines inflicted £35 7s. 4 summonses under the Nuisance Removal Act, costs recovered £2 6s. 1 3 summonses were taken out under the Food and Drugs Act, fines inflicted £17 9s. 2 summonses were taken out under Registered Regulations, fines inflicted £6 8s. 74 Wards 4 and 5 (Mr. Green's District). 29 water closets provided with water supply. 13 diphtheria. 65 scarlet fever. 7 enteric fever. 1 small pox. 80 rooms fumigated and cleansed after infectious disease. 14 accumulations of offensive matter removed. 6 cases of animals kept. 82 cases of overcrowding abated. 58 choked drains unstopped. 18 defective drains repaired. 45 defective pavings repaired. 26 defective roofs repaired. 189 dirty rooms and houses cleansed and repaired. 9 dirty water cisterns cleansed. 37 dustbins repaired. 11 new dustbins provided.

These relations have an important influence upon the mortality of a Parish, for a cold season increases the mortality from Pulmonary Diseases, while a warm one reduces them; and a warm summer increases, while a cold summer reduces the deaths from Diarrhoea.

"The Clerk called attention to the fact that "since the Yestry had ceased to collect the Poor "Rate, which duty had reverted to the Guardians "or Governors of the Poor under the Local Act, "and which Board had been revived for the purpose "in November, 1871, there was no Poor-rate "Account published, except the remainder of those "in collection by the Yestry previous to that time, "and suggested whether it would not be desirable, "by an agreement between both Boards, to publish "the Poor-rate Account of the Guardians or "Governors as an appendix to the Annual Reports "of the Vestry, in which case there would be one "and a half-years, Poor-rate Account to be appended "to the .Report about to be issued for the year "ended Lady-day last. "It was moved by Mr. Bamford, seconded by " Mr. Dore, and— " Resolved that such suggestion be approved " and adopted." (Extract from Board Minutes.) ROBERT PAGET, Yestry Clerk.

COURTS AND BLIND ALLEYS IN CLERKENWELL. REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE, Dated December 16th, 1887. The reference of the Vestry to this Committee of the 9th June last was an instruction "to consider the present condition of the Courts and Blind Alleys in the whole Parish, commencing with No. 5 Ward, and to report thereon." The Committee presume that the Vestry by this instruction intended them to make a searching enquiry into all the conditions of existence in these Courts. The Committee, therefore, have felt themselves directed to enquire not only into actual evils, but also into the modes by which those evils might be remedied. The Committee have personally inspected all the Courts in No. 5 Ward —that is to say, Francis Court including Albion Cottages, Berkley Court, Stratton Place, Eagle Court, Bishop's Court, Aylesbury Place, and Jerusalem Court. They have visited several of the tenements by permission of the occupants, who have in all cases shown themselves ready to assist the Committee in their enquiries; and having thus visited these Courts one by one, the Committee make the following remarks on their condition:— 1. STRATTON PLACE.—A small Court of three houses, entered from Berkley Street by a narrow arched passage, the fronts of the houses separated from the backyards in Berkley Street by a paved strip, and with very small yards behind each house. The two larger houses contained, at the time of our visit, 77 inhabitants, although one room at least was empty. To each house only one w.c. was found. The Court is so pent in between Berkley Street and the narrowest part of St. John's Square as to be almost deprived of light and air. 114 2. FRANCIS COURT includes in a small yard lying off it on the east side two cottages, called Albion Cottages, with one w.c. between them. The Court is a blind alley, only approached from Berkley Street—itself a narrow thoroughfare. All the houses are old, some very dilapidated. No. 2 is closed as unfit for habitation. Backyards to houses small, especially on east side. 3. BERKLEY COURT similarly opens into Berkley Street, and is a blind alley blocked by wall of backyards in Albion Place, containing 15 houses of three storeys, let out in tenements. One house has been shut up for years, the basement had become a receptacle for all kinds of filth, and the owner was traced with difficulty. 4. EAGLE COURT.—Approached from Red Lion Street by a very narrow covered entry, and from St. John's Lane by an archway of sufficient width to admit a cart. Fifteen houses of varying size, of which Nos. 13, 14, 15, and No. 2 are so placed that it is impossible for their inhabitants to obtain a sufficiency of light and air. 5. JERUSALEM COURT is a narrow winding Court, entered from St. John's Square by a covered entry, with block of model dwellings on the north side, which medical men have stated to be very unhealthy, without through ventilation, and such as should never have been built. Air and light are obstructed by an archway under a dwelling house midway in the court. Beyond this archway eastwards are several houses, old, dilapidated, shut out from sufficient air and light by the houses in Albemarle Street, and having once formed part of the large mansions built there more than 200 years ago. 6. AYLESBURY PLACE.—Entered from Aylesbury Street by very narrow arched entry opening through a narrow passage into a wider paved court, closed in on all sides, consisting of 29 small two-roomed houses. 7. BISHOP'S COURT.—Narrow, blind alley, paved, entered from Aylesbury Street, containing about 76 rooms, and a population at the time of the Committee's visit of 180 persons —11 houses exceptionally tall, containing three floors and basement, apparently about 150 years old, and probably from their internal fittings and general decoration intended when 115 built for separate families of the lower middle class. The court is blocked at the south end by a narrow tenement, one story high, but having in the rear the loftier buildings of St. John's Square. The Committee having thus examined the Courts one by one, proceed to offer the following recommendatiions:— I. 1. Stratton Place.—The Committee consider that by reason of the narrow entrance, absence of light and air and through ventilation, this court is entirely unfit for human habitation, and ought to be demolished under the provisions of Torrens' Act. 2. Francis Court.—The Committee are of opinion that the end houses are obstructive of light and air, and that a thoroughfare into Albion Place would give that ventilation which is so necessary. In that case they think that there would be no need to interfere with Albion Cottages, but they would hold their demolition a necessity unless a thoroughfare could be opened up. 3. Berkley Court.—The Committee are likewise of opinion that a thoroughfare should be struck through Berkley Court. 4. Eagle Court.—Here the Committee consider that the archways at both ends should be removed, and a carriage-way made through the court between Red Lion Street and St. John's Lane. 5. Jerusalem Court.—Here the archway leading into St. John's Square and that in the middle of the court should be removed, in the judgment of the Committee. 6. Aylesbury Place.—The Committee think that the entry should be widened, and that a thoroughfare, though not so essential as in the other courts, would be a desirable improvement. 7. Bishop's Court.—The Committee can but advise that the improvement scheme for this court, recommended by the Medical Officer, and adopted by the Vestry on July 17th, 1884, but which was never carried through, should be renewed and prosecuted to an issue. 116 II. A In the course of their enquiries many facts came incidentally to the knowledge of the Committee which seem to show that the people generally are not sufficiently acquainted with the duties of the Sanitary Inspectors, nor with their own rights in matters of sanitation. An especial instance of this is the tact that at the time of the Committee's visits a general impression prevailed that a fee must be paid to the dustmen for emptying the dust bins, the consequence being that these bins were not emptied as often as they should have been. The Committee rccommenb— That in addition to the cards issued, a notice should be affixed in some conspicuous place in every court, stating the days in each week on which the dust bins are to be emptied—that the dustmen, as servants of the Vestry, are forbidden to receive any gratuity for emptying them, and that complaints of incivility or neglect on their part can be made at the Vestry Hall. B The Committee further wommcnb—That the courts be flushed at least once a week throughout the year, weather permitting, and that disinfectants be more freely used. C The Committee are strongly impressed by the necessity of enforcing the new regulations with regard to the number of w.c.'s in each house. As an instance, cases were found in which women stated that they could not use the w.c. The Committee hope that the new Sanitary Regulations will meet this difficulty to a great extent, but they rctommenb—That the Sanitary Inspector take care that the doors of the w.c.'s can be properly fastened on the inside. D The Committee believe that the planting of trees in these courts would be a great advantage both as ornaments and from a sanitary point of view. They mommtnb—That they be planted in the centre of Bishop's Court, Aylesbury Place, Francis Court and Berkley Court, and that if Stratton Place be demolished, its site be utilised for a small garden or open space planted with trees. E Some doubts were expressed by residents in these court whether trees, if planted, would escape destruction. But it seems to the Committee that there would be no fear of injury to them if the inhabitants could be interested in their protection. 117 For this and other reasons the Committee advise that a small committee be formed in each court, from the inhabitants, so as to interest them in preserving the decency, healthfulness, and general better condition of the courts, and that these committees be asked to look after the trees in each court. Each committee should elect one of its members to be headman, who should act as an organ of communication between the dwellers in the court and the Vestry. The Committee noticed the much improved condition of Bishop's Court, owing to the personal supervision of the sub-lessee, under the pressure brought to bear upon him by the Sanitary Committee. But the Committee believe that even these improvements would still leave the courts in a very over-crowded condition. They do not mean that over-crowding exists in the legal sense of the word. This is effectually prevented by the officers of the Vestry. They feel also that a greatly improved state of things may be looked for under the new Sanitary Regulations. Nor are they blind to the difficulties of dealing with this question in Central London, with dwelling space limited, and continually becoming more so, while the demand for accommodation increases. But they find the evils which the Boyal Commission pointed out still in lull force, and until the law is altered they fear inevitably so. They find families condemned to live in close crowded areas, in rooms too small, where moral and physical health must alike be difficult to maintain. Pale, weakly and stunted children, debility unfitting men for work, driving them to drink, and often bringing them on the rates, are the sure results. The Vestry, it may bo. can do little directly to remedy this state of things; but it is bound to watch over the interests of these people, who, although they have no voice in the election of Vestrymen, yet share by their rents in the payment of rates, and the Committee think that a local body like the Vestry might do much by pressing on the Metropolitan Board of Works, on both Houses of Parliament, and on Her Majesty's Government, the melancholy fact that the Report of the Boyal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes has had no practical result. One great difficulty in the way of improved accommodation is the high rent which the wageearning classes have to pay for even insufficient dwelling room. Sometimes the landlord of a tenement house holds of a lease. 9 118 holder, living far away, himself the lessee of a ground landlord, whose very name it is often impossible to ascertain. The Committee much wish that landowners would at least make themselves personally acquainted with the condition of their property if they cannot reside on it for a portion of each year. But they desire emphatically to record their conviction that much misery is caused by the high rents paid by the very poor, and that those rents are swollen by the fact that between the actual owner, and the occupant of rooms in a tenement house, one, and sometimes two, middlemen intervene. All which the Committee beg to submit. On the foregoing Report being presented to the Vestry, it was, in April, 1888, referred to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report. The Sanitary Committee received the following communication from the Medical Officer of Health upon the subject:— To the Sanitary Committee, Gentlemen, In response to your request to me to consider the Report of the Special Committee on Courts and Blind Alleys, I beg to submit the following remarks:— The two Acts under which, in certain cases, unhealthy or illconstructed places can be removed or re-constructed, are the Artizans' Dwellings Act, 1868 (Torrens' Act); and the Artizans' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875 (Cross's Act). I will quote the portions of those Acts which give me power to proceed in these cases. In Sec. 5 of Torrens' Act, it is state 1 that "if in any place to "which this Act applies, the Officer of Health find that any premises "therein are in a condition or state dangerous-rous to health so as to be unfit "for human habitation, he shall report the same in the manner "hereafter provided to the Local Authority." Sec. 3 of Cross's Act states that "where an Official Representation as hereinafter mentioned, is made (by the Medical Officer "of Health) to the local authority, that any houses, courts or alleys 119 "within a certain area under the jurisdiction of the local authority, " are unfit for human habitation, or that diseases indicating a generally "low condition of health among the population have been from time to "time prevalent in a certain area within the jurisdiction of the "local authority, and that such prevalence may be reasonably attributed "to the closeness, narrowness, and bad arrangement or the bad con" dition of the streets and houses or groups of houses within such " area, or to the want of light, air, ventilation, or proper conveniences, " or to any other sanitary defects, or to one or more of such causes, " and that the evils connected with such houses, courts or alleys, "and the sanitary defects in such area, cannot be effectually " remedied otherwise than by an improvement scheme for the rearrangement and re-construction of the street and houses " within such area, or of some of such streets or houses, the " local authority shall take such representation into their consideration, &c." The local authority in this case, is the Metropolitan Board of Works. 1 will examine the question of the individual Courts, &c.;— Stratton Place.—I condemned this Court under Cross's Act in 1875, but the Metropolitan Board of Works did not take up the case. I quite agree with the suggestion of the Special Committee that the Court should be abolished; but it would be hard to state that the premises were in such condition, or so dangerous to health, as to be unfit for habitation. It contains 43 inhabitants, 17 of whom are under 12 years of age. No case of infectious disease has occurred there during the past year. Francis Court.—These houses have back ventilation, back yards, each a separate closet. It is hardly fair to call it a Blind Alley, for it is 14 feet wide throughout, and 102 feet long. The removal of the end houses would be a decided advantage. Berkley Court. —The suggestion of the Committee, that a thoroughfare should be made through the Court, is valuable, if it can be carried out. Eagle Court.—The removal of the archways at both ends would be a great improvement. Jerusalem Court.—The archways here should also be removed. Aylesbury Place.—The widening of the entry would be a very great improvement. 120 Bishop's Court.—The condition of this court has been greatly improved during the last few years. When I condemned it in 1875, the Board of Works did not make a scheme. I think the Board of Works might very well be called upon now to take this court in hand. Now, although I cordially agree with the suggestion of the Committee in regard to removing the obstructive buildings which prevent a free circulation of air, yet I can hardly feel warranted in declaring these courts to be in such condition dangerous to health as to be unfit for habitation. Moreover, the Committee appears to me to have entirely overlooked the consequence of courts being pulled down, and the manner in which they are rebuilt. Consider the instances of Jerusalem Court, Field Place (Frye's Buildings), James' Gardens, and the back tenements of Corporation Buildings. Here the new structures are taller, and more obstructive to light and air than they were before. If the obstructive houses can be pulled down and not re-built, the advantage would be great indeed. The courts will be considerably improved under the new regulations ; the constant water supply has also proved of advantage. In the eight courts examined by the Committee, only one case of infectious disease occurred during the past year, viz., of typhoid fever in Bishop's Court. The Sanitary Committee will recollect that in 1884 I condemned 11 courts in the parish under Torrens' Act. The course of the Act was followed, they were referred to the Surveyor, who reported what was requisite for their improvement. Various improvements were made, and one only was ordered to be closed, viz., Bolton Court. The Visiting Committee did not consider the others were sufficiently badly constructed as to authorize demolition ; and one or two of these were in a far worse state than any of those condemned by the Special Committee. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D. June 15 th, 1888. 121 On the Report of the Sanitary Committee being presented to the Vestry, the following resolutions were passed:— 1. That the Vestry is of opinion that it is desirable that Stratton Place should be demolished, but that its powers are too limited for the purpose. 2. That the removal of the end house of Francis Court would be a decided advantage. 3. That the attention of the Metropolitan Board of Works be called to Berkley Court, Eagle Court, Jerusalem Court, and Aylesbury Place, they being, in the opinion of the Vestry, cases which should be dealt with by a Metropolitan authority, and that the clauses in the Act of 1882, by which the application of Sir Richard Cross's Act in such cases is limited to areas of not less than 10 houses, should be repealed. 4. That it be an instruction to the Surveyor to furnish the Vestry with the probable cost of removing No. 6½, Bishop's Court only, and also of removing the premises, 18. St. John's Square, preparatory to the consideration of the question of the desirability of demolishing same as obstructive buildings. 5. That the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Home Office, be requested to exercise more supervision over plans for new buildings, especially for Artizans' Dwellings and the like, with regard to their sanitary provisions, including light and air. 6. That in addition to the D cards issued, a notice be affixed in some conspicuous place in every Court, stating the days in each week on which the dustbins are to be emptied, and that the dustmen, as servants of the Vestry, are forbidden to demand any gratuity for emptying them, and that complaints of incivility or neglect on their part can be made at the Vestry Hall. 7. That the Courts be flushed once a week during the months of June, July, August and September; once a fortnight during April, May, October and November, and once a month during 122 December, January, February and March, at the discretion of the Medical Officer of Health. 8. That the Sanitary Inspectors take care that the doors of the w.c.'s can be properly fastened on the inside. 9. That the Vestry is of opinion that it is not expedient or practicable to plant and cultivate trees in the Courts as suggested, and that it would be a useless expenditure of money to make the attempt. 10. That copies of the Report on Courts and Blind Alleys as finally adopted, be sent to the members of the Government, the members of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes, all the Metropolitan Members of Parliament, and to the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. Willi regard to the 3rd and 5th of the above resolutions the Vestry received the following reply from the Metropolitan Board of Works:— Metropolitan Board of Works, Spring Gardens, S.W., October 31st, 1888. Sir, The Board has had under consideration your letter, dated 81st July last, stating that the removal of certain obstructive buildings in various courts in the Parish of Clerkenwell appears ta the Vestry to be very desirable in the interest of the health of the inhabitants. Your letter also expresses the opinion of the Vestry that the clause in the Artizans' Dwellings Act Amendment Act, 1882, which limits the jurisdiction of the Board to areas of not less than ten houses, should be repealed, and requests that this Board will exercise more supervision over plans for new buildings, with special reference to their sanitary requirements. In reply I am directed to state that the Board is not prepared to apply to Parliament in the ensuing session for an amendment of the Act of 1882, and any suggestions with that object should, 123 it appears to the Board, be addressed to the Home Secretary. As regards the supervision of plans for new buildings, the Board is, equally with the Vestry, desirous of insisting upon proper sanitary requirements and a due supply of light and air, and will use every endeavour to secure those objects and thus to diminish the evils referred to in your letter. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, J. E. WAKEFIELD, Clerk of the Board. The Clerk of the Vestry of Clerkenwell, Vestry Hall, Rosoman Street, E.C. APPENDIX IV. Proposed People's Palace for Central London. Deputation to the Charity Commissioners. THE PROPOSED PEOPLE'S PALACE FOR CENTRAL LONDON. DEPUTATION TO THE CHARITY COMMISSIONERS. [Islington Gazette, June 23rd, 1888. On Wednesday June 20th, an influential deputation went down to the office of the Charity Commissioners at Whitehall, to ask a grant out of the City Parochial Charities' Fund, for the purposes of providing "Central London" with a people's palace or technical institute. Sir Edmund Currie, Captain Penton, M.P., and Mr. Robert Major Holborn accompanied the deputation, and Mr. Robert Paget (hon. sec. of the scheme) had letters of sympathy with the object, but regret for non-attendance from Col, Duncan, M.P., and Mr. James Rowlands, M.P. The deputation included—from Clerkenwell—the Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A. (Vicar), Mr. Churchwarden J. D. Spires, Mr. A. J. Dixie, Mr. J. Walton, Mr. J. Johnson, and the Rev. W. Dawson. From St. Luke's, the Rev. Mr. Abbott (Rector), Rev. Freeman Wills (Finabury Technical College), Rev. George Smith, Mr. Churchwarden Sharman, Mr. Rumball, and Mr. Easterling. From Holborn, Mr. Bolton, Mr. Hayes, Mr. Brewster, Mr. Emberson, Mr. Maclean, Mr. Wood, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Migotti, and Mr. Hopwood (Vestry Clerk). Captain Penton, M.P., introduced the deputation to Mr. Anstie. Mr. R. Paget handed in the following memorial:— To the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales. The Memorial of the representatives of the Parishes of Central London, Sheweth— That your memorialists represent the local authorities of Clerkenwell, Holborn, and St. Luke's Parishes in Central London, and have in view the establishment for Central London 128 of an institution similar in character to the People's Palace at Mile End, combining means of recreation and technical education. Your memorialists are aware that the Commissioners are now considering the future application of the charitable property or endowments belonging to, or now applicable in, the parishes enumerated in the second schedule of the City of London Parochial Charities' Act, 1883, and that, subject to certain conditions, the two first objects mentioned to which such funds may be applied are— First, to the promotion and education of the poorer inhabitants of the Metropolis, whether by means of exhibitions or of technical instruction, or of secondary education, of art education or evening lectures, or otherwise, as to the Commissioners may seem good; and Second, the establishment and maintenance of libraries or museums, or art collections within the metropolis, under such provisions as may make them useful to the poorer inhabitants thereof. Your memorialists are also aware that in the application of the charitable funds referred to, primary consideration is to be given to the inhabitants of the parishes in which the funds are now applicable, or to persons employed, though not resident, therein. That your memorialists are anxious to co-operate with the other sections of the metropolis, in endeavouring to supply the means of physical, moral, and social improvement to the poorer inhabitants of the community, and in considering the subject, they have had regard to the views expressed by the Charity Commissioners, on the occasion of a deputation waiting upon them, on the 19th January last, to ask for a grant in aid of the proposal to establish free public libraries in the parish of St. Pancras. It was then stated that the object of the Commissioners was to deal with districts more extensive than parishes, and in the report of the Commissioners on this subject, their views are expressed as follows:—"In the Regent Street Polytechnic, and the Beaumont Institute or People's Palace, we have met with institutions which appear, with a remarkable degree of success, to provide for the younger members of the poorer classes, who are beyond the age to which elementary education extends, those means both of health and instruction, and particularly instruction of a technical 129 industrial kind, which are indicated by the Act as suitable objects for the application of the surplus funds." And after referring to proposals to establish similar institutions in South and North London, the report proceeds—" The various proposals thus made seem to point to the propriety of applying a large part of the surplus funds to assist in the establishment throughout the metropolis, of a series of institutions of this nature which, under the regulating influence of the new governing body to be hereafter created under the Act (and to which the management of the general surplus will be entrusted) may be co-ordinated, and thus rendered more efficient and more economical in their administration, and which may extend their influence through other smaller institutions to persons who are not yet, in respect of age or training, competent to participate directly in their benefits." With the above views of the appropriation of a portion of the funds at the disposal of the Commissioners, your memorialists beg to express their cordial concurrence, and they desire to assist in the development of a scheme so broad in its scope and beneficent in its object. The necessities of the metropolis are so vast and varied, and technical instruction in all branches of labour is so desirable, that it is almost unnecessary to dwell upon the special need of such instruction to the workers in the staple trades of Central London, but your memorialists wish to refer to the industries of clock and watch making and working in jewellery, which have made Clerkenwell famous throughout the world, and your memorialists cannot conceive an industry where technical education could be of more value than in those on which so large a proportion of the inhabitants depend for a livelihood. The parishes represented by your memorialists have a population, according to the census of 1881, of 151,988, or say 152,000, on an area of 721 acres, showing a density of 211 persons to the acre. There are other parishes which might be included in Central London, viz., those in the Strand and St. Giles's District, and St. Martin-in-the-Fields, which contain a further population of 95,267, on an area of 698 acres. For this large population means of recreation are exceedingly scanty, the only open spaces being the parks at the extreme west, and Finsbury Park at the extreme north, and a great 130 necessity therefore exists for ample means of recreation being provided in the institution. Your memorialists would further urge that this very crowded population consists largely of the poorer classes supplying labour to the non-resident employers in the City. That in consequence of the great pressure for residences by persons who, from the condition of circumstances, are obliged to live near their work ; the price of land is exceptionally high, and your memorialists will therefore be placed in greater difficulties as to purchasing land than would be the case in the other divisions of the metropolis. Your memorialists, therefore, appeal with confidence for a promise of support, both to the establishment and endowment, from the Charity Commissioners. And your memorialists will ever pray. Dated this 18th day of June, 1883. (Signed) John H. Rose, M.A., Vicar of Clerkenwell, and Chairman of the Conference. Robert Paget, Vestry Clerk of Clerkenwell, and Hon. Secretary to the Conference. The Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A., addressing the Commissioner, said the deputation appeared there on behalf of the central parishes of London—Clerkenwell, St. Luke's, and Holborn— who had sent representatives to a Conference, and finally decided to come to the Commissioners to ask for a grant out of the City Parochial Charities' Fund for a peoples' palace or technical institute. The proceedings of the Conference were embodied in the memorial. The deputation would call attention to the very densely populated part of London which it affected, and yet a part singularly poor in facilities either for instruction or recreation. They had no open space worthy of note. The Commissioner—Clerkenwell Green? (Laughter). The Vicar—But that does not possess a blade of grass, unfortunately. As to instruction, they had no technical schools within their border, and he thought he might say their population was one which specially needed technical instruction. Clerkenwell, St. Luke's, and Holborn had all been famous for watch, clock, and chronometer making. They needed something in the way of technical instruction, and they had, he thought, a claim 131 upon the funds of the Charity Commissioners which they were now dispensing, because they happened to house the poorest of the City folk, who had not the means of going beyond the borders to reside. These people, he submitted, were the natural heirs to this City money, because, were it not for improvements and demolition, they would probably be in actual residence in the City. Clerkenwell, St. Luke's, and Holborn not only housed the poor, but they were very heavily rated, the last returns showing the average rating of the metropolis at 5s. 4d., but Holborn at 5s. Gd.; Clerkenwell, 5s. 7d. ; and St. Luke's, 6s. 3d. [Mr. Easterling—6s. 6d.] That was partially on account of having to keep poor people, who probably would, to a large extent, be relieved by the City charities. He thought they had special need for recreation and instruction in the neighbourhoods indicated, and he thought he might say he was asking the Commissioners to help people who had done something to help themselves. In Clerkenwell they had adopted the Free Libraries' Act, showing that they had done something, and this library would have been an accomplished fact at the present, had it not been for a small obstruction which took them to the Queen's Bench to fight it. However, the promoters had been successful, and he hoped that before long the kind offers of Captain Penton, M.P., and Mr. Holborn would be taken advantage of. Seeing that Clerkenwell had done this, he thought he could ask the Commissioners to help them largely and liberally. (Hear, hear.) Mr. R. M. Holborn followed, saying that he heartily advocated such a scheme which was before them on the grounds that he had acted personally. The core and bulk of the district which had now appealed consisted of Clerkenwell, which contains half of the inhabitants there represented. It was an old proverb that "Providence helps those who help themselves;" and the deputation pleaded that the Commissioners be the providence in this case, because Clerkenwell had taken, as he suggested, the preliminary stages to the technical institute by establishing a free library. Clerkenwell had acted in a singularly noble manner by burdening itself in perpetuity with a penny rate, and with such self-sacrifice, Captain Penton, M.P., and himself had so far sympathised as to give £600 each towards the library. (Hear, hear.) He (the speaker) was but a moderate tradesman, but the Commissioners were the treasurers of education ; and he came there to beg from them, under the feelings upon which he had 132 acted personally. They might laugh at him individually, as representing Gellert's humorous poem of the lame man on the shoulders of the blind, but he entreated the Commissioners to act the part of Hercules in æsop's fable, and help the carter who has put his own shoulder to the wheel. (Hear, hear.) Mr. J. Johnson urged the claims of the deputation, by saying that in central London they had the most skilled workmen, who needed more than any others a technical institute, so as to be able to get access to the best designs to help them in their work. They wanted something for the young workmen, to bridge over the time between leaving school and coming out as workmen on their own responsibility. As a consequence of this need, he believed, much of the trade had been transferred to the more highly-educated workmen of the Continent. But he believed the citizens of Central London only wanted the opportunity and they would recover their lost position. Then there was no doubt they wanted opportunities for physical recreation. With regard to means, he thought they should plead not only for an institute, but also for an endowment; for to give them a building without an endowment would be of little use, because the ratepayers could not bear the taxation to sustain the institute. As shewing the need of the institute for both mental and physical recreation and instruction, he mentioned that at the last census there were 13,000 males between the ages of 15 and 25 years within the area of the Poor Law administration of the Holborn Union, which comprised Clerkenwell, St. Luke's, Holborn and the Charterhouse. Mr. Easterling pleaded on behalf of St. Luke's, saying theirs was the most densely populated of all the districts represented by that deputation. Their ratepayers were poor, and their liabilities heavy; and he thought they might say, with Clerkenwell, that they housed many of the poor who had been driven over the borders from the City ; beside which they had many of the employes in the City. He found, from experience, that they got children in their Sunday Schools and Bands of Hope, but after the ages of 14 or 15 years, they lost the majority of them, because of the need of some inducement to keep them together. It was to supply this want that they asked, in one sense, for the institute similar to that which was so ably conducted in the East End by Sir Edmund Currie. (Hear, hear.) And if recreation and instruction were wanted in the East End, he was quite sure it was needed here. 133 Mr. Hayes, speaking for Holborn, said that district also was poor and densely populated, besides being without proper means of recreation and instruction for the poorer people. Sir Edmund Currie said the raison d'etre of his appearance there that day was because he knew the requirements of the districts mentioned—more especially of St. Luke's—by reason of having been concerned in business there. He knew they were more densely populated even than East London. No one could know the value of the East London Palace better than himself, and no one could feel more grateful for it than he; and he trusted that the deputation of men who had given their lives voluntarily for the good of their fellows, would be successful in what they sought. From his own knowledge of the people of the districts concerned that day, he saw there was something wanting. There was a peculiarity of physique which showed the need for exercise and development which could not be got if the facilities were not provided; whilst, of course, none could over-estimate the value of technical instruction. The Rev. Mr. Abbott said he could not add anything to what Sir Edmund Currie had said, but he could endorse all with regard to the dense population, the poverty, and the great need of physical as well as technical training. There was no doubt the institute was needed, and also an endowment for sustaining the same. A conversation ensued between the deputation and the Commissioner as to the details of their scheme, and the Commissioner intimated that, looking at the map, it would be more convenient to strike out Holborn, and include Clerkenwell and St. Luke's in a general scheme affecting the North and North Eastern districts, such as Islington, Hackney, and Shoreditch. As regarded a site for the building, the Commissioner said this was important; and Mr. Johnson suggested the Charterhouse. The Commissioner in the first place, was not aware that it was for sale; and in the second, that £220,000 was too high a price." The Foresters' Hall," suggested Mr. Johnson; but this, the Commissioner said was already purchased for an institute, which would in no way affect that now asked. He thought the deputation should have formulated some scheme; but Mr. Rumball explained that the deputation did not wait for details, feeling they would be too late in their application. They might get a promise, and then work out the details. The Commissioner said they would have to 134 tbink of their site further towards the "Angel" and Mr. Dixie suggested the Cattle-lairs in St. John Street Road, whilst Mr. Johnson said Sadler's Wells Theatre. The Rev. Mr. Abbott said he would be sorry to see anything put up without a gymnasium, and the Commissioner thought it desirable. But he would like it understood that the Conmissioners had the poorer people in their mind's eye in distributing their money, and that the class of institute would not be on a par with the Finsbury Technical College in Cowper Street. In reply to Sir Edmund Currie, the Commissioner said he should not count the free library as anything off the amount which Clerkenwell would be expected to contribute to the scheme in the event of a grant being made. With regard to the financial aspect of the affair, the Commissioner said undoubtedly the districts represented that day would have to do the same as South London, viz.: offer £ for £ for any grant they got. It was not correct that South London had been given £150,000; the fact being that the Commissioners said they would give up to that amount providing South London found a similar sum. One of the Northern parishes wanted to do something ; but when they heard the terms, they withdrew their application. Captain Penton—But suppose we raised a sum of money which would not be equal to £ for £ for what we should require, would you be willing to give the remainder? The Commissioner said he could not promise. The Rev. Mr. Abbott submitted there was no analogy between South and South West London, and North and North East; because one might be able to pay and the others could not. The Commissioner replied that there were many poor in Lambeth and Battersea, and even St. George's, Hanover Square. The Commissioner said there must be a little more activity shown than in coming to Whitehall and asking for money. Sir Edmund Currie sought to reassure the deputation on the financial point by stating that the money contributed to East London did not come out of East London, but as a result of very systematic and tenacious begging. He had seen what South London was doing, and there the promoters were giving their time and attention to the work ; and he had not the slightest doubt that between now and October, they would be able to get the money. With regard to the position of the institute that would not so much matter, because he had people coming two or three miles to the People's Palace. There was not so much difficulty in getting the first cost as the endowment, and this he 135 thought the Commissioners would assist in giving. The Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A., in thanking the Commissioner, said Clerkenwell was quite prepared to do something to put their shoulders to the wheel; but now he understood they had to approach Islington, and St. Pancras, and Hackney, and obtain their concurrence to the general scheme. The Commissioner said this was so; and The deputation withdrew. CLERKENWELL FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY. LONDON. FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS. 1888-9. LONDON: T.

The Commissioners in presenting their first annual report desire to place on record a brief statement as to the progress made in the organisation of the Library since the adoption of the Public Libraries' Acts, by the ratepayers of Clerkenwell in December, 1887. The Commissioners were elected by the Vestry on January 26th, 1888, and their first meeting was held immediately thereafter. At this meeting the Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A., Vicar of the parish, was appointed chairman, and Mr. Wm. Robson, honorary secretary to the Commissioners, pending the appointment of a Librarian. A delay of five months was caused by the action of certain parishioners who challenged in the Law Courts the validity of the vote whereby the Libraries' Acts were adopted, and it was not until an unreserved decision had been given in favour of the Commissioners, that they were enabled to proceed with their labours. The promoters of the movement for the adoption of the Libraries' Acts were greatly aided and strengthened by the valuable assistance given them by Robert Major Holborn, Esq., of Islington, and Captain F. T. Penton, M.P., who each promised gifts amounting to £600; and it is unquestionably due in a great measure to the generosity displayed by these gentlemen that the library was successfully started. With such substantial help the Commissioners were able to commence their work, and as a preliminary step they hired a vacant house at No. 19, Tysoe Street, for use as Temporary Premises. Their next step was to advertise for a Librarian and Secretary, and out of 90 applicants they unanimously appointed Mr. James D. Brown, Assistant-Librarian in the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, who entered upon his duties in October, 1888. Mr. Robson, who, up to this date, had 6 acted as honorary secretary, was then unanimously elected vice-chairman by his colleagues. Meanwhile the question of a permanent Library building had been under the consideration of the Commissioners,and after various negotiations they received from the Worshipful Company of Skinners the offer of a site on terms which can only be regarded as favourable in the extreme. The Company agreed to let on lease for 80 years a plot of ground at the junction of Skinner and Whiskin Streets, extending to over 3000 superficial feet, at an annual rental of forty shillings. The Commissioners accepted this offer with the utmost pleasure, as it furnished them with a good central and accessible site at a nominal charge, and relieved them from a large portion of the expense preliminary to the building of a suitable Library; and they now place on record their high sense of the Company's generosity and interest in the well-being of the inhabitants of Clerkenwell. It was decided to open a news-room in the ground-floor of the temporary premises, 19, Tysoe Street, pending the arrangements for a permanent home for the Library, and on November 20th, 1888, at 5 o'clock, this was done. There had been an informal ceremonial earlier in the day to mark the occasion, and at this Captain Penton, M.P., R. M. Holborn, Esq.; Herbert E. Draper, Esq, and E. H. Burnell, Esq., representatives of the Skinners' Company, and other donors attended and wished prosperity to the Library. Since its opening the Newsroom has been so successful as to justify the hope, that, in more spacious and adequate premises the Free Library will ultimately become the most popular and cherished institution in the parish. The staff are now actively engaged in the preparation and cataloguing of nearly 10,000 volumes of popular works for the Lending Library, which will be available for the use of the inhabitants in a few weeks. For further details of the work thus far accomplished by the Commissioners, reference must be made to the lists and other particulars furnished as an appendix to this report. In conclusion the Commissioners express the hope that in the course of a few months the inhabitants of Clerkenwell 7 will see reared in their midst a Library Building worthy oi the district, having large News and Reading Rooms, and collections of books for free consultation and home reading, including a Reference Library containing books of a technical character, which will prove of the greatest value to all students and working men, and especially to those connected with the staple industries of Clerkenwell. For the Commissioners, JOHN H. ROSE, Chairman. Jan. 1889. APPENDIX. Since its opening on November 20th, 1888, the small, temporary newsroom in connection with the Library has been attended with a very gratifying amount of success. The attendance of readers has been steady, and the accommodation available has very frequently been overtaxed. The class of readers frequenting the room comprises persons of all kinds, and the majority of them obviously visit the Library for useful purposes, as is evidenced by the fact that the higher class periodicals, magazines and technical journals are chiefly read. During the 10 days in November on which the newsroom was open, 1925 readers visited the room. For the 24 days open in December, 4414 readers attended ; and in January, 1889, on 22 days, 4959 readers attended. The total number of visitors for the 56 days during which the newsroom was open amounted, therefore, to 11,298, or a daily average of 202. Of these 223 were ladies. The arrangements for opening a Lending Department in the present premises are being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and it is anticipated that it will be available for public use in a few weeks from this time. A List of Donors and Donations during 1888 is added, together with a list of the various journals and magazines now to be seen in the newsroom. JAMES D.
