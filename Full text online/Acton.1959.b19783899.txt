To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. I submit my Annual Report on the health of the Borough of Acton for the year 1959. The population figure as estimated by the Registrar General showed a slight decline from 65,840 to 65,360. The population has shown a steady decrease since 1954 when the figure was 67,640. The birth rate of 15.2 was the highest for ten years. The infant mortality rate fell to 19.2 compared with a figure of 22.0 for England and Wales, and the still birth rate of 12.3 was considerably lower than the figure of 21.0 for the country. I append below a table showing the deaths that have occurred due to cancer of the lung and bronchus. 3 DEATHS FROM CANCER OF THE LUNG AND BRONCHUS— 1952 to 1959 Year Total 25—45 45—65 65 + Bronchus Lung Bronchus Lung Bronchus Lung M.

The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service provides a Pathological Service at the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens submitted for examination. Type No. of specimens examined Throat and Nose Swabs 152 Sputum 19 Faeces 240 Hair, Widals, etc. 5 Milk 116 Milk Bottles 23 Water 77 Ice-Cream 168 HOSPITAL PROVISION The Regional Hospital Board of the N.W. Metropolitan Area, which includes Acton, is responsible for hospital treatment of the sick. The most difficult cases for which to obtain treatment are old persons or chronic sick who become acutely ill or who are in the terminal stage of their illness. These types of cases need continuous care and treatment, and it is just these requirements which cannot be met in the home. 13 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Under Section 47 of this Act power is given to the Councils of County Boroughs and County Districts to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for removal and detention, in a suitable hospital or other place, of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions; and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. Application is made to the Court only as a last resort, and in several cases which came to my notice during the year it was possible, either to persuade the persons concerned to enter a hospital or home voluntarily, or to provide home help, nursing and other local services so that they could remain in their own homes. Under Section 50 of this Act the Borough Council arranged for the burial of 8 persons where no other provision was being made. PUBLIC HEALTH LAUNDRY SERVICE The Public Health Laundry Service was commenced in November 1955 under the powers of Section 84 of the Public Health Act 1936, to assist incontinent old persons and to relieve them or their relatives of the burden of washing soiled linen. The service is running smoothly and the number of cases dealt with weekly fluctuated between 20 and 30. There is no doubt that a service of this kind is of great value to the community. Commercial launderies will not accept articles in the condition dealt with under the Council scheme, and the relief is greatly welcomed by patients and relatives. It is certain that in some cases relatives would be unable to cope with these incontinent old people and removal to hospital would be necessary. I give below details of the cases dealt with during 1959. Number of cases dealt with 71 Number of cases died 22 Number of cases removed to hospital 20 Number of cases where other arrangements made – Number of collections 1478 14 SECTION C HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL AMBULANCE FACILITIES The Middlesex County Council is responsible for this service. NURSING IN THE HOME This service is administered locally by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care in Acton during the year was 917 necessitating 32,267 visits. CHILD WELFARE CLINICS The average attendances per session for the five Child Welfare Clinics are given below, last year's figures being shown in brackets. Avenue Road 4 sessions weekly 26.0 (28.6) Trinity Way 2 sessions weekly 32.5 (32.7) Cloister Road 2 sessions weekly 28.3 (25.8) Steele Road 2 sessions weekly 31.2 (28.1) Pierrepoint Road 4 sessions weekly 32.0 (28.3) Total number of children who first attended the clinics during the year, and who, on the date of their first attendance were: — Under one year of age 1,051 Between the ages of one and five 79 15 Total number of children who attended during the year, and who, at the end of the year were:— Under one year of age 890 Over one year 2,030 Total number of attendances at Clinics during the year:— By children under one year of age 14,346 By children between one and five years 6,800 Number of visits during the year by all Health Visitors working in this area:— To expectant mothers—First visits 487 Total visits 855 To children under one year of age—First visits 1,153 Total visits 4,769 To children between the age of one and five years—Total visits 6,000 MIDWIFERY SERVICE Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. Only 19% of the total births were home confinements. The bulk of the hospital confinements were accepted at Central Middlesex and Queen Charlotte's Hospitals, the table below giving the distribution:— Central Middlesex Hospital 36.0% Queen Charlotte's Hospital 28.8% Hammersmith Hospital 4.0% Chiswick Hospital 5.7% Other Hospitals 6.1% Nursing Homes 0.4% Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's midwives attending) 19.0% 16 ANTE NATAL CLINIC In July 1959 we commenced a weekly, instead of fortnightly, Ante-Natal Clinic at Pierrepoint Road and transferred the Trinity Way session to Friday to fit in alternately with Cloister Road. Avenue Road Wednesday afternoons. Cloister Road Alternate Friday mornings. Pierrepoint Road Wednesday mornings. Trinity Way Alternate Friday mornings. The following table shows the number of attendances made throughout the year:— Number of new cases attending during the year 572 Total number who attended during the year 731 Total number of attendances made 2,501 Average number who attended per session 177 POST-NATAL CLINICS There were no specific post-natal clinics as the majority of patients return to hospital for this examination. The domiciliary cases who had been attended by Queen Charlotte's Midwives also attended the post-natal clinic at the hospital. Three only attended the local ante-natal clinic for their post-natal examination. ANTE-NATAL EXERCISES Avenue Road One session weekly. Pierrepoint Road Two sessions weekly. 177 new patients were taken on during the year and there was a total of 1,120 attendances, an average of 7.5 per session.

One afternoon and one evening clinic weekly were held at Trinity Way, East Acton. One new patient was referred for advice in 1959. HOME HELP SCHEME At the end of the year there were 9 full-time Home Helps, and 61 part-time Staff. 18 SECTION D INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES, SCABIES AND OTHER CONDITIONS DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION The protected child population at the end of 1959 is as follows: Children under 5 years of age 2,359 Children 5-15 years 8,313 and the figures of work carried out during 1959 are given below: Total number of under 5s inoculated 368 Total number of over 5s inoculated 14 Boost dose after 3 years 167 Schick Test after 3 years—Negative 86 Positive 15 Primary Schick Test—Negative 5 Positive 9 POLIOMYELITIS VACCINATION During the year an encouraging response built up in the local factories and industrial units for protection of the "Up to 25's" against poliomyelitis, and by the end of December 1959, of some 5,(MM) young people who had received their first two injections earlier in the year, 1,800 had completed the course of three inoculations. Much of the work was carried out at the place of employment, thanks to the excellent co-operation of managements and medical staffs, but where medical facilities were not available our own staff visited and gave the injections at the specified intervals. Special evening and regular Saturday morning sessions were also held at the Clinics to give every opportunity to young adults to avail themselves of this protection. INFECTIOUS DISEASES During the year 864 cases of infectious diseases were notified 19 compared with 399 during 1958. Of the total notifications 711 were in respect of measles, compared with 172 last year. Poliomyelitis It will be noted that no cases of poliomyelitis were confirmed. One case was notified but was subsequently diagnosed as Infective Polyneuritis. Food Poisoning Thirty-four cases of food poisoning or suspected food poisoning were notified, but only nine of these were confirmed. Four cases were due to salmonella Newport and 5 to salmonella typhi-murium. '20 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR (Corrected).

During the year 29 persons were treated for dirty heads. Twenty of these were referred for treatment by the medical staff of factories within the Borough. Two persons were treated for scabies and one person for body lice. 23 SECTION E HOUSING I am indebted to the Borough Engineer for the following information showing the progress made since the end of the war. Temporary Prefabricated Dwellings. Occupied 31.12.59 206 New Permanent Dwellings. (1) Within the Borough: Completed and occupied 31.12.59 1,208 (2) Outside the Borough: Completed and occupied 31.12.59 435 SECTION F SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. Waste of water has been notified to the Metropolitan Water Board on 21 occasions and, in addition to saving a measure of water supply, these notifications have been the means of preventing nuisance from dampness in many cases. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and in the course of the year a total of 27 samples were submitted to the Council's analyst or pathologist for examination as to chemical or bacteriological content, and the results generally indicated a satisfactory supply. 24 PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS The only public swimming baths in the borough are the 1st and 2nd class baths provided by the Council at Winchester Street. The water is obtained from a deep well on the premises and is subject to continuous filtration and chlorination, the baths contents being completely treated every 4 hours. During the year 50 samples of baths water were submitted for bacteriological examination and all proved satisfactory. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are connected to the sewerage system which discharges, by an arrangement with the L.C.C., into the London sewers. Stormwater is filtered and emptied into the Thames. PUBLIC CLEANSING The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1959 was 14,704 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 3,914 tons. All was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 1,772 tons of salvage were sold. RODENT CONTROL Test baiting of public sewers and treatment as necessary have been maintained and this work contributes largely to the improved conditions in the matter of infestation on the surface. The services of the Council's Rodent Destruction staff continue to be divided between work of destruction of newly discovered rats and mice by intensive treatment and regular visitation and examination of business premises to prevent infestation. The Borough is free from serious infestation. Investigation, destruction and maintenance have entailed a total of 5,758 visits by the Rodent Operatives, 1,743 to business premises and 4,015 to dwellings, in addition to inspections by the Public Health Inspectors as noted elsewhere. 25 RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 19S1 Under the above Act, seventeen premises are registered for the manufacture of articles of upholstery, toys, etc., and three premises were licensed for the storing of rag flock. In the course of inspections it has been noted that rag flock and other filling materials are stored and used under hygienic conditions. COMPLAINTS The number of complaints registered at the counter was 881 and by letter 178. INSPECTION OF FACTORIES The number of factories in the Borough is 690 and these have been subject to inspection by the Public Health Inspectors to ascertain that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and regulations as to sanitary accommodation are complied with. The usual work of inspection of factory canteens has been maintained, and advice given as necessary as to fitness or otherwise of food for human consumption. The home addresses of 79 outworkers engaged in work at home for Factories within and outside the Borough, have been visited to ascertain hygienic conditions and freedom from infectious disease. 26 FACTORIES ACT, 1937 PART I OF THE ACT 1.

Inspections of registered food premises are carried out from time to time and further action taken as necessary to ensure the premises and method of production being maintained at a satisfactory standard. Members of the Public Health Inspectors staff from time to time give lectures with film strip displays to stimulate and maintain interest in food hygiene and the general work of the Public Health Department. FOOD INSPECTION Reference to special examinations of consignments of food follow in this section of the report and while details of the quantity condemned are noted, it is not practicable to collate total quantities. The amount of food-stuffs surrendered owing to deterioration or damage is largely related to the extensive work of food manufacture and distribution in the Borough. There are two large wholesale grocery Depots within the Borough, and hence surrenders of canned and packeted goods are made to this Authority; these surrenders constitute the major part of such foodstuff noted. The following list collated for convenience shows some details of the surrendered food-stuffs: Bacon 423 lbs. Cream 24 tins Fish, wet 4 stone „ tinned 990 tins shell 226 33 Flour and Flour Products 2 pkts. ,, ,, 83 tins Fruit, tinned 18,851 tins „ dried 3,770 lbs. ,, flavouring 8,088 tubes Ham, tinned 115 lbs. „ 25 lbs. Meat:— Fresh 19,665 lbs. Tinned 1,414 tins Corned beef 243 tins Offal 317 tins ,, 60 lbs. Milk, Condensed 845 tins Pastes, Pickles, etc. 240 jars Poultry:— Chickens 416 lbs. Preserves 241 tins Puddings, sweet and savoury 368 tins Soup, Strained Foods, etc. 377 tins Sausages 116 tins Vegetables 2,121 tins Miscellaneous 71 jars, etc. 26 lbs. DISPOSAL OF CONDEMNED FOOD There has been no change in the methods of disposing of condemned and surrendered food noted in the report. At the large slaughterhouse and bacon factory in the Borough all diseased or infected carcases, and parts of carcases, are destroyed in special plant producing inedible material — bone meal, fertiliser, etc. — under supervision of the Council's Meat Inspectors. Apart from condemned food material dealt with at these slaughterhouse premises all surrendered diseased, or unsound, food is disposed of for animal feeding purposes, or otherwise as appropriate. 34 FOOD COMPLAINTS There were 35 complaints as to unsound food, etc., and in 2 cases the Council instituted legal proceedings. Details are as follows:— Date of Hearing 10.4.59 11.12.59 Offence Hydro-carbon oil in evaporated milk Mould in Apple Puff Result Fined £10. Costs £8.10.6. Fined £5. Costs £5.5.0. MILK There are only two dairies in the Borough and the practice of distributing milk wholesale in bottles from large bottling depots to local depots, for delivery by roundsmen, or over the counter in milk shops remains. 116 samples of milk were taken throughout the Borough and following submission to the Pathological Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, the results of the bacteriological examinations indicated that generally satisfactory conditions of processing and storage were maintained. The wholesale, pasteurising and bottling centre in Bollo Lane has continued in operation without cause for complaint, and 23 empty bottles taken from the filling lines for examination as to sterility, were found to be sterile. The following licences were granted under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasturised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1953, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954. Dealers' Licences:— Tuberculin Tested Milk 18 Pasteurised Milk 42 Sterilised Milk 32 35 Supplementary Licences:— Tuberculin Tested Milk 13 Pasteurised Milk 14 Sterilised Milk 13 132 ICE-CREAM The number of manufacturers of ice-cream in the Borough is now 4. Each of them is equipped to produce pasteurised ice-cream, and production is in every way in accord with the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947/1952. There are 151 premises where ice-cream is not manufactured, but where the commodity is sold in the main from pre-packed stocks. During the year 268 samples were taken, 162 of ice-cream manufactured in the Borough, and 106 from shops or itinerant vendors trading in icecream manufactured outside the Borough. The high bacteriological standard reflected in the results of examination of samples of ice-cream, together with inspection of plant and premises, has shown that processing and storage conditions are satisfactory and well maintained. MEAT INSPECTION The continued increase in the number of animals killed at Messrs. T. Wall and Sons' slaughterhouse has necessitated the permanent attendance of a larger staff from the Local Authority and this, together with the increased amount of overtime spent there, has had an effect on the other activities of the department. 36 CARCASES AND OFFAL INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED IN WHOLE OR IN PART — 1959 Pigs 1.

Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk 103 1 Butter 17 Cakes and Biscuits 4 2 Cheese 8 Cream 17 Drugs 25 — Fish and Fish Products 15 Fruit 9 — Ice Cream 23 — Liver 11 — Margarine 10 — Meat and Meat products 22 — Sausages 7 — Soft Drinks 1 — Spirits 1 — Sweets 7 — Vinegar 13 — Miscellaneous 8 — 301 3 Milk The milk sample shown as unsatisfactory was 1 churn of a consignment sent into a processing dairy in Acton and was slightly deficient in milk fat. The standard achieved of a bulked sample was satisfactory and no action was therefore taken. Cakes and Biscuits Two samples of cakes described as "cream" were found to be manufactured with imitation cream, and the suppliers were sent an official caution in respect of these offences. 39 MERCHANDISE MARKS ACTS, 1887-1953 Most of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts is to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders (which relate to the indication of the country of origin of certain goods) are properly observed. 170 premises were visited and a total of 581 stacks and displays of foodstuffs were examined for compliance with the Orders. THE LABELLING OF FOOD ORDER, 1953 This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of packer or labeller (or with a registered trade mark); and also to bear on the label its common or usual name together with a list of ingredients of which it is composed. The Order also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals are disclosed. 188 premises were visited and 731 articles of food examined. SAFE MILK During the year 8 samples of raw milk were procured and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli and 50 samples of pasteurised or sterilised milk were procured and tested for proper processing. All were satisfactory. ADVERTISING AND LABELLING INFRINGEMENTS Food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false and misleading statements and descriptions. Examples where corrective action was sought and obtained were fruit syrups described as fruit juices, slimming claims in association with lemon juice drinks, and a seedless fig bar which contained fig seeds. Extravagant claims in respect of medical remedies were challenged and the advertisements withdrawn. 40 SECTION H DISEASES OF ANIMALS Throughout the year, the Borough remained free from any outbreak of notifiable disease. SECTION I SMOKE CONTROL AREAS During the year, the inspections of Acton Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Smoke Control Orders were completed and the Orders were made by the Council and submitted to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. The details of the proposed Smoke Control Order No. 4 were also submitted to the Ministry for approval. SECTION J ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION There has been no major change in the siting or recording of the three deposit gauge and seven lead peroxide stations and analyses have been maintained throughout the year. ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY THE LEAD PEROXIDE METHOD The monthly figures for each station for the years 1958 and 1959 are shown on page 41 and the 1959 figures are illustrated graphically on page 42. The station with the highest monthly figure—4.2 and with the highest average figure—2.7 was Bashley Road. The station with the lowest monthly figure—0.3—and with the lowest average figure—1.6—was Acacia Road. The average of all stations for the year was 1.95 which is slightly below that of the previous year. DEPOSIT GAUGES The monthly figures for each station are shown statistically on page 43 and graphically on page 42. The yearly average figure—13.81 tons/sq. mile—has fallen slightly compared with that of the previous year although the amount of combustible material in the deposit has again increased by a small amount. Once again the station with the greatest monthly deposit— 22.5 tons/sq. mile — and the greatest average deposit — 15.97 tons/sq. mile — was Bashley Road. The Kendal Avenue gauge showed the lowest monthly deposit of 8.42 tons/sq. mile and the lowest average deposit of 12.57 tons/sq. mile. 41 ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY LEAD PEROXIDE INSTRUMENTS Weight of S03 in Milligrams per 100 Square Centimetres per day.
