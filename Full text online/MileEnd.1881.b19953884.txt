The Vestry again present a tabular statement of the number meetings during the year ending the 25th March, 1882, from which it will be seen that equal attention is given to the business of the parish as in former years. It is as follows:— MEETINGS. YEAES. REMARK. 1878-9. 1879-80. 1880-81. 1881-82. Vestry 20 25 23 22 Excluding the Weekly Meeting of Dusting and Cleansing Committee at the Stables. Standing Committees 89 93 111 100* Special „ 57 28 14 4 Totals 166 146 148 126 Death has been very busy among members of the Vestry Deaths, during the past year, and the Vestry have to deplore the loss of Messrs. Doubell, H. C. L. Hart, J. Fordham, H. Preece, and Dr. Swyer. The Vestry must make particular remark that Mr. Preece was a member of the first Vestry of this Hamlet elected under the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and had been an active worker in parochial matters ever since. The Vestry Clerk, Mr. Thompson, also died during the year. Consequent upon Mr. Thompson's death, there have been several changes in the Vestry staff. Mr. Henry Coningham, the Assistant Clerk to the Vestry, was appointed Vestry Clerk; Mr. Edward Hall, the Messenger, was appointed Assistant Clerk to the Vestry, vice Coningham, at a salary of £200 per annum, and Mr. Alfred Greeves was elected Messenger in Mr. Hall's place, at a salary of 25/- per week. Appointment of Officers. The Vestry have, during the year, again fully considered the duties and emolument of the Superintendent of Labor; and, acting on the recommendation of the Dusting and Slopping Committee, have increased his salary £25, making it now £200 per annum. Salary of Superintendent of Labor. 8 Parliamentary. The Parliamentary Committee of the Vestry have had under their consideration the Bills which have been brought before Parliament, mentioned in the following list. In cases where the Vestry have considered it necessary to take any steps with regard thereto, such steps are mentioned in the last column opposite to the name of the Bill. No Subject Matter. Nature of Steps Taken. Session Municipal Corporation Act (Amendment) 1881. 1 2 Thames River 3 London City Parochial Charities Petition in favour. 4 Metropolitan Commons Supplemental Petition against. 5 Metropolitan Open Spaces Act Amendment ,, for Amendment. 1882.

One of the most important of these Bills was the Riverside Fish Market, which directly affected the Hamlet, as it was proposed to alter certain streets. The Vestry from the first approved of the objects in view, but as no proper provision for 9 the protection of the Vestry's interests had been inserted, the Vestry were compelled to petition against the Bill, but particularly limited themselves to obtain clauses. So soon as the clauses for the protection of the Vestry's interests have been obtained the Vestry will petition in favor of the Bill, and the Vestry have every hope that the long-felt need of a larger fish market will be obtained. The various Bills authorising companies to supply electricity would also have greatly affected the interests of the ratepayers if allowed to pass as proposed, and the Vestry accordingly petitioned against each and all and that the subject might be dealt with by one bill, and there is little doubt but that the government will deal with the subject. Electric Lighting Bill The Vestry are pleased to be able to report that the price of gas to the public lamps has again been reduced and the price as from 31st December 1881, is £3 19s. 6d. per lamp. Gas to Public Lamps. The Vestry, having been called upon by the Great Eastern Railway so to do, have paid their proportion of £500 towards the cost of widening the bridge over Grove Road. The making up of the roadway and foot-paths at that spot was put to public tender, and Mr. J. J. Griffith's tender for £592 was accepted, and the work has been completed. Grove-rd. Bridge. The Vestry cannot but feel that one of the most useful improvements in this part ot London has thus been effected at a comparatively small cost to the ratepayers. If the number of complaints alone formed a criterion of how the new system of doing the dusting and slopping has worked, there is no doubt but that it has proved a success, but the Vestry feel bound to say that the cost of the work also bears favourable comparison with former years. Dusting and Slopping. During the year, Leslie Street, Cecil Street, Mossford Street, and Eric Street have been made up at the expense of the owners. Some of the property was of a small class, and the owners find it difficult to provide the sum demanded, but there is little doubt but that by shewing leniency, the Yestry will ultimately succeed in getting in nearly all the amounts. Paving at expense of Owners Albert Koad has been re-named Moody Street, and the houses re-numbered. This is the only case actually carried out during the }'ear, but the Vestry have made suggestions to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the orders to be made with regard to several other streets. Re-naming and Re-numbering Streets. Repairs of Roads by Public Companies. 10 The Vestry have again had considerable difficulty in getting the Gas and Water Companies to properly reinstate the roads after they have made openings. On the present occasion they have to say that the Commercial Gas Company has been the greatest offender, but the Vestry hope that ultimately the Companies will see that it is to their own interest to at once thoroughly restore the road as required, rather than have continually to keep making good defects. Walls at ends of streets loading to Regent's Canal.. From time to time numerous complaints have been made to the Vestry of the insecure nature of the fences between the ends of some of the streets bordering on the Regent's Canal, and the canal itself, and the consequent frequent immersions of children and deaths from drowning. The Vestry, after careful consideration of the facts, thought it was within their 'province to act, and accordingly resolved to build walls across the ends of two of the streets, and the Vestry have every reason to believe that the Canal Company will contribute towards the cost of so doing. Artizans and Laborers'Dwel lings Act. The Vestry has again had to put in force the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, in the following cases:— Nos. r to 6, Weybridge Place; ,, 1 to 9, Upper York Place ; ,, 100 and 102, Harford Street; „ 1 to 24, Pedley's Orchard; ,, 1 to 3, on the right-hand side of court leading to Pedley's Orchard. Upon enquiry it seems that most of the persons taking the rack rents have but very short terms to run. In the first-mentioned cases it has been arranged that the property shall be pulled down, whilst in the others the tenants will be removed, and the houses shut up, or works will be executed which will prevent the places from being dangerous to the health of the inhabitants although not altogether what could be wished. The houses, as may be judged, are inhabited by a class of persons who can pay but little rent, and if they were turned out would, in many instances, be homeless. The Vestry feel, however, that they have a duty to perform, and must not allow places to exist which may become a centre for infectious diseases, and they hope that they will succeed by the manner in which they act. 11 After the close of the last year, applications were received from Drs. Loane and Atkins, (two of the Medical Officers of the Guardians), and from the Relieving Officers, asking for some remuneration for the services performed by them for the Vestry during the Small Pox epedemic, and the Vestry granted to each of the Medical Officers named £5 5s. od., and to each of the Relieving: Officers £3 3s. od. Small-pox epidemic, 1880. The Metropolitan Board of Works having determined under the powers given to them, to construct a storm overflow sewer, for the purpose of relieving the existing sewer during times of storm, the Vestry thought it would be a convenient time, and save expense, if that Board would, whilst constructing the overflow sewer, lower the level of the existing sewer, so as to enable the Vestry to alter the sewers under its control, and so secure a better system of drainage in some parts of the Hamlet. The Vestry accordingly Memorialized the Metropolitan Board on the subject, but that Board declined to do as asked, stating that in their view it would be better to await the experience of the overflow sewer. Floodings. In connection with the repairs of the Vestry Hall, it was mentioned in the last Report that a large claim for extras had been sent in. The amount of extras so claimed was £gj 4s. 4d., but after considerable negociation the contractor accepted £50 in full discharge of all claims. Ve3try Hall. The Vestry are sorry to have to report that they have again been engaged in an expensive litigation, which has, at present, proved adverse to the Vestry, but which involves such serious questions that the Vestry feel it incumbent upon them to take it to the Court of Appeal. The facts of the case are very simple. The Plaintiff was going home from work two days after the memorable snow storm of the 18th January, 1881, and when passing along Charles Street, it is alleged he slipped on the iron plate forming the cover to the water meter box, which by wear had become smooth. The Plaintiff alleges, that allowing it to become smooth, is negligence which renders the Vestry liable. The Vestry contend that it is not negligence, and that even if it be, the Vestry put it in its place and own it in their capacity as Surveyors of Highways, and that therefore they are not liable upon the well established law, that Surveyors of Highways are not liable for non-feasance, but only for mis-feasance. Blackmore v. The Vestry. 12 The jury found that the state of facts showed negligence, and gave a verdict for £154 damages, and the judge allowed costs. The Vestry hope, upon the law of the case, to get the verdict set aside. If they are not able to do so, the consequences will be very serious to the ratepayers of London and other large towns where similar coverings are in use, as there is little doubt but that many fictitious claims will be made which it will be most difficult if not impossible to disprove. Communications over Thames East of London Bridge. The very important question of further means of communication between the north and south of the Thames, below London Bridge, has again been gone into by the Vestry, and they have arrived at the conclusion that some such communication is absolutely necessary. The Vestry fully appreciate the fact that the carrying out of the scheme may affect some particular class or classes, but at the same time they consider that what is the most beneficial for the general public must prevail over merely personal interests. The Vestry do not urge any particular form of communication' but they have communicated to the Metropolitan Board of Works their opinions, and have urged that body to take steps to procure Parliamentary powers to carry out the work in such way as may deemed most advantageous to all. Sanitary work. There have not been any sewer or drainage works of very great magnitude executed during the year, but at the same time many smaller but most useful ones, in a sanitary point of view, have received attention. Line of Frontage in Commercl.-rd, The Vestry had brought to their notice the fact that Mr. Sullivan, of Commercial Road, is in the habit of enclosing the pent-house in front of his house with shutters, and so practically making it a building, and they accordingly requested the certificate of the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works as to whether it was in advance of the general line of buildings . He certified that it was, and the Vestry thereupon summoned Mr. Sullivan for erecting a building in advance of the general line without the consent of the Metropolitan Board of Works. After a lengthy hearing, the magistrate, in giving his decision, stated in effect that, as regarded the pent-house, it had existed so long, that the certificate of the Superintending Architect would not affect that, and therefore that the whole question was, Does the putting up of shutters at night make it become a building In his opinion it did not, and therefore he dismissed the 13 summons with costs, but intimated that if anything of a permanent character were put up it would alter the case. It will be requisite, therefore, to keep a sharp look out so that the owner of the premises does not do anything which may ultimately give him a right to have a permanent enclosure. The Vestry have, they believe, enumerated the most important works which have happened during the year, but they beg to refer to the reports of their several principal officers for the details of many others of considerable importance though of less magnitude. The question of the expenditure of the Parish, is one which, of all others, excites the most interest. Financial. Over the poor-rate the Vestry have really no control, although it is submitted to the Vestry and approved. The poor-rate shews an increase, being 2s. 6d. in the pound this year, as against 2S. 4d. last year, and 2s. 3d. in the two previous years. The General, Lighting, and Sewers Rates are those by which the funds required for Vestry purposes are raised, but as has been pointed out in previous Reports, the School Board Precept has to be paid out of the General Rate. Poor Rale. The Vestry have made calls, which make the General Rate equal to 1s. 8d. in the £. Lighting „ „ os. 3d. „ Sewers ,, „ os. 3d. „ Making a total equal to 2s. 2d, ,, For the purpose of arriving at the Vestry's own expenditure, it is requisite to find out to what the School Board Precept is equal. The Vestry find that For the first half of the year the Precept was £4230 6 3 For the second half 4118 17 7 Making a total of £8349 310equal to 6½d.in the £ If the 6½d. be deducted from the is. 8d. General Rate it will leave is. 1½d. in the £ as the amount required by the Vestry itself for general purposes, and would make the total amount for all purposes required by the Vestry itself equal to a rate of 1s. 7½d. in the £, which is less than last year. General, Lighting and Sewer Rate. 14 The following comparative statement shews the annual amount in the £ to which the Vestry's Precepts would have amounted during these last eight years, if the Vestry had had only to call for the amounts required by itself. In 1874 the expenditure 1s.8din the £ was equal to 1876 ,, 1. 8d. ,, 1877 „ 1. 8d. „ 1878 ,, 1. 8½. ,, 1879 „ 1. 8d. 1880 ,, 1 9. ,, 1881 ,, 1. 8d. ,, 1882 ,, 1. 7½. ,, School Board Precepts. The Precepts of the School Board still form a very important item in reference to the taxation in the Hamlet. It is true that the Precept for 1882 shews a slight decrease over the total of those of last year, but it still amounts to the enormous sum of £8280 15s., which is equal to a rate of 6½d. in the £. Remonstrances have been, from time to time, addressed to the School Board, against the excessive expenditure, but they have not produced any satisfactory result. For convenience of reference, the Vestry have, at the end of this Report, given a statement showing the amounts paid to the School Board on its Precepts since its formation. Consolidated Rate. The Precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works again shews a considerable increase, being £8858 2s. 3d. this year, as against £8323 2s. 3d. last year. The Vestry have, at the end of this Report, also set forth a statement shewing the amounts paid out of the Rates to the Metropolitan Board of Works on their Precepts since the formation of that Board. The Vestry invite a careful perusal of the statement, as, when compared with the aforegoing statements as to the Vestry's own expenditure, it clearly accounts for a greater part of the increased taxation of late years. Equalization of Rates. The experiment of making the Vestry's calls half-yearly, as mentioned in the last report, was found to be of considerable service for the purpose intended, and the Vestry have therefore determined to continue the practice. 15 The Annual Accounts have been duly audited, and allowed by the Auditors, and are printed and published with this Report. Annual Accounts, In the Speech from the Throne, on the occasion of the Opening of Parliament for the Session of 1882, it was announced that measures for altering the mode of Government of the Metropolis would be introduced. During the recess, numerous meetings on the subject had been held in various parts of the Metropolis, and charges oi misappropriation of funds, reckless extravagance on things alleged to be useless, whilst necessary things remained untouched, and many others of a similar kind were disseminated. The Vestry knew as regards its own acts and believe as regards those of other Boards, that these charges were untrue, but at the same time felt that in the event of a parliamentary enquiry a mere statement to that effect would not do, but that the charges must be shewn to be false by unimpeachable evidence. The Vestry accordingly passed the following resolution:— "That it be an instruction to the officers of the Vestry "to compile a statement of the work accomplished by the "Vestry since the passing of Sir Benjamin Hall's Act." The Act referred to is that under which the Vestry was incorporated. The work of compiling such a history will no doubt be great and will take a considerable time to prepare, but the Vestry feel assured that when it is complete it will shew conclusively that the Vestry has not only not been guilty of the charges made against it but that it has properly executed the duties entrusted to it and fully met the needs of the district under its jurisdiction.

Gentlemen, It is again my privilege to lay before you a brief statement of the works executed under the direction of my department during the year ending March 25th last. CARRIAGEWAY PAVING. The works done under this head were not of very great extent. Stepney High Street was paved with new 4-in. by 7-in. Kincardineshire stone, and the roadway under the Grove Road railway arch was paved to suit the widening of the bridge ; this latter work was carried out at the joint cost of your Board and the Vestry of Bethnal Green. The cost of works executed under this head during the year was £1,221 5s. 8d. FOOTWAY PAVING. Acting upon the recommendation I made in my last Report, you have executed some important work of this description, parts of Stepney Green and Commercial Road have been re-paved and the old stone used in Lichfield Road, Longfellow Road, and other streets not previously paved. The total quantity of new 3-in. York stone laid was 18,477 feet, and of old stone re-laid 13,216 feet. The total cost of the work, including re-laying and re dressing curb, amounted to ^971 9s. gd. CHANNEL PAVING. Your finances have not permitted you to do much work under this head, but 3,600 Tees scoriae blocks have been laid in channels by your own men, the original cost being £39 os. 7d. I would again urge upon you the necessity of proceeding with this work as early as possible, as streets in which the channels are paved can be kept much cleaner than those not similarly treated. REMOVAL OF DUST, The cost of removing dust continues to increase, the quantity collected this year being far in excess of the year ending March, 1881. There is no credit whatever in respect of the sale of dust during the year, and I anticipated this in my last Report. The coming year will probably be but little better. 56 SCAVENGING ROADS. A reference to the Tabular Statement which I append, will shew a total saving upon the expenditure under this head during the previous year, this is owing to the unusually dry winter. The cost of keeping the Yestry's horses was 6s. 5¾d. per day, as compared with 6s. 6d. for the year ending March, 1881. The Vestry's horses worked 9,041 days for one horse, and cost ^2,934 12s. 6d., of this sum ^383 2s. yd. was for depreciation and interest, and ^2,551 9s. nd. for keep of horses and establishment charges. I regret to have to report the loss during the year of 4 of the Vestry's horses, these cost originally ^"270. UNPAVED CARRIAGEWAYS.

HY EMBLEM, GEO. WEDLAKE, J. MILLER, Auditors. B. DUCKHAM, JAMES J. MUSTO, VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. ANNUAL REPORT upon the PUBLIC HEALTH and SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, For the year 1881-82, by M. CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: penny & hull, printers, leman street, whitechapel, e. 1882. REPORT. Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to submit the Twenty-sixth Annual Report upon the Public Health and Sanitary Condition of Mile End Old Town, for the year 1881-2, and ending March last. I have referred to much of the work for the past year in my review of the proceedings in my department during a period of Twenty-six years, and now ready to be presented to the Vestry, in compliance with their order—repetition is therefore unnecessary. Autumn of last year happily witnessed the termination of small-pox as an epidemic, and only a lew sporadic cases have since occurred. I congratulate you upon this result after such a prolonged and anxious contest with that virulent disease, the more so because I am certain that the measures adopted by you contributed very materially to its extinction. There were no deaths in Mile End during the last quarter of the official year ending March last from small-pox. BIRTHS. The total number of births during the year was 4141, compared with 4117 the previous year, and showing a rate of 37.64 per 1000 population compared with 34.7 for the whole metropolis. DEATHS. The total number for the year was 2371, showing an annual rate per 1000 population of 21.55, compared with 2276 deaths in the previous year and a rate of 20.69;the rate for the whole metropolis was 22.2. (See Table I.) which also shows the number of deaths for each quarter, the last being highest. The difference between the number of births and deaths (1770,) represents the natural increase in the population of the Hamlet during the year. Table II shows the number of deaths from all causes under 36 different heads during each quarter. Table III shows number of deaths from eight principal infectious diseases. The annual rate in Mile End Old Town was 3.15 per 1000, compared with 3.34 the previous year, and 3.64 in the metropolis and other large towns combined. In all cases coming to my knowledge printed notices for disinfection and sanitary instructions are at once sent to the houses, by this means I know much good has been done, people become interested in sanitary matters, and it frequently occurs that upon the Vestry's disinfecting man going to do the work it has already been efficiently done. Whooping Cough, as is generally the case, was the most fatal in this class, and yet it appears to receive the least consideration either 011 the part of health authorities or the public generally, the same extent of mortality from any other infectious disease would create an alarm, and the most stringent preventive measures would be adopted, but the suppression of whooping-cough appears to have been given up, either as a hopeless task, or is looked upon as not sufficiently dignified and 4 important to merit official attention. The disease is not only very fatal, but probably more than any other disease, it is liable, when the patient survives, to leave behind its insiduous poisonous effects upon the internal organs, mischief which is frequently fatally developed in after lite, causing serious illness and often death, the real origin of which is unsuspected. The prevention of the spread of whooping-cough would doubtless entail greater difficulties and more stringent sanitary discipline than appears to be necessary with other infectious diseases, but this is only apparent. The disease is more gradual in its development—its dangerous symptoms and effects encroach slowly, and by insidious degrees implicate various vital organs, resulting too frequently in either permanent mischief, too lightly thought of, or fatal results. The disease is as amenable to preventive control as any other of the same class, which experience has proved we are capable of subjugating and suppressing. Measles comes next in degree of fatality, and is also a disease which frequently leaves lasting effects in those who survive, and which parents and friends are too liable to treat with indifference. Table IV shows the number of deaths at different ages, and is interesting. As usual the number of deaths during the first year of age is the highest, being more than one-fourth the total, and if we take the first quinquennial period the number of deaths is close upon half the total, so that half the children born, die during these earliest years; the causes are many and very wide in their nature; it appears to be evidence in favour of the doctrine of selection and survival of the fittest, although this view does not apparently always obtain confirmation, by a study of the qualities of the matured survivors. Table V shows the number of births and deaths in the different wards separately, and in Workhouses within the Hamlet during each of the four quarters. It should be observed that our death rate is materially increased by invalids being sent to the Infirmaries who do not belong to the Hamlet. Table VI shows the mortality in each of the five wards, exclusive of Workhouses, by which it will be seen that the death rate of the normal population was only 20.02, which would be still less were it calculated upon my estimate of the population 110,000, instead of that of the last census 105,573.

The constant system of supply is now almost entirely completed in this Hamlet. This is a most valuable aid to sanitary and social improvement. The water of the East London Company has compared very favourably with that of other river waters, and has been generally superior to them in quality. It has been satisfactorily proved by special investigations, that the rates of mortality in populations supplied by deep well water and by river water are almost identical, and when a difference does occur it is in favour of the river waters—the statistics apply to epidemics as well as to general mortality. I regret to find that the plan of cutting off the water supply to inhabited houses is still extensively adopted by the water companies in cases where the non-resident landlord is nearly always the defaulter; or, in some instances, the outgoing tenant—thus the wrong persons, the immediate tenants are punished, and the public health seriously endangered thereby. No doubt the Act of Parliament empowers the 6 Companies to adopt this unjust and perilous course, but the same Act gives them also the power to proceed summarily before a Magistrate to recover their rates, and so avoid the seriously responsible risk to health and life by depriving large numbers of persons of one of the first essentials of life for weeks and months together. The East London Company has of late years done much to improve their water supply both in quantity, quality and system, hence it is the more regretful that they should exercise this despotic power to the danger of the whole community. ARTIZANS AND LABOURERS' DWELLINGS' ACT, 1868. I have reported upon and recommended the adoption of this Act in respect of 38 houses during the year. The dwellings were situate in Upper York Place, Harford Street, and Pedley's Orchard. This Act has been put into operation many times in the Hamlet since 1868, and upon the whole the results have been very satisfactory— the necessary repairs and alterations based upon my reports being carried out under the advice and supervision of your Surveyor. METEOROLOGY. Atmospheric changes have been unusually numerous, especially from about December, 1881, to May, 1882, and the effect upon the public health has been proportionately exceptional, assuming conditions almost characteristic of an epidemic, the symptoms observed in patients being relatively the same in all cases, affecting brain, nerve, muscle; producing despondency, neuralgic and deep-seated continuous aching pains, especially in all the regions at the back of the body from the head downwards. These symptoms were invariable in innumerable concurrent cases, and could be only attributable to either some septic cause (blood poisoning), or as is far more probable to an exceptional, abnormal disturbance in the constitution of the atmosphere, acting through the medium of the nervous system. I am convinced that Meteorological conditions have recently exercised an unusual and potent influence upon the general public health; and, although in a diminished degree, this influence still prevails and is especially marked in its effects upon persons suffering from other illness. Although it is my duty to make reference to all matters affecting the public health, it is sufficiently obvious that I cannot recommend to the sanitary authority any practicable measures by which they can abate or suppress this source of danger, beyond advising those who suffer therefrom to avail themselves of the advice of their medical advisers. NEW DWELLINGS. The District Surveyor, Mr. C. Legg, has kindly informed me that notice was given for the erection of 36 new houses during the year. As nearly all the open spaces in the Hamlet have now been built upon there only remain the back gardens of the older houses to be covered. Upon these limited spaces the so called Public Health and 7 Building Acts permit new dwellings to be crowded with very small reservations in respect to the certain and deliberately legalized injury to the public health. Appended is the Report of the Sanitary Inspector, showing the numerous works executed in his department during the year. SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT OF WORKS EXECUTED DURING THE YEAR 1881—1882. Houses and premises connected with sewers 72 Old drains abolished 46 Closets cleansed and repaired 22 Houses cleansed, &c. 185 Houses disinfected in consequence of infectious diseases having occurred therein 263 Number of articles of bedding and clothing disinfected 1973 Drains cleansed and repaired 217 Water supply provided 63 Accumulation of offensive matter removed from different premises 28 Premises from which pigs were removed 8 Defective paving repaired in yards of houses 32 New closets provided 5 Overcrowding abated 20 Many inspections of premises where offensive works are carried on, have been made during the year, and the necessary orders given for the abatement of nuisances. In all cases coming to my knowledge, I have removed and properly disinfected (with the consent of the owners) all bedding and clothing used by persons suffering from infectious diseases. The slaughter and cow houses in the Hamlet have also been frequently visited during the year. Your obedient Servant, HENRY LESHAW, Sanitary Inspector. I have to thank the Sanitary Committee and the Vestry for the assistance and encouragement they have given me in carrying out the necessary measures which have been so successful in promoting the public health of the District. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, M. CORNER, M.D , Vestry Hall, August, 1882. Medical Officer of Health. TABLE I.
