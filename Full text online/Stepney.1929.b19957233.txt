REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF STEPNEY FOR THE YEAR 1929. Public Health Department, 43, White Horse Street, July, 1930. To His Worship the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report upon the health and sanitary conditions of the Borough of Stepney for the year 1929. This report will be an account of the work done in 1929 by the late Dr. D. L. Thomas, Medical Officer of Health of Stepney, for an unbroken period of 29 years. Throughout this report I propose to submit special accounts given by him to the Committee last year. Dr. Thomas was an expert in the diagnosis of Small Pox. During the epidemic of 1902, when the type of case was much more severe than now, he had to deal with cases in common lodging-houses and shelters night after night. Dr. Thomas died in the London Hospital on December 10th from Psittacosis. Up to that time very little had been heard of the outbreak of this disease, but shortly after his death there were several other cases brought into the London Hospital. Psittacosis, or parrot disease, resembles typhoid fever in its signs and symptoms. There is the same febrile state, the continual headache and general toxaemia. The disease is conveyed to human beings by infected birds, either by kissing or handling the birds. Cases have occurred where the patient has not actually handled the bird. This may be explained by the fact that the droppings from the birds are also very infectious. These become dry and are disseminated as dust. 4 The infected bird usually looks sick and drooping. There is a nasal catarrh and the shoulder feathers are dull and roughened. The Ministry of Health has publised a practical leaflet on this disease, as follows:— Precautionary Measures. Nothing in the recent occurrences gives any ground for apprehending danger from domestic parrots or other cage birds of the parrot family which have been kept in a household for many months or years apart from any introduction of new birds. On the other hand, this cannot be said as confidently in regard to most newly-purchascd birds. In view of the publicity which the occurrence of psittacosis has received lately in the Press, the public is likely for the present to be chary in buying birds which have recently arrived in this country, or whose history is unknown to the purchaser. Until further investigations have cleared the situation, this caution is not unreasonable. Persons owning these pets would in any case be wise:— (a) to pay attention to strict cleanliness of the cage and protection of food and water from fouling by the birds; (b) to remove immediately any birds that fall sick from contact with healthy birds, afterwards carefully scrubbing and disinfecting the floor of the cage, the perches, the brushes and other articles used in attending to the birds, so as to avoid infection of the healthy birds; (c) to remember that habits of fondling and petting, sometimes practised with parrots which have lived with them a long time, may be dangerous when applied to newly-acquired birds. The next report, for the year 1930, will be a Survey Report. In this report a general description of the progress and change in the Borough during the preceding five years will be given. In addition, any special schemes of the Borough Council or the Ministry of Health will be set out in detail together with a general resume of the whole of the Public Health work in Stepney. In conclusion, T have to express my indebtedness to all the members of my staff for their loyalty and faithfulness in carrying out their respective duties. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. M. Browne, Medical Officer of Health and Administrative Tuberculosis Officer. Population. The resident population of the Borough of Stepney for 1929 is given as 241,800 by the Registrar General, which is 2,200 less than the previous year. The official estimation of the population each year shows a decrease from the census of 1921 of 7,938. 5 Many families have left the district to live on the L.C.C. Housing Estates at Becontree, and many of the better-off residents have gone to live outside whilst still carrying on business in the Borough. The Birth Rate is lower and the Death Rate is higher than the previous year. It is necessary to make an estimate of the population between each Census. The Registrar General's method assumes that the population increases in geometrical progression. The assumption that the same rate of increase continues as in previous years is obviously open to error. A more frequent census taken would help to correct many miscalculations. In a borough such as Stepney, where there is a relatively large migratory population, the Registrar General's mid-year estimate cannot be reliable. Births. The total number of births during the year was 4,215—2,146 males and 2,069 females—or 362 less than in the previous year. .1,216 of the births belonged to the Limehouse District. 669 of the births belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 1,637 of the births belonged to Mile End Old Town. 693 of the births belonged to Whitechapel district.

Wrong Diagnosis. 258 cases of infectious disease were found not to be suffering from the disease stated on the certificate. 128 of the cases were notified by Private Practitioners, 49 from the London Hospital and 81 from other Public Institutions. This number referred to 116 cases of Scarlet Fever, 110 of Diphtheria, 1 of Typhoid Fever, 2 of Puerperal Pyrexia, 11 of Chicken Pox, 1 of Encephalitis Lethargica and 17 of Small Pox. Bacteriological Examinations. 2,427 bacteriological examinations were made on behalf of the Public Health Department during the year. The specimens and the results were as Follows:— Positive. Negative. Total. Swabs (for Diphtheria bacilli) 163 2,258 2,421 Blood (for Typhoid bacilli) 6 — 6 12 Small Pox. From January to December we had 100 cases of Small Pox in Stepney. 247 belonged to the Limehouse District, with 1 death. 20 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, with no deaths. 20(S belonged to Mile End Old Town, with .1 death. .15 belonged to the Whitechapel District, with no deaths. The first case occurred in a patient who resided in St. Thomas Road. The infection was contracted at the patient's place of employment as other cases had occurred there within a short time. On January 30th a boy at a Hostel was sent away with Small Pox. About 15 lads in the same hostel had a history of having had an attack of influenza followed by a rash. They had all returned to work by January 30th. On being examined four of them were suffering from Small Pox. The inmates of the hostel, about 80 in number, were all vaccinated and no further eases occurred there. Unfortunately, however, the infected lads had been to cincmas in the district and we were able to trace 8 cases due to direct contact with them at these places. From these 8 cases, five further or secondary cases developed. A second centre of infection was that of a large wholcseale provision premises in the Borough. The first case was a boy who contracted the disease in another Borough, where he lived. He was at work on January 18th when the rash appeared. Following this case eleven other cases occurred, two of whom lived in our district. All the persons who contracted the disease were unprotected by vaccination. In the present outbreak of Small Pox all the cases have been mild. The infcctivity has varied considerably. In some instances it has been very high; in others it has been very low. Small Pox has been frequently mistaken for Chicken Pox, but during this outbreak many cases have been diagnosed as Influenza. The late Dr. D. L. Thomas issued a letter to every doctor in the Borough calling his attention to this fact. The symptoms at the onset of the disease resemble those of Influenza. When the Small Pox rash appears the temperature generally becomes normal and the patient feels very much better. The result has been that sometimes the doctor has not been informed of the appearance of a rash and he has given up visiting the patient. On May (5th Chicken Pox became a notifiable disease in this Borough Up to the 31st December we have had 820 notifications of Chicken Pox. 11 eases proved to be Small Pox. 13 The s.s. "Tuscania" arrived in Liverpool from Bombay on April 1st having had a case of Small Pox of a virulent type on board. Quarantine is not in force in England, and except those who were actually ill all the passengers and crew were allowed to land. Their names and addresses were sent to the respective Medical Officers of Health of the districts where they went to. There they and their contacts were kept under observation. Five members of the crew came to Stepney and one developed the disease. Throughout the year Small Pox cases have occurred at the different hospitals in the Borough. They were at once removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board (now L.C.C.) hospitals and all the contacts were vaccinated whenever possible. The infected ward was put into quarantine for three weeks and daily inspections were made of the contacts. By these means the spread of the disease was checked and very few secondary cases developed. For the year 1929 there were approximately 17,429 people vaccinated. We have had only 1 death directly traceable to vaccination. This was the case of a child who had been vaccinated in the Mile End Hospital with the parents' consent. The child developed encephalitis and died. Undoubtedly the encephalitis was a result of the vaccination. The child was vaccinated with Government lymph and two insertions only were made. Public vaccinators are now allowed to make only one insertion if the patient so desires. All cases were removed to hospital. The death-rate for the whole Borough was .008 per 1,000 of the population.

The death-rate for the whole Borough was .004 per 1,000 of the population Measles. The number of deaths from Measles was 33, or 59 less than in the previous year. 11 of the deaths were infants under one year of age. 9 belonged to the Limehouse District. 10 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 12 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 2 belonged to the Whitechapel District. The death-rate for the whole Borough was .004 per .1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole of London was .04 per 1,000. During the year, 1,984 cases of measles were reported to the Public Health Department. Most of these were notified by the London County Council Authorities. Some were found by the health visitors while on the district. The great majority of these children are under five years of age so that if we can visit those notified to us by the schools and those met with by the health visitors in the Borough we should be able to help every case. Practically all these cases have been seen by the health visitors in their homes and the parents were advised to call in a doctor. Where nursing was required the district nurse was sent in. The Borough Council pay 1/3d. per visit to the District Nursing Association for cases of measles. The Metropolitan Asylums Board (now L.C.C.) remove as many children suffering from measles as they have accommodation for. They take them in rotation and if we tell them that any one case is of particular urgency they remove it for us at once. 17 At all the municipal and voluntary centres, lectures and talks are given to the mothers. They are told that measles itself is a serious disease and if neglected the diseases resulting from it may prove fatal. Broncho-pneumonia is one of the commonest complications of measles and is the most usual cause of death. Conjunctivitis or inflammation of the eyes is another of the troublesome effects of measles. If this is not treated at the beginning the child may suffer from a chronic affection of the eyes. The mothers are also instructed how to take the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the disease and also the nursing and care to be carried out during and after the illness. Advice leaflets are issued to the schools where cases of measles occur and the health visitors also leave them at the homes. According to the London County Council Report on Measles, 1927-28, Stepney had 2,212 cases in 29 weeks. The report goes on to say that the close co-operation between schools and public health authorities is the chief important point in reducing mortality from measles. All absences in the infants departments should be investigated immediately and the Borough Medical Officer informed at once if measles is suspected. Whooping Cough. The number of deaths from Whooping Cough was 84, or 59 more than in the previous year. 23 belonged to the Limehouse District. 17 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 43 belonged to Mile End old Town. 1 belonged to the Whitechapel District.

The age periods were as follows:— 1 year and under 2 years 1 2 years ,, ,, 5 ,, 3 5 ,, ,, ,, 15 ,, 12 15 „ „ „ 25 „ 16 25 ,, ,, ,, 45 ,, 34 45 ,, ,, ,, 65 ,, 135 65 and upwards 174 The death-rate for the whole Borough was 1.5 per 1,000 of the population Heart disease is a very common disease in this country. Its frequency ir early life has led to much research work in children of school age. Here th< disease has been shown to be chiefly due to early rheumatic infection. On< attack of rheumatism, unfortunately for those cases who have to live in thi: climate, does not confer immunity. Recurring attacks are very common, s< that if the heart is not affected in the first instance it is bound to be seriousl) damaged by the recurrence of rheumatic infection. Under twelve years of ag< rheumatism nearly always affects the heart. In many cases diseased tonsil; and adenoids are the source of the disease. 19 Other infectious diseases, e.g., Scarlet Fever, may seriously affect the heart, but with suitable care and treatment such a condition is temporary only and the heart recovers completely. Among adults it is customary nowadays to estimate the severity of the heart lesion more by its effect on the patient's mode of life than by the actual extent of the lesion itself. Cancer. 273 deaths were due to Cancer, or 37 less than in the previous year. 62 belonged to the Limehouse District. 46 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 99 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 66 belonged to the Whitechapel District. The death-rate for the whole Borough was 1.12 per 1,000 of the population. There has been a reduction in the number of deaths as compared with the previous year, but for some years the number had been steadily increasing.

The cause of the occurrence of cancer remains obscure. e Various reasons have been given but without sufficient proof. Various articles of diet have been suspect also certain drugs. There is no doubt that the liability to cancer is influenced largely by personal predisposition. But it has not been proved to be a hereditary disease. No danger has been shown to follow from living in a house or district where a large number of cancer cases have occurred. Neither is there any evidence to show that cancer is an infectious or contagious disease. Undoubtedly chronic irritation is a frequent cause of cancer. Thus a badly-fitting denture may set up trouble or where there has been chronic ulceration as in lupus, cancer is a frequent sequel. The same holds true of the lower bowel where cancer frequently appears. Here there is a long history of constipation with its constant irritation of the lining membrane of the bowel. 20 Certain occupations, such as working in tar, may produce cancer in special parts of the body. The obvious remedy is to avoid any sources of irritation to the skin, and for the same reason decayed teeth should be removed, constipation avoided, and the general health and hygiene of the body attended to. Zymotic Diseases. The total deaths from diseases of a Zymotic character was 216, or 6 less than in the previous year. They include all deaths from Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever and Diarrhoea. 63 belonged to the Limehouse District. 59 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 83 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 11 belonged to the Whitechapel District.

Report by the late Medical Officer of Health, Dr. D. L. Thomas:— The fifth Health Week in the Borough was held this year during the period 28th October to 2nd November inclusive. Lectures or film displays were given throughout the week at the Limehouse Town Hall, St. George's Town Hall, Working Lads' Institute, Darby Street Mission, Dame Colet House and in co-operation with the Borough Librarian two lectures were given at the Mile End Library. A Trade Exhibition was held at the Limehouse Town Hall and demonstrations were given daily on cooking, home nursing, infant care, etc. All the Maternity Centres were open to Visitors each afternoon and facilities given for visitors to see the Council's Destruction Works, the Tuberculosis Open-air School and the Light Department of the London Hospital. The last-mentioned was very much appreciated by the 24 visitors, and proved very interesting. The opening ceremony took place on Monday, 28th October at the Lime house Town Hall. Major C. R. Attlee, M.A., M.P., was kind enough to declare the opening of the Exhibition and Health Week, and ne remarked on the wonderful progress made in the health of the people of Stepney. The most striking improvement having been made in the infantile death-rate. This was due, he said, to active work of every kind, particularly to the work of the Council. They also had the housing policy, but perhaps the most important and practical part of their work was that of the Infant Welfare Centres. Stepney was one of the most foremost among London Boroughs, and the public money was well spent in this direction. Public Health is not a matter to be left entirely to the Council; it was for every person to do something towards promoting the Public Health. The opening ceremony was followed by an admirable lecture (about 200 people attended), entitled "Secrets of Good Health," given by Sir Arbuthnot Lane, Bart., C.B., M.S., F.R.C.S. (President of the New Health Society). During his lecture he stated that he advocated pillion-riding, and the press gave this full publicity. On the Wednesday afternoon a Baby Show was held which was a great success. So many entries had been received that the number had to be limited to 150. The babies were examined as regards their weight, teeth and general health, and the judges had a difficult job to decide the winners and many thanks are due to the examiners. I am glad to say that everything went off very well, and there was no grumbling from the unsuccessful mothers. Mrs. L. Frankel presented the prizes which were kindly given free. 30 On the Friday, Councillor D. Frankel, J.P., paid an official visit as Mayor to the Exhibition. The Venereal Disease lectures, accompanied by films, were very well attended throughout the week at the different halls. Lectures on milk and teeth were provided for the school children at the Limehouse Town Hall, and large numbers of children were present. The lectures on health and tuberculosis were much appreciated, so much so that questions were asked by the audiences. A statement of the receipts and expenditure was forwarded to the Borough Treasurer. On the whole, our Health Week was a great success, and I take this opportunity of thanking Dr. Browne and Mr. Lellow for their efforts, as well as the Health Visitors, Clerks and Sanitary Inspectors, and all others for their assistance. Canal Boats Acts, 1877 and 1884. Pursuant to the Third Section of the Canal Boats Acts, 1884, the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, being the Registration Authority under the above Acts, has to report as follows with regard to the Execution of such Acts and of the Regulations made thereunder, and as to the steps taken by them as such authority during the year to give effect to the provisions of the said Acts and Regulations, viz.: — (1) Canal Boats coming within the district are inspected by a Sanitary Inspector, who receives a sum of £10 per annum for the performance of this duty. His inspection is irrespective of the examination of Boats made by the Examining Officer prior to their registration. (2) The number of Boats inspected in 1929 was 40 and the condition of the Boats and their occupants, as regards the matters dealt with in the Acts and Regulations was good. In only one instance was there any infringement of the Acts and Regulations, viz. :— Cabin overcrowded; there being a man, wife and 7 children occupying the after cabin which was registered for two adults and three children. Ten children were found on the boats, five being of school age and five under school age. There is now only one boat on the register. No boats were registered during the year. 36 Unsound Food.

In the case of sample E 31, the vendor did not apply within 60 hours for a sample to be taken on delivery, but after the summons was served, he stated that he held a warranty from a cowkeeper who had one cow only and asked that an "appeal to the cow" sample might be taken. Sample M 37 was therefore taken and was found to be genuine, containg 3.3 per cent. of fat. It was later found that the vendor did not hold a warranty. Two samples E 71 and E 72 were taken from the same shopkeeper, E 71 was adulterated and E 7.2 was genuine. The Inspector was informed that the latter sample was taken from milk reserved for special customers. A sample E 92 taken from the wholesaler at the vendor's request was found to be genuine. In the case of sample A 28, the inspector was informed that the vendor was adding 8 pints of water to every 17 gallons. This would represent 5.0 per cent. of added water, and the percentage found amounted to 6.2 per cent. Sample F 83 was labelled "Sterilized Milk, Kosher." Out of a total of 14 samples of bottled sterilized milk, one was adulterated and 7 were reported as being of poor quality. Samples B 37 and B61 contained practically the same amounts of added water. Legal proceedings were therefore only taken against the wholesaler from whom sample B 61 was taken on delivery to the vendor of B 37. One sample M 17 contained colouring matter (annatto). At one time the use of this substance was very widespread. The addition of any colouring 80 matter in milk is prohibited by Section 4 of the Milk and Dairies Amendment Act, 1922. In connection with sample F 2 containing 3.4 per cent. of added water 15 churns were sampled at Paddington Station. The percentage of fat in these samples ranged from 3.25 to 3.50 and averaged 3.36 per cent., while the solids-not-fat ranged from 8.50 to 8.62 per cent. with an average of 8.53 per cent. This is poor quality milk. If this milk had been of good quality the addition of 3.4 per cent. of added water would not have been detected as the solids-not-fat would not have been reduced to less than the legal minimum. Although 3 to 4 per cent. of water can be added to good quality milks with safety, it is not wise for both wholesaler and retailer to do so, nor is it wise for a retailer to add small quantities of water when the milk is originally of poor quality. On one of the hottest summer days, formalin was detected in two samples, H 38 and H 40. The vendor of H 40 was supplied by the vendor of H 38, the summons against the vendor of H 40 was therefore withdrawn, Hospital Samples.— During the year 10 samples were taken on delivery at St. Peter's Hospital. 3 samples, D 19, D 20 and D 80 were adulterated and 2 samples S 45 and S 46 were of poor quality. The wording of the contract has now been altered so that the milk supplied must conform with the requirements of the Act. Under this new form of contract, proceedings were taken against the contractor supplying the milk from which sample D 80 was taken. It was stated for the defence that the churn had not been opened during transit between the farm and the hospital and that although the milk supplied by the farmers to the contractor was usually tested, such had not been done on this occasion. Butter. Out of 168 samples examined, 6 samples were found to be adulterated. A 29 Unlabelled bulk margarine bought as butter. Vendor fined 10s. with £1 1s. costs. G 12 (Informal). Consisted entirely of margarine. A further formal sample from the same vendor was genuine. G 59 (Informal). Contained 0.01 per cent. boric acid. G 61 (Same vendor as G 59). Contained 0.01 per cent. boric acid. The vendor was fined £2 with £1 1s. costs, and the wholesaler supplying the vendor was fined £10 with £3 3s. costs. C 43 (Informal). Contained 0.02 per cent boric acid. C 53 (Same ven lor as C 43). Contained 0.02 per cent. boric acid. The vendor was fined £20. 81 Ground Ginger. 5 samples were examined, and of these 4 samples were adulterated with sulphur dioxide preservative. K 43 (Informal). Contained 440 parts sulphur dioxide per million- K 50 (Same vendor as K 43). Contained 390 parts sulphur dioxide per million. Vendor cautioned. J 29 (Informal). Contained 2,000 parts sulphur dioxide per million. J 31 (Same vendor as J. 29). Contained 2,000 parts sulphur dioxide per million. Samples J 29 and J 31 were contained in small tins with the words "Kosher" and "Warranted pure" on the label. The Magistrate decided that legal proceedings could not be taken against the manufacturers. No action was taken against the retailer. Margarine. 137 samples examined were genuine, and free from preservative and prohibited colouring matters. Sausage. Out of 12 samples examined six were found to be adulterated. These 6 samples consisted of preserved sausage. K 73 Beef Sausage (Informal). Contained 170 parts sulphur dioxide per million. K 74 Pork Sausage (Informal). Contained 120 parts sulphur dioxide per million. K 75 Pork Sausage (Informal). Contained 420 parts sulphur dioxide per million. K 88 Beef Sausage (Same vendor as K 73). Contained 200 parts sulphur dioxide per millio. The vendor was fined £3 with £1 1s. costs. K 89 Pork Sausage (Same vendor as K 74). Contained 70 parts sulphur dioxide per million. The vendor was fined £3 with £1 1s. costs. K 90 Pork Sausage (Same vendor as K 75). Contained 70 parts sulphur dioxide per million. The vendor paid 10s. 6d. costs. Sausage may contain not more than 450 parts of sulphur dioxide per million if the presence of this preservative be declared. In none of the above 0 cases was the presence of preservative declared either by notice or by label. The remaining samples were free from preservative. 82 Pepper. 12 samples were analysed and of these one sample was found to be adulterated. A 57 (Informal). Contained 40 per cent. of foreign starch (potato). A further formal sample purchased from the same vendor consisted of genuine pepper. Table Jelly. 3 samples examined were genuine. Of these 2 contained sulphur dioxide preservative and one was free from preservative. B 71 (Informal). Contained 90 parts sulphur dioxide per million, and was labelled in an unsatisfactory manner. (See page 84). Vinegar. Out of 12 samples examined, two samples were found to be adulterated. T 52 (Informal). 4.5 per cent. deficient in acetic acid. T 57 (Same vendor as T 52). 5.0 per cent. deficient in acetic acid. The vendor was cautioned. All the samples consisted of artificial vinegar. Cream. 14 samples of cream were genuine and free from preservatives and thickening substances. The fat content varied from 32.5 per cent. in the case of a sample of "Sterilised Cream" to 62.4 per cent. in a sample described as "Rich Double Cream." The average fat content was 50.9 per cent. There is no legal standard for the fat content in cream. Ice Cream. Four samples examined were genuine, Three samples contained in each case 2.6 per cent. of milk fat and were thickened with starch. One sample contained 7.1 per cent. of fat and was free from starch filling. There is no legal standard controlling the composition of ice cream. It is, however, generally agreed that a fat standard of about 7 per cent. would be a reasonable one. Honey. Six samples examined were genuine and free from glucose, starch and artificial invert sugar. Jam. Of 9 samples of jam, four samples contained 15, 32, 6 and 13 parts of sulphur dioxide per million respectively. All the samples were genuine. 83 Coffee. 15 samples examined were genuine. One sample H 66 (Informal) which contained chicory to the extent of 56 per cent., was labelled "Coffee and Chicory Mixture." Fruit Wines. Three samples of fruit wine were analysed and all were found to be genuine. Two samples contained sulphur dioxide preservative in amount not exceeding the limit allowed. One sample was an alcoholic wine, the remaining two samples were labelled "Non-alcoholic." T 85 (Informal). Raisin. Contained 90 parts sulphur dioxide per million and 11.1 per cent. of alcohol by volume. T 86 (Informal). Black Currant Flavour. Preservative absent. Contained 0.5 per cent. of alcohol by volume. This sample consisted of sugar and water containing artificial flavouring and dye. T 87 (Informal). Orange. Contained 220 parts sulphur dioxide per million and 0.7 per cent. of alcohol by volume. All the samples were free from prohibited dyes. Liquor is not regarded as intoxicating if the content of proof spirit does not exceed 2 per cent. (equivalent to 1.15 per cent. of alcohol by volume). [Section 11 of the Licensing and Accommodation Act, 1910]. Drugs. Of 139 drugs examined 8 or 5.8 per cent. were adulterated. N 13 Glycerine (Informal). Contained 20 parts lead per million. N 31 Glycerine (Same vendor as N 13). Contained 35 parts lead per million. The vendor paid £7 7s. costs. J 25 Boracic Powder (Informal). Contained 60 parts lead per million and 8 parts arsenic per million J 32 Boracic Powder (Same vendor as J 25). Contained 65 parts lead per million and 8 parts arsenic per million. The vendor was cautioned. A 89 Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine (Informal). 12.9 per cent, deficient in ammonia. A 90 Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine (Informal). 12.9 per cent. deficient in ammonia. A 91 Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine (Same vendor as A 89. 12.9 per cent. deficient in ammonia. The vendor was cautioned. A 92 Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine (Same vendor as A 90. 12.9 per cent. deficient in ammonia. The vendor was cautioned. 84 Poor Quality Samples. Under this heading are grouped samples of low grade or of doubtful character. 63 or 6.8 per cent. of the total milk samples were found to be slightly below the legal standard of composition. This shows a decided increase on previous figures, viz.:—49 or 4.7 per cent. in 1928 and 27 or 3.2 per cent. in 1927. Other poor quality samples were•—1 butter, 1 boracic powder, 1 Glauber's salt, 1 cream of tartar, 1 sal volatile (slightly deficient in alcohol), 1 jam (contained 10 per cent. of glucose), 2 flour (contained persulphates), and 1 cheese (Fat 20.0 per cent., moisture 51.9 per cent., and made from milk containing 2.7 per cent. of fat). Offences other than Adulteration. Margarine.—In 6 cases the vendor had not complied with the requirements of the Act with regard to labelling. In 3 of these cases the sample had been purchased informally, in 2 cases the vendor was cautioned and in one case legal proceedings were taken. N 60 Unstamped wrapper. Vendor paid £2 2s. costs. Milk.—In 3 cases for offences in connection with the bottling of milk otherwise than on registered premises, fines totalling £6 10s. were imposed, and costs amounting to £2 12s. were paid. In 1 case in which the vendor was not registered as a purveyor of milk no action was taken. Table Jelly.—One sample B 71 (Informal), containing 90 parts of sulphur dioxide per million was labelled in a misleading and unsatisfactory manner. An article of food may contain preservative if the constituents from which it is made are allowed to contain preservative. These constituents must not, however, in the final product, contain more than the maximum amount of preservative allowed in each constituent by the Regulations. The article commonly sold as Table Jelly consists of gelatine and sugar (both of which may contain preservative) with flavouring and colouring matters. The allowed preservative found from an analysis of sample B71 totalled 150 parts sulphur dioxide per million, so that the sample which contained 90 parts sulphur dioxide per million satisfied the requirements of the (Preservatives, etc., in Food) Regulations with regard to the content of preservative. 85 The carton containing the sample was, however, labelled:—"Special Notice. No antiseptics or preservatives are used in the manufacture of this Pure Fruit Table Jelly." It will be noted that the makers do not say that the sample is free from preservative, but merely that no preservative has been added. The intention of the label is to convey the impression that the jelly does not contain any preservative. On the instructions of the Public Health Committee it was pointed out to the retailers that the jelly contained preservative and their attention was drawn to their label. The retailers replied that the jelly was not made by them but the manufacturers had assured them that the jellies contained no preservative as stated on the packet. In addition the actual manufacturers wrote to say that, "We guarantee that no preservatives or antiseptics are used in the manufacture of this jelly, and also all raw materials we use are guaranteed to conform in every respect with the requirements of the Food and Drugs Acts and all regulations relating to Food Stuffs now in force." This is merely a more detailed version of the label and again does not admit the presence of preservative. The Medical Officer of Health informed the retailers that the jelly contained preservative within the permitted amount, but that the notice created an impression that the jelly did not contain preservative, and that the notice should be withdrawn or altered in such a way as not to create a wrong impression. The retailers finally stated that the notice on the carton would be deleted in future. Miscellaneous Samples. Public Health Department.—53 samples examined for the Public Health Department were made up as under:— 14 samples of various imported tinned foods were examined for the presence of preservative. All the samples were free from preservative. The samples consisted of:—Ham, Carrots, Peas (Copper absent), Pineapple, Strawberries (2 samples), Sugar Peas (Copper absent), Apricots, Cherries, Plums, Crosby Corn, Raspberries, Sausages and Pears (The latter sample was in an unsatisfactory condition and contained a trace—002 grain per lb.—of tin). 5 samples of finned Black Currants were unsatisfactory, cither with regard to the condition of the contents or the condition of the tin or both. The samples contained 0.9, 22, 2.2, 23 and 2.8 grains of tin per pound respectively. 86 7 samples of imported dried fruits were free from preservative. These samples consisted of:—Sultanas 2, Raisins 1, Currants 1, Prunes 1 and Muscatels 2. 11 samples of imported dried fruits contained preservative. These samples consisted of:—Apricots 2, Peaches 1, Pears 1, containing 1,090, 1,105, 1,970 and 1,120 parts sulphur dioxide per million respectively. (Apricots, Peaches and Pears are allowed to contain not more than 2,000 parts sulphur dioxide per million) and Raisins 7 samples containing 50, 360, 745, 245, 240, 510 and 610 parts sulphur dioxide per million respectively. (Raisins and sultanas may contain not more than 750 parts sulphur dioxide per million). 7 samples consisted of:—Formalin, Condensed Milk, Water, Disinfecting Fluid, Caramels, Ointment and Butter. These samples do not require any comment. Other samples analysed were:— Two samples of Lemonade and 1 sample of Sugar said to have produced ill-effects were free from harmful ingredients or impurities. One sample of Pills suspected of containing lead compounds contained harmless ingredients, but the pills were covered with a talc coating weighing 45 per cent. of the weight of the pill. One sample of Chocolates were found to be unfit for human consumption. The vendor was fined £10 with £2 2s. costs. Two samples of Sugar were contaminated with urine. One sample of Butter contained 60 per cent. of margarine. In one case where it was suspected that wine was being made from grapes, a sample of the product was obtained. The liquid consisted of Wine Vinegar containing 6.1 per cent. of acetic acid. Borough Engineer.—II samples of Carbolic Powder were examined, of these 10 complied with the requirements of the specification and one was unsatisfactory. The specification states that "carbolic powder must contain not less than 15 per cent. of tar acids calculated as cresylic acid, the base to consist of siliceous or other inert matter." During the period that these examinations have been made, the following unsatisfactory powders have been condemned: (1) Chalk containing 4 per cent. of tar acids, (2) Flue dust mixed with wood tar creosote containing 9 per cent. of acidic oils of doubtful disinfectant value, and (3) Spent gas lime containing 9 per cent. of naphthalene. 87 Borough Electrical Engineer.—5 samples analysed comprised:—Water 3, Condenser Tube Deposit 1, and Valve Deposit 1. Private Samples.—2 samples of Butter and 1 sample of Honey were submitted for analysis by private purchasers. I wish to express my appreciation of the able assistance given me in the laboratory by Mr. W. M. Paulley, B.A., F.I.C. I have the honour to be.
