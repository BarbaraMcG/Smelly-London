Medical Officer of Health METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year i960 by T. Standring, M.D.,B.S.,D.P.H.,M„R.C,,S.,L.R.CoP.,F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health PREFACE To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. MR. MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting my Report for the year 1960 on the Public Health of the Borough of Woolwich. At the outset I am pleased to state that the general health of the Borough is very satisfactory. The Registrar General's estimate of the home population for 1960 was 145,470 being an increase of 670 on the previous year. The birth rate of 14.9 was the highest for the Borough since 1951* and the death rate of 9-8 the lowest for the Borough since 1954, and the second lowest figure on record. Deaths from cancer, totalling 292, were again high. There were 37 infant deaths, compared with 41 in the previous year, 25 of them occurring in children under one week old. The year was a very satisfactory one so far as infectious disease in the Borough was concerned. The general incidence was the lowest for any year on record, and no special difficulties were experienced. However, effective control over such diseases as diphtheria and poliomyelitis requires continued effort to ensure that the vaccination rate is kept at a satisfactory level. Recent sporadic outbreaks of diphtheria in London and elsewhere in the country have shown that vigilance in this respect cannot be relaxed. The great strides made by the Council in housing and slum clearance since the War were materially advanced during the year. Confirmation was received from the 2 Government of the Ann Street Nos, 5-8 Areas, and rehousing of the occupants in these Areas was commenced., Altogether 1,156 new dwellings were completed in the Borough during the year, besides the erection by the Borough Council of the first of the four 14-storey blocks of flats in the St„ Mary's Comprehensive Development Area - the highest block so far erected by the Council, Dwellings were completed on a number of other sites in the Borough, including the Bostall Estate and at Southend Crescent, The scheme for the erection of 71 dwellings in the Belson Road and Kingsman Street Area was also begun. The County Council's work on the Abbey Estate was also materially advanced during the year. Further large areas of the Borough were brought under Smoke Control during 1960 and the results achieved to date prove the worth of the work of the Council in this sphere‚ By the end of the year six large areas in the Borough were under Smoke Control, covering over 9*000 houses, A further 5*000 houses will be brought under Smoke Control by October, l§6l. Two further large areas, covering 4,500 houses are also being surveyed for this purpose, so that by October, 1962 20,000 houses will be under Smoke Control out of a total of 44,000 houses in the Borough, In recent months there has been a greater awareness among the public generally of the harmful effects to health of noise, and an Increasing number of complaints of excessive noise have been received by the Council, Recent complaints have related to noise from factories and from building sites, noise from the delivery of milk bottles, noise from ice-cream chimes, noise from electric motors in flats, and most frequently of all, noise from motor traffic. The Council's Public Health Inspectors are able to deal with most of these complaints and with the co-operation of the offenders bring about a reduction in the amount of noise. The serious consequences, particularly to the very young and the very old, from home accidents is repeatedly emphasised in the Council's Health Education activities. Every effort is being made to draw attention to the simple precautions and safeguards that should be taken to prevent these home accidents. The Council, besides co-operating with the County Council in special Home Safety campaigns, undertakes local publicity on home accident prevention, which includes the showing of sound films, the giving of talks, advice from the staff when visiting individual homes, and the distribution of a large amount of literature and other information on the subject. 3 During the year much discussion took place on the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. The Borough Council's evidence to the Commission had strongly stressed that local services should be locally administered. The Commission in its Report fully recognised the essential local nature of these services and went considerably further than the proposals which had previously been agreed between the County Council and the Metropolitan Boroughs for the re-transfer of the personal health services to Metropolitan Boroughs. The Commission recommended that, in addition to the whole of the personal health services, the welfare services, i.e. both domiciliary and residential for old people, for children, for the disabled, and for the homeless, should be transferred to revised and generally enlarged Greater London Boroughs. The Woolwich boundaries, however, would remain unchanged. The Commission considered that the personal health, welfare and children's services should be in the hands of the same authority, and the authority should be that also responsible for the housing and environmental health services. There has been much support for the Commission's views on the future administration of the health services in London, and so far as these services are concerned the Borough Council in submitting its views on the Royal Commission's proposals to the Minister welcomed the Commission's proposals to transfer these services to the Boroughs. Lastly, may I take this opportunity of thanking the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee, and other Members of the Council, for their support during the year, and also thank the staff of the Health Department for the interest shown and the good work done by them during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. STANDRING. 4 HEALTH COMMITTEE at 3lst December, 1960 THE WORSHIPFUL THE MAYOR (Councillor Mrs.J.E. Carroll,J.P.) Councillor Mrs.E.M.

After correction for inward and outward transfers, the net number of Woolwich live births was 2,179 being 207 more than in the previous year. Of the total births 1,109 were boys and 1,070 girls. It is known that 1,518 births took place in public institutions in the Borough, of which 856 concerned Woolwich mothers. The birth rate was 14.9 which, when adjusted to allow for the differing age and sex distribution of the population in various parts of the country, gives a birth rate of 14.8 compared with the birth rate for London of 17.8 and that for England and Wales of 17.1. There were 39 stillbirths during the year under review. MARRIAGES There were l,04l marriages in the Borough during 1960, 8 of which 678 took place in Churches; the remaining 363 took place at the Woolwich Register Office. Of the number of marriages which took place in Churches in the Borough, Registrars of Marriage attended on 134 occasions. DEATHS The number of deaths registered in Woolwich was 1,153 and after correction for inward and outward transfers the net number was 1,424 giving a death rate of 9.8 for the Borough, compared with 10.6 the previous year. Of the total deaths, 609 (or 42 per cent.) were over 75 years of age. The adjusted death rate for Woolwich was 10.4 compared with the figure of 11.4 for London and of 11.5 for England and Wales. Deaths of Woolwich residents in hospitals in the Borough totalled 409,whilst 480 died in other hospitals. MATERNAL DEATHS There were no maternal deaths during 1960, nor in the previous year.

Of the accidents involving pedestrians, two of the fatalities concerned pensioners, one a middle-aged man, and the remaining two a youth and a toddler. Accidents involving motor cycles continue to take a toll of young lives. Of the five which occurred, four were men under 25 and one a middle-aged man. Pedal cyclists suffered three fatalities, two being in collision with cars, and one died after falling from his cycle. 10 One young woman was killed when her Invalid chair swerved in front of a car. OTHER FATAL ACCIDENTS Other fatal accidents, totalling 11, showed an even greater drop than road accidents, being exactly half the 1959 total. As usual falls accounted for the greatest number, totalling five deaths all of persons over sixty. They included a fall downstairs and one out of bed. The accidental inhalation of domestic gas caused one death, and the exhaust fumes from the engine of a motor launch another. Burns caused the deaths of two pensioners. The remaining two deaths were caused by falling objects at work, in one case of a lathe, and in the other collapsing steelwork. DEATHS FROM CANCER Of the total number of deaths,292 were from Cancer (excluding Sarcoma), being 13 more than in the previous year. Of these, 148 occurred in men and 144 in women.

Samples of water are submitted by the Board to their own laboratory for chemical and bacteriological examination. No complaints were received by the Health Department during the year as to either the quality or quantity of the water. 17 There are still seven wells in use in the Borough, and samples of well water taken for bacteriological examination revealed the water to be satisfactory. Well water is used for industrial purposes, firefighting, and at the Council's swimming baths at Plumstead and Woolwich. DRAINAGE The Public Health Inspectors supervised the necessarywork of repair or reconstruction of the 190 drainage defects which were discovered during the year. 36 smoke tests were applied on suspected defective private and combined drains. Of the tests made, 18 showed that the drains were defective, of which three were in respect of drains which were not in use. These drains were subsequently exposed by the staff of the Department and permanently sealed off. Thirty-four combined drains were inspected and tested during the year and in one instance - a broken inspection chamber cover - it was necessary to serve a notice on the responsible owner under the provisions of Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, to remedy the defect. SHOPS ACT, 1950 The provisions of the Shops Act, 1950 relating to the suitability of ventilation, sanitary accommodation, the maintenance of suitable temperature, lighting,washing facilities, and facilities for taking meals by employees in shops, is the responsibility of the Borough Council. For this purpose, 8^1 visits of inspection were made by the Public Health Inspectors during the year. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 The registration and supervision of sellers of Part II poisons (other than registered Pharmacists) is carried out by the Council under the above-mentioned Act. The number of persons entered on the Council's list at the end of the year was 149. 18 CINEMAS The sanitary conveniences in cinemas in the Borough were inspected at regular intervals throughout the year to ascertain that a satisfactory standard of cleanliness was maintained. The standard generally was found to be very good. PET SHOPS The ten pet shops in the Borough are licensed annually by the Council and visited periodically by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the requirements of the Pet Animals Act, 1951, and the conditions subject to which licences are issued, are being complied with. Ninety inspections of pet shops were made during the year. RAG FLOCK There are three premises in the Borough registered under the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, and one factory licensed under the Act for the manufacture of rag flock. During the year seven samples of filling materials were obtained for analysis. Three samples of cotton felt, and single samples of rag flock, woollen mixture felt, curled hair and fibre mixture were obtained. All the samples passed the prescribed standards of cleanliness. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS PREMISES All persons carrying on the business of a hairdresser or barber must be registered in accordance with Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954 and also have their premises registered with the Borough Council. In addition, the Council have made Byelaws to secure the cleanliness of these shops and of the instruments and equipment used therein. Applications for registration were received during the year in respect of 46 Ladies' hairdressers premises, 48 Gentlemen's, and 10 combined ladies' and Gentlemen's premises. Regular inspections are made by the Public Health Inspectors. 19 FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 - 1959 TABLE NO. 11 DETAILS OF INSPECTIONS CARRIED OUT DURING I960 PREMISES No. on Register Inspections Written Notices Occupiers prosecuted (l) Factories in which Sections 1,2,3* 4 and 6 of the Act of 1937 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 17 27 - - (ii) Factories not included in (i) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority 275 161 6 - (iii) Other premises in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority (excluding outworkers1 premises) - - - - TOTAL 292 188 6 - CASES IN WHICH DEFECTS WERE FOUND AND REMEDIED DEFECTS No. of cases in which Prosecutions instituted. defects were found Found Remedied Referred to H.M.

Local industry also employs 9^ outworkers who reside outside the Borough. 21 Periodical inspections of the outworkers' homes are made by the Council's Public Health Inspectors. Altogether 252 such visits were made in 1960 to ensure that the home working conditions were satisfactory. RODENT CONTROL During the year 726 complaints of rats and 365 of mice were received, and in addition to the investigation of these complaints systematic inspection under the "block control" system was continued. A total of 21,590 premises were inspected and of these 18,412 were under "block control". Forty-three "block control" schemes were carried out during the year. The number of properties found to be infested by rats or mice was 1,813, which included 177 business or industrial premises. Where the cause of the infestation appears to be due to defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is requested to effect the necessary repairs. In this connection the Department carried out 33 smoke tests on suspected defective drains at rat infested premises, and these tests produced evidence of 15 defective drains. As in previous years, the Council continued its practice of arranging free treatment in respect of infestations in private dwellings. A charge is made for treatment carried out by the Council at business or industrial premises. With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer's Department, two sewer treatments and test baiting were undertaken during i960. The extended period of baiting was continued, pre-baiting being carried out on the first and fourth day and poison baiting on the eighth day. The bait used was sausage rusk with zinc phosphide as the poison and paranitrophenol as a preservative. Repeated baiting took place where there had been complete "takes". WOODWORM AND OTHER PESTS Throughout the year various complaints were received from residents in the Borough of infestations of woodworm, cockroaches, silver fish, moths, carpet beetles, and wasps. 22 All the complaints received were Investigated and where required, the Department carried out the necessary disinfestation. In all, 44 premises were disinfested of woodworm, 5 of cockroaches, 2 of moths, 1 of carpet beetles, and 66 of wasps. Of the houses treated to rid them of woodworm 38 were Council-owned houses. Charges made to the responsible persons for the work outlined above totalled £167. Wasps - The new method of disinfestation for wasps proved very successful and reduced the cost from an average of 27/6d. to 5/-d. per nest. The method is simple and easy, and consists of applying a powder containing 0.5$ Dieldrin. Two ounces of this powder, which must be placed at the entrance to the nest, is sufficient to ensure that the incoming wasps carry enough powder into the nest to kill all the wasps. All external wasp activity ceases in about 3 hours. Fine weather is necessary for the successful disinfestation of nests where the entrances are exposed to the elements. Some 66 nests were dealt with, and 100 per cent, success with single treatments was obtained. MASON BEES INFESTATION Two infestations by Mason bees affecting 20 houses were dealt with. Brickwork in both infestations was "honeycombed" to a large extent. Power spraying with a Vermicin/D„D.T. preparation effected instant and complete disinfestation. PROVISION OF DUSTBINS The number of dustbins provided by owners after the service of Intimation or Statutory Notices was 45. In 27 cases it was necessary to serve Statutory Notices on the owners concerned; no legal proceedingsvrere necessary for this purpose. 23 EXCHANGE OF GIFTS FOR OLD CLOTHES Legal proceedings were instituted by the Council in respect of an offence reported by the Police in an Eltham Street where the Defendant had distributed notebooks, ball pens, and trinkets to children under 15 years of age in exchange for old clothing, contrary to Section 26 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1952. The Police Sergeant who reported the infringement had previously warned the Defendant, who had nevertheless persisted in the practice. He was fined £5. BURIALS AND CREMATIONS During the year arrangements were made by the Department for the burial or cremation of six persons who had died in the Borough, where it appeared that no other suitable arrangements were being made for their burial. Five of these persons were elderly. The Council's expenses in this work during the year amounted to £95. 6. 10., of which £90. 5. 0. was recovered from the Estates of the deceased persons. ELTHAM CREMATORIUM The modern Crematorium in the grounds adjoining the Eltham Cemetery is administered by the Woolwich, Greenwich and North-West Kent Joint Crematorium Committee. This Joint Committee comprises the Boroughs of Woolwich, Greenwich, Bexley, Dartford, Erith, and Gravesend, and the Urban Districts of Chislehurst and Sidcup, and Crayford. The Crematorium was opened in 1956 and during the past three years an average of over 2,300 cremations has taken place there annually. This is the highest number of admissions in Crematoria in the South or South-East London areas. STREET CLEANSING There are over 157 miles of roads to be cleansed in the Borough, of which 15 per cent. are swept at least once daily, 20 per cent. three to six times weekly, 55 per cent. twice weekly, and 10 per cent. once weekly. 24 Eighty-eight street sweepers are employed on the work, and, in addition, a mechanical sweeper and sprinkler is used to sweep the main traffic routes in the Borough and the roads In the shopping areas of Powis Street, Plumstead High Street, and Eltham High Street. Approximately 9,550 street gulleys are cleansed periodically by mechanical gulley cleansing machines. HOUSE AND TRADE REFUSE During the year under review, 43,550 tons of refuse were collected by the Council's vehicles and 44,420 tons disposed of at the Council's Refuse Destructor. The difference between the two weights is largely the quantity of refuse delivered to the Refuse Destructor from the Royal Arsenal and from the Army Barracks. Some 1,838 tons of scrap metal, 1,674 tons of waste paper and 134 tons of textiles were salvaged and 2,154 yards of clinker sold during the year, producing an income of £12,860. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES There are nineteen conveniences for men, and a similar number for women, within the Borough. In all conveniences the water closets are available without charge. FREE WASHING FACILITIES - PUBLIC CONVENIENCES For the past nine years, the Council has provided free washing facilities at the main public conveniences, including the provision of paper towels, and this service continues to be used to an increasing extent and is much appreciated by the public. The paid washing facilities, which include the supply of a linen towel, are also available. The above information on Street Cleansing, House and Trade Refuse, and Public Conveniences, has been kindly supplied by the Borough Engineer. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES The Council has four bathing establishments in the Borough. This service includes Swimming Baths, Slipper Baths, Turkish Baths, Public laundry, and the use of the 25 Eltham Baths Public Hall in winter for social and sporting activities. The attendance figures for the Public Laundry during the past five years are as follows: 1959/60 - 23,570; 1958/59 - 26,081; 1957/58 - 23,939; 1956/57 - 18,295; and 1955/56 - 12,924„ Attendances for Slipper Baths in 1959/60 totalled 113,665, and the total attendances for all services for the year was 748,960, an increase of 50,370 over the year 1958/59. Altogether 195,675 schoolchildren attended at the Baths in organised classes for swimming and swimming instruction, and 5,083 swimming lessons were provided for members of the public. Considerable progress was made with the Modernisation Scheme at Woolwich Baths, which it is hoped will be completed in mid-1962. The detailed attendances for the year ended 31st March, i960 were as follows:- Public Swimming 350,917 Swimming Tuition 5,083 School Swimming 195,675 Slipper Baths 113,665 Turkish Baths 10,459 Public Laundry - Hand Washing 9,243 Machine Washing 14,327 Swimming Clubs 40,254 Schoolchildren - Cricket School 2,063 Free Baths to Old Age Pensioners and Unemployed Persons 7,274 748,960 In all three swimming baths the water is continuously filtrated and chlorinated. Routine sampling of water from the Council's swimming baths and boating and paddling pools Is carried out. 26- 32 samples were submitted to the Southern Group Laboratory at Hither Green Hospital for bacteriological examination and were also tested for chlorine content and pH reaction by the Health Department. The average results of the examinations and tests are as follows:- Probable No. of Bacillus Coll per 100 m.l. Average PH Value Average free Chlorine p.p.m Average Temperature. Plate Count. Yeastrel agar 2 days at 37°C. aerobically per m.l. Swimming Baths 0 7.7 1.82 75.5 2 (average) Paddling and Boating Pools 0 8.0 0.12 - 12 3 22 600 X 4 2 200 x 5 x non pathogenic due to soil contamination. The routine physical cleansing and chlorination of paddling and boating pools is producing improved bacteriological results. OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE The Borough Council has again played a prominent part in the welfare of the elderly in the Borough. A record is kept of all elderly persons requiring periodic visits by the Health Department. This register contains over 900 names. 27 Every effort is made to visit at intervals of not more than three months, and more frequently - weekly and sometimes even daily - when necessary. Many first requests were again received for assistance to elderly persons and all were dealt with promptly. Altogether over 4,000 visits were made by the Council's Woman Inspector and her Assistant during the year to the homes of the aged. There is close co-operation in this work between the Council's Inspector and the General Practitioners, District Nurses, the Hospital Service, and the County Council's Home Help and Welfare services, and with the Mobile Meals organisers and the workers of the Council of Social Service. Wherever possible, every endeavour is made to provide an elderly person with nursing or domestic help in his or her own home to enable them to continue living at home for as long as possible. Assistance with admissions to hospital is given. During 1960 it was not found necessary to apply to the Courts for the compulsory removal to hospital of any person resident in the Borough. Laundering for the Incontinent Aged Under powers contained in the Public Health (London) Act, the Council provides a service for the washing of soiled linen belonging to the incontinent aged where other arrangements are not reasonably possible,, The disinfecting staff of the Health Department carry out this work and there has recently been a greatly increased demand for this service. New equipment installed has enabled the volume of work to be doubled. There is a collection three times weekly and the number of persons using this service at any one time averages twenty. The total number of articles dealt with during the year was l6,86l comprising the followlng:- Night attire 1,114; Sheets 4,657; Draw Sheets 3,187; Blankets 225; Pillow cases 1,247; Towels 2,051; Miscellaneous 4,380. 28 Bathing and Cleansing Arrangements are made for the regular attendance at the Council's Bathing Centre of a number of aged persons, who are conveyed to the Centre and then returned home after bathing. A number of these persons are provided with clean clothes and their own clothes are laundered and returned to them. The Council's scheme for home bathing of the aged by the staff of the Health Department was continued under powers contained in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953. A total of 96 aged persons was cleansed in their own homes during the year. The Borough Council arranges for pensioners to have hot baths at a reduced charge, and over 6,000 aged persons attended at the Council's baths during the year. Lunch Clubs The two luncheon clubs organised by the Woolwich Council of Social Service continue to be well used. These clubs are held at a room at the Plumstead Baths and at the Progress Hall, Eltham. Domiciliary Chiropody A domiciliary chiropody service for aged persons is organised by the Council of Social Service, this scheme augmenting the County Council's chiropody service at Clinics in the area. Arrangements are proposed for an increased number of sessions by the visiting Chiropodist. Holiday Scheme Under the holiday scheme operated by the Council of Social Service a total of 125 persons spent a week's holiday at Westgate during the year. Two parties went in May and two in September. The organiser reports that the two Guest Houses used are both kept by former Woolwich residents. 29 Each party was accompanied on the coach Journey by a voluntary worker, who was able to arrange small outings and generally contribute to the holiday makers' wellbeing. Most of those enjoying a holiday under the scheme contribute a proportion of the cost, the balance being met by a grant from the Borough Council. In addition to the holiday parties at Westgate, help was also given towards the cost of a holiday for 16 other aged persons who were too frail or handicapped to stay in an ordinary Guest House. For them accommodation was found in Homes where some nursing care was available. In some cases holidays were arranged to coincide with those of the relatives with whom they lived, thus giving the relatives a break from their responsibilities. A number of appreciative letters have been received by the Council of Social Service from those who enjoyed a holiday during the year. The voluntary work carried out by a number of local organisations in the Borough for the elderly is recognised by the Borough Council, who make a substantial grant for this purpose. NUISANCE FROM NOISE The passing of the Noise Abatement Act has been welcomed as giving additional power to deal with noise nuisance. In London the Act amends Section 66 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937 and now provides that noise nuisance, including vibration, shall be deemed to exist where any person makes, or continues or causes to be made or continued, any noise which Is a nuisance. A local authority may serve an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance and the notice may be enforced by complaint to a Magistrate's Court. In addition, three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise nuisance may complain to the Magistrate's Court. The defence available to the occupier of a trade or business that he has used the best 30 practicable means of preventing or mitigating the nuisance, having regard to the cost and other relevant circumstances, is retained. During the year the Council also considered the effect of the existing legislation available to prevent or mitigate noise in all its aspects. The Council decided that the provisions of the Byelaws in force in the Borough should be given more publicity in order that the public may be made aware of the remedies available to them to deal with contraventions of such Byelaws. Complaints were received during the year of excessive noise from motor vehicles, and in particular motor cycles. Assurances were received from the local police authorities that action against an offender is taken when circumstances warrant intervention by the Police. The Noise Abatement Act imposes a total prohibition on the use of a loudspeaker in a street between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., and prohibition on the use of loudspeakers in the street at any time of the day or night for advertising any entertainment, trade, or business. However, the use of ice-cream chimes between noon and 7 p.m. is permitted if they are operated so as not to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. Proceedings for an offence may be instituted by a local authority or by a member of the public. During the year the Council adopted a Byelaw dealing with noisy instruments in streets in the following form"No person, for the purpose of hawking, selling, distributing, or advertising any article, shall shout or use any bell, gong or noisy instrument in any street or public place so as to cause annoyance to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood." HOUSING REPAIRS At the end of the year it was estimated that there were 44,090 dwellings in the Borough. Premises inspected for housing defects under both the Public Health (London) Act and the Housing Act totalled 1,943. Of the total number inspected, 882 houses were found to be not in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. 31 A total of 662 houses were rendered fit by informal action, which included the service of 607 Intimation Notices. In 276 instances it was necessary to serve Statutory Notices to ensure that the necessary work of repair was carried out. House-to-house inspections under the provisions of the Housing (Consolidated) Regulations, 1925 were made in 126 houses. OVERCROWDING On routine inspections or following complaints from householders, or at the request of the Housing Department, 36 families were visited. Eleven were found to be statutorily overcrowded and reports were made to the appropriate authority. It is the duty of the Council to supply in writing a statement of the permitted number of persons in respect of any dwelling, and in this connection 57 premises were visited and measured following requests for the information from either tenant or landlord. SLUM CLEARANCE AREAS The Council's agreed Slum Clearance programme for the five-year period 1956-196O had been virtually completed at the end of 1960. In the revised 1956-1960 Clearance programme for the Borough 922 properties were scheduled for clearance, 510 to be dealt with by the Borough Council and 412 by the County Council. The following Borough Council Clearance Areas were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government during the year:- Date confirmed by Minister Castile Road Area - Nos: 1-5 Castile 29th November,1960 Road. 32 Ann Street No. 5 Area-Nos: 63a Vicarage Road, 86-106(even), 110-126(even), 126a, 128-134 even) Villas Road. 20th July,1960 Ann Street No. 6 Area-Nos: 37-45(odd), 47-57(odd) Vicarage Road, 36-46(even), 52, 58, 62-66(even), 70&72, 27-37(odd), 45-75(odd) Villas Road; 46-86(even), 86a, 88-102(even), 45-99(odd) Ann Street; 29-37(odd) Walmer Terrace; 38-64(even) Robert Street. 8th July,1960 Ann Street No. 7 Area-5&7 Glyndon Road 10th May, 1960 Ann Street No. 8 Area-21-25(cons.)

Kirkham Street Area Nos: 26-64(even), 68, 23-27(odd), 31-69(odd) Kirkham Street; l8-58(even), 9-29(odd) Ravine Grove. FUTURE SLUM CLEARANCE AREAS Agreement was reached with the County Council during 1960 on the allocation of future Slum Clearance Areas between the two Authorities for the period 1961-1965. The two Authorities agreed to the submission to the Minister of a list comprising 727 properties, the division of responsibility between the respective Authorities to be 33 allocated as follows:- 496 properties to be cleared by the Borough Council. 231 properties to be cleared by the County Council. As in previous programmes, the proposed Areas may be subject to some variation when the detailed inspection of the properties is undertaken. INDIVIDUAL UNFIT HOUSES The following unfit houses or parts of houses were represented by me during the year as unfit for human habitation and not capable of being made fit at reasonable expense. Demolition Order 99 Rectory Place. Closing Orders 116 Red Lion Lane. 5 Salutation Alley. Closing Orders:Part of Premises 19 Woolwich Common-Basement front and back roos. 106 Woodhill-Basement left (living) room, and basement right (scullery) room. 5 Graydon Street-Basement back (scullery) room. 19 Fennell Street-Basement living room. During the year the Council determined Closing Orders or Undertakings not to use the house for human habitation, in respect of 3 Saunders Road, 31 Waverley Road, 19 Abbey Terrace, and 9 Passey Place (Basement rooms). CERTIFICATES OF UNFITNESS Under the Housing Subsidies Act, 1956 where a local authority proposes to demolish dwellings which have been purchased by them for clearance purposes, to establish the unfitness of these dwellings the Minister of Housing and Local Government requires a Certificate from the Medical Officer of Health as to the unfitness of the dwellings, and also requires a local authority to pass a Resolution that the houses be demolished as unfit. 34 Certificates of Unfitness were issued by me during the year in respect of the undermentioned properties:- 2-24(even), 28, 30, 24, 38-42(even) John Wilson Street; 15 Parsons Hill; 3 Belson Road; 7 and 8 Marshall's Grove; and 180 Woolwich Church Street. RENT ACT, 1957 - CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR The following are the details of applications received during the year for various certificates under the Rent Acts - No. of applications for Certificates of Disrepair 32 No. of applications for Certificates of Disrepair refused. 1 No. of notices to landlords of the Council's intention to issue a Certificate of Disrepair 33 No. of undertakings received from landlords, and accepted by the Council 22 No. of Certificates of Disrepair issued 11 No. of Certificates issued to landlords as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 18 No. of Certificates issued to tenants as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 5 Twenty-nine applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair were received from landlords or their agents on the grounds that the defects specified on the Certificates had been satisfactorily remedied. In 23 instances it was found that the required repairs had been completed and the Certificates were cancelled. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS More owner-occupiers of premises in the Borough are taking advantage of the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959 which enables a local authority to pay monetary grants to owners and in certain cases leaseholders, who desire to 35 modernise their properties. Applications for both discretionary and standard improvement grants increased in number. To qualify for a discretionary grant, the dwelling must after improvement, comply with the following twelve point standard - (1) be in a good state of repair and substantially free from damp; (2) have each room properly lighted and ventilated; (3) have an adequate supply of wholesome water laid on in the dwelling; (4) be provided with efficient and adequate means of supplying hot water for domestic purposes; (5) have an internal or otherwise readily accessible water closet; (6) have a fixed bath (or shower) in a separate room; (7) be provided with a sink or sinks and with suitable arrangements for the disposal of waste water; (8) have a proper drainage system; (9) be provided in each room with adequate points for gas or electric lighting (where reasonably available); (10) be provided with adequate facilities for heating; (11) have adequate facilities for storing, preparing and cooking food; and (12) have proper facilities for storing fuel (where required). The Local Authority may,at their discretion, pay a grant up to half the estimated cost of improvement, subject to a minimum grant of £50 and a maximum grant of £400. Work of repair and maintenance necessary to conform to the standard does not, however, rank for grant unless it is work needed as a direct consequence of improvement work, as for example, the re-decoration of a room where the 56 decorations have been damaged in course of the structural improvements. The standard grant scheme is simpler than the discretionary grant scheme. It is not necessary for an applicant to submit detailed plans and priced specifications, and a grant is payable by the local authority to owners for installing one or more of the following five standard amenities, which are not already existing - (1) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; (2) a wash-hand basin; (3) a hot water supply to the sink, bath and basin; (4) a water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling; (5) satisfactory facilities for storing food. The dwelling must have all five standard amenities when the improvement work has been completed and must be fit to live in , and likely to remain so, for 15 years. The grant payable is half the cost, up to a maximum of £155 for installing all five standard amenities. This sum is reduced by £25 if there is already a bath or shower; by £5 for a wash-hand basin; by £40 for a water closet; by £75 for a hot water supply; and by £10 for a food larder. All applications for improvement grants are submitted to the Borough Treasurer and referred to the Health Department for an inspection to be made to determine whether the proposed work will satisfy the provisions of the required standard. During the year 169 applications for discretionary Improvement grants, and 85 applications for standard improvement grants, were received and reported upon. An additional 196 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectdr to advise owners and builders concerning proposed improvement grant schemes. 37 HOUSING PROGRESS The number of dwellings built in the Borough of Woolwich during the year was as under:- By Borough Council 284 „ London County Council 609 „ Private Enterprise 263 1,156 In addition, at the end of the year the Borough Council had a further 735 dwellings under construction. Building continued in the St. Mary's Comprehensive Redevelopment Area, in particular in the Samuel Street/ Prances Street area, where by the end of the year the first of the four 14-storey blocks of flats was nearing completion. The flats in these tower blocks are to be heated by electric underfloor heating with supplementary heating by means of an electric panel fire. Laundry facilities will be provided. A further scheme comprising 71 dwellings was commenced in the Belson Road/Kingsman Street area. In the Glyndon Area further rehousings from substandard properties have been carried out, and plans prepared for the erection of 252 dwellings. During the year, 70 families were rehoused from Temporary Dwellings, and in due course there will be permanent housing development on the sites. Dwellings have also been completed and occupied on several sites in the Borough, in particular on the Bostall Estate, where 131 families were housed, and at Southend Crescent where a further 72 housings took place, thus completing the first part of the scheme. The first 24 dwellings were occupied at Strongbow Road, and work had commenced on the 9-storey block of flats. This block is also to be heated by electric underfloor heating. Improvement work to 25 properties in North Woolwich was completed. This work included the provision of bathrooms and the modernisation of the kitchens. 38 The initial steps in respect of the Clearance Area procedure were taken with regard to certain of the dwellings in Kirkham Street and Ravine Grove, and in addition the Borough Engineer was asked by the Housing Committee to consider and prepare a Master Plan and layout for the redevelopment of the Clothworkers Area at Woolwich Common. In accordance with the requirements of the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act, 1955 all requisitioned properties were released by the 51st March, 1960. At the 31st December, 1960 there were 9,471 tenancies in properties owned or controlled by the Council, and at that date there were 2,546 applicants on the Housing Register, compared with 2,785 the previous year. I am indebted to the Council's Chief Housing Officer for this information on the Housing progress in the Borough. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD PREMISES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED OR OFFERED FOR SALE A total of 1,886 inspections of food premises other than the dally market inspections was carried out by the Food Inspectors during the year. Inspections of registered food premises during the year were as follows:- Dairies 12: Distributors of Milk 176; Ice-cream Premises 289; Premises where Meat Is Potted, Pickled, Pressed and Preserved l8l; Premises where Sausages are manufactured 52; Premises where Fish is cured or prepared for Frying 44; Wholesale dealer in Margarine 2; Restaurants, Cafes and Snack Bars 328; Industrial and School Meals Service Canteens 133; Markets-Daily; Bakehouses 4; Itinerant Vendors 9; Non-registered Premises 147; Greengrocery and Fish Shops 151; Public Houses 232. 39 FOOD SAMPLING, 1960 During the year ended 31st December, 1960, 716 samples of food and drugs (being 506 informal and 210 formal samples) were submitted for analysis to the Public Analyst. Of these 16 informal samples and three formal samples were reported to be adulterated or otherwise not complying with the statutory requirements, giving a percentage of 2.6 compared with 4.3 in 1959. No private samples were examined during the year. Adverse reports were received on the following samples:- TABLE NO. 12 Sample No. Article Formal or Informal (For I) Adulteration or Irregularity 167 Bread I Contained small pieces of wood baked in the loaf. 168 Macaroon I Rancid and unfit for consumption. 139 Smoked Haddock (Prepacked) I Incorrectly labelled. 156 Minced Beef F Contained sulphur dioxide (50 parts per million) contrary to the Preservatives in Food Regulations. 165) 166) Milk I Contained a small piece of steel wool and two small particles of rust. 43 Dried Oxtail Soup Contained potato starch not disclosed on the label. 190 Hamburgers I Incorrectly labelled. 295 Tea I Incorrectly labelled. 40 521 Sponge Mixture I Contaminated by insects (small beetles) 415 Milk Chocolate containing Whisky I Label misleading; stated to contain Whisky but amount of Whisky insignificant . 416 Creme Coffee & Brandy Chocolate I Label misleading, contained no Brandy. 417 Creme Mocha Rum Chocolate I Label misleading, contained no Rum. 412 Pure French Lard I Did not consist entirely of pure Lardo 515 Marzipan I At least 13 per cent, deficient in ground almonds. 373 Bronchial Mixture I Deficient in Chloroform. 646 Cochineal I Contained Glycerine, not disclosed on label. 709 Rolls and Butter F Contained Margarine; no butter found. 746 Rolls and Butter F Contained 6 per cent. Butter and 6 per cent. Margarine. From the bare statement of facts set out above it may not be apparent that your Public Analyst, Dr. Amphlett Williams, Ph.D., is one of the foremost practitioners in this field. On many occasions he has been instrumental in bringing important food questions into the open. Only last year he was the leading figure in presenting the report of the Association of Public Analysts on the use of misleading labels, and advertisements of certain medicinal preparations, following which an agreed Code of Practice for the labelling of Proprietary Medicines has now been introduced. 41 legal proceedings were instituted by the Council for the offence of selling Whisky containing excessive water. The first Defendant was fined £10 with three guineas costs, and the second Defendant was fined £2. A warning letter was sent to the vendor of Formal sample 156 (Minced Beef) which contained preservative contrary to the Preservatives in Pood Regulations. SALE OF ROLLS AND BUTTER During the year a number of samples of rolls and butter were obtained for analysis, and it was found that in some cases the rolls had been spread with a mixture of margarine and butter, or spread with margarine only. Whilst noting that customers obtained a reduction in price by reason of the use of margarine instead of butter, the Council decided to circularise all proprietors of cafes, restaurants, and licensed premises in the Borough drawing their attention to the practice obtaining in certain of these establishments and stating that, whilst the Council was not concerned with the fact that margarine is from time to time used in substitution for butter, this being purely a matter for the proprietor to determine, it was an offence to serve margarine when the customer had asked for butter where the circumstances were such that the customer might reasonably expect to be supplied with pure butter. The letter suggested that where margarine was used the customer's attention should be drawn to this fact, either by notice or by other means. COMPLAINTS OF UNSOUND FOOD The Council instituted legal proceedings in respect of a complaint of mouldy Bridge Pies. The former employee of the firm supplying these pies was fined £3 with £6.6.0. costs, the summons against the firm being dismissed. A warning letter was sent to the persons responsible for the sale of a Yankee Doughnut Ring containing a matchstick. The Council expressed its concern at the practice of the use of matches for lighting the gas rings of the cooker on which the doughnuts were prepared. The firm 42 subsequently installed an electric cooker and the use of matches was discontinued. A warning letter was also sent to the bakers of a bread roll which was found to contain part of a cigarette. A complaint was received from a Woolwich resident of a dirty milk bottle delivered to her home, the milk having been bottled in the area of another local authority. The complaint was referred to that authority to consider the institution of legal proceedings. The bottle contained particles of foreign matter, probably small mould growths, which were in contact with the milk. Legal proceedings were subsequently instituted by the authority concerned against this firm. Other complaints of unsound food dealt with by the Pood Inspectors during the year related to mould in Bread (5 cases); mould in sausages (3 cases); mould in meat pie (2 cases); maggot in flour and in sultanas; dirt in a milk bottle (2 cases; in one of these the Public Analyst reporting that the foreign body consisted of fragments of wire); bread containing webbing; canned meat containing string; and jam alleged to be unfit for human consumption. It was found that the Jam had been over-cooked during the manufacturing process. A number of complaints of stale foodstuffs was also investigated. Inspection of the food premises was carried out and in some instances the remaining stocks were withdrawn from sale. Other complaints of alleged unsound food were taken up with the vendors concerned and the complainants invariably expressed themselves satisfied with the action taken. POOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS The Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960 which amend and consolidate the existing Pood Hygiene Regulations, take account of the experience gained since 1955. The definition of 'food handlerp' ha3 been extended to persons who wash up or clean food equipment, and the prohibition of smoking whilst handling open food now also includes the taking of snuff. 43 HYGIENE IN HOSPITAL CATERING DEPARTMENTS At the request of the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee, inspections of the Catering Departments at the five Hospitals in the Borough were carried out, and detailed reports submitted. MILK SUPPLY At the close of the year, one Dairy and 118 registered Distributors of Milk were operating from within the Borough. The Council also approved registration of a further 27 Distributors who distribute milk in the Borough from premises outside. Under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, 217 dealers' licences and 73 supplementary licences were issued authorising the use of the special designations "Sterilised", "Pasteurised", and "Tuberculin Tested". The percentage of fat content of milk samples submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis was as follows:- Fat Content 4.5 per cent. and over Nil 4.0 per cent. and under 4.5 per cent. 8 3.5 per cent. and under 4.0 per cent. 96 3.0 per cent. and under 3.5 per cent. 70 Below 3 per cent. Nil Total 174 During the year 235 samples of Pasteurised or Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, to assess the keeping quality of the milk by the Methylene Blue test. All the samples were reported as satisfactory. 44 Of the 239 samples which were subjected to the Phosphatase test at the Park Hospital Laboratory, 230 passed the test and nine failed. All the samples which failed the Phosphatase test were from the same Dairy. In all these cases of failure corresponding samples had been tested in the Dairy's own laboratory and reported as satisfactory. The recording graphs used in the tests were checked, as was the pasteurising temperature. No fault was detected in the equipment. Further samples were immediately taken and all passed the test. Twenty-three samples of Sterilised or Tuberculin Tested Sterilised milk were submitted to the Park Hospital for the Turbidity test, and satisfactory results were reported on all the samples taken. The practice of taking samples of milk in the course of the early morning delivery to schools, hospitals, and institutions in the Borough was continued during the year. Nineteen samples were submitted for chemical analysis, 21 for the Phosphatase test, and 21 for the Methylene Blue test. Satisfactory reports were received on all the samples. Inspections of the premises of Milk Distributors were carried out regularly. In two cases it was necessary to serve notices to remedy defects found. The various tests referred to above are now contained in the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 which consolidate and re-enact with amendments previous Milk (Special Designation) Regulations. The principal changes made by the new Regulations are that dealers' licences, except for a few kinds which will be granted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, will be granted by the Food and Drugs authority for the area within which are situated the premises at or from which the milk is to be pasteurised, sterilised or sold, and licences so granted will permit sales outside as well as inside the area of the licensing authority. Thus, supplementary licences are discontinued. A dealer's pre-packed milk licence is introduced to permit the sale of all three kinds of special designated 45 milk where the milk is obtained by the dealer in the container in which it is to be supplied to the consumer. The duration of all licences granted is extended from one year to five years. ICE-CREAM There were 332 registered ice-cream premises in the Borough at the end of the year, of which four were used for the manufacture of ice-cream and four for the storage of ice-cream. The majority of the dealers sell only prepacked ice-cream. Routine inspections of all registered shops are made, and during the year seven defects were found and subsequently remedied. The premises of each new applicant for registration are inspected to ensure that they are satisfactory, and the applicant is advised of the requirements relating to ice-cream contained in the Heat Treatment Regulations. During the year 14 samples of ice-cream were submitted to the Laboratory for grading by the Methylene Blue test, and all proved satisfactory. PUBLIC HOUSES There are 131 licensed premises in the Borough, 28 of which serve main meals. The supervision of the hygienic conditions in public houses is carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. During the year, 132 inspections were made and as a result four informal notices were issued to secure the remedying of the defects found. MEAT INSPECTION The total number of animals slaughtered and inspected at the Garland Road Abattoir during the year was 57,282 which included 14 goats. Details are as follows 46 TABLE NO.13 CARCASES & OFFAL INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED IN WHOLE OR IN PART, 1960 Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Goats Number killed and inspected 9,300 – 6,955 12,694 28,319 14 All diseases (except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci) Whole carcases condemned – – 17 11 22 – Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 3,918 – 45 435 5,382 – Percentage of the number Inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci 42.2 – .89 3.5 19.0 – – Tuberculosis only Whole carcases condemned 3 – – – 1 – Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 137 – – – 464 – Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis 1.5 – – – 1.7 – Cysticercosis Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned and treated by refrigeration. 91 – – – – – 47 The decline in the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle, (1.5% compared with 5.2% in 1959) significantly coincides with the completion of the Ministry's tuberculosis eradication scheme. Of nearly 7,000 calves inspected, no tuberculosis was found. Indeed there has been no case of tuberculosis in calves at this slaughterhouse since 1958. The parasites infesting cattle are principally liver flukes and the percentage of bovine livers so infested has shown no serious decline over the past four or five years. More than 3,000 livers were condemned because of liver fluke. Very few hydatid cysts were observed, but 91 carcases were found with localised cysticercosis, which after refrigeration treatment were released for distribution. During the course of routine inspection of pigs, two cases of Swine Fever were diagnosed and subsequently confirmed by the Ministry's Veterinary Officer. This is the first time in the 23 years operation of this slaughterhouse that Swine Fever has been confirmed. Swine Erysipelas is still very prevalent among pigs, and appears very difficult to eradicate. At least 10 per cent. of all pigs inspected were found to have pneumonia in varying degrees or the lungs damaged as a result of pneumonia. LICENSING OF SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND SLAUGHTERMEN Licences to slaughter animals (sheep, pigs, calves, and cattle only) were issued by the Council to ten slaughtermen at the Garland Road Abattoir. This Abattoir was also licensed by the Borough Council. During the year the Ministry made The Authorised Officers (Meat Inspection) Regulations, which prescribe a new qualification, the holder of which will be eligible to be appointed by a local authority as an Authorised Officer under the Food and Drugs Act to act in relation to the examination and seizure of meat. The primary reason for creating the new class of Officer Is to help overcome the difficulty which has been experienced by some local authorities in recruiting men for work in large pig slaughterhouses, such as bacon factories. To date the Council have experienced no such shortage of qualified Food Inspectors for work at the local Abattoir. 48 CLEAN AIR SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Considerable progress was made during the year towards bringing the whole of the Borough under Smoke Control. At the end of 1960 there were seven Smoke Control Areas in operation and a further six Areas were in various stages towards completion. The following Areas, details of which were reported in my Annual Report for 1959, are now in operation St. Mary's Abbey Wood (Abbey Estate) Abbey Wood Middle Park (North East) Middle Park (South West) Abbey Wood No. 2 Clothworkers Wood Details of the six Areas being brought into operation are as follows Abbey Wood No.3 Area The Area comprises 380 acres, and includes 1,973 dwellings, of which 1,793 are private. It is estimated that some 1,700 dwellings will require conversion of approximately 2,900 solid fuel appliances, and a further 550 existing approved appliances will require adaptation. The Smoke Control Order was made by the Council in June and confirmed by the Minister in October, 1960. The operative date of the Order is 1st October,1961. Coldharbour Area This Area, which includes the Council's Coldharbour Estate and properties in Sidcup Road, comprises 350 acres, and includes 2,806 dwellings, of which 1,715 are permanent Borough Council post-war properties, and 1,091 private dwellings. Approximately 2,500 of these dwellings require some 3,000 new solid fuel appliances, and a further 600 existing approved appliances will require adaptation. The Smoke Control Order was made by the Council in June and confirmed by the Minister in October, 1960. The -49- operative date of the Order is 1st October,1961. St. Mary's No. 2 Area This Area comprises 26 acres and includes 596 dwellings, of which 25 are private, 415 Borough Council, and 56 London County Council. The London County Council and Woolwich Borough Council dwellings are already fully equipped to burn smokeless fuel. The private properties require 62 new solid fuel appliances, complete with gas ignition. The Smoke Control Order was made by the Council in October, 1960 and awaited confirmation at the end of the year. The Order comes into operation on 1st October, 1961. Several unfit properties on an island site in this Area have been exempted from the Order, as they are not scheduled for demolition until after the operative date. St. Mary's No. 3 Area This Area comprises 12 acres, and consists of a London County Council Redevelopment area. The number of properties to be erected by the County Council is not yet known. No conversions are required. The Smoke Control Order was made by the Council in October, 1960 and awaited confirmation at the end of the year. The Order comes into operation on 1st October, 1961. New Eltham Area This Area comprises 380 acres, and includes 1,916 dwellings, of which 24 are Council properties, and 1,892 private properties. Approximately 1,400 dwellings will require some 2,300 appliances, and a further 1,000 appliances will require adaptation. It is anticipated that the Order will come into operation on 1st October, 1962. Horn Park Area This Area comprises 454 acres, and includes 2,359 dwellings, of which 1,045 are Council properties, and 1,314 private properties. Approximately 1,500 dwellings will require some 2,150 appliances, and a further 315 -50- appliances will require adaptation. It is anticipated that the Order will come into operation on 1st December, 1962. General At the end of the year there were 986 acres and 9,223 dwellings within operative Smoke Control Areas, and a further 1,602 acres and 9,650 dwellings within Areas being brought into operation. Details of the size, and number of properties in the aforementioned Areas, together with the proposed new Areas, are set out in Table No.14 and the accompanying map. Although the Council stresses at every opportunity the advantages to be gained from the installation of approved continuous burning open fires complete with permanent gas ignition, many owner/occupiers have not carried out conversions and, therefore, propose to rely upon the use of the proprietary smokeless fuels in their existing appliances. In such cases a simple declaration is signed by the owner/occupiers stating that they are aware of the difficulties which they may encounter in the future. The original estimates of cost for each Area are based upon a 100% conversion rate. However, it has been found that the final costs, particularly in the case of owner/occupied property, have been much reduced. During the year, after enquiry of other London Boroughs, the Council accepted the Ministry's suggestion of a £5. limit for grant aid on a continuous burning appliance. When the Council's Smoke Control activities first commenced, the majority of conversions were undertaken by one large contractor. Whilst the contractor made strenuous efforts to complete the work before the operative date of the Order, considerable delays occurred. During the year several more contractors began to undertake the work and the delay has considerably lessened. -51- TABLE NO. 14 - SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Map Ref.

To cover cases of financial hardship, the Council decided to pay the whole cost of reasonable works in the case of owner/occupiers who were Retirement Pensioners and who were also receiving National Assistance. Later, as in some instances Retirement Pensioners who were eligible for National Assistance were not applying for it, the Council extended its decision to include such persons. A total of 13 payments were made. CHURCHES The Council has discretion to pay such grant as it thinks fit in respect of conversions in Churches, Church Halls, etc. Following a recommendation of the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, the Council agreed to contribute 30 per cent. of the reasonable cost and to give consideration to any representations Church Authorities may wish to make for greater payment. During the year one payment of 30 per cent. was made. PROCEDURE The Memorandum on Smoke Control Areas, issued by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, required that the Council, after agreeing in principle to the setting up of a Smoke Control Area should submit details to the Minister for preliminary approval. Representations have been made by various bodies to the Ministry that this preliminary approval was unnecessary in "black" areas after the approval of a local authority's first Smoke Control Order. An alternative suggestion was for the Minister to agree to a 'block' approval for the whole of a local authority area. A simpler procedure is to be adopted for the future. LIGHTING SOLID SMOKELESS FUEL The Council has given every encouragement to the installation of gas ignition as the easiest means of -54- lighting solid smokeless fuel. However, in some cases, the cost of the installation of a gas supply is prohibitive, and the Minister of Housing and Local Government has been unwilling to confirm the cost for grant aid. During the year a Ministry circular suggested that the use of wood and paper for igniting the smokeless fuels should be permitted, and to this end it suggested that Smoke Control Orders should contain a general exemption relating to the emission of smoke by the use of this method of ignition. It is recognised that generally gas provides the most convenient method of lighting solid smokeless fuels. However, during the year an electric fire-lighter was produced by a well-known Company. This fire-lighter will light coke as easily as gas and at a comparable cost. At the end of the year the Ministry was considering the possibility of allowing this appliance, although portable, to rank for grant. FUEL SUPPLIES The local supply of proprietary or "premium" smokeless fuels continues to improve. There are now several brands from which a choice can be made, and no complaints have been received from residents in Smoke Control Areas of inability to obtain authorised fuel. Nevertheless, the Council continues to advise residents not to place reliance upon any one of these fuels by insisting upon the delivery of only one brand. The supply of coke continues to be plentiful throughout the area. Only one instance was reported of the delivery of house coal in a Smoke Control Area, and following discussion with the retailer concerned authorised fuel was substituted. Careful watch is maintained by the Council's Smoke Inspectors for the emission of smoke in the operative Smoke Control Areas, and I am pleased to report that no serious infringements have been observed. PUBLICITY The Council continues to ensure that their Smoke Control activities are given adequate publicity. The notification by letters and booklets to residents, introduced when the Clean Air Act was first operated, continues to be successful. There has been a minimum of upheaval and inconvenience to residents and no complaints have been received. -55- Following confirmation of the Orders by the Minister, Public Meetings were held in respect of the Abbey Wood No. 2, Clothworkers Wood, Abbey Wood No. 3, and Coldharbour Areas. At all these meetings the halls were full and many questions were asked by residents, indicating the interest shown in the Council's Clean Air activities. The demonstration caravan was in use in each of these Areas, and 3tayed at least a week on different sites. Many residents visited the unit to inspect the three solid fuel approved appliances installed burning coke. It is staffed by members of the Health Department. A representative selection of appliances and fuels available is also displayed in the Department's waiting room. SOOT NUISANCE During the year complaints were received from local residents regarding a nuisance caused by sooty flakes from an oil burning boiler installation at a local hospital. The Hospital Management Committee readily co-operated with the Council in dealing with this nuisance. Modifications were carried out to the oil burners, the flue was cleaned and dust control plant was installed. Considerable improvement followed and no further complaints have been received. NEW FURNACES Section 3 of the Clean Air Act requires that new furnaces not used mainly for domestic purposes and exceeding a capacity of 55,000 B.T.U's shall, as far as practicable, be smokeless. Any person installing such a furnace must give prior notice to the Council and may submit detailed plans and specifications for the Council's approval before the work of installation takes place. During 1960 one application for prior approval was received in respect of the installation of a new boilerhouse at the local Abattoir. In addition, two notifications were received of proposals to alter boiler plant with a maximum rating of less than 55,000 B.T.U's.

Film shows and talks, or talks alone, continue to be the most effective method of dissemination of health propaganda. This was clearly demonstrated by the many letters of appreciation received, and the raising of points bearing on the programmes. Many new organisations were visited and a number of requests for repeat visits were received. The average audience showed an increase in size over previous years, although individual audiences varied, as usual, from between 300 at one old people's club to 25 at other sessions. The estimated total attendances for the year was over 5,000. The subjects chosen varied widely, as can be seen in Table I below. Talks normally last about 20 minutes and film shows an hour. When the two are combined the films are adjusted so that the whole programme does not exceed 60 minutes.

Posters are displayed on a number of sites, and on the Department's transport. Much material is distributed to local organisations during visits by the Film Unit. In addition, the regular circulation to General Practitioners' surgeries and to factories was augmented throughout the year to include leaflets on topical matters, and especially the issue of Home Safety material during the autumn campaign. Much publicity is also given to the Council's activities in Smoke Control. This is more fully dealt with on page 55 of this Report. FOULING BY DOGS: WARNING NOTICES These notices, introduced in 1959, have been appreciated by the public and many requests are received for their display. There are signs that their display in an area does materially reduce the number of offences of this nature, and arrangements have been put in hand for a further supply to meet the increased demand. ACCIDENTS IN THE HOME Growing attention is being accorded to the problem of accidents in the home, due to the realisation that for every two deaths that occur on the roads, three occur in or around the home. It is becoming recognised that the modern home holds many snares for the careless and unwary. -59- In 1960 the number of cases removed to hospital by the London Ambulance Service from the area of the Borough as a result of a home accident was 443. Home accident cases removed by ambulance during the year from this area indicate that about three-quarters of the serious home accidents were caused by falls in or around the home. These included falls on stairs, from ladders, from chairs, and in the garden. Other home accident cases treated during the year included accidents from burns and scalds received from the use of the cooking stove and boiling water, from domestic fires, and from the teapot. Patients with knife-like wounds and suffering from poisoning, including gas poisoning, were also treated at the local hospitals. During the year, in furtherance of the need to give greater publicity to the home accident problem, over 200 local organisations were circularised as to their possible assistance in the distribution of Home Safety material. Nearly 70 replies were received, yielding a total demand for over 10,000 leaflets. Arrangements were put in hand for the supply of the necessary material. Early in the year, with the co-operation of the W.V.S., the leaflet "How to Avoid Falls" was distributed to local pensioners' clubs to bring home the danger, particularly to the elderly, of this type of home accident. The Council also took part in the Autumn Home Safety Campaign, and, with the assistance of supplies from the London County Council, over 2,000 leaflets dealing with falls and poisoning were distributed to local practitioners' surgeries and factories, workshops, etc. In addition, posters were displayed on many sites. PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE The following diseases are compulsorily notifiable in the Borough:— Anthrax, Cholera, Diphtheria, Dysentery, Encephalitis (Acute), Erysipelas, Enteric Fever, Food Poisoning, Leprosy, Malaria, Measles, -60- Membranous Croup, Meningococcal Infection, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, Pneumonia (Acute Primary), Pneumonia (Acute Influenzal), Poliomyelitis, Polio-encephalitis, Plague, Puerperal Pyrexia, Relapsing Fever, Scabies, Scarlet Fever (or Scarlatina), Smallpox, Tuberculosis (all forms), Typhoid Fever (including Paratyphoid), Typhus Fever, Whooping Cough, and Zymotic Enteritis. Cases of infectious disease notified to the Department are immediately visited by the Public Health Inspectors and disinfection is carried out wherever applicable. Where the patient is nursed at home, the Inspectors see that home isolation continues satisfactorily, and at the end of the infectious period, where necessary, the bedding belonging to the patient is removed for treatment at the Disinfecting Station and the rooms sealed and fumigated. The incidence of infectious disease in the Borough was very low during 1960 and gives rise for general satisfaction. No confirmed cases of diphtheria or poliomyelitis were reported. The total number of notifiable diseases occurring in the Borough was only 440, compared with 2,333 in the previous year. This drop was accounted for mainly by the small number of measles notifications received (only 19); this number being the lowest in the Borough on record. POLIOMYELITIS Only one case was notified during the year, and this proved not to be poliomyelitis. Four other patients were removed to hospital as suspected cases of poliomyelitis, the revised diagnoses being Meningitis (3 cases), and Bell's Palsy. DIPHTHERIA No confirmed case of Diphtheria occurred in the Borough. Three patients admitted to hospital as suspected cases were found to be suffering, from Bronchitis, Glandular Fever, and Tonsilitis. -61- FOOD POISONING One outbreak of food poisoning in the Borough occurred at an Old People's residence, when 18 persons were taken ill following a luncheon meal, which consisted of meat pie, gravy, mashed potatoes, carrots, and rice pudding. Two to three hours later three of the persons reported ill, and during the following night fifteen others were taken ill. In all cases the illness was mild and of between 6-l8 hours' duration. A number of the patients was found to be harbouring C. Welchii. The meat used for the pie had been cooked two days earlier and allowed to cool, and was then placed in a refrigerator; it was made into meat pies and gravy and further cooked on the morning of the day on which it was consumed. No specimens of the meal could be obtained for examination. Instructions were given by the Matron that there should be no more pre-cooking of meat. Four single cases of food poisoning were also notified during the year. In one case fried fish and chips which had been consumed by an Eltham young man after being re-heated were suspected. In another case canned meat was the food suspected as causing food poisoning in an elderly lady, and in another case poor food storage in the home may have been a contributory factor. In none of these cases was it possible to obtain bacteriological corroboration of the suspicions.

Full investigation of all new cases and their treatment is carried out by the local Chest Physician and her staff. There were only nine deaths of Woolwich residents from Tuberculosis in 1960, compared with 14 in the previous year.

Dr. Morgan reports as follows:- "A regular service to the Borough of Woolwich started on the 22nd January with a visit to Woolwich Market, Beresford Square. Since that date surveys have taken place in the Market on the second and fourth Thursdays in every month between 3.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m., and 4,180 people were x-rayed during the year. Of this number, 12 cases of tuberculosis requiring close supervision or treatment were discovered (2.9 per thousand) and 14 cases requiring occasional supervision (3.3 per thousand). The 12 "active" cases were found amongst the following groups:- MEN WOMEN Number X-rayed No. of Cases Number X-rayed No. of Cases Doctors' cases 106 1 102 1 Special Service for Men over 45 1,813 2 General Public 1,160 4 999 4 3,079 7 1,101 5 (2.3 per 1,000) (4.5 per 1,000) -64- Non-tuberculous abnormalities at these surveys were found as follows:- 8 Carcinoma of bronchus Hypertension Sarcoidosis 3 Bronchiectasis Inthra-thoracic Lipoma 7 Bronchitis & Emphysema Hamartoma Para-oesophageal hernia Eosinophilia of lung 3 Pleural thickening Retention cyst Raised left diaphragm 16 Pneumonitis During surveys at firms and factories (mainly in connection with the Special Service for men over 45) and at a training college, 3,902 people were x-rayed and two cases of tuberculosis reauirine close supervision or treatment were found. The results were:- MEN WOMEN Number X-rayed No. of Cases Number X-rayed No. of Cases Special Service for men over 45. 3,414 1 — — "Routine" X-rays 60 - 428 1 3,474 1 428 1 (0.3 per 1,000) (2.3 per 1,000) Non-tuberculous abnormalities at these surveys were as follows:— 2 Carcinoma of bronchus Spontaneous pneumothorax 5 Pneumonitis Congenital abnormality of rib 2 Bronchitis Small hiatus hernia Interstitial fibrosis Abnormal costal cartilage Emphysema It will be noted that from the figures of 2,159 general public volunteers who attended at the unit at Beresford Square, 8 cases of significant tuberculosis were discovered. This finding demonstrates the importance of regular x-ray facilities available to the public at a central and well-known site. In addition, 6 further cases were discovered among other groups. Furthermore, at Beresford Square 9 cases of bronchial carcinoma were found. -65- The value of this site is therefore self-evident and I would like to express my gratitude to the Borough Council and the Police, who have jointly made our visits possible." AUTHENTICATION OF CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION Persons proceeding abroad are required to produce in certain countries evidence of recent successful vaccination or inoculation. The signatures on these certificates are not acceptable by the countries concerned unless authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health as being the bona fide signature of a Doctor practising within the area. During 1960, 501 certificates were authenticated by me, 439 relating to protection against Smallpox, 4l for Cholera, and 21 for T.A.B. inoculation. PERSONAL CLEANSING The Borough Council maintains two personal cleansing stations, one being at Plumstead (adjoining the Turkish Baths in Plumstead High Street), and the other at the Lionel Road Centre,Eltham. The number of persons cleansed in 1960 was 423, and the number treated for scabies was 36. DISINFECTION AND PISINFESTATION The Department during 1960 carried out disinfection of 104 rooms following notification of infectious disease. 13 of these rooms had been occupied by persons suffering with tuberculosis. Well over a thousand inspections for vermin were also carried out during the course of the year, and 461 rooms were found to be in a verminous condition. All the verminous rooms were subsequently disinfested. 38 requests were received from local residents wishing to dispose of unwanted furniture or bedding. In the majority of cases the articles were old and worn out and sometimes verminous. Altogether some 320 items were collected and taken to the Plumstead Destructor to be destroyed. Of this total, 28 were mattresses, 30 bedsteads, 17 sets of bedding, 158 pieces of furniture, and 87 sundry items. -66- Certificates of Hygiene were issued to accompany 6 consignments of rag-wipers which had been washed, cleaned and sterilised by a local firm who specialise in the export of rag and other waste material wipers. LABORATORY FACILITIES A large part of the Council's pathological and allied work in relation to the diagnosis, prevention and control of infectious diseases is undertaken at the Southern Group Laboratory at the Hither Green Hospital, Lewisham. This service is provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service. Specimens sent to this Laboratory include samples of milk and ice-cream, samples of food in suspected food poisoning cases, specimens of meat from the Abattoir, and samples of swimming bath water. The following summary relates to the work carried out by the Laboratory on behalf of the Council during 196O:- Type of Specimen No. Examined Food (various) 8 Ice-cream (methylene blue test) 14 Milk (methylene blue, phosphatase and turbidity tests) 266 Water (swimming baths, children's paddling and boating pools) 32 Organs from animal carcases (Sections) 2 Sterilisation Test Envelopes 2 324 The examination of specimens of human origin (mainly swab examinations) for the general practitioners in the Borough, and also specimens referred to the Hospital from local clinics, is undertaken by the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee at the Brook Hospital and at the St. Nicholas Hospital. Once more I must express my appreciation of the efficient service of these Bodies. Often they go to considerable trouble to help us with' extraordinary specimens. -67- TABLE OF CONTENTS Page Preface 2 Health Committee 5 Staff 5 General Statistics 7 Vital Statistics 8 Public Health Administration 16 Housing 31 Inspection and Supervision of Food 39 Clean Air 49 Health Education 58 Infectious Diseases (including Disinfection, 60 Disinfestation and Personal Cleansing) Laboratory Facilities 67
