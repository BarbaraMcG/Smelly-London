THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH BEING THE REPORT FOR THE YEAR 189O. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, In presenting the Thirty-fifth Annual Report a few words calling attention to the more important events that have taken place daring the year in your Health Department form a fitting introduction to the more elaborated portions of the report which I have the honour to lay before you. The increase in the Staff of the Department by which a Chief Clerk and four unattached Sanitary Inspectors have been added and the reorganization resulting therefrom have already impressed a marked change for good on the work of the Department. Equipped with the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, with the Regulations for Houses let in Tenements, framed under the Sanitary Acts of 1866 and 1874, passed by your Vestry during the year and confirmed by the Local Government Board last August, and with a complete code of Drainage Regulations adopted by your Vestry later on, it will be possible in the future to render a better account of the work accomplished by your Health Department than in the past. One important matter of organization remains still uncompleted, namely, the institution of a proper periodical collection of domestic refuse the lines on which this should be organized will be found fully described under the head of Refuse Removal in the body of the report. It is much to be desired that your Vestry should complete this matter at as early a date as possible, with the stringent clauses of the Public Health (London) Bill, looming in the distance. With regard to disease, the Influenza committed havoc at the commencement of the year of which due cognizance is taken below. The low vital condition of Somers Town is a matter of some bearing in connection with the insanitary condition of certain areas. Possible reasons for the increased mortality from diphtheria daring the last three years are found discussed under the proper head. The additional legislation upon infectious diseases has necessitated and facilitated what previously could not be attempted, namely, the organisation of a method by which the prevention of infectious diseases may work so smoothly as to be almost automatic. The manner in which this takes place is described under the head of Notification. The Infectious Disease Prevention Act besides facilitating procedure in the prevention of disease has imposed an important duty and responsibility upon Local Authorities in making it compulsory to provide temporary shelter during disinfection for the poor whose limit of dwelling accommodation is restricted to one or two rooms. In the absence of a shelter and of any instructions from your Vestry your Health Department has no alternative but to offer the shelter of the Vestry Hall to the refugees. Some points in connection with the provision of a shelter will be found in the body of the Report under disinfection. Other points of interest need scarcely be raised here and it is desirable to proceed to the more detailed report commencing as usual with a meteorological summary for the past year. 6 METEOROLOGY OF LONDON, 1890.

PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Average population.—During the 53 weeks of the year 1890, the average daily number of inmates in Public Institutions situated in St. Pancras, exclusive of resident officers, was as follows :— Institutions in St. Pancras. Number of Inmates. Sub-Districts. Number of Inmates. St. Saviour's Cancer Hospital 30 Regent's Park 30 University College Hopital 160 Tottenham Court 425 Home Hospital 15 ,, ,, Medical and Surgical Home ,, ,, Central London Sick Asylum 250 ,, ,, Royal Free Hospital 150 Gray's Inn lane 170 Central London Throat and Ear Hospital 15 ,, ,, Homes of Hope 5 ,, ,, Temperance Hospital 50 Somers Town 50 North-West London Hospital 35 Camden Town 1535 Workhouse 1500 ,, ,, Infirmary 500 Kentish Town 500 2710 2710 It is assumed that the number of inmates of the above institutions, who do not belong to St. Pancras is equal to the number of inmates, belonging to St. Pancras, in Non-Parochial Institutions, as Hospitals, &c., situated beyond the limits of the Parish. But the St. Pancras inmates of Poor Law Institutions situated beyond the limits of the Parish must be added to the above. Institutions situated beyond St. Pancras.

POPULATION. The population as enumerated on April 5th, 1891, appears to be approximated as stated in the table below, and for the purpose of comparison previous census populations are included, and a diagram of the population census of the SubDistricts appended. CENSUS POPULATION OF ST. PANCRAS AND SUB-DISTRICTS. Sub-Districts. 1851 1861 1871 1881 1891 Difference. 1881-1891 Regent's Park 31918 34927 38200 39115 36592 —2523 Tottenham Court 28433 29371 29370 27729 26319 —1410 Gray's Inn Lane 26522 27808 29221 30247 27448 —2799 Somers Town 36541 39099 38533 34369 32841 —1528 Camden Town 21115 23266 17943 17311 15461 —1850 Kentish Town 33326 44317 68198 87487 95776 + 8289 St. Pancras 166965 198788 211465 236258 234437 —1821 There were at the time of this last census a reduced number of inmates in the Workhouse (Camden Town Sub-District) the houses in the Polygon (Somers Town Sub-District) were unoccupied preparatory to demolition, and many houses on a large area on the north side of Cromer Street (Gray's Inn Lane Sub-District) were demolished, it is therefore justifiable to estimate the population of St. Pancras as stationary. There is no apparent reason why the population of Regent's Park Sub-District should have shrunken so markedly, but in Tottenham Court and Gray's Inn Sub-Districts many dwelling houses have been converted into workshops and stores. The number of persons in the Sub-Districts taken singly has therefore varied considerably although the population of the whole Parish has remained approximately stationary. The estimated population for 1890 of the Parish and Sub-Districts has been calculated from the Census figures of 1891. The inmates of Public Institutions have been first deducted and then the number of these added to the inmates of the Extra-Parochial Poor Law Institutions have been redistributed to the Sub-Districts in proportion to populations. This last addition is necessary because the deaths in these Extra Parochial Poor-Law Institutions are included in the St. Pancras mortality. The result of the estimation is stated in the following table and the figures of the second column are those adopted. 9 ESTIMATED POPULATION, 1890. Sub-Districts. Gross. Corrected and Re-Distributed. Regent's Park 36781 37471 Tottenham Court 26424 26509 Gray's Inn Lane 27658 28028 Somers Town 32955 33545 Camden Town 15599 14344 Kentish Town 95155 96535 St. Pancras 234572 236432 MARRIAGES. The number of Marriages celebrated in St. Pancras during the year was 2098, being 87 more than in the preceding year and 63 more than the annual average for the preceding decennium. BIRTHS. The number of Births registered in the Parish during the year was 6999, being 299 less than the number of the preceding year and 646 less than the average for the preceding ten years. The 188 births occurring in Public Institutions having been redistributed the numbers of births and birth-rates in the Sub-Districts were as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number of Births. Birth-rate. Regent's Park 923 24.6 Tottenham Court 664 25.0 Gray's Inn Lane 818 29.2 Somers Town 1116 33.3 Camden Town 476 33.2 Kentish Town 3002 31.1 St.Pancras 6999 29.6 London 130,690 31.2 DEATHS. During the 53 weeks of the year 1890 the corrected number of deaths from ail causes at all ages, of St. Pancras parishioners was 5151, a number higher than in any other year during the preceding decennium, and 375 above the average for 10 the ten years. The corrected death rate per 1000 of population living was 21.8 or or 3 per 1000 higher than in the preceding year and 1.6 higher than the average for the preceding decennium. The number of deaths and the death-rates in the Sub-Districts were as follows, 313 deaths from all causes not referable to any particular Sub Districts being distributed according to population.

Zymotic Diseases. The principal Zymotic Diseases were the cause of 646 deaths compared with 498 in the previous year, and an annual average during the previous ten years of 689.6 The number of deaths and the proportions per 1000 of population and per 1000 of total deaths were as follows :— Sub-Districts. Number. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 Total Deaths. Regent's Park 80 2.13 101.3 Tottenham Court 61 2.30 102.3 Gray's Inn Lane 82 2.93 123.5 Somers Town 120 3.58 138.7 Camden Town 36 2.51 111.8 Kentish Town 276 2.77 139.5 St. Pancras 646 2.73 131.4 London 12,279 2.93 134.6 12 During the year there were registered in St. Pancras no deaths from either small-pox or typhus fever, and only one death from continued fever, from enteric fever 22, and from scarlet fever 27 deaths. The number of deaths from each of the principal zymotic diseases was below the average during the year, with the notable exception of diphtheria, which in gross number of deaths ranks with the more common children's diseases, namely, measles, whooping cough, and diarrhoea. Diphtheria.—The number of deaths from Diphtheria and Membranous Croup in 1888 was 72, in 1889 was 62, and in 1890 increased to 141. This increase was coincident with the commencement of the operations of the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act at the end of October, 1889. The increase has been not only in the number of notified cases, as might be expected, but also in the number of deaths registered, reference to the tables appended will show the number of deaths occurring monthly throughout the last three years. It is evident that there is some connection between Notification and the increase of mortality from diphtheria and membranous croup. It is possible that a proportion of deaths formerly certified as due to tonsillitis, sore throat or quinsey, possibly also to croup and laryngitis, may now be certified as due to diphtheria. It is also possible that deaths from scarlatinal sore throat may be similarly certified. The reason for the deaths being so certified might in a measure be attributable to the fact that the diseases causing the deaths had already been so certified to the Medical Officer of Health under the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act. Although the number of deaths from diphtheria are annually increasing in the Metropolis, the sudden accession to the number in St. Pancras, is incomprehensible unless it be assumed that it is highly probable that some variation in diagnosis or nomenclature is the cause of part of the increase at least. Disinfection has been most fully and most carefully carried out in all cases during the period and the complete process of fumigation of interiors, disinfection of clothing bedding, &c., by high pressure steam, and stripping and cleansing of walls, ceilings and floors carried through. Isolation has been equally carefully increased, during 1888 no cases of diphtheria were received into the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospitals, in 1889 St. Pancras sent 6, which number in 1890 was increased to 94. Notification does not appear to have had a corresponding effect upon the number of deaths from any of the other diseases notifiable. Compare the tables for the three years 1888, 1889 and 1890, which follow. Reference to tables 8B and C in the appendix points to Camden Town as being the central focus of the disease. 13 Deaths from notifiable Infectious Diseases during 1888.

Influenza.—The epidemic of this disease commenced in December, 1889, but the period of extensive prevalence was reached as 1890 commenced. For some months previously an Influenza was prevalent amongst horses and the number sick in four of the largest stables (A B C and D) in St. Pancras was ascertained to be as follows :— Sept. Oct. Not. Dec. Jan. Total No. sick. Total No. of horses A — 109 155 75 29 359 850 B — 12 40 13 9 74 203 C — 20 35 25 20 100 330 D 13 67 132 21 — 233 1200 Total 13 208 362 134 58 775 2583 There is little doubt that the disease amongst human beings is highly communicable. It followed the main lines of human communication and travelled pari passu with the rapidity and frequency of the communication. For instance, whereas it sped across Europe in a few weeks, it took a few months to reach the remote valleys of Yorkshire. There accumulating virulence to re-attack in the following year the towns from whence it was despatched to them. The disease frequently spread in consecutive manner to different members of the same family. The inculation period appears to be very short, instances being given of the intervention of only a few hours. The more highly infectious a disease, the shorter the inculation period, and the greater the number of persons susceptible, the more closely does it resemble diseases spread by malarial, telluric or atmospheric influences, hence the term of Influenza. lhe following tables, extracted from a specially printed report made during the year by your Medical Officer of Health, place upon record the vital statistics of the epidemic. 17 London and St. Pancras.—Deaths from Influenza, Respiratory Diseases, and Total Deaths.

The Respiratory Diseases which numbered 975 in 1S88 fell to 871 in 1889, and rose to 1147 in 1890, the incidence was as follows: — Sub-Districts. Numbers. per 1000 population. per 1000 deaths. Regent's Park 169 4.51 213.9 Tottenham Court 123 4.64 206.4 Gray's Inn Lane 173 6.17 260.5 Somers Town 203 6.05 234.7 Camden Town 75 5.30 232.9 Kentish Town 404 4.18 242.4 St. Pancras 1147 4.85 222.7 London 21186 5.07 232.2 VIOLENT DEATHS. Yioleuc6 was the cause of 1(55 deaths during 1890 the numbers for 1889 and 1888 being 177 and 1-57 respectively. 19 UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. The uncertified deaths registered were 9 in number, having been 5 in the two previous years. INQUESTS. During the year 448 inquests were held in St. Pancras, of which 422 were conducted in the Coroner's Court. In the previous year the number held was 431. COMPARATIVE VITALITY OF THE SUB-DISTRICTS. Reviewing the comparative figures in the preceding tables the Sub-Districts would appear to range themselves in an order of vital condition somewhat as follows :—Kentish Town, Regent's Park, Camden Town, Tottenham Court, Gray's Inn Lane, Somers Town. The general tendency from end to end of the Parish is for the conditions and vitality to deteriorate in approaching the older and more central districts of London, a result that might be more or less anticipated. But it is evident that Somers Town stands lowest in all the tests of vital condition, almost without exception. This is the most prominent feature of the comparative figures. INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

On April 29th a case in Liverpool Street, Gray's Inn Road, was certified, and was removed to hospital, but was shortly returned diagnosed as measles. On May 12th a case in Camden Street, Camden Town, was certified and recovered at home, but having regard to the fact that at the same date several others in the same school fell ill with undoubted chicken pox, there was little doubt that this also was a case of chicken pox. 20 The seasonal incidence of the infectious diseases is shown in the following table:— Monthly distribution of the Cases of Infectious Diseases certified to the Department throughout the Year 1890.

The method of carrying out the Infectious Disease Notification and Infectious Disease Prevention Acts, smoothly and expeditiously has been organised during the year. Whenever a case of infectious disease, included in the Acts, comes to the knowledge of the Health Department, either through notification or information from any source, and a medical certificate has not been received the name and address of the medical attendant are ascertained and a printed immediately forwarded to him pointing out that a certificate has not yet been received and calling his attention to Sections 3, 4 and 6, printed on the flyleaf. The necessity for this course has gradually become less, the Medical Certificates being now received with reasonable promptitude. Upon receipt of the Medical Certificate the person in charge or the patient is informed, by private circular, that a person of the name, age and address given has been certified to be suffering from the disease mentioned, a notice is enclosed in accordance with the Infectious Disease Prevention Act, and attention is called therein to the prohibition of the wrongful disposal of infectious rubbish, and the obligation to disinfect and cleanse infected houses, and the process of disinfection required by the Medical Officer of Health in each of the infectious diseases is detailed. A return-letter is also enclosed, with a request that it be sent to the Medical Officer of Health when the premises are ready for disinfection and cleansing, and a foot-note of the resolution of the Vestry is attached to the effect that disinfection is performed gratuitously during the day, but that it will be carried out during the night, if so desired, upon payment of a reasonable extra charge. The Sanitary Inspector visits the premises and makes enquiry as to the place of clothes-washing, milk-supply, school, or work place attended, source of infection, and observes that others are subject to no risks of infection; notes the date when disinfection will be required, and inspects and records the sanitary condition of the premises, and if any sanitary work requires to be done notice is served to that effect. The School being ascertained, the Head Teacher is confidentially informed that the pupil is suffering from infectious disease and is requested not to re-admit the pupil until furnished with a Certificate of Disinfection. Upon receipt of the return-letter, or upon removal of the patient to hospital, or upon complete recovery, or in case of death, upon removal of the body, a formal notice is served detailing the disinfection and cleansing necessary, and the disinfectors fumigate the room or rooms, and remove and return, or destroy the infected articles of clothing, bedding, &c. The processes of disinfection necessary will be found described in the Annual Report of last year. 22 The disinfection completed a Certificate is given to the patient or the person in charge that it has been done satisfactorily. But as Certificates of Disinfection cannot be given to all the members of a family, and to all the occupiers of a house, a foot-note is appended requesting the person requiring the certificate not to confiscate it, so that it is available for the other occupants of the house. It may be added that the disinfectors are provided with printed counterfoil lists of articles to be disinfected or destroyed, which are filled up and are signed before removal and after return. Also with counterfoil receipts for fees paid for disinfection over night. The practical effect of the Notification Act during the year has been to bring to the knowledge of the Health Department nearly three times the number of cases of infectious diseases as compared with the previous year, although during the last two months of that year the Act was in force, this has entailed a large increase of work. ISOLATION. The cases of Infectious Diseases removed to hospitals and the Sub-Districts whence they were removed, are recorded in the following table for 1890:— Diseases Isolated. Regent's Park.

The last is of less importance, for although attendants upon typhoid cases, if young adults, are very liable to contract the disease it is not highly infectious, but Diphtheria is a highly infectious disease, not only through direct aerial medium but also indirectly through fomites as clothing, furniture, and surfaces generally, to which the infection tenaciously clings. The Notification Act has resulted in the transference to hospital of more than twice the number of infectious cases so treated in the previous year. The regulations of the Ambulance Service of the Metropolitan Asylums Board are set out in your Medical Officer's Annual report for 1889. VACCINATION.

During the year the effect of the Notification Act has also been to materially increase the amount of disinfection. The number of rooms fumigated has almost doubled, the number of articles disinfected has more than doubled, and almost four times as many articles have been destroyed by fire as in the previous year. Rooms fumigated (the owners or occupiers stripping and cleansing) 692. ARTICLES. Destroyed.

Covers 50 — ..... Curtains 52 15 Sundries 319 440 Total 7447 Transport.—The large amount of disinfection could not have been coped with if it had not been for the rapidly working disinfecting chamber erected in the previous year, of which a full description was given in my report for 1889, and also the addition of a third disinfector to assist in the transport. The transport was felt to be the weakest link in the chain, manual labour not being sufficiently rapid to keep pace with the working of the apparatus, the distances to and fro sometimes exceeding four miles over hilly ground. Towards the close of the year your Yestry therefore decided to have two capacious vans constructed, one for infected and the other for disinfected articles, to be properly horsed and driven. Shelter.—By the Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890, section 15, it is enacted that the local authority shall provide, free of charge, temporary shelter or house accommodation with any necessary attendants for the members of any family in which any infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected, and your Yestry is the local authority under the Act. Up to the present moment persons seeking shelter have used the rooms in the basement of the Vestry Hall, pending the endeavours made to procure premises for the purpose. Hitherto these endeavours have proved fruitless, and appear very unlikely to be successful. Under these circumstances no alternative will be left to your Vestry but to procure a conveniently situated piece of ground and construct thereon the necessary accommodation. In making provision of this kind the opportunity of providing for personal disinfection should not be lost. On the Continent the system is being carried out 26 of disinfecting the clothing of members of the infected family whilst they are cleansing their persons by douches. The class who would find it necessary to use the shelter would be the very class whose persons and clothing must become saturated with infection from the close contact into which they are driven by the limited space of one or at the most of two rooms. To send back to rooms that have been disinfected persons saturated with infection without any attempt of personal cleansing is running an unnecessary risk and undoing the work of disinfection. But to fail to supply to those who being homeless desire to practice personal cleanliness and rid themselves of all trace of infection would in addition cast a serious responsibility upon the local authority. The erection of a few douches is not a very costly matter, and their conjunction with the Shelter would relieve your Yestry of any responsibility for want of provision for personal cleanliness and the prevention of re-infection. Your Vestry Hall is a most undesirable placs for the Shelter of persons wearing infected clothing, and attempts to procure the use of existing buildings for the purpose having failed, the erection of a temporary structure on a piece of vacant ground within reasonable distance of the Vestry Hall is the course that remains available. SANITATION. STAFF. At the commencement of the year 1889 the request of the London County Council to be furnished with details of all the insanitary areas in St. Pancras was under consideration. In the Monthly Report of your Medical Officer of Health, for April of that year, it was pointed out that this would entail a large amount of labour, and that the then staff was more than fully employed, St. Pancras possessing considerably less than half the number of Sanitary Inspectors in proportion to the six surrounding parishes. Subsequently a Conjoint Report less detailed than originally contemplated was furnished by your Chief Surveyor and Medical Officer. With the advent of the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act in November, 1889, the great strain falling upon the work of the. Sanitary Department was again reported to your Sanitary Committee and the impossibility of keeping pace with the varied and growing number of calls upon the time of the officers explained. In December your Sanitary Committee finding that house to house inspections where rapidly falling off, recommended your Vestry to increase the number of Sanitary Inspectors. Meanwhile, difficulties having arisen in reference to the Conjoint Report upon Insanitary Areas your Vestry, on January loth, 1890, appointed a Special Committee of Inquiry into the Sanitary Department. Your Special Committee considered the organisation and control of the clerical and legal work, the supervision of the collection and removal of domestic and other refuse, the regulation and supervision of drainage work, and the staff necessary. The number of complaints, infectious cases, articles disinfected, and houses inspected from house to house, during the last five years were submitted to your Special Committee as follows :— 1886 1887 1888 1889 1890 Complaints 592 667 736 902 1248 Infectious Cases Notified 353 634 681 609 1623 Articles Disinfected . . 2260 2748 3488 7447 Houses Inspected House to • • 2660 1674 693 388 27 It was shown that as the number of complaints, notifications of infectious diseases, and disinfections increased, so the number of house to house inspections decreased, leading to continuous overtime work and neglect of many regular inspections of food, trade and other premises. Upon the recommendation of the Special Committee your Yestry, on 8th October, 1890, decided to transfer the duties of the Vestry connected with the removal of dust and house refuse from the Works to the Sanitary Department, and the supervision of the construction of underground drainage from the Sanitary to the Works Department, and in order to facilitate the work of the officers of both Departments adopted a code of Regulations respecting house drainage. Subsequently upon the recommendation of the Special Committee your Vestrv, on 19th November, resolved to appoint a Chief Clerk of the Sanitary Department to dispense with the services of the nine dust inspectors and to appoint four additional Sanitary Inspectors. It was also resolved that the four existing Inspectors should be appointed Divisional Sanitary Inspectors, each to take charge of one of the four Parliamentary Divisions of the Parish, and that the four new inspectors should be unattached Sanitary Inspectors available at all times and places and for all purposes. Subsequently in 1891 your Vestry decided to change the name of the Department from Sanitary to that of Heath Department. The staff of the Health Department now consists of the Medical Officer of Health, the Chief Clerk and three other Clerks, four Divisional Sanitary Inspectors, four Unattached Sanitary Inspectors, a Caretaker of the Mortuary Buildings, three Disinfectors, and an Office Messenger. OPEN SPACES. The parks, public gardens and other open spaces secured against building operations in St. Pancras, together with their situation, approximate area, and the authority under which they are maintained are enumerated in the following table:— Garden or Open Spaces.

House to House Inspections have been carried on during the year in diminished proportions as explained above and in the previous Annual Report. The increase in the Staff will enable these inspections in future to be better maintained. Tenement Houses, or houses let in lodgings to members of more than one family, as they are technically but inconveniently termed in sec. 35 of the Sanitary Act of 1866, and sec. 47 of the Sanitary Law Amendment Act of 1874, are now embraced within more efficient control by your Yestry having adopted Bye-laws for their regulation, that were confirmed by the Local Government Board, 30th August, 1890. It is unnecessary to reproduce these regulations here, as they are printed under separate cover. The main points, besides making the usual sanitary provisions, are that every person is to be allowed 300 cubic feet of space in a sleeping room, and 400 cubic feet in a room used both for living and sleeping purposes, that W.C.'s are to be provided for every 12 persons, and that whenever ' common use, or use by two or more occupiers of any part of the house or premises is shown, the onus is thrown upon the landlord of maintaining cleanliness or of providing for its maintenance. Block Duellings remain as in the previous year, and details in reference to them will be found as usual in the table in the appendix. Common Lodging Houses are set out in the table in the appendix. Two important points require consideration in connection with this class of dwellings. Firstly, the more distinct separation of the houses provided for each sex. The houses provided for males, for females, and for married couples, should be kept rigidly distinct, and quarters for married couples should not be permitted to exist in houses provided for either single females or males. Secondly, the Sanitary Authorit}' should have joint control with the police over these dwellings. At present, the Sanitary Bye-laws for this class of house are drawn up by the Police and not by the Sanitary authority, and under them constables, instead of sanitary inspeclois enforce the suppression of nuisances. Underground Dwellings. During the year 64 notices of the Yestry were served upon the owners or occupiers of underground dwellings, ordering them to cease to occupy such basement rooms or cellars as dwellings or to comply with the structural requirements of section 103 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. Canal Boats, Caravans, and Tents call for no special comment. Insanitary Areas.—Referring to the Insanitary Areas first brought under consideration during 1889, and mentioned in the Report of that year—Wait's Place and Pasemore Place were demolished, and on the Cromer Street area, Melina Place, North Terrace, Argyle Place, Riley Street, Dutton Street, Wood Street, Brighton Street (southern end), and Tonbridge Street (east side of southern end), have been demolished, and the East End Dwellings Company are commencing to erect Block Dwellings upon the sites. The three areas not yet dealt with, namely, CI) Churchway, Elizabeth Court, York Buildings, &c. ; (2) Prospect Terrace and Derry Street, and (3) North Crescent Mews and Brantome Place have been since February 12th, 1891, represented to the London County Council under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. 29 Artizans Dwellings Act, 1868, (Torrens') and its Amendments.—In last year's Annual Report a complete list of houses represented under these Acts durinsr the previous ten years is to be found. Certain of the proceedings were incomplete and therefore could not appear in the list, the Acts having been since repealed, th( following complete the proceedings taken under the Acts up to the date of repeal Date of Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

With the exception of the narrow strip lying between Albany Street and Regent's Park, St. Pancras is supplied with water on the constant system, and separate flush cisterns or water waste preventors for closets are therefore in general use. With the water-supply in the hands of a public body a better prospect would be offered for improvements in flushing. Flushing cisterns for closets should be limited to a maximum of three gallons, and a minimum of two, instead of as at present being restricted to a maximum of two gallons, and frequently considerably under this. It is to the interests of water companies to encourage the uso of the smallest sized flush-cisterns and to decline to acknowledge or stamp any cistern exceeding two gallons in capacity. A public body would probably also afford greater facilities for sewer-flushing. The efficiency of flushing lies not in the long-continued flow of a moderate quantity of water, but in the sudden discharge of a huge volume. In more than one large town, openings in the sewers are carried up to the surface, and down these large openings several tons of water are discharged suddenly from a water-van, driven to and stationed over the mouth. But the construction at the heads of sewers of underground automatic tanks to contain two or three tons of water, would be a still more satisfactory method of sewer flushing. Public Baths and Washhouses.— The public washing and bathing establishments in Whitfield Street, Tottenham Court Road, and in King Street, High Street, Camden Town, continue to serve the purpose for which they were intended, but it would be a great advantage if baths and washhouses on a smaller scale were attached by the owners to every collection of Block Dwellings. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. In the month of October, your Vestry resolved that the laying of drains and the examination and amendment of all underground drainage should be supervised by your Works Department, but that drainage above ground and works connected therewith, other than underground drainage, remain under the supervision of your Sanitary Department. In order that this division might successfully work, your Vestry adopted fixed Regulations for House Drainage, as a guide to the Officers of both Departments. Regulations respecting House Drainage. (1.) That all drains be constructed according to deposited plans, to be approved previously by the Surveyor. (2.) All drains shall be made of glazed stoneware or cast-iron pipes. When stoneware pipes are used they shall be socket pipes of the best quality, and shall be jointed with cement made of two parts of clean sharp sand and one part of best Portland cement by measure, and so as to be watertight, and where fixed inside the house shall be embedded in concrete at least six inches in thickness all round, made with one part of clean sharp sand, five parts of clean ballast, and one part of the best Portland cement; main drains shall be at least six inches iu internal diameter and branch drains at least four inches in internal diameter. When cast-iron pipes are used they shall be socket pipes of best quality and heavy metal, and coated internally with Dr. Angus Smith's or 32 some other approved, anti-corrosive composition; the joints shall be caulked with lead and the pipes not less than 6 inches internal diameter for main drains, and 4 inches for branch drains. (8.) The interior of such pipes, after being laid, shall be cleared from any projecting portions of cement. (4.) The drain is not to be filled or covered in until it has been inspected and tested by the Surveyor or by any other Officer of the Works Department. (5.) No drain shall be laid on the premises until the drain from the sewer to the premises has been laid in accordance with the regulations of the Vestry. (6.) The drains on the premises shall be laid in straight lines wherever possible and with an even and regular inclination from the lowest level upwards, to the approval of the Surveyor. (7.) Each house shall have a separate drain in direct communication with a sewer unless express consent from the Vestry has been obtained for combined drainage. (8.) So much of the work as may be necessary for the connection to the sewer to the extent of a flap trap (if required), and six feet of pipe will be constructed by the Vestry's contractor, at the expense of the owner and such an amount as shall be required by the Vestry's Surveyor must be paid as deposit, previous to the commencement of the work. (9.) An interceptor syphon trap shall be placed in the drain on the premises as near as possible to the sewer, and beyond all branch connections, and an inspection chamber provided, or syphon only, of approved pattern as will be directed : and where practicable, with an inlet for the admission of air, the mouth of such inlet shall be constructed in such a manner as to prevent the admission of solid matters into the drain. (10.) At the highest part of the drain, a pipe at least four inches in internal diameter shall be fixed for the purpose of ventilating the drain, and shall be carried up to such a height without bends or angles (except where unavoidable), as will afford a safe outlet for all gases. (11.) The junction pipes used in the drains shall be those known as Y junctions. (12.) The inlets to the drains shall be properly trapped with fixed traps, except inlets used for the purpose of ventilation. Traps known as "bell," "lip," or " dip," traps shall not be inserted in the drains. The inlets to the drains shall be outside of the house, except the necessary inlets connected with water-closets. (13.) The yard gully shall be at least six inches in diameter, and shall have an outlet connected with the drain at least four inches in diameter, and shall be covered with an iron, or other approved grating. (14.) The waste pipes from scullery sinks, baths and lavatories, and all pipes conveying foul matters to the drains from inside the house (except soil pipes from water-closets), and every rain water pipe, excepting such as may be used for the purpose of ventilation, shall be made to discharge over or into a gully connected with the drain outside the house. (15.) Drains shall not be laid under any part of a house, if it be practicable to lay them outside of the house, and in all newly erected structures the soil pipe of every water closet shall be of lead or iron and shall be placed outside and shall not be less than four inches in internal diameter. (16.) The soil pipe shall be continued without diminution of diameter upward from its junction with the water-closet without bends or angles (except where unavoidable), to such a height and position as will afford a safe outlet for foul gases. 33 (17.) The joints of the soil pipes, ventilating pipes, rain water pipes, and all other pipes discharging into the drain shall be made air-tight. (18.) Every water-closet shall be provided with suitable apparatus for effectually flushing the basin which shall be of such a shape as will be self-cleansing with the flush of water discharged into it.—Note. The Yestry disapprove of "D "traps, and pan closets. Note.—The Vestry are empowered to open ground to inspect any drain, or works connected therewith, that may be covered over. In order to avoid the annoyance and inconvenience occasioned by opening ground and uncovering work, persons executing such work when it is ready for covering, should forthwith give notice to that effect to the Surveyor to the Vestry, when it will be inspected in due course. If on inspection of any work ordered by the Vestry it is found that the order of the Vestry has been departed from in any particular, the person so offending is liable to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds ; and if such person, after notice from the Vestry, neglect to amend such work, the Vestry may amend it at the expense of the person so offending. REFUSE REMOVAL. The removal of street refuse or slopping is carried out under the supervision of the Works Department. Stable and cowshed refuse or manure is collected by private contract, the Health Department enforcing its removal by occupiers, in accordance with the regulations, and trade refuse also, with few exceptions, is removed by private contract. The removal of domestic refuse has now become the duty of your Health Department. It is most desirable that the collection and removal of trade, and also of stable refuse should be kept distinct and separate from that of domestic refuse, and it would much simplify the dusting contract if it were unencumbered and separate contracts drawn for other purposes. The manner in which the dusting of the parish is carried on, under the present contraot, entails a great loss of time by the Sanitary Inspectors, as each complaint must be attended to in detail, and it is utterly impossible to properly control the dust men and carts, on account of the absence of any proper system of periodical collection. A regular periodical house to house collection is the only system under which the dusting of the parish can be adequately controlled and efficiently worked. Some difference of opinion may be expressed as to the period of time desirable to adopt, daily, bi-weekly, or weekly, but any interval longer than a week would be out of harmony with prevailing public opinion. The Polling Districts of the four Divisions of the Parish form blocks of convenient size, according to area, houses, and population, for the purpose of organising the system. It is most important to note that whether your Vestry undertakes the dusting or contracts with others to carry it out, the same organised system is necessary as a basis, and the points more requisite may be noted seriatim. Every contractor shall be supplied with a list of the streets and other places in each of the Polling Districts of the Division. These streets and other places shall be numbered or arranged on the list in the order in which the dust must be removed from them, the order being consecutive according to contiguity, and this order shall be strictly adhered to by the contractor, the dustmen and the dust carts. Every Monday morning a dust cart shall commence at the street or other place numbered one or first on the list, and call at and collect from every 34 house, from house to house in the street or other place, the domestic refuse accumulated during the week since the call of the previous cart. When completed, the cart shall proceed to the street or other place next on the list, and so on day by day until the whole of the streets and other places in the polling district shall have been traversed and completed by the said cart, and in such a manner that the carts shall follow one another through the district from house to house and street to street at intervals of one week. Every Monday morning the number of the cart, and the names of each of the men in attendance, commencing each district shall be given to the Medical Officer of Health, and any change in the men attending the cart shall be notified to him. A dust cart or van shall not be removed from its district or beat during the day, except to discharge or in case of accident, and no change shall take place without the consent of the Medical Officer of Health being first obtained, any such necessary change to take place with the commencement of the day. A dust cart or van leaving its beat to discharge shall upou return recommence collecting at the house next in order to that last visited. The carts specially set apart for collecting dust shall not collect trade refuse or any form of refuse for which removal is payable by the owner or occupier. In case any owner or occupier of premises refuses to have his dust removed at the periodical time when the cart calls, the Medical Officer of Health shall be so informed within twenty-four hours (Sundays excepted). The dustmen shall not neglect to call, knock, or ring at any house, tenement, or premises for the purpose of removing the domestic refuse. No sorting, totting, or searching of the dust shall take place either at the houses or in the streets from whence it is removed or in transit to the depot. Besides these provisions, special clauses are required in the contract to cover collection in certain streets and places as in the Euston Road before 10 a.m., in accordance with Police Regulations, also collection from public dustbins in courts and alleys, and from public buildings and large institutions as artizans block dwellings, hotels, eto. Penalties must be provided for all defaults, or every non-observance of the provisions of the contract. Small districts and monthly payments would materially facilitate the organisation of the system foreshadowed above. NUISANCES. Drain Nuisances are the most common form of nuisance, and generally the most easily abated. Trade Nuisances or those nuisances arising from offensive trades are mainly controlled by the Bye-laws, and under the inspection of the County Council. In the matter of trade nuisances, not controlled by Bye-laws, the Railway Companies are indirectly serious offenders. Railway Companies retain a firm grasp on land acquired. There are always small portions of ground not required for railway purposes at the time of purchase, but which are retained for future use. These vacant spaces, spoil-banks, etc., are expressly not built upon, in order to avoid present taxation and future demolition, but the thirst for profit is so great that they are under-let for the purpose of allowing some form of noxious trade to be carried on, such as dust and refuse shooting, brick-burning, etc. The Railway Companies, the original offenders, are shielded, and the sub-lesses make it their 35 business to circumvent the local authorities in carrying on profitable nuisances. If Railway Companies require reserve space they should only be permitted to retain it under properly limited conditions. The trouble your Yestry has had and still has with the vacant space east of College Lane, Highgate Road, amply demonstrates the truth of this statement in one instance, and many similar instances in the Metropolis are to be found. Marine Stores, premises on which much offensive material, such as rags and bones collect, were inspected carefully during the year. Fish Frying Shops have been carefully inspected, and most of them are now provided with more efficient hoods to carry off the offensive vapours. The Regent's Canal is occasionally complained of as a nuisance, and could be much improved by proper cleansing of the bottom, and more frequent change of surface water. It is to be regretted that there is no compulsion to empty and cleanse the canal annually. SUMMONSES. Under the Nuisances Removal, Sanitary, and Metropolis Local Management Acts.

FOOD PREMISES. The Slaughter-houses licensed in the Parish have during the year been kept in accordance with the Bye-Laws. The Cowsheds licensed have also been kept in compliance with the regulations, with one exception. The premises licensed to Mrs. Jones, in Edward Street, Hampstead Road, were not in an altogether satisfactory condition at the time of the Licensing Sessions, in November, but they have since been transferred to a new occupier and have improved. The Dairies and Milkshops, so far as the storage of Milk is concerned, are controlled by the County Council. Milkshops especially, require some limitation of the articles that may be dealt in on the same premises as such a perishable and absorbtive fluid as milk. The Bakehouses are inspected twice annually, and the proper cleansing enforced, the promised Amended Factory Bill will probably require the registration of Bakehouses. UNFIT FOOD. Markets and Market Streets were under the observation of your Inspectors daily, as well as on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings, and especially during the summer months.

Housing of the Working Classes Aft, 1890 (53 & 51 Vic., c. 70.) Part I. of this Act deals with unhealthy areas, Part II. with unhealthy dwellings and obstructive buildings singly, and Part III. with working class lodging-houses. A summary of the Act is contained in the Annual Report of the Chairman of your Health Committee. Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890 (53 & 54 Vic., c. 34). This Act provides for various measures in connection with the prevention of disease: amongst others, for the inspection of dairies and animals therein, and the prevention of the sale of infected milk; for expediting the disinfection of infected premises and their contents; for expediting the burial of persons dying from infectious diseases, for facilitating the deposition of the bodies in mortuaries, for preventing their removal from mortuaries and hospitals, and for disinfecting conveyances used for carrying infected corpses; for detaining in hospitals infected persons without proper lodging or accommodation to receive them on discharging themselves; for prohibiting infectious rubbish to be cast into ashpits without previous disinfection; and lastly, for providing temporary shelter for persons compelled to leave their dwellings during disinfection. Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890 (53 Vic., c. 8.) Section 26 (2) provides for the discharge of the assessment of inhabited house duty from artizan dwellings within certain limitations defined in the Act. But the definitions and limitations at present existing are difficult to comprehend, and require further elucidation and legislation to make them operative. VII.—APPENDIX.
