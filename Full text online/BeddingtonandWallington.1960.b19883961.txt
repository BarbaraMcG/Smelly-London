The report is drawn up in accordance with the suggestions made by the Minister of Health in his Circular 1/61. The vital statistics are based on information supplied by the Registrar-General. The report includes those services, which are under the control of the Surrey County Council, the Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946, under the heading of General provision of Health Services for the Area. These services are:â€” Nursing in the Home; Domestic Help Service; Chiropody; Care of Mothers and Young Children; Immunisation and Vaccination; Ambulance Facilities. The Registrar-General's estimate of the population of Beddington and Wallington at mid-year 1960 is 32,330, and this figure is used in the compilation of the vital statistics. The figure shows an increase of 80 compared with the Registrar-General's estimate for mid-year 1959. The census of population taken in 1951 was 32,751. The live birth rate per 1,000 total population shows a decrease at 13.54 in 1960, as compared with 14T6 in 1959. This rate is below that for England and Wales, which is 17.10. The stillbirth rate per 1,000 total births is 14.32, compared with 6.91 in 1959. This is lower than that for England and Wales, which is recorded as 19.80. The number of children stillborn in the district was 6, out of a total of 419 births, as compared with 3 in 1959 out of 434 births. The death rate from all causes per 1,000 total population is 10.95 compared with 9.92 in 1959 and 11.50 for England and Wales. Of the 365 deaths, diseases of the heart accounted for 123 (33.70 per cent of total deaths), cancer 74 (20.27 per cent of total deaths), and tuberculosis 3 (0.82 per cent of total deaths). It will be seen from the table on page 13, showing causes of death, that there were 123 deaths from heart disease, and that other diseases of the circulatory system accounted for 17 deaths, while vascular lesions of the nervous system (stroke) accounted for 58 deaths, making a total of 198 deaths. Most of these deaths took place in people past middle-age, which follows the usual pattern of mortality in this district. The 74 deaths from cancer were also in people of advancing years. Inflammatory chest diseases accounted for 45 deaths, as against 31 in 1959. This increase may be accounted for by the inclement weather during a considerable part of the year, with accompanying heavy rainfall. No deaths were recorded from motor vehicle accidents, compared with 3 in 1959. All other accidents accounted for 5 deaths, the same number as in 1959. Suicides totalled 2 cases, compared with 4 in 1959. 7 No mothers died in childbirth during 1960, and this gives a maternal mortality rate per 1,000 total births of nil, as compared with 0-39 for England and Wales. The infantile mortality rate shows a decrease at 16.95 per 1,000 live births, as compared with 18.56 in 1959. Seven infants died under the age of 1 year in 1960 out of 413 live births. On page 15 will be found an analysis of the causes of death. The corresponding rate for England and Wales is 21 -90. The incidence of infectious disease generally throughout the year, has been low, measles giving the highest figure with 149 notified cases. Scarlet fever, with 61 notified cases was next in order of incidence, but this was lower than the previous year. Twenty-four cases of whooping cough were notified. It is felt that the attention of parents should again be drawn to the need for immunisation against whooping cough. The immunising material used throughout the year against diphtheria, contained immunising material against whooping cough and tetanus. It is pleasing to record that during the year no cases of poliomyelitis occurred in the Borough. This is the second year in succession in which we have been able to make this comment. Poliomyelitis inoculation was well received during the year. Since the scheme began in 1956 9,948 persons had been given two injections, and 8,429 a third injection, by the end of the year under review. The Minister of Health has announced the introduction of a fourth poliomyelitis injection for children over five years of age and who have not yet attained the age of twelve years. The records in respect of this, however, belong to the year 1961. Comment has been made in the medical and national press concerning the introduction of a new vaccine to be taken by mouth. The Minister's Medical Officers are still investigating the possibility of introducing this type of vaccine, which has been used in large quantities in Russia and some other countries. Both vaccines, that is, the Sabine, which is taken by month, and the Salk, which is injected, have given a good measure of protection. It is possible, however, that in the presence of epidemics both types have a different role to play, it being felt that the oral vaccine might present a rapid method of immunising a population in the event of an epidemic. The Minister of Health, however, has made no specific announcement on the introduction of oral vaccines, and is awaiting further work by English Medical Officers, before committing the Ministry. It is generally agreed that the incidence of poliomyelitis has fallen since the immunisation scheme was commenced. In Surrey alone, it is pleasing to record a reduction in incidence, from 353 cases notified in 1955, (amongst these 9 deaths) to 17 cases in 1959, amongst whom only 2 deaths occurred. One cannot escape the conclusion that this striking fall in incidence, which has coincided with the introduction of the immunisation scheme, is a direct result therefrom. 8 For the twelfth year there were no cases of diphtheria notified. The immunisation against this disease continues to occupy a large place in the work of the department, both in children attending Infant Welfare Centres and Schools in the Borough. During the year the work of the department increased considerably with excursions into the field of social medicine. The care of the aged, with all the complications of geriatric services, kept the staff very well occupied. In addition, the Co-ordinating Conferences for the Prevention of the Break-up of Families were held regularly, and arising out of these, a considerable degree of social work, involving the Health Visitors, the County Council's Social Worker, and the Women's Voluntary Service, was undertaken. At these Conferences, the presence of a representative of the Corporation's Housing Department has been of the utmost value. Many of the problems arising at the Conferences were associated with housing, and it is sad to recall that so many years after the war, a great amount of unhappiness and hardship is still experienced through the inadequate housing of many families. In some cases, re-housing in New Towns has given young people a fresh start in life, free from "in-law" problems. Some cases have also been re-housed within the Borough, to enable children, for the first time, to enjoy the benefits of a garden and the society of their parents, without other interference. This new beginning, too, has enabled young married people to appreciate each other better, and has prevented, in some instances, a deterioration in the husband and wife relationship, with the threat of a family break up. It is also unfortunate to record that a few old people living alone, have shown a complete lack of a spirit of co-operation with those willing and anxious to help them. In the year under review two such cases were removed, under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, through a Magistrate's Order. The circumstances in which these poor old people had allowed themselves to drift, made such an action imperative. The fire at the Grange Mansion, which disrupted the whole of the County Council's clinic services, was commented upon in last year's report, and the new deployment of the services throughout the town was given prominence. During the year under review, plans for providing, under one roof, a unified comprehensive clinic, were discussed by the County Council, and also by the Borough Council. Agreement has been reached for the provision of a comprehensive new clinic adjacent to, and on the south side of the Town Hall, on a plot being acquired by the Beddington and Wallington Corporation, at the corner of Shotfield and Stanley Park Road. This area comprises approximately one acre, and gives ample opportunity for spacious clinic development. It is hoped that the architectural design will be in keeping with the Town Hall, and the new work being contemplated by the Corporation comprising an additional storey to the present Library building. The gardens will be re-designed, and it is hoped to achieve a pleasant vista from Stanley Park Road, looking down to the ornamental fish pond. 9 Various services, sewage disposal, collection of refuse, and the provision of an adequate and wholesome water supply are taken so much for granted to-day, that members of the general public are apt to overlook the care and thought which has to be given to maintain an adequate service in all these branches of hygiene and public health. An event of some importance took place during the year, when the Sutton District Water Company opened the new North Looe Reservoir, on Friday, 23rd September, 1960. As is well known, the Water Company obtains its water from deep wells sunk in the chalk at Sutton, Woodmansterne and Cheam. The water is softened and sterilized before being pumped to supply, and strict chemical and bacteriological control is maintained over all these supplies, which are supplemented at times of peak demand by a bulk supply by agreement with the Epsom Corporation. The new reservoir is constructed of reinforced concrete and has a capacity of 6,200,000 gallons with a top water level of 285 O.D. It is 283 ft. 6 in. long by 192 ft. wide, and when full contains a depth of water of 20 feet. The site is sufficiently large to permit the reservoir to be extended if required. It is a matter of considerable satisfaction to all the sanitary districts within the Sutton District Water Company's supply area, that this provision has been made, which should satisfy both industrial and domestic needs within the large residential population involved, for many years to come. In conclusion, I wish to place on record my appreciation of the loyal service and valuable assistance I have received from all the members of my staff throughout the year. 1 have the honour to be, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, PATRICK J. O'CONNELL, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Town Hall. Wallington. Telephone: Wallington 4500. July, 1961. 10 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (in acres) 3,048 Population, census, 1931 26,249 Population, census, 1951 32,751 Registrar-General's estimate of resident population for 1960 32,330 Number of inhabited houses, 1931 7,092 Number of inhabited houses, 1960 10,253 Rateable Value Â£733,998 Sum represented by penny rate Â£2,980 The Urban District of Beddington and Wallington was constituted in 1915 by an Order of the Surrey County Council, the area up to that time being part of the Croydon Rural District. By an Order in Council, dated 20th August, 1937, H.M. King George VI granted a charter to Beddington and Wallington, which was presented on the 15th September, 1937, by the Lord Lieutenant of the County of Surrey. The Borough is bounded on the east by the County Borough of Croydon, to the north by the Borough of Mitcham, to the west by the Carshalton Urban District, and to the south by the Urban District of Coulsdon and Purley. The Borough is practically fully developed, but the Council has preserved much of the open character of the area, by the extensive use of its powers in providing parks and open spaces. The area is mainly residential, but there are factories in the Borough, providing employment for some 9,000 people, these being situated mostly in the northern part of the Borough. During recent years there has been considerable residential development in the southern part of the Borough, with the provision of new roads of detached houses. All this development, in one of the best parts of the district, has been carried out on a policy of low density of houses to the acre, and the whole character of the scheme is in keeping with the accepted standards of the southern part of the Borough. Parks and open spaces continue to be well maintained, and give breathing space and facilities for open-air recreational activities. Beddington Park and Grange Park are used as much as ever, and are an inestimable boon during the holiday months to children and parents, who are unable to go away for a holiday. The pleasing residential character of the district is well maintained, and is much appreciated by many City workers, who return home to pleasant relaxation in their gardens and allotments in the evenings. 11 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS Resident Populationâ€”Estimated mid-year 1960 32,330 Live Births Males Females Total Legitimate 189 199 388 Illegitimate 9 16 25 Total 198 215 413 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 population 12.77 Adjusted Birth Rate 13.54 England and Wales Live Birth Rate 17.10 Illegitimate Live Births per cent of total Live Births 6.05 Still Births Legitimate 3 3 6 Illegitimate â€” â€” â€” Total 3 3 6 Rate per 1,000 total Live and Stillbirths 14-32 England and Wales Stillbirth Rate 19-80 Live and Stillbirths Legitimate 192 202 394 Illegitimate 9 16 25 Total 201 218 419 Deaths 189 176 365 (i) Death Rate per 1,000 population 11.29 Adjusted Death Rate 10.95 England and Wales Death Rate 11.50 (ii) Infant Deathsâ€”under 1 year of age Total No. of Deaths 7 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births 16.95 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births: Legitimate 18.04 Illegitimate Nil Infant Mortality Rate for England and Wales 21.90 Neo Natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births 12.11 (Under 4 weeks of age) Early Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births 9.69 (Deaths under 1 week) Peri-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live and Stillbirths 23.87 (Stillbirths and deaths under 1 week) (iii) Maternal Deaths (including abortion) total Nil Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live and Stillbirths Nil England and Wales Maternal Mortality Rate 0.39 12 REGISTERED CAUSES OF DEATH The following table, supplied by the Registrar-General, gives the causes of death of residents in the Borough during 1960: Causes of Death Males Females Total All Causes 189 176 365 1.

The maternal mortality rate for England and Wales per 1,000 live and still births was 0.39. INFANTILE MORTALITY The infantile mortality rate for 1960 was 16.95 per 1,000 live births. The comparable rate for England and Wales is 21.90. Great credit is due to the services operated in the Borough for the care of mothers and young children. Of the total of 413 live births, only 7 deaths of infants under one year of age (5 males and 2 females) were registered. 14 The following table gives the age and cause of death of each infant who died: Age Sex Cause of Death 3 mins.

NURSING IN THE HOME The Beddington and Wallington District Nurses' Home, 57 Montagu Gardens, administered by the Surrey County Council, continues to offer excellent facilities for nursing as in previous years, the day-to-day administration being in the hands of the Divisional Medical Officer for the Beddington and Wallington part of Mid-Eastern Division. During the year the District Nurses attended 812 cases, including 107 maternity and midwifery patients. A total of 22,805 visits was made. As pointed out in the preface, since the destruction of the Grange Mansion, the school health service has been housed in the Nurses Home, and in addition, physiotherapy, and ante-natal relaxation exercises are carried out on the premises. DOMESTIC HELP SERVICE This important branch of social service continued to meet a great need during the year, both for confinements and illness in the home. The service is administered by the Divisional Medical Officer at the Wallington Town Hall, and a part-time supervisor, who acts under the general direction of the Divisional Medical Officer, is employed. Close liaison was kept up with the almoners of hospitals, and it was found possible to meet the many requests received for Medical and Surgical patients and the care of the aged under the St. Helier Hospital geriatric service. The cases attended were as follows: Total Maternity 43 Chronic Sick (including aged and infirm)194 Acute Sick 40 Tuberculosis 277 CHIROPODY A chiropody service introduced in 1958 through the active co-operation of the W.V.S. and the British Red Cross, continued to operate in I960, as follows:â€” (1) The chiropodist attends one morning a week at British Red Cross House, in Woodcote Road, and for a small fee, old people can come and have their feet treated. (2) Arrangements are made through the Beddington and Wallington Fund for the Aged and Infirm, for a chiropodist to visit the homes of old people, who are unable to get out, and treatment is carried out in their own homes, at an agreed cost to the Fund. 16 (3) A member of the W.V.S. qualified in chiropody, occasionally gives treatment voluntarily, to home-bound and aged persons. The County Council, in February 1960, approved arrangements for the provision of chiropody for the elderly, and for expectant mothers and physically handicapped persons. The scheme came into operation in May, 1960. So far as the elderly are concerned, the County Council invited voluntary bodies administering schemes for chiropody treatment, to continue and expand their schemes, with financial help from the Council. The Divisional Medical Officer was asked to administer the scheme for expectant mothers and handicapped persons, through chiropodists practising in the area who had agreed to participate in the scheme. The chiropodist is paid a uniform fee of 7s. 6d. for each treatment undertaken in the surgery. The patient is required to contribute a standard fee of 3s. In approved cases the Divisional Medical Officer may authorise treatment free of charge. Negotiations were proceeding at the end of the year for an appropriate fee for domiciliary visits in necessitous cases. In the meantime a fee of 8/6d. is paid to a chiropodist for a domiciliary visit, where this is agreed, on medical grounds. THE CARE OF MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN Ante-Natal and Post-Natal Supervision. This clinic, as in previous years, continued to be held at the Nurses Home, 57 Montagu Gardens. During the year, 146 women made 541 pre-natal attendances. This represents an attendance of 34.84 per cent of the total number of confinements which occurred during 1960. Post-natal examinations were also conducted at this clinic, 14 patients making 16 attendances. As mentioned in previous reports, however, considerably more women have post-natal supervision than are recorded here. Those who have institutional confinements usually return to hospital as a routine a few weeks after their discharge, and have their post-natal examination conducted by the hospital Medical Officers. Institutional Confinements. Three hundred and eight or 73.51 per cent. of births allocated to this district, took place in hospitals and nursing homes, compared with 72.35 per cent recorded in the previous year. Patients going into hospital for a confinement are classified under two headings, those whose admission is essential on medical grounds and those who have unsatisfactory homes in which it would be inadvisable to conduct a domiciliary confinement. Every case is properly investigated, and it is only after a visit from the Health Visitor that patients requiring admission on social grounds are put forward for consideration by the hospital. 17 Treatment Centres and Clinics Child Welfare Centres When held Every Monday, 2.0-4.0 p.m. Hackbridge Centre, All Saints Church Hall, New Road.

During the year voluntary help was again generously given by many ladies in the district, in assisting in the operation of the infant welfare centres. Among these, special mention should be made of the members of the British Red Cross Society, who continued to supply the great majority of the voluntary help given. The ladies of the W.V.S. continued to organize the sales and distribution of the Welfare Foods, previously administered by the Ministry of National Insurance. Infant Welfare Services. Infant Welfare clinics and general supervisory control through health visiting were continued by the Surrey County Council during the year. In general, a high standard of visiting and a smooth and efficient service were maintained. Following the disastrous fire which destroyed the Grange Mansion in January 1960, it was found necessary to provide a new Infant Welfare Clinic at All Saints Church Hall, New Road, Mitcham Junction to serve the residents in the Hackbridge and Mitcham Junction areas. This clinic was opened on the 1st February, 1960. In addition, weekly sessions were commenced at the Baptist Church Hall, Queens Road, Wallington, on 13th January, to meet the increased demand from mothers in the area who had been attending the Grange Mansion clinic. 18 Later in the year, the fortnightly clinic held at the Beddington Village Hall, was transferred to The Scout Hall, Guy Road. It was agreed that a clinic on this site would provide facilities for a larger number of mothers and young children, and on the 7th December weekly sessions were commenced. The number of attendances recorded at the four clinics during the year was as follows:â€” Number attending Total attendances Children under 1 year 333 4,861 Children, 1-5 years 839 3,329 Total attendances 1,172 8,190 Health Visiting. Four health visitors are employed by the Surrey County Council for the supervision of infants up to 5 years of age and expectant and nursing mothers, both at home and at the infant welfare and ante-natal clinics. These health visitors are also responsible for the supervision of children attending schools in the Borough. During the year under review, difficulty was experienced in maintaining the establishment of four health visitors. Following the resignation of one health visitor, to take up a senior appointment, no candidates came forward for a period of four months in response to repeated advertisements. In addition, one health visitor had a long period of sickness. Visits during the year were made as follows: First visits Total visits Expectant Mothers 236 437 Children, 0-1 year 434 2,003 Children, 1-5 years â€” 3,743 Other Cases â€” 201 Ineffectual â€” 925 670 7,309 Child Life Protection. This function is now governed by the Children Act, 1948, which came into operation on the 5th July, 1948. A Children's Officer is appointed by the Surrey County Council to supervise all children coming within the provisions of the Act. The health visitors, however, visit on behalf of the Children's Officer deprived children under 5 years of age and certain other children in registered residential establishments. Care of Premature Infants. The arrangements made for the care of premature infants continued during 1960. Equipment is kept at the District Nurses' Home, the headquarters of the local Midwives, where it is ready for immediate use when required. Sixteen premature live births were notified during the year, 15 of which occurred in hospital. One infant died within 24 hours of birth. One infant died before the 28th day. The remaining 14 children survived. 19 Care of Illegitimate Children. The Surrey County Council make an annual grant to the Sutton and District Girls' Aid Association, whose visitor follows up cases occurring in the Borough. A grant is also made to homes for mothers and babies in Surrey where the unmarried mother can be admitted before the birth of her child, and cared for some months after birth. Ladies of the Women's Voluntary Services and the health visitors continue to co-operate in the alleviation of the lot of these unfortunate mothers. Treatment. Minor Ailments. Forty-seven cases were referred from the Infant Welfare Centres to Hospital Specialists for investigation and treatment during the year. The principal defects were as follows: Eye conditions 12 Tonsils and adenoids 15 Orthopaedic defects 8 NÃ¦vi and skin conditions 4 Circumcisions 2 Dental. The year's work at the Grange Dental Clinic, which provided for school children and children below the age of five years, as well as nursing and expectant mothers, is summarised in the following table: No. of Cases Extractions Fillings Scaling & Gum Treatment Provision of Dentures Full Partial Expectant and Nursing Mothers 5 5 7 6 - - Children, 0-5 43 51 77 â€” â€” â€” Totals 48 56 84 6 â€” â€” As has been pointed out elsewhere, this service is now accommodated at Rochester Road, Carshalton, and will continue on these premises until the County Council's new clinic project is ready. Orthopedic. Patients attending infant welfare centres who require treatment for orthopaedic defects are referred by the Clinic Medical Officer to orthopaedic surgeons at St. Helier or other hospitals. During 1960, 8 cases were referred for treatment. Physiotherapy. This department continues to do very useful work, and a high standard of attendance was maintained throughout the year. In addition to ultra-violet light and infra-red irradiation, massage, manipulation and corrective treatments are given. Classes for remedial exercises for children suffering from minor orthopaedic and postural defects were conducted during the year. The Physiotherapist continued to arrange classes for pregnant mothers desiring a course of relaxation exercises. 20 The following table gives details of attendances: Total attendances Irradiations Corrective treatments Children, 0-5 years 268 201 Children, 5-15 years 472 1,933 Expectant and Nursing Mothers 1 313 741 2,447 Immunisation and Vaccination This is one of the services transferred to the local Health Authority on 5th July, 1948. In Beddington and Wallington the work is conducted by the Divisional Medical Officer. In addition, general practitioners have been brought into the scheme and they forward returns of completed cases ofimmunisation to the Divisional Medical Officer, for which they receive a fee. Smallpox Vaccination. During 1960, 348 persons including 300 children under 5 years of age, were vaccinated and 58 persons were re-vaccinated, at the weekly clinic held at the Town Hall, or by their general practitioner. Diphtheria Immunisation. Four clinicsare heldweekly to give immunisation against diphtheria. These are held at each of the three Infant Welfare Centres and at the Medical Officer of Health's Department at the Town Hall. The following table gives the number of children residing in the Borough who were known to be immunised in both age groups. 0-5 years 5-15 years Total 0-15 years Approximate number of children in the Borough at 31st Dec., 1960 1,830 4,600 6,430 Number of children known to be immunised at 31st Dec., 1960 1,341 4,467 5,808 Percentage of children immunised 73.3 970 90.3 It is customary now to include immunisation against both whooping cough and tetanus in the injection given to immunise against diphtheria. Children immunised primarily against diphtheria, therefore, are automatically immunised against whooping cough and tetanus at the same time. Whooping Cough Immunisation. This service was continued throughout the year by the local health authority, to whom it was transferred on the 5th July, 1948. During the year, 395 children were immunised at County Council clinics or by their general practitioner. Tetanus Immunisation. Children are immunised against Tetanus at County Council clinics, or by their general practitioner. During 1960, 357 children completed a primary course and 19 children received a reinforcing dose. 21 Poliomyelitis The Poliomyelitis vaccination scheme, introduced in January 1956 continued, within the prescribed age groups, throughout 1960. The following is a summary of the persons who had been vaccinated by the end of the vear: Two Injections Three Injections Children born 1943â€”1960 6858 6472 Persons born 1920â€”1942 2620 1570 Expectant Mothers 410 355 General Practitioner and Ambulance Staff 60 32 9948 8429 An extension to the scheme for vaccination against poliomyelitis was made on 1st February, 1960, when the Minister of Health offered vaccination to persons up to their fortieth birthday. These persons are now included amongst the priority groups for whom the Local Health Authority may carry out vaccination. The response from the groups for whom poliomyelitis vaccination has been made available, has continued at a satisfactory level throughout the year. However, persons within the new age group up to forty years of age, have not come forward in such numbers as the Minister had hoped. It should be emphasized that, while poliomyelitis has generally been accepted as principally a disease of the young, statistics have shown in recent years, that many paralytic cases had occurred between the ages of twenty and forty. School Clinics With the coming into operation of the 1944 Education Act, the Medical Officer of Health was appointed in September, 1945, Divisional Medical Officer for the Beddington and Wallington half of the MidEastern Divisional Executive of the County of Surrey. School clinics were conducted at 57 Montagu Gardens Wallington, Rochester Road and Phoenix Flats, Carshalton. The services provided at these clinics were general medical inspection and treatment, dental treatment, speech therapy and physiotherapy. Cleansing of Persons During 1960 the Corporation continued to provide facilities for cleansing infested persons. LABORATORY FACILITIES The Corporation's arrangements for the examination of swabs, sputa and other pathological material continue as heretofore. During 1960, H. Amphlett Williams, Esq., Ph.D.(Lond.), A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., Public Analyst, City of London Laboratories, King's Head Yard, Borough High Street, London, S.E.I, continued the arrangement made in 1946 for the examination of milk, water and ice-cream. In general, pathological specimens, are sent to the Pathological Laboratories at St. Helier Hospital. Samples of milk and water are submitted for bacteriological examination to the Ministry of Health laboratories at Epsom, reports being received free of charge under the National Health Service Act, 1946. 22 HOSPITALS Infectious Cases. The South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board make provision for the admission and treatment of cases of infectious disease in hospitals under their control. Most of the cases from Beddington and Wallington continue to be admitted to the Wandle Valley Isolation Hospital. Smallpox. The Regional Hospital Board have made arrangements for the admission of cases of smallpox to their hospital at Joyce Green, Dartford. Venereal Diseases Clinics The Surrey County Council was, until the 5th July, 1948, responsible for the control and treatment of venereal diseases in the area, and was a member of the London and Home Counties Scheme. This service was taken over on the 5th July, 1948, by the Regional Hospital Board, who continue to provide free diagnosis and treatment at the Croydon General Hospital, at clinics established at St. Helier Hospital, the Royal Surrey Hospital, Guildford, the East Surrey Hospital, Redhill, and at hospitals previously under the London and Home Counties Scheme. General and Accident Cases. Cases from this area are admitted to: Carshalton, Beddington and Wallington District (War Memorial) Hospital. St. Helier Hospital, Carshalton. Croydon General Hospital. The Wilson Hospital, Mitcham. Maternity Cases. The Regional Hospital Board continue the provision at St. Helier Hospital for maternity cases in the Borough requiring institutional confinements. Some patients continue to be admitted to the Carshalton, Beddington and Wallington (War Memorial) Hospital under arrangements made by their practitioners under the National Health Service Act, 1946. AMBULANCE FACILITIES General and Accident Cases. Reorganisation of the ambulance services was undertaken by the Surrey County Council on their transfer on 5th July, 1948. The main ambulance station is situated at 163 Kingston Road, New Maiden, with a sub-station, covering the Beddington and Wallington area, located in Carshalton. DISINFECTION The disinfection of houses has been undertaken by the Council during the year and the Wandle Valley Hospital has continued to co-operate in the disinfection of bedding. Disinfection which is not absolutely essential in the interests of the public health is also undertaken upon a payment of Â£1 per load for bedding, etc., and 7s. 6d. for the first room and 3s. 9d. for each additional room as applied to house disinfection. 23 HOUSING I am indebted to the Town Clerk, the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, and the Chief Public Health Inspector for the following information, which is given in connection with rehousing, the erection of new houses, and overcrowding:â€” Rehousing Number of houses requisitioned since the beginning of the war and still held under requisition Nil Number of prefabricated bungalows provided since the end of the war 94 Number of families rehoused by the Council or by private owners at the Council's instigation since the beginning of the war 1185 Number of live applications on the housing list for accomodation in Beddington and Wallington:â€” On the general waiting list 353 On the aged persons' list220 For accommodation in Frimley and Camberley 32 New houses erected, etc. Number of new houses and flats erected in 1960:â€” Private enterprise 53 Local Authority Nil Number of flats erected by conversion in 1960:â€” Private enterprise 5 Local Authority 11 Number of houses and flats purchased in 1960 and let .. 23 Housing Act, 1957 Eighty nine houses were rendered fit as a result of informal or statutory action under the Public Health Act, 1936 and Housing Act, 1957. Number of inspections of dwelling-houses .. 223 Number of inspections recorded under Housing Regulations 18 In the absence of a complete survey of the Borough, it is impossible to give accurate figures relating to the number of cases of overcrowding. Evidence available indicates that the number is low. The table below sets out information concerning cases of overcrowding which have come to the knowledge of the Health Department. Number of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 5 Number of families dwelling therein 5 Number of persons dwelling therein 31 Number of new cases of overcrowding reported 2 Number of cases of overcrowding relieved 1 Number of persons concerned 4 Number of dwellinghouses in respect of which the Local Authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding and which have again become overcrowded Nil Rent Act 1957 Three applications for Certificates of Disrepair were received. Three notices of intention to issue Certificates of Disrepair were sent out. Two Certificates of Disrepair were issued. 24 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLIERS The water supply is piped throughout the district from the Sutton District Water Company. All dwelling-houses in the area are connected to public water mains. None of the inhabitants rely upon stand pipes. During the year the supply has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity. It is understood that the Water Company carry out routine bacteriological examinations of the raw and finished water daily from the wells at Sutton and Woodmansterne, and also of the treated water going into supply. Routine chemical examinations are also carried out. The raw water from the deep wells is of a relatively high degree of hardness. The company are under a statutory obligation (Sutton District Waterworks Act, 1903) to deliver water of not more than 9 degrees of hardness, and an elaborate softening plant is in use. During the year 93 samples of water were examined by the Public Analyst or the Public Health Laboratory Service. From the reports the water supply is shown to be satisfactory both in chemical and bacteriological purity, and no cases of illness associated with pollution of water supplies were recorded during the year. The chlorination of water from private wells situated in industrial premises was continued throughout the year. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE During the year the arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal continued to be adequate. The sewers have been systematically cleaned and flushed, and no major difficulties were experienced in the maintenance and cleansing of soil and storm water drainage systems, during the year. RIVERS AND STREAMS Normal cleansing of the River Wandle was carried out. CLOSET ACCOMMODATION Practically the whole of the area is on the water carriage system, draining into public sewers. There are a few chemical and earth closets, chiefly for use on sports grounds within the district, whilst four cesspools were in use in the district at the end of the year. PUBLIC CLEANSING During the year under review, the Borough Surveyor was able to continue refuse collection on a weekly basis. The collection of trade refuse was also continued as required. Cesspools and earth closets are dealt with by occupiers of the premises concerned, which continued arrangement is satisfactory. None of these premises are dwelling houses. 25 SANTARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA The following statement by the Chief Public Health Inspector gives statistics as to the number of complaints received, inspections made, defects remedied, and other work carried out by the Public Health Inspectors.

Sessions are arranged for the general public, school children, and youth organisations in the Borough. During the 1960 season, which covered a period of 18 weeks, the following attendances were recorded: Youth organisations 2,544 School children 5,784 Season Ticket Holders, etc.: Adults 20,646 Children 4,182 Total 33,156 The water supply for the Carew Manor School Swimming Bath is drawn from a well sunk in the grounds of the institution. After filling up, the water is only topped up, and complete emptying of the bath does not take place during the whole of the season. Chlorination is by means of a chlorine gas injector; the standard of chlorination maintained is 0.7 parts per million in the shallow end, and 0.4 parts per million in the middle of the bath. Filtration is carried out by pressure through a sand filter. Samples of the swimming bath water are submitted for bacteriological examination throughout the season. Those submitted in 1960 (10), were returned as bacteriologically sterile. 41 SCHOOLS School Closure. Infectious diseases common to childhood were not prevalent in epidemic form in any of the schools during the year. As a result it was not found necessary for any school to be closed by the local sanitary authority to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Medical Inspection. Under the 1944 Education Act the Assistant Medical Officers of the County Council continued to carry out routine and special medical inspections of schoolchildren in the maintained schools. This work is under the general supervision of the Medical Officer of Health, in his capacity of Divisional School Medical Officer for the Mid-Eastern Divisional Executive of the Surrey County Council. Water Supply and Sanitary Conditions. All the schools are supplied with water from the public mains and are connected with the sewers. During the year some progress was made in bringing the maintained schools up to pre-war standards of decoration. No major sanitary defects were found. Considerable thought has been given to the maintenance of good standards of hygiene in school canteens. The serving of meals on a large scale in establishments such as schools, represents a danger-point for the occurrence of food poisoning. The maintenance of high standards of hygiene and sanitation is dependent upon the intelligent co-operation of every individual member of a canteen staff. The Ministries of Health and Education are constantly devising methods of educating staff to realise the importance of a high standard of personal hygiene, in order to avoid outbreaks of food poisoning. In order to further the interests of hygiene, and encourage washing after the use of the toilet, all Infants' schools in the Mid-Eastern Division have now been provided with a constant hot water supply to the taps supplying the wash basins in the school cloak rooms. 42 OUTBREAKS OF FOOD POISONING, AND CLEAN FOOD CAMPAIGN No cases of food poisoning were notified during the year. NUTRITION The nutritional standards of school children, as observed at routine examinations, and children below school age, as observed at infant welfare centres, are maintained at a very high level, the general impression gained being that children tend to be taller and heavier in the respective age-groups than formerly. The Local Health Authority continued the scheme for the distribution of welfare foods since it was handed over by the Ministry of Food in June, 1954. Local issues are made from an office situated in the Corporation Car Park by the Divisional Medical Officer's staff and ladies of the W.V.S. Issues were also made at infant welfare centres and at the branch library in Beddington. Grateful thanks are due to the many volunteers, who so willingly co-operate in this important service for mothers and infants. Proprietary brands of vitamin preparations and some dried milk foods continue to be available to mothers at infant welfare centres and at the Town Hall. SHELL FISH (MOLLUSCAN) Only a small quantity of shell fish is marketed in the district, and is obtained chiefly from Billingsgate Market, London. 43 ADOPTIVE ACTS AND BYE-LAWS The following Acts have been adopted: Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1890, Parts I, II and III.
