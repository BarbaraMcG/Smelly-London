STPAN 18 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OP THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR THE YEAR 1861. TO THE VESTRY OF SAINT PANGEAS. Gentlemen, I have the honor to present to you my Sixth Annual Report, which contains an account of the vital statistics of your Parish, and the sanitary operations carried on during the year 1861. During the year 1861 the deaths in St. Pancras, exclusive of 121 in the Strand Union Workhouse, numbered 4579. The births numbered 6831 during the same period. If the population in the middle of the year be taken to be the same as was determined by the census in April, namely, 198,788, the death-rate is found to have been 2.3 per cent, or 230 per ten thousand. In London, as a whole, the death-rate was very nearly the same, about 2.317 per cent. It was lower than this in the other Northern Districts of the Metropolis, so also in the Western Districts, and the Southern Districts. The death-rate was higher in the Eastern Districts, about 24 per thousand, and higher still in the Central Districts, about 25 per thousand. These facts are exhibited in detail in Table A. As compared with preceding years, the death-rate in 1861 was higher than in 1860, about the same as in 1859, lower than in 1858, higher than in 1857, and about the same as the mean death-rate from 1848 to 1857. The different sub-districts of the Parish as usual exhibit considerable differences in their death-rates, the highest being 2.47 per cent. in Tottenham Court, and the lowest being 2.17 per cent. in Kentish Town—a difference of 2 30 deaths in every ten thousand of the population. The sub-districts, arranged in the order of their salubrity, stand as follows:—Kentish Town, Regent's Park, Camden Town, Gray's Inn Road, Somers Town, Tottenham Court Road. This is the same order which they took in 1860. Another way of estimating the relative healthfulness of districts is to consider the ratio which the births bear to the deaths under 5 years of age; by this method the districts of this Parish take nearly the same order as they do when judged by their gross death-rates, the only difference being that Somers Town changes places with Tottenham Court Road, having the highest infantile mortality in proportion to the numbers born. The relative infantile mortality of the several sub-districts stands in the same order as their relative density of population, Kentish Town being the least densely populated, and Somers Town the most densely, whilst Regent's Park stands second, Camden Town third, Gray's Inn Road fourth, and Tottenham Court Road fifth on the list. In Kentish Town there are only 27 persons to each acre; in Somers Town there are 212. The number of persons in each inhabited house varies from between 7 and 8 in Kentish Town to nearly 11 in Tottenham Court Road. The sub-districts, arranged according to the numbers of persons in each house, take the same order as when arranged according to their gross death-rate, except that Regent's Park and Camden Town change places. (Tables B and C.) It is thus seen that crowding exercises an important influence on the mortality of different parts of this Parish; this is quite in accordance with what is found to be the case in other places. Whatever exists to contaminate the air is of course much intensified by density of population, and diseases of an infectious nature are more readily spread in thickly populated localities. Hence the more urgent necessity in towns, especially in the more crowded portions of them, of the best possible drainage, of an abundant supply of good water, of well paved and frequently cleansed streets, of houses being so built that there may be a free current of air through them from top to bottom and from front to back. It is also very essential that the more crowded parts should be periodically inspected, to see that the house-drains are in efficient condition, that the house refuse is not allowed to accumulate in the cellars and close to the houses, that the water-butts are in good condition, and other sanitary matters are not neglected. The poor people who occupy these localities, although for the most part they welcome the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors or Medical Officer of Health, yet do not feel sufficient interest in the state of their homes to make spontaneous complaints, or do not like to do so from the fear of unpleasantness on the part of their landlords. Then again, when infectious diseases prevail in such districts, it is most important that they should be visited, in order that advice may be given as to the separation of the sick from the healthy, and as to the use of free ventilation, disinfecting materials, and other precautionary measures to prevent the spread of infection, and in the case of Small Pox to urge the importance of attention to vaccination. If this Parish could be sub-divided into still smaller sub-districts, and the mortality of these were calculated, the differences would be found to be much greater than those referred to above. For the purposes of the census, each sub-district was distributed into a number of enumeration districts, in all about 120. By the courtesy of the Registrar General, I have received the number of houses inhabited and uninhabited, and the numbers of persons, male and female, in cach of these sub-divisions. The average number of 3 inmates to a house in these sub-divisions varies from less than 6 to as many as 14. It would be very interesting to obtain the mortality in each enumeration district, and compare it with the population of each, as well as with what is known of the character of the population, as well as of the drainage and other sanitary provisions. The labour attending such an investigation would, however, be too great to allow of my undertaking it unassisted. The information thus obtained would be of very great value in directing sanitary improvements, and in indicating the conditions which operate most powerfully upon the health of different parts of the Parish. As I have not been able to calculate the death-rate in each of the enumeration districts, as above indicated, I have taken a few streets as specimens, and having ascertained from the General Census Office the population of these streets, I have extracted from the detailed tables of mortality, supplied to me weekly from Somerset House, the number of deaths that have occurred during the last six years in those streets, and from these data have calculated the death-rate. These particulars I have arranged in Table D. INFANT MORTALITY. Compared with the population at all ages, there were in the entire Parish in 1861, out of every ten thousand, 107 deaths under 5 years of age; at the census of 1851, the population under 5 years was about 12.5 per cent. of the gross population in St. Pancras. If the proportion of children to the entire population was about the same in 1861 as in 1851, the rate of mortality amongst children under 5 years of age was between 85 and 86 out of every thousand living at that age. Now, as there were, at the census, 49,844 families, it appears that, on an average, one family in every 24 lost one infant under the age of 5 years during the year 1861. The deaths under 1 year numbered 1065, and the number under that age, living in the Parish during the year, was about 6661.* It may be stated, that at that age the death-rate was over 16 per cent. per annum, about 7 times as as great as the rate at all ages combined. The rate of infantile mortality in some streets was much higher than this, as I have ascertained from the enumeration books of the late census, together with the tables of mortality, to both of which I have had access by the kindness of the Registrar General. Thus, in Ilenry Street, Hampstead Road, out of a population of 967, of whom 139 were children under 5 years of age, no less than 20 children died in 1861, and 21 in 1860 below that age—a rate of mortality equal to 21 per thousand of the whole population, and of 143 per thousand of those living at that age. In Tottenham Place, with a gross population of 754, and 84 children under 5 years of age, there were 8 deaths under 5 years of age in 1861, and 7 in 1860, giving a mean mortality of 10 per thousand of the whole, or 89 per thousand of those living at that age. In Southampton Court, of 24 children under 5 years of age, in 1860 2 died, and in 1861 5 died, giving a mean infantile mortality of 24 per thousand of the whole population, or 146 per thousand of those at that age, the rate of mortality in 1861 reaching as high as 208 per thousand of those living at that * The number of children living in the Pari-h under one year of age may be taken as the mean of the numbers born in 1860 and 1861. This estimate makes no allowance for tbe number of children brought into the Parish otherwise than by birth, or of those removed otherwise than by death. But these numbers would very slightly affect the total. 4 age. In Draper's Place the deaths of children under 5 years of age were in proportion to the numbers of all ages living there on the average of two years, as 16.1 to 1000. In Gresse Street they were as 12.6 to 1000, or about 1 in 80. In James Street, Wellington Square, there were 14 deaths under 5 years of age in the year 1861, out of a gross population of 294, or in the proportion of 47.6 to the thousand; the deaths under 5 years of age in this year amounted to 330 per thousand of the number living at that age. The number of deaths at all ages amounted to 16, which gives the enormously high death rate of 54 per thousand; the average annual death-rate in the six years, 1856-61, was 33 per thousand. In this street there are underground kitchens occupied as dwelling rooms imperfectly drained, owing to a sewer of insufficient depth; each room is occupied by a family, and in some of the houses the tops of the staircases are not supplied with the means of ventilation; the inhabitants are poor, and some of them intemperate. The evils existing here will be but very partially remedied by evacuating the cellars, and ventilating the staircases. The sewers might be deepened with great advantage to the health of the inhabitants. In Wellington Square, close to James Street, 'where there has been nearly as high a mortality, the same evils exist; both the paving and draining of this square call for improvement. The infant mortality in Wellington Square in 1860 was 34 per cent of the number living at that age; in 1861 it fell to 6½ per cent. Poplar Place is another place exhibiting a high rate of mortality—34 in the thousand as the average annual rate in six years. This is a place occupied by the Irish, whose habits are dirty, and their mode of living most irregular. The houses are built with privies under the staircases, and the effluvia from them pervades the dwelling. This Place and Compton Place might very advantageously be pulled down, and a very good site could thus be obtained for the erection of dwellings on an improved model; the existing houses are much dilapidated, and the sanitary arrangements are, from the very construction of the houses, most defective. It has been estimated that the amount of sickness prevalent in a place bears a tolerably constant proportion to the mortality.* The law of the proportion is found to be "that the numbers constantly suffering from acute sickness at any year of age (from 15 years and upwards) will amount to double the number of yearly deaths, and the number of invalids or permanent sufferers from past sickness will be equal to the number of annual deaths." Consequently, as the deaths in St. Pancras during 1861, at the age of 15 years and upwards, numbered 2227, we may conclude that there were, on an average, constantly on the sick list, unable to work, dependent on past savings, or on the assistance of friends, or compelled to throw themselves on the Parish, 6681 adult persons, of whom one-third were permanently disabled, so that they will never again be able to work for their maintenance. The adult population, that is, the population above 15 years of age, was, in 1851, about 68 per cent. of the whole; if the same proportion existed in 1861, the number living above 15 years of age at the census would be 135,176, so that we should have one person out of every 20 constantly sick, and of these, one-third, or one of every 60 persons in the population, permanently disabled. A large proportion of these was amongst the poor, many of whom were thus brought on to the rates, for there is no cause of pauperism so prolific as sickness. The numbers above bear no reference to the sickness of children, but it must * "On the Statistics of Health," by T. R. Edmonds, Esq., B A , Appendix to Report of the Proceedings of the Fourth Session of the International Statistical Congress, page 450. 5 be borne in mind that very much of the permanent disability occurring in adult life, and the liability to diseases which interrupt the work of adults, is dependent on the sickness of childhood. Every sickness of an adult is a money loss, representing either an increased burthen on a family, or a tax upon the purse of the ratepayers. It has been estimated by Dr. Farr, that the average period of acute sickness is about 36 days, so that the loss is equivalent to about one-tenth part of the year's work. Now seeing that about 1 in 30 of the community was constantly suffering last year from acute sickness, and each one on the average was ill about 36 days, it follows that to every 3 adults there was, on the average, one attack of acute sickness during the year. By sanitary measures, we have good reason to expect that the mortality may be reduced in St. Pancras from 4579, or 23 per thousand, to 3379, or 17 per thousand—a reduction of 1200 lives in one year. The amount of prevalent sickness would probably be still more reduced, because not only would the number of attacks be much reduced, but the duration of the attacks, which ended in recovery, would be much shortened; for nothing retards and protracts the period of convalescence so much as impure air. The causes of death are given in detail in Table I. The causes there given are ranged under upwards of a hundred heads, and distributed according to the ages in the manner adopted by the Registrar General in his Reports. The deaths may be arranged as follows, into larger classes:— I. Zymotic Diseases. 1 Miasmatic 986 2 Enthetic (Syphilis, &c.) 46 3 Dietic (Privation or Excess) 29 4 Parasitic (Thrush, &c.) 10 II. Constitutional Diseases. 1 Diathetic (Gout, Cancer, &c.) 136 2 Tubercular and Rickety 826 III. Local Diseases. 1 Diseases of the Nervous System 589 2 Diseases of the Vascular System 177 3 Diseases of the Respiratory Organs 793 4 Diseases of the Digestive Organs 190 5 Diseases of the Urinary Organs 68 6 Diseases of the Organs of Generation 11 7 Diseases of the Organs of Locomotion 12 8 Diseases of the Skin and Integument 20 6 IV. Development Diseases. 1 Congenital Malformations and Developmental Diseases of Children 142 2 Developmental Diseases of Adults 11 3 Developmental Diseases of Old Age 249 4 Diseases of Nutrition 189 V. Violent Deaths. 1 Accidental or from Negligence 120 2 Homicide 9 3 Suicide 23 VI. Causes not specified 43 The Miasmatic diseases, including Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diarrhoea, and the diseases commonly called Epidemic, are very much under the influence of sanitary measures, so that their prevalence is commonly taken as an evidence of defective sanitary arrangements. Last year their number was 986, whilst in 1860 it was only 660, and in 1859 it was 1084, and in 1858 the number was 1168. Of these diseases in 1861, Hooping Cough was most fatal, causing 269 deaths; Scarlatina came next with 201 deaths; then Diarrhoea and Cholera with 140 deaths, Typhus with 95, Measles with 114 deaths, Diphtheria 51, and Croup 27, besides 20 from Laryngitis. From Small Pox the number of deaths was only 7, a lower mortality than has prevailed any year since my appointment in 1856. It is to be hoped that the absence of deaths from this disease will not encourage a neglect of vaccination, because so certainly as this is the case will another epidemic of Small Pox break out within a few years, and cut off large numbers of those who are unprotected, owing to the negligence or obstinacy of their parents or guardians. There is reason to fear that many children born last year were not vaccinated, judging from the Returns of the Public Vaccinations for the year ending 29th September, 1861. Out of 6865 registered births, there were successfully vaccinated by the Parochial Vaccinators only 3082. Now if we suppose that 2800 children were either vaccinated by other vaccinators, or died under the age of three mouths, there is still a large number of children, about 1000, whose vaccination has been neglected. This is really a serious matter. Typhus Fever was very extensively prevalent in many parts of London during 1861, so that the London Fever Hospital was usually very full all the year. It is gratifying to find that there were only about 30 patients who required to be sent from St. Pancras to that Hospital during the year, at an expense of £32. 4s. In 1856 the cost of patients sent there amounted to nearly £300. Puerperal Fever, or the fever which attacks women in childbirth, has been more fatal than usual, 18 deaths having been due to this cause, besides 11 other deaths due to other complications of childbirth. From Scrofula, Tubercle, and Rickets (diseases frequently engendered by living in impure air, at other times inherited or brought on by want of proper and sufficient nourishment), the deaths were 826, whilst in 1860 they were 740. 7 Diseases of the Nervous System were fatal in 589 cases in 1861, only 486 cases in 1860; diseases of the Organs of Circulation and Respiration were much less fatal in 1861 than in 1860. Delirium Tremens and Intemperance are given as the causes of 7 deaths, but this number falls far short of what would represent the victims to excess of alcohol; a vast number of diseases of the stomach, liver, and kidneys being due to this cause as well as many cases of Dropsy; and many of the violent deaths may also be traced to intemperance. Syphilis appears as the cause of 37 deaths, but it is really much more active than would be represented by that number, a vast number of deaths from Premature Birth, Atrophy, Convulsions, and Skin Affections being really due to the venereal poison. In no case does it appear more obviously that " the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children, even to the third and fourth generation." Under the head of Violent Deaths we have 152 cases, of which 120 were from accident or gross negligence, 9 homicidal, and 23 suicidal. On the railways, 20 of these deaths occured. The collision on the North London Railway in Kentish Town, by which so many lives were lost, took place during 1861. From scaffold accidents, 7 were killed; by conveyances on the ordinary roads, 11 were killed; 23 were either burnt or scalded to death, of which 19 were children under 10 years of age; 14 were drowned, 6 probably by accident, and 8 suicidally. Under the head of suffocation are included 17 deaths, of which 13 were children under twelve months of age, who were smothered by carlessness in bed, or else intentionally murdered, as there is reason to fear in some of the instances. Eight committed suicide by hanging, 2 by pistols or gun-shot, 2 by cutting instruments, and 3 by poison—prussic acid, arsenic, and a preparation of mercury having been the several poisons used. Under the head of accidental poisoning are 5 deaths, one of which was that of a young woman aged 19, who died from the effects of arsenic taken into her stomach, or in other ways into her system, whilst making artificial flowers. She died with all the symptoms caused by arsenic, great irritation of the stomach and bowels, with extreme nervous debility and prostration. After death, manifest indications were obtained of the presence of arsenic in the tissues of the body, and the ordinary signs of poisoning by that mineral were also observed. This young person was employed at a factory in Judd Street, where from 60 to 70 persons are engaged in the manufacture of artificial flowers and leaves. Many of those employed suffer very much in health from their exposure to the dust of the arsenic which they inhale, and take into their system by its getting under their nails, on their eyes, or on raw surfaces. The process which is most injurious, and ought certainly to be prohibited, is what is called "fluffing;" it consists in dipping the leaves into warm wax, and then powdering, from a kind of dredging box, the green colouring matter on to the leaf. In this process a quantity of the fine dust of the powder is diffused in the air, and portions of it cannot fail to be drawn into the lungs during inspiration, and some of it to come in contact with the eyes, lips, and nostrils, where it is readily absorbed into the blood. Some of the workwomen wear over their mouths and noses a cloth to prevent the entrance of the dust; many of them neglect this precaution, and even where it is adopted, the measure is a very imperfect one as a means of protection. This is said to be the second death which has been clearly traced to the same cause within 6 or 8 months, besides the instances where death ensues, there are a vast number of other persons, whose health is 8 radically undermined, and their lives rendered miserable. Mr. Paul, Surgeon in Burton Crescent, informs me that he frequently sees patients suffering from all the symptoms of slow arsenical poisoning, clearly induced by their working with this colouring matter. The substance employed is known as Scheele's Green, it is a compound of arsenious acid and copper, and is as poisonous as arsenic itself. It gives a peculiar bright emerald green, very brilliant, but not at all like the beautiful green of natural leaves. There are several other substances which may be used to give a green colour, which are quite harmless, and the natural green may be better imitated by some of these substances, than by arsenious compounds. It is to be hoped that ladies when buying green ornaments, and all persons when choosing green papers for their rooms, or coloured confectionary for their children, will take the trouble to ascertain whether there is arsenic or any other poison used as the colouring ingredient. The manufacture of colours for ornamental purposes seems to call loudly for some legislative regulation. Representations have been made to the Home Secretary on the subject, but I am not aware that any steps are being taken by the Government in reference to the matter. Under the age of 5 years, 2108 deaths occurred, which is 46 per cent. of the gross mortality; between 5 and 10 years, 168 deaths, or between 3 and 4 per cent. of the mortality at all ages; at 10 and under 15 years, 76 deaths occurred, less than 2 per cent. of the whole; in the following ten years, 15 and under 25, 181, nearly 4 per cent.; in the next ten years, 272, about 6 per cent.; at 35 and under 45 years, 326, about 7 per cent.; at 45 and under 55, 327 deaths; at 55 and under 65, 397 deaths, a little more than 8 per cent. of the mortality at all ages; at 65 and under 75, 368 deaths; at 75 and under 85, 294 deaths; at 85 and under 95, 48 deaths; at 95 years and above, 7 deaths. WORKHOUSE. In this building there were 472 deaths in 1861, a mortality considerably higher than the average of 5 preceding years. There were 13 deaths from Scarlatina, 14 from Hooping Cough, 1 from Measles, and 1 from Low Fever, MEWS. I have again tabulated, as in former years, the deaths that have occurred in these places. The deaths in 1861 amounted to 61, which gives a rate of mortality a little more than 20 in the thousand. In the Mews of the Somers Town and Gray's Inn sub-districts, the rate of mortality was higher than in the others; in the former it was 34 per thousand, and in Gray's Inn 23 per thousand. From Zymotic diseases there were 14 deaths; Diphtheria, 4; Scarlet Fever, 3; Typhus, 1; Croup, 2; Hooping Cough, 1; Diarrhoea, 1; and Rheumatic Fever, 1. From Bronchitis and Pneumonia, 16 deaths; from the Nervous diseases of childhood, 10 deaths; from Tubercular disease, 4 died; and from Atrophy, or debility from birth, 5. Two committed suicide, and 3 children died from accidental causes. Under the age of 5 years there were 43 deaths. When I first examined the mortality in Mews, I was led to believe that the death-rate was higher in them, than in other parts of the Parish occupied by people of the same station in life. Having extended my observations over 6 years, and having obtained a correct census of the population, I find that the 9 death-rate is not so high on an average of 6 years, as in some other parts, in such places for instance as Henry Street, Mary Street, Draper's Place, Midford Place, Tottenham Place, Poplar Place, James Street, and Wellington Square. The crowding together of many families in one house operates most prejudicially in raising the death-rate; the air is more contaminated by a number of human beings herding together, than by a few horses. There are a few houses in this Parish occupied by as many as 50 persons, aud a great many occupied by 25 or 30, and as most of the air passes up from the street door into the dwelling rooms on the basement, and from them into the staircase, and thence into the rooms above, and so on upwards till it reaches the top story, it can easily be understood how much it has lost of its oxygen or life-giving portion, and how much it has become charged with carbonic acid and other products of decomposition which are death giving or disease-breeding ingredients, before it reaches the roof. At this point it is frequently stagnant, and as there is no window which will open, or any skylight or opening in the roof, there is no means of its being renewed near the top of the stairs. To diminish the evils attendant on this state of things, free openings on the staircases and in the roof are required, as well as windows in the dwelling-rooms which open from the top as well as at the bottom. Wherever these can be provided, it is my endeavour to get them introduced by representation to the landlord of the necessity for such provisions. In many cases the houses are built back to back, or there is some opposition raised by the occupants of houses in the rear to any opening being made which will overlook their back windows. Sometimes landlords are ready to receive and act upon any reasonable suggestions; in other cases they will only do what the law empowers the Sanitary Committee to enforce, which is necessarily much less than is desirable for the health of the inmates—the Nuisances Removal Act, under which most of our proceedings are taken, being only designed to abate very glaring evils, and even to accomplish this design, being in many points extremely ineffectual. By looking at Table II.—VI. inclusive, it will be seen, that in the 1st quarter of the year the deaths numbered 1490; in the 2nd quarter, 1105; in the 3rd quarter, 1034; and in the 4th quarter, 1072. The 1st quarter is usually the quarter of highest mortality, but in 1860 this quarter was unduly unhealthy as compared with other years. METEOROLOGY. The mean temperature was 49°.4, which is 1°.1 above the mean in 90 previous years, and 2°.4 above the temperature of 1860. The 1st quarter averaged 39°.9, being l°.8 above the average of corresponding quarters; the 2nd quarter averaged 5l°.8, which is 0°.4 below the average; the 3rd quarter had a mean temperature of 60°.4, which is 0°.9 above the average; and the 4th quarter had a temperature of 45°.5, which is 2°.0 above the mean in corresponding quarters of previous years. The mean daily range of temperature was 16°.5, which was 0°.7 more than usual. The mean height of the barometer was 29.798, which is 0.023 of an inch lower than usual. Rain fell to the depth of 20.7 inches, which is 4.9 less than usual, and 11.3 inches less than in 1860. 10 SANITARY WORKS. The following measures have been carried out under the immediate supervision of myself and the Sanitary Inspectors:— New drainage has been supplied to 163 houses. New traps have been applied to 618 drains. The drainage of 123 other houses has been improved. In 198 cases cesspools have been emptied, filled in, and trapped water closets provided. New pans, traps, and water supply have been furnished to 220 closets, 24 new water closets have been erected. 30 new dust bins have been put up. 32 dust bins have been repaired. The yards or cellars of 50 houses have been paved. Water supply has been furnished to 26 houses. 91 houses have been cleansed and lime-washed. In 5 houses overcrowding has been abated. 43 lots of pigs have been removed. 23 cow sheds have been improved. To effect these improvements, 458 primary and 34 final notices have been issued. In 27 instances the notices were ineffectual, and summonses were taken out and heard before the Police Magistrates, in almost every case with satisfactory results. The only cases in which difficulty occurred were those in which the ownership was disputed. The complaints entered on the books of the Sanitary Department numbered 704. The slaughter-houses and cow-sheds have been periodically visited, 540 visits having been paid to cow-sheds, and 508 to slaughter-houses. The sausage shops, tripe-boiling, fish-frying shops, as well as cat's meat shops, and the markets in Somers Town, Camden Town, and Hampstead Road, have been regularly visited. There have been seized, and condemned as unfit for human food, large quantities offish, including 31 pads of mackerel, 4 pads of soles, 65 lobsters, 54 crabs, 15 pads of plaice, and 15 tubs of herrings; also 340 fowls, rabbits in very large numbers, grouse and geese, and 6 joints of meat; also a quantity of rotten plums, peaches, and oranges. Owing to the vigilance of- the Inspectors, a much smaller quantity of unwholesome meat, fish, and poultry is exposed for sale now, than in former times before the Act was brought into operation. Much more good is done in this way by prevention, than can be at all estimated by the amount actually seized. There are many streets in the Parish where there are open cesspools to all 11 the houses which cannot be abolished, owing to the absence of sewers within a hundred feet of the houses, Little or nothing has been done in this Parish in regard to the sewerage of streets built before the Metropolis Local Management Act was passed. It is very much to be desired, that now the Amendment Act is passed, which, it may be presumed, sets at rest the question as to the manner in which the expenses of such new sewerage are to be met, some measures will be at once adopted to provide proper drainage for those parts of the Parish which are at present destitute of it. The Main Drainage, which is now so nearly completed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, so far as it affects this district, will be of little service to the Parish unless the sewers, which enter into these main intercepting channels, be well constructed, and all parts in which there are streets or houses, be provided with sewerage. Many neighbouring parishes have been busy in making new sewerage, and the benefits will be shortly seen in a diminished death-rate, and in a reduction of sickness. Such has invariably been the result in towns where efficient drainage has been carried out. St. Pancras has many natural advantages, and should have as low a death-rate as any part of London; there are, however, at present many districts, whose mortality is lower. Should it not be your ambition, Gentlemen, who are entrusted with the management of so large and important a district, to render that district as salubrious as possible, so that persons in coming to London to seek for a healthy residence, will be referred to St. Pancras as affording one of the most healthy and desirable. The value of property is always affected, and will, I am convinced every year with the extension of knowledge, be more and more so, by the death-rate which prevails in a locality; and thus proprietors will be directly benefited, and the rates will bring larger returns to the parochial exchequer, in proportion as sanitary measures are carried out.
