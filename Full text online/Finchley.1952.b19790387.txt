I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1952. The vital statistics are highly satisfactory. The birth rate (13.6) has increased, the death rate (11.1) has decreased. The infantile mortality rate (11.5) is extremely low and there was only one death in children of 1-5 years. The maternal mortality is nil. A Finchley resident contracted and succumbed to Poliomyelitis outside the Borough, but otherwise there was no death from the common infectious diseases. It is now 7 years since we had a case of Diphtheria. The position regarding Tuberculosis shows very little change. The record of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors is set out in some detail. Much time has been devoted to such matters as the improvement of housing conditions, safeguarding food supplies, education in food hygiene, destruction of pests and vermin, and the betterment of sanitary conditions in general and no small measure of success has been achieved. I tender my thanks to all the staff of the Health Department for willing and efficient work throughout the year and particularly to Mr. Gray and Mr. Legge for their help in preparing this report. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. A. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,478 Population, 1952 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 70,290 Number of Inhabited Houses (1952; 19,812 Rateable Value (1952) £930,016 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £3,822 Total Live Births 953 Birth Rate per 1,000 home population 13.6 Birth Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 15.3 Total Stillbirths 23 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 23.6 Total Deaths 782 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 home population 11.1 Standardised Death Rate 10.2 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 11.3 Infant Deaths 11 Infant Mortality Rate 11.5 Infant Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 27.6 Maternal Deaths - Maternal Mortality Rate — Maternal Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 0.72 Live Births Males Females Total Legitimate 476 435 911 Illegitimate 24 18 42 500 453 953 Birth rate 13.6 per 1,000 estimated home population.

The rate for England and Wales was 15.3. Stillbirths There were 23 stillbirths, and all of them took place in hospital. The stillbirth rate for the Borough was 0.33 per 1,000 of the home population, and for England and Wales it was 0.35. Infantile Mortality There were only eleven deaths of infants under one year of age giving an infantile mortality rate of 11.5 per 1,000 live births. This is by far the lowest rate ever recorded and I am of the opinion that this record will stand for a good many years as the scope for further reduction has now become very limited indeed. The corresponding rate for England and Wales was 27.6. 6 Maternal Mortality There were no maternal deaths in 1952. Deaths There were 782 deaths in 1952—95 less than 1951. A comparable drop took place over the whole country. The standardised death rate was 10.2, and the death rate for England and Wales was 11.3. The decrease in the mortality rate in Finchley was largely accounted for by a decline in the number of deaths from diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Influenza, Nephritis and accidents. There were 32 fewer deaths in the age group 65-75 years and 59 less in ages over 75. Out of the total of 782 deaths 530 were of persons over 65 years of age. Mortuary One hundred and twenty-five bodies were received in the Mortuary, and 25 of these were from Friern Barnet. Post-mortem examinations were carried out in all cases 8 INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1952 Deaths from stated causes at various ages under one year of age CAUSE OF DEATH Under 1 week 1-2 weeks 2-3 weeks 3-4 weeks Total under 4 weeks 4 weeks and under 3 months 3-6 months 6-9 months 9-12 months TOTAL All Causes Certified 9 - - - 9 - 1 1 1 1 Uncertified - - - - - Smallpox - - - - - - - - - - hicken Pox - - - - - - - - - - Measles - - - - - - - - - - Scarlet Fever - - - - - - - - - - Whooping Cough - - - - - - - - - - Diphtheria & Croup - - - - - - - - - - Erysipelas - - - - - - - - - - Tuberculous Meningitis - - - - - - - - - - Meningitis (not Tuberculous) - - - - - - - - - - Convulsions - - - - - - - - - - Laryngitis - - - - - - - - - - Bronchitis - - - - - - - - - - Pneumonia (all forms) - - - - - - - - - - Diarrhoea - - - - - - - - - - Enteritis - - - - - - - - - - Gastritis - - - - - - - - - - Syphilis - - - - - - - - - - Rickets - - - - - - - - - - Suffocation, Overlying - - - - - - 1 - - 1 Injury at Birth - - - - 1 - - - - 1 Atelectasis 1 - - - 1 - - - - 1 Congenital Malformations 3 - - - 3 - - - 3 Premature Birth 3 - - - 3 - - - - 3 Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus - - - - - - - - - - Other Causes 1 - - - 1 - - 1 - 2 TOTALS 9 - - - 9 - 1 1 - 11 10 causes of, and ages at death during the year, 1952 No. CAUSES OF DEATH NET DEATHS AT THE SUBJOINED AGES OF "RESIDENTS" WHETHER OCCURRING WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE DISTRICT All Causes - Certified All Ages Under 4 months 4 months and under 1 year 1 and under 5 5 and under 15 15 and under 25 25 and under 45 45 and under 65 65 and under 75 75 and upwards Uncertified 1.

There is no doubt that this is due to immunisation and once again I stress the duty of all parents to ensure that their children are immunised not only in their own interests but in the interest of the whole community as it is only by having a high proportion of the child population immunised that the disease can be kept at bay. During the year 688 children were immunised by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority and in 325 of these a combined Diphtheria prophylactic and Whooping Cough vaccine was used. Seven hundred and twenty-eight children were given "booster" doses of diphtheria prophylactic at the age of 5 years. Scarlet Fever There were 93 cases of Scarlet Fever, 6 fewer than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is 16 little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis There were 3 cases of poliomyelitis all of which were paralytic. The death of a young man who died outside the district was allocated to Finchley. Measles There was a decrease in the number of notifications, there being 577, compared with 647 in 1951. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough Whooping Cough continued to be prevalent as in 1950 and 1951. The notifications numbered 273 in 1952, and there were no deaths. During the year, 289 children were immunised by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. Pneumonia Forty-eight cases were notified in 1952 and there were 31 deaths, 20 of which were persons of 65 years of age and over. Malaria One case of malaria in a soldier who had served abroad was notified. Puerperal Pyrexia The total number of cases notified during the year was 44. Forty-three cases occurred at the North Middlesex Hospital Annexe in The Bishop's Avenue and the remaining one, at home. Miscellaneous The following cases were also notified: Dysentery 17 Erysipelas 6 Paratyphoid B 1 19 Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory Colindale, during 1952.

There were no deaths from non-pulmonary tuberculosis as compared with 3 in the previous year. 20 The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years: Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F M F M F 1943 41 39 7 5 14 11 3 5 1944 48 30 8 8 14 9 3 2 1945 49 41 8 1 17 9 5 1 1946 43 26 2 8 14 9 1 2. 1947 54 36 1 4 18 9 2 -- 1948 37 26 4 5 5 7 3 2 1949 41 37 2 4 10 8 1 4 1950 37 21 2 7 9 5 2 — 1951 37 30 2 6 6 10 1 2 1952 43 21 4 6 15 2 - - Medical Examinations Twenty-two persons were examined on appointment to the Council's staff and 20 workmen were examined with a view to their admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47 Several cases were brought to the notice of the Department of persons who were living in insanitary surroundings and who were not receiving proper care and attention. In each case it was possible to make satisfactory arrangements for these persons without having to resort to compulsory removal to suitable premises under the provisions of the above section. (b) Section 50 Two burials were carried out by the Council under the provisions of this section. 23 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are particulars of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors during the year 1952 : Housing Statistics 1. Inspection of Dwelling-houses: (1) (a) Total number of dwelling-houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 1,398 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 5,765 (2) (a) Number of dwelling-houses (included under sub-head (1) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 — (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose— (3) Number of dwelling-houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation — (4) Number of dwelling-houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 673 2. Remedy of defects during the year without service of formal notices: Number of defective dwelling-houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their officers 601 3. Action under Statutory Powers during the year: A. Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1936: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs 9 (2) Number of dwelling-houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices: (a) By owners 6 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners 2 24 B. Proceedings under Public Health Acts: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 25 (2) Number rendered fit: (a) By owners 27 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners 4 C. Proceedings under Sections 11 and 13 of the Housing Act, 1936: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made — (2) Number of dwelling-houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders 1 Houses Unfit for Human Habitation 1188, High Road, N.20. A demolition order which was served upon the owner in 1951 was complied with and the house demolished in the early part of the year, the tenants being re-housed by the Council. Elmshurst Cottage, East End Road, N.2. The above house was demolished by the Council and the tenants re-housed. 5 Plowmans Cottages, Chapel Street, N.2 This house, which is one of a pair, was found during 1951 to be unfit and incapable of repair at reasonable cost. The tenants were re-housed by the Council and, as the premises are within the East Finchley Re-development area, demolition has been deferred until the adjoining property is dealt with, the windows and doors being boarded up and the premises made reasonably secure by the owner. Farm House, Ken Wood, Hampstead Lane, N.W.3. A scheme for reconditioning the derelict portion of this old octagonal farm building was carried out by the London County Council, the premises being modernised internally whilst preserving the character of the old building. Accommodation was provided for two families in separate dwellings. 25 Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 16,634. At 706 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 2,178 were discovered, and at the end of the year 2,555 including a number outstanding at the end of 1951 had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 276 was in hand and 1,230 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied 1,607 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. I must again draw attention to the difficulty which owners of rent controlled property are having in meeting the present day costs of repairs, resulting in a large number of cases in the deterioration of the houses. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out: Inspections under Housing Acts 10 Special Inspections 3,752 Reinspections 2,993 Inspections of Works in Progress 1,607 Inspections of Factories and Workplaces (including Bake houses and Restaurant Kitchens) 450 Visits to Slaughterhouses 1 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 23 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 99 Inspections of Meat, Fish ana other Food Shops 669 Inspections of Shops (Shops Act) 119 Visits re Infectious Disease and Vermin 781 Visits re Rodent Control 5,322 Visits re Housing Act, 1936 247 Visits re Building Licences 5 Visits re Hawkers 76 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 26 Visits to Houses Let in Lodgings 6 Visits re Pet Animals Act, 1951 9 Miscellaneous 439 16,634 26 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Repairs or amendments to existing drains 46 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 26.5 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 586 Length in yards of iron drains laid 10 Manholes provided 33 Manholes repaired 7 Manhole covers provided 40 Intercepting traps fixed 1 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 7 New gully traps fixed 75 Gully curbs provided or repaired 11 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 3 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 12 Water tests applied 201 Smoke tests applied 21 Air tests applied 14 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C.

The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. Disinfection and Disinfestation Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 139 Number of articles disinfected 2,567 Number of verminous premises dealt with 22 Verminous rooms disinfested 50 Seven hundred and eighty-one visits were made by inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required. There was a slight decrease in the number of premises infested with bugs, 14 cases having been dealt with, compared with 15 in 1951. The following is a summary of disinfestation work carried out during the year: Premises Bugs 14 Fleas 1 Cockroaches 4 Beetles 3 Ants 7 Wasps 81 Miscellaneous 6 The number of verminous rooms which were dealt with was 50 compared with 62 in 1951. Houses Let in Lodgings During the year no addition was made to the Register of Houses Let in Lodgings. The number of registered premises in the Borough is 78. 29 Sanitary Conveniences There are 24 conveniences attached to public houses within the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. A new public convenience for both sexes was opened on the Glebe Land, North Circular Road, during 1952. There are now 14 public conveniences in the Borough, including those in recreation grounds. Thirteen of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and one for males only. Complaints One thousand four hundred and forty-seven complaints were received with reference to the following matters, viz.: Absence of, or defective condition of, dustbins 9 Accumulation of refuse or manure 27 Blocked or defective drains 180 Defective roofs 60 Defective W.

Places of Public Entertainment The cinemas, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. The defects discovered as a result of these inspections were remedied after notice had been given to the persons responsible.

Food Hygiene Continuing the Winter programme in the Clean Food Campaign, four talks and film shows for traders and the general public were given in January. A total of five hundred and ninety three letters were sent, including thirty-three to Head Offices of multiple firms; posters were exhibited on Council notice boards, and, in addition, a circular letter was sent to nineteen local organisations. The response was poor as may be seen from the following table: Date Letters Sent Attendance : Traders and General Public 8.1.52 173 8 16.1.52 171 28 22.1.52 108 8 29.1.52 141 2 Totals 593 46 Lectures to Organisations One lecture was given to a Women's Organisation and an audience of twenty members attended. Lectures and Film Shows to School Children In the Spring, lectures to classes of senior school children were arranged at four schools, and the audience totalled 137 children. Further lectures were arranged in the Summer at Christ's College and 50 scholars attended. In November a talk was given and films were shown at another school to 67 children. 34 Course of Evening Lectures at Finchley County School In conjunction with the Borough Education Officer a course of evening lectures at the Finchley County School was arranged. This course, which commenced in the Autumn and continued into 1953, consisted of ten weekly lectures, each lecture being of 1½ hours duration. The lectures were given by your Sanitary Inspectors. Public response was again rather poor, as at the beginning of the course only seventeen students attended. This number was reduced to three at the last lecture. Display of Dog Notices in Food Shops Notices for exhibition have been supplied to all food shops in the district, pointing out that the presence of dogs is a danger to the health of the public. Byelaws—Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 Copies of the Byelaws have been supplied to all traders in the district and inspections made to ascertain that the provisions thereof are being complied with. In this connection improvements have been carried out, including the following: Bacon bench repaired 1 Dustbins provided 3 Extractor Fan provided 1 Flue pipe repaired 1 New composition floor in shop 1 New frying ranges 2 New washing facilities 1 Notices in W.Cs. re handwashing 6 Premises cleansed 8 Refrigerator provided 1 Shopping bag rests provided 1 Sinks and draining boards provided 3 Sneeze screens provided 2 Towels provided 8 Waste pipe and trap provided 1 Waterheaters provided 9 35 A number of traders have been prosecuted (particulars of the cases will be found under the heading "Legal Proceedings") for offences under the byelaws, and for failure of hawkers to exhibit their names and addresses on their barrows. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared has received special attention. Five new registrations of hawkers were granted during the year. Before registration is granted the Council insist upon satisfactory storage accommodation being provided and this is checked up where necessary with the Local Authority concerned. Following such an investigation, one application for registration was refused. The number of barrow boys operating in the district is now only 5. One thousand and sixty-four visits were made to various food premises and improvements have been carried out in a number of cases. 36 Carcases Inspected and Condemned Cattle excluding cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed — — 1 — 41 Number inspected — — 1 — 41 All diseases except Tuberculosis : Whole carcases condemned - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - 1 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis - - - - 2.44 Tuberculosis only: Whole carcases condemned - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - - Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis - - - - - 37 UNSOUND FOOD CONDEMNED, 1952 Tuberculosis Cattle 1 Hindquarter Other Diseases Pigs 1 Pluck (Pneumonia and Pericarditis) Unsound Cattle 530½ lbs.

Occasional slaughtering is carried out on permit from the Food Office. Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933, all animals, including sheep, slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. The number of persons licensed under xhe Act during 1952 was 2. 41 Butchers' Shops There are 48 butchers' shops in the Borough. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. These premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough is 28. At 25 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. At one bakehouse extensive repairs were carried out, includ ing a conversion of two ovens from solid fuel to gas firing. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops There are 9 registered premises within the district, and all have been inspected from time to time. In one large dairy a new bottle washing machine and a capping machine were installed. Milk (Special Designations) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1952, as follows: Dealers'Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 17 „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 16 „ „ „ „ Sterilised 20 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 7 „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 8 „ „ „ Sterilised 8 Three samples of T uberculin Tested (Pasteurised) milk, two samples of Pasteurised and two samples of Sterilised were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination. All these samples complied with the prescribed conditions. 42 Food Sampling The following table has been furnished by the Middlesex County Council Public Control Department relative to samples taken in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938: Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk, various 334 33 Almonds, ground 1 — Baking Powder 1 — Cakes, various 31 — Coffee and Chicory Essence 1 — Curry Powder 1 — Drugs 3 — Fish Cake 1 — Fish 21 4 Flour 1 — Frying Oil 1 — Herrings in Sauce 1 1 Ice Cream 3 —- Jam 3 — Jelly 2 — Liqueur Truffles 2 2 Marmite 1 — Meat Pies 1 — Meat, Cooked 4 — Prunes 1 — Rice 1 — Sausages 24 — Soup 2 — Suet 1 — Tomato Ketchup 1 — Victoria Plums 2 2 Vinegar 14 1 Whisky 8 — High Protein Food 1 — 468 43 43 The 33 milk samples were all samples of raw new milk, delivered by 8 farmers to the A.l. and Dollis Dairies Ltd., of Whetstone and 2 to the Express Dairy Company Ltd., at College Farm. The samples were each low in fat or low in milk solids-not fat or both; in no case to a considerable extent. There was no added water nor was there evidence in any case of abstraction. In some cases the slight deficiency was in one churn out of many associated in the delivery and no further action was taken. In other cases the deficiences were drawn to the attention of the farmers concerned, the receiving firm and the Milk Marketing. Board. The 4 samples of fish relate to two cases of alleged sales of smoked cod for smoked haddock. One trader was prosecuted in respect of two such sales contrary to Section 3 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 and for applying a false trade description "Haddock Fillets" to cod exposed for sale, contrary to Section 2(2) of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887. She was fined a total of £15 and ordered to pay £3 3s. Od. costs. The other trader was. prosecuted but the two summonses (under Section 3 of the 1938 Act) were dismissed upon a conflict of evidence. The sample of herrings "in wine sauce" was reported upon as unsatisfactory because the amount of proof spirit was insufficient, in the opinion of the Public Analyst, to justify the description "wine sauce". Upon the undertaking of the firm satisfactorily to amend the description in future a caution only was issued. The two samples of "liqueur truffles" were examples of false description by one firm in that the sweets were non-alcoholic flavoured chocolates. An official caution was issued upon an undertaking by the makers and the labellers to discontinue the description. The two samples of Victoria plums relate to the exposure for sale by two retail fruiterers of Giant Prune Plums labelled "Victorias". In each case an official caution was issued. The sample of unsatisfactory "Vinegar" relates to a sale of coloured, dilute acetic acid for vinegar. A warning was given the trader. 44 Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only one person makes ice cream within the Borough, and employs the method known as "complete cold mix" which only requires the addition of water. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 144 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Thirty-five samples were taken during the year. Coffee Stalls The number of coffee stalls in the Borough is two. Both are situated on the main roads. They are visited at intervals and action is taken to secure the provision of a satisfactory water supply, suitable means of food storage, cleanliness of stalls and utensils and proper means for the storage and disposal of refuse. Fish Friers This business is established at 8 premises, one business closing down during the year. Game Licences Twenty applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. Shops Act 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. Particulars in regard to the shops on the Register are as follows: Number on Register at beginning of 1952 873 Number closed 10 New shops 28 Number on Register at end of 1952 891 Changes of occupancy 25 45 Swimming Pools In co-opcration with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor samples of the water were taken at intervals throughout the summer months. On all occasions the bacteriological reports on these samples were satisfactory. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and in quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company and copies of reports on 11 samples which were taken by the Company during the year and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Counties Public Health Laboratory were forwarded to me. In addition 1 sample was submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. In all cases the results were satisfactory. All dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses with the exception of 4 houses serving a population of 10 which are served by standpipes. Pollution of Streams and Watercourses Arising from investigations and complaints regarding the pollution of streams in and adjoining the district, in conjunction with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor an examination of the surface water sewers was made in various parts of the Borough and samples of the effluent taken in an endeavour to trace the source of the pollutions. The sanitary inspectors made 556 visits to various premises and arising therefrom it was found that at 26 of the premises inspected various soil fittings, etc., as set out below were discharging into the surface water sewers. School. All soil fittings (W.Cs., urinals and washbasins) 1 Wastepipes from sinks and baths 16 Potato peeling machines 2 Waste from box washing at fish shop 1 Waste from public house bar 1 Blocked soil drains overflowing into surface water drains 3 46 Oil from domestic heating apparatus 3 Wastes from electric washing machines 2 All these contraventions were dealt with without recourse to legal action. With the increasing use of oil fuel for domestic heating, serious nuisance can arise from pollution of sewers, streams, etc., if the plant is not correctly installed. In the absence of legislation with regard to the fixing of such installations this matter presents some difficulties. Smoke Abatemfnt The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally little nuisance from smoke or grit has occurred. At one bakehouse two ovens were converted from solid fuel to gas firing. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 The above Act, which came into operation on the 1st November, 1951, controls premises in which rag flock and other filling materials are used in the making of new articles. There is only one trader whose premises come within the definition of the Act, and are registered. Pet Animals Act, 1951 This Act, which came into operation on 1st April, 1952, empowers a local authority to license persons for the sale of pets. In determining the granting of a licence, regard shall be had to the following conditions:— (a) that animals will at all times be kept in accommodation suitable as respects size, temperature, lighting, ventilation and cleanliness; (b) that animals will be adequately supplied with suitable food and drink and (so far as necessary) visited at suitable intervals; (c) that animals, being mammals, will not be sold at too early an age; (d) that all reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent the spread among animals of infectious diseases; (e) that appropriate steps will be taken in case of fire or other emergency. 47 An inspection of the pet shops within the district was carried' out and in consequence thereof 3 persons have been licensed. Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following instances: (1) Three street traders were summoned for 5 offences including 1 case of failure to register as a hawker under Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, and 4 instances of failure to exhibit names and addresses as required by the byelaws made under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Fines amounting to £6-0-0 and costs totalling £2-2-0 were imposed. (2) Proceedings were instituted against the owner of premises for failure to comply with a Statutory Notice served under the Public Health Act 1936, requiring the abatement of a nuisance arising from a defective roof. An application for an Order to be made against the Council to do the necessary repairs, in default of the owner, was granted. 48 RODENT CONTROL During the year 462 complaints were received. Three hundred and eight of these dealt with rat infestations and the remaining 154 with mice infestations. The following table shows that, in comparison with last year, rat complaints decreased whilst mice complaints slightly increased. Premises from which complaints have been received Premises where infestation was confirmed Premises where infestation was not confirmed 1951 1952 1951 1952 1951 1952 Rats 319 308 229 223 90 85 Mice 141 154 130 149 11 5 Total 460 462 359 372 101 90 Arising from these complaints, rats were found at 101 additional premises. There were 48 instances of rats found in and around places, where poultry was kept. This figure represents 14.81% of the infestations. 49 Summary of Infestations Rats Mice Visits in connection with infestations 4285 1037 Number of confirmed infestations 324 149 Prebaits 4985 — Zinc Phosphide 289 20 Arsenic P O 57 — Red Squill I S 24 — A.N.T.U o N 60 — Barium Carbonate S 6 — Warfarin 246 131 Twelve smoke tests were applied to rat runs, revealing defects in drains or sewers at two premises. During the year, Warfarin has been used in connection with the destruction of rats and mice, and has proved to be very successful. A complaint of rats and mice was received from a large factory. A servicing firm had been employed at these premises for many years and there is no doubt that a poison prejudice had been set up by inefficient work. This prejudice caused a great amount of unnecessary work, but, although at the end of the year the premises were not free from rats, the number of rats within the curtilage was considerably reduced. I am pleased to report that the Sewage Works and Refuse Destructor are now practically free from rats: 50 Treatment of Sewers Sausage Rusk with Zinc Phosphide, and Bread Mash with Arsenic were used alternately, in carrying out the maintenance treatment of sewers. Two maintenance treatments were carried out during the year when 1,053 manholes were baited. The results were as follows :— First Treatment Second Treatmont Total number of manholes baited 501 552 Number of poison takes 22 29 The poison takes in each treatment amounted to 4.39% and 5.25% of the number of manholes baited. 51 INDEX Page Bacteriological Work 20 Bakehouses 42 Births and Birth Rate 5,6,7 Burial of the Dead 23 Butchers' Shops 42 Carcases Inspected and Condemned 37 Coffee Stalls 45 Committee Members 3 Complaints 30 Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops 42 Deaths and Death Rate 5,6,7,9,13 Diphtheria 16, 17 Diphtheria Immunisation 16 Disinfection 29 Disinfestation 29 Enquiries— Outstanding Sanitary Notices 29 Factories 31 Fish Friers 45 Food Hygiene 34 Food Poisoning 34 Food Sampling 43 Game Licences 45 Houses Let in Lodgings 29 Houses Unfit for Human Habitation 25 Housing Statistics 24 Ice Cream Premises 45 Infantile Mortality 5,6,10,11 Infectious Diseases 16 Inspections by Sanitary Inspectors 26 Legal Proceedings 48 Malaria 19 Maternal Mortality 5,9 Measles 19 Meat and Food Inspections 36 Medical Examinations 23 Milk (Special Designations) Regulations 42 52 Page Mortuary 9 National Assistance Act, 1948 23 Notices Served 28 Persons in Need of Care and Attention 23 Pet Animals Act, 1951 47 Places of Public Entertainment 31 Pneumonia 19 Poliomyelitis 19 Pollution of Streams and Watercourses 46 Population 5,6 Puerperal Pyrexia 19 Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 47 Rodent Control 49 Sanitary Circumstances of the Area 24 Sanitary Conveniences 30 Sanitary Improvements carried out 27 Scarlet Fever 16 Shops Act, 1950 45 Slaughter of Animals 41 Slaughterhouses 41 Slaughtermen 41 Smoke Abatement 47 Staff 3 Statistics 5, 15 Stillbirths 5,6 Swimming Pools 46 Tuberculosis 20,21 Unsound Food 38 Vital Statistics 15 Water Supply 46 Whooping Cough 19 53 Printed by Finchley Press Ltd., 176 High Road.
