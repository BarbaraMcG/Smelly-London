The numbers of either males or females who have died of pulmonary tuberculosis have not shewn any uniform trend during these last ten years. The numbers of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung or bronchus are of interest in view of trends shewn by national figures. The Table does however show the higher incidence in men for both diseases, and that over the last four years these neoplasms have produced a wastage of life greater than that of pulmonary tuberculosis. 19 SECTION 3.

Notifications During the year 258 cases of infectious disease were notified, of which 85 were removed to hospital. These are tabulated in the age groups (see Table No. 6, page 22). Comparative figures of infectious disease for the years 1922-1955 are also shown (see Table No. 7, pages 24 and 25). Diphtheria It is very gratifying to report that for the fifth year in succession no case of diphtheria was notified. Dysentery Four cases were notified and three were removed to hospital. Enteric Fever No cases of typhoid fever were notified during the year. Erysipelas One case was notified and was treated at home. Food Poisoning Twelve cases were notified, none of which necessitated removal to hospital. Eleven of the cases occurred in an outbreak at a private hostel. Salmonella thompson organisms were isolated from two of the patients, and cultures from a sample of cold meat which was under suspicion showed a growth of staphylococci aureus pyogenes. The origin of the infection remained unknown. Measles One-hundred and seventy-two cases were notified and twenty-two were removed to hospital. One case removed to hospital was subsequently re-diagnosed as rubella. Meningococcal Infection Two cases were notified and were removed to hospital. Ophthalmia Neonatorum One case was notified and was treated at home. 21 Poliomyelitis Twelve cases were notified, all of which were removed to hospital. Only three of these cases were Holborn residents. Puerperal Pyrexia No cases were notified during the year. Scabies Five cases were notified, and were treated at home. Scarlet Fever Four cases were notified, and one of them was removed to hospital. Smallpox In March a ship arrived at the Port of London having had a case of modified smallpox on board. The patient had been landed at Suez. Twenty passengers presumed to be contacts were kept under observation for the period of surveillance remaining after landing. Tuberculosis See page 50.

This work is carried out by the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, 23 Queen Square, W.C.I, and by the Public Health Laboratory Service at County Hall. During the year 57 specimens were submitted for examination with the following results:— Disease Positive Negative Total Diphtheria (Nasal and throat swabs) — 15 15 Dysentery (Faeces) 3 5 8 (Faecal swabs) 4 20 24 Food Poisoning (Faeces) 2 4 6 (Other specimens) 1 1 2 Streptococcus haemolyticus 5 4 9 Vincents organisms — 10 10 Other pathogenic organisms 6 4 10 Infectious Disease Contacts Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are paid only on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was not found necessary to issue any such certificates during the year. International Certificates of Vaccination against Cholera and Smallpox The International Sanitary Regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly on 25th May, 1951, prescribe inter alia that International Certificates, to be valid, must bear an approved stamp which certifies that the signature of the vaccinator is that of a doctor. During the year 280 certificates of persons travelling abroad were authenticated by the Department. Of these 252 were in respect of smallpox, 22 for cholera, and 6 for typhoid. Diphtheria Immunisation During the year 419 Holborn residents completed immunisation against diphtheria. 24 25 TABLE No.7 Comparative Figures of Infectious Disease for the last 30 years Disease 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 (Population) 43,200 42,209 39,280 38,380 38,380 34,470 36,440 36,050 36,000 35,400 34,850 34,600 34,350 30,660 23,470 17,160 16,580 17,240 18,020 18,680 21,190 23,460 24,960 25,490 25,930 24,540 23,950 23,710 23,340 23,060 Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup) 73 54 57 72 80 69 76 75 74 93 60 76 49 19 7 14 17 17 5 11 12 3 2 1 2 — — — — — Dysentery — — 2 2 — 2 1 — 2 6 6 10 10 — — — — 2 13 2 6 — 4 — 2 34 9 8 34 4 Encephalitis Lethargica 1 — — 1 1 — 1 1 1 1 — — — 2 — — — — — 1 — — — — — — — 1 — — Enteric Fever 5 4 10 5 4 4 4 1 3 2 2 — — 1 1 3 1 6 1 — 1 1 1 — 1 — 2 1 2 — Erysipelas 14 21 23 22 29 17 17 19 12 18 19 10 15 13 12 3 7 3 8 3 4 8 6 5 3 1 2 1 1 1 Food Poisoning Notifiable as from 12th July, 1932. 11 5 — — 3 5 2 — — — — — — 1 — 1 2 3 1 2 1 4 2 12 Malaria — 1 1 1 — — 1 1 1 3 2 3 — 1 — — — 1 — — — — — — 1 1 — 1 1 — Measles Notifiable as from 9th S|eptem ber, 19 38. — 8 39 34 58 219 33 103 107 157 87 170 137 254 133 195 37 172 Meningococcal Infection 2 — 1 — — 4 1 3 1 1 2 1 1 3 7 7 1 1 — 1 2 2 — — — — — 2 1 2 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 6 9 10 6 5 7 4 6 6 4 3 3 5 4 4 1 5 4 4 1 4 3 3 3 2 — 2 3 — 1 Pneumonia (Acute primary & Acute-influenzal) 39 48 59 89 49 40 28 37 38 21 30 34 21 28 14 18 20 22 14 6 17 15 9 9 5 8 4 4 4 — Polio-encephalitis Acute — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1 1 — — — — — — — — Poliomyelitis Acute — — — — 1 1 2 — — — — — — — — — — — — 1 — 5 1 2 2 — 6 17 3 12 *Puerperal Fever 3 3 4 1 3 2 1 3 3 4 2 4 — — — 1 2 2 2 2 — 1 1 * * • * * * * Puerperal Pyrexia 1 8 7 5 6 4 6 5 2 4 3 2 2 3 3 2 7 3 1 4 S 5 2 4 2 3 1 — — — Scabies Notifiable as from 1st Au gust, 1 943. 54 99 125 106 43 16 4 3 4 3 6 1 5 Scarlet Fever 84 59 111 130 90 57 57 96 115 50 67 38 59 56 20 16 23 30 20 14 24 29 13 15 16 21 18 10 5 4 Smallpox — — 1 43 14 3 1 1 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Tuberculosis Pulmonary 66 91 91 76 76 80 73 50 83 68 77 66 71 64 44 47 45 51 41 59 55 47 39 42 39 45 46 48 32 40 Tuberculosis, Non-Pulmonary 26 20 14 12 10 8 16 9 6 5 13 10 8 5 3 6 8 3 9 9 5 4 8 6 5 — 2 3 4 4 Whooping Cough 96 82 104 153 33 44 108 23 65 99 76 60 53 71 7 42 48 38 30 11 43 23 74 5 90 33 32 62 6 1 416 400 495 618 401 342 408 335 412 379 365 322 296 78 161 194 242 456 280 364 392 348 268 269 311 406 261 366 133 258 *Ceased to be notifiable as from 30th July, 1948. 26 SECTION 4.

Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. Three complaints were received regarding unsatisfactory drinking water. In one case the Metropolitan Water Board collected a sample, and on analysis the water proved to be satisfactory. In the other two cases complaint arose through treatment of storage tanks with a bituminous preparation after cleansing. Drainage During the year 3,470 inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 124 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 117 Combined Drainage Orders were made. Smoke Abatement During the year 29 complaints were received regarding smoke nuisances and 358 observations were made. In most cases, it was found that the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Sanitary Inspectors. 30 Measurement of Deposited Matter and Sulphur Dioxide Since 1953 these forms of pollution have been recorded each month by means of apparatus installed on the roof of the British Museum. The apparatus consists of a deposit gauge for collecting rainwater and deposited matter, and a lead peroxide instrument for recording the amount of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The recordings obtained during 1955 were as follows:— Month Rainfall Monthly deposit—Tons per sq. mile Mg. of S03/day collected by 100 sq. cm. of Batch A Pb02 inches pH value Insoluble matter Soluble matter Total solids January 2.02 4.9 13.83 20.30 34.13 7.04 February 1.15 5.1 7.25 8.18 15.43 5.43 March 0.84 5.0 12.05 10.81 22.86 4.98 April 0.36 5.0 7.50 4.24 11.74 3.54 May 4.27 5.0 10.10 12.42 22.52 2.86 June 2.25 4.9 9.29 8.79 18.08 2.89 July 0.12 5.2 2.89 1.34 4.23 1.76 August 0.91 4.8 8.38 6.51 14.89 2.17 September 1.93 5.3 6.97 6.88 13.85 3.01 October 2.46 5.7 7.82 8.76 16.58 4.28 November 0.47 5.7 8.09 9.29 17.38 5.33 December 1.86 6.7 12.66 14.46 27.12 6.47 Total 18.64 — 106.83 111.98 218.81 — Monthly Average ... 1.55 5.28 8.90 9.33 18.23 4.15 The solid matter expressed in tons falling over the area of Holborn month by month is as follows:— Month Insoluble matter Soluble matter Total solids January 8.75 12.85 21.60 February 4.59 5.18 9.77 March 7.63 6.84 14.47 April 4.75 2.68 7.43 May 6.39 7.86 14.25 June 5.88 5.56 11.44 July 1.83 .85 2.68 August 5.30 4.12 9.42 September 4.41 4.35 8.76 October 4.95 5.54 10.49 November 5.12 5.88 11.00 December 8.01 9.15 17.16 31 Daily Measurement of Suspended Matter During the latter part of the year apparatus for making daily estimations of smoke was installed by the Council at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, and at the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, Queen Square. The apparatus consists mainly of an air pump which draws a known volume of air from outside and passes it through a white filter paper. The amount of smoke collected is estimated by comparing the stain on the paper with a calibrated scale of shades. The apparatus was not in operation during 1955 for sufficient time to allow of any useful records to be included in this report. Smoke Observation Posts From early May observations of the emission of smoke were made from the roofs of four high buildings suitably situated so as to provide a fairly complete view of the Borough. It was found that most of the smoke came from private houses, flats, and offices where open fires were in use, and, as might be expected, was found to be worse during the colder months of the year. With regard to industrial and commercial undertakings and hospitals, the observations confirmed the view that there are no continuous offenders of this type in the Borough. Nevertheless, there were occasions when the emissions from chimneys, although not statutory nuisances, were such that it was felt that some improvement might be secured. In these instances inspections and discussions took place which resulted in reduced smoke emission. Bombed Sites Accumulations of refuse on bombed sites continue to present a problem, although fortunately a number have disappeared as a result of rebuilding. In very few cases are the accumulations such as to warrant the service of notice in respect of a " nuisance"; and there is also the difficulty of assessing responsibility for the accumulations. In 1949 the Council made a by-law governing fly tipping on vacant sites in the Borough, but considerable difficulty is experienced in tracing offenders. Sites cleared by Council, e.g., bedding removed 20 War-Time Reservoirs for Emergency Water Supplies It has been agreed by the Home Office that the cost of cleansing emergency water tanks should rank for 75% grant under the Civil Defence Act, 1948, the remaining 25% of the cost to be borne by the London County Council as fire authority, and that the work of cleansing be done by the Metropolitan Borough Councils as agents for the London County Council. As a result of this arrangement one emergency water tank in Holborn was cleansed during the year. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 This Act, the Poisons Rules, 1952/55, and the Poisons List Order, 1952/55, regulate the sale of poisons, and every local authority is required to keep a list of persons who are entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. During the year 1955, 34 applications were received for retention on this Council's list. One application was received for entry on the list. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 This Act and the Regulations of 1951, require the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used in connection with certain upholstering and filling processes, and require premises used for the manufacture or storage of rag flock to be licensed.

In cases where overcrowding is abated, a warning letter is sent to the owner of the premises drawing attention to the relevant provisions of the Housing Act, 1936. 33 Rodent Control Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 This Act lays a duty upon a local authority to see that their district is kept free from rats and mice. It empowers them to carry out inspections and to require owners and occupiers to keep their land and premises free from infestation. Occupiers are required to give notification in writing of infestation by rats or mice to the local authority. Report for 12 months ended 31st iMarch, 1956 The following particulars were supplied to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in accordance with Article 1 (c) of the Conditions of Exchequer Grants to Local Authorities dated 28th July, 1950:— Type of Property Local Authority Dwelling Houses Agricultural All other (including Business and Industrial) Total 1.

The treatments, which consisted of direct poison baiting using 1 % by weight sodium monofluoroacetate in damp sausage rusk, have been carried out at three-monthly intervals since October, 1951. They were discontinued after July, 1955, as it was thought unlikely that further useful information could be obtained by continuing the experiment. The Ministry have kindly supplied the following summary of the results obtained during the past year:— Treatment No. of sites baited No. of sites at which bait was eaten % of sites at which bait was eaten No. of bodies recovered No. Date 14.

There were no cases arising during the year which called for action under the above Acts by the Public Health Department, but visits were made in connection with the voluntary removal of aged and infirm persons living alone, to hospitals or other places and in connection with the provision for such persons of home nursing and home help facilities. 36 Burial of the Dead Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died in the area, or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body are otherwise likely to be made. Such cases are those of persons who die in poor circumstances, and, with few exceptions, have no known relatives. Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have been asked by the Minister to exercise their powers to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of such persons dying in hospital. This Circular does not apply to voluntary hospitals, of which there are two in the Borough, namely the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Italian Hospital, Queen Square. During the year six cases were dealt with, at a total cost of £73 7s. 6d. The total amount recovered during the year in respect of burials was £95 15s. 10d. The cases had come to the notice of the Public Health Department from the following sources:— French Hospital 2 Coroner's Officer 3 Friends or Relatives of Deceased 1 Legal Proceedings Nature of Offence Action Taken Under Result Selling food not of the Section 3 of the Food and Fined £2.0.0. Council quality demanded. Drugs Act, 1938 awarded £3.3.0 costs. (Mould on sausage rolls). New Legislation The Food and Drugs Act, 1955 This Act, which came into operation on the 22nd November, 1955, is a consolidating Act. It repeals and consolidates the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, and certain sections of the Slaughterhouses Act, 1954 and the Slaughter of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1954. Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 These Regulations take the place of Section 13 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, which was repealed by the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, and also add a number of new provisions as to the hygienic handling of food and the construction, maintenance and repair of premises, stalls, and vehicles where food is handled. The coming into force of certain of the Regulations is deferred until the 1st July, 1956, where, for example, alterations to premises are necessitated. Local authorities are empowered to give certificates of exemption from certain requirements if, through special circumstances (such as restricted accommodation), compliance with the provisions concerned cannot reasonably be required. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955 Gives additional power for securing the remedying of defective drains, and for securing the restoration of water supply to any occupied building where the Metropolitan Water Board cease to supply water because of defects in pipes and fittings. It also gives power where unreasonable delay would result in following the procedure of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in connection with certain nuisances, for a local authority to execute the necessary works and to recover the cost. 37 SECTION 5. Factories. Most of the provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, are administered by the Ministry of Labour and National Service through H.M. Factory Inspectors. The Sanitary Authority is charged with the duty of enforcing the legislation as to sanitary accommodation in all factories in its area, and, in those factories where mechanical power is not used, legislation with regard to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, and drainage of floors. All factories must have an adequate supply of drinking water from a public main or some other source approved in writing by the Council. Particulars of inspections and other work carried out during 1955 are as follows:— Number of visits to:— Factories with mechanical power 95 Factories without mechanical power 5 Outworkers' rooms 5 Electrical stations and sites of building operations 164 Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948 The following particulars are furnished in accordance with Section 128 (3) of the principal Act, with respect to matters under Part I and Part VIII:— Part I of the Act 1.

" Dairy " does not include a shop from which milk is supplied only in the properly closed and unopened vessels in which it is delivered to the shop, or other place in which milk is sold for consumption on the premises only. " Distributor" includes a purveyor of milk whether by wholesale or retail. Most distributors now sell 42 milk in the bottles and cartons in which they receive it from the wholesaler, and consequently their premises are not required to be registered as dairies. Dairies registered during 1955 Nil Dairies on register at end of 1955 3 Distributors registered during 1955 3 Distributors removed from register during 1955 2 Distributors on register at end of 1955 66 Number of above distributors trading from premises outside Borough 27 Inspections made by Inspectors during 1955 44 Formal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 162 Informal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 2 During 1955, 162 formal and 2 informal samples of milk were taken.

Upon being satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with, a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area from which the designated milk is to be sold. Where a distributor holding a dealer's licence to use a special designation in respect of milk sold from premises in one area, wishes to sell milk within the area of another Licensing Authority, the latter authority may issue a dealer's supplementary licence authorising the use of the designation in their area. During the year 173 licences were issued, details of which are as follows:— Dealer's Dealer's Licences Supplementary Licences To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 28 24 To sell Pasteurised milk 41 24 To sell Sterilised milk 32 24 Milk—Bacteriological Exaimination During the year, 84 samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination. 22 of these were from milk supplied to schools in the Borough and four to a Day Nursery. 44 Registration of Premises used for the Manufacture, Storage or Sale of Ice Cream Premises used for the manufacture, storage or sale of ice cream are required by Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, to be registered by the local authority. On the 1st January, 1955, one set of premises was registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, in Holborn, and 102 premises were registered for storage and sale. During the year 4 applications were received and approved in respect of premises to be used for storage and sale. At the end of the year, there was one registration for manufacture, storage and sale, and 106 premises were registered for storage and sale. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, Etc.) Regulations, 1947 During the year, 78 samples of ice cream were submitted for examination by the Methylene Blue Test. The results in the grading suggested by the Ministry of Health were as follows:— Grade 1 61 Grade 2 9 Grade 3 2 Grade 4 2 Four iced lollies did not respond to the test. These samples were examined for the presence of faecal coli, which were found not to be present in 1 ml. of the samples. In the case of samples falling within Grades 3 and 4, letters were sent to the vendors drawing their attention to the poor grading. In such cases where the ice cream was manufactured outside Holborn, details were also sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas concerned. The results of all examinations of their own products were forwarded to the large manufacturers for their information. Licensed Premises There are 77 public houses in the Borough, and during the year 90 inspections were carried out. In addition, 52 reports were submitted to the Licensing Justices, in respect of premises where application had been made for the grant, re-grant or transfer of a licence under the Licensing Act, 1953. 45 Food Sampling A total of 491 samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Borough Analyst for chemical analysis during the year. 415 were formal samples and 76 were informal.

Twenty-eight applications were received for membership, and of these twenty-five were approved, bringing the total membership to one hundred for the first time. Since its formation every effort has been made to obtain a membership of at least one hundred, and the achievement was especially commendable at a time when a number of similar organisations in other areas have had to be discontinued for lack of support. One form of publicity undertaken successfully during the year was that of giving talks on food hygiene to a number of womens organisations in the Borough. As in previous years, the Borough Council assisted the Guild by means of publicity in the form of posters relating to food hygiene. 50 SECTION 7. Tuberculosis.
