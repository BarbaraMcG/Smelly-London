fri 10 Friern Barnet Urban District Council. REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health, FOR THE YEAR, 1913, BY FRANK A. SPREAT, F.H.C.S. Eng., D.P.H., R.C.P.S., Member of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. LONDON: Roberts Si Newton, Printers, Tottenham Lane. Crouch End. N. 1913. . TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE Friern Barnct Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1913, to which is attached the Report of Mr. Albert Harman, which again shows a good record of sanitary work done by him during the year. I have pleasure in expressing to the Members of the Council my appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and assistance during the past year. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Frank A. Spreat. For the convenience of the Local Government Board and those not well acquainted with the District, I repeat the following short description. The District of Friern Barnet is situated in the London area, and is bounded on the North by East Barnet, on the East by Southgate, on the South by Hornsey, and on the West by Finchley. It comprises 1,304 acres (including 152 acres occupied by the buildings and grounds of Colney Hatch Asylum) most of which is undulating ground, varying from 150 to 300 feet above the sea level, the geological formation being London clay, and here and there patches of gravel. 2 The General Character of the District.— For the purposes of representation, statistics, &c., it is divided into three WardsNorth, South and Central The North Ward (594 acres) and is that part of the district north of Friary Road and the footpath from Friern Lane east to Lilly Villas. The Central Ward (325 acres) comprises the middle part of the district North of Friern Barnet Road and west of the Great Northern Railway. The South Ward ,(233 acres) is the remaining portion of the district including the Site of the London County Asylum (Colney Hatch) 152 acres. The population is unevenly distributed. The North Ward is to a large extent pasture land and the houses for the most part are of a higher rateable value being detached. The more Northern portion of the Ward is being developed. The houses in the Central Ward are chiefly semide tached and in terraces and streets. The Western portion of the Ward adjoining Finchley is being actively developed. The South Ward is the most thickly populated, the houses being of the six roomed type, and are inhabited in many cases by more than one family. Vital Statistics. The population is obtained by counting the number of tenements actually inhabited at the middle of the year 1913 as assessed in the rate books and multiplying this figure by the factor 5.4. The factor 5.4 is obtained by dividing the census population of the district by the number of inhabited assessments in the middle of the census year. The population in 1881 was 4,405, in 1891 6,716, and in 1901 the total population at all ages at census: 11,566. 3 Total population at all ages at Census of 1911: District, 12,185; Asylum, 2,740 14,925 Number of inhabited houses 2,765 Average number of persons per house 5.4 The following table gives the number of occupied and unoccupied houses, together with the estimated population for each Ward for this year.

Births. These numbered 333, giving a birthrate of 23.3, being a decrease of 4.0. The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 333 113 120, the excess in 1908 being 213; in 1907, 177; in 1906, 152; in 1910, 240; in 1911, 169; in 1912, 239. Deaths. There were 79 deaths (Tables I., III. and IV.) registered in the district, excluding the Asylum, giving a death-rate of 5.5, an improvement of 2.4 on 1912. Thirty-four deaths occurred outside the District of persons belonging to it, but no deaths occurred in the District of persons not belonging to it, giving a net total of 79 + 34 — 0 = 113, showing a net death-rate of 7.9. Deaths occurring between 1 and 2 years— 6, viz., Diarrhoea 1, Nephritis 1, Congenital Defects 1, 111 defined Diseases 1, other defined Diseases 2. Between 2 and 5—3, the chief being, Scarlet Fever 1, Tuberculosis (not Phthisis) 2. Between 45 and 65.—There were 20 deaths, of which Phthisis 3, Cancer 8, Heart Disease 1, Bronchitis 3. Between 65 and upwards.—There were 34, of which. Old Age 4, Heart Disease 15, Cancer 2. Compared with 1912, the deaths besides being fewer occured later in life. 4 Infantile Mortality. The number of deaths under 1 year was 19, 3 less than in 1912, giving an infantile mortality rate of 57. The following is a table comparing the number of louses occupied and unoccupied, the population, births, birth.rate, deaths, and death.rate since 1885, giving an idea of the growth and health of the District during that period:— Year.

The Zymotic death-rate (deaths from the following diseases) Smallpox 0, Measles 1, Scarlatina 1Diphtheria 1, Whooping Cough 2, Diarrhoea 2, was 0.4; the lower rate being due to 3 deaths from Whooping Cough and Measles as compared with 12 last year.

The following is the record of work done during the past year by this very appreciated aid to diagnosis, of the specimens submitted for examinations 20 were swabs from the throat or ear, 19 Sputa from Phthisis and a scraping of suspected Ringworm; of the 20 Swabs 17, gave a negative result, two, the Klebs Loeffler Bacillus and one, the Hoffman Bacillus. Of the 19 specimens of suspected Sputa 11, gave negative results, and in 8 the Tubercle Bacillus were present in moderate numbers. The suspected Ringworm scraping gave a negative result. The total number of examinations made was 40—as against 26 for 1912. The increase is due to the larger number of examinations for the Tubercle Bacillus being 19 against 8 for 1912. No specimens were sent for the Widal test for Enteric against one in 1912. Scarlet Fever. 29 cases were notified as compared with. 23 in 1912, 18 in 1911 and, 14 in 1910. 25 cases were treated in 7 Hospital— all these cases were more or less sporadic in character. Enteric Fever. One case was notified. The disease was contracted, developed, and treated at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Puerperal Fever. One case was notified and proved fatal. Erysipelas. There were eight cases, three of which occurred in the Asylum. Mumps. There was a sharp outbreak of this disease in December just previous to the Xmas holidays. Glenthorne Road Infants School was badly affected there being 49 cases. The Xmas holidays seemed to have checked the spread of this complaint for enquiries made in the early days of 1914 showed that very few children were absent from school on this account. Whooping Cough. There have been a few cases of this disease during the year. Measles. There has been marked decrease in the number of cases. Cancer. There were 11 deaths, giving a death-rate of 0.8. Infectious Diseases other than those notifiable under the Act. 1913 is the fourth year of systematic notification of diseases by school teachers. The following notifications have been received from the schools excluding those renotified under the Notification Act. 8 School. Disease. Measles. Mumps. Chicken Pox. Whooping Cough. C. of E.

The great reduction is in the number of measles, 20 against 114 for 1912. We may expect the number of measles to keep low for a period until the infants departments of the schools are occupied by young children not immune from attack by previous infection. Midwives Act. There is one Midwife living within and working in the district. Isolation Hospitals. The District under an arrangement with the Southgate District Council, has six beds for the treatment of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria and Enteric Fever. Thirty-one cases have been removed to Hospital during the year. Provision is made for Small-pox, the District having made arrangements with the Middlesex Joint Small-pox Hospital Board for beds at Clare Hall. Infectious Diseases and the Means taken to Prevent Their Spread. On receipt of information respecting an infectious case the premises are visited, a printed list of instructions as to necessary precautions is given and explained, disinfectants are supplied, and the schools attended in the case of children, and their employers in the case of adults, notified. 9 Removal to an Isolation Hospital is offered, and when accepted, is carried out subject to beds being available. After recovery or removal of an infectious case disinfection of the room or rooms occupied is performed by means of formalin. Cleansing and stripping notices are served when necessary. Clothes, bedding, etc., are removed to Finchley, where they are put through the Defries Steam Disinfector. Diagnosis outfits and antitoxin are supplied free to medical men for use in cases occurring in the District, and the suspected specimens are examined and reported upon at the expense of the Council. Supplies of antitoxin are kept at the Council Chambers in the Central Ward, and at the residence of the Medical Officer of Health in the North Ward, and at that of the Sanitary Inspector. Medical men have availed themselves of this serym, both for acute cases and as a preventive. On the receipt of notification of Infectious Disease among pupils of the Elementary Schools, a form giving full particulars of contacts is sent to the Chief Medical Inspector of Schools for the County, and copies of this form are also sent to the School Teacher, and the Attendance Officer, with a view to their exclusion. Common Lodging Houses. There are not any. Moveable Dwellings. No caravans have encamped in the district. Canals. There are none in the District. Meat and Food Inspections. The Sanitary Inspector has continued to give this matter attention, and the butchers' shops and general food vendors' premises are under periodical inspection. The meat sold in the district is chiefly derived from the Meat Markets of London. 10 Pig Keeping. This industry has been under considerable observation. Offensive Trades. There are not any. Dust Disposal and Removal. This is undertaken by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. The collection is made weekly, and the dust removed in covered vans. Notices are served as required to provide portable sanitary dust-bins in place of worn-out or unsanitary bins. The refuse is chiefly taken to the Sewage Works and deposited on the ground. The provision of an up-todate Dust Destructor is before the Council, and the Committee have the matter under consideration. Ambulance. The District does not yet possess an Ambulance; arrangements have been made with the Finchley District Council for the hire of their conveyance. Mortuary. The Finchley District Council have an excellent Mortuary a short distance from Friern Barnet's West boundary, and arrangements have been made for its use. Coroner's Inquests. The large room on the West side of the Council Offices has been fitted up for Coroner's Inquests, and during the year a number of Finchley and Friern Barnet Inquests have been held here. The Council Offices being near the Finchley Mortuary, this room has been found convenient for holding Finchley Inquests. Formerly the Inquests were held at public-houses. 11 Legislation. The following Acts of Parliament, Bye-Laws, and Regulations are in force in your District:— Public Health Act, 1875. Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. Public Healths Acts Amendment Act, 1890.

Situation of the Works.— The Sewage Works are situated on the South side of the District (in Wood Green Parish), and within 100 yards of a small brook, into which the effluent flows. The original works were completed at the end of 1886, from designs furnished by Mr. Baldwin Latham, M.I.C.E., and were executed under his direction. The works have been extended by the Council from time to time under their Engineer and Surveyor and continue to produce a very satisfactory effluent. 12 The method of treatment is as follows: — The sewage, which enters the works by gravitation, is first passed through a revolving screen, after which a solution of Buxton lime equal to 4 grains per gallon is added, and the whole is thoroughly mixed. It then receives alumino-ferric to the extent of 1 grain per gallon, and is again well mixed by passing over a salmon ladder; and in this condition it flows into settling tanks, of which there are five, four having a capacity of 70,000 gallons, and the fifth which will hold 92,000 gallons. The overflow from the tanks first passes out of the tanks into an open Channel, then into the first Contact Bed, and through the filter or second Bacteria Beds into an effluent chamber, and thence into the brook referred to above. The roads in this District have separate sewers for storm water, and all houses, except the older ones, have the dual system of drainage. An endeavour is being made to carry the storm water from the old houses into the surface water sewersi. as opportunities occur. This is very necessary as everything should be done to make the flow of sewage at any sewage works as uniform as possible. The sewage from the Avenue and Ely Place section of the District has to be pumped to the Sewage Works, and in this case any rain water admitted to the sewers greatly increases the cost of lifting the sewage to the gravitation sewers. Water Supply. The Barnet Water Company now gives a constant and good supply. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops. A list of these will be found under the Scheme at the end of the Report. These have been constantly inspected, and suggestion for the personal cleanliness of the milkers and the grooming of the cows have again been urged. A veterinary surgeon has not yet been appointed. Four samples of milk were taken and found to comply with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act. 13 Slaughter Houses. There is only one in the District, subject to an annual licence. Public Elementary Schools. Disinfectants are supplied for use in the lavatories, and also to be added to the water with which the slates, desks and floors are washed. During the vacations the schools are thoroughly disinfected. I would again urge the necessity of a supply of paper in the school W.C's by the Managers. Inspections. I have inspected Sydney Terrace, The Avenue, Holmesdale, Stanhope, St. Paul's, Cromwell, Bawtry Roads, Clarke's and Jaques' Cottages, Pembroke Road, all the mews and urinals. Public Improvements. Athenaeum Road and Torrington Park have been made up. The Friary Park has been much appreciated. Lightng.— All-night lighting by means of Automatic Clockwork Controllers is now general throughout the District Additional lamps have been fixed and the lighting improved in many parts of the District. Allotments. The Council now possess Allotments in the North Ward on the Rathbone Estate and in the South Ward on the Sewage Farm. Housing. The Council has accepted a tender for the erection of 15 cottages in the South Ward. In this Ward there are 113 houses or tenements vacant compared with 200 in 1912. A considerable proportion of these are six roomed houses constructed and adapted for the use of one family. 14 In a large number of cases the houses (rented at 12 to 14 shillings per week) are occupied by more than one family. There have been few cases of overcrowding. A closing order has been made with regard to two wooden houses on the Great North Road. Tuberculosis. The notification of all forms of Tuberculosis is now compulsory under the completed Regulations issued in 1912. During the year 89 notifications under the regulations has been received, of these 32 belong to the district, 7 were received in error from other districts and were transferred to the Medical Officer of Health to whom they should have been sent in the first place. Forty-five were received from Colney Hatch Asylum, and were also transferred to the Medical Officer of the district in which the person resided previous to admission into the Asylum; and the remaining 5 were re-notifications of cases already numbered as belonging to this district. On reference to Table II. it will be seen that the notifications are about equally divided between Phthisis and all other forms of Tuberculosis. Of the 15 cases of Phthisis, three have been treated in Sanatoria with the following results: one greatly benefited, another improved, and the third still under treatment. The notified cases are visited and particulars recorded . Notification of Births Act, 1908. Forms or letters received 197 Total Births notified 200 Males 92 Females 90 Sex not stated 18 Still Births 2 Number of Births attended by Midwives 38 Visits requested 0 Visits by Voluntary Helpers 0 Visits by Sanitary Inspector 4 Numbers of Cards of Hints sent 197 15 In all cases where the mother is attended by a Midwife the notification forms are sent to the Chief Inspector under the Midwives Act, after the particulars are entered in the Register. There has been a slight increase in the percentage of Births notified as against the actual number of Births during the year. The figures are 1909 53 per cent. 1910 67 „ „ 1911 64 „ „ 1912 59.9 „ „ 1913 60 „ „ The percentage of births notified by midwives has fallen from 41 to 19. The provision of the Act are becoming more widely known, and this falling off is due to the fact that the notifications are received more frequently from the parents than from Midwives. Schools. 1, All Saints; 2, St. John's; 3, Friern Lane; 4, St. Paul's; 5, St. Peter's; 6 and 7, Middlesex County Schools (Sydney Road and Holly Park). All these seven schools have been frequently inspected, and have been found to be in good order. During epidemics the schools are visited and lists of absentees obtained, whose homes are visited. 16 TABLE I. Vital Statistics of Whole district during 1912 and Previous Years.

For years before 1911 somet of the corrected! rates probably will not be available. The rates should be calculated per 1000 of the estimated gross population. In a district in which large Public Institutions for the sick or infirm seriously affect the statistics, the rates in Columns 5 and 13 may be calculated on a nett population, obtained by deducting from the estimated gross population the average number ot Inmates not belonging to the district in such institutions. * In Column 6 are to be included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. In Column 12 is to be entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction pf this number in Column 8 and by addiition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are to be similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. 17 † The Medical Officer of Health will be able from the returns made to him by the local Registrar of Deaths, as well as from the quarterly lists furnished by the Registrar-General, to fill in Column 8 in accordance with the rule in the next paragraph below. The RegistrarGeneral, either directly or through the County'Me(diical Officer of Health, will supply the Medical Officer of Health with the particulars of deaths to be entered in Column 9: and all such deaths must be included in this Column, unless an error is detected, and its correction has been accepted by the Registrar-General. For Column 4 the Registrar-General will furnish to the Medical Officer of Health a Statement of the number of births needing to be added to or subtracted from the total supplied by the local Registrar. ‡ "'Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence, e.g., casuals, must not be included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (6) below. The Medical Officer of Health will state in Column 8 the number of transferable deaths of " non-residents " which are to be deducted, and will state in Column 9 the number of deaths of "residents" registered outside the district which are to be added in calculating the nett death-rate of his district. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in Institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses, and nursing homes (but not almshouses) must be regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an Institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district ot residence at the time of admission to the first Institution. (2) The deaths of infants Dorn and dying within a year of birth in an Institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement should be referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from Violence are to be referred (a) to the district ot residence, under the general rule; (6) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, it known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, it known; and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.

Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Report for the year ending 31st December, 1913, including a summary of the work carried out, for the suppression of nuisances, the means taken to check the spread of infectious diseases, and the general administration of the Public Health Acts so far as they relate to the office of the Inspector of Nuisances. Complaints. These numbered 71, as against 96 during 1912 and 111 during 1911, a decrease of nearly 26%, which considering the rapid growth of the population is very satisfactory. Three complaints related to the non-removal of house refuse and were handed to the Surveyor's Department to deal with. Nuisances. 103 intimation notices were served dealing with 264 nuisances, a classification of which will be found at the end of this report. Nuisances arising from structural defects tend to get less every year, as the older houses in the district are constantly under inspection, and the majority of the houses in the district are under 20 years old. It has only been necessary to serve 12 statutory notices for the abatement of nuisances, and no proceedings before the magistrates have been necessary. We have again had trouble with subsoil water causing flooding in cellars, this time in the South Ward. It was necessary in one case to completely surround the cellar with an open area, and to put subsoil drains therein. 31 The nuisances arising from accumulations of refuse have been very few. Practically every house in the district has a proper galvanised iron covered dustbin. There is a tendancy for tenants of the smaller houses to keep fowls in the back yards. In many cases this practice causes nuisance, especially in the hot weeks of the year. Nuisances arising from pig keeping have not been so numerous as in former years. There is no doubt that the boiling of " wash " is an offensive trade, and in a large number of instances it is the " wash " that gives rise to the nuisance. Further large piggeries have been erected on the eastern border qf the district. They are of similar construction to those already existing between Friern Lane and Oakleigh Road. Proceedings were taken Defore the Magistrates with a view to the prevention of the erection of these piggeries under the building byelawsl, but the magistrates decided that they were " exempted " buildings, and further erections are now being proceeded with. Slaughter Houses. There is only one in the district situated in the North Ward, and subject to an annual licence. It is used principally for the slaughter of sheep. The occupier keeps the premises in very clean condition. The laurage is practically unused, the animals being kept in a field in the adjoining district of Finchley. Offensive Trades. There are no trades carried on in this district which can be defined as " offensive " within the meaning of the Public Health Acts. There are three fish frying premises in the district which receive frequent attention from your Inspector, and no complaints have been received respecting these premises. The frying ranges are in each case of the old open hooded type, but every care is taken by the occupiers, to use good oil, and change it frequently. The fish sold at these premises is inspected very frequently and although of the cheapest kinds and very small, it is of undoubted freshness and quite wholesome. 32 Food Supply. The food supply of the district is derived mostly from the London markets, and the meat shows evidence of having been previously inspected. No complaints of unsound food having been sold have been received, and there is no doubt, that should a food vendor resident in the district become possessed of food the wholesomeness of which he suspected, he would communicate with your inspector before offering the same for sale. I have given the food hawkers' carts constant inspection, in fact I seldom allow one to pass me in the street without inspecting the contents, and have found nothing unwholesome or unfit for food. The milk supply of the district is good. In the early summer a sample of milk was taken from every farm supplying milk bo the district on its arrival by train. This work necessitated your inspector being about soon after 4 a.m., and the co-operation of the milk vendors, in allowing him to take the samples, and trace the source of them by the invoices, often at some inconvenience, is much appreciated. Twenty-two samples!, from cows on 25 farms were taken and submitted for examination for the Tubercle Bacillus, in each case, with negative result; every sample was further reported as free from pus or blood, and there is no doubt that considerable care is exercised by the farmers supplying milk to this district. Four informal samples of milk were taken and submitted to the public analyst, through the Middlesex County Inspector, and they were reported as " not adulterated." There are four Cowsheds in the district now in use and about 68 cows. There are six bakeries in the district, of these two are underground. They are frequently inspected. The remaining four are detached buildings at the rear of confectioners' shops. They are small, and often have considerable quantities of flour stored in them which encroaches on the air space. Another disadvantage is the fact that the frequent journeys between bakehouse and shop, through the yards carries dirt into the 33 house, and the floors soon become dirty again after cleansing. The bakehouses have been lime-washed during the year. Housing. The inspection of houses under the Inspection of District Regulations is progressing and complete records should be available by the end of 1914 for houses within the limit of rent applicable to the District under Sec. 14 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, viz., £16 per annum. There are about 500 houses in the district falling within the scope of the Regulations. All have been inspected since your inspector was appointed in 1905, some many times. Records have been kept of the nuisances discovered and the action taken for their abatement. There is a demand for cheap houses in the district but little likelihood of them being provided by private enterprise, for the tendency is for the erection of flats in the South Ward and " maisonettes " in the Central and North Wards. The labouring class of the population in this district still keep to the areas mentioned in my previous reports, but there is not so much overcrowding. Many houses have more than one family occupying where the sanitary accommodation is really only sufficient for one family. These houses do not fall within the scope of our "Tenement Byelaws " on account of the rent * limit and it is doubtful whether " Byelaws " are of any use in these cases. The best way is to deal with defects as they arise under the nuisance clauses of the Public Health Acts, and your inspector has found that much may be done by verbal advice given at the time of inspection. It has been necessary to make two representations of houses as unfit for human habitation respecting the two old wooden houses on the Great North Road. These houses are delapidated and one of them particularly dirty. They have no proper water supply. A closing order has been made and application has been made to the Magistrates to remove the occupiers, so far without success. 34 The Council now have under consideration the question of making a demolition order. The closing order, made in 1912, respecting Sydney Villa has expired. The owner voluntarily demolished the house in April, 1913. The closing order made in 1912 respecting two houses in Holmesdale Road has been determined. The owner could not be found. As the houses were getting into a dangerous state, the Council gave instructions for the Sanitary Inspector to take possession and have them properly hoarded. This work was done; eventually the ground landlord obtained possession, paid the expenses of the hoardings, and put the houses in very substantial repair. I have reported at length on Frank's Cottages, Jaques' Cottages, Friern Place, and Doncaster Terrace during the year. Petroleum Acts. One licence has been granted during the year. The premises were inspected twice per month and always found in order and agreeable to the conditions endorsed on the licence. Ambulance and Disinfections. The removal of patients to hospital and the disinfection of rooms after infectious disease remains as in past years. This work is becoming more difficult to perform every year, and takes a large portion of your inspector's time. The arrangements with Finchley for the use of their ambulance still stands as it did 10 years ago, meanwhile our population together with our neighbours has greatly increased, and delay often occurs now owing to the driver being engaged on work belonging to his own district which must be finished before he can come to Friern Barnet. As in past years I have received every possible assistance from the officers of the neighbouring districts of Finchley and Southgate in the removal of infectious diseases to hospital, but in case of epidemic, the present arrangements would be quite inadequate to deal with it in an efficient manner. 35 Factories and Workshops. These remain about the same as last vear and information respecting them is contained on the sheets issued by the Home Office. No infectious disease has occurred in outworkers' premises during the year. Clerical Work. Your inspector at present performs all the clerical work of the health department, and as the district grows and new legislation puts more work in hand so this work will increase. Apart from the preparation of the annual vital statistics, which absorbs a considerable amount of time during the months of January and February, there arrive from time to time requests for information respecting housing, water supply, etc., which your inspector is expected to answer or furnish, and this necessitates the searching of records, some times for years back. The following registers are kept in the Public Health Department:— Register of Nuisances. Register of House to House Inspections (under the Housing Regulations). Infectious Disease Records. Tuberculosis Notifications and Records (3 books). Notification of Births Act, Register and Record. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Register. Petroleum Licences. Slaughterhouse Licences. Register of Analyses and Bacteriological examinations. Register of Workshops, Outworkers, etc. Register of Notifications for County M.O.H. (Tuberculosis). Register of Notifications for County M.O.H. (Schools), Register and duplicates of Statutory Notices. 36 During the year the following written communications were received:— 238 respecting Nuisances or their abatement. 302 respecting Infectious Disease. 102 respecting the Notification of Tuberculosis. 213 respecting the Notification of Births Act. 303 respecting other work not classified in the above. Total 1,158 In conclusion I wish to express my thanks for the support of the Public Health Committee, and assistance rendered by fellow officers of the Council. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ALBERT HARMAN, Sanitary Inspector. 37 COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX.—SANITARY WORK, 1913. Sanitary District, Friern Barnet.
