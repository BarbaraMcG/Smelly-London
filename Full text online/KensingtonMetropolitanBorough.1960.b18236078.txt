KEN 69 The Poyal Borough of Kensington ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Health of the Borough THE YEAR I960 BY J. H. WEIR m.d.. b.s.. b.hy.. d.p.h. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH THE ROYAL BOROUGH OF KENSINGTON Telephone: WEStern 3173 Public Health Department, Hornton Street, Kensington, W.8. 1st June, 1961 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Royal Borough of Kensington. My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting the Annual Report on the state of the public health in Kensington for 1960. The Minister of Health has again requested (Circular l/6l) that the Report should be generally in the same form as has been the case for some years past. The public health in Kensington during the year under review was maintained at a satisfactory standard. Population. The population of the borough as ascertained at the Census in 1951 was 168,160: but for the purpose of this report, the population for 1960 has been estimated by the Registrar.General to be 167,240. The estimated population figure for the previous year was 166,500. Birth Rate. The number of live births per 1,000 population of the borough was 18.4 in 1960, which compares with the figure of 18.1 for the previous year. Death Rate. The number of deaths per 1,000 population in 1960 was 9.91, slightly lower than the death rate for the previous year (9.93). Area Comparability Factors for Birth and Death Rates. Comparisons of crude birth and death rates between local areas are not strictly valid since these rates take no account of the varying composition of the populations of the different areas by sex and age. In order to compare Kensington birth and death rates with England and Wales as a whole, the Registrar.General has, in the case of death rates since 1934, and, in the case of birth rates since 19491 supplied area comparability factors (A.C.Fs). This is considered to be necessary as the proportion of old people to young, and of males to females, varies considerably in different districts. The local crude death rates are affected as the mortality at the extremes of life is much greater than in the middle period, and, at practically all ages, the mortality in females is rather less than in males of corresponding ages. Similarly, so far as the local birth rates are concerned, the child bearing component of the population varies in different districts. In a borough such as Kensington, which has a higher proportion of females amongst its inhabitants compared with most other districts, the crude birth and death rates cannot be compared satisfactorily with those of, say, an industrial district, where the proportion of males is much higher. The Registrar.General has supplied, for use in Kensington in 1960, the figures 0.72 for births and 1.00 for deaths. The crude birth and death rates for the borough should be multiplied by the appropriate factor, and when so adjusted the results are comparable with the crude rates for England and Wales or with the corresponding adjusted rates for any other area. 2 The following table gives the adjusted Kensington birth and death rates compared with the provisional rates for London and for England and Wales for the year 1960:- Kensington adjusted London England and Wales No. of births per 1,000 population 13.2 17.8 17.1 No. of deaths per 1,000 population 9.91 11.4 11.5 Infant Death Rate,. This rate for 1960 was 20.8, a decrease compared with the rate for the previous year of 4.0. The provisional rate for the County of London was 21.6 and for England and Wales was 21.7. The following table shows the rates for the last five years:- Year Kensington London England and Wales 1960 20.8 21.6 21.7 1959 24.8 22.3 22.0 1958 22.7 22.6 22.5 1957 28.2 22.0 23.1 1956 21.1 21.0 23.8 It will be seen that the infant death rate for Kensington showed a decrease compared with last year's rate. Variations in the infant mortality rate are often caused by perinatal mortality, i.e. deaths in the first week of life, prematurity (see table below) and the statistical difficulties arising from the small numbers involved. Just over two deaths suffice to increase the rate by one. Number of deaths of babies under one week of age Year Age in days at death Total No. of deaths due to prematurity 1 or under 2 3 4 5 6 1956 24 4 4 2 4 - 38 21 1957 37 5 7 2 1 - 52 35 1958 37 5 3 2 2 1 50 29 1959 34 3 5 4 3 3 52 38 1960 27 4 - 4 - 2 37 22 1960 1959 Neo-natal mortality rate (i.e. deaths of infants under 4 weeks per 1,000 total live births) 18.52 19.49 Early neo-natal mortality rate (i.e. deaths of infants under one week per 1,000 total live births) 12.02 17.18 Perinatal mortality rate (i.e. stillbirths and deaths of infants under one week per 1,000 total live and still births) 25.95 34.73 Maternal Death Rate. Four deaths of mothers due to childbirth were recorded in 1960, giving a maternal death rate peril,000 live and still births of 1.28. (The provisional maternal mortality rate for the County of London was 0.45 and for England and Wales the 3 figure was 0.39) The causes of death given in respect of these four maternal deaths were (i) Obstructed labour (disproportion), (ii) Post partum haemorrhage following breech delivery, (iii) General Peritonitis due to ectopic gestation and (iv) Amniotic fluid embolism due to influenzal tracheo-bronchitis. Infectious Diseases. There was no serious outbreak of infectious disease in the borough during 1960. The total number of notifications received was 1,138 in comparison with 1,489 in the previous year. No case of diphtheria was notified in 1960. This is the fourth consecutive year giving a nil return; one case being notified in 1956. Only six cases of diphtheria have been notified in Kensington in the last ten years, in six of which there was a 'nil' return. Tuberculosis. The death rate from all forms of tuberculosis per 100,000 population was 8.4 which was higher than last year by 2.4. The 1960 Kensington death rate compares with the rate (provisional) of 7.5 for England and Wales. Lung Disease. Kensington's death rate from pulmonary tuberculosis per 100,000 population slightly increased in 1960 compared with the previous year, but the death rate for cancer of the lung showed a marked increase. Comparative figures for England and Wales showed a decrease in the rate in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis but a continuing increase in the death rate for lung cancer. The following table shows the trend in these diseases since the end of the war:- Year England and Wales Kensington Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cancer of the lung Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cancer of the lung Deaths Rate Deaths Rate Deaths Rate Deaths Rate 1947 19,753 47.3 9,204 22.0 71 43.0 58 34.9 1948 18,798 44.0 10,162 23.8 76 45.0 45 26.6 1949 17,471 40.5 10,975 25.5 56 32.0 50 28.7 1950 14,079 32.1 12,241 28.0 52 29.0 70 39.4 1951 12,031 27.5 13,247 30.2 36 17.5 70 40.9 1952 9,335 21.2 14,218 32.3 29 16.8 71 41.1 1953 7,913 17.9 15,132 34.3 26 15.1 65 37.9 1954 7,069 16.0 16,331 36.9 20 11.7 72 42.2 1955 5,838 13.1 17,271 38.9 12 7.1 73 43.1 1956 4,851 10.9 18,185 40.7 19 11.2 73 43.2 1957 4,250 9.5 19,118 42.6 13 7.7 90 53.6 1958 4,000 8.9 19,809 43.9 10 6.0 79 47.7 1959 3,475 7.7 21,063 46.4 9 5.4 75 45.0 1960 3,094 6.8 21,992 48.1 11 6.6 94 56.0 (Death rates quoted above are per 100,000 population) 4 It is of interest to note that whilst the death rate from lung cancer for the country as a whole has been increasing in recent years, the rate for Kensington has been fairly steady for a number of years, with the exception of 1957 and 1960, when marked increases were recorded. Housing. Further progress was made during the year in carrying out the slum clearance programme adopted by the Council in collaboration with the London County Council and approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The following four areas were represented and declared during 196O:. Kensal New Town No.4 area 7 premises " " " No. 5 " 20 " " " " No.6 " 6 " Railway Mews area 10 " In the case of Railway Mews area an objection was submitted by the owner of one property (No.5) that the building had not been used for human habitation and should be excluded from the Clearance Order. The Council decided to raise no objection. to this claim, and eventually the Minister of Housing and Local Government excluded this property when confirming the Clearance Order. Objections in respect of the other three areas were made by owners, and public local enquiries were held. The areas Kensal New Town No.4 and 6 were confirmed by the Minister on 25th May, 1961 without modification, but in the case of No.5 area the Minister's decision is still awaited. The Council are concentrating on dealing with the Kensal New Town area as a whole which consists of 21 acres. The first phase of 6½. acres has been dealt with,most of the slum property has been demolished and the erection of the two 14.storey blocks, each containing 78 flats, and the two 4.storey blocks of forty maisonettes and flats, are expected to be ready for occupation in 1961/62. After lengthy negotiations between this Council, the London County Council and the Paddington Borough Council tentative agreement has been reached on the division of responsibility in regard to the remainder of the Kensal New Town area. The main residential zone will now lie between Kensal Road and the railway, and the Council approved the following proposals in broad outline:. (i) The Borough Council will undertake the redevelopment of 3.1 acres to the north and 1.62 acres to the south of the 6½ acres upon which they are at present engaged. This area, including the present acres, is bounded by Kensal Road, Golborne Road, Bosworth Road and the railway. (ii) The London County Council will undertake the redevelopment of 7.2 acres to the east of the Borough Council's present 655. acres. This area is bounded by Golborne Road, Kensal Road and the railway. The London County Council will also be responsible for redeveloping a small area of 0.41 acres between Kensal Road and the canal, to the west of an area in Paddington of 3.6 acres which the County Council now propose to zone as open space in place of the open space of 3.6 acres originally proposed at the eastern end of the area. The London County Council will be responsible for school extensions and the provision of additional open space north of the canal. There is one point of difference outstanding which relates to the question of the density to be adopted in rebuilding: the Council desire to increase the standard proposed by the London Covinty Council, and on this point have lodged an objection with the Minister of Housing and 5 Local Government. The question of maintaining suitable living standards in tenement houses received special consideration by the Council, particularly in regard to a group of houses (Powis Terrace) in the district of North Kensington. The conditions in these properties were unsatisfactory because of the excessive use of the rooms for habitation and the mis.use of those parts of the property used in common by members of more than one family. The relevant sections (No.36 and 90) of the Housing Act, 1957, which were passed to deal with this type of property, have proved ineffective. The Council decided the legislation needed amendment so as to restore those powers which the Council had under Byelaws for Houses Let in Lodgings, (which had been repealed by the Housing Acts in 1954). Representations were made to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee and a deputation from this Council was received by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. It is gratifying to report that the Council's action has met with almost complete success in so far as the Minister subsequently promoted a new Housing Bill which, if passed by Parliament, will restore to a large extent the Council's powers to deal with tenement houses. During 1960 there occurred a severe flooding, due to heavy rainstorms, in certain parts of North Kensington which resulted in many hundreds of basements being affected by the back flow of sewers and excessive surface water. An account of this flooding is given in the body of this report, but it is satisfactory to record that as a result of the urgent consultations and investigations, by both the Council and the London County Council, schemes for improving the sewer system in the borough are now being tackled in an energetic way. The cost of these schemes will run into millions of pounds, but it will be money well worth spending if it will prevent a repetition of the damage, discomfort and distress suffered by many Kensington residents. Clean Air Act. The work of fulfilling the fifteen.year programme laid down by the Council to make the borough "smokeless" was proceeded with energetically during the year. The Order relating to the Holland Ward No.3 Smoke Control Area was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on 24th February and came into operation on 1st October, and the Order relating to the Holland Ward No.2 Smoke Control Area (against which objections were made by five ratepayers) was confirmed by the Minister, after a public enquiry on 22nd July, 1960. This Order will come into operation on 1st October, 1961. Also during the year the Council made an Order in respect of the Pembridge Ward No.l Smoke Control Area comprising approximately 110 acres, and containing 2,517 dwellings and 342 other premises. This Order was confirmed by the Minister on 22nd November, 1960 and will come into operation on 1st October, 1961. The remainder of the Pembridge Ward is at the moment being surveyed and it is anticipated that an Order will be made by the Council very shortly. Thus, the Council's fifteen.year programme is being dealt with in accordance with the scheduled times. Apart from the five isolated objections received in respect of the Holland Ward No.2 area, which resulted in a twelve months' delay, the residents of Kensington, both owners and occupiers, appear to be welcoming the Council's efforts to reduce atmospheric pollution. The work is of a detailed nature and necessitates numerous inspections to ensure that contraventions of the Clean Air Act will not occur, but generally speaking, the initial difficulties in operating this legislation have been overcome and there is no reason why the work should not proceed quickly and smoothly to its finality in 1973• 6 Food Hygiene. The work of enforcing the requirements of the Pood Hygiene Regulations was continued throughout the year. Food traders and the public are generally striving to maintain a high hygienic standard in connection with the storage, preparation and sale of food. The willingness of most people to co.operate in the task of ensuring clean food becomes more evident as time goes on. Unfortunately, the need for periodical inspections is still an urgent one, as is indicated by the number of informal notices served (25 in 1960) by the public health inspectors for various contraventions of the Hygiene Regulations and the greater need to take Court proceedings against wilful offenders. General. During the year the deputy medical officer of health, Dr. Hastings E.A. Carson, was successful in obtaining the appointment of Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of St. Marylebone. He left the Council's service on 28th August, 1960, and I would like to record here my appreciation of the valuable assistance which he gave to me efficiently and loyally during the four years he worked in Kensington. I would also like to record my pleasure in welcoming my new deputy, Dr. Derek J. Sheerboom, who was formerly the senior assistant medical officer of health for the City of Bristol. Dr. Sheerboom took up his appointment on 1st October, 1960. I regret that during the year the death occurred of Miss Vera Osborne, who had been employed as the accounts clerk in the public health department for nearly twenty years. In addition, there were other changes in the staffing of the department, which tend to affect adversely its smooth working. To overcome the shortage of public health inspectors, the Council agreed to permit the existing officers to use their own cars on official work on a "casual.user" basis, and have also increased the staff by the appointment of unqualified assistants to help the inspectors. The Council's scheme for training students as public health inspectors received its first reward during 1960, when one of the students successfully qualified and was immediately appointed to the permanent staff of public health inspectors. It is hoped that further benefit will be derived from the training scheme in the next twelve months. VITAL STATISTICS The table set out on pages 8 and 9 gives the important vital statistics for 1960, together with comparative figures for the previous seven years.

Samples of water were taken both by the Council and the owners for bacteriological and chemical examination. Results showed that the waters were suitable for drinking and other domestic purposes.

The Council afford facilities to persons desirous of sending clothing abroad, but make a charge of 2/6d. for each certificate provided. During the year, 155 parcels of clothing were disinfected and the income amounted to £19. 7s. 6d. The following table indicates the destination of these parcels No. of parcels Czechoslovakia 101 Spain. 47 Hungary 1 Rumania 4 Turkey 1 Canary Islands 1 TOTAL 155 Some other countries allow the import of clothing if accompanied by a certificate stating that no case of infectious disease has occurred at the sender's address within twenty-one days prior to mailing. During the year 38 such certificates were issued. H.C.N, (hydrogen cyanide) Disinfestation With the manufacture and sale for general use of effective insecticides, such as D.D.T., there has been a considerable reduction in the number of infested houses in the borough. The Council have, therefore, discontinued their policy of treating with H.C.N, the furniture of all incoming tenants of new flats irrespective of whether there was evidence of infestation or not. The present scheme provides for the Council's Chief Housing Officer to notify the Medical Officer of Health, in advance, of the names and addresses of prospective tenants, and inspections of the furniture and effects at the old homes are made by a public health inspector. If infestation is found, the contents of the home are collected by the Council's staff, disinfested at Wood Lane with H.C.N, and then taken to the new flat. If no infestation is found, the prospective tenant is allowed to move in directly to the new flat. In all cases, the walls and ducts of the new flats are treated with Gammexane smoke generators (B.H.C.) as a preventive measure. During 19&0, 106 new flats and 11 converted properties became ready for occupation. In 9 cases the furniture of families selected to move into these Council flats (or conversions) was found to be infested and was treated with H.C.N, at the disinfecting station. 13 COMBINED DISINFECTING STATION AND MEDICINAL BATHS During the year the Council considered a proposal to combine the disinfecting service with the personal cleansing service in a new building. The disinfecting station at Wood Lane was built and equipped in 1906 and the original equipment then installed is still in use today. Additions were made in 1934, when a hydrogen cyanide gas unit was added for dealing with bug infested furniture, and in 1940, when an additional disinfector was installed. In 1940 the station was severely damaged by enemy action, when practically the whole of one side of the building was destroyed. The other side also received severe damage, so much so that if it is to remain on its existing site, there is no doubt that the greater part of the building will have to be demolished to its foundation and re— built. In view of this, only "first aid" and temporary repairs, with a minimum of decoration, have been undertaken during the past twenty years. Disinfection and disinfestation of infected and infested articles are best performed in a single building as part of a wider service which includes the cleansing of persons and the treatment of scabies. In many London boroughs this is the case, for such an arrange— ment enables both services to be carried out with economy and allows for an interchangeability of duties amongst the staff. The Borough Engineer prepared a scheme to combine the dis— infecting station and the medicinal baths on a site adjoining the public baths in Lancaster Road. The scheme is for a single-storey building with vehicular access from Blechynden Mews and pedestrian access, both for the staff and the public, on the Silchester Road frontage. Provision is being made for one disinfector at Wood Lane, and for the disinfector in the medicinal baths to be re-used. The drying tumbler recently bought for Wood Lane will also be refixed. The rest of the laundry equipment will be new and will consist of a steam-heated ironing machine, two washing machines, one hydro-extractor and three hair driers. The estimated cost is £34,368. This includes the acquisition of premises, but does not include a credit for the converted value payment for the war-damaged disinfecting station which is likely to be about £6,390; nor does it take into account the substantial value of the present site at Wood Lane depot occupied by the disinfecting and disinfestation buildings. There would also be savings on staff and services estimated at £1,400 per annum, as a result of combining the two services. The scheme has been approved by the Council and it is hoped that the new building will be in use early in 1962. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, imposes a duty on occupiers of premises to notify the Council of rodent infestation, and the Council are required to ensure that the borough is, as far as practicable, kept free from rats and mice. The Council deal with rat and mice infestation in dwelling houses without cost to the occupiers, but expenditure incurred in treating infestations on commercial and industrial premises is recovered from the owners. The Council are required to submit reports on (i) the extent of infestation, (ii) special circumstances to which any undue presence of rats and mice might be attributed, and (iii) the nature and extent of co-operative working with contiguous local authorities. 14 The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food requested a report for the twelve months ended 31st December, 1960 in the following form:- Prevalence of Rats and Mice Type of Property Local Authority Dwelling Houses All other (including Business & Industrial) Total  I.

This work had, up to 1957, been carried out in January and June each year, coinciding with similar treatments carried out in neighbouring boroughs. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recommended in 1957 that a new system of treatment should be introduced, which involved changing the times of baiting to April and September each year, allowing a longer period of time during which baits were left in the sewers, and mixing a mould inhibitor (paranitrophenol) with the baiting material to act as a preservative. The following table shows the results obtained during the year, compared with the results obtained in the nrevious six vears:- Year Estimated number of rats killed 1st Treatment 2nd Treatment 1954 4,142 4,667 1955 4,515 3,430 1956 4,764 4,138 1957 4,476 (January) 7,751 (April) 7,044 (September) 1958 4,945 6,617 1959 6,211 8,082 1960 10,414 5,416 The rodent staff deal with infestations from pests other than rats and mice, and the following is a summary of all action taken during the year:- Premises inspected following complaints 1,385 Premises where rats were found 387 Premises where mice were found 596 Premises where other vermin were found 163 Premises where no infestation existed 239 Number of visits made 7,617 Number of notices served 18 Number of successful treatments 1,356 Cases in which advice only was given 65 Borough Council properties dealt with 53 PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 At the end of the year the number of sellers of Part II Poisons (other than registered pharmacists) on the list maintained by the Council was 123• Of this number 3 were new registrations during the year. One sample of disinfectant was examined under the provisions of this Act, and was reported not to contain poisons within the meaning of the Act. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 This Act regulates the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined. Subject to certain exceptions, the Act makes it unlawful to use prescribed filling materials except on premises registered by a local authority. The exceptions are in the remaking and reconditioning of any article or upholstering in connection with the making of railway carriages, road vehicles, ships or aircraft. The local authority are required, on the application of the occupier of premises, to register the premises on payment of a registration fee of one pound. At the end of the year, there were 19 registered premises in the borough. 16 The Act further provides that no rag flock shall be delivered to registered premises except from premises licensed for manufacturing rag flock or used as a store for rag flock. A local authority on receiving from the occupier of premises an application for the grant or renewal of an annual licence authorising him to manufacture rag flock or to use his premises as a rag flock store, may grant or renew the licence on payment of a fee of one pound. No licences have been issued in Kensington. If on registered premises there are unclean filling materials, the occupier shall be guilty of an offence; and it is also an offence to sell or offer for sale any article which is upholstered with unclean filling materials (second-hand articles are excepted). Inspections of the registered premises were made during the year, and 5 samples of rag flock and other fillings were taken for analysis. The results were satisfactory. Inspections of the registered premises were made during the year, and 5 samples of rag flock and other fillings were taken for analysis. The results were satisfactory. Description No. of samples taken Coir fibre 2 Cotton felt 2 Woollen mixture felt 1 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act requires that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence issued by the Council and in compliance with any conditions specified in the licence. During the year, 8 premises were licensed under the Act. The general conditions for pet shops approved by the Council are those recommended for their constituent councils by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee. HEALTH EDUCATION Health education is an important activity of both central and local authorities and forms an integral part of the National Health Service. For many years the Council have made an annual grant to the Central Council for Health Education, which is the body recognised by the Minister of Health as the medium through which health education material is distributed throughout England and Wales. For the year 1960/61, the Council made a grant of £23, Os. Od. Good use was made of the services available, and posters, leaflets and other material (including copies of Better Health) were obtained from the Central Council for Health Education for use in Kensington. The Borough Librarian and his staff readily co-operated with the public health department during the year in distributing health education bookmarks to members of the public using the Council's lending libraries. At the beginning of the year, there were nine ex-Empire Marketing Boards still in existence. Three were replaced in 1960 by smaller modern boards supported by metal frames of modern design, each capable of displaying four double-crown posters (size 30" x 20"); and three more were to be replaced before the end of the financial year I960/6I. For the time being, the remaining three ex-Empire Marketing Boards, which are fixed to walls, are being retained. 17 In addition, the public health department has the use of a single poster site which has been made available by the London Transport Executive in the subway of the Notting Hill Gate Underground Station. Posters dealing with a variety of health topics were dis— played at regular intervals on the poster frames in the borough. CANCER EDUCATION During the summer, the London County Council produced, in consultation with the Borough Medical Officers, a leaflet drawing attention to the association of cigarette smoking with lung cancer. Ten thousand copies of the leaflet were obtained and were distributed through the public libraries and other borough council channelso MENTAL HEALTH WEEK The Minister of Health drew the attention of local health and hospital authorities to the fact that 1960 had been designated World Mental Health Year with the object of publicising and stimulat— ing activity in all matters relating to mental health. The London County Council decided to participate in Mental Health Week which took place from 9th - 16th July, and asked if this Council would help with publicity. Coloured information wall sheets (size JO" x 20") showing the essential elements of a comprehensive Mental Health Service were received together with a supply of leaflets which reproduced this information. The posters were displayed and the leaflets were made available in the Kensington libraries and offices to which the public had access. HOME SAFETY The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1957 , enables a Metropolitan Borough Council to make arrangements for the dissemination of information and advice for the purpose of promoting safety in the home. In previous years, National Home Safety Campaigns have had as their themes "Guard that Fire" and "Check that Fall". In 1960, the Public Health Committee supported the London County Council's "Safety in the Home Week" campaign which was held during the week 31st October to 5th November; also a nation wide campaign organised by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents against the risk of accidental poisoningo The opportunity was taken of reminding the public of the dangers of falls in the home and of the need to "Guard that Fire"o Posters and leaflets were distributed to approximately 130 organisations in the borough - youth clubs, old people's clubs, large business houses, industrial concerns, voluntary organisations, hospitals, etc. Poster displays were arranged at Council offices and other buildings. Leaflets were made available to the public visiting the Council's offices, and bookmarks were issued through the libraries. Letters, together with suitable posters and leaflets, were sent to 70 chemists and 122 persons in the borough who are registered to sell poisons listed in Part II of the Poisons List, asking for their help by displaying the posters and in making the leaflets available to the public. Most of the material used was obtained without charge from the London County Council, but some posters were purchased from the Central Council for Health Education and the Royal Society for the 18 Prevention of Accidents. The following table shows the amount of publicity material which was obtained and distributed during the year by the Kensington public health department:. Leaflets 17,000 Bookmarks 10,000 Special window labels 570 Posters (30" x 20") 540 HEALTH HANDBOOK During the year, the Council approved the issue of a "Health and Social Services" Handbook for the use of official and voluntary bodies and members of the general public in Kensington. The book was printed by a commercial firm who agreed to supply to the Council two thousand copies free of charge. One thousand five hundred copies were received by the Council in 1960, and the remaining five hundred copies will be made available in the summer of 1961. When the handbooks were distributed, an advisory leaflet giving information of the services to old people and a list of addresses of government departments, voluntary organisations, etc. in the borough, were included with each book. Copies of the handbook were sent to all members of the Council, local Members of Parliament and the London County Council, hospitals, general practitioners, dentists, chemists, clergy, child welfare centres, day nurseries, old people's clubs, etc. Ratepayers applying at the Town Hall (information Office), Public Health Department or the Citizens' Advice Bureau were also supplied with a free copy. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952 This Act makes it an offence to sell any gas or electric fire, or oil heater, suitable for use in residential premises, unless it is fitted with an adequate guard* Generally speaking, traders do not commit offences under this Act, but it has been found necessary to keep a careful watch on the sale of second.hand appliances from stalls in public markets. On two occasions during the year offences by street traders were reported to the Public Health Committee,. In one case a warning was issued and in the other case legal proceedings were instituted and the defendant was given a conditional discharge on payment of 10/6d. costs„ MASS RADIOGRAPHY Mass radiography is undertaken on behalf of the Minister of Health by the Regional Hospital Boards, Kensington is included in the area covered by the Mass X.ray Unit No.5A operated by the North— west Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. The purpose of mass radiography is twofold:. (i) to find abnormalities of the chest and in particular tuberculosis and cancer of the lungs, and (ii) to give those whose X.ray is within "normal limit" a certain degree of security. 19 Details of persons X-rayed by the Unit during surveys in Kensington in 1960 are as follows Organised Groups No. X-rayed  Richard Shops, Kensington High Street 156 Queen Elizabeth College 352 North Kensington Henry Dickens Court 96 Kensington Temple, Notting Hill 332 Portobello Court 193 Allom and Barlow House 82 Treverton Estate 105 Octavia House 133 Bramley House 120 Council Depot, Warwick Road 226 N.T.G.B. Kensal Depot 292 GRAND TOTAL: 2,087 A provisional analysis of the surveys revealed 4 cases of active tuberculosis, 2 cases where it is necessary to keep the patient under observation, and 2 cases of lung cancer. THE GENERAL DRAINAGE AND SEWER SYSTEM The drainage system in the Metropolitan Boroughs is a combined one whereby surface water and foul water both enter the same sewers. In most cases houses are connected direct to borough council sewers and these, in turn, discharge into the London County Council main sewers. In a few cases, where local sewers do not exist, house connections are taken direct into the main sewers. Flooding of Basements On the afternoon of Sunday, 7th August, 1960, a severe rain storm occurred in London and south east England. The Counties of London, Surrey and Middlesex were par— ticularly involved, especially the Boroughs of Tottenham, Willesden, Chiswick and Acton, and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Battersea, Hammersmith, Fulham, Westminster, Chelsea and Kensington. In these areas, basements were flooded, roads blocked by water, underground railway and trolleybus services disrupted, and telephone services put out of action. The Meteorological Office recorded 1.36 inches of rain at Kensington Palace and most of this fell between 2.30 and 4.00 p.m. Kensington basements were particularly affected; the flooding being more severe and widespread than in previous flooding incidents. The four Fire Stations serving the Kensington area dealt with 578 flood distress calls as compared with 827 for the whole of the London County Council area for the period 7th - 8th August. The abnormal rainfall resulted in a surcharging of sewers and drains, which were inadequate to cope with the volume of fluid, with the result that sewage under pressure "backed up" gullies, interceptors and traps, forced off manhole covers and. flooded "areas", basement rooms, cellars and passages frequently to a depth of 2'6" and, in some cases, as high as 5 feet. In consequence floor coverings, furniture, furnishings and bedding were wholly or partly submerged in foul smelling sewage. A complicating factor was the presence of large amounts of rubbish and junk which, in the absence of free collection and disposal, tenants had stored in dis— used basement rooms. When the sewage receded or was removed it left behind foul smelling filthy residue which contained all the bowel germs usually found in sewage, potentially capable of conveying 20 such diseases as typhoid, paratyphoid, gastro-enteritis, dysentery, poliomyelitis and food poisoning. In order to ascertain the extent of the flooding, public health inspectors and assistants were instructed to make an initial survey of the known flood areas and to telephone the department as soon as practicable as to the position, Prom these preliminary reports it was clear that the flooding had been both widespread and severe, affecting hundreds of basements in the borough. Areas affected included the western end of the Holland Ward, large areas of the Norland Ward, a small area in the south-western part of St. Charles Ward, parts of the Pembridge Ward, parts of Queen's Gate and the eastern half of the Redcliffe Wardu The worst cases appeared to be in the Norland and Pembridge Wards of the borough, particularly in Arundel Gardens, Elgin Crescent, Talbot Grove, Lancaster Road and Blechynden Street. The Public Wash-houses and Disinfecting Station were made available for the hosing and drying of affected material and Council's transport and personnel were used for collecting damaged bedding, carpets, clothing, etc. Pour vehicles, together with their teams, were placed at the disposal of the public health department, and an inspector was allocated to each vehicle. A record was made of all articles collected and each article was labelled with the name and address of the owner. In addition disinfecting fluid was obtained for distribution free of charge to residents. The work of helping the people affected by the flooding extended until the following day, by the end of which all known cases of flooding damage had been dealt with. At the height of the flooding a number of "homeless" people assembled at Ladbroke Road Police Station and immediate assistance was given by the Women's Voluntary Services and the Council's Civil Defence Service. The London County Council provided accommodation for the night in the Newington Lodge Hostel to which people were transported by coach. The Vicar of St. Mark's Church also offered accommodation in the Church Hall, and two people made use of this offer. Officers of the Council (including Civil Defence personnel), representatives of the police, the London County Council, the National Assistance Board and the Women's Voluntary Services were in constant consultation during and after the incident on the execution of remedial measures. On the afternoon of Thursday, 1st September, a further heavy rain storm occurred, 1.51 inches of rain being recorded at Kensington Palace for the period 1st - 2nd September. On this occasion, however, the rainfall was continuous over most of the 24hour period and not so concentrated into such a short time as in the previous incident. Although fairly widespread flooding of basements did occur, much less damage was caused. The levels of sewage flooding were substantially lower, being commonly 2/3 inches with occasionally levels of 2'6". Broadly speaking, it was limited to areas, passages, cellars and entrances,rather than the living rooms so much affected on the earlier occasion. Fewer calls for assistance were received (the Pire Stations concerned dealt with 147 calls as compared with 178 for the London County Council area), no family was rendered homeless, and a much smaller quantity of bedding and floor coverings had to be collected and dried. It was not necessary to close the Public Wash-houses on this occasion, and most of the drying was carried out at the Wood Lane Disinfecting Station. Only one refuse vehicle had to be brought into service for collecting. Following this flooding, consultations took place between the Council and the London County Council to consider what steps might be taken to prevent further damage by storm flooding. The 21 problem was essentially a technical one, affecting the general drainage and sewer systems, and a great deal of study had to be given to it. As a result of these investigations it has been concluded that it will be impossible to provide a sewerage system which would guarantee complete immunity from flooding under all conditions and that a storm of less intensity than those which occurred in 1960 should be selected to form a practicable basis for relief sewer design. It is evident from the surveys made that the County Council's Counters Creek main sewer and some of the local sewers will have to be relieved. The London County Council's main sewers are capable of taking a rainfall intensity of one.quarter of an inch an hour over the whole of their West London drainage area, and they propose to increase this capacity by fifty per cent. This rate will also cover storms of higher intensities over parts of the total area, e.g., an intensity of one and seven.eighths inches per hour over an area of one thousand acres. To match the main sewer proposals of the County Council, the Borough Council's local sewers draining to Counters Creek, north of Kensington High Street, should be made capable of taking a rainfall of one.and.a.half inches per hour without surcharge. This means that the Council will have to increase some of the existing sewer capacities very considerably by constructing relief sewers, and provided this is done a greater degree of protection against flooding will result except in about four hundred and thirty cases where houses have basement floor levels either below or less than one foot above the crown of the sewers. The drainage of North Kensington is mainly taken into the Counters Creek main sewer and there are forty.six separate catchment areas within the borough draining into the section north of Kensington High Street. The Council's sewers are large enough to prevent flooding in forty.three of these areas if the intensity of storm does not exceed the standard being adopted by the London County Council for design purposes and provided the basements are not lower than one foot above the soffit of the sewer. The following three areas are principally subject to flooding, vizs. (i) The area covering Bomore Road, the western section of Lancaster Road, Blenheim Crescent west of Ladbroke Grove and Lansdowne Road north of Lansdowne Rise, which includes most of the Pembridge Ward. This area drains into the Counters Creek sewer at Lancaster Road and also takes some drainage from Paddington in the Westbourne Park railway area. The Borough Council's sewer should be relieved of a large part of its storm water near the junction of Elgin Crescent with Kensington Park Road and again near Bomore Road. (ii) The area covering most of the northern portion of the Norland Ward and about one.third of the St. Charles Ward (south.eastern section). This area drains into the Counters Creek sewer near Henry Dickens Court. The Borough Council's sewer should be relieved near the junction of St. Mark's Road with Cornwall Crescent and later it can be combined with the relief sewer from area (i) suitably enlarged to take the additional flow. (iii) The area covering the central portion of the Holland Ward and parts of the southern section of the Norland and Pembridge Wards. The Council's sewer meets the Counters Creek sewer near Royal Crescent and requires relief at a point near Holland Park Avenue/Norland Square junction. - 22 - There are two other areas in the Golborne Ward and in the Holland Ward where investigations have not yet been completed. A preliminary estimate for providing sewers to relieve the three principal areas is of the order of £350,000. This estimate can only be regarded as a very tentative figure at this stage, for it may be necessary to divert plant belonging to the public utility authorities. These sewers will not assist 432 basements with floor levels either below, or less than 1 ft. above, the crown of the sewers. Of these 432 basements, 372 could be made reasonably immune from sewer flooding if they were provided with anti-flooding devices. The London County Council estimate that the average cost of doing this would be between £150 and £250 per house. There is no practical cure for the remaining 60 basements, which must be regarded as "undrainable". The County Council suggest that legislation should be promoted by a clause in a General Powers Bill, on a request from the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, to enable metropolitan borough councils:- (i) require owners of undrainable premises, which can be made suitable for residential purposes by the execution of minor works to protect them from flooding, to carry out such works as may be prescribed; and to carry out such works in default of the owners; and (ii) require the drains in undrainable premises which cannot be made suitable for residential purposes to be sealed off, and the use of such basements for residential purposes discontinued. The County Council suggested that the cost of the minor works referred to in (i) should be shared between the owner and public funds, say, in equal proportions, and that the question of the actual proportion, and which authority is to be responsible for rehousing families displaced as the result of any action taken under (ii), should be matters for consultation between the County Council and the Standing Joint Committee. The Council agreed that legislation on the lines suggested by the London County Council should be promoted without delay, but considered that the power of the local authority to contribute towards the cost of the works referred to in (i) above should be permissive and not mandatory. They were also of opinion that the proposals do not go far enough, because the upper parts of premises with closed basements will remain in use, and any inlets to the drain serving these upper parts should be raised to ground level. There should be a requirement that, when the basements are closed and the drain sealed, work should be carried out to ensure that they will not become damp and derelict. Whilst it is a serious reflection that parts of Kensington have been subject to flooding during heavy rain storms for many years, it is a matter of satisfaction to be able to report that urgent steps are being taken to prevent, as far as practicable, a repetition of these events. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Clean Air Act, 1956. Certain provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956, which received Royal Assent on 5th July, 1956, came into force on 31st December, 1956, and the remaining provisions came into operation on 1st June, 1958• -23- Smoke Control Areas. Sections 11 to 15 of the Act relate to the functions of the Council to declare smoke control areas, in which the emission of smoke from the chimney of any building would be an offence. The procedure for establishing a smoke control area is laid down by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and comprises four main phases, as follows:- (a) Having decided in principle on the location, size, area and types of property to be included in the area, the Council must give provisional notice of their proposals to the Minister. (b) Upon receipt of the Minister's approval to the provisional plan, a detailed survey of the area must be made. (c) When the survey has been completed, the Council may make the Order and submit it to the Minister for confirmation. (d) After the Minister's confirmation, enforcement action is carried out to bring the Order into operation. This stage includes the conversion of firegrates, the payment of grants, and the necessary action to secure Exchequer contributions. In 1959 the Minister of Housing and Local Government requested local authorities, especially in "black areas", to prepare a phased fiveyear programme for establishing smoke control areas. The Council adopted the following programme:- Smoke Control Area Boundaries Preliminary Survey Detailed Survey & Order made Order operative Holland Ward (No.l) N. S. E. W.

The Order was eventually confirmed by the Minister who fixed 1st October, 196I as the date on which it will come into operation. No objections were received in respect of the other two areas. On 26th July, 1960 the Council made a Smoke Control Order in respect of the Pembridge No.l area which is that part of the Pembridge Ward south of Westbourne Grove and Ladbroke Gardens. It is bounded on the north by the middle of Westbourne Grove and Ladbroke Gardens, on the east - 25 - by the borough boundary, on the south by the middle of Notting Hill Gate and Holland Park Avenue, and on the west by the middle of Ladbroke Grove. The survey of this area showed that the total cost of adaptations will be about £9,272. Os. Od., of which, after deducting Exchequer grant, the owners (or occupiers) and the Council will each be liable for £2,782. Os. Od. The Council recommended that the Order for this area should operate from 1st October, 1961, and the Minister gave his approval on 22nd November, 1960. Further, on 26th July, 1960 the Council submitted for approval, to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, a proposal that the remainder of the Pembridge Ward should be made the subject of a Smoke Control Order. This part of the Ward is bounded on the north by the middle of Lancaster Road, on the east by the borough boundary, on the south by the middle of Westbourne Grove and Ladbroke Gardens, and on the west by the middle of Ladbroke Grove. It has an area of about 83 acres, and it was estimated that the total cost of adaptations will be about £22,500. 0s. 0d. The Minister subsequently gave his provisional approval to this proposal. Circular No.28/60 was issued by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government giving guidance to local authorities on the question of the use of sticks and paper for lighting fires in smoke control areas. The Circular stated that where no supply of town gas is available, it is likely that occupiers of houses will require to use sticks and paper for lighting fires. The Circular stated that legal cover for this could best be given by the use in smoke control orders of the power of exemption provided in the Act. The Minister asked local authorities to consider giving exemptions in general terms to fireplaces in any building in a smoke control area which is not supplied with town gas and the Council decided, on 11th October, 1960 to comply with the Minister's request when recommending future smoke control orders. New furnaces. Section 3 requires that new furnaces, not used mainly for domestic purposes and exceeding a specified capacity, shall be so far as is practicable smokeless. Any person installing such a furnace must give prior notice to the Council and may submit detailed plans and specifications for approval before the work of installation takes place. During 1960, 16 notifications were received, and 2 appli¬cations for approval of plans, etc., were approved. In one instance it was reported that a new furnace had been installed in a building without proper notice being given to the Council, and the Public Health Committee decided to issue a warning in this case. Smoke emissions. The Sections of the Clean Air Act, 1956 which relate to industrial smoke came into force on 1st June, 1958. Up to that date emissions of industrial smoke were dealt with under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions mainly affecting the Council are contained in Section 1, which prohibits the emission of dark smoke (except for certain periods laid down by regulation) and Section 16 which deals with smoke nuisances. During the year 21 complaints of smoke nuisance were received and 32 formal smoke observations were carried out. In one case an offence against Section 1 of the Clean Air Act, 1956 was observed; an intimation notice was served, and the Public Health Committee issued a warning to the occupier. Remedial measures in all cases were secured without further proceedings. - 26 - Routine measurement of atmospheric pollution. The Council maintain two atmospheric pollution measuring stations as follows:- (1) North Kensington (St. Joseph's Convent, Portobello Road) (2) South Kensington (Messrs. John Barker's Furniture Depository, Pembroke Road) The apparatus at each station consists of a standard deposit gauge for collecting soluble and insoluble deposits, and a lead peroxide apparatus for measuring the sulphur content of the air. Readings are taken at each station at the end of each month. In addition to the above mentioned stations, the Council have established three smoke measuring stations as follows (1) Public Health Department, Hornton Street, W.8. (2) Public Library, Ladbroke Grove, W.10. (3) L.C.C. Child Welfare Centre, Redcliffe Street, S.W.10. The equipment at the public health department consists of a smoke filter and a hydrogen peroxide bubbling apparatus. The smoke filter measures the daily concentration of smoke suspended in the atmosphere, and the hydrogen peroxide bubbler extracts the sulphur dioxide content of the atmosphere. Readings are taken each day, and the results are averaged to produce figures for each calender month. The equipment at the public library and the welfare centre consists of smoke filters only. Measurements are taken three times a week, and daily and monthly averages are calculated from the results.

In this connection it is a matter of interest that the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research requested the Council to use a Reflectometer for measuring the amount of atmospheric pollution recorded by the filter papers at the three smoke measuring stations maintained in the borough by the Council. This instrument enables greater accuracy to be obtained and eliminates the possibility of human error. The Council agreed to purchase a Reflectometer for this work and the instrument is now in daily use in the department. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT, I960 This Act came into operation on 27th November, 1960. Under Section 1 any noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law is deemed to be a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. In London, Section 66 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937 has for many years given Metropolitan Borough Councils power to deal with noise as a nuisance under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, where a person made or caused to be made or continued an excessive or unreasonable or unnecessary noise which was injurious or dangerous to health. The Noise Abatement Act, i960 amended this Section to conform with the new meaning of noise nuisance. Local authorities are now able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance (not necessarily injurious or dangerous to health) by the service of an abatement Notice on the person causing the nuisance and, if the Notice is not complied with, it can be enforced by proceedings in a Magistrate's Court. Apart from action by a local authority, any three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make complaint direct to a Magistrate. Complaints are received in the department from time to time regarding noise nuisances, mainly arising as a result of industrial work. In all cases, during i960, remedies were secured without recourse to legal action. It should be noted that, in the case of noise or vibration caused in the course of a trade or business, it is a defence in any proceedings to show that the best practicable means have been used for preventing it and counteracting its effect. PUBLIC BATHS The Minister of Health (Circular l/60) has requested that reference should be made to any public swimming baths in the borough. The Council have provided indoor swimming pools at the Public Baths situated in North Kensington at the junction of Lancaster Road and Silchester Road. The original building was constructed about seventy years ago and no major structural alterations have since taken place. However, the facilities available for the public are maintained in as modern a standard as possible. - 30 - The swimming pools are described as follows 1. 1st Class Swimming Pool (used for mixed bathing). 2o Men's 2nd Class Swimming Pool. 3. Ladies' 1st Class Swimming Pool. 4. Ladies' 2nd Class Swimming Pool. The 1 surge mixed bathing pool has an area of approximately 4?500 sq0 ft. and the other three have each an area of about 1,500 sq. ft. All the pools are available for swimming in the summer months (mid-April to mid-October), but during the winter months only one of the smaller pools is open to the public for swimming. The water used for swimming is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board's supply at the commencement of the bathing season, and throughout the season it is treated by a continuous filtration system. Low pressure sand filters were installed in 1927 and a continuous chlorination equipment added several years later. This plant is now worn out and new equipment embodying the latest improvements is being substituted. The work of replacing the filtration plant for the large swimming pool and ladies' first class pool was carried out during the winter of 1959/60 and completed on 2nd May, i960. The filtration process consists of drawing water from the deep end of the cool through a suitable strainer and, after the addition of coagulants to flocculate organic matter and to obtain efficient filtration, the water is pumped to the top of four Vertical Air-Scoured Pressure Filters. The water, before filtration, is sterilized; this is done by introducing chlorinated water into the circulating flow from "Wallace & Tiernan" Automatic Residual Chlorine Control equipment, with hydraulic solution feeder for automatic pH Control. This gives an accurate method of controlling the dosage. The chlorinator automatically injects water chlorinated to the correct strength and at the same time adjusts the doses to suit varying bathing loads. The amount of chlorination provided operates on the principle of "breakpoint chlorination" and is recorded on a chart from which the degree of sterilization of the water is known at any time during the swimming season. The filter units consist of vertical closed cylinders containing graded Non-Friable Leighton Buzzard Sand supported on a bed of graded granite chippings, through which the water passes at a rate of 230-gallons per square foot of filter area per hour. The sand has to be washed regularly - this is done by steam and air agitation and reversing the flow of water, which runs to waste and carries impurities with it. Water taken from the pools is used for the washing process. The filtered water is then aerated, thereby assisting in the maintenance of bacterial purity. It is then heated by calorifiers to about 75°F« It re-enters the swimming pools through suitable inlets at the shallow ends. Scum troughs are being provided on the sides of the pools which draw off any pollution which may accumulate near the surface, together with any dust which settles thereon. The new equipment has been designed to give a turnover period up to 5^" hours, which is about twice that obtained from the old plant. By this means, quicker purification of water is obtained and is particularly beneficial during peak periods. - 31 - The whole of the new equipment has been designed to comply with the latest recommendations of the Ministry of Health for indoor swimming pools. Samples of water in the pools are taken from time to time, and during i960 the results obtained were well within the bacteriological standards recommended by the Ministry of Health. The residual chlorine similarly was maintained within the concentration advocated. PUBLIC MORTUARY For many years, the Council maintained a public mortuary at No.lA, Hornton Place, W.8. Prom 15th April, 1958> the Coroner decided that all bodies of persons dying within Kensington coming under his jurisdiction should be taken to the Hammersmith Mortuary, which adjoins the West London Coroner's Court. Consequently, the Council decided to close their premises and made an arrangement with the Hammersmith Borough Council that all Kensington cases should be accommodated in the Hammersmith Mortuary. The agreement provides that an annual payment of £500 shall be made for this service. Details regarding the number of Kensington cases admitted during i960 to the Hammersmith Public Mortuary in accordance with the agreement are as follows By Order of Coroner 387 By Order of Police 2 On application of Undertaker 2 391 No. of Post mortem examinations made 389 No. of inquests held 89 BURIAL OF THE DEAD Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, imposes on the Council the duty to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies, or is found dead, within the borough, where no suitable private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. The Council have authorised the Medical Officer of Health to make arrangements for the burial of any person to whom the Section applies. In the twelve months ended 31st December, i960, the Council became responsible for the burial of 31 persons dying in the borough. The following is a summary the action taken:- (a) Cases where the funeral expenses have been fully recovered 20 (b) Cases where part only of the expenses has been recovered 2 (i) Number of these where balance of expenses will be recovered 1 (amounting to £13. 5s.

Of the thirty-one cases dealt with, fourteen were eligible for Death Grant from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. The total amount recovered from this source amounted to £199* 7s. 6d. (included in the above figures). Since the National Assistance Act came into force on 5th Julj 1948, the Council have arranged for the burial of 465 persons under Section 50. BOROUGH CREMATION SERVICE The Council have an arrangement with the General Cemetery Company who own the Kensal Green Crematorium at the north-west corner of the borough, whereby a reduced charge of five guineas is made for the cremation of Kensington residents, subject to certain financial conditions. In i960, there were 291 Kensington cremations, in comparison with 273 in 1959 and 263 in 1958. These figures compare with only 60 Kensington cremations in 1948 (prior to the arrangement coming into effect). MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS OF STAFF The Medical Officer of Health arranges all medical examinations of staff for the purposes of the Borough Council's Superannuation Scheme. During the year 182 examinations were made. DOG NUISANCES Apart from being an objectionable social offence, fouling of footways by dogs is a public health nuisance for which an adequate remedy is hard to find. While it has been shown that dogs can carry and excrete germs capable of producing illness in man, it is seldom that cases of human disease can positively be related to infections originating from this source. Nevertheless, such instances do occur and the potential risk cannot be ignored. Certainly dog filth is an attraction to flies and blowflies, with consequent possibilities of conveyance of infection. The main objection, however, to the fouling of pavements and grass verges by dog excreta is the nauseating revulsion, embarrassment and distress caused by chance pollution of shoes, clothing, mats and carpets, necessitating disgusting and timeconsuming cleansing operations. - 33 - The Council's byelaw dealing with this nuisance provides that:- "No person being in charge of a dog shall allow the animal to foul the footway of any street or public place by depositing its excrement thereon. For the purposes of this byelaw the owner of the dog shall be deemed to be in charge thereof, unless the Court is satisfied that at the time when the dog fouled the footway it had been placed in or taken into the charge of some other person." During the year four prosecutions were taken under this byelaw. Convictions were secured in three cases and fines amounting to £2. 10s. Od., with £2. 12s. 6d. costs, were imposed. The fourth summons was adjourned sine die. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE The Council have accepted the responsibility, within their powers, for co-ordinating and assisting in the extension of activities for aged persons and to alleviate unsatisfactory conditions under which many old people are living. Co-operation with voluntary bodies interested in the welfare of old people is effected wherever possible. In order that action taken shall be uniform, the Kensington Old People's Welfare Voluntary Committee act as an intermediary between the Council and the voluntary bodies. Four members of the Public Health Committee serve on the Old People's Welfare Voluntary Committee which acts as a co-ordinating non-executive Committee through which voluntary bodies claim assistance from the Council and through which the Council pass requests for executive action. Advice Leaflets The Council arrange for the distribution of copies of a pamphlet giving information of the services available to old people individually or through a club. A further 5>000 copies were printed during the year. S.O.S. Cards Window display cards are provided by the Council, bearing the letters "S.OoS." in red on one side and, on the reverse side, directions how to use the card, with space for particulars of nextof-kin or nearest relative., These cards are distributed to appropriate old people„ Any person seeing one of the cards in a window is able to summon help from one of the sources given on the back of the card. The local press have generously assisted in making this service known. Grants to Club3, etc. Under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948> "the Council can make contributions to voluntary bodies whose activities include the provision of recreation or meals for old people. During the year grants were made as follows:- (a) The Kensington Communal Kitchen Service were granted £500 as a contribution towards the cost of operating a Meals-on-Wheels service in co-operation with the Kensington Women's Voluntary Services, and a further grant not exceeding £45 towards the cost of the hire of "relief" transport. - 34 - (b) The Home from Home Club, Royal Palace Hotel, were granted. £42. 5s. lOd. towards their general running expenses, and a further grant equivalent to 4/- Per day (but not exceeding £30) when the Club was transferred to a room in the British Red Cross Society's Headquarters. (c) The "Nook" Old People's Club were granted £5 for the purchase of games equipment. (d) The West London Old Age Pensioners' Angling Competition Committee were granted £5 towards the cost of their annual competition. (e) The Federation of Old Age Pensioners' Club (North Kensington Branch, Golborne Hall, Golborne Road) were granted £31. 43° Od. for the purchase of 24 additional chairs. Holidays Since April, 1951 > the Council, in co-operation with the Family Welfare Association, have operated a scheme for providing holidays for old people. During the present year a block booking of eighty places was made on the ground and first floors of Lennox House Holiday Home, Southsea, for the months of May and June; and twenty-five places were booked with the Ramsgate and District Hotel and Boarding House Association for the period May to June. In addition one extra place was offered at Lennox House for the month of June and two extra places for the month of October. The terms quoted for Lennox House were £4. 10s. Od. per week, and for Ramsgate £4» 7s• 6d. per week. Private coaches were hired to take the old people to and from these homes and convenient assembly points in the borough were arranged. As in other years, applications for holidays were investigated by the Woman Health Officer, and were then passed to the Family Welfare Association for the holiday arrangements. A sum of five shillings per booking was paid to the Family Welfare Association towards their administration expenses. The following is a summary of the action taken during I96O:- Total number of old people who applied 141 Considered unsuitable on medical grounds 4 Referred to L.C.C. for recuperative holidays 3 Cancellations after applying ... ... Number on waiting list ... 13 20 Number of applications approved by the Chairman 121 Cancellations after approval 13 Number sent on holiday:- To Lennox House, Southsea 83 To Ramsgate 2^ 108 Total 121 - 35 - Cost of holidays £. s. d.

In each case the holiday was for a period of two weeks. Letters of appreciation have been received from the old people concerned and all those participating expressed their utmost satisfaction when seen by the Woman Health Officer on their return home o Institutional and Domiciliary Care of the Aged Sick Facilities for institutional care, home nursing, sick room equipment and home helps are provided by the London County Council. Hospital treatment, medical care, ophthalmic, dental and pharmaceutical services are provided under statute by the Minister of Health. The borough is situated in the area of two Metropolitan Regional Hospital Boards. One Hospital Management Committee in the northern portion of the borough utilizes the part-time service of a local medical practitioner as a clinical assessor to decide the priority need for admission of all patients submitted to that Hospital Group as being in need of hospital treatment and classed as "chronic sick". Cases on the chronic sick waiting lists of St. Mary Abbot's Hospital in the borough are referred to the public health department. They are visited and assessed by the women health officers. This ensures the early or immediate admission of patients where the need is urgent on medico/social grounds. There is usually no difficulty in the admission to hospital for the treatment of acute conditions. Where necessary, medical care, home nursing, home helps, convalescent holidays, financial aid and pensions are arranged with the appropriate statutory bodies <, These, together with various services operated by the Council augmented by voluntary bodies, are provided to such good effect that, in many cases, the need for hospital admission is postponed indefinitely. The number of "chronic sick" visits by the women health officers during the year totalled 438. During the year it was possible to arrange for 99 old people to be admitted to hospitals for institutional treatment and, in addition, 63 cases were admitted to homes for the aged„ Domiciliary Cleansing Arrangements have been made whereby old people's living accommodation and household articles are cleansed and, if necessary, disinfested. Six old people were dealt with in I960. Laundry At present no direct authority exists for the Council to provide a laundry service, as such, for old people. Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, enables the Council to cause any article in the house to be cleansed, disinfected or destroyed, if it is in such a filthy, dangerous or unwholesome condition that health is affected or endangered thereby. The cleansing of grossly fouled bedding in cases of incontinence may be - 36 - dealt with under this Section. To comply with the legal requirements, the Council have given a general authority to the Medical Officer of Health to take whatever action appears to him to be necessary under the terms of Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. In 80 cases action was taken under the Section- The bedding was marked, laundered at the Council's disinfecting station and returned to the old people. The scheme works smoothly and appears to fill a much felt want. From stocks of bedding held, the Council are able to supply linen and bedding on loan to old people while their own is being laundered, and where possible voluntary organisations are asked to undertake replacements of much worn articles. During the year 1,508 separate collections of laundry were made under this scheme, and the number of articles cleansed totalled 17,717- Library Facilities The Libraries Committee co-operate in providing books for old people confined to their homes. The circulation of the books is effected by the Women's Voluntary Services mobile library. Chiropody During the year the London County Council, with the approval of the Minister of Health, extended their functions under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, to include a chiropody service, giving priority to the needs of old people, the physically handicapped and expectant mothers. They undertook to make a grant of £175 "to the Kensington Old People's Welfare Committee for the purpose of enabling the provision of a chiropody service for housebound old people. The Kensington Branch of the British Red Cross Service have accepted responsibility for the complete administration of the service in the borough, and all the patients are referred to them through the public health department. The total number of persons treated under the home chiropody scheme was 281, and the number of treatments given was 600. Meals Service The arrangements for meals either delivered to old people in their homes or in canteens were continued with great success by the Women's Voluntary Services in conjunction with the Kensington Communal Services Committee. The Women's Voluntary Services undertake the work of verifying the bona fides of applicants, arrange delivery of meals at the homes of old people and collect the money (lOd. per meal). The Kensington Communal Services Committee supply the meals and the vehicles for delivery. The two organisations involved have given a considerable amount of thought to the difficulties encountered in this service, amongst which were the problems of keeping the meals hot} serving them (sometimes in the van); keeping the van interior clean; avoiding waste or spillage; and washing up. A solution of these problems was forthcoming, when the idea was devised of developing electric containers which could be used on mains voltage to preheat the food and then, using another circuit, operate off the vehicle batteries to maintain the temperature of the food during its journey. As a result of this, it was decided to - 37 - make container units capable of carrying 20 main meals in expendable foilpak dishes each having a 12-ounce capacity, These dishes which "nest" in quantity are extremely light and have a modest salvage value. Four container units can be plugged into one vehicle. The containers have top and bottom doors so that food can be removed from the top section first and the maximum heat retained in the bottom section. The foilpak dishes are placed five to each of four removable wire cages, each dish being completely separated from its neighbour. At the delivery point, two foilpak dishes containing a complete meal are taken out on a metal dish covered with a close fitting dish cover and carried to the recipient. The system, the first of its kind in this country, possesses the following advantages~ — — (i) space and weight saving; (ii) portability and lightness in handling; (iil) maintenance of temperature; (iv) abolition of washing up, with consequent saving in staff wages; (v) abolition of the necessity for serving meals in the van; (vi) cleanliness and ease of service; (vii) increased speed and efficiency of service; (viii) added convenience and comfort for staff and beneficiaries; (ix) more appetising meals; (x) no breakages of crockery. In operation, it has proved most popular with the old people and the staff. The following statement shows the progress of the servioe and financial effect since the inception of the schemes- Peroid Number of Meals Gross Cost Receipts from old people Subsidy from L.C.C Grant from R.B.K.

During Christmas week a free Christmas dinner, including turkey and ham, was distributed to the old people through donations given by local organisations and private residents. Under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948» the Council have power to make grants to voluntary bodies undertaking the supply of meals to old people and a grant of £510 was made to the Kensington Communal Services Committee for 1960/61. Visiting The Council's women health officers visit old people brought to their notice. A comprehensive record system is kept of old people in the borough including personal particulars, environmental conditions and special needs. The local voluntary organisations supply records of old people whom they help and every endeavour is made to keep this information up to date. The following is a summary of the work carried out by the Council's women health officers in connection with the care of old people during the year 1960s- Cases on register at the beginning of year ... 5»123 New cases added to register... ... ... ... 683 Cases removed to hospital <>.. .. <> ... ... 99 Cases removed to homes (voluntarily) ... ... 60 Cases removed to homes (compulsorily) ... ... 3 Cases removed from district... .. 160 Number of deaths 0.0 o.. ... e.. .00 295 Total number of cases remaining on register at end of year 00. 000 o.o o.» 000 5>189 Number of old people sent away for holiday ... 108 Number of old people provided with Council's laundry service o.e 000 000 *o. 000 80 Number of old people provided with "Meals on Wheels" 200 Cases referred to National Assistance Board ... 175 Cases referred for assistance from Home Help Department 000 000 0.0 o.o .00 ... 169 Cases referred for assistance from Voluntary Organisations oo. 000 0.0 0.0 oo. 98 Cases referred to Recreational Clubs ... ... 209 Number of visits to chronic sick cases 438 Cases assisted with provision of medical and nursing care 00. 000 000 .oo oo. 99 Cases referred to home chiropody service ... 281 Cases where disinfestation was carried out ... 6 Number of initial home visits made ... ... 654 Number of re—visits 000 oo. oo. 000 000 3'412 Number of other visits made in connection with old people, including visits to clubs ... 150 Number of interviews, enquiries, etc. on behalf of old people oo. oo. 000 00. oo. 1,864 Removal of old and infirm persons to institutions, etc. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948> the Council may apply to a Court for an order to remove to a suitable institution any person who - (a) is suffering from grave chronic disease, or being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, is living in insanitary conditions, and - 39 - (b) is unable to devote to himself, or is not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. The National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951> amended Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948» and provided that application for removal of urgent cases may be made by the local authority or by the Medical Officer of Health, if authorised by the Council to do so, without giving seven days* notice as previously required. Such applications may be made either to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction or to a single Justice, on a certificate by the Medical Officer of Health and another registered medical practitioner,, Further, where the hospital or institution agree to receive the case, it is not necessary to give seven days® notice to the manager thereof. Detention Orders made in respect of these urgent cases are limited to three weeks, and if it is necessary to extend this time, compliance must be made with the original requirements of Section 47- Although many cases of old people were investigated during the year, in only two cases was formal action taken to secure compulsory removal to an institution. Details of these cases are as followss- The first was a woman, aged 83 years, living alone in insanitary conditions in one room. She was unable to devote to herself proper care and attention, and she persistently refused all offers of help from domiciliary services. Endeavours made to persuade her to enter a Home voluntarily met with adamant refusals. A Justice's Order was, therefore, obtained and she was removed to a London Covinty Council Home, where she has settled down as a permanent resident . The second was a woman, aged 81 years, living alone in a ground floor flato She sustained an accident, involving a suspected fracture of the left leg, and was taken to hospital„ She refused treatment and took her own discharge and returned by ambulance to her home where she had no one to look after her. The injured limb was very contused and the toes were becoming gangrenous, and it was essential that she should receive medical treatment. When a further effort to remove her to hospital was made she refused to get into the ambulance. A Justice's Order was, therefore, obtained and she was then removed to hospital, where she still occupies a chronic sick bed. No extension of the Order was necessary. It was necessary to take action under the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951 in regard to a third person (not elderly), and the details are as follows:- A woman, aged 33 years, was suffering from a grave chronic disease and living alone in extremely insanitary conditions. She was most unco-operative and it was not possible to arrange domiciliary care under these conditions. She was in urgent need of medical treatment and nursing and, although every effort was made to persuade her to go to hospital, she persistently refused. A Justice's Order was, therefore, obtained and she was admitted to hospital. She subsequently discharged herself at the end of the 21-day period of the Order, but is now accepting proper domiciliary and medical services. - 40 SANITARY INSPECTION The following table shows a summary of the inspections, etc. carried, out by the public health inspectors and their assistants during the year:- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Houses inspected on complaint 2,631 Houses inspected after infectious disease 1,901 Re-inspections 6,956 Smoke observations 47 Other inspections 1,679 Housing Act, 1957 Initial inspections of dwelling houses 176 Re—inspections 344 Initial inspections for overcrowding 366 Re*"inspec t ions 520 Underground Living Rooms Initial inspections 187 Re-inspections 2,058 Drainage Applications 535 Plans submitted 350 House drains inspected 8,441 House drains tested 874 Factories Acta 1937-1959 Premises inspected 342 Outworkers" premises inspected 262 The following table shows the number of notices issued in respect of nuisances, defects, etc., found during the year:- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Intimation notices 964 Statutory notices 394 Pinal notices 144 Various Factories Acts 8 Report of waste water to the Metropolitan Water Board 37 Report of dangerous structures to the London County Council 26 Other notices 14 -

43 - NOTE: Units means the number of equivalent persons in the families obtained by regarding children between 1 and 10 years of age as "half-persons" and disregarding infants under the age of 12 months. Certificates of Disrepair in relation to Dwelling Houses The Council's duty to issue certificates of disrepair in respect of "rent controlled" dwelling houses, not reasonably suitable for occupation, is governed by the Rent Act, 1957 • The following is a short summary of the procedure:- The standard of repair is to be such as will secure the remedying of defects which ought reasonably to be remedied having due regard to the age, character and locality of the dwelling. The first stage is the tenant must serve a notice on his landlord specifying the defects which he thinks should be remedied. The landlord has six weeks in which to do the work or give an undertaking that the work will be done. If he does neither of these things, the tenant may apply to the Council for a certificate of disrepair. When the Council have decided whether any, or all of the items specified by the tenant justifies the issue of a certificate of disrepair they must notify the landlord and allow him three weeks to reconsider the giving of an undertaking. The Council have a discretion to refuse to accept such an undertaking (and to issue a certificate of disrepair) in certain circumstances. If no undertaking is given and accepted., a certificate of disrepair is issued. The landlord may apply to the Council for cancellation of the certificate if he subsequently does the work. The Council must then ask the tenant if he objects to the cancellation. If he does not object within three weeks, the certificate must be cancelled. If he does object, it is for the Council to decide whether or not to cancel the certificate. For the tenant, the effect of the granting of a certificate, or of failure to carry out an undertaking within six months of the giving of it, is an abatement of the rent. There is provision for recovery of excess rent by the tenant back to the date of application for the certificate, or the date of the undertaking if there has been no such application. A landlord can appeal to the county court against the decision of the Council to issue a certificate, or to refuse to cancel one; and a tenant has similar rights of appeal. The following is a summary of the action taken under the Rent Act, 1957 > during I960:- - 44 - PART I - Applications for Certificates of Disrepair Number of applications for certificates 17 Number of decisions not to issue certificates Nil Number of decisions to issue certificates- (a) in respect of some but not all defects 12 (b) in respect of all defects 5 Number of undertakings given by landlords 15 Number of undertakings refused by Council Nil Number of certificates issued 1 PART II-Applications for Cancellation of Certificates Applications by landlords to Council for cancellation of certificates 11 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates Upheld 3 Certificates cancelled 7 Houses in Multiple Occupation (including hostels) Sections 36 and 90 of the Housing Act, 1957, which applyto any house or part of a house "which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family", give power to the Council to require adequate provision of the following services and amenities:- Natural lighting; Ventilation; Water supply; Drainage and sanitary conveniences; Facilities for storage, preparation and cooking of food, and for the disposal of waste water; Sleeping room accommodation. Section 36 enables the Council to take action if in their opinion the premises are so defective in the matters set out above as not to be reasonably suitable for the number of persons or households in occupation. In such cases they may serve a notice on the person in controls (a) specifying the works required to render the premises reasonably suitable for occupation by those persons or households; (b) requiring the person in control, in default of executing these works within the prescribed period, to take such steps as are reasonably open to him (including, if necessary, the taking of legal proceedings) for securing a reduction in the number of persons accommodated or the number of households, or both, as specified in the notice. Thus, where a notice is served, a choice is given, either to carry out the specified works, or, alternatively, to reduce the intensity of occupation of the house, in which case possession of the house or parts of the house can be obtained by an owner notwithstanding the Rents Acts. Under Section 90, the Council may serve a notice on the occupier, or the person having the control and management of a house or part of a house, where excessive numbers of persons are accommodated, specifying in relation to any room on the premises the maximum number of persons by whom it is suitable to be occupied for sleeping purposes at any one time, or, if appropriate, that the room is unsuitable to be occupied for sleeping purposes. It will be an offence after the notice has become operative to cauae or allow any rooms to be occupied otherwise than in accordance with the notice, or to cause or permit the accommodation to be so occupied that it is not possible to avoid persons of opposite sexes over the age of 12 years (excluding - 45 - persons living together as husband, and. wife) occupying sleeping accommodation in the same room. The premises affected vary considerably and render impracticable the provision of a single rigid code of requirements applicable to all cases. However, the Council have adopted certain minimum standards of the essential services and amenities which they will consider as satisfactory in appropriate cases. The work of enforcing the Council's standards falls into two categories:- (a) where large houses are properly converted for multiple occupation it is found that in practice that owners and contractors co-operate willingly in providing the necessary amenities; (b) in the case of houses which are let for multiple occupation without proper conversion (especially furnished lettings) a certain amount of difficulty has been experienced in enforcing the standards. Usually these houses are of the poorer class property and the occupants are somewhat nomadic in character. In these houses it is difficult to obtain the exact details of occupation, and when pressure is brought to bear upon the landlord he generally has no hesitation in serving notices to quit. In a few cases the Council have had to resort to formal action under Section 36 of the Housing Act, 1957, in order to obtain the desired improvements, and four summonses were issued in respect of continuing offences. Inadequacy of present housing legislation relating to tenement houses. The powers given to the Council by Sections 36 and 90 of the Housing Act, 1957 replaced the Bye-laws for houses let in lodgings which imposed obligations on landlords and tenants to effect the proper maintenance of communal parts of tenement houses. The new powers have proved to be an inadequate substitute for the Bye-laws. During the year special attention was paid to a group of terraced houses (Powis Terrace) which some years ago had been converted into self-contained flats. None of the flats, however, was let as a single dwelling, most of the rooms being let separately. In the 16 houses in this block there were no less than 140 lettings occupied by approximately 300 persons, of whom about 75% were coloured. A survey revealed that in only 10 of the lettings was there statutory overcrowding and of these 6 were non-penal cases. Apart from a complete absence of properly ventilated food cupboards, the amount of sanitary accommodation and facilities for the preparation, storage and cooking of food were adequate. Thus there was little the Council could do under existing legislation to remedy the admittedly unsatisfactory conditions. Many attempts have been made to obtain improvements by exercising the Council's powers under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. These attempts, however, have been frequently frustrated, partly because of the difficulty of ascertaining exactly who was the legal owner at any particular time. A further difficulty was the reluctance of some tenants to attend court. One of the factors mainly accounting for the squalid appearance of these houses was the condition of the entrance halls, the communal staircases and kitchens. The artificial lighting of the halls and staircases was adequate, but the decorations were old - 46 - and. drab. These parts of the houses were seldom swept, with the result that there was an accumulation of litter. Many of the communal kitchens presented an even worse appearance, food refuse having been left about, and little attempt seemed to have been made to clean stoves, sinks or floors. It was doubtful whether the bathrooms were much used, probably owing to lack of hot water, and the condition of many of the water closets indicated lack of normal cleansing. The method of letting produced a great volume of refuse and the number of bins needed could not be housed in the small front areas and cellars. As a result some were kept in the flats and, on collection day, all were brought down and stacked on the front entrance steps. Some refuse was thrown out of rear windows into the areas, where it choked the drains. Few tenants had rent books or received receipts for their rents and this question received the attention of the General Purposes Committee. Subsequently a survey revealed only a few tenants without rent books, and some of these had neglected to obtain them. It was obvious that a social change was taking place which made tenements of the Powis Terrace houses, and this change had made more difficult the problems arising from the integration of a coloured population in the area. An extensive report on the conditions existing in this group of terraced houses was submitted to the Council, who gave consideration to what action could be taken to remedy conditions. The Council felt it would greatly assist, if legislation could be introduced to provide that any nuisance notice served were not invalidated by a change of ownership. Representations to this effect were made by the Metropolitan Boroughs'1 Standing Joint Committee, at the instance of this Council, in 1957, but the Minister then stated that he was very doubtful about the need for amending legislation to increase the existing powers of local authorities, especially as enquiries had shown that Kensington was the only authority affected to any material extent. It was considered that these representations should be renewed. It was decided to make representations to the Metropolitan Boroughs1 Standing Joint Committee to obtain amending legislation to avoid the delays in procedure arising out of repetitive changes in ownership of property. It was also decided to ask the Minister of Housing and Local Government to receive a deputation from the Council. The Standing Joint Committee, after consulting constituent members, felt that further representations could not be supported. However, the Minister agreed to receive the Council's deputation on 4th October, 1960. The deputation received a sympathetic hearing from the Minister, who stated he was not satisfied with the present state of law, but he was not convinced that the proposals of the Council, in their present form, were the best solution. The Minister offered to consider other proposals on specific methods of dealing with the problems. Negotiations with the Minister's officers were continued and it is gratifying to report that eventually a new Housing Bill was issued which included proposed powers to enable local authorities to remedy and prevent unsatisfactory conditions in houses in multiple occupation. - 47 - The Housing Bill as drafted in February, 1961 contained Clause 13(l), which reads as follows:- "With a view to providing a code for the management of houses which may be applied under the last foregoing section, the Minister may by regulations contained in a statutory instrument make provision for the purpose of ensuring that the person managing a house which, or a part of which, is let in lodgings or which is occupied by members of more than one family observes proper standards of management and, in particular, that he ensures the repair, maintenance, cleansing and good order:- (a) of all means of water supply and drainage in the house, (b) of kitchens, bathrooms and water closets in common use, (c) of sinks and wash-basins in common use, (d) of common staircases, corridors and passage ways, and (e) of outbuildings, yards and gardens in common use, and that he makes satisfactory arrangements for the disposal of refuse and litter from the house." The effectiveness, or otherwise, of this clause will depend on how strong are the regulations to be made by the Minister, but there is no doubt that this additional legislation, when passed, will strengthen the powers of the Council in dealing with conditions such as were experienced in Powig Terrace. SLUM CLEARANCE Action already taken The following table gives details of the clearance areas declared by the Council since 1950, when slum clearance work under the Housing Acts was recommenced, up to the end of the year:- - 48 - Name of Area Date of Declaration No. of houses No. of persons displaced Elgin Mews 25. 4.1950 28 86 Lionel Mews (Nos.l and 2) 3.10.1950 13 38 Lonsdale Mews (Nos.l and 2) 2. 1.1951 19 14 Munro Mews 2. 1.1951 24 55 South End Row and Gardens 3. 4.1951 10 4 East Mews Road 3. 4.1951 14 40 Powis Mews 13.11.1951 13 30 St. Luke's Mews 13.11.1951 20 41 Portobello Road 13.11.1951 4 3 Kensal New Town (NO.l)Area 11.12.1956 34 309 Kensal New Town (No.2) Area 14. 1.1958 62 441 Kensal New Town (No.3) Area 14. 1.1958 15 146 Portland Road (No.l) Area 11. 3.1958 5 31 Portland Road (No.2) Area 11. 3.1958 10 71 Kensal New Town (No.4) Area 8. 3.1960 7 41 Kensal New Town (No.5) Area 8. 3.1960 20 187 Kensal New Town (No.6) Area 8. 3.1960 6 62 Railway Mews Area 10. 5.1960 10 7 In addition, the London County Council, with the agreement of the Borough Council, have dealt with the Fenelon Place/Ashley Cottages/ Warwick Road clearance area, containing 66 premises, with an estimated population of 57 families comprising 176 persons. Programme for Slum Clearance The original survey (made under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954-now repealed) revealed that of 7,4l6 houses, where the conditions were known to be below standard, 3,293 houses were unfit for habitation. Following that survey, the Council, in conjunction with the London County Council, submitted proposals for dealing with slum clearance areas to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, which were approved. Part of the programme has been dealt with, and taking into account a review which took place in 1959, the following is the current programme now facing the Council Name Premises Estimated population Families Persons Kensington Park Mews 13 9 26 Stanley Gardens Mews 4 2 5 Lecky Street 5 2 Kensal New Town (remainder) 372 692 2,364 Portobello Road/ Telford Road 18 52 127 - 49 - In addition, negotiations have taken place between the Council and the London County Council in regard to the proposal to redevelop an area known as the "Blechynden Street area." The allocation of responsibility between the two authorities has been agreed as follows:- To be developed by the London County Council: Blechynden Street area north west of railway Gross area in acres 8.30 To be developed by the Council: Blechynden Street area south east of railway Gross area xn acres 11.40 It will be appreciated that by no means all the properties in this area are suitable for action under "slum clearance" and the extent to which action under Part III of the Housing Act, 1957 can be taken, will depend on the results of a survey of individual properties. Kensal New Town Area This area, which is a large one consisting of over 20 acres, has received special consideration by both the Council and the London County Council. The problem of overspill of population necessitates the decanting of persons at present living in the area while the development on cleared sites proceeds. The original development plan, as approved by the Council, proposed action in three phases. The first portion of acres has been tackled by the Council. Six separate slum clearance areas have been declared, properties have been demolished and the rebuilding development of two tower blocks (each comprising 78 dwellings) and forty flats and maisonettes in four-storey blocks are expected to be ready for occupation in 1961/1962. The remainder of the area is complicated by town planning considerations. Negotiations between the London County Council, the Council and the Paddington Council have taken place, especially on the question of the overspill as related to the permitted density of rebuilding. The Council's members continued vigorously to press for an increased density to be allowed for rebuilding in the area to permit the provision of more housing accommodation and thus to reduce the overspill problem. They particularly stressed the human factors involved, namely, that the Kensal New Town area is a closelyknit one and it is most desirable to avoid destroying the many personal relationships in the neighbourhood. The London County Council's view has been that no case could be made for a density modification at this stage as the written statement specifically excludes comprehensive development areas from the special areas where higher densities can be permitted and the area does not measure up to the other qualifications for permitting higher densities, such as proximity to major open space, etc. The London County Council also stated that a higher density would necessitate a greater open space provision, so reducing the land available for housing. In view of the inability of the two authorities to reach agreement on the question of density, the Council authorised the lodging with the Minister of Housing and Local Government of a formal objection to the London County Council's density proposals for the area. - 50 - Apart from this question of density, the discussions with the London County Council have been directed towards the most appropriate method of obtaining the earliest possible redevelopment of the area, and the conclusion has been reached that, in the circumstances as they now exist, a division of responsibility for the area between the two Councils would be most likely to achieve this result. The main residential zone will now lie between Kensal Road and the railway, and the Council approved the following proposals which have been agreed in broad outline:- (i) The Council will undertake the redevelopment of 3.1 acres to the north and 1.62 acres to the south of the 6½ acres upon which they are at present engaged. This area, including the present 6½ acres, is bounded by Kensal Road, Golborne Road, Bosworth Road and the railway. (ii) The London County Council will undertake the redevelopment of 7.2 acres to the east of the borough council's present 6½ acres. This area is bounded by Golborne Road, Kensal Road and the railway. The London County Council will also be responsible for redeveloping a small area of 0.41 acres between Kensal Road and the canal, to the west of an area in Paddington of 3.6 acres which the County Council now propose to zone as open space in place of the open space of 3.6 acres originally proposed at the eastern end of the area. The London County Council will be responsible for school extensions and the provision of additional open space north of the canal. ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING OF COMMON STAIRCASES IN TENEMENT HOUSES AND FLATS Council Byelaws relating to artificial lighting of common staircases in tenement houses and flats came into operation on 11th March, 1958. The principal Byelaw reads as follows:- "The occupier of every tenement house to which these Byelaws apply and the owner of every block of flats shall provide adequate artificial lighting for all common staircases:- (a) from half an hour before sunset until 12 o'clock midnight; (b) for one hour before sunrise during the months of October, November, December, January, February and March; and (c) at other times as and when necessary if adequate means of natural lighting are not provided." During 1960, formal notices were served in 2 cases, requiring compliance with these Byelaws. IMPROVEMENT OR CONVERSION OF EXISTING HOUSES There are two methods by which owners of private dwellings may apply to the Council for assistance towards carrying out works of improvement or conversion. - 51- The first method is to apply for an improvement grantknown as a discretionary grant-under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958. The maximum grant payable is one half of the approved expenditure (which must not be less than £100) subject to a maximum allowance of £400. In considering a scheme of improvement or conversion submitted for grant, only one question may properly be asked, namely, whether it will produce a satisfactory modernised dwelling complying with the statutory conditions and the specified requirements. The requirements which the Minister of Housing and Local Government has specified for a dwelling in respect of which an improvement grant may be made are as follows:- The dwelling must, after improvement or conversion- 1. be in a good state of repair and substantially free from damp; 2. have each room properly lighted and ventilated; 3. have an adequate supply of wholesome water laid on inside the dwelling; 4. be provided with efficient and adequate means of supplying hot water for domestic purposes; 5. have an internal or otherwise readily accessible water closet; 6. have a fixed bath (or shower) preferably in a separate room; 7. be provided with a sink or sinks and with suitable arrangements for the disposal of waste water; 8. have a proper drainage system; 9. be provided in each room with adequate points for gas or electric lighting (where reasonably available); 10. be provided with adequate facilities for heating; 11. have satisfactory facilities for storing, preparing and cooking food; 12. have proper provision for the storage of fuel (where required). Applications for improvement (discretionary) grants received and dealt with during 1960 sire summarised as follows:- Applications received 58 Applications granted 32 Applications withdrawn after approval 5 Applications refused 1 Total amount of grants approved £12,004. 0s. 0d. - 52 - The second method is to apply for standard grants, which were introduced by the House Purchase & Housing Act, 1959, which came into operation on 14th June, 1959. The Act sets up a new system of standard grants to supplement the present system of improvement grants paid at the discretion of the local authority. The distinctive features of the new system are that these grants are payable only in respect of the provision of specified standard amenities and on the expenditure actually incurred for this purpose; and that provided certain conditions are satisfied the owner of the property can claim the grant as of right. The new system has been designed to produce as simple a procedure as possible and enable owners generally to form a reasonably accurate idea of the assistance they can hope to receive before any expense is incurred. It is designed to deal in the main with relatively straightforward cases in which the improvements involve little or no structural alteration, leaving the present system of discretionary grants to deal with the more elaborate proposals. There are five standard amenities (listed in Section 4(l) as shown below) eligible for standard grant, which is one half of the cost shown to have been incurred in executing the works involved, subject to a maximum payment of £155. The maximum payment is reduced by the amount shown in parentheses in cases where the particular provision is omitted, as having been already provided:- (a) A fixed bath or shower in a bathroom (£25) (b) A wash-hand basin (£5) (c) A hot water supply (£75) (d) A water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling (£40) (e) Satisfactory facilities for storing food (£10) These amenities must be for the exclusive use of the occupants of the particular dwelling. The dwelling must after improvement be equipped with all five standard amenities; conversely, grant is not payable towards the cost of providing a second watercloset or other amenity if there is already one in the house. If a hot water supply is provided it must be connected to a sink as well as to the bath or shower and wash-hand basin (Section 4(5)). The works which may qualify for grant are such works for the improvement of a dwelling as are required to provide it with such of the standard amenities as it lacks and "improvement" bears the meaning given to it by Section 42(2) of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958. Thus to the direct cost of installing, say, a bath or wash-hand basin there may be added the cost of any necessary structural alterations and consequent redecoration; while in some cases it may be impracticable to do the work without removing and replacing elsewhere an existing facility such as a sink or foodstore. The test to be applied in considering whether expenditure on any particular work is eligible for grant is whether it would in all the circumstances have been reasonably practicable to equip the dwelling with the amenities it lacked without carrying out that work. No application for a standard grant can be entertained if the dwelling concerned was provided after the end of 1944, with one exception. If the dwelling was produced by conversion and the original building was erected before the end of 1944, then provided the conversion was completed not later than the end of 1958, the dwelling will be eligible for standard grant purposes (Section 4(6)). - 55 - As under the existing discretionary grant system, for grant to be payable the approval of the authority must be obtained before work is begun and the work must be done to their satisfaction (Section 4(l)). During i960, eight applications for standard grants were received in respect of individual premises. Of these, seven were refused as the statutory conditions were not complied with, and the other application, although approved, was subsequently withdrawn. In addition, applications were received from a Housing Trust in respect of the provision of a wash-hand basin in each of 44 flats in an estate under their control, and were approved for the standard grant of £5 in each case. OVERCROWDING In view of the shortage of housing accommodation, created by the war, the Council had up to 1958 operated the overcrowding provisions of the Housing Acts under a special scheme. In November, 1958, however, it was decided to deal with all cases of overcrowding on the strict interpretation of the standards laid down in the Housing Act, 1957: distinguishing between "penal" and "non-penal" cases. A review of all the known cases of overcrowding which the Public Health Committee had, under their previous scheme, regarded as less serious was completed during the year and it was found that in a further 90 cases the overcrowding had been abated, making a total of 665. The number of new cases of overcrowding reported to the Committee during 1960 was 112, giving an equivalent number of persons of 426. The total number of overcrowding cases which were recorded during the year as having been abated was 205, comprising a total of 779.units. ASSESSMENT OF HOUSING PRIORITIES ON MEDICAL GROUNDS During the year 156 applications for re-housing on medical grounds were examined, and recommendations for the award of additional points were made to the Chief Housing Officer. In each case the precise medical condition and resultant disability were determined (frequently necessitating communication with the family doctor or with the hospital attended). The premises were inspected in detail to ascertain the extent and nature of the existing accommodation; the adequacy of day and sleeping space; the risk of infection; the existence of remediable or irremediable sanitary or structural defects, and the existence of inconveniences, such as stairs, which might be prejudicial to the patient. On this information and that supplied by the Chief Housing Officer, an assessment of points to be awarded on medical grounds was made in 155 cases. PROVISION OF NEW HOUSING ACCOMMODATION The post-war housing schemes completed in Kensington by the Council have provided 1,520 flats. The total number of properties under Council management at the end of 1960 is summarised in the following table:- - 54 - Housing properties 1890 Act 18 Cottage Estates 219 1919 Conversions 95 Pre~war Flats 306 Sundry Properties 63 701 Temporary Bungalows 51 Compulsory Purchase Area/properties 61 1949 Act Conversions 98 Post-war Plats 1,520 1,730 Nos.27/29 Hazlewood Crescent 10 Properties formerly requisitioned (in Family Units) 421 Other Properties Henry Dickens Court Garages 10 Ingelow House Garages 12 25 Basing Street Garages 2 Gadsden Mews Stores and Stables 17 Lonsdale Mews Stores and Stables 17 Treverton Street Garages and shops 14 72 2,934 Other schemes for building new housing accommodation are in various stages of preparation.

IN SHOPS Certificates of Exemption Under Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950 the Council may grant a certificate exempting a shop from the provision of suitable and sufficient water closet accommodation or washing facilities if they are satisfied that by reason of restricted accommodation or other special circumstances affecting the shop it is reasonable that such a certificate should be in force, and that suitable and sufficient accommodation or facilities are otherwise conveniently available. The Council have decided that in those shops where members of both sexes are employed, separate sanitary conveniences for each sex should be required if the number of employees exceeds four, but if the number is less than four, one sanitary convenience should be regarded as suitable and sufficient, provided that the door of the convenience is fitted with a proper lock or fastener on the internal side, and an automatic indicator shows on the external side of the door whether the apartment is engaged or vacant. During the year 1960, one exemption certificate under the Shops Act was granted in respect of the provision of water closet accommodation. Similarly, under the Pood Hygiene Regulations, exemption may now be granted in food shops in respect of the provision of constant water supply, wash-hand basins with hot and cold water, cupboard or locker accommodation for outdoor clothing and facilities for washing food and equipment, if such provision cannot reasonably be required. During 1960, no exemption certificate was issued under the Pood Hygiene Regulations. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1958, transferred to metropolitan borough councils, from 1st January, 1959 the responsibility for enforcing provisions of the Shops Act, 1950 relating to adequate lighting, suitable and sufficient washing facilities and, where employees take any meals in the shop premises, suitable and sufficient facilities for taking those meals. The London County Council are empowered, however, to retain the above functions in relation to any shop at a place of public entertainment, and they have given formal notice that the transfer of functions will not apply to the following premises in Kensington:- Twentieth Century Theatre 291 Westbourne Grove, W.ll Imperial Playhouse 191 Portobello Road, W.ll Royalty Cinema (Closed) 105-109 Lancaster Road, W.ll Classic Cinema 87 Notting Hill Gate, W„ll The Gaumont Notting Hill Gate, W.ll Odeon Theatre 263 Kensington High Street, W.0 Chanticleer Theatre Clareville Street, S.W.7 Paris Pullman Cinema Drayton Gardens, S.W.10 Forum Theatre 142-150 Fulham Road, S.W.10 - 59 - SUPERVISION OF FOOD SUPPLIES FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 This Act, which came into operation on 1st January, 1956 is now the principal Act for controlling the composition, labelling, fitness and hygienic handling of food. FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 These Regulations are the principal instruments for enforcing good food hygiene practice in foodshops. Their title emphasises the changing trend whereby a national policy is developing along the lines of clean food handling to safe food. The Regulations replace the former Section 13 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and whilst they may be thought capable of varying interpretation, they constitute a considerable improvement. A brief summary of the main requirements is as follows:- Requirements affecting food handlers Persons handling food must- (a) keep their hands and clothing clean; (b) cover open cuts and abrasions with a water-proof dressing; (c) refrain from spitting; (d) refrain from smoking or taking snuff when handling food or when in any room where there is open food; (e) not place food so as to involve risk of contamination; (f) not allow unclean or printed wrapping material to come into contact with food; (g) notify the occupier (and owner) if suffering from, or becoming a carrier of, certain infectious conditions. Requirements relating to food premises (a) No room which communicates with a sanitary con- venience may be used for the handling of food or the cleaning of equipment; (b) notices requesting users to wash their hands must be displayed in every sanitary convenience; (c) a constant, clean and wholesome water supply must be provided; (d) suitable and sufficient wash-basins must be provided, together with a supply of hot and cold water, soap, nailbrush and clean towels; (e) in premises where open food is handled, suitable and sufficient sinks, together with an adequate supply of hot and cold water, soap or suitable detergent, and of clean cloths must be provided, and in addition adequate and suitable cleaning and drying facilities; (f) lighting and ventilation of food rooms must be adequate and satisfactory; (g) walls, floors, windows, ceiling, woodwork, doors and all other parts of structure of every food room, must be kept clean, and in such good order, repair and condition, as to enable them to be effectively cleaned and prevent risk of infestation by rats, mice, insects and birds. - 60 - Requirements relating to food stalls Every stall- (a) must bear the name and address of the person carrying on the business; (b) must be kept clean and in good repair; (c) when used for meat and fish, must be covered over and screened at the sides and back, and a covered metal refuse bin must be provided for all waste trimmings; (d) when used for open food, for immediate consumption, must be provided with suitable and sufficient sinks for washing food and equipment, together with a supply of hot and cold water, soap, nailbrush, clean towels and drying cloths. Requirements relating to the Transport and Carrying of Meat Vehicles carrying "open" meat must enclose completely the part in which meat is carried; have an impervious floor or movable duckboards; be kept clean and in good order} have suitable impervious clean receptacles to contain offal separately, except where no meat other than offal is being carried. Persons carrying "open" meat must wear a clean washable overall and head covering. Generally Suitable and sufficient bandages, dressings and antiseptic must be provided and maintained in food premises. Sufficient and suitable cupboard or locker accommodation for clothing and footwear must be provided for persons engaged in or about food premises. In premises where the business consists wholly or partly of the supply of food for immediate consumption, food consisting of meat, fish, gravy or imitation cream, or prepared from or containing these substances, or any egg or milk, must be kept at a temperature above 145°F or below 50.F. Pood in or about any forecourt, yard, market or stall must not be placed lower than 18 inches from the ground. A person guilty of an offence against any of these Regulations shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both, and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding £5 for each day during which the offence continues after conviction. During the year, the public health inspectors have been engaged on surveying food premises in the borough and a total of 2,111 inspections was made. In 25 cases it was necessary to send informal notices pointing out deficiencies under the Regulations and, generally speaking, the food traders are complying with the requirements in a co-operative raanner. It was, however, found necessary to take legal proceedings for contraventions of the Regulations, as follows:- - 61 - DETAILS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TAKEN UNDER FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS IN 1960 As requested by Ministry of Health Circular 22/58.

During the year no contravention was reported to the public health department. Composition of Milk During the year, three hundred and fifty-eight samples of milk (all grades) were submitted tothe Public Analyst. One was found to be below the legal and presumptive standards laid down, and the result was sent to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood. The following table shows the percentages of milk-fat and non-fat solids of the genuine samples of milk, other than Channel Islands and South Devon Milk, taken during each month. It should be mentioned that, included in these, are 15 samples certified by the Analyst to be genuine, although the percentage of solids-notfat was slightly below the presumptive standard of 8.5%.

This compares with the presumptive milk fat standard of 3% specified for ordinary milk by the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1939. - 65 - During the year, one hundred and twenty-three samples of these milks were taken and one was found to be below the legal standard laid down. The Public Health Committee decided to issue a warning to the producer. The following table shows the average percentages of milk fat and non-fat solids of the genuine samples of these milks taken during each month:- Month No. of samples taken Average percentages Milk fats Non-fat solids January 10 4.23 8.91 February 13 4.33 8.91 March 8 4.48 8.96 April 6 4.11 9.09 May 16 4.12 9.03 June 8 4.20 8.97 July 13 4.53 8.92 August 4 4.21 8.89 September 11 4.32 8.98 October 16 4.49 9.07 November 9 4.52 9.23 December 8 4.43 8.99 Average for the whole year 4.31 8.99 Legal minimum standards 4.00 8.50 Unsound food Seizure Under Part 1 of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, it is an offence to sell, offer, or expose for sale, or to be in possession for the purpose of sale or preparation for sale, food intended for human consumption which is in an unfit condition. Such food can be seized and taken before a Justice of the Peace who can condemn it, and order it to be destroyed or disposed of for purposes other than human consumption. During the year there was one occasion when it was found necessary to enforce this procedure. This concerned the exposure for sale of packeted chocolate which was found to be infested with maggots. Bars and slabs of chocolate, total weight 11 lbs. 2¾ ozs., were seized and taken before a magistrate who condemned them as being unfit for human consumption. The Public Health Committee authorised that legal proceedings be taken in this case. The defendant was fined £10. 0s. 0d. and ordered to pay £3.5s.0d. costs to the Council. Surrender Any person having in his possession food which is diseased, unsound, or unfit for human consumption can, under Section 180(8) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, surrender it to the Council for destruction or other suitable method of disposal. During the year the following amounts of food were surrendered and condemned as unfit for human consumption:- 66 Food Tons Cwt. Qrs. Lb. Meat (raw) 7 1 22 Meat (tinned) 17 2 27 Ham 1 3 1 4 Pish (wet and dry) 12 - 7 Sausage 4 - 12 Sugar 1 - 12 Cheese 1 3 Dried Fruit 2 1 27 Sauerkraut 1 3 21 Cooking fats and butter 1 3 27 Rabbits (imported) 1 16 TOTAL 5 12 3 10 Tins, jars, packets or cartons of fruit, vegetables and miscellaneous foodstuffs 11,029 All food condemned as unfit for human consumption is collected by the Council, taken to their refuse destructor in Wood Lane and destroyed. In no instance were large quantities of food involved, necessitating special examination of stocks of food. Complaints by purchasers of unfit food During the year 21 complaints were received from members of the public, alleging the unsatisfactory condition of food purchased by them in the borough. The complaints generally related to the presence of foreign matter in foods, mouldy condition of bread, and the unsatisfactory condition of liver, meat, fishpaste and soups. In all cases it was decided to take no legal action and the complaints were dealt with informally, either owing to lack of proper evidence, or to the complaint not being substantiated. Adulteration of Food During the year, 572 formal samples of food and drugs were purchased, of which 10 (1.7%) were either adulterated or otherwise unsatisfactory. 428 informal samples were also purchased, of which 18 (4.2%) were either adulterated or otherwise unsatisfactory. The following table summarizes the action taken in respect of the defective samples:- Unsatisfactory sample No. of Prosecutions No. of warnings to Producers, Manufacturers or Vendors No further action Total Instant Coffee 1 4 5 Chocolate 1 2 3 Milk 1 1 2 4 Evaporated milk - 1 1 Shredded Beef Suet - 2 2 Tomato Puree - 1 1 2 Canned Boneless Chicken - 1 1 Dessert Powder Fruit Soup mix - 1 1 Meat Pie - 1 1 Sausages (pork) - 1 1 2 Ground nutmeg - 1 - 1 Coloured coconut 1 1 2 Cochineal 2 2 Glace Cherries - 1 - 1 TOTALS: 6 5 17+ 28 + In all cases the results of these unsatisfactory samples were brought to the notice of the producers, manufacturers, or vendors as the case may be. 67 Ice Cream The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959, and the Labelling of Food (Amendment) Regulations, 1959, have been made jointly by the Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. They came into operation on 27th April, 1959, and repealed the previous Order of 1953. The ice cream regulations prescribe amended standards for ice cream and introduce separate standards for "dairy ice cream" (or "dairy cream ice" or "cream ice"), and for "milk ice". The legal Standards of Composition for ice cream are as follows:- (a) Ice cream shall contain not less than 5 per cent. fat and 7½ per cent. milk solids other than fat, so, however, that where ice cream contains any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree it shall either conform to the above standard or, alternatively, the total content of fat and milk solids other than fat 3hall be not less than 12½ per cent. of the whole including the fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree, as the case may be, and such total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not less than 7½ per cent. fat and 2 per cent. milk solids other than fat: Provided that as respects any ice cream sold, or offered or exposed for sale under any of the descriptions hereinafter specified, or under any such other description as is calculated to lead an intending purchaser to believe that he is purchasing ice cream of any such description as is so specified, the standard of composition shall be as follows:- (i) Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice or Cream Ice shall in each case contain not less than 5 per cento milk fat and no other fat (save as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent) and not less than 7½ per cent. milk solids other than fat, so, however, that where any Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice or Cream Ice contains any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree it shall either conform to the standard of composition for that ice cream, or alternatively, the total content of milk fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½ per cent. of the whole including the fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree, as the case may be, and such total content of milk fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not less than 7½ per cento milk fat and no other fat (save as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent) and not less than 2 per cent. milk solids other than fat. (ii) Milk Ice, or Milk Ice containing any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree, shall contain not less than 2½ per cent. milk fat and no other fat (save as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent) and not less than 7 per cento milk solids other than fat. 68 (iii) "Parev" (kosher) ice shall contain not less than 10 per cent. fat and no milk fat or other derivative of milk. (b) No ice cream of any description shall contain anyartificial sweetener. The previous requirement that ice cream shall contain not less than 10 per cent. of sugar has been revoked. The Labelling Regulations prohibit the labelling, marking or advertising of ice cream in a manner suggestive of butter, cream, milk, or anything connected with the dairy interest unless the ice cream contains no fat other than milk fat (except such as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, flavouring substance, or emulsifying or stabilising agent), but permit the presence of skimmed milk solids to be declared. These regulations also provide that, after 30th November, 1959, it will be an offence to sell under the description "ice cream", any pre-packed ice cream which contains fat other than milk fat unless it bears on the wrapper or container a declaration "Contains non-milk fat", or, if appropriate, "Contains vegetable fat", in type of a prescribed minimum size. The following table shows the number of samples (16 ice cream and 2 dairy ice cream) taken during 1960 for chemical analysis compared with those taken in the previous year:- 1959 1960 Number of samples 19 18 Variation of fat content per cent 8.1 to 13.3 8.3 to 12.3 Variation of non-fat content per cent 22.6 to 32.1 22.5 to 32.3 Average fat content per cent 11.25 10.51 Average non-fat solids content per cent 26.44 26.56 The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1959, came into operation on 27th April, 1959, and revoked the Regulations of 1947 to 1952. They require that ingredients used in the manufacture of ice cream are to be pasteurized by one or other of three specified methods, viz:- Method I The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than 150°F. for at least 30 minutes. Method II The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than 160°F. for at least 10 minutes. Method III The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than 170°F. for at least 15 seconds. An alternative method is by sterilisation by raising the mixture to a temperature of not less than 300°F. for at least 2 seconds. 69 After pasteurization or sterilisation the mixture has to be reduced to a temperature of not more than 45°F. within 1½ hours and kept at this temperature until frozen, after which it must be kept at a temperature not exceeding 28°F. up to the time of being sold. There is still no legal bacteriological standard for ice cream. As in previous years, samples were taken and submitted for examination under the provisional methylene blue reduction test which is a simple and practical means for the routine examination of ice cream. The test is not of sufficient precision to justify its use as a statutory test. The grading is determined by the length of time taken to decolourize the methylene blue and it is suggested that if samples consistently fail to reach grades 1 and 2 it would be reasonable to regard this as an indication of defects in manufacture or handling which warrant further investigation. During the year 23 samples of ice cream were also taken and submitted to the methylene blue test. The results are as follows:- Grade No. of samples 1 10 2 4 3 2 4 7 Premises in the borough where ice cream is manufactured, stored or sold were frequently inspected during the year and generally were found to be in a satisfactory condition, having regard to the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1959. Condensed Milk The Condensed Milk Regulations, 1959, made jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood, and the Minister of Health, came into operation on 26th June, 1959. They substantially re-enact in a consolidated and revised form the Public Health (Condensed Milk) Regulations, 1923/l953. Certain new provisions have been introduced, the principal ones being:- (a) to provide for the sale of condensed partly skimmed (half cream) milk labelled "should not be used for babies except under medical advice" (b) to define half cream milk as meaning milk which contains not less than lO.8% of milk solids including not less than l.8% milk fat (c) to prescribe minimum percentages of milk fat and milk solids including fat for condensed partly skimmed (half cream) milk. During the year 11 samples of condensed milk were submitted for analysis and found to comply with the requirements. One sample, however, was found upon examination to be sour and curdled. The retailers were notified and immediately withdrew the remaining stock of this particular brand from sale. No further action was taken. 70 Bacteriological Examinations of Prawns and other similar sea-foods During the year an investigation was carried out in regard to the bacteriological standard of various sea foods exposed for sale in the large stores, fishmongers and delicatessen shops in the borough. Fifty-eight samples were obtained, most of which were prawns, and submitted to examination by the Public Health Laboratory Service. There is no national bacteriological standard for these types of foods but, in the case of imported prawns, the Public Health Laboratory Service and the Medical Committee of the Association of Sea and Air-port Health Authorities decided, pending the establishment of an official standard, that prawns should comply with a two-day 37° plate count of not more than 250,000 per gram. The following table shows the total count of the 58 samples examined:- Sample Total Viable Count per gram Total Samples 50,000 +50,000/ 200,000 +200,000/ 250,000 +250,000 Prawns 17 12 4 4 37 Others 14 2 2 3 21 Total 31 14 6 7 58 Examinations were also made in respect of Bacteria Coli, the results being as follows:- Present in 1 20 gms. 35 Present in under 1 gm. 7 Absent 16 Total 58 With reference to the 7 samples showing a viable count above 250,000 per grm. the Bacteriologist felt that, taking into account delays in transport and retail and the known inaccuracies of the viable count, it was not regarded as serious. It was considered that the overall results were encouraging and that the general standard seemed to be good. General There are no abattoirs or slaughterhouses in the borough, and no killing of animals for human consumption is carried out. - 71 FOOD POISONING The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, requires any medical practitioner, on becoming aware that a person is suffering or is suspected to be suffering from food poisoning, to notify the Medical Officer of Health. The following table gives a summary of all cases (notified or not) brought to notice during 1960:- Food poisoning notifications (corrected) First quarter 4 Second quarter 15 Third quarter 13 Fourth quarter 8 TOTAL: 40 Cases otherwise ascertained 6 Fatal cases: Nil.

The other outbreak involved six schoolboys from Shaftesbury, Dorset, who had visited an exhibition in Kensington. All six were treated in a local hospital. More cases from the same school party were notified to the Medical Officer of Health of Chelsea, after they had attended a Chelsea hospital. All the boys affected had eaten minced beef and gravy paste sandwiches which had been prepared in their school canteen. The causative agent was staphylococcal infection, and bacteriological examination of the food at Shaftesbury corroborated the findings in these cases. 72 Details of the three minor family outbreaks are given below:- (a) A man and his wife suffered from food poisoning after eating pork brawn. Bacteriological examination revealed the causative agent to be Salmonella typhimurium. Other samples of the brawn taken from the distributors, and the manufacturers, whose premises were in another borough, proved bacteriologically unsound. Production and distribution of the brawn was stopped until a satisfactory standard of hygiene was achieved at the manufacturer's premises. (b) Twins, aged 5 months, were infected with Salmonella typhimurium and spent a period of approximately one month in hospital before recovery. The source of the infection was not traced. (c) A mother, aged 41, and her child, aged 4, suffered from Salmonella typhimurium food poisoning. The source of the infection was not traced. Outbreaks of undiscovered cause The one family outbreak notified as being due to food poisoning involved a father and young son, who were also notified as suffering from Sonne Dysentery. Bacteriological evidence suggested that their illness was in fact mild dysentery, and not food poisoning. Single Cases In addition to the outbreaks, 27 single cases of food poisoning were notified, and two single cases were otherwise ascertained. No causative agent was identified in 19 of these cases. The identified agent which caused the other 10 cases was Salmonella typhimurium. Salmonella Infections not food-borne One family outbreak of Salmonella infection was discovered during 196O. This involved two female children (aged 2 years and 9/12) and one woman (aged 2l). The causative agent was Salmonella enteriditis, and the infections cleared after suitable medical treatment. INFECTIOUS DISEASE Smallpox No case of smallpox was notified in the borough during 1960. In the Ministry of Health's Memorandum on Vaccination against smallpox, it was recommended that public health officers, likely to have to deal with cases of smallpox at short notice, should be regularly re-vaccinated at not more than yearly intervals. During the year 23 members of the staff of the public health department were vaccinated or re-vaccinated by the Medical Officer of Health. Notice was received from the Ministry of Health that smallpox had been diagnosed in a man who had arrived from abroad by air. At the time of his arrival, the man was in an infectious state and had moved around in London considerably before feeling ill. The man had travelled by underground train and taxi and had 73 visited. Wormwood Scrubs Prison, two restaurants and the Charing Cross Hospital. Numerous direct and indirect contacts were traced and were advised to be vaccinated. Vaccination of contacts in Kensington was undertaken by the public health department, where necessary. Close contacts were kept under daily surveillance throughout the incubation period and a stewardess who had travelled in the same aeroplane was placed under "house and garden" quarantine. No secondary cases were reported. Scarlet Fever The number of cases notified in 1960 was 29, but only one was treated in hospital. There was no fatal case during the year; in fact, there has been no death from scarlet fever in Kensington since 1940. Diphtheria No case of diphtheria was notified during the year. A summary of the diphtheria immunisation work, carried out by the London County Council during the year in Kensington, is as follows:- Number of pre-school children immunised 2,340 " " school " " 316 " " boosters (all ages) 1,528 Enteric Fever During the year there were 4 cases of typhoid fever and 4 of paratyphoid fever. The first case of typhoid fever was a 29-year old man who was ill immediately after returning from a holiday in Spain, but did not see a doctor for more than a month afterwards, when he was immediately admitted to hospital. The contacts of the case were traced and asked to submit specimens for bacteriological examination. All proved negative. The patient recovered. The second case was a 61-year old woman whose basement flat had been badly flooded a few days before her illness. She had left her home the day after the flooding for a holiday in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk. When she returned she was admitted to hospital. The possibilities of her having been infected by the flood sewage or at Bury St. Edmunds were thoroughly investigated. Bacteriology of scrapings from the floor and floor coverings from the woman's home revealed nothing. The Medical Officer of Health at Bury St. Edmunds organised enquiries and tests at the house temporarily occupied by the patient while she was on holiday. Specimens submitted by all the contacts proved negative and the source of infection in this case remained unsolved. The third case was a 26-year old man who was admitted to hospital as a typhoid "carrier" four months after returning from a business trip in Nigeria and Central Africa. He had felt unwell consistently since his return to this country. The man's wife the only home contact submitted negative specimens. The fourth typhoid case was a 25-year old woman, who developed the illness a few days after returning from a holiday in Spain and was admitted to hospital. Specimens taken from the home contacts proved negative. The patient recovered in hospital and specimens were taken from her after discharge to ensure that she had not become a carrier of the disease. 74 The first patients reported with paratyphoid fever in 1960 were two young women aged 23 and 24 who were admitted to hospital from the same address. In common with another woman and her husband, they used the same crockery and toilet facilities. Tests of the specimens submitted by the other woman and her husband proved negative. One of the patients had lived for a time in Spain and had returned to this country six months before the onset of her illness. It is probable that she became a "carrier" in Spain and had transmitted the disease to the other girl. The third patient with paratyphoid fever was a 1½-year old boy whose illness came to light through examination of a stool specimen taken after his brothers had been reported to be suffering from dysentery. His immediate removal to hospital was arranged, and more specimens were taken from his brothers and other home contacts. These were found to be negative. The child recovered in hospital, but the exact source of hi3 illness remained undiscovered. The fourth case of paratyphoid fever was a 33-year old labourer who had been engaged on sew.er repair work in another borough the Medical Officer of Health of this borough was informed. No details of the foods eaten by the patient were available. The home contacts submitted negative specimens and the man recovered in hospital. Puerperal Pyrexia During 1960, the number of cases of this disease notified was 138, of whom 104 were persons normally resident outside Kensington. All but one of these cases occurred in hospital. In order to show some perspective in reviewing the incidence of puerperal pyrexia (defined as any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4°F. or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage), the following table gives an analysis of the causes of pyrexia in the notified cases:- Cause No. of cases Breast infections 18 Respiratory infections:- Upper 1 7 Lower 6 Urinary infection 23 Pyrexia associated with abnormal delivery:- (a) Retained products 2 11 (b) A.R.M. or Forceps 3 (c) Caesarian section 6 Genital tract infections 9 Thrombophlebitis 1 Allergic reaction 1 Causes unknown after investigation 68 Total 138 In addition to the above, information was received concerning 44 patients normally resident in Kensington, who were notified as suffering from puerperal pyrexia in other London districts. No death occurred under this heading. Pneumonia There are various forms of pneumonia, but the only types notifiable are (i) acute primary and (ii) acute influenzal pneumonia. During the year 16 notifications were received, 14 being acute 75 primary pneumonia and 2 being acute influenzal pneumonia. Of the total, 4 cases were removed to hospital for treatment. The number of deaths from pneumonia (all forms) was 70, and the number of deaths from influenza was 4 during 1960. Dysentery Seventy-one cases of dysentery were notified during 1960, all of which were bacillary in origin, the majority being due to the Sonne bacillus. Generally speaking the cases were of a mild type and there were no deaths. Fifteen of these patients were treated in hospital. Erysipelas Nine cases were notified during the year; eight were treated at home, and one was admitted to hospital. There were no deaths. Meningococcal Infection Four cases of this disease were notified during the year and were removed to hospital. No deaths were reported. Malaria Two cases of malaria were reported during the year, but investigations showed that the patients had recently returned from abroad, and presumably had contracted infection overseas. Poliomyelitis Three cases of acute poliomyelitis were notified and confirmed during the year; all showed symptoms of paralysis. There was no death from this disease during the year. The figures in the last six years are as follows:- Year Confirmed cases Deaths 1955 30 Nil 1956 21 Nil 1957 15 1 1958 4 Nil 1959 8 Nil 1960 3 Nil There were 6 suspected cases removed to hospital, where the diagnosis was not confirmed. Contacts of all cases were kept under surveillance for twenty-one days (or until the diagnosis was changed in unconfirmed cases). Kensington residents, who were contacts of cases occurring outside the borough, were also kept under observation. The number of confirmed cases is the lowest for very many years and follows the general pattern of notifications for England and Wales. In fact, in 1960 there were only 66 deaths recorded in England and Wales, the lowest since the epidemic of 1947. Evidence that vaccination against poliomyelitis is effective increases every year and a recent report by the World Health Organisation Expert Committee states that "inactivated vaccines have proved to be safe and effective". It is probably true to say that vaccination is slowly and steadily reducing the number of cases all over the world. However, there is no cause for complacency and every effort must be taken to see that the level of protected persons in the borough is raised as high as possible. 77 Acute Encephalitis No case of acute encephalitis was notified during the year. Measles Of the 457 cases notified during 1960, 8 were admitted to hospital for treatment. No death occurred under this heading. Attempts have been made from time to time to explain the biennial periodicity of measles, and among others have been theories that it is dependent on the proportion of susceptibles to immunes, the topography and rate of spread in an urban unit, the dispersal or concentration of the population, the possibility of latent immunisation arising from sub-clinical attacks, or the periodic fluctuation in the infecting power of the virus. One of the most complete studies of the problem is a fifteen year review of cases occurring in the Isle of Wight by Dr. C.G.M. Nicol of the Ministry of Health. He points out that, after the first months of life, susceptibility to measles is probably nearly one hundred per cent. It is not "immunity" which protects the under-fives collectively, but absence of exposure to infection. With school entry the chances of thorough exposure to infection become greatly increased. He concludes that it is the fiveand six-year old groups which provide the material for the spread of epidemics of measles, and themselves bring each epidemic to an end when a sufficient proportion has had the disease. As long as the percentage who have had measles remains under 30, there is little evidence of a general group protective effect. Once the percentage reaches 40, there does seem to be an over-all protective effect both in interrupting the course of the outbreak and in leaving some residual protection to be carried forward to the following year. If the percentage of recorded cases passes 70, the residual effect appears to last for two years or possibly longer. The following is taken from Dr. Nichol's article in the Ministry of Health's Bulletin for July, 1956:- "Another possible explanation, and a very simple one, is that each local epidemic ends by the combined effect of several rather obvious factors; the number of close contacts of each case is limited, even among school children, and becomes very sharply limited as soon as the child is isolated at home; the spread of the disease through a school or classroom begins to empty the classes, reduce the degree of crowding together and the ease of spread by propinquity and sooner or later each case of measles is ringed round by a circle of immunes, when the outbreak must end from lack of sufficient susceptibles in close enough contact with sources of infection. If this explanation is correct, it follows that the higher the proportion of immunes already present in the age group, the sooner will the chain of spread be broken. From the Isle of Wight data, it appears that 40 per cent. immunity in the 5and 6-year old groups is enough to interrupt the paths of spread of measles." "If this surmise is correct, each epidemic as it ends still leaves many susceptibles whom it has failed to reach. Some of these develop measles in later years, occasionally in old age the oldest notified case in the Island series was aged 72 but an appreciable number in each age group appear to escape the disease (or to escape notification)." 78 "...it would seem that there are, scattered throughout the different age groups, a considerable number of children who have never had measles, and over the years the proportion of susceptibles accumulates. Sooner or later the year arrives when each successive separate focus of measles is no longer surrounded by a closing ring of immunes but only by yet more susceptibles. In such circumstances, an exceptionally large epidemic might be expected." "...Outbreaks of measles do not end from the exhaustion of the supply of all further susceptibles but from lack of susceptibles in the immediate circle of individual sufferers. When the outbreak has run its course and a sufficient number of foci (cases) has become 'ringed off® by immunes, the outbreak ends, usually quite suddenly." "Where the age groups on which the threatened outbreak presses most heavily already contains 30 per cent. or more children who have previously had measles, the ring of immunes round each case is already partly present and rapidly becomes complete, this being the position in 'non-epidemic' years." "Where the percentage reaches 70 in 5and 6-year olds and is proportionately high in the adjoining groups, measles may fail to get any real foothold at all, and there is no 'outbreak'." "As long as the percentage remains below 45 in the 5 8s there is always the chance that circumstances may favour widespread linking of infection, finding the 'gaps' in the very incomplete circle of immunes round each case instead of meeting a reasonably solid wall of immunity. This would explain the occasional 'epiphenomenal' epidemic of measles." This would appear to be the case in Kensington in the year of writing, when the total number of notifications in the current epidemic has already reached 1,632, exceeding the highest epidemic number since notifications began by nearly 400. In my Annual Report for 1950 I reproduced a graph showing the incidence in four-weekly periods during the preceding ten years. This graph has now been continued to 1960, and it will be seen that the number of cases notified, regularly continues to rise to a maximum at intervals of two years. Ophthalmia Neonatorum Six cases were notified to me during 1960. Pour of these occurred at the patients' homes. The other two were cases occurring in Kensington hospitals and were infants whose parents were not normally resident in the borough. All the patients fully recovered with no impairment to vision. Gastro-enteritis This disease is notifiable in children up to the age of five years. The number of cases reported during the year was 9. Six were removed to hospital for treatment. One death of a child under five years of age (not a notified case) was recorded as due to "gastritis, enteritis or diarrhoea" in 1960. Scabies The number of scabies notified during 1960 was 28, which compares with 463 notified in the peak year of 1946. Tuberculosis During the year 164 new cases of tuberculosis were notified, of which 147 were respiratory and 17 non-respiratory. 79 The following table shows the number of cases added to and the number removed from the notification register during the year:- Description Respiratory NonRespiratory Total M F M F On register of notifications on 1st January, 1960 851 698 74 98 1721 Notified for the first time during the year 76 71 5 12 164 Brought to notice other than by notification 99 78 3 7 187 Removed from register on account of having - (a) recovered from the disease 55 43 2 5 105 (b) removed from district, lost sight of, etc. 167 139 10 13 329 (c) died 14 7 1 1 23 Remaining on register on 51st December, 1960 790 658 69 98 1615 The system of investigation into the environmental conditions of tuberculosis patients continued during the year. All newly notified cases and those cases transferring into Kensington or changing their address in the borough, have been visited by the public health inspectors with the object of tracing the source of infection, preventing the spread of infection and removing conditions favourable to infection. Particular attention was given to the home conditions in addition to the dissemination of advice to prevent the transmission of infection to contacts. During the year, 374 visits were paid to the homes of tuberculous patients. In 211 of these, the environmental conditions were such as to require no further action on the part of the public health department; in a further 49 cases, it was found that the patients had moved away; and in 47 other cases the investigations were postponed as the patients were away in hospital or had not been contacted by the end of the year. The action taken in the remaining 67 cases is summarised as follows:- Action taken Cases Investigation or supervision undertaken in respect of:- (a) re-arrangement of existing accommodation 2 (b) occupation of patients 4 (c) tracing of contacts 4 (d) prevention of spread of infection 39 Recommended for priority rehousing 8 Action taken under Public Health and Housing Acts in respect of insanitary or unhealthy conditions 10 80 Incidence of tuberculosis amongst Kensington residents who originated from areas outside England, Scotland and Wales. In my Annual Report for 1951, attention was drawn to what appeared to be a disturbing trend in the incidence of tuberculosis amongst immigrants. Since 1952, a more detailed investigation of this problem has taken place and the following table sets out the information found in 1960:- Country of origin Period (in years) between entry to United Kingdom and notification of disease Total 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 British Guiana - 1 - - - - - - - 1 British W.

The difference consisted of old cases changing residence within the borough. In 1951, a full survey was not made, but it was estimated that 20 per cento of the tuberculous patients visited for the first time in that year were immigrants who contracted the disease within ten years of arrival in this country. 81 A more accurate investigation in the following years indicated that, of the new cases and "inward transfers" reported in the borough, the proportions who were immigrants contracting the disease in the first ten years of arrival, were as follow:- Year Proportion per cent. 1952 16 1953 10 1954 16 1955 17 1956 15 1957 16 1958 23 1959 20 1960 20 This year, 39% (1959-43%) of the infected immigrants contracted the disease within one year of arrival in this country; 73% (1959-75%) contracted it within three years of arrival. Persons born in the Republic of Ireland were regarded as immigrants for this purpose. The 1951 Census figures showed that out of a total Kensington population of 168,160, there were 29,353 residents (or just over 17%) who were born outside the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Whooping Cough One hundred and fifty-four cases were notified during the year, eleven of which were treated in hospital. No deaths were reported during 1960. International Certificates In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, certain countries require that visitors should be vaccinated or inoculated against specified diseases. International certificates have been prescribed for smallpox, yellow fever and cholera. When completed by the medical practitioner, the certificates must be authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health. During the year, 3,309 of these certificates were authenticated in Kensington. In addition, 14 special exemption certificates were issued to travellers for use in the United States of America.
