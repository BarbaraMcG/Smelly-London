In the Report of their Surveyor, which is appended hereto, the Vestry have the honor to submit to the Ratepayers of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town the details of those important branches of their proceedings which consist of paving and sewerage works. They show, it is trusted, a steady perseverance in the plan indicated in former reports, of gradually and with due regard to available funds, accomplishing all such improvements as are necessary for the health and convenience of the inhabitants and the public at large. It is the intention of the Vestry, faithfully to adhere to that plan; and, on the one hand, to avoid a false economy which, by present neglect, would aggravate future burdens, and on the other to steer clear of an extravagant outlay which would lead to the necessity of increased local taxation. The Vestry hope they have redeemed the pledge contained in their last Report, that the public would not suffer through the Mile End Road having come under their control as the Local Authority. Its present state, it is submitted, is highly satisfactory and worthy of one of the greatest and most commanding thoroughfares of the Metropolis. It is matter for congratulation that, although its maintenance has entailed serious liability 8 upon the Vestry, and drawn largely upon their resources, the local rates have been kept down to their previous and customary level. The sewarage works, necessary to complete the drainage of the Hamlet, have been under consideration, and the Surveyor has, in pursuance of instructions, submitted details of the requirements, and an estimate of the cost, which await and will receive due deliberation. It is satisfactory to know that, notwithstanding the deplorable state in which the Vestry found the drainage of the district, their steady efforts gradually to supply the defects have been so far successful that it is estimated that an expenditure of between four and five thousand pounds would complete the system. Sanitary measures have, during the year, received due attention; and the rate of mortality prevailing at the different seasons has borne testimony to their efficiency. The following is a list of works, having for their aim the preservation of the public health, which have been carried out in the course of the year:— Cesspools abolished 35 Houses and premises connected with sewers 102 Foul drains cleansed 169 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 27 Traps provided for drains, closets, &c 902 Dust bins provided 95 Premises from which Pigs were removed 14 Houses cleansed and purified 228 The cow houses, slaughter houses, and bakehouses within the Hamlet have been periodically visited and the observance of the sanitary laws enforced. The annual contract for the removal of dust and refuse from the houses was duly entered into. In October last 9 licences for 37 slaughter-houses and 33 cowhouses were granted by the Justices; the propriety of opposing the application in each case having been considered by the Sanitary Committee after an inspection of the premises. The accounts for the year ending 25th March, 1868, were in due course submitted to the Auditors, vouched and allowed. An abstract of them showing the receipts and expenditure of the Vestry, with their assets and liabilities, are appended to this Report. In February last, the remaining instalment of 2000/. upon Mr. Buxton's mortgage of the General Rates became due, and 1000/. on account of it was paid. The payment of the balance, by arrangement with the mortgagee, stands over until February next. The loan was contracted in 1858, for defraying the cost of large paving works which the Vestry found to be urgently required when the Metropolis Management Act came into force. The original amount was 5000/. In March last, the Vestry contracted a loan of 1600/. with the Star Life Assurance Society upon mortgage of the General Rates, for the purpose of meeting a portion of the expenses that will be incurred in the projected improvement of White Horse Lane, the completion of which they hope to bo able to report next year.

REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR to THE VESTRY of THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. REPORT June, 1868. Gentlemen, I have great pleasure in again laying before you a Report of the various works carried out in my department, during the year ending March 25th, 1868. Paving. A total quantity of 32,307 ft. of paving, 15,000 ft. of 3-in. paving, and 17,307, feet of 2½ in. paving have been laid during the year, in Longfellow-road, Burdett-road, Alma-road, Wilson-street, and Salisbury-street. The only portion laid at the total cost of the Vestry was the portion in Burdett-road, which was done under contract by Mr. Druitt. No carriageway pitching has, in any large quantity been laid during the year, as Messrs. Hill and Keddle have not been able to deliver the remaining portion of their contract for the supply of stone from the Holborn Valley. 4 New Streets. During the year, you have paved the footpaths, made up the roadways, and taken under your charge Almaroad, Wilson-street, Salisbury-street, and Longfellowroad. The whole of the works, with the exception of Longfellow-road, have been performed at the cost of the owners of property situate in such streets. The following are tabular statements, shewing the cost of horse hire, labour and materials for the year: ROAD MATERIALS. Year ending March, 1860. Year ending March, 1867. Year ending March, 1868.

Within the last three months, I have been enabled to make an arrangement with the Great Eastern Railway Company to the effect that the whole of the slop which is accumulated on, and taken from, our roads shall be shot in their yard, in Devonshire-street, or loaded into trucks from the carts. By this means our men are enabled to cart four loads per day from any part of the Hamlet; and, in some cases, when the work has been near to the station, as many as seven loads per day have been carted instead of three, as in the case of the slop having to be taken to Stratford. The Railway Company take the sweepings to such parts of their line as may be situated upon heavy clay soil, where, I have no doubt, it will be found to materially enhance the value of the land. It is taken in the empty returned trucks, and all the Company look for, in the way of payment from the person receiving it, is as much as will pay for sending the trucks back when they are empty. At present, the matter is only an experiment, but so far the results have been most satisfactory, the stuff being got rid of as soon as it is ready to move. Should it be found practicable to adopt this mode of disposing of the material during the whole winter, I anticipate being able to report a considerable saving in the cost of horse hire for the current year. During the past year, no less a quantity than 11,867 yards of slop have been taken from the roads of the Hamlet; this cost the sum of 2s. 6½d. per yard for carting, and 3¾d. per yard for loading into the carts. 8 Watering. During the summer season, sixteen water carts were employed on ninety-six days, and cost the sum of £591 12s. for horses and drivers, and the sum of £294 14s. 3d. for 7,186,500 gallons of water. £25 4s. being charged for the uses of meters. Lighting. The lighting of the Hamlet is still satisfactorily done by the Commercial Gas Company, who light 742 lamps, the cost of which, to the Vestry, for gas, lighting and maintenance, was £3191 6s. 7d. No complaint has originated, during the year, either of the supply or quality of the gas. Sewers. New Sewers have been constructed in William-street, North, Essex-street, Robert's-place, and Prince's-street. The whole were executed under the schedule of prices contained in Mr. Finch's contract for jobbing sewer work. , The following Table will shew the length of each description of pipe constructed within the Hamlet during the year:— size of sewer. length consteucted. 1 foot 0 inches by 1 foot 0 inches 800 9 feet 0 inches by 9 feet 0 inches 1140 6 „ 0 „ 6 „ 0 „ 13,260 4 „ 0 „ 4 „ 0 „ 4,420 Two hundred and twenty one houses have been drained into the sewer during the year.

REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION & PUBLIC HEALTH OF Mile End Old Town, for THE YEAR ENDING MARCH the 30th, 1868, by MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Officer of Health. london: T. PENNY, PRINTER, LEMAN STREET. WHITECHAPEL, E. 1868. REPORT. Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to present the usual Annual Report as required under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Government Act. The Report contains the vital statistics of the Hamlet, for the year ending March 28th, 1868, together with a summary of the proceedings in the health department of the Vestry during the year. I have also made such brief remarks upon some of the subjects as I have thought necessary in the interest of the public health. I have endeavoured so to arrange the tables that you may readily understand the various subjects to which they refer. It is gratifying to observe that the public health, judged by the rate of mortality for the year, has been most satisfactory, and if we go further and compare the mortality of the Hamlet with that of the five great divisions of the metropolis, the result is, in every case, in our favour. (See Table IV.) I have appended the Sanitary Inspector's Report, showing the number of principal nuisances abated or removed. 4 Epidemic Diseases. Wherever epidemic disease has assumed serious proportions, the houses have been visited and the necessary measures directed to stay the progress of the disease. To ensure early information of the existence of such disease, I have obtained weekly, from the books of the Union Medical Officers, the names and addresses of the patients in all such cases which come under their notice. Table III. shows the deaths from epidemic or preventable diseases to have been, during the year ending March last, more than 100 below the average of the five previous years, and taking the increase of the population into consideration, the proportionate mortality from these diseases would be still lower. There has been much less fever than during the previous year; it prevailed to a considerable extent in Essex Street, in the West Ward, during October and November last, but by a prompt inspection of every house, and the issue of orders to cleanse and purify, and other sanitary measures which were effectually carried out, the epidemic was speedily suppressed, and I, believe, there is now less epidemic disease in the West than in any other Ward in the Hamlet, except the North. It is this class of diseases which it is in our power to control and prevent by Sanitary measures, and that they are so amenable experience has placed beyond question. An illustration of the wisdom and economy in the liberal adoption of such measures, will probably produce an impression which, in my experience, no argument or theory, however convincing, has yet effected. Daring the year ending March, 1868, there were 93 fever and 14 smallpox cases sent to the hospitals, at a 5 cost to the Hamlet of 2s, 4d. a day for each patient; presuming the average time these patients remained in hospital to have been a month; this charge alone would amount to £349 10s. 8d., but there are concomitant charges arising directly from the same source—16 children were known to have been taken into the workhouse in consequence of parents, included among these patients, having been sent to the fever Hospital; take the cost of maintenance at 7s. a week each child, and the period they remain in the Workhouse at six weeks, this charge would amount to £33 12s.—this is a moderate estimate for this item, because, in the event of the death of parents, some of the children would remain a permanent charge. Again, say 50 of the 107 patients require relief for a fortnight after leaving the Hospital before procuring work, at 5s. a week each or £25, making a total of £408 2s. 8d., as the cost to the ratepayers for a small section, "one fifteenth," of those diseases which science proves are susceptible of prevention. The statistics refer solely to the sick poor who come under the care of the Union Medical Officers. These gentlemen attended during the year, 6959 new cases, out of which 1-552 were of the epidemic class; to all these 1552 cases, less the 107 more important and costly cases discussed, we may fairly assign a charge "one fourth" the amount estimated for the Hospital cases or about £1445, making, with the £408 2s. 8d., £1,853 2s. 8d., or in round numbers about £2,000 of the rates for the care and treatment of these preventable diseases among those of the poor alone who come under the cognizance of the Parish Authorities, the large majority of the patients being treated at their own houses; in many instances families have to be maintained during illness of parents—all this is exclusive of the 6 money loss, which is of course, incalculable, and the loss of health and life ensuing from the spread of these diseases throughout all classes of the community from their original source among the poorest. It is sufficiently evident from this brief exposition that we have here one of the principal charges upon the poors' rate, and it is unnecessary to supplement such facts with any remarks as to the better economy of preventing, at a nominal cost, that which entails such a large outlay to combat and remedy. It is my deliberate opinion that if all the provisions of sanitary legislation, since the passing of the Local Management Act, had been earnestly applied from the commencement, there would not have been any necessity for the costly Institutions now in course of projection for the reception and treatment of epidemic diseases in the metropolis. Tlio Sanitary Committee framed and recommended for adoption by the Yestry, certain regulations under clause 35 of the Public Health Act of 1866, for the more effectual prevention of epidemic diseases, but the Vestry refused to adopt them, considering the general powers of the Act sufficient in this Hamlet to effect the objects in view. Exhalations from human excreta and refuse are the chief causes of these diseases. Defective and deficient drainage and absence of any effectual system of sewer ventilation are, therefore, in the highest degree inimical to the public health, and, until a successful principle of sewer ventilation is discovered and applied, the main drainage of the 7 polis will continue to be, in its relation to the public health, a comparative failure. By the present method of sewer ventilation, the atmosphere immediately above the surface of the roads and streets is, especially in summer, soon after sun set, not much better than that in the sewers themselves; and it is only by observing the greatest care in trapping and managing sinks, that sewer gases can now be prevented impregnating the interior of houses—the communication being direct with the sewers. This care is only exercised to a sufficient extent by a very few people—in fact, in the absence of a plan by which sewer gases can be rendered innoccuous, destroyed, or carried beyond the distance of doing harm, the old closet system under good and stringent regulations would be preferable. Then, the poisonous emanations arising from the closets were outside, and often at some distance from the dwellings, and the exhalations rendered less dangerous by dilution with the atmosphere. Now, through the medium of sewers and drains, they have a direct communication in a concentrated form with the interior of houses. I conceive it to be my duty to point out to you any circumstances or conditions which I believe specially to affect the public health, and influence the rate of mortality. There are other causes than overcrowding and bad drainage, &c., which, although even still more easily under our control, are neglected. Of what use is it to record the ravages of measles, scarlatina, whooping cough, &c., when we allow their sources and means of propagation to continue without attempt at effective prevention or removal—I allude more especially to the " spreading " causes of these diseases. The most prominent and fertile propagating media are 8 schools and places of summer resort, especially crowded sea-side places; schools, public and private, rank first; and I have no hesitation in saying that two-thirds of the contagious diseases of children, above 4 or 5 years of age, may have their sources of infection traced to schools; this is caused by want of sufficient care and the nonobservance of proper measures to destroy or modify the infectious relics of the diseases in convalescents who are returning to school, and who thus become the sources of infection and death to numbers of others; a minimum interval, before the return to school, should be adopted and insisted upon, and strict supervision in this respect exercised. Holiday resorts during the season contribute largely to the spread of these diseases and the mortality therefrom; nothing is more common than for families of children, in comparatively good health, to be attacked by measles, scarlatina, or diphtheria when visiting such places, especially at the sea-side, either by coming into contact with others who have been ill, or from living in houses by which such have been previously occupied. These are clearly preventable causes—of probably the greatest amount of all others—of disease and mortality among children up to 10 or 12 years of age; and yet there are no prescribed rules—voluntary or compulsory—for guidance, management, and supervision under such circumstances. It should be known that the infecting property remains—more or less, according to the disease—in full activity and virulence for some time after the patient is restored to apparent health ; and it is only by the exercise of great care on the part of parents and principals of schools, and the adoption of proper hygienic 9 measures and rules that the clanger can be limited or removed. Childhood Mortality. Table V. shows the mortality at various ages. It will be seen that nearly half the total deaths occurred between birth and 5 years of age, and the largest proportion during the first year. This excessive childhood mortality is an important social problem, and there can be no doubt but that a great number of children are killed by preventable causes, including—neglect, chronic starvation, improper feeding, and infectious diseases. A great cause for this disproportionate mortality is in the deficient physical power at so early an age to resist the effects of disease; hence, for example, the usual excessive infantile mortality from diarrhoea, which more matured subjects are able to overcome. For the three causes first mentioned, I must confess my belief that there is, at present, only one effectual remedy—that is to rescue the children from the control of those who ought, but who either cannot, or will not, protect them; but who would, I have no doubt, voluntarily entrust them to the charge of the proper authorities that they might be rescued from the misery, cruelty, and the almost inevitable death which must ensue upon the conditions under which they exist. As the law appears at present to be administered, children can only be protected and saved by making their parents "in-door paupers." This system, not to receive children into the Workhouse without their parents, is, I believe, enforced in most parishes, under the supposition that it prevents parents who can, but will not, maintain their children, from throwing them upon the parish; this result is, to say the least, very 10 problematical, and I do not believe in it; but, admitting it to be true, the good derivable would not justify the sacrifice of thousands of lives of children through starvation and disease in carrying it into effect; most of the able-bodied parents have an aversion to become paupers, and feel that, if relieved for a time from the maintenance of their children, they could regain a position to support them. Why should it not be that children, the sick, the infirm, and the aged only should receive relief under the poor laws? The result would be great saving of life and money, and the virtual extinction of able-bodied pauperism, without hardship or injustice to any. It can be readily understood that the great majority of these deaths occur among the children of the poorest classes—a sufficient proof that the conditions I have mentioned are the chief contributing causes. Water Supply. The general supply of water by the East London Company, daring the year, has favourably compared with that of the other Metropolitan Companies. The quantity supplied averaged about 30 gallons per head daily of the population—including that used for manufacturing and other purposes—this would leave about 22 gallons a day for the consumption and use of each individual of the population; but a vast proportion of the water supplied io dwelling houses, especially of the poor, is wasted or otherwise made unavailable by inadequate and defective means of storage; but, by orders of the Vestry, many improvements in this respect have been effected during the year. Many new water butts and cisterns have been provided by landlords, by order of the Vestry, and when the 11 houses in a court,having defective water storage,belonged to one or two landlords, the constant supply system, by means of water waste preventers, has been adopted. The Company offers every facility for extending this system, and is in no way responsible for the wretchedly bad, deficient and dangerous provisions for storing the water in the houses of the poor; rendering it impossible for them to keep their houses clean and healthy, or to have sufficient water for drinking and cooking purposes. On Sundays they are frequently without a drop of water, the Company not giving a supply upon that day, relying upon the extra quantity supplied on Saturdays; but, of course, this is of no avail with the small rotten and riddled tubs provided for the occupants of a whole house, probably ten or twelve in number, and which willnot hold more than sufficient for one or t wo persons; these tubs are generally without taps, and the water has to be taken out. indiscriminately by means of any available domestic utensil. I trust that the Vestry will continue to require,within reasonable, time, a general and efficient improvement in these receptacles. In the better class of houses, especially all modern houses, we find for storage purposes what are called cisterns, generally large enough to hold a proper daily supply for two persons, they are little square boxes lined with metal, and placed over the water closets, through the medium of which they communicate directly with the common sewers, and the impregnation of the water in the cisterns by the sewer gases is usually modified or graduated by means of an ineffective trap; this is frequently out of order, and then there is no interruption to the passage of the gases through the pipe into the cistern, thus completing an infallible plan for the creation and distribution of fever and other diseases, people wondering, the while, whence they have 12 come to them. The wonder should be that we have not more such. These are the only means for storing water under the intermittent supply system, and each is alone used for both domestic purposes and closet supply—there should be a separate and distinct receptacle for each— this objectionable system prevails throughout the Metropolis. I think you will concur with me, that there is an exception to the general immunity of the East London Water Company from blame, when I inform you that it has come to my knowledge that many houses occupied by the very poorest in the Hamlet have been without water for periods varying from one to three months; as examples, I may mention Providence-place in the East, and Essex-street and Johns-place in the West Wards. From enquiries, I ascertained the cause to have been that the water rate had not been paid by the landlords, and consequently the water was ''cut off" by the servants of the Company. This power they legally posses under a clause ot their Act, but they have also the power to pursue the landlord in the County Court, which would prevent the infliction of suffering upon the helpless and non-offending occupiers, and avoid a source of great danger to the healthof the whole community. The people were compelled to beg water from their neighbours who could ill spare it; feeling the risk and peril such a condition must entail upon neighbourhoods where, of all others, we look for—and, indeed, there did then exist—fever and other infectious diseases, I communicated with the Company, informing them of the extreme danger incurred in depriving the people of water, but no water was supplied until the rates were paid, and so these poor people were deprived, for a long period, of one of the first necessaries 13 of life; at the period I allude to there was no scarcity of water. Only a sense of duty has induced me to call your attention to a legal power possessed by the Company which may be again exercised in a way traught with danger to the whole community and great hardship to the immediate sufferers. But, I trust, the same dangerous experiments will not be persisted in in future; of course, the rates of the Company must be paid, but it is rather too much to expedite their payment at the risk of human life, or by compelling the Vestry to become, practically, the public prosecutors or debt collectors to the Company in en forcing their defaulting customers to reinstate the Water supply which has been cut off. Regents Canal. Numerous complaints have been made respecting offensive smells arising from this canal. I procured samples of the water, and the Company supplied me with others taken from the different locks along the course of the canal down to the Thames ; these samples, with the results of the tests I applied, I presented to the Sanitary Committee. As might be expected, the water was much impregnated with decomposed organic matter, but the principal cause of its becoming at times offensive was the system adopted, in times of scarcity of water, in repeatedly re-utilizing the water by pumping it back from one pound to another. I had an interview at the Vestry, with the Engineer to the Company, and he explained that most effectual means were constantly taken to keep the canal clean, and that the system of pumping back and re-using the water would be abolished. 14 Tower Hamlets Cemetery, &c. My attention was again called to the Tower Hamlets Cemetery, by the Government Inspector of Burials, owing to its having been intimated to him that certain presumed irregularities as to the made of burial were there practised. The details of a lengthened investigation were drawn up and presented to you by the Clerk to the Vestry ; the result being satisfactory as regards the public health and the future condition of the Cemetery. The same official also requested my attention to a disused burial ground in Globe-road, upon which houses were being built. I visited the ground with the Government Inspector, and it being evident to us that human remains had been disturbed, and that, in my opinion, building dwellings upon such a place would be dangerous to the public health, measures were adopted by the Government to prevent more houses being built upon the ground. Acts of Parliament. Several Acts and Amendments of Acts relating to the public health have been passed during the present Session of Parliament, they have been brought before and explained to the Vestry by the Clerk—they consist of an Act to amend the Public Health Act of 1866. The Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Bill, and an Act for regulating the hours of labour for children, youngpersons and women employed in workshops, &c. They will require careful consideration as cases arise under their several provisions. 15 It is sufficiently evident that the duties of the Vestry have been and will continue to be increased in immediate relation to the public health. Gas. I have, at frequent intervals, tested the illuminating power of the gas supplied to the Hamlet by the Commercial Gas Company, this, however, has invariably exceeded the power required by the Act of Parliament, and varying from fourteen to sixteen candles. As to its chemical purity, the inadequate means placed at my command for testing it show, it to be of average quality. Manufacturing Nuisances. Of these malt roasting, blood baking, gas manufacturing, and grain drying, are the most prominent, and my attention has been called by complaints of inhabitants to all; of the first, the proprietor evinces a desire to satisfy the requirements of the Sanitary Committee— who have several times visited the premises—by adopting measures to suppress the nuisance arising therefrom, and as such a result can be obtained, it will, no doubt, be accomplished : with regard to the second, situate at Bow Common, much has been done in mitigation, at considerable cost, but more remains to be, and can be, accomplished; with regard to the third, I, upon complaint of unusually offensive smells arising from the gas works, visited the premises of the Commercial Gas Company, but, after a lengthened investigation, could not discover, at the time of my visit, any probable cause of anything exceptionally offensive in excess of that which usually arises from similar works; with regard to the last, "grain drying," extensive and costly 16 ments have been made with a view to prevent the nuisance complained of. It is not necessary that I should, in this Report, give the details of the daily minor duties of this department. In conclusion, I need only congratulate the Vestry upon the very favourable condition of the public health of the Hamlet as compared with other districts in the Metropolis I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, M.
