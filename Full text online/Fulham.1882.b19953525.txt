Loans- The Board during the year ended 31st March, 1883, obtained the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works to the following Loans:— £1000 advanced by the Metropolitan Board of Works for the purpose of purchasing additional Horses and Water Vans at 32 per cent, interest, the amount to be re-paid within five years. £5300 advanced by the Metropolitan Board of Works for Permanent Works, Crossings, Paving, Kerbing and Channelling Works, at 3½ per cent, interest, the amount to be re-paid within fifteen years. Loan £2500. An application has been made to the Metropolitan Board for their sanction for a loan of £2500 for Wood Paving Works in King Street West, from Shaftesbury Road to Young's Corner. Street Nomenclature. By Section 87 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, it becomes the duty of Vestries and District Boards to carry out the orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works for re-naming streets, abolishing subsidiary names, and re-numbering the houses, and in pursuance thereof the Board has carried out the orders of the Metropolitan Board for the following:— For renumbering the houses in Aspenlea Road, Fulham, and abolishing the subsidiary names. For renumbering the houses in Strode Road, Fulham, and abolishing the subsidiary names. For renumbering the houses in Ancill Street, Fulham. For renumbering the houses in Chaldon Road, Fulham. For renumbering the houses in Burlington Road, and abolishing the subsidiary names. For abolishing the subsidiary names, renumbering the houses in Fulham or Union Road from Queen Street, Hammersmith, to High Street, Fulham, and re-naming the whole line "Fulham Palace Road." For abolishing the subsidiary names and renumbering the houses in Percy Road, Shepherd's Bush, from the Starch Green Road to Uxbridge Road. For abolishing the subsidiary names and renumbering the houses in Masboro Road North. For renumbering the houses in Fverington Street, Fulham. For renumbering the houses in Averill Street, Fulham. For renumbering the houses in Delorane Street, Fulham. 20 Pillar Letter Boxes. At th. request of the Post Office Authorities, the Board has, during the year, granted permission for the erection of Pillar Letter Boxes in the following places:— Corner of Charleville and Challoner Roads, Baron's Court Estate. Corner of Munster and Crown Roads, Fulham. Corner of Rylett and Wendell Roads, Starch Green. Weltje Road, Hammersmith. Great Church Lane, Hammersmith. Scrubb Lane, Hammersmith. Cartage Scheme. The work of slopping and watering the roads, general cartage, and the removal of dust, ashes, and domestic refuse, has been carried out during the past year under the direction of the Cartage Committee. The question of finding shoots for the reception of the dust and ashes and slops has greatly occupied the attention of the Committee, and various offers have from time to time been accepted. In Hammersmith a portion of the dust is sold for 1s. 6d. per load, and the slop is disposed of by giving ashes for the permission to shoot slop. In Fulham the Board pays £50 per annum for a shoot at Crabb Tree, by Rowberry Mead (for slop and dust), and has in addition a free shoot on Eelbrook for dust alone. The number of loads of dust removed, and the horses employed during the year is:— Loads of dust removed. Horses employed. Fulham 7841. 1933. Hammersmith 12965. 3266. The question of the number of men employed in the cartage work was referred to tho Committee, and they reported— "That having carefully considered and gone through the list of "men employed on the establishment at the Board's two stable "yards, and having had before them the Superintendent of "Stables, they find that the staff is efficient, but are of opinion "that a more extended system of out-door supervision would "be found beneficial in the working of the scheme. They "have also gone through the weekly returns of the work done "by the horses, and are of opinion that it is not expedient to "make any alteration at present with regard to the journeys "and districts." Subsequently upon their recommendation, in order to enable them to instituto a closer supervion, the Board purchased a nag horse for the use of the Superintendent of Stables, and the result has been satisfactory. 21 The following alterations by casualties, sale, and purchase of live stock have taken place during the year: — 3 horses died from lockjaw 1 horse died from ruptured stomach 1 horse killed by carman 2 horses sold with sidebones 2 horses sold with sprained tendons 1 horse sold with skin disease 16 horses have been purchased during the year at a cost of £1021, being an average of £63 16 3 per horse. The total number of horses now in the Board's stables is 53 cart horses and 4 nag horses. This shews an increase of 6 horses on the establishment as compared with last year. The value of the horses as per Horse Register, including the nags, is £3737 12s. The following is the total consumption of fodder for the year: — Oats 1048¼ Quarters Beans 33½ ,, Bran 24.16 Clover 851/8 Loads Hay 24¾-3/6 ,, Straw 1352/3 ,, Mixture 31¾ ,, Linseed 3½ Quarters The total cost of the above supply was £2412 0s. 8½d., being an average of 16s. 9d. per week for each horse.

In consequence of certain information received by the Clerk, from Mr. W. P. J ones, the Fulham Superintendent, as to the death of one of the horses, No. 43 (black gelding), on Saturday, 28th October last, he (the Clerk) caused a post mortem examination to be held on the Sunday morning which he attended, and, on the result of that examination, applied to the Police to take the carman (Thomas Sands), into custody, charging him with unlawfully and maliciously killing the said horse, and later in the day the carman was apprehended. Sands was brought before the Magistrate and by him committed for trial. He was tried at the Middlesex Sessions on Thursday, 9th November, and sentenced to nine months hard labour. It is hoped that the example thus made will act as a deterrent upon the men employed by the Board, and assist in making them more amenable to discipline, which it is found very difficult to enforce among this class of men. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The Board, in July 1881, re-appointed Mr. E. H. Davies as Public Analyst for this District, and a Summary of the various articles of food submitted to him for analysis, with the result of the examination, will be found annexed (see Appendix No. 5 ). There is still great difficulty in obtaining convictions in cases of adulterated milk, as evidenced in the case of the prosecution instituted against Walter Townshend, of 1, Estcourt Boad, Fulham, the Analyst's Certificate stating the sample to consist of:— Milk (of average quality)—92 parts Added water 8 ,, and notwithstanding the fact that this was Townshend's second offence (he having been cautioned on the 5th April, 1882), the Magistrate dismissed the summons with two guineas costs against the Board. Walter Rodway, of 1, Raynham Road, Hammersmith, was summoned for refusing to sell milk to the Inspector for the purpose of Analysis, and the person in charge of the shop (Defendant's Wife) admitted that she refused to serve upon the ground that she had no milk to spare. Although the refusal to serve was fully proved, this summons was dismissed by the Magistrate. Survey of the District. The Board has had under consideration for some considerable time the necessity of having a complete and correct map of the district, shewing all the alterations that have taken place since the formation of the Board in the year 1856. The matter is before the Works Committee to enquire and report as to the best mode of carrying it out. The Committee have not yet been able to present a report thereon. 25 Public Mortuary. As stated in the last report, this matter war, referred to a Special Committee to make enquiries as to the cost of erection and maintenance of a Public Mortuary for the District. The Committee reported that they had made enquiries as to sites suitable for the erection of a public Mortuary, and had been in negotiation with the Hammersmith Burial Board for the purchase of a piece of land on the south side of the Superintendent's Lodge, at the Hammersmith Cemetery, Margravine Road. On the 18th October, 1882, the following letter was read:— Burial Board Office, 3. The Grove, Hammersmith Dear Sir, Land for Public Mortuary. I am directed by the Burial Board to inform you that the Board, subject to the approval of the Vestry, and to the carrying out of the plan submitted to the Board and dated 8th August, 1882, agrees to sell, for the sum of £875, to the Board of Works for the Fulham District, for the purpose of a public Mortuary, the land on the South side of the Superintendent's Lodge, Margravine Road, and marked pink on the plan dated 9th October, 1882." This offer the Board accepted, subject to the terms of a contractl to be approved, excluding the conditions contained in the Burial Board's letter relating to the carrying out of certain plans dated 9th October, 1882. This was communicated to the Burial Board, who adhered to their resolution so far as selling the land for the purpose of erecting a public Mortuary (and for no other purpose whatever), and in consenting to modify the condition as to carrying out certain plans, they required that plans of any proposed buildings should be submitted for their approval. The matter was again referred to the Committee and they reported that they were of opinion that the further consideration of the matter should be adjourned, pending the action likely to be taken by the Government with regard to the Local Government of the Metropolis. By permission of the Fulham Board of Guardians the Mortuary attached to the Fulham Union has been used, but the Guardians have now given notice that the permission will be discontinued, and the Board has fitted up a portion of a building at the wharf. Queen's Road, Chancellors, Hammersmith, as a Temporary Mortuary, and the matter is referred to the Works Committee to consider and report to the Board as to the provision of a permanent Building. D. 26 Chalet de Toilette. The Chalet now erected at the Eastern End of Shepherd's Bush is open to the public, and is believed to be a great boon to the persons who visit Shepherd's Bush Green, and the neighbourhood. Wood Lane and Scrubb Lane. Line of Thoroughfare from Uxbridge Road to Harrow Road. As stated in the last report certain negotiations were in progress with the owners of land abutting upon this line of thoroughfare which negotiation the Board is happy to report have been brought to successful issue and a certain amount of the work has been carried out. The only portion now remaining to be done is the length of road across the Scrubbs, for which work the Metropolitan Board of Works are about inviting Tenders, when this is finished the whole line of thoroughfare from the Harrow Eoad to Uxbridge Eoad will be open for traffic. Paving of New Streets. Under the provisions of the 18 & 19, Victoria cap. 120, 25 & 26, Vic., cap. 102, the Board has during the year taken to the following "New Streets." HAMMERSMITH. Boscombe Road Fielding Road Masboro' Road North (continuation) Melina Road (sec. 2) Augustus Road Carthew Road Brackenbury Road (sec. 2) Scrubbs Lane Goodwill Road Findon Road Hazlitt Road Shepherd s Bush Road (sec 1) Gratton Road Cobbold Road Beaconsfield Terrace Road Maclise Road Becklow Road Gayford Road Leysfield Road Cross Road Greenside Road Davisville Road (otherwise Batstone Street FULHAM.

Negotiations were entered into between the Board and the Company, and the Board secured the insertion in the Bill of certain protective clauses. See "Parliamentary Notices." Hammersmith BridgeTenders for the reconstruction of Hammersmith Bridge were obtained by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Tender of Messrs. Vernon and Ewens, for the sum of £74,920 was accepted. Upon subsequent enquiry by the Clerk during the recess, it was found that the Metropolitan Board proposed to close the bridge for a period of two years and that Ferry Boats would be provided for the accommodation of foot passengers during that time — no provision being made for the vehicular traffic. f he Clerk thereupon caused a return to be taken of the actual amount of traffic passing over the Bridge, a copy of which is annexed— PROPOSED CLOSING OF HAMMERSMITH BRIDGE.

Hammersmith, 18th Sept., 1882. T. E. JONES. Upon the reassembling of the Board, steps were at once taken to place the matter formally before the Metropolitan Board of "Works and the following Memorial was presented— TO THE HONOURABLE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. The humble Memorial of the Board of Works for the Fulham District. SHEWETH, That your Memorialists have heard with the deepest alarm of the proposal of your honourable Board to stop up Hammersmith Bridge during the progress of the alterations and new works about to be carried out there, and to provide for the traffic a service of Ferry Boats as described in the specification in the following manner. Extract of Specification of Works. FERRY BOATS. 6. Previous to the Contractor commencing any work of demolition that might endanger, hinder, or obstruct the foot traffic over the bridge. he shall supply upon the site of the works two large ferry row boats, perfectly safe and stable, for the use of twelve full grown persons; and to enable passengers to embark and disembark with facility and convenience, shall provide two inclined timber stagings, moveable on two wheels with broad tires. The framework of the stagings shall be strong and light, and capable of being rapidly moved on either foreshore. 7. Each ferry boat shall be under the sole charge and guidance of two certificated Thames boatmen. 8. The boats shall, throughout the day, between the hours of sunrise and sunset, simultaneously cross the river between the stageings aforementioned, allowing regular intervals between the crossings of ten minutes, and at such times during the night as may from time to time be specified by the Engineer. 9. The ferry boats shall cross the river Thames, as described, every day in the year, and for as long a period as the condition of the contract works may render it necessary for the accommodation of foot traffic. No crossings to be permitted during the prevalence of thick fog or floating ice. 10. The Contractor shall take every precaution desirable to ensure the safety of the passengers embarking and leaving the ferry boats, and he shall be entirely responsible for any accidents which 29 may result from mismanagement or want of proper precautionary measures. 11. The Contractor shall supply for the rowing of the ferry boats three gangs of four men each, and they are to relieve each other in the manner that may prove to be most convenient. 12. An additional boatman shall, during the continuance of the daily service of ferry boats, be constantly in attendance upon each shore to assist the arrival and departure of the boats. 13. A policeman shall, during the working hours of the ferry, be stationed at the expense of the Contractor near the moveable stagings upon each shore for the maintenance of order and the regulation of traffic. That your Memorialists have caused to be registered certain statistics, and desire to call the attention of your honourable Board to the large amount of traffic now passing over the Bridge. That during the seven days, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th. 14th, 15th and 16th September, there passed over the Bridge, between the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 p.m., 86,595 foot passengers, and 11,090 vehicles of all descriptions. This includes one day (15th) when there was an important Boat Race rowed, but even if that one day be entirely eliminated from the return it is found that the day traffic for six days only amounts to 54,434 foot passengers and 8,705 vehicles; while the return for two days (24 hours each), Wednesday, 13th, and Thursday, 14tl, give 13,830 foot passengers and 2,965 vehicles. Taking the working hours of the Ferry Boats at 12½ hours per day, that being the period from sunrise to sunset, they would have conveyed in the six days above referred to, 10,800 foot passengers only, leaving 43,634 persons unprovided for, and no provision at all is mace for the 8,705 vehicles passing during the same period- Your Memorialists believe that it is only necessary for them to draw the attention of your honourable Board to the foregoing figures in order to secure a reconsideration of the matter, with a view to the construction of a Temporary Bridge capable of accommodating the large traffic now using Hammersmith Bridge. Your Memorialists therefore pray that your honourable Board will take the necessary steps for causing the erection of a temporary bridge for the accommodation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic before stopping the public highway over Hammersmith Bridge. The Metropolitan Board at once acknowledged the importance of the matter, admitted the necessity of providing accommodation for such traffic, and resolved to promote a Bill in Parliament 30 enabling them to construct a temporary Bridge with proper approaches during the reconstruction of Hammersmith Bridge.—("See Parliamentary Notice,") Fulham Bridge. The preliminary works in connection with the new bridge are in a forward state. The new temporary aqueduct has been constructed by Messrs. Appleby Brothers at a cost of £10,256 2s. 9d, and the watermains have been laid by Messrs J. Aird & Son, for the sum of £7429, less an amount of £l500 to be allowed by them for the said mains when the new bridge is completed. The formation of the Northern and Southern Abutment Dams, and the erection of the temporary staging is in progress and the old aqueduct is being removed. Incidence of Local Taxation. Delegates from the several Vestries and District Boards held a conference as to the advisability of initiating legislation upon this subject with the object of relieving occupiers of houses and lands from the undue burdens they now bear for Public Elementary Education, Poor Law Charges, Metropolitan Board of Works Pates, and such like purposes, and Memorials to the first Lord of the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Home Secretary, were prepared and sealed by the Board. (Copy Memorial.) THE RIGHT HON. SIR WILLIAM VERNON HARCOURT. Knt., M.P,, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department. The Memorial of the Board of Works for the Fulham District in the County of Middlesex, under their Common Seal. SHEWETH—That the heavy and continually increasing burden of local taxation has compelled your Memorialists to give the subject their serious consideration. That the number of objects for which local rates are levied has been augmented of late years. That some of the purposes for which these rates are raised are far from being exclusively local, but are, to a considerable extent, national in character. That these rates are all, without distinction, assessed only on occupied houses and lands to the exclusion of every other kind of property. That your Memorialists fully recognise the liability of occupiers of houses and lands to bear their fair share of local taxation, but they respectfully submit that the mode now in existence of raising money for expenditure under the Elementary Education Acts, for the Metropolitan Board of Works Rates, for the various objects coming under the head of poor Rates, and for such like purposes, operates unfairly and inequitably. 31 That many people at present pay comparatively little or nothing in proportion to their means, towards public elementary education (which, if anything can be, is a grand national object); the cost thereof, with the exception of a grant from Government, and of the fees of the scholars, being borne entirely by the occupiers of houses and lands. That in the opinion of your Memorialists it is only equitable that all persons should contribute, according to their ability, to matters or things for the benefit and welfare of the community at large, and that the rateable value of houses, &c., upon which local taxation is now based, is no fair test of such ability. Your Memorialists therefore humbly pray that you will be pleased to take the subject of the Incidence of Local Taxation into your serious consideration, and move the Legislature, at an early date, to adopt such measures as may be expedient to relieve the occupiers of houses and lands from the undue burdens above referred to, by an equitable system of raising the funds for defraying expenditure of that description. And your Memorialists will ever pray, &c. Gates and Bars across Streets. The Board has, from time to time, had under consideration the obstruction caused by Gates and Bars across streets and roads, and the following petition was presented to Parliament on the subject:— TO THE HONORABLE THE COMMONS OF GREAT BRITAIN AND) IRELAND, IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED The Humble Petition of the Board of Works for the Fulham District, in the County of Middlesex, under their Common Seal, SHEWETH—That your Petitioners have had brought to their notice very many examples of the inconvenience, annoyance, and even danger caused by Gates and Bars being placed across public thoroughfares in the Metropolis. Persons on their way to keep important business engagements, or summoned suddenly into the Country, have been stopped on their way to the Railway Stations. Mourning Equipages have been prevented from passing, and even the Carts employed in Removal of the Dust and Dirt from the Houses and Streets and Fire Engines have had to make their way round other streets to avoid being stopped. Frequent quarrels arise with the keepers of the Gates, sometimes resulting in serious injury, and even in loss of life. That your Petitioners feel sure that your Honorable House will agree that this state of things is not consistent with the spirit of 32 the pres3nt age, however much the inhabitants of London half a century ago may have failed to recognize the importance of free communications, and were therefore indifferent to the establishment of such obstructions. That your petitioners are unanimously of opinion that it is desirable that the Gates and Bars should be removed, and the Streets and Thoroughfares made free. That your Petitioners are of opinion that notwithstanding the difficulties which have presented themselves heretofore, the present is an opportune time for the re-consideration of the question, inasmuch as recently large sums of money have been spent for freeing the Bridges over the Thames, and for the opening up of new and widening of old thoroughfares, to meet the continually increasing requirements of the Metropolis. Moreover tne continuance of these Grates and Bars is daily becoming more anomalous, as the public are thereby deprived of the full advantage of the large expenditure above referred to, as well as that expected from the abolition of turnpikes, and the cost of maintaining turnpike roads being thrown upon the parishes. That your Petitioners have considered the subject in connection with the general question of the dedication to the public of new streets and thoroughfares in the Metropolis, and are of opinion that the point is one which deserves the careful attention of your Honorable House with a view that not only the present obstructions may be removed, but that your Honorable House may give power to Local Authorities to prevent the erection of similar obstructions in new Streets. That your Petitioners have also considered the most important objection to the removals of Bars and Gates, namely, that the quietude of the neighbourhoods so protected would be destroyed if the gates were removed, and that the inhabitants would therefore be entitled to compensation from the Owners of the Estates, and through them from the public; and moreover, that many persons would leave their houses, and the rateable value of the property would be depreciated. Your Petitioners are, however, of opinion that the principle of free thoroughfares should not be sacrificed because it may be necessary in certain cases to make compensation and as to the other point, your Petitioners believe that in some cases the removal of Gates and Bars, would improve the rateable value of the property by opening up new business thoroughfares. That your Petitioners believe that the question is one which must sooner or later be dealt with by Parliament; and as at the present time the public are being heavily rated for important improvements in the street communications of the Metropolis, it seems that immediate attention should be given to the opening up of existing thoroughfares of great value—which can be done without the 33 destruction of property—and by simply removing these Bars and Gates. Your Petitioners, therefore, pray that your Honorable House will take such action as your Honorable House may see fit,for the removal of all Gates and Bars from the streets and thoroughfares of the Metropolis, and for preventing the election of similar obstructions in the future, where the cost of paving, lighting, cleansing, maintaining, and sewering such streets and thoroughfares is defrayed out of the rates. And your petitioners will ever pray, Sealed by Order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. The Board, also asked the Metropolitan Board of Works to make provision in one of their Bills before Parliament next session, to enable this Board to remove brick walls and other obstructions erected across roads, streets and places in the district, all parties injured to be fairly compensated. In reply, the Metropolitan Board say, that taking into consideration all the circumstances, they do not consider it desirable to comply with this Board's request at present. Line of Frontage, Shepherd's Bush Road, Quadrant Buildings. The attention of the Board having been called to the buildings in Shepherd's Bush Road at the corner of Blythe Lane (north side) the Board requested the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board to define the line of frontage between Netherwood road and Dewhurst road. This having been done, it was found that the buildings in question projected beyond the line of buildings and as the sanction of the Metropolitan Board had never been asked for, nor obtained, the Board called upon the owners to remove the said buildings. Negociations were however entered into and an agreement was made, by which the owners undertook to take down and set back the face of the house adjoining the Wesleyan Chapel to a line as defined upon a plan prepared, viz., six feet from the north corner of the then existing building to a point at the South corner, and to give up the land to the public, and the work has since been carried out. Brook Green. The Board after prolonged negociation with the Metropolitan Board, has been instrumental in securing the eulargement and improvement of this open space The Metropolitan Board, in answer to the reiterated appeals of this Board, agreed to purchase a certain portion of the building 34 land abutting on the north side of the Green and add it to the open space upon condition that this Board undertook to construct and maintain a new road on the north of the enlarged green and to construct a sewer for the drainage of the said road, and also to take the necessary steps for stopping up the centre road and cross roads which would not be required when the new road was made. The Board entered into an agreement for carrying into effect the said stipulations. The new road is nearly completed and the necessary application has been made to the Justices for the stopping up of the old road. Electric Lighting. The Board, in common with other local authorities throughout the kingdom, has devoted considerable time and attention to the subject of Electric Lighting. Shortly before the passing of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, the Board entered into a preliminary agreement with a local company, "The West Middlesex Electric Lighting Company, Limited," for the supply of electricity to this district upon certain conditions. After the passing of the act the company gave notice of their intention to apply for a license, and long negotiations ensued as to the terms and conditions to be inserted for the protection of the public interests. Ultimately, satisfactory terms were arranged, and the Draft License is now under the consideration of the Board of Trade, Cab Radius, The Board, in conjunction with other local Boards in the Metropolis, communicated with the Home Secretary with a view to getting the present Cab Radius extended, but the Home Secretary replied "that after consultation with the Commissioner of Police, he is of opinion that an extension is not desirable." Delegates from several Vestries and District Boards have been appointed and now have under consideration the best means to be adopted for obtaining an extension of the radius, and it is hoped that they will be able shortly to bring about the desired alteration. Improvements. The Board, in May, 1882, asked the Metropolitan Board of Works to include in one of their Bills before Parliament provision to empower this Board to purchase property for widening and improving Brook Green Road. King Street West, from the Creek to Hampshire Hog Lane, King's Road by the Lord Palmerston, P H. Also provision empowering the Board to purchase property in order to make a new road from Queen Street to Fulham Palace Road, and also provision to empower the Board to remove brick walls and other obstructions across roads, streets, and places in the district. 35 In reply, the Metropolitan Board informed the Board that they did not consider it desirable to comply with such requests, but as will be apparent upon reference to the Street Improvements Bill, the Metropolitan Board has applied to Parliament for power to widen a portion of Brook green Road, and the Board hopes at a later period to bring about the other improvements. King Street East and Thomas's Place. The Board also asked the Metropolitan Board to carry out the widening of a portion of King street East and King Street West (Thomas's Place), as Metropolitan Improvements, and has the satisfaction of informing the Ratepayers that the Metropolitan Board resolved to apply to Parliament for power to widen to 60 feet the portion of King Street East between the Broadway, and a point opposite the Roman Catholic Convent, at the cost of the Ratepayers of the whole Metropolis. (See " Parliamentary Notices." With regard to Thomas's place, the Metropolitan Board say that after carefully considering the matter, they are unable to regard this proposed improvement as one which should be undertaken at the cost of the Metropolis at large. At the time of making the application to the Metropolitan Board returns were taken of the traffic passing the West London Hospital with the following result.—During twenty-four hours, from 10 o'clock p.m. on Wednesday the 11th October, 1882, to 10 o'clock p.m. on Thursday, the 12th, there passed 3735 vehicles and 21,623 foot passengers. Bridge over the Creek. Having regard to the dangerous condition of the Bridge over the Creek, the Board deemed it necessary that a new Bridge should be constructed and plans were prepared by the Surveyor, and the matter was referred to the Works Committee to obtain tenders for the crrrying out the Works. Tenders were obtained, and the works have been carried out at a cost of £445 5s. 7d. The Metropolitan Board of Works has agreed to contribute one half of the nett cost. St. Ann's Road. Having received complaints as to the condition of St Ann's Road, a portion of which is in the parish of Kensington, the Board has been in communication with the Kensington Vestry upon the subject, and application has been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, under Sec. 140, 18 & 19 Vict. Cap 120, to make an order to place the road under the exclusive management of this Board or of the Kensington Vestry. The Metropolitan Board has not yet come to any decision thereon. Queen Street Improvement. The re-building of the Parish Church has afforded the Board an 36 opportunity for re-opening this question and endeavouring to carry out the long-needed widening of Queen Street. Negotiations wore entered into with the church authorities as to acquiring a strip of land off the churchyard about 250 feet long by 12 foot wide, so as to widen the road to 45 feet, and the Board agreed to purchase the land for the sum of £1500, upon certain conditions, the said sum to include the expense of any application by the Vicar and Churchwardens or other parties for a faculty or any other proceeding for obtaining authority for the sale, the expense attending the moving of any bodies or coffins or other works required to comply with the faculty or other authority, and the cost of erecting wall and iron railing enclosing the now boundary line of the churchyard. The Metropolitan Board have agreed to contribute the sum of £600 towards the cost of the improvement, and application has been made to them to grant the Board a loan for £900, the remainder. So soon as the faculty is obtained the works will be proceeded with, and the Board hopes that before many more weeks are passed the Improvement will bo completed. Traffic returns were taken with result as follows:— Foot Passengers. Vehicles. From 7. a.m. to 10 p.m. on Monday, January 29th, 1883 11,105 1944 Tuesday ,, 30th, ,, 10,524 2183 Wednesday ,, 31st, ,, 9755 2113 Thursday, February 1st ,, 9469 2089 Friday, ,, 2nd ,, 7094 2090 Saturday, ,, 3rd ,, 14,412 2031 Total for 6 days 62,359 12,450 High Street, Fulham, Improvement. The Board has long had under consideration the desirability of improving the entrance to High Street, Fulham. at a point opposite London Road, and an offer being received from the free holder after negociations, to sell his freehold interest in Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 10a, High Street, further negociations were entered into, and the Board resolved to acquire the premises and to carry out the Improvement at a cost of £2100. The property was acquired, the houses pulled down, the road has been widened, and a great improvement has boon effected. The Board is about to sell the surplus land, and expects to receive half the net cost of the improvement from the Metropolitan Board, and a loan for the remainder. Crown Road Improvement. The enormously increasing traffic between Fulham and Hammer - 37 smith, via Crown road, rendered it desirable to improve the entrance to Crown road, from the Fulham Palace road, and the corner plot of land being for sale it was purchased by the Board, and a bell mouth entrance to Crown road has been made. The Board is about to sell the surplus land, and expects to receive from the Metropolitan Board a contribution of one half the net cost. Action against the Manbre Saccharine Company. The Board having received repeated complaints from a large number of ratepayers in Queen street and Fulham road of a nuisance alleged to proceed from the works of the Manbre Saccharine Company, commenced an action in the Chancery division to restrain the Company from carrying on the manufacture of sugar in such a way as to occasion a nuisance to the public. The Company subsequently expended a large sum of money in alterations and improvements in their machinery and apparatus and for a period of several months the nuisance was stopped and the proceedings would have then been stayed had not the works again for a time become a nuisance. The action having been transferred to the Queen's Bench Division came on for trial in April, 1883, before Lord Chief Justice Coleridge and a special Jury, when after five days hearing the Jury found by their verdict that the Company had never caused any nuisance. This was directly in conflict with the evidence of more than twenty witnesses of standing, resident in the neighbourhood, most of whom had visited the Company's works and identified the stench at such works as the same stench which constituted the nuisance which they and their neighbours complained of, and in conflict with the evidence of medical and scientific witnesses who proved the detrimental nature of the emanations from the Company's works. Nuisance at Hammersmith Station—Manufacture of Gas. In the last annual report reference was made to the action taken by the Board in the Chancery Division against the Metropolitan Railway Company, and it was reported that on the trial of the action Mr Justice Chitty granted a perpetual injunction restraining the Company from manufacturing or permitting to be manufactured and from using or permitting to be used, Gas at or near the Broadway station in such a manner as to be or create a nuisance to the public. In consequence of this injunction the Company for some months discontinued the manufacture of Gas at the Station, but afterwards having made some alterations in their machinery they recommenced the manufacture in October, 1882. In a short time the nuisance became as bad as ever, and the Board gave notice that they would move the Court for a sequestration of the property of the Company, upon which the Company 38 undertook wholly to discontinue the manufacture of Gas at the Station. They have so discontinued and have paid the costs of the action. Permanent Works. The following schedule of permanent works was prepared and a loan of £5,300 obtained from the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the works are now being carried out. PERMANENT WORKS.

THOMAS EDWARD JONES, E. F. TOMKINS, Clerk, Accountant. January, 1883. Shepherd's Bush road In pursuance of the advice of counsel the Board apportioned the estimated cost of paving a section of Shepherd's Bush Road, from Blythe lane to Lena Gardens, and orders were made by the magistrates for payment. Apportionment will be prepared for payment by the owners of the other sections of this road. Marlesford Lodge. It having been reported to the Board that Marlesford lodge, King street west, Hammersmith, had been taken by the Board of Managers of the Kensington and Chelsea School District, with the intention of establishing a branch school for the maintenance and education of certain classes of children. The Board appointed a Committee of five members with power to confer with the Managers and the Local Government Board on the matter, and the following letter was sent to the Clerk to the Managers.:— Board of Works, Fulham District, Broadway House, Hammersmith, 16th August, 1882. Dear Sir, This Board has learnt with considerable dismay that the Managers of the Kensington and Chelsea School District have made arrangements for taking the property known as Marlsford Lodge, Hammersmith, for the purpose of establishing a branch school for the maintenance of certain classes of children, preparatory to sending them to the District School at Banstead. The Board is informed that the children to be maintained in this establishment are those who are suffering from slight affections of the skin, scalp or eyes, of a non-contagious character, or who from other causes 43 not be sent to the school at Banstead in consequence of the strict nature of the medical certificate; in addition to other pauper children. This Board is of opinion that the establishment of such an institution in the main road of Hammersmith would be a source of nuisance and great injury to the surrounding neighbourhood, and I am instructed to ask the managers to reconsider the matter with a view to some site, other than in this district, being chosen for the establishment of the branch school in question. I may inform you that I have been directed to make representations to the Local Government Board on the subject. I shall be glad if you will bring this before an early meeting of the Managers, and favor me with their reply as soon as convenient. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. To which the following reply was received:— The Kensington and Chelsea School District. Clerk's Office, Marloes Eoad, Kensington, W. 29th August, 1882. Dear Sir, On my return to town, I find your letter of the 16th instant, with respect to Marlsford Lodge, which I will lay before the Managers at their meeting at the School at Banstead at half past twelve o'clock on Friday next, but as the Local Government Board's Order has been issued and the Lease settled, I do not think that there is the remotest chance of the Managers giving up what they consider very suitable premises for their purpose, for what you must pardon my calling a very remote, if not quite imaginary, injury to the surrounding neighbourhood. It is unnecessary for me to remind you that the Managers do not propose to do anything which will in the slightest degree constitute a legal nuisance, and I cannot refrain from suggesting that if any reduction in the letting value of the surrounding property should be traced to the establishment of the proposed school, the result will be due entirely to the indiscreetness of those who by raising an agitation have created a prejudice against the purpose for which the house is to be used, though this in itself is perfectly harmless, and would otherwise probably have been discovered by very few residents in the neighbourhood. It may be gratifying to your Board to know that as a rule the number of children in the school will be very limited, and that no 44 sick children will be kept therein, as every child who is sufficiently ill to require more than two or three days treatment, will be at once removed to the Infirmary of its Parish. Trusting that this explanation will obviate any further fruitless opposition, and assuring you of the earnest desire of my Board so to conduct the school as to avoid causing the slightest nuisance or even inconvenience to their neighbours, Believe me, Yours truly, (Signed) JOHN H. RUTHERGLEN, T. E. Jones, Esq., Clerk, Clerk to the Managers. Fulham Board of Works. The Local Government Board was written to as follows:— Board of Works, Fulham District. Broadway House, Hammersmith, 16th August, 1882. This Board has learnt with considerable dismay that the Managers of the Kensington and Chelsea School District have made arrangements for taking the property known as Marlesford Lodge, Hammersmith, for the purpose of establishing a branch school for the maintenance of certain classes of children, preparatory to sending them to the District School at Banstead. The Board is informed that the children to be maintained in this establishment are those who are suffering from slight affections of the skin, scalp or eyes, of a non-contagious character, or who from other causes cannot be sent to the School at Banstead, in consequence of the strict nature of the medical certificate; in addition to other pauper children. This Board is of opinion that the establishment of such an institution in the main thoroughfare of Hammersmith, would be a source of nuisance and great injury to the surrounding neighbourhood, and I am instructed to ask whether the scheme has been sanctioned by the Local Governmeut Board, if not, I am to ask that the sanction of the Board may be withheld until this Board has further communicated its views to the Local Government Board. I am Sir, Your obedient Servant, Local Government Board, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Whitehall. Clerk to the Board. A deputation was then appointed and waited upon the Local Government Board, and expressed the views of this Board upon the subject, and the following reply was received from the Local Government Board. Local Government Board, Whitehall, 27th September, 1882, Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that they 45 have had under consideration the representations submitted to them by the joint deputation which attended this office on the 15th instant, in opposition to the proposal of the Managers of the Kensington and Chelsea School District, to establish a School at Marlsford Lodge, Hammersmith. I am directed to state that it appears to the Board that no sufficient grounds were advanced to justify them in with-drawing the sanction which they gave so far back as the 28th July last to the acquisition by the Managers of the premises in question for the purposes of a district School, the lease of which property has already been executed. The Board desire to assure the inhabitants of Hammersmith that no danger is likely to arise from the opening: of the proposed school, inasmuch as it forms no part of the scheme to receive and maintain therein any child suffering from an infectious or contagious disease, about whose power of communicating disease there can be the slightest suspicion. It is therefore very improbable that there will be any risk of the spread of disease in the neighbourhood of the School. Moreover each of the parishes comprised in the School district has a separate Infirmary for the special treatment of the sick poor, and consequently there will be no inducement to the Guardians of those parishes to send sick children to the proposed school. If any child should after admission require active medical treatment for more than two or three days, such child will be at once discharged and removed to the infirmary of the parish to which it may be chargeable. The Board desire me to point out that the building proposed to be utilised as a school is situated about the middle of the land which the Managers have acquired and is thus wholly detached from the neighbouring buildings. I am, Sir, Your obedieut Servent, J. F. Rotten, Assistant Secretary. The Board has taken no further action in the matter. Hospital for Infectious Diseases. A letter having been received from the London Fever Hospital, informing the Board that in consequence of the great demands upon the accommodation of the Hospital for patients, it had been decided that no more cases of fever should be admitted into the Hospital upon theordersof Vestries or District Boards,it was referred to a Special Committee of the whole Board to proceed at once to obtain a suitable site for a Hospital for the reception of cases of infectious diseases occurring in this District 46 The Committee held two meetings, and in view of the action likely to be taken by the Government relative to the Government of London Bill,they recommended the Board to adjourn the consideration of the matter sine die, in the meantime patients have been sent as usual to the Fever Hosptal. Water by Meter. The Board have arranged with the West Middlesex Waterworks Company to supply the water for road-watering purposes by meter. The Company have agreed to provide and fix meters to every stand post at their own expense, the Board paying a rent of £2 2s per annum for each post and meter, and 1s. per 1000 gallons for the water. The Chelsea Water Company decline to supply the meters upon the same terms. Wood Paving—King Street West. A deputation of ratepayers and residents in King Street West between Shaftesbury Road and Goldhawk Road, presented a Memorial to the Board asking that that portion of King Street should be paved with Wood; and the Board, after making certain arrangements with the West Metropolitan Tramway Company resolved to carry out the works at an estimated cost of £2500 ; and it is anticipated this will be a great boon to the inhabitants when the tramway is opened for traffic. Government of London Bill. The Board having regard to the vast importance to the interest of the Ratepayers of the proposed bill for the Government of London, communicated with the Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis, and invited them to appoint delegates to attend a conference with power to make arrangements for urging upon the Ministry the necessity for providing for the continuance of Local Self Government, and to take such steps as might be deemed necessary. A communication was addressed to the various local bodies, and replies were received from some of them aquiescing in the proposition. No conference was, however, held, and as the bill was withdrawn for this year, the question stands over. Parliamentary Notices. In accordance with the standing orders of Parliament, plans, sections, books of reference and copy of Gazette notice were deposited at the office of the Board on the 30th day of November last, for the following schemes:— 1.—Metropolitan Board of Works—Bridges, etc. This Bill is for giving power to the Metropolitan Board of Works to re-construct Hammersmith Bridge, and for providing a 47 porary bridge for foot and vehicular traffic euring the reconstruction of the bridge, and other purposes. The Board resolved to petition in favor of the Bill, and the following petition was sealed by the Board and presented to Parliament, In the House of Commons, Session 1883. Metropolitan Board of Works Bridges &c. Petition: in favor. To the Honorable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. THE HUMBLE PETITION of the BOARD of WORKS for the FULHAM DISTRICT under their Common Seal. SHEWETH,— 1. A Bill promoted by the Metropolitan Board of Works (herein called "the Bill") is pending before Your Honorable House entitled Metropolitan Board of Works (Bridges Ac.) Bill for enabling the Metropolitan Board of Works "to alter and reconstruct Ham"mersmith Bridge: for providing for the free use by the public of "the East and West Ferry roads in the Parish of Poplar in the "County of Middlesex, and for other purposes. 2. Your Petitioners are the Board of Works for the Fulham District which includes the Parish of Saint Peter and Saint Paul Hammersmith within the area of which part of the Hammersmith Bridge and the approaches thereto are situate. 3. The Bill contains power to the Metropolitan Board to effect (with others) the following Improvements and Works:— (a) The reconstruction and maintenance of Hammersmith Bridge (s. 6). (b) The making and maintenance of a temporary Bridge with approach Roads during such alteration and reconstruction and until the same is opened for public traffic (s. 8). (c) The prohibition of the stopping up wholly or partially of the existing Bridge until such temporary Bridge is so made (6 sub, 2). 4. A reference to a map shewing the approaches to the said Bridge will demonstrate the importance of the same as a main arterial communication in the metropolis and neighbourhoods on both sides of the River Thames. 5. Your petitioners have by memorial and deputation represented to the Metropolitan Board that as at present constructed with a width of 14 feet only between the two Suspension Towers it is dangerous and unfit for general traffic, and is utterly inadequate to meet the exigences of the rapidly increasing population and traffic of the metropolis and locality and on account of the enormous amount of traffic passing over the Bridge, on ordinary days there being an average of about 7000 foot passengers and 1245 vehicles 48 it is essential that a temporary Bridge should be constructed for the accommodation of such traffic before the existing Bridge is stopped up for purpose of reconstruction or repairs. 6. The population and traffic of the metropolis as "well as of places beyond the metropolis use the said Bridge. 7. The populations of the District of your Petitioners was in 1871 - 66,041 and in 1881 - 114,811. 8. The works proposed by the Bill in respect of Hammersmith Bridge will be of public and local utility and advantage. 9. The Preamble of the Bill is accurate in stating the existing Bridge is dangerous and unfit for general traffic and that it is expedient to make the said provisions to alter and reconstruct the same and to provide for the construction of the temporary Bridge. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will be pleased to pass into a law the said Bill so far as it seeks to reconstruct the Said Hammersmith Bridge and erect a temporary Bridge during such reconstruction. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. Sealed by Order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. 21 st March, 1883. 2—Metropolitan Street Improvements. This Bill is for empowering the Metropolitan Board of Works to carry out certain improvements in the Metropolis, including the widening of King Street East from the Broadway to Rowan road, and Brook Green road from the Broadway to the Fire Brigade station and other purposes. The Board resolved to petition in favor of the Bill, and the following petition was sealed by the Board and presented to Parliament. In the House of Commons. Session 1883. Metropolitan Street Improvements Bill. Petition: in favor. To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. THE HUMBLE PETITION of the BOARD of WORKS for the FULHAM DISTRICT under their Common Seal. SHEWETH,- 1. A Bill promoted by the Metropolitan Board of Works is pending before your Honorable House (herein called "the Bill") entitled Metropolitan Street Improvements "for enabling the Metropolitan Board of Works to make certain new streets and street Improvements in the Metropolis and for other purposes." 49 2. Your petitioners are the Board of Works for the Fulham District comprising the parishes of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Hammersmith and the Parish of Fulham and have jurdisdiction under the said Metropolitan Management Acts of the Roads and Streets in the said area and other powers. 3.

Also the widenof Brook Green Road on its west side in the same Parish, such widening to commence at the Broadway and to terminate at the south side of the Fire Brigade Station in Brook Green Road. 4. King Street East is part of the Great Western Road, and is one of the most important main thoroughfares in the west of London leading from Hyde Park Corner to Hammersmith Bridge to Brentford and to many other towns and places beyond. It has a very large and continually increasing general public as well as local traffic but that part of the road from The Broadway, Hammersmith to Rowan Road (described in the Bill) is very narrow and the necessities of the increasing general public and local population and traffic require that the same should be widened so that such portion of the road should have a clear width of not less than 60 feet and which widening can be made and executed at a reasonable expense. 5. Brook Green Road is a much used main thoroughfare and communication between Notting Hill Bayswater and Paddigton and The Broadway and thence on through the Great Western Road to Kew Bridge and from The Broadway to Hammersmith Bridge and thence on to Barnes and other places, and will also so soon as the thoroughfare now being constructed between the Uxbridge and Harrow Roads across Wormwood Scrubbs is completed receive a very large accession of traffic from the neighbourhoods lying Northwards. 6. The population of your Petitioners said Fulham District is greatly on the increase, and was in 1871 - 66,041 and in 1881 - 114,811. 7. The said improvements and widenings being urgently needed and required your Petitioners have made applications to the Metropolitan Board of Works to include the said improvements and widenings as Public and Metropolitan Inprovements in any 50 measure they might think fit to introduce into Parliament to deal with Metropolitan Improvements and the said Board have included the same in the Bill before your Honourable House. 8. The preamble of tho Bill is accurate in stating that it is expedient that the Metropolitan Board of Works should be authorised to make the said new streets and streets improvements and other works therein mentioned. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will be pleased to pass the said Bill into a law so far as it applies to the said Improvements and widenings in King Street East, and Brook Green Eoad Hammersmith. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. Sealed by order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. 21 st March, 1883. 3.—WEST METROPOLITAN TRAMWAYS EXTENSION. Is a proposal to extend the Tramway scheme already authorised, through King Street East by a single line as far as the West End of Nazareth House, thence by a double line to Russell Road with a single line to Addison Road Station. Also for a double line from Broadway to the foot of Hammersmith Bridge. Also a branch from the existing tramway in Uxbridge Road, with a single lino along the road at the Western end of Shepherd's Bush Green (late Lawn Place,) thence down Shepherd's Bush Road to Broadway with double line, with the exception of a small length of about 3.9" chains of single line, Also for a line commencing at the top of North End Road, opposite "Bell and Anchor," passing down North End to Walham Green, round Melmoth Place, along London Road to Stamford Street, down Stamford Street to Kings Road, and so over the Stanley Bridge into Chelsea, whence it ramifies out to several branch lines and eventually terminates at Victoria Station. The line from the "Bell and Anchor" to Stanley Bridge consists principally of a single line, with a. number of passing places, some of considerable length, so much so that in those parts it may be looked upon more as a double line, than as passing places. There is also a proposed continuation from Uxbridge Road Station up Notting Hill nearly to Notting Hill Gate Railway, ay Station; this, however, affects this District very slightly. The Board, after hearing deputations on both sides, resolved to refuse their consent to the said Bill. 51 4.—EDGWARE AND UXBRIDGE ROAD TRAMWAYS. The Edgware and Uxbridge Roads Tramway, (Provisional Order) affected this District but very slightly, having only a length of about 18 yards in Uxbridge road, opposite Holland Road, forming the terminus of what is called "Hallidies' Cable System.” It was proposed that the Tramways be laid from Shepherd's Bush to the Marble Arch, and thence down Edgware road as far as the Bridge of the North London Railway, by the Edgware road or Brondesbury Station. The Board resolved to oppose this application for a provisional order. 5.—FULHAM, CHISWICK, ACTON, EALING AND HANWELL, ELECTRIC LIGHTING. (Provisional Order.) This application was for a provisional order to enable the Metropolitan Brush Electric Light and Power Company to light the above places with the Electric Light. The Board resolved to oppose the application. List of Contracts. Entered into by the Board during the period commencing 1st April, 1882, and ending June 30th, 1883. 5th April, 1882. Mr. W. Gr.

The Fulham District comprises an area of 4003 acres, and in the middle of last year its estimated population was 125,000 inhabitants. It is divided for registration purposes into three sub-districts, namely Fulham which is the parish of Fulham, and St. Peter's and St. Paul's which together constitute the parish of Hammersmith. These three subdistricts are hereafter designated as Fulham, St Peter's, and St Paul's. Fulham contains an area of 1716 statute acres, St Paul's 2102, and St Peter's 185. In the middle of last year there were 19523 inhabited houses in the district against 18819 at the end of the previous year, On the estimated population in the middle of last year there was an average of 6.4 persons in each house. Of the inhabited houses in the middle of last year there were 12250 in the parish of Hammersmith and 7273 in the parish of Fulham, against 11920 in the parish of Hammersmith and 6899 in the parish of Fulham at the end of the previous year. During the first six months of the past year there was therefore an increase of 704 in the number of inhabited houses. The total number of inhabit 3d houses in the whole district on the 31st of last December was 20,864, being an increase of 2045 in the year. Of this total number there were 12,700 in the parish of Hammersmith, and 8,164 in the parish of Fulham. There was therefore an increase of 780 houses inhabited in the parish of Hammersmith, and an increase of 1265 in the parish of Fulham. In the middle of last year there was on the estimated population an average of 31.2 persons to each acre in this district while there was an average of 51.6 to each acre in the whole of London. Very active building operations are still being carried on, although there 78 are a great many unoccupied houses. This is due in a great measure to the supply of new houses being much greater than the demand. The number of deaths registered in this district last year was 2499 (males 1193 females 1306) being one death to every 50.0 of the population, against 2473 in the previous year which equalled one death to each 46.9. The average number of deaths registered during the past 10 years was 2052. Making allowance for the increase of population the deaths last year were 113 below the corrected decennial average. This mortality includes all the deaths registered in the district. If however we deduct the 11 deaths of nonparishioners that took place at the Western District Hospital at Fulham, allowing the deaths of nonparishioners that took place at the West London Hospital and other public institutions in the district as compensative allowance for the unknown deaths of parishioners which may have taken place in general hospitals and other public institutions outside the district, the corrected mortality in this district last year was 2488. The gross annual death-rate therefore taking the deaths as registered was 19.9 per 1,000 persons living, being 1.5 less than the death rate of all London, which was 21.4. The mean deathrate in this district in the last 10 years was 20.8 while that in all London during the same period was 22.1. Of the deaths registered last year 132 took place in St Peter's 1247 in St Paul's and 1120 in Fulham, against 117 in St Peter's 1188 in St Paul's and 1168 in Fulham the previous year. The average number of deaths registered in the three sub-districts during the last 10 years was St Peter s 128 St Paul's 1027 and Fulham 897. There was therefore last year as compared with the last decennial average an increase of four deaths in St Peter's, 220 in St Paul's, and 223 in Fulham. 'This increase was due to the increase of population that has taken place through immigration. The death-rate last year in all three sub-districts was however lower than the mean death rate in the last ten years. TABLE I. The following table shows the deaths registered in the three sub-districts in the years 1881 and 1882, also the average number in the ten years 1873-1882:— Year. Sub-d;istrict of St. Peter's. Sub-Distrct of St. Paul's. Sub-district of Fulham. 1881 117 1188 1168 1882 132 1247 1120 Mean of the 10 years 1873-1882 128 1027 897 The number of deaths of infants at one year of age and under was 766 against 707 in the previous year. There were 26 in St. Peter's 394 in St Paul's and 346 in Fulham, against 35 in St Peter's 359 in St Paul's and 313 in Fulham during the previous year. 79 These deaths were equal to 30.6 per cent of the total deaths registered and 16.5 per cent of the total registered births. The percentage of these deaths in the whole of London was 24.3 to the total deaths registered and 15.1 to the total registered births. In the three sub-districts the percentage of these deaths to the total deaths and total births respectively was St Peter's 19.7 and 11.6 St Paul's 31.6 and 16.8 Fulham 31.0 and 16.8. This mortality rate therefore was as compared with the total deaths and total births greater in St Paul's and Fulham and less in St Peter's than in Lonndon, The mortality rate among infants is always greater in this district than in the whole of London. This is attributable to the fact that this district contains a very large proportion of poor class inhabitants. The infantile mortality rate was slightly greater in this district last year than in the year previous. The number of deaths at 60 years of age and upwards was 492, of which there were 38 in St Peter's, 260 in St Paul's, and 194 in Fulham, against 35 in St Peter's, 359 in St Paul's, and 313 in Fulham registered the previous year. These deaths were equal to 19.7 per cent of the total deaths registered, while the percentage of the same in all London was 20.7. The senile mortality rate therefore was less than that of all London. This is owing to the fact that a large number of young persons occupy the newly constructed houses. TABLE II. The following table shews the mean temperature; the population ; the number of persons to each acre; the number of births; the propoition of births to each 1000 persons living; the number of deaths; the proportion of deaths to each 1000 persons living ; and the proportion of persons living to each death.

This decrease in the mortality rate was due to the comparatively small number of deaths of non-parishioners at the Western District Hospital at Fulham last year. The fact however that the mortality rate last year was .9 below the decennial average, although the density of the population has increased in the same period from 18.2 to 37.1 persons per acre, is proof that the state of public health has not deteriorated.

In both of these quarters the number of deaths was increased by lung diseases, the result of the low temperature. Owing to the moderate temperature during the second and third quarters, the number of deaths from enteric diseases was comparatively small. The deaths of females exceeded those of males by 113. The mortality rate of males was as usual greater than that of females. The great disproportion in the number of males and females living in the district is the cause of the actual number of deaths of females being the larger. It is chiefly owing to the much greater mortality among males that there are so many more females, for there are more males annually born than females. The number of births registered in this district last year was 4637 (males 2356, females 2281), against 4513 in the previous year. The number of births of males exceeded that of females by 75. Of the births registered last year there were 225 in St Peter's (males 113, females 112); 2348 in St Paul's (males 1189, females 1159); and 2064 in Fulham (males 1054, females 1010). The birth rate in the whole district was at the rate of 37.1 births per 1000 persons living per annum, being one birth to each 26.9 persons. The birth rate in the whole of London was equal to 34.3 births per 1000 81 persons living per annum. The births exceeded the deaths in the district last year by 124. Estimating that the population has increased 9000 in the year, 2138 of this number was due to excess of births over deaths and 6862 to immigration. TABLE IV. The following table shows the quarterly number of births of each sex registered in the three sub-districts of the Fulham district during the year 1882. Sub-dist: of St. Peter's.

There was therefore a comparative increase of 87 in the number of these deaths last year, but taking into consideration the increase in the population, there was a comparative increase last year of 52 deaths from these diseases. The deaths of parishioners from zymotic diseases last year were equal to 19.6 per cent of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were at the rate of 3.9 deaths per annum per 1000 persons living. The deaths from these diseases in the whole of London were equal to 16.3 per cent of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 3 5 deaths per annum per 1000 persons living. There was therefore last year in this district a greater proportion of deaths from zymotic diseases than iu London both as compared with the total number of deaths registered and with the population. This higher percentage is owing to the very large proportion of poor inhabitants in this district. There is always a greater proportion of these diseases among the poor than among the rich. Of the 487 deaths from these diseases which occured last year, there were 19 111 St. 1 Peter's, against 18 the previous year; 215 in St. Paul's, against 220 the previous year, and 253 in Fulham, against 162 the previous year. Thus we see that there was a comparative increase of one in the number of these deaths in St Peter's, a comparative decrease of 5 in St, Paul's, and a comparative increase of 91 in Fulham. 82 TABLE V. The following table shews the deaths from zymotic diseases (exelusive of those of nonparishioners that took place at the Western District Hospital at Fulham) registered in the Fulham District in the years 1881 and 1882.

Small-pox. The epidemic of small-pox which so severely visited London the year before last very considerably abated last year. In London last year there were 431 deaths registered as occurring from this disease against 2371 in the year previous. In this district very few cases occurred, and not a single death was registered from the complaint. The energetic action which your Board adopted in the previous year was without doubt the cause of the very small number of cases reported last year. No trouble was spared to get cases properly isolated at hospitals; patients having been removed on several occasions in the middle of the night, directly information was received by your Inspector. No alteration in the law in reference to the isolation of cases of infectious disease has taken place since my last report was published. A bill is now before Parliament for the better notification of infectious diseases, but there is very little chance of its passing into law during the present year. I am very strongly in favour of such a Bill being passed but not in its present form, as many difficulties would arise in the working of it unless considerable alterations are made. I shall 83 have occasion to present to you a special report on the subject, so it will not be necessary for me to go further into the matter here. Daring last year 16 cases of small-pox (males 9, females 7) were reported in this district against 327, 266, 166,51 and 327 cases reported in the five years 1877, 1878, 1879, 1880 and 1881 respectively. From the absence of any deaths registered as occurring in private dwelling houses, we may be sure that there were very few cases treated at home besides the two that were reported. Of the 16 cases reported last year, there were 5 in the parish of Hammersmith against 82 in the previous year, and 11 in the parish of Fulham against 245 the previous year. There can not be any doubt that the great difference in the number of cases in the two parishes was to some extent due to the late Small-pox Hospital at Fulham. Still however, although the hospital is now closed, I should expect a greater proportion of cases in the parish of Fulham than in the parish of Hammersmith. The difference is due to the large number of poor class inhabitants in the Fulliam Parish. These 16 cases occurred in 11 houses in 10 streets. In 9 streets the outbreak was confined to one house in each street. In one street there were two outbreaks, 6 cases occurred singly in different houses in different streets. In 7 houses there was only one case in each house. In 4 houses there was more than one case in each house. Thus in one house there were three cases and in three houses 2 cases in each house. Of the 16 persons attacked with the disease 14 had been once vaccinated, 2 had never been vaccinated. In one case it was stated that the patient had been re-vaccinated. It was a very mild case and the patient soon recovered. This is the only instance out of 1153 cases of small-pox which have come under my observation in which the patient was said to have been successfully re-vaccinated. The ages varied from 2 to 54 years. The average age was 19 years. No deaths have occurred. Of the total cases reported, 14 were treated at hospitals and properly isolated, and two were treated at the residences of the patients and not reported till after the recovery of the patients. Your Board removed the 14 cases to hospitals, one to the Western District Hospital at Fulham, and 13 to the South Western District Hospital at Stockwell. The percentage of cases removed to hospitals was 87.5 as compared with a percentage of 84.7 in the year 1880. Of the 5 cases in the parish of Hammersmith all were removed to hospitals and properly isolated. Of the 11 in the parish of Fulham, 9 were removed to hospitals and properly isolated, two cases were treated at home. The number of cases reported last year is too small for the comparative percentage of removals in the two parishes to be of much practical significance. In every instance in which a case was early reported and removed to a hospital there was no second outbreak in the same house, whereas in those instances where cases were not reported early other persons contracted the disease in the same house. 84 TABLE VI. The following table shows the number of cases of small-pox that were reported in each of the parishes of the Fulham District during each of the 12 months of the year 1882; also the number of cases that were treated at hospitals and those that were treated at the residences of the patients.

It is also worthy of note that there were more than double the number of cases in the parish of Fulham than in the parish of Hammersmith notwithstanding the fact that the Fulham smallpox hospital has not received small-pox cases since the commencement of last year. The proportion of cases in the parish of Fulham as compared with Hammersmith was however about 6 per cent greater in the previous year when the hospital was receiving small-pox cases. It is satisfactory to be able to record that during the first six months of the present year no case of small pox has been reported with the exception of two cases at one house which cases were not absolutely decided to be small-pox by the Medical Superintendent of the hospital to which they were removed. TABLE VII. The following table shows the number of cases of small-pox reported in each parish of the Fulham district during the year 1882; the date when each case was reported; the localities where they occurred; the number of cases in each street; and the number of houses in which cases occurred. 85 Parish of Hammersmith.

It is very satisfactory to be able to record that out of all the cases reported last year no second person contracted the disease in the same house after the outbreak was reported. In two instances fresh cases occurred, but allowing the period of incubation (14 days) it will be seen that the patients had contracted the disease on or before the day that the first case was reported. The two cases which occurred at the West London Hospital came from the parish of Acton. One from Bollo Bridge Road, and one from Osborne Road. The patients had come over from Acton to obtain medical advice at the hospital not knowing that they were suffering from small-pox. Directly it was discovered that they were suffering from the disease they were isolated from the other out-door patients and afterwards removed to a small-pox hospital by your Inspector. The first case at Mendora Road was treated at home for several days before it was reported to your officers. It was found to be necessary to threaten to apply to the magistrate for an order for the removal of the first case as the mother strongly objected to 86 allow her child to be taken to a hospital. The latter two cases would have in all probability been prevented had the first case been reported early and removed to a hospital. The Royal Hospitals Commissioners which were appointed at the end of the year 1881 have published their report to the House of Commons, but 110 action has as yet beea taken by the Government to bring in a Bill to provide for the proper and prompt isolation of infectious diseases. The recommendations of the Commissioners have been presented to your Board and. published in my fourth quarterly report for last year. It is not therefore necessary for me to deal further with the subject in this report. Scarlet Fever. During last year scarlet fever was slightly less prevalent in London than in the previous year, there being 2004 deaths registered against 2108 in the year 1881. In the Fulharn district there was a greater number of cases reported last year than in the year previous. The number of deaths registered in this district last year was 85 against 65 in the year previous. These 85 deaths were equal to 3.4 per cent of the total deaths registered and were equivalent to an annual rate of .7 per 1000 persons living. The deaths from scarlet fever in London were equal to 2.4 per cent of the total deaths registered and were equivalent to an annual rate of .5 per 1000 persons living. Altogether there were reported last year 281 cases against 248, 180, 152, and 228 cases reported in the four years 1878-1881 respectively. These numbers do not represent all the cases that occurred in this district because a very large proportion are treated at home and never reported to your Sanitary Department at all. Of the cases reported last year there were 106 in the parish of Hammersmith against 140 in the previous year, and 175 in the parish of Fulharn against 88 in the previous year. There was therefore a decrease of 34 cases in the parish of Hammersmith, and an increase of 87 cases in the parish of Fulham last year as compared with the previous year. It is worthy of note that with the opening of the Western District Hospital at Fulham for fever cases there has been a great increase in the number of cases of fever in the Fulham parish. It would not be correct on this account to assume that the disease has spread from the hospital as it has been open too short a time for the fact to have much practical significance. In 73 of the 85 cases in which death took place the first information was obtained in the death returns. 24 of the cases were not reported until after the recovery of the patients. In 138 cases the patients or their relatives refused the offer of removal to a hospital. The accommodation in many of these cases was not sufficient for the effectual isolation of the disease but was not so bad as regards the provision for the treatment of the patient that a magistrate's order could be obtained to enforce the removal. 48 patients were removed to hospitals, 11 to the "Western District Hospital at Fulham, and 37 to the South Western District Hospital at Stockwell. Of the 87 48 cases taken to hospitals 47 were removed by your Board, and one by the Fulham Board of Guardians. In all of the cases reported a most careful system of disinfection was carried out by your Inspector. We may estimate from the number of deaths registered that there were about 1700 persons attacked by the disease in this district last year. Seeing that there were only 281 cases reported it is not surprising that the measures adopted by your Board, although all that could possibly be done under the circumstances, should have been ineffectual in stamping out the disease. Until sanitary law is so amended that all cases shall be immediately reported and properly isolated, we can not expect to find any considerable diminution in the present number of cases. The Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Fulham which was used for the reception of small-pox oases being now utilised as a fever hospital for the isolation of cases of fever from the western districts of London, it may be of advantage for a list of the streets in which scarlet fever occurred to be published, also a table showing the number of cases in each month of the vear. TABLE VIII. The following table shows the number of cases of scarlet fever that were reported in each parish of the Fulham District during each of the twelve months of the year 1882, also the number of cases that were treated at hospitals, and those that were treated at private dwellings.

The very reverse takes place in the case of scarlet fever that occurs with small-pox. There is usually a very much larger number of cases of scarlet fever in the second half of the year than in the first. In the latter six months of last 88 year there were 73 more cases reported than in the first half of the year. The following table shows the number of cases of scarlet fever reported in each parish of the Fulham district daring the year 1882; the date when each case was reported; the localities where they occurred; the number of cases in each street; and the number of houses in which cases occurred.

Western District Hospital at Fulham. The late Fulham Smallpox Hospital has been renamed, and is now designated the Western District Hospital. At the end of the year 1881, there were but four cases of smallpox remaining in the hospital. In the early part of January 1882 two cases were removed there as smallpox, but were found on admission not to be suffering from the disease. The Metropolitan Asylums Board resolved at the end of January last year to admit no more cases of smallpox, and at the end of the following September they determined to convert the building into a hospital for ncarlet fever. On October the 6th, cases of scarlet-fever were admitted and the districts of Kensington, Fulham, Chelsea, Wandsworth and Clapham, were allocated to this hospital. It was afterwards resolved that on and after November the 25th, cases of enteric fever should be admitted. Altogether last year there were 165 admissions, 149 of which were scarlet fever, 13 enteric fever, and 3 other diseases. 139 of the scarlet fever cases were acute and 10 were convalescent cases sent from the Stockwell Fever Hospital. During last year there were 12 deaths registered. The mortality rate among the acute cases was 7.9 percent, and there were no deaths from enteric fever. Diptheria. There were 29 cases diptheria reported last year, 14the parish of Fulham, 15 in the parish of Hammersmith, The number of deaths registered was 27. These deaths were equivalent to an annual rate of .2 per 1000 persons living, and werre equal to 1*1 per cent. of the total deaths registered. The deaths from diptheria in all London were equivalent to an annual rate of .2 per 1000 persons living and were equal to 10 per cent of the total deaths registered. 27 cases were first reported in the death returns. One case was too bad to be removed, but the patient afterwards recovered ; and one case was removed to St. George's Hospital by the relatives of the patient. In all cases strict and immediate enquiry was made into the sanitary condition of the houses in which the patients had resided, and where sanitary defects were found to exist, the owner or occupier of the premises was required to remedy them. In every case reported a most careful system of disinfection was carried out by your Inspector. Whooping Cough. There were 208 deaths from whooping cough last year, 127 in the parish of Fulham and 81 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 39 registered during the previous year of which there were 6 in the parish of Fulham, and 33 in the parish of Hammersmith. These 208 deaths last year were equivalent to an annual rate of 92 1.7 per 1000 persons living1 and were equal to 8.3 per cent of the deaths registered. The deaths from whooping cough in all London were equivalent to an annual rate of 12 per 1000 persons living and were equal to 5.6 per cent of the total deaths registered. There was a great increase in the number of deaths from this disease not only in this district but in all London. There were registered in London 4647 deaths last year against 19G1 in the year previous. In all of the cases in which death occurred in this district last year strict enquiries were made as to the sanitary conditions of the houses in which the patients had resided, and where sanitary defects were found to exist the owners or occupiers of the premises were called upon to remedy them. Typhus Fever. No death was registered from typhus fever in this district last year, and only one (in the parish of Hammersmith) in the previous year. The deaths from typhus fever in all London last year were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.1 per 1000 persons living andjwere equal to .06 per cent of the total deaths registered. Enteric or Typhoid Fever. There were 31 cases of enteric fever reported last year of which there were nine in the parish of Fulliam, and 22 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 33 in the previous year of which there were 13 in the parish of Fulham, and 20 in the parish of Hammersmith. There were 26 deaths registered from this disease in this district last year. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of .2 per 1000 persons living, and were equal to 10 per cent of the total deaths registered. The deaths from this disease in all London were equal to an annual rate of .2 per 1000 persons living, and were equal to 1.2 percent of the total deaths registered. Of the cases reported in this district last year 24 were not reported till after the death of the patients. Two cases were removed to the Stockwell Fever Hospital by your Board, 4 cases were too bad to be removed ; and one case was not reported until after the recovery of the patient. In all of the cases reported last year a most careful system of disinfection was carried out by your officers, and in every case the sanitary condition of the dwelling where the patient resided was carefully examined, and where sanitary defects were found to exist the owner or occupier of the house was called upon to remedy them. Measles. During last year 69 cases of measles were reported, 26 in the parish of Fullham and 43 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 63 cases reported in the previous year, of which there were 25 in the parish of Fulham and 38 in the parish of Hammersmith. These cases only represent a small proportion of the number of cases which actually occurred, as information of only 5 cases was obtained in which death did not take place. 64 deaths were registered. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of .5 per 1000 persons 93 living, and were equivalent to 2.7 per cent of the total deaths registered. The deaths from this disease in all London were equal to an annual rate of .6 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to 2.8 per cent of the total deaths registered. Two cases were removed by your Board to the Western District Hospital at Stockwell. In three cases the offer to remove the patient was refused. and in 64 the first information obtained was in the death returns. In all the cases which occurred a careful system of disinfection was carried out, and the sanitary condition of the dwelling was seen to. Simple Continued Fever. There were three cases of simple continued fever reported, all of which occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, against 3 registered in the previous year, which also occurred in the Hammersmith parish. All of these cases last year were reported in the death returns. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of .02 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to -1 per cent of the total deaths registered. The deaths from this disease in all London were equal to an annual rate of .02 per 1000 persons living and were equivalent to -.1 per cent of the total deaths registered. In all the cases reported a careful system of disinfection was carried out by your officers, and the sanitary condition of the houses where the patients had resided was seen to. Diarrhoea. There were 72 deaths from diarrhoea reported last year, of which there were 25 in the parish of Fulham, and 47 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 139 in the year previous, of which there were 49 in the parish of Fulham, and 90 in the parish of Hammersmith. In all the cases reported the houses where the patients had resided were carefully inspected, and where sanitary defects were found to exist the owner or occupier of the premises was required to remedy the defect. These deaths last year were equal to an annual rate of .6 per 1000 persons living and were equivalent to 2.9 per cent of the total deaths registered. The deaths from diarrhoea in all London were equal to an annual rate of 5 per 1000 persons living and were equivalent to 2.6 percent of the total deaths registered. English Cholera. There were two deaths registered from English Cholera last year, both of which occurred in the parish of Fulham, against no case registered in the previous year. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of .02 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to .08 per cent of the total deaths registered. The deaths from English Cholera in all London were equal to an annual rate of .02 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to .09 per cent of the total deaths registered. Violent Deaths. There were 83 deaths from violence of which there were 22 in 94 the parish of Fulham, and 61 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 76 in the previous year, of which there were 17 in the parish of Fulham, and 59 in the parish of Hammersmith. The great difference in the number of the deaths in the two parishes is due to there being a very much larger population in the parish of Hammersmith than in the parish of Fulham, also because in the former parish there is a public hospital which admits accident cases from other districts. Inquests. There were 165 inquests held last year, of which there were 55 in the parish of Fulham, and 110 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 151 in the previous year, of which there were 54 in the parish of Fulham, and 97 in the parish of Hammersmith. Deaths in Public Institutions. There were 214 deaths registered as occurring at public instituions, of which there were 50 in the parish of Fulham, and 64 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 447 in the previous year, of which there were 390 in the parish of Fulham, and 57 in the parish of Hammersmith. Of the 149 in the parish of Fulham 137 (males 75 and females 62) took place at the Fulham Union Workhouse ; 12 (males 6 and females 6) at the Western District Hospital ; and one a female at the Female Convict Prison. The 64 in the parish of Hammersmith (males 45 females 19) occurred at the West London Hospital. The great diminution in the number of deaths in the parish of Fulham, was due to the small number of deaths registered at the Fulham hospital; there being only 12 deaths registered as occurring in that institution last year against 258 deaths in the year previous. Piggeries- The nuisance occasioned by keeping swine in many parts of the district still continues. There are very few swine kept in the parish of Fulham, your Board having obtained magistrate's orders in nearly every case during the last six years. In the parish of Hammersmith there are however a great many kept in localities and in a condition so as to be a serious nuisance and injurious to health. At present there is a difficulty in obtaining evidence to support a case for prosecution; as the inhabitants although annoyed by the nuisance are unwilling to come forward and give evidence against their neighbours. During last year several piggeries were abolished under notices from your Board, and three summonses were taken out against pig-keepers. In one Fulham case the magistrate made an order for the removal of the swine, giving the defendant three months to dispose of them. In this case several witnesses were called to prove a nuisance. It was a case in which the same magistrate had viewed the locality and refused to give an order on a previous occasion. Since then a large number of houses had been built and inhabited in close proximity to the piggery. In the other two cases, which were in the parish of Hammersmith, the magistrate refused to make orders because none of the inhabitants 95 of the locality were willing to come forward and give evidence as to the existence of a nuisance. Licensed Cow House. The whole of the licensed cow houses in the district were kept under a regular quarterly inspection during last year. With very few exceptions they were found to be well conducted in conformity with your Board's requirements. Licensed Slaughter Houses. The whole of the licensed slaughter houses in the district were regularly inspected once a quarter. They were found to be well managed, and in a clean condition. Bakehouses. There are 120 Bakehouses in the district. Under my instruction they were regularly inspected once a quarter. In many cases they were found to be in an unsanitary condition. Notices were at once served under the Nuisance Removal Act, requiring the bakers to remedy the defects and in every case compliance with the requirements of the notice was obtained. Sanitary Work. During last year 423 notices were served by your three Sanitary Inspectors for the removal of nuisances, and 1.37 by your Dust Inspectors for the construction of proper dust bins. 16 summonses were taken out, 15 for the non-compliance with notices to remove nuisances on private premises, and one for disobeying a magistrate's order. In eight cases magistrate's orders were made for the nuisances to be removed and the cost of the summonses to be paid. In all of these cases the order was complied with. Seven summonses were withdrawn, 5 with and 2 without costs. In these 7 cases the notice had been complied with by the day that the summonses were to be heard. In the case of the summons for disobeying a magistrate's order,, the defendant was fined £7 12s. 6d., and was ordered to pay £l 9s. costs. There were 61 cases of infectious diseases removed to the hospital, and disinfection was carried out in reference to 350 cases. It must be obvious to any one looking at the foregoing figures that a very large amount of work is performed annually by your sanitary inspectors. Still, however, there is not sufficient regular inspection of the poor class property. The whole of the poor class property in the district ought to be inspected at least once a quarter. I find that a very large amount of two of your inspectors' time is taken up in reference to the collecting of samples for analysis and in prosecutions under the Adulteration Act. It is my opinion that there is quite enough for them to do if they work their utmost without additional work, and that the regular sanitary inspection of the district cannot be properly performed under the present system. I beg to remind you that the population of this district has been greatly increasing of late years, and the sanitary work has been growing at a still greater rate, owing to the strict regulations of your sanitary department. 96 Public Mortuary, &c. There were only four dead bodies removed by your Board to the mortuaries at the Cemeteries during last year. There have been a great many bodies removed by the police to the mortuary at the Fulham Union Workhouse. It is necessary that in every district there should be a public mortuary where bodies of persons who have died in the street or for whom there is not proper accommodation at their residences can be taken to. Your Board have had under consideration the question of your providing a public mortuary, with coroner's court and post mortem room in conformity with 27 and 28 sect, of the Sanitary Act, 1866. Owing to the proposed change in the Local Self Government of the Metropolis you have decided not to build one at present. The Fulham Board of Guardians having refused to allow bodies brought by the police to be any longer received at their mortuary at the Fulham Union Workhouse 96 your Board has fitted up a temporary mortuary and post mortem room at the Wharf in the Chancellors. Chancery Proceedings. The action against the Metropolitan Railway Company for creating a nuisance at the Hammersmith station of the Metropolitan Railway by the manufacture of gas has terminated. A perpetual injunction has been granted restraining the Company, their officers or servants, from manufacturing at the said station gas so as to create a nuisance and the Company were ordered to pay the costs of the Action, and the costs of the Motion. The Chancery Action taken by you against the Manbre Saccharine Company for creating a nuisance has terminated by a verdict being returned for the defendants: "That there was no nuisance, and never had been one." The case was heard before Lord Coleridge and a special Jury. Very strange to say the Lord Chief Justice expressed himself as fully satisfied with the verdict, and your Board was ordered to pay the costs of the action. There can be no doubt about the fact that a most serious nuisance was caused at the works. I am informed by several of the inhabitants that the nuisance is at times as bad as ever. I was and am of opinion that an injunction ought to have been granted. I gave evidence "that the nuisance was at times and in my opinion would be as bad as ever." Your Board have done your duty in the matter, and you are not responsible for the health and comfort of the inhabitants being sacrificed. The average mean temperature registered during last year was 49°5 Fahrenheit. The highest temperature registered was 81°0; the lowest 22°2. The total quantity of rain registered as falling in the year was 27.11 inches. I am, Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health.
