In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Vestry present the followingReport of their proceedings and an abstract of their accounts for the twelve months ended the 25th March last; also a statement of Contracts entered into or in force during that time, and the liabilities of the Vestry at the end thereof, together with the Report of their Surveyor for the same period, and of their Medical Officer of Health for the year 1891. With a view to affording the ratepayers as complete a knowledge as possible of the administration of parochial affairs generally, the Vestry again append to their Report, Statements of Accounts relating to the Guardians of the Westminster Union, the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, and the Trustees of Charitable Endowments in which the parish is interested. 14 THE PARISH. Extent.—The Parish occupies an area of 164 acres. It has about 12½ miles of streets, of which 3½ miles are paved with wood, 5¼ with asphalte, ¾ with pitching, 1½ with macadam, and 1½ miles consists of courts, yards, and passages. Population.—The resident population, according to the census taken on the 6th April, 1891, is given by the Registrar-General as 24,993, and the number of inhabited houses as 2,641. Some comparative figures relating to the population of the Parish are given on page 37. Local Government.—The Parish has a separate jurisdiction under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and particulars of the powers of the Vestry elected pursuant to that Act are given on page 17. For Poor Law purposes the Parish is joined to the Parish of St. Anne, under the name of the Westminster Union; it is also a constituent part of the Central London Sick Asylum District. Wards.—The Parish has been divided into four wards for the election of Vestrymen, and this division is followed in the preparation of the Lists of Voters for Member of Parliament, the County Council, and School Board. The name of the ward is printed on the rate receipt of each ratepayer. For Ecclesiastical Purposes the Parish has been sub-divided into five districts, the mother church being St. James's, Piccadilly, of which the Rev. J. E. Kempe, M.A., is Rector. 15 Representation in Parliament.—The Parish of St. James was formerly comprised in the Parliamentary Borough of the City of Westminster, which returned two members to Parliament; it now, however, forms a part of the Borough of Strand, which returns one member, the present representative being the Hon. W. F. D. Smith. The Register prepared in 1891 contains the names of 4,278 Parliamentary electors, viz., 4 on the Scot and Lot List, 282 Lodgers, and 3,996 possessing other qualifications. There are also 550 County Electors who have been placed on the Register under the Local Government Act, 1888, but are not qualified to vote for members of Parliament. Parliamentary voters for the County of Middlesex, in respect of property situate wholly or in part in the Parish St. James, number 165. By the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Westminster Division of the School Board for London. Five members of the School Board are elected by the ratepayers of the Division. Water Supply.—Four Companies supply the Parish with water, the approximate boundaries of their respective districts being as follows:— 1. Chelsea Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 35, Commercial Road, Pimlico). So much of the Parish as lies to the south of the centre of Pall Mall and Cleveland Row. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1722. 2. New River Company (Chief Office, Clerkenwell, E.C.). So much of the Parish as lies to the east of a line running 16 at the back of the east side of Poland Street, Lexington Street, Great Windmill Street, and along the centre of the Haymarket. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1619. 3. Grand Junction Waterworks Company (Chief Office,. 65, South Molton Street). So much of the Parish as lies to the west of the district supplied by the New River Company and the north of the centre of Pall Mall. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1811. 4. West Middlesex Waterworks Company (Chief Office,. 19, Marylebone Road). So much of Oxford Street as is situate within the Parish. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in the year 1806. The rates of charge for a supply of water for domesticpurposes authorised by the various Acts of Parliament relating to the several above-mentioned Companies are almost identical, the scale being as follows:— Where the annual value of the dwelling-house or other place does not exceed £200, a rate not exceeding 4 per cent. per annum; where such annual value exceeds £200, a rate not exceeding 3 per cent. per annum. An additional charge, varying from 4s. per annum where the annual value of the house exceeds £30 but is less than £50, to 12s. where the annual value of the house exceeds £300, is permitted for each single water-closet, fixed bath, or high service; for each additional water-closet, fixed bath, or high service,. half these rates are to be charged. High service is defined as a delivery of water at an elevation of more than ten feet above the pavement in front of the dwelling-house or other place supplied. 17 The Companies may supply water for other than domestic purposes, either upon agreed terms or by meter at a specified rate. Gas is supplied to the whole Parish by the Gas Light and Coke Company (Chief Office, Horseferry Road). The Coroner is Mr. John Troutbeck, whose jurisdiction extends throughout the City and Liberties of Westminster. For the Registration of Births and Deaths the Parish is included in the Westminster District. The SubRegistrar is Mr. Thomas Matthew Crowe, of 31, Wardour Street; and the Superintendent Registrar, Mr. Joseph Bond. Union Offices, Poland Street. THE VESTRY, as now constituted under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, consists of 48 elected and three ex-officio members, the latter being the Rector and Churchwardens. It superseded a Vestry elected under the provisions of a permissive statute, 1 & 2 William IV., cap. 60, which was adopted by the ratepayers of St. James's on the 6th April 1832. This elected Vestry had, in its turn, superseded a select Vestry established by the Act under which the Parish was created in 1685. The select Vestry was virtually a self-appointed body, vacancies being filled up by the surviving members. Neither the ancient select Vestry nor the Vestry elected under the statute of 1831 had any jurisdiction over the paving or drainage of the Parish. Each of these matters was under the control of a separate and distinct body of B 18 Commissioners. The Act of 1855 transferred to the Vestry, as now constituted, not only all the powers of the earlier Vestry, but also those relating to paving, drainage, and lighting formerly exercised by these Commissioners. Subsequent legislation has laid upon the Vestry various additional duties; and, in many respects, the powers of the Vestry within the area of its jurisdiction resemble those of the town council of a corporate town, with further rating powers, although as regards the police force, the provision of markets, and the supply of gas and water, not this Parish alone, but the metropolis at large, stands on a different footing from provincial towns of comparatively minor importance. The following pages will show the diversity of subjects coming within the purview of the Vestry, but it may be convenient here to enumerate the more important functions of that body, viz.:— (1) Paving, cleansing, watering, and lighting the public streets. (2) Constructing, maintaining, and cleansing loca] sewers, public conveniences, &c. (3) Supervising the construction, alteration, and amendment of the drains and sanitary arrangements of dwelling-houses and other buildings. (4) Preventing, removing, and abating nuisances injurious to health, disinfecting after sickness, &c. (5) Regulating projections into the public streets, and annoyances of various kinds. 19 (6) Preserving, as far as possible, freedom from adulteration in articles of food and medicine (7) Levying and collecting the rates, from which large and, unfortunately, rapidly increasing sums are paid annually to authorities entirely independent of local control. Upon the last-mentioned point it may be here observed that there has been a growing tendency for some years to include in the local rates various sums for Metropolitan purposes. Thus since the year 1855 the Vestry have at different times been required by Parliament to provide funds for—(a) Main Drainage; (b) Fire Brigade; (c) Elementary Education; (d) Thames Bridges—purchase, maintenance, and rebuilding; (e) Artizans' Dwellings, and other purposes. The extent to which this operates upon local rates will be seen on reference to the statement of moneys raised with the parochial rates for metropolitan purposes, which is given on page 42. THE ELECTION OF VESTRYMEN AND AUDITORS OF ACCOUNTS Was held on Thursday, the 21st, and Friday, the 22nd days of May, the places appointed for the purposes being—Pall Mall Ward, Willis's Rooms, King Street; Church Ward, Vestry Hall. Piccadilly; Golden Square Ward, Craven Hall Marshall Street; and Great Marlborough Ward, Board Room, Poland Street. The total expense of conducting the elections, including a poll in two of the Wards, amounted to £10 12s. 1d., and an order for the payment of this sum from the Poor Rate was made by the Vestry in accordance with the statute. B 2 20 A list of the Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts will be found on pages 7 and 8. DEATH OF MR. JAMES BEAL. The Vestry do not usually chronicle in their Annual Report the names of Vestrymen dying during the year but Mr. Beal occupied so exceptional a position in connection with the Local Government of London that his death demands some notice in a Report relating to a public body of which he was a valued member for upwards of thirty years. • Mr. Beal was an active politician who placed social questions in the front rank. With his political opinions the Vestry have no concern, party politics happily not entering into their deliberations in the slightest degree. Nor are they in any way identified with the development of Land and Building Societies to which Mr. Beal vigorously applied himself in his earlier days. But the Vestry have been largely concerned in two questions of paramount importance to Londoners, gas and water, with which the name of Mr. Beal is intimately associated. The agitation with regard to gas commenced in 1857, and may be said to have continued until 1876, when the present sliding scale, to which some reference is made on page 60, was adopted. Another useful outcome of the agitation on the question of gas was the acceptance by Parliament of the principle (since extended to the Water Companies) that new issues of capital should be put up to auction or tender instead of being allotted at par to the existing shareholders. 21 The recent development of the London water question was dealt with at length in last year's report, and is further referred to on page 115 of this report. It is therefore unnecessary to enlarge upon it here. It may, however, be added that the Vestry have the best reason for believing that Mr. Beal felt most keenly the opposition of the London County Council to the Metropolis Water Supply Bill of last year, in the promotion of which he took an active part. This Bill Mr. Beal regarded as being capable, by slight amendment, of placing the water supply of London on a proper basis. Another important question which Mr. Beal pressed forward was the adaptation to altered circumstances of the ancient charities of the City of London, and it is scarcely too much to say that his persistent action led to the passing of the City of London Parochial Charities Act, 1883, which, it is hoped, will largely promote technical instruction by providing means for assisting in the erection and maintenance of Polytechnics in various parts of London. As a mark of respect to Mr. Beal's memory, the Vestry adjourned without transacting any business, on his death being announced at their meeting on the 11th June. DEATH OF MR. FREDERICK CRANE. Although Mr. Crane retired from the Vestry in the year 1889, on account of advancing years, and therefore was not a member at the time of his death, which occurred on the 20th May last, his services to the Parish extended over so long a period and were of such unusual value that the 22 Vestry deem it only right to take the present opportunity of briefly expressing their sense of the loss which the Parish has sustained, and of the obligations under which the parishioners rest for his unwearied and unselfish devotion to the public good. The following resolution, which was unanimously passed on the retirement of Mr. Crane from the Vestry in 1889,. refers to the more important of the services rendered to the Parish by that gentleman during a long and active life : That at the close of the 21st year for which Mr. Frederick Crane has filled the office of Churchwarden of the Parish, the Vestry of St. James, Westminster, desire to place on record their appreciation of the manner in which he has performed the duties of that office. First elected Churchwarden in the year 1850, he was re-elected at intervals until 1876, since which year he has been continuously re-elected annually. Throughout that lengthened period he has filled the office to the entire satisfaction alike of the Rector and Parishioners. To his indefatigable labours the Parish owes so successful an issue to the protracted inquiry into the Craven Pest House Charity; by his patient efforts the administration of the Tenison Schools and other Charitable Endowments in which the Parish is interested, has been strengthened and improved; with rare skill he traced the history of the Conduit Street property, formerly the site of Trinity Chapel, and thus led to the Parish of St. James being admitted to participate in the valuable Almshouse and Pension Charity of the Mother Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields; and by unflagging interest and exertions he succeeded in effecting several improvements in the fabric of the Church. The Ve&try tender to Mr. Crane their grateful acknowledgment of his long continued and valuable services to the Parish, not only in these varied ways but also as a Vestryman, and member of many other Parochial bodies, and as a small testimony of his unblemished career and life of usefulness, order this Resolution to be entered on the Minutes of their proceedings. 23 VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS, The following is the number of meetings held during the year Vestry Meetings 27 Finance and House Committee 23 Sanitary, Parliamentary Bills, and General Purposes Committee 19 Works and Improvements Committee 26 Sanitary and Works Committee (Joint) 2 Lighting Committee 9 St. James's Dwellings Committee 10 Valuation Committee 4 Special and Sub-Committees 10 Total. 130 The Vestry usually meet on alternate Thursday mornings but a special meeting may be convened at any time upon the requisition of five members, and some of the ordinary meetings are suspended at vacation times. Five Standing Committees are appointed annually, in accordance with the bye-laws of the Vestry, and meet as frequently as occasion may require. Special Committees are appointed from time to time to consider subjects not coming within the ordinary duties of either of the Standing Committees. OFFICERS OF THE VESTRY. Vestry Clerk's Department.—With the exception of an increase in the salaries of the assistants in January, no alteration has taken place in this department during the year. 24 Surveyor's Department.—Mr. H. J. J. Watson, the foreman in charge of the orderly boys and the arrangements for street ballasting, Sunday watering, &c., resigned in the month of March, on being appointed Sanitary Inspector in the Parish of Islington. The vacancy caused by his resignation had not been filled up at Lady day. The report of a Special Committee appointed to enquire into the administration of the stonevard was also under tion at Lady-day. Sanitary Department.—The Parish has been divided into two districts for the purpose of sanitary inspection, each Inspector having co-ordinate authority in his own district. Mr. John Percy Folland was appointed Sanitary Inspector, at a salary of £120 per annum, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of the late Assistant Inspector. Rate Collectors.—Circumstances rendered an alteration necessary in the arrangements for the collection of rates in Church Ward, and Mr. J. H. Madge was appointed to fill the place formerly occupied by Mr. R. E. Burgess. Generally.—A list of the Officers of the Vestry and their respective salaries will be found on page 172. ALTERATION OF BYE-LAW. Bye-law No. 17 was altered by the Vestry on the l6th April, and the alteration duly confirmed at a subsequent meeting to provide for the appointment of the Valuation Committee by the Vestry. The former practice was for the Works Committee to appoint a Sub-Committee as occasion required, to assess new properties and consider applications for the revision of assessments. 25 STANDING ORDERS. Operative Resolutions in the nature of Standing Orders have been passed during the year as follows :— 2nd April, 1891.

The Vestry appointed Churchwardens on the 2nd day of April, when Mr. Samuel Morle was again chosen Senior Churchwarden, and Mr. John Malin was elected Junior Churchwarden. SIDESMEN Were elected by the Vestry on the 2nd day of April, the under-mentioned gentlemen being selected to till the office:— Mr. James Malin, 10 and 17, King Street. Mr. Benjamin F. Hawkins, 108, Jermyn Street. Mr. James Thomas Robertson, 7, St. James's Street. Mr. Edmund Thomas Morgan, 45, Marshall Street. OVERSEERS OF THE POOR. Eight parishioners were nominated by the Vestry on the 2nd day of April to serve as Overseers of the Poor. The gentlemen chosen from this list, and appointed by the 28 •Justices of the Peace, at a Petty Sessions held 011 the 10th April, to act as Overseers for the year 1891-2, were:— Mr. Alfred Court, 46, Poland Street. Mr. James Tapping, 52, Berwick Street. Mr. Frederick Glover, 30, Beak Street. Mr. Daniel Godden, 109, Jermyn Street. PREACHER AND ASSISTANT. Under the provisions of the local Act of Parliament by which the Parish was created, the Rector is authorised and required, from time to time, to nominate, with the consent of the Vestry, one able Minister in Priest's Orders to reside in the Parish, to be Preacher and Assistant to the Rector and his successors in the celebration of the Divine offices of praying and preaching, and other duties incident to be performed in the Church and Parish as the Rector shall require of him. A salary of £100 a year, payable from the Poor-rate, is assigned to the PreacherAssistant. A vacancy having occurred by the preferment of the Rev. H. Bury to the living of Newcliurch, Rosendale, Lancashire, the Rector nominated the Rev. Hubert Handley, M.A., of Oxford, as Preacher and Assistant, and 011 the 16th April, the Vestry assented to the nomination. CLERK IN ORDERS. The Act of Parliament above referred to also authorises .and requires the Rector, with the consent of the Vestry, to nominate, from time to time, a lit person in Priest's Orders to be Clerk of the Parish and Parish Church. In 29 addition to the accustomed fees payable to the Parish Clerk, the Clergyman so appointed is entitled to a salary of £30 per annum, payable from the pew rents. On the 16th April, the Rector nominated, with the consent of the Vestry, the Rev. W. T. Farmiloe, M.A., of Cambridge, to be Clerk of the Parish and Parish Church, in succession to the Rev. E. W. Windle, who had some time previously been presented to the living of Ugborough, Devonshire. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES. The Act to encourage the establishment of Public Batl is and Washhouses was adopted by the Vestry in the same year that it became law, 1846. The Act is not administered by the Vestry, but by seven Commissioners appointed by them. The Commissioners are largely independent of the Vestry, but have to obtain their consent to contracting loans, and also to expenditure in certain cases. They are not required to periodically report their proceedings to the Vestry, although it has become their practice of late years for them to present a report annually. From the Annual Report of the Commissioners presented to the Vestry in January, it appears that the number of bathers and washers (156,428) was nearly 7,000 in excess of the number for the previous year, and that this increase is spread over every class using the building. This report contains information of permanent interest,, and the following extracts are therefore given:— 30 The charge for the Laundry, including a supply of boiling and cold water, and the use of a mechanical wringer, steam dryinghorse, mangle, and irons, is but 2d. per hour, and the Commissioners desire once more to impress upon all who are brought into close contact with the labouring classes, the immense convenience thus afforded to those whose home is restricted to one or two rooms. It will be observed that the receipts last year (£3,212 10s. 4d.) •were larger than for either of the two previous years. This increase arises partly from a larger number of bathers and washers using the establishment, and partly from the Vestry for the first time paying the Commissioners for washing the towels, attendants' blouses, &c., used at the Piccadilly Lavatories and conveniences. This washing, the Commissioners did gratuitously for the first year after the lavatories were opened, but the increasing number of towels used necessitated the occasional employment of additional help in the towel laundry, and induced the Commissioners to ask the Vestry to enter into an arrangement for the work on something like a commercial basis. The larger number of laundry tickets issued may be in part accounted for by the closing for several months of the public washhouses in Endell Street for extensive alterations. At the end of the year, however, the number of tickets issued each day compared favourably with previous years. The increase in the expenditure (£2,945 3s. 3d., compared with £2,671 lis. lid. for 1890) occurs under two or three heads only, and admits of easy explanation. Thus the continued fog of the winter 1890-91 frequently rendered it necessary to burn gas throughout the building during the whole day; the additional cost of water is due to the Grand Junction Water Company having terminated the former advantageous arrangement as stated in last year's report, and requiring payment according to the quantity registered by meter; the alteration to the bath money-taker's office, as explained last year, has enabled the 'Commissioners to dispense with the services of one of the moneytakers; and the repairs to the water mains were rendered necessary by the bringing into use of a second main which had 31 been out of use for some time, and by advantage being taken of the repaving of Dufour's Place to strip the mains and carry out the necessary repairs before the roadway was concreted and asphalted. The alterations to the money-taker's office and the repairs to the water mains together representing an expenditure of £208 5s. 5d., are of an exceptional nature; deducting these items, the ordinary expenditure, in spite of the increased cost of water, exhibits practically no increase. The Commissioners have the satisfaction to report that, after more than two years' deliberation and negotiation, the new swimming bath is in a fair way of completion for use early next season. The new bath will occupy, as the Vestry are aware, the site of Nos. 14 and 15, Marshall Street, two freehold houses belonging to the parish and adjoining the existing building southward. It was necessary to obtain the sanction of the Local Government Board, to the appropriation of these two houses for the purpose proposed, the Yestry having already assented thereto. Upon application being made to the Local Government Board for their sanction, the Commissioners were asked for their observations upon a memorial which had been sent to the Board by 16 ratepayers objecting to the proposal. The memorial totally misrepresented the intentions of the Commissioners, and the Commissioners therefore asked the Board to hold a public inquiry in order that the facts might be fairly stated, and the real views of the ratepayers ascertained. A local inquiry was accordingly held at the Yestry Hall, Piccadilly, on the 20th March, by J. T. Harrison. Esq., one of the Board's inspectors. Notice of the inquiry had been widely given throughout the Parish, but only three ratepayers attended to object. The following figures which were put in at the Inquiry show the boon the Baths and Washhouses have been to the poorer classes of the parishioners, and the comparatively small burden imposed on the ratepayers thereby:— Cost of erecting (in 1851), furnishing, and extending (in 1861) the establishment £21,000 0 0 Amount borrowed 21,000 0 0 Interest paid on loan until its repayment 13,062 5 10 Total £34,062 5 10 32 Total payments from the Poor Rate £34,971 10 1 Less—Surplus receipts paid at various times by the Commissioners in relief of the Poor Rate 9,350 0 0 Net charge on the Poor Rate (spread over a period of 36 years) £25,621 10 1 Number of Tickets issued to Washers from the 14th June, 1852, to the 31st December, 1890 1,954,179 Number of Bath Tickets issued during the same period 4,423,394 Total number of Tickets issued 6,377,573 Total Receipts from Bathers and Washers from the 14th June, 1852. to the 31st December, 1890 £115.806 19s. 0d. These figures tell their own story. It may, however, be remarked that for £25,621 10s. 1d. the ratepayers have obtained a freehold building, unencumbered by debt, and probably fully worth that sum. The present swimming bath is an iron tank measuring about 40ft. by 30ft. It is almost exclusively used by boys, and far from conforms with modern ideas. There is, moreover, no swimming bath in the neighbourhood available for ladies. The outside estimate for constructing the bath and and all expenses incidental thereto was placed at the inquiry at £6,000, and as the Commissioners had in hand upwards of £1.000, and the Yestry had provided a sum of £2,000 for the space to be added to the stoneyard by the basement under the bath, there only remained £3,000 to be provided, which it was proposed should be borrowed and repaid by equal instalments extending over 10 years. The first year's charge in respect of the loan for principal and interest would be about £400, and and the working expenses of the new bath were estimated at £250, making a total of £650. The receipts from the Baths and Washhouses exceed the normal expenditure by about £300 a year, so that in order to make the accounts balance it will be 33 necessary only to take £350 a year in the new bath, assuming" that the receipts and expenditure in respect of the existing building remain at their present amount. The witnesses called in support of the proposal were the Chairman of the Commissioners, the Superintendent of the Baths, and the Vestry's Surveyor, who had prepared a sketch plan. Two ratepayers only objected, and at the close of the proceedings the Inspector stated that he had held many similar inquiries,but did not call to mind one in which it had been so clearly shown that a bath would impose so small a burden, if any, on the ratepayers; he would report to the Local Government Board,who would give their decision indue course. The Board subsequently intimated that having considered the report of their inspector they saw no reason why the proposal should not be assented to, but that they would withhold their formal decision until they had received the plan, specification, and estimate agreed to by the Yestry. The Commissioners asked the pleasure of the Vestry as to engaging an architect to prepare detailed plans and specification, and, in the exercise of the discretion given to them by the Vestry, engagediMessrs. Spalding and Cross, the architects of the Hampstead and other public baths, to carry the matter through. The plans, specification, and estimate were submitted to and approved by the Vestry in July, and immediately forwarded to the Local Government Board. After an interval of some weeks, no doubt due to the summer recess, the Board issued their formal orders authorising the construction of the proposed bath on the site of 14 and 15, Marshall Street, and the borrowing of £3.000 towards defraying the cost thereof. Tenders were invited by public advertisement, and that of Messrs. Gould and Brand, of Kentish Town, was accepted at £5,632 17s. 4d. The work is now in hand, but certain details, such as the best means of communication between the stoneyard and the basement, and one or two questions of lights of minor importance, are necessarily reserved for further consideration as the works progress. The Commissioners venture to hope that the bath, although not of very considerable size, will be so complete in all its details, as to attract ladies and gentlemen in large numbers. Three Commissioners (Mr. James Malin, Mr. Styles, and Mr. Tapping) retired by effluxion of time in January. Mr. c 34 Malin and Mr. Tapping were re-elected for the usual term of office, and Mr. Truman was elected in the place of Mr. Styles. A list of the Commissioners is given on page 11, and a statement of their receipts and expenditure for the year 1891, and the number of bathers and washers, on pages 184 and 185. ARCHBISHOP TENISOJNTS SCHOOL. Three of the Trustees of Archbishop Tenison's United Schools for the parishes of St. Martin-in-tlie-Fields and St. James are elected by the Vestry. A vacancy occurred during the year by the expiration of the term for which Mr. Crane had been elected, and was filled up by the unanimous re-appointment of that gentleman. Mr. Crane, however, died shortly afterwards, and has been succeeded by Mr. Tysall. A statement of the Accounts of the Schools for the year 1891 is given on page 187. BURLINGTON SCHOOL. This School is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in the year 1875, and two of the Governors are elected by the Vestry. The present representative Governors are Mr. F. H. Bingham and Mr. Joseph Pool. The school fees, which are payable in advance at the commencement of each term, are as follows:— Entrance, os. for one pupil, and 2s. 6d. for each additional pupil from the same family. 35 Tuition for a pupil entering the school above the age of 10 years £1 10s. 0d. per term. If more than one pupil from the same family, £1 5s. 0d. for each beyond the first. For a pupil entering the school under the age of 10 years, £1 5s. 0d. per term, so long as she shall continue in the school. Dinners are supplied at 7d. each, or 2s. 6d. for the week of five days. Application for admission should be made to the Head Mistress at the School House. Old Burlington Street, where particulars of the course of study may be obtained. A statement of the Accounts of the School for the year 1891 is given on page 188. THE CRAVEN PEST HOUSE CHARITY. Five Parishes participate in the benefits of this Charity, viz., St. Martin-in-the-Fields, St. George, Hanover Square, St. Clement Danes, St. Paul, Covent Garden, and St. James. Four of the Trustees are appointed on the nomination of the Vestry, the present Trustees so appointed being Mr. J. Bonthron, Mr. W. Winnett, Mr. Tysall, and Mr. Truman. The two last mentioned gentlemen were appointed during the year to fill vacancies caused by the death of Mr. R. W. • \J xJ Burgess and Mr Crane. The income of the Charity is applied, under an order of the Court of Chancery, to the maintenance of 24 beds in King's College Hospital and 16 in Charing Cross Hospital, for the reception of poor patients from the live parishes mentioned. The hospitals are also required to afford outtreatment to all poor persons resident in any of the five parishes, who may be sent by the Trustees. Parishioners c 2 36 requiring hospital treatment may obtain letters at any time during office hours, on application at the Vestry Hall. A copy of the Accounts of the Charity for the year 1891 is given on page 189. MRS. ANN NEWTON'S CHARITY. This Charity, for the apprenticing of one poor boy of St. James's annually from the Union School, which was formerly administered by the Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor, has, owing to the abolition of that Board, been placed, by an order of the Charity Commissioners, dated the 15th August, 1890, under the management of the Guardians of the Poor elected for this Parish. A copy of the Accounts for the year 1891 is given on page 192. LE QUAINTER'S CHARITY. The only Charity which is administered by the Vestry is that known as Le Quainter's. It arises from a bequest, in 1782, by Mr. Peter Le Quainter, formerly a resident in Piccadilly, who directed that the income should be "equally distributed at Christmas amongst twenty poor persons who are or have been housekeepers in the Parish of St. James, Westminster, and such as the Rector and Churchwardens, and the other gentlemen for the time being who shall compose the Vestry of the said Parish, shall deem to be proper objects, and the most deserving to partake of the same." The property of the Charity consists of £9,909 2s. 9d. Two and Three-quarters per cent. Annuities. 37 A statement of the Accounts for the past year is given on page 191. ST. MARTIN'S ALMSHOUSE AND PENSIONS CHARITY. This Charity is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in 1886, the governing body comprising ex-ofjicio, co-optative, and representative Trustees. Two of the latter are elected by the Yestry of this Parish, the present representatives being Mr. Morle and Mr. Winnett, both of whom were re-elected on the expiration of their term of office during the year. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1891 will be found on pages 196 to 199. OTHER PAROCHIAL CHARITIES. A list of other endowed Charities in which the Parish is interested is given on pages 200 to 207, and statements of the accounts on pages 190 to 195. THE CENSUS. The tenth enumeration of the inhabitants of Great Britain was taken on the 6th April, 1891, and the resident population of this Parish was then ascertained to be 24,993, or 4,948 less than in 1881. It will be seen from the following statement that not only has the resident population continuously decreased during the last 50 years, but 38 that the rate of decrease has been more rapid in each succeeding decade:— 1841, resident population 37,407 1851 „ „ 26,406 1861 „ „ 35,324 1871 ,, „ 33,619 1881 „ „ 29,941 1891 „ „ 24,993 The decrease within the last ten years is partly accounted for by the demolition of a large quantity of closely occupied property for street improvements, such as the formation of Shaftesbury Avenue, and the widening of Little Pulteney Street. At the same time, the continued increase in the rateable value of the Parish clearly shows that another cause of the diminishing residential population of the parish is in operation, viz., that buildings formerly occupied as dwellings are being replaced by warehouses and business, premises commanding a higher rent. As the centre of trade extends, this condition of things must be expected to continue, just as the increasing volume of trade has converted the City of London, at night, from a populous place to little more than a city of caretakers. The following figures give the number of inhabited houses and inhabitants in each of the four wards of the Parish:— Houses. Inhabitants. Pall Mall Ward 493 3,682 Church Ward 604 3,742 Golden Square Ward 654 6,436 Great Marlborough Ward 841 11.133 Total 2,592 24,993 39 Any deductions from the Census Returns as to the prosperity of the Parish will, however, prove misleading, if regard is not had to the fact that an enormous number of people are engaged in business in the Parish during the day-time, and reside elsewhere. Of these, the Census takes no account whatever. FINANCIAL. Poor Rate.—This Account commenced with a balance of £1,184 lis. l0d. due to the Treasurer, the receipts during the year amounted to £94,502 13s. 2d., and expenditure to £91,750 7s. 2d., leaving a balance of £2,806 6s. 0d., in hand at the close of the account at Lady-day. At the last-mentioned date botli the assets and liabilities on this Account were unimportant in amount. Sewers and General Rate.—It will be seen on reference to the Accounts, commencing on page 164, that the year commenced with a balance in the Treasurer's hands amounting to £17,552 14s. 7d. The sum of £60,594 19s. 6d. was received during the twelve months, and the expenditure for the same period reached a total of £01,803 3s. 9d.„ leaving a balance of £16,344 l0s. 4d., on the 25th March, 1892. Against this cash balance, however, there were, on the last mentioned date, debts and liabilities properly chargeable to income amounting to £12,117 8s. 2d., with assets (exclusive of cash balance)estimated to realise £1,003 9s. 0d. leaving a surplus of £5,290 11s. 2d. to be carried to the credit of the present year. 40 LOANS. A statement of the Loan now outstanding is given on page 175. This Loan will have been extinguished before the publication of this Report. RATEABLE VALUE. The assessment of the Parish, as fixed at the general re-valuation in 1890, gave the following totals:— Gross value £889,049 Rateable value £743,348 The assessment of new buildings and alterations caused by variations in the value of old buildings during the following year has increased the total assessment of the Parish to the following amounts:— Gross value £899,208 Rateable value £751,255 RATES were made bv the Vestrv during the year as follows:— Amount in the Pound. s. d. Poor Rate (including-, in addition to charges for the Relief of the Poor, Police Rate, expenses of the London County Council, contributions to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and other general charges) 2 6 General Rate for the lighting,maintenance, repairing and cleansing of streets, watering carriageways, administration expenses, and precepts of the School Board of London 1 5 Sewers Rate, for the maintenance, repairing, and cleansing of sewers vested in the Vestry 0 1 Total 4 0 41 The rates for each of the two previous years were 3s. 11d. and 4s. 2d. in the pound respectively. The following statement shows the amount of the rates and the collection there of:— Poor Rate:— £ s. d.

For the convenience of Parishioners, however, it has become the practice to collect the rates in two half-yearly sums. 4 In view of the increasing demands bv Central ties over whose expenditure the vestry does not possess any control, although for economy in collection the funds are raised with the local rates, the following statement will be of interest to ratepayers:— Total amount expended, £157,069 19s. 10d.

It will be seen that of the total sum raised under the name of local rates, a very small proportion is applicable to strictly local expenditure, no less than £106,533 3s. 4d. of the total of £157,069 19s. 10d. having been paid over during the year to various authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry and other Parochial Boards have no control. In other words, out of every shilling raised as local rates in St. James's, less than fourpence is spent by the Parochial Authorities. LONDON COAL DUES. The Vestry have, in former Annual Reports, expressed their opinion that the discontinuance of the London Coal Dues has been detrimental to the London ratepayer, and of not the slightest benefit to the consumer of coal. *Including final precept for three months to Lady-day, 1889. making in all five quarters' expenses levied in one year. The duties of the Metropolitan Board of Works are now performed by the London County Council f Including expenses formerly paid by Metropolitan Board of Works. 44 Upon the invitation of the Kensington Vestry, delegates were appointed to attend a Conference for the purpose of considering as to action being taken for re-imposing the dues. At this Conference the following resolutions were n unanimously passed:— That this Conference of Delegates expressing the views of 19 parishes and districts of the Metropolis, having a population of over 1,564.431, and a rateable value of £11.841.332. is of opinion that the abolition of the Coal Dues has totally failed to afford the relief predicted at the time they were abolished, experience having clearly proved that not only has no gain come to the coal consumers of London, but that an appreciable increase has been caused by their abolition in the direct lccal taxation of the Metropolis, and a serious obstacle raised to the carrying out of important Metropolitan improvements. That this Conference, being fully convinced that the re-imposition of the dues would not be prejudicial to the coal consumers at large, but would afford a welcome relief to the heavilyburthened ratepayers of the Metropolis, is of opinion that it is highly desirable that steps should be taken with the object of restoring to the inhabitants of the Metropolis the benefits so long derived from the said dues, and that the London County Council and City Corporation be asked to co-operate in the movement. That a copy of the resolutions adopted by the Conference be forwarded to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as the representative of Her Majesty's Government, the London County Council, the Corporation of the City of London, and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. No effective steps have, however, been taken for renewing the dues. TAXATION OF GROUND RENTS. The Vestry had before them in the month of March a letter from the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, 45 expressing the opinion "that the ground rent ought to betaxed as well as the building rent, and that the revenue derived from this source should be devoted to the relief of local rates." The obvious reply to this resolution is that the ground rent is already assessed to the local rates, and the mere rating of the ground rent separately from the building rent would not increase the area of taxation, and consequently would not provide any revenue for the relief of local rates. The Vestry, however, regarded the resolution in question as intended to raise far wider issues than appear on the surface, and referred the whole subject to a Committee for consideration and report. The matter was still under consideration at Lady-day. So much misapprehension exists regarding the rating of ground rents or ground values, that the following Memorandum, prepared by the Vestry Clerk at the request of a Committee, is reproduced. The Memorandum was prepared for the purpose of information only, and has not been adopted by the Vestry; it is therefore not to be taken as. necessarily representing their views:— MEMORANDUM on Resolution of the Vestry of St. George's, Hanover Square, "That the Ground Rent ought to be taxed as well as the Building Rent, and that the Revenue derived from this source should be devoted to the relief of Local Rates," and questions raised on the Debate to refer the matter to a Committee of the St. James's Vestry. 1.—The ground rent is merged in the chief or rack rent i.e., the rent payable by a yearly tenant, and is therefore already rated, as well as the "building rent," consequently the rating of ground rents separately from the value of the building apart from the value of the site will not increase 46 the area of taxation by a single penny. At most it would only apportion the burden, in some fashion or other, between the freeholder and occupier. 2.—Assuming that it is thought desirable to apportion the rates between the owner and the occupier, it may well be asked in what respect does a ground rent differ from other forms of interest or annuity, such as those derived from mortgages, stocks, shares, and other securities ? For instance. A. B, and C, have each saved £1,000. A buy ground rents which return him 4 per cent, on the outlay. B buys railway stock, which pay the same percentage. C invests his £1,000 in a first mortgage at 4½ percent. interest. Why should A's investment of the result of his thrift, alone be held liable to local rates ? When A bought his ground rents, he did not calculate upon having to contribute to the local rates in respect of such ground rents any more than B and C expected to pay rates upon the interest of their investment. If he had, he would not have given so much for them. 3.—If we were starting as a community ab initio something might be said for apportioning the rates between owner and occupier, but the difficulties attending any such alteration now in the incidence of local taxation are forcibly illustrated in the Beport of the Local Government and Taxation Committee of the London County Council, dated the 26th June, 1891 (see, for example, paragraphs 9, 29, 34, and 35, &c.. &c.) Is it clear, moreover, that the owner would not recoup himself by an increased rent ? 4.—One instance of the rating of ground rents is given in paragraph 62 of the Beport. Let us take Sir George Trevelyan's house, which has been referred to in the newspapers in connection with this question, for the purpose of illustration. He is said to pay a ground rent of £25, and the house (of course including the site) to be assessed to local rates at £425. Assuming the rates in 1870, or at whatever date the taxation of the ground rents is to date from, were 3s. 47 In the pound, and in 1893 are 5s. in the pound, the following would be the result:— £ s. d. Sir George would add to his rent half rates at 3s. 31 17 6 But would deduct half rates at 5s. 53 2 6 Nett deduction 21 5 0 Leaving the freeholder to take £3 15s. 0d., instead of £25. If the rates were doubled, say increased from 3s. to 6s., the deduction would be £63 15s.. as against the addition of £31 17s. 6d., leaving the nett deduction for local rates alone £31 17s. 6d.,, or £6 17s. 6d. more than the annual ground rent. As the assessment of the house increases after the rating of ground rents becomes law, so also (according- to this plan) will the deduction to be made from the ground rent for local rates increase, although the freeholder cannot possibly derive any benefit from the increased value of the house during the existence of the lease. Again, suppose the ground rent stood in proportion to rack rent, as £25 to £250 when the house was built, on what principle can a deduction of rates on an assessment of £450 be justified when the ground rent remains unaltered ? The ground rent is only part of the consideration given for the use of the land; the sum expended in the erection of the building is also part of the consideration. The purchaser of a lease does not buy the bricks and mortar but only the right to occupation during the term of the lease. 5.—The above illustration shows the difficulty of adopting the particular proposal suggested in the Report of the Committee of the County Council, but other inequalities would arise under some suggested methods of rating ground rents. For example, when an estate is let on a building agreement an aggregate ground rent for the whole of the land is fixed. As the houses are built and leases granted the ground rent is usually apportioned unequally; thus some houses have a ground rent of 10s. only, which is a common minimum reserved by the agreement while others of equal or possibly less value will carry a ground rent of £2. £5. or even £25. It is clear that under the proposal of the Committee of the London County Council, a man who purchased a low ground rent two or three years ago would stand at a 48 disadvantage compared with the purchaser of a high ground rent. He might, in fact, be deprived of the whole of the income which he had purchased. Under some suggested methods of rating ground rents, or "ground values." this disadvantage would be felt by the occupier, and the disadvantage would be increased in cases where the lease of property in an improving district had been purchased at some interval after the erection of the house, because the purchaser would have paid a larger premium on account of the low ground rent, while he would also pay a larger proportion of local rates than if he had paid a smaller premium and stood at a higher ground rent. Another element of inequality is the disproportion between ground rent and rack rent in the case of old leases, say those granted 50 years ago, compared with new leases. 6.—The report of the County Council does not suggest how improved, or leasehold, ground rents, rent charges, or premiums, which are capitalised rent, are to be rated. It Avould clearly be unjust to tax an owner in respect of a premium which has been received and expended by his predecessor in title from whom he has inherited the property. 7. — It has never yet been proposed to rate interest on mortgages. What is to hinder a freeholder from taking a premium of £1,000, or a mortgage (in lieu of a premium) for £1,000. and a ground rent of 20s. per annum, instead of a ground rent of £40 Avithout premium or mortgage. In the one case he might, under some suggested systems of rating ground rents, pay rates on £1, and under the latter on £40. In each case the balance of the rates levied on the house (and site) would be paid by the occupier. 8.—If "ground values," as distinguished from grounds rents, are to be assessed, how can the figure be arrived at except by some arbitrary valuation on a hypothetical basis ? 9. —Another practical difficulty which would have to be faced would arise in the case of incomes charged by a settlement upon a number of estates comprising both urban property, some let on a ground rent and some not so let, and 49 tural property let upon different conditions altogether, and extending over several counties in England and Scotland, or Ireland, in which the incidence of local taxation differs to a considerable extent. 10.—If ground rents are to be assessed to local rates some provision must be made for the owner of the ground rents (as distinct from mere occupation) to have a voice in the election of the local bodies which spend the money he will be called upon to pay. 11.—But will the rating of ground rents or "ground values" tend to the ultimate benefit of the occupier 1 When the reversion falls in and the freeholder lets his house to a yearly tenant there will be no ground rent to rate, because the tenant will pay one rent only, commonly called the rack rent. If the land is to be rated separately from the house, the freeholder is not likely to grant a tenancy for any lengthened period, because the portion of rent representing the hypothetical value of the land would be subject to a deduction of a fluctuating amount. By keeping the property in hand, or letting it on a short tenancy, the freeholder would be able to raise or lower his tenant's rent as the rates rise or fall. Bating the ground separately from the building and making the owner of the ground liable for rates in respect of the same without a possibility of contracting himself out of the liability, would, therefore, almost inevitably lead to the abolition of the leasehold system and considerably diminish both fixity of rent and security of tenure. 12.—It would, therefore appear, that the rating of ground rents or "ground values" is not likely to be of any benefit except to existing lessees and only then if existing contracts (including covenants to pay all rates) are violated. Wholesale legalised breach of contract is a serious step for a commercial community to take, and would form a precedent capable of indefinite application. In many, probably the majority, of cases, these contracts have been entered into by the present holders of leases with a full knowledge of the facts of the case, e.g., by taking an assignment of a lease and paying a D 50 premium proportionate to the annuity (or ground rent) secured by the lease to the ground landlord. The premium in this case goes to the assignor of the lease, and not to the freeholder. The assignor of the lease, who derives more immediate benefit from the development of the property than the freeholder, would not be touched by the rating of ground rents. 13.—The rating of ground rents or "ground values" would not touch what is probably the most serious case of hardship to retail traders throughout London, especially in the West End, where the rents are highest, namely, the large increase of rent frequently demanded of traders on the renewal of their leases if the traders are bound to the locality or, still more, to the identical premises for business reasons. In cases of this kind, the exacting landlord is invariably an intermediate lessor, and, speaking generally, a trader is treated on better terms when he requires a renewal of his lease if his premises form part of a large estate than if they belong to a needy freeholder. The rating of ground rents would not affect the intermediate lessor. 14.—The only remedy for the hardship mentioned in the preceding paragraph appears to be the conferring of jurisdiction upon the County Court Judge (or some similar tribunal) to fix the rent of business premises if an apparently excessive rent or premium is demanded on renewal. This jurisdiction need not extend to private houses, because mere residents are not tied to a locality like a trader who has identified his business with particular premises. The latter person is largely at the mercy of his lessor, for if he were to leave, an unscrupulous man might take the premises and carry on a similar business without paying a penny for goodwill, unless patent rights were involved, to the evident detriment of the original trader though he had removed but a short distance. The remedy suggested, however, is not free from objection. Leasehold enfranchisement would not be a remedy, but the abolition of sub-letting and speculation in lands and houses would be advantageous. In no case would there then be more than two persons interested in the holding, viz., the ground landlord 51 and the occupying tenant. The latter might either be the holder of a lease for any term, by grant, assignment, or inheritance, or a yearly tenant, but would under all circumstances hold direct from the freeholder. 15.—Other hardships incidental to the present system of leaseholds, such as claims for dilapidations on houses intended to be taken down for re-building, and claims for excessive rent for an intervening period of a few days between the expiration of a sub-lease and the commencement of a new lease granted by the freeholder direct to the then sub-lessee, would not be mitigated in the least by the rating of ground rents or " ground values." 16.— Judging from the debate which took place at the Vestry, on the 3rd March, upon the proposal to refer the resolution of St. George's Vestry to a Committee, the apportionment of the rates between the owner and the occupier is what is chiefly desired. This could be effected more easily by making a certain proportion of all or some or one of the local rates a charge upon the owner, but payable in the first instance by the occupier, than by any system of separately assessing the ground and the building. In such a case, moreover, the amount of the ground rent, the payment of premium, leasehold or improved ground rents, and other complications, need not enter into consideration. In equity, however, existing contracts should not be affected, seeing that owners, as such, are not represented on the spending bodies, and as regards future contracts, some provision should be made for such representation of owners. By owner," I mean the immediate lessor of the occupier, unless the latter holds the premises on a ground rent. 17.—To sum up, it is difficult to see what practical advantage occupiers would derive from the taxation of ground rents or "ground values," or even the apportionment of rates between occupier and owner as suggested in paragraph 10, unless the introduction of the system were accompanied by something akin to confiscation, while it is clear that any suah system would fail to benefit the trading classes under D 2 52 such circumstances as those mentioned in Paragraph 13 of this Memorandum. The occupier is the person who elects the spending bodies, and, theoretically at least, can control their policy. The owner of the ground rent has had no representation upon the bodies who have piled up the debt of the Metropolis, and it is questionable morality to make him responsible for debts he has had no part in incurring. Apart from considerations of morality, however, the practical question is, whether it does not best suit the purpose of the occupier to take upon himself the risk of increased rates to secure fixity of rent and security of tenure for an ascertained period. How could a large trader carry on business successfully if he could not count upon a continuance of his tenancy, at a rent fixed for a reasonable period in advance? THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL AND THE ASSESSMENT OF PROPERTY. The Vestry have given very careful consideration to certain suggestions which were formulated by a Committee of the London County Council for the amendment of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, and circulated among the Rating Authorities for their observations. The object of the suggested amendment of the law is to obtain a more equal rating of property throughout London, and as the ratepayers of St. James's, owing to the large rateable value of the Parish, are called upon to bear a larger proportion of common charges, compared with local charges, than probably any part of London, the City only excepted, any proposal to remove an inequality in the basis upon which these charges are raised, supposing such to exist, must necessarily command the sympathy of the Vestry. 53 The remedy proposed by the Committee of the County Council is to give the Council power to revise the totals of the Valuation List for each Parish, before the List is to be taken as conclusive for rating purposes, and for several reasons, this remedy does not commend itself to the Vestry. The fair and equal assessment of property is by no means an easy task to those possessing an intimate local knowledge, and the difficulties would be considerably increased if the duty were undertaken by a body necessarily not possessing much intimate knowledge. The length of time involved in the revision by one mind of the thousands of assessments in London would be enormous, and if the work were divided among several there would probably be no nearer approach to uniformity than now. At present, the parochial assessment is the outcome of joint, or separate, action of the Surveyor of Taxes, representing the Crown, and the Overseers, or body acting as Overseers, representing the Parish. The Vestry have no reason to believe that the assessment of any part of the Metropolis is unfairly made, for while the Overseers may desire to keep the rateable value of the locality as low as possible, it is clearly to the interest of the Crown to raise the assessment of properties assessable to Income Tax or House Duty. The County Council, however, entertain a different opinion, and are incurring considerable expense in appealing against the totals of the Valuation Lists of some Parishes. In this Parish, objections have been made to certain assessments by the County Council, as being too low, and by the person assessed, as being excessive. It is probable, therefore, that substantial justice is done by fixing the amount of the assessment at something between the two, and what is done in this Parish it is fair to assume is the practice generally. 54 The Vestry see no reason why the County Council should not, as regards the preparation of the Valuation Lists, be placed in the same position, relatively to the Overseers and the Assessment Committee, as that occupied by the Surveyor of Taxes. A third copy of the Valuation List would have to be prepared, and power conferred upon tha County Council to object to the amount at which it is proposed to fix either the gross or rateable value of any hereditament. In this Parish, the Surveyor of Taxes is invited to attend all meetings of the Committee of Vestry acting as Overseers when the assessment of property is under consideration. This practice has been found most advantageous; the Surveyor of Taxes ascertains the principles upon which the Committee proceed, and unnecessary objections are therefore prevented, while on the other hand the Committee are frequently put in possession of facts by the Surveyor of Taxes, of which they would otherwise remain ignorant. If the law were amended so as to place the County Council on the same footing as the Surveyor of Taxes, as above suggested, their representative could, in like manner, be present when the assessments were under consideration. VESTRY PROPERTY. Vestry Hall.—The Vestry Hall and offices were cleaned as usual during the summer recess, at a cost of £39 10s., and the settees, chairs, and tables in the Vestry Hall were re-covered and repaired by Messrs. H. & J. Cooper, at a cost of £87 15s. Stables and Stoneyard.—Certain alterations, necessitated by the proposed extension of the Stoneyard under the Swimming Bath now in course of erection have been carried out, at a cost of £223 6s. 9d. The formation of the approach to the extension of the stoneyard will involve the removal of the Disinfector and its re-erection on another site, and, possibly, some further rearrangement of the stoneyard and office. Disinfector.—The Disinfector has been used for disinfecting bedding, clothing, &c., for parishioners on 57 occasions, compared with the same number in 1890-91, and 51 in 1889-90. * Mortuary.—The bodies of 37 persons have been received into the Mortuary during the year, as compared with 24 during the previous twelve months. Medical men, the clergy, district visitors, and others who •are specially brought into contact with the poor, are invited to assist the Vestry in preventing the spread of disease which may arise from the retention of a corpse in a room occupied perhaps by a number of people in a thicklypopulated neighbourhood, by making known, as occasion requires, the provision made for the reception of bodies in a decent manner, and with all possible deference to the natural feelings of the bereaved relatives. As the main object of providing a Mortuary and Disinfecting Apparatus is to protect the parishioners at large against the spread of infectious disease, either may be used without charge. Information as to the mode of proceeding in such a case may be freely obtained at the Vestry Hall. 55 56 OTHER PARISH PROPERTY. Eleven freehold houses on the east side of Marshall Street were purchased in the year 1819, for parochial purposes. Two of the houses are now absorbed into the Workhouse premises, the site of three others has been utilized for the erection of the Public Baths and Washhouses, and anew swimming bath is in course of construction on the site of two others. The remaining four houses are let on repairing agreements. The rent received for these four houses, together with the sum receivable from the Westminster Union in respect of that portion of the Workhouse premises belonging to the Parish of St. James, is applied in aid of the Poor Rate. SCAVENGING, DUST REMOVAL, &c. Under the system adopted by the Vestry, the roadsweepers are employed and paid by the Vestry, but the collection and removal of house dust, street refuse, &c., are done under contract. The total cost of scavenging and dust removal for the past year, as given in the accounts, was £6,769 4s. 5d., compared with £7,008 19s. 4d. for the previous year. In anticipation of the expiration of Messrs. Mead's contract for street cleansing and dust removal at Lady-day, tenders for the work were invited by advertisement in December. All the tenders received exhibited a considerable advance in price, and, after some deliberation, the the tender sent in by Messrs. Mead & Co., for the sum of £5,900 per annum, for three years, was accepted. The 57 agreed sum is £1,400 per annum in excess of the recently expired contract, and £2,700 per annum more than the previous contract. The following is a statement of the number of loads reported to have been removed from the parish during the year:— Cart Loads. Wagon Loads. Dust 10,156 Slop 536 5,621 The cost of Street Watering last year was £965 9s. 3d., or £80 15s. l1d. more than in 1890-91. WORKMEN'S SICK FUND. A sick fund, on the principle of a slate club, limited to the Vestry's workmen, has been in operation since the 1st August, 1887. The Vestry contribute the sum of 5s. a week to the funds of the club, in lieu of allowing sick pay to individual workmen. The bulk of the surplus is divided among the members at Christmas in the usual way, but one of the rules requires that a balance of not less than £10 be carried forward at the end of each year to provide for the payment of sick allowances before sufficient has been received from members' subscriptions to meet necessary outgoings. REMOVAL OF SNOW. In anticipation of the approach of winter, the Vestry sought and obtained permission from the Thames Conservators and the London County Council, to cast clean snow over the parapet of the Victoria Embankment into the 58 river. The steps taken for cleaning the streets after each snowfall during the past winter are mentioned in the Surveyor's Report. The direct cost to the ratepapers of removing the snow amounted to £464 12s. 9d. SLIPPERY ROADS. At the approach of winter, the Vestry received, with much satisfaction, an intimation from the Commissioner of Police that his officers had been instructed to report to the Vestry, without delay, any road which was in a slippery or dangerous condition. The arrangements made by the Vestry for maintaining the thoroughfares in the Parish in a fit state for traffic under all conditions of weather appear, however, to be adequate, as not a single report was received from the police during the entire winter. These arrangements include the provision of a supply of ballast at the refuges at frequent intervals, not only to facilitate the spreading thereof on the roadway by the Vestry's servants, but also to enable carmen and drivers to use the ballast in case of emergency, such as a sudden frost. The Vestry had under consideration at Lady-day the construction of a small pit for the storage of ballast immediately in the rear of the Guards' Memorial, with a view to obviate the objection taken by the First Commissioner of Works to ballast being deposited on the roadway of Waterloo Place. 59 CONTRACTS FOR WORKS AND MATERIALS. Particulars of the various contracts entered into or continued during the year are given on pages 179 and 180. STREET LIGHTING. On the 25th March, 1891, there were 818 public lamps in the various thoroughfares of the Parish, and this number was increased by 2 during the year. At Lady-day, 1892, there were 784 ordinary street lamps (460 burning cannel gas, and 324 burning common gas), 4 urinal lamps, and 32 larger lamps attached to refuges, making a total of 820. The ordinary street lamps are lighted, extinguished, and cleansed by the Gas Company, at an inclusive sum of £2 17s. Od. for cannel, and £2 17s. 8d. for common gas per lamp per annum. The light given is practically identical, 4ft. of cannel gas being supplied per lamp per hour, and 5ft. of common gas. As regards the refuge lamps, payment is made according to the consumption of gas as registered by meter. The total cost of street lighting for the past year amounted to £2,666 17s. 9d., as compared with £2,658 6s. 8d. for the previous twelve months. This sum is exclusive of maintenance, repairs, and new lamp.posts, lanterns and fittings, which cost a further sum of £422 10s. lOd. The Vestry have entered into a fresh arrangement with Messrs. R. and J. Shiers for the maintenance of street lanterns, &c.,at the under-mentioned rates, the arrangement being terminable, as before, on the 25th December in any year :— 60 Per annum. 16in. lantern and column 5/2 14 in. „ „ 5/2 16in. „ and bracket 4/11 14in. „ „ 4/11 "Metropole lanterns, and bracket or column 5/9 "Victoria " lanterns, and bracket or column 5/9 Refuge lanterns and column 17/- Metropolitan Board pattern lantern and column 8/3 Keeping in repair or supplying new governors and burners as required to refuge lamps 2/6 Ditto ditto other meter lamps 2/6 Ditto ditto meter fittings 5/- Cleaning services of 7/6 Burning off and painting lamp column 7/6 INCREASED COST OF GAS. The further increase in the charge made by the Gas Light and Coke Company to private consumers has naturally excited some attention. It may therefore be useful to briefly refer to the powers which the Company possess to increase their charges. The charge for gas to private consumers in this Parish is governed by the 19th section of the Gas Light and Coke Company's Act, 1876 (39 and 40 Vic., Cap ccxxv.), which fixes the standard, or initial, price of common gas at 3s. 9d. per 1,000 cubic feet, subject to a decrease or increase of one penny per 1,000 feet for every addition or reduction of five shillings per cent. in the standard rate of dividend of 10 per cent. The charge for cannel gas follows the same rule, and varies according to the relative illuminating power of common and cannel gas. 61 The practical result of this enactment is that if the Company pay a dividend of 10 per cent. to their ordinary shareholders they may charge 3s. 9d. per 1,000 feet for common gas. If their profits enable them to pay 11 per cent. they must reduce their charge to 3s. 5d.; if, on the other hand, profits fall off and only admit of a dividend of 9 per cent. the price of gas may be raised to 4s. 1d. per 1,000 feet. The above-mentioned provision does not apply to the charge for gas supplied to public lamps, which is regulated by a provision in an Order in Council, dated the 22nd May, 1883, confirming the scheme for the amalgamation of the London Gas Light Company with the Gas Light and Coke Company. The charge for public lighting is thereby fixed for the whole of London at the lowest rate in force, for the time being, for private lighting in any part of London. The South Metropolitan Gas Company have not seen the necessity of increasing their charge to private consumers, consequently the cost of public lighting north of the Thames remains unaltered. PRIVATE LAMPS The Vestry some years since decided not to permit the erection of Private Lamps, except upon the following conditions :— 1. That no part of such Lamps shall be less than 10 feet in height from the public footway. 2. That no such Lamps shall in any case project further than the inside of the kerb bounding the footway. 62 3. That all such Lamps shall be entirely free from writing or any trade devices, except in such cases as Medical Men, Post Offices, Sweeps, Fire Engines, or other positions where they would be a public guide in cases of emergency. 4. That no such Lamps shall be suspended by ball and socket joint only. 5. That no Lamps on posts be agreed to unless they are kept lighted the whole night. 6. That a sketch of the proposed Lamps with their dimensions and of any intended inscription thereon, be submitted with the application to the Vestry for approval. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. As explained in last year's Report, the Parish is supplied with the electric light upon two totally distinct systems, either of which is available for any parishioner, subject to certain specified conditions.. Certain complaints which have been received of offensive smells and the diffusion of partly consumed coal dust, supposed to proceed from the generating station in Mason's Yard, are still engaging the attention of the Vestry. DAMAGE BY ELECTRIC LIGHT MAINS. The occurrence of two explosions in the month of September, at short intervals, in distributing boxes belonging; to the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company indicated a possible source of danger to the public, which appeared to demand searching inquiry, with a view of ascertaining whether the regulations made by 63 the Board of Trade for securing the safety of the public were adequate, and what (if any) further precautionary measures were necessary. The facts which the Vestry brought under the notice of the Board of Trade are as follows:— In the afternoon of the 14th September the cover of a Distributing Box almost immediately in front of the Vestry Hall was observed to be hot and dry, notwithstanding rain was falling at the time. The attention of the Company was at once called to the matter by the Vestry's general foreman, but although it was evident that there was great heat in the box, no precaution was adopted against accident, or any step taken by the Company, so far as the Vestry are aware, until early the following morning. It was then found, the Vestry understand, that water was in the conduit to a sufficient depth to connect the conductors, with the result apparently that some of the water had been resolved into its constituent gases by electrolysis. A naked light was put into the conduit and an explosion occurred. About six o'clock in the morning of the 29th September an explosion occurred in a distributing box at the corner of Duke Street and Jermyn Street, the explanation given by the Company being that coal gas from a leaky main had penetrated into the conduit, and had been fired by a pilot wire which had given way. "The Regulations made by the Board of Trade for preventing accidents of the kind are as follows:— 64 All conduits used as receptacles for conductors shall be constructed of durable material and of ample strength to resist any pressure due to heavy traffic or other forces to which they may be expected to be subjected. Where the conductors in any conduit are not continuously insulated, adequate precautions shall be taken to ensure that no accumulation of water shall take place in any part sufficient to raise the level of the water into contact with the conductors. All conduits for conductors constructed in streets in which gas mains are also laid shall be efficiently protected against an accumulation of gas. All street boxes shall be efficiently protected against an accumulation of gas or water, and their covers so secured that they cannot be opened except by means of a special appliance. Upon careful consideration of all the circumstances, the Vestry could come to no other conclusion than that these Regulations had been disregarded by the Company, and in view of the disastrous results likely to arise if an explosion under the surface of the street were to occur in a crowded thoroughfare like Piccadilly, when the roadway was thronged with vehicles and the footway with pedestrians, the Vestry requested the Board of Trade to hold an Inquiry into the matter. An Inquiry was accordingly held on the 3rd November by Major Cardew, R.E., Electrical Adviser to the Board of Trade, and on the 18th of the same month the Board forwarded to the Vestry the following copy of Major Cardew's Report:— [Copy]. Report on an Inquiry into the causes of two explosions which have recently occurred in the Conduits carrying the mains of the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company, Limited, and on precautions necessary to prevent similar accidents in future. 65 To the Assistant Secretary (Railway Department) Board of Trade. Sir, I have the honour to report that, in accordance with your direction, I have to-day made an inquiry, as above, at the offices of the St. James's, &c., Company. Besides the Company, the London County Council and the Vestry of St. James, Westminster, were represented. I found that there was no dispute as to the facts, which the Company admitted were accurately set forth in the letter from the St. James's Vestry to the Board of Trade, dated 20th October, 1891, except that it appeared that in the case of the accident which happened on the 14th September last the Company had a tent erected over the position of the. street box, the cover of which showed signs of internal heating, as soon as their attention was drawn to it by the Vestry, and stationed a watchman at the point. The full facts of this accident are as follows : — The conduit and mains in this part of Piccadilly were laid down before the Company obtained a Provisional Order under the powers conferred by a licence. The Company were advised that these powers did not authorise them to interfere with the service pipes of gas or water companies. Consequently, in place of laying their conduit in a straight line, they have avoided these obstructions by winding the conduit, as a rule, in a vertical plane. This gave rise to numerous depressions or inverted syphons of rather sharp curvature in the line of the main between street boxes. Any water finding its way into the conduit would naturally collect at the lowest points of these depressions, and a small quantity of water would thus be sufficient to fill the conduit up to the level of the conductors when the curvature was sharp. Such a depression existed close to the street box where heating was observed, the street box being considerably above the level of the lowest point of the conduit. The water appears to have found its way in owing to a temporary saturation of the soil by a defect in a service pipe to a hydrant in close proximity. The conductors were probably completely submerged for several yards. E 66 This gave rise to a large electrical current through the water between the various conductors maintained at differences of potential from each other exceeding 100 and 200 volts respectively and between the outer conductors and the iron casing of the conduit at a pressure exceeding 100 volts. The very large metallic surfaces exposed and their proximity to each other, and the probable contamination of the water with metallic oxides and salts, are sufficient reasons for assuming a large current, probably amounting to at least 100 amperes, and this is borne out by the results noted. The effects of such a current would be:— (1.) The rapid generation of hydrogen gas and to a less extent of oxygen also, part of the oxygen being absorbed by the metals. (2.) A rapid rise of temperature in the water up to the boiling point and in consequence the generation of steam. The steam would be re-condensed on the cooler metal surfaces as it travelled along the culvert, and in this way no doubt the cover of the street box was heated. The gases would remain in this condition, the hydrogen rising rapidly and mixing with the free oxygen and also with the oxygen of the air contained in the culvert, and in this way an explosive mixture was formed in the rising conduit and in another street box in the vicinity which occupies the apex of a steep ascent. In the night the Company sent men to examine the defect, and one of these men removed the cover of the street box. which was charged with an explosive mixture of gases, and attempted to examine it with a naked light. The result was an explosion which was, luckily, without any more serious result than the slight displacement of the stone paving for some yards. The causes of this accident are evidently:— (1.) That the Company had not taken adequate precautions to ensure that no accumulation of water should take place in this part of their conduit sufficient to raise the level of the water into contact with the conductors as they are enjoined to do by regulation, and that in consequence of this neglect on their part, combined with the occurrence of a serious leakage of water from a defective service pipe, an accumulation of water did occur. 67 (2.) That a naked light was brought into contact with an explosive mixture of gas. The second accident occurred about six o'clock on the morning of the 29th September last, and was of an extremely serious nature. The facts are accurately described in the letter from the County Council dated 20th October. 1891. The ignition of the explosive mixture in the street box was, it appears, undoubtedly caused by a breakdown in a pilot wire, i.e., an insulated wire connecting a distant point on the system of distribution with the central station by means of which the exact pressure at the distant point is indicated at the station. I attach a piece cut from this pilot wire where the fault occurred. The wire is insulated and then coated with lead. There appears to have been a defect in the insulation at this point very possibly caused by a sharp kink, and an electric arc was formed, shown by the fusion of the end of the conductor. The causes of this accident are:— (1.) That the Company had not efficiently protected this street box against an accumulation of gas as required by regulation, and that in consequence of this neglect on their part an accumulation of gas did occur in it. (2.) That a failure of insulation occurred in the pilot wire, giving rise to an electric arc in contact with an explosive mixture of gas. PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN. It will be observed that in the case of each accident it is evident that a principal cause was the failure on the part of the Company to comply with the regulations imposed upon them by the Board of Trade, and the most obvious precaution to be taken is a more strict compliance with these regulations. The exact dangers, the existence of which has now been forcibly demonstrated, were clearly foreseen in framing the regulations, which were purposely left in a general form in order that the judgment of the Company's engineers might not be fettered in suiting their precautionary measures to the exigencies of each particular case. E 2 68 The fact that the soil of many London streets is saturated with gas and that they are liable to floods from breaks in water pipes, stoppages in sewers, &c., were certainly within the cognizance of the engineers to the Company long previous to these accidents. Were the Company to maintain that they had taken all possible precautions against these accidents it would be a matter for serious consideration whether the approval of the Board of Trade should not at once be withdrawn from a system of laying mains which has been shown to contain elements of danger, and the Vestry of St. James submitted this point for consideration. I did not. however, gather from the representatives of the Company that this was their contention, but their defence rather took the line of admitting incomplete precautions and urging in extenuation that the mains were laid originally under incomplete powers, that the demand upon them for supply had rather overtaxed their resources, while the difficulties in the way of executing street work in the district are very considerable, and in consequence the precautionary measures had to some extent fallen into arrears. The Company had to my knowledge not been entirely indifferent to their responsibilities in the matter of keeping their conduits free from gas and water, as their representatives have on several occasions conferred with me on the subject. It was agreed informally between us that the Company should carry out a system of providing at each street box and point of depression in their culverts an inverted syphon. [Major Cardew annexed a sketch to illustrate this suggestion.] I consider that this system should be completely carried out without further delay, and should be completed in three months' time at latest. Another precaution I recommend in this case is that no great length of conduit should be allowed to remain without a break of continuity formed by substituting a short piece of cable mains for the conduit mains. This is already being done by the Company at road crossings for other reasons, and I recommend that in the case of this Company's conduits no greater length should be allowed without such a break of continuity than 200 yards. It will, however, be necessary to allow the 69 Company time to carry this out without inconvenience to the public and their customers, I should say it could be conveniently accomplished within six months. A third precaution which has been already provided to some extent at any rate by the Company, is to provide at all street boxes simple means of making a disconnection in the mains. As all the mains of this Company are laid as all mains should be, without free ends, in case of any sudden local irruption of water the portion of main affected could be readily cut off without affecting customers on either side. Had this been done at once in the case of the first accident, when the Company were notified that something was wrong, the explosion would have been prevented and a serious waste of energy saved to the Company. I have seen at the office of the Company a very efficient arrangement for providing the requisite facilities for cutting off rapidly. A fourth precaution which should certainly be. taken is to avoid in future any depression in the level of the conduit between street boxes, so that any water should accumulate in these boxes and not at intermediate points. A fifth precaution in view of the second accident is that the Company should at once remove all pilot wires from the interior of their conduits. The sample shows clearly how liable to injury these wires must be. These wires have been, I am informed, already disconnected, but even in this condition might become sources of danger in the vicinity of bare conductors. The Company now consider them unnecessary, at any rate so far as their present system extends, and any that are required in future can be laid outside the conduits. With the precautions detailed above, I do not think it will be necessary for the Board of Trade to reconsider their approval of the system of laying bare mains in conduits for low pressure supply, which has undoubted advantages, at any rate until a longer experience has been acquired of the durability of insulated cables under the conditions of a constant supply of electrical energy. 70 The dangers to be guarded against in the conduit system are thoroughly understood and clearly expressed in the Board of Trade regulations. It is, however, very important that these regulations should be thoroughly carried into effect by the companies concerned. I have, &c., (Signed) P. CARDEW, Major, R.E. A copy of a communication addressed by the Board of Trade to the Company was forwarded with the foregoing Report, as follows :— BOARD OF TRADE, (RAILWAY DEPARTMENT), London, S.W.. 18th November, 1891.. ST. JAMES'S ELECTRIC LIGHTING ORDER, 1890. Sir.— I am directed by the Board of Trade to forward to you to be laid before your Directors the enclosed copy of a report made to this Department by Major Cardew, R.E., after his inquiry into the causes of the explosions which recently occurred in the mains of your Company. I am, at the same time, to point out that it appears from the report that your Company have failed to comply with the Regulations for the protection of the public safety imposed upon them by this Department under the above mentioned order, and have thereby rendered themselves liable under .section 51 of the Order, to the penalties prescribed by the regulations, and I am to ask whether the Company desire to submit any reasons why the Board of Trade should not take steps for the recovery of the penalties in question. I am also to inquire what steps the Company propose to take to give effect to the recommendations contained|in the Report. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) COURTENAY BOYLE. The Manager and Secretary, The St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company, Limited. 71 The Vestry understand that the Board of Trade did not take any proceedings for the recovery of the penalties referred to in the foregoing letter. Some further correspondence ensued with the Board of Trade on a suggestion that the regulations applicable to this particular Company should be supplemented so as to insure adequate precautions being taken by syphoning at frequent stated intervals, or otherwise, to prevent any accumulation of water or gas in the culverts or distributingboxes of the Company. The Board of Trade referred the matter to Major Cardew, whose memorandum on the point is as follows:— memorandum. The responsibility for exact compliance with regulations should rest on the undertakers. With regard to the proposal for issue of Supplemental Regulations, as the undertakers have stated that they are prepared to carry out the recommendations contained in my Report of 3rd November, 1891, and as I have visited their station on several occasions since this date and found that active steps in this direction are in progress, about 60 syphon drains having already been fixed, I do not consider it necessary to issue the proposed Supplemental Regulations. My Report shows that the accidents which have occurred were clearly due to ^attention to the regulations now imposed, and this has not been contested by the Undertakers. (Signed) P. CARDEW. 16th December, 1891. The Vestry had hoped that the action which was then taken in the matter would have been sufficient to ensure a due regard to the regulations which have been imposed 72 upon the Company by the Board of Trade, acting under the authority of Parliament, for the protection of the public safety. In the months of January, February, and March, however, the Vestry received complaints from certain ratepayers in Piccadilly that they had been compelled to frequently renew their water supply pipes, in one case as many as four times, since November. An inspection of the pipes removed from the ground led to the belief that the mischief was due to electrolytic action, and as neither of the two Electric Light Companies who have mains under the footway in the portion of Piccadilly referred to appeared to be disposed to uncover their mains for the purpose of examination for the evident leakage, the Vestry were driven to appeal to Major Cardew, R.E., for his assistance. The ground was accordingly opened, and the outer casing of both mains exposed and tested when a very perceptible leakage from the main of the St. James's and Pall Mall Company was at once manifested. The Vestry were so exceedingly dissatisfied with the Company for having sat with folded hands for some months, although the fact of a leakage in some part of their system must have been known to them, and the mischief in Piccadilly was localised between two of their distributing boxes, that they communicated officially with the Board of Trade on the subject. The reply of the Board of Trade, which took the form of a report from Major Cardew, was not received until after Lady-day, but it is of such great importance, especially in view of what transpired at the above-mentioned inquiry by Major Cardew in November, that it is given in full, as follows:— 73 My attention was called to this damage, and to two very similar cases of damage to water pipes, by Mr. Wilkins, clerk to the St. James's Vestry, on the 14th ult. It appeared that a lead water pipe supplying the premises of Mr. Barker, pastry cook, &c., whose shop is closely adjacent to that of Mr Peat, had been eaten through twice within a few months. I examined a piece of pipe which had been thus damaged, and the appearance was suggestive of electric action. Mr. Barker's employes also averred that they had sustained electric shocks from touching the handle of a water tap on a boiler in metallic connection with the lead pipe. As the possibility of electric shocks was a very serious matter, I lost no time in having the main of the London Electric Supply Corporation •exposed. This main terminates in a "dead end" nearly opposite Mr. Barker's shop, and I thought it possible that there might be serious leakage from this. But it turned out to be in very good order, and no shock whatever could be obtained from the outer casing of the main. The action on the water pipes also was much more likely to be occasioned by a main supplying continuous current. On the 29th March, I examined the gas meter on the invitation of the Chief Inspector, and its appearance was thoroughly in accordance with the theory of galvanic or electrolytic action as to the cause of the damage. Two holes had been eaten through the back of the meter where it had been in contact with a damp wall, the rest of the meter showing no sign of corrosion. On the 30th March I received an intimation from Mr. Wilkins that Mr. Barker's water service pipe had again failed. The ground was opened to remove the defective pipe, exposing a portion of the culvert of the St. James and Pall Mall Electric, Light Company, which was laid just above the water-pipe, and by means of a few tests with a galvanometer, I satisfied myself that there was a steady difference of potential of about six volts between the iron culvert and the water-pipe, the culvert being negatively charged as regards the pipe. 74 This appeared to me sufficient to account for the mischief, and I notified the Chief Engineer of the St. James, &c.. Company, of the results of my test, and requested him to give me notice when the culvert was opened, in order that I might be present. Accordingly I was informed that this would be done on the morning of the 5th instant. On account of some very important experiments with the new Standard Ampere Balance, I was unable to inspect the culvert until the afternoon, by which time it had been partially opened. There was a good deal of water in it, and in some places this had evidently touched the positive main. There were also three lead covered wires, which had been used as " pilot wires," lying loosely at the bottom of the culvert. Two of these wires had been fused evidently by a considerable current, and a g'ood deal of the insulation burnt as was evidenced by a sooty deposit on the main conductors, and the culvert at the spot. This had occurred at two separate places, one being near Mr. Barker's shop, and the other opposite Mr. Peat's. I have little doubt that a connection between the negative conductor, and the iron of the culvert was effected by the fused and stripped ends of these pilot wires. This is confirmed by the following facts:— At the time of my inquiry last November into the explosions which occurred on this Company's system of mains, I found that the insulation of the negative side of their system of mains from earth was very defective. This fault was very persistent, I but until the culvert was opened on the 5th instant it had not been localised and removed. Immediately, however, that this section of the main was disconnected to enable the culvert to be opened, the fault on the system disappeared, and the potential of the positive main from earth which had been persistently about 190 volts fell to about 110 volts. The explanation of the action is, I consider, this — The negative main has been, for some months, in metallic connection with the culvert in one, or, perhaps, two places in this part of Piccadilly. If the insulation of the positive side had been perfect, no electric action would have resulted. But this was not, and, in fact, practically could not be the case. 75 Consequently a leakage current was continually passing to earth from the negative at this place, and an equal current in the aggregate from the positive side through many small leaks. The lines of flow of current would be to absolute earth or zero potential in all directions. Any water pipes or gas pipes in the vicinity would be practically at zero potential throughout on account of their metallic connection with the whole mass of the water or gas mains of London. Consequently the lines of flow of current would, to a large extent, converge on any such pipes in the immediate vicinity, if only separated from the charged conduit by damp earth. In other words, there would necessarily be a flow of positive electricity from such pipes to the surrounding earth, and thence to the charged culvert. But the flow of positive electricity from a metal into a damp medium, or water, is always necessarily accompanied by the generation of oxygen at the surface of the metal, which, if oxydisable, is thereby corroded. This is the action which has destroyed the water pipes. The gas pipe happened to be laid in bitumen, and was thereby protected, but the gas meter, touching a damp wall within the influence of leakage, was affected. The state of the system of St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Supply Company, so far as it has been brought to my notice, may be briefly summed up as follows:— In September last two explosions occurred, due to accumulations of gas and water respectively, a faulty pilot wire causing the explosion of gas. On 3rd November I held an inquiry into these explosions, and from information given to me by the Engineer of the Company, I proposed a test, which was carried out shortly afterwards, and revealed the existence of a very serious earth connection on the negative main. This earth connection the Company were unable to localise and remove, and it continued in existence until the 5th inst., when it was removed by disconnecting the section of main opposite Mr. Peat's in Piccadilly. The local effect of this fault has been the damages now 76 reported oil, but it is certain that an equivalent oxydation of metal must have occurred on the positive main, or the house wires and apparatus connected with it. and it is not yet proved that this destruction has been so distributed as not to amount to material damage at any one point. On examination, it is again discovered that the fault originated in the pilot wires. In my Report of Inquiry I recommended that the Company should at once remove all pilot wires from the interior of their conduits. The Company stated, in answer to this, that they would, as far as possible, be removed, but that they found that the wires had, in many •cases, adhered firmly to the bottom of the culvert, and could, with difficulty, be removed These wires, however, in the portion of the culvert which was opened on the 5th instant did not appear to be adherent to the culvert in any part. The steps to be taken by the Board of Trade to provide against the recurrence of similar faults, and their consequences will, I think, require very mature consideration, but I have no hesitation in recommending that the Company should, without further delay, remove every portion of the pilot wires from their culverts, and should test throughout their -system of culverts for the existence of any appreciable difference of potential between the iron culverts and the gas and water pipes. (Signed) P. CARDEW. 8th April, 1892. The parishioners may rely upon the Vestry adopting further measures, in the light of the foregoing report, for the protection of private interests, but the precise course of action which may be ultimately adopted after the deliberation which the importance of the subject deserves will better form the subject of remark in the next Annual Report of the Vestry. 77 STREET NAMES. Orders have been made by the London County Council, and carried into effect by the Vestry, for re-naming streets and re-numbering premises, as follows :— New Name. Names Abolished. No. of Houses and other Buildings. Renumbered Broad Street None. 1 Carlton Mews Warwick Mews 5 Duck Lane None 18 Smith's Yard None 10 Wardour Mews None 18 STREETS PARTLY SITUATE IN OTHER PARISHES. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 6th March, 1857, placing that portion of Oxford Street which is situate in the Parish of St. James under the jurisdiction of the Vestry of St. Marylebone for all the purposes of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The cost of lighting, paving, cleansing, watering, &c., that portion of the thoroughfare is ascertained annually and paid by the Vestry. By an order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated the 10th August, 1866, specified sections of the following thoroughfares are placed under the exclusive management of the Vestries of St. James and St. George, Hanover Square, respectively, throughout the entire width thereof, 78 instead of according to the actual Parish Boundary, viz.:— Regent Street, Piccadilly, Burlington Gardens, St. James's Street, and Park Place. No payment is made by either Vestry to the other under this Order, the exchange of area being regarded as an equivalent. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 21st December, 1883, placing so much of the carriageway of Wardour Street as lies south of Meard's Court under the exclusive management of the Vestry for the purposes of cleansing and maintenance, and the remainder of the street under the exclusive management, for the same purposes, of the Strand District Board. An arrangement made some years since with the Vestry of St.Martin-in-the-Fields for the apportionment of Coventry Street as regards the cleansing and paving, in consequence of the boundary line being somewhat irregular, is still in force. PAVING AND DRAINAGE WORKS. Most of the paving and drainage works during the past year consisted of maintenance and repair, and details of the work will be found in the Surveyor's Report, commencing on page 147. The area of wood pavement was slightly extended and a small additional quantity of asphalte laid during the year. The tender of the Improved Wood Pavement Company was accepted for the former, and the tender of the French Asphalte Company for the latter. 79 CONSTRUCTION OF LOCAL SEWERS. In the month of May the Vestry received a circular letter from the London County Council inviting the cooperation of the local authorities in securing that local sewers shall be constructed only in accordance with the plans and sections approved by the Council. In accordance with the suggestions of the Council, the Vestry instructed their Surveyor to deposit with the Chief Engineer of the Council, within thirteen months after approval, copies of the approved plans and sections of such sewers with a certificate (assuming such to be the case) that the whole of the work has been carried out in accordance therewith. A month later, the Vestry received a further letter from the County Council suggesting that persons proposing to construct new sewers should be required to properly ventilate the same. The Vestry have already obtained the erection of ventilating pipes or shafts to local sewers at various points in the Parish, and informed the Council that their suggestion would be adopted, as a continuance of this policy, if occasion arises. PULTENEY STREET IMPROVEMENT. The Vestry have entered into an agreement with the Commissioners of Woods for the completion of this improvement. The Agreement provides that, subject to the new premises being fully licensed, the "Round House" public-house is to be re-erected to the line of frontage of the other build- 80 ings on the south side of Little Pulteney Street. The consideration on the part of the Vestry is payment of £300 and a covenant to carry out the necessary paving works. Some opposition was manifested to the transfer of the licence to the new premises, and the Vestry therefore decided to petition the Licensing Justices in favour of the transfer, on the ground that if the application were refused a much-needed street improvement would be indefinitely delayed, while the number of licensed houses would not be diminished, inasmuch as the "Round House" would be allowed to stand as at present. The licence to the proposed new premises was granted on the 18th March, and the improvement will probably be completed before next winter. REFUGES. Three additional Refuges have been formed during the year, all in connection with the re-paving of the Haymarket with wood. The following is a list of Refuges in the Parish:— Coventry Street, by the Haymarket. G-reat Marlborough Street. Haymarket, by Charles Street. „ by Coventry Street. „ by Pall Mall. Pall Mall, by the United Service Club. „ by the Athemeum Club. „ by St. James's Palace. „ by the Haymarket. Piccadilly, by St. James's Street. „ by Burlington House. „ by Vestry Hall. 81 Pall Mall, by Piccadilly Circus. „ by the Haymarket. Piccadilly Circus (2 Refuges). Regent Street, by Oxford Circus. „ „ by Argyll Place. „ „ by Conduit Street. „ „ by New Burlington Street. „ „ by Heddon Street. „ „ by Glasshouse Street. „ „ by Air Street. „ „ by the County Fire Office (2 Refuges). „ „ by Shaftesbury Avenue. „ „ by Jermyn Street. „ „ by Charles Street. St. James's Street, by No. 1. „ „ by King Street. Shaftesbury Avenue, by Wardour Street. „ „ by Rupert Street. „ „ by Great Windmill Street. „ „ by Piccadilly Restaurant. „ „ by Piccadilly Circus (2 large and 2 small Refuges). Waterloo Place (two). CONSTRUCTION OF VAULTS. The following regulations have been made in regard to the construction of vaults under footways:— 1. That plans and sections of proposed vaults be submitted and deposited with the Vestry. 2. That no deviation of such plan as sanctioned be made during the execution of the work without the consent of the Vestry. 3. That all walls and arches be at least one brick, or nine inches thick. 4. That the space from the upper surface of the pavement to the outside of the vault be in no case less than three feet. F 82 5. That no vault be allowed to project beyond the outside line of kerb where the footway is ten feet or more in width, and in no case shall the outside of the brickwork be carried nearer than three feet six inches to the centre line of the carriageway. SANITARY. It will be seen on reference to the report of the Medical Officer of Health, commencing on page 211, and the appendices thereto, that continuous attention has been paid to the abatement and removal of nuisances. It is impossible, however, to convey any accurate idea of the extent or value of sanitary work by the mere tabulation of figures. The most satisfactory proof of the value of this department of the Vestry's work is afforded by the reduction in the rate of mortality in the Parish since the creation of a sanitary department some thirty-six years since. Without here entering further into details, it may be remarked that the Medical Officer of Health reports that the death-rate of the parish was 19.73 per 1,000 for the year 1891, as compared with a rate of 21.1 for the whole Metropolis. The cases of fever were again unusually numerous during the year, but were chiefly infantile in character, and marked by a very low rate of mortality Thus, 66 cases of scarlet fever, 18 of enteric or typhoid fever, 16 of diphtheria, 14 of erysipelas, and 3 of membranous croup, came under the knowledge of the sanitary officers, but only 7 deaths were attributable to these diseases. Two officers have been constantly engaged in the work of inspection with a view to detecting and removing nuisances, but the Vestry are still more anxious to prevent unsanitary conditions which give rise to nuisances. 83 With this object they once more appeal to the parishioners for intelligent co-operation, especially to such as by their avocations are brought into contact with residents in the poorer and more crowded districts. The Vestry will be glad at all times to receive early information of any nuisance or supposed nuisance. It is not absolutely necessary that the name and address of the informant should be given in all cases, although it is very desirable that this should be done where possible, in order to save loss of time in fruitless inquiry. Another and most valuable mode of assisting and maintaining a high degree of public health is for each householder to insist upon scrupulous cleanliness being observed in the premises under his control. It cannot be too strongly urged that proper precautions against infection will also do much to insure immunity from sickness generally. The great preventive of disease is cleanliness—cleanliness in living, cleanliness of person, and cleanliness of surroundings. The Vestry, as the local Sanitary Authority, are constantly striving after this condition of things, but unless the parishioners generally heartily co-operate in their several spheres, a great part of the work of the Vestry will be rendered nugatory. DUST REMOVAL. In consequence of the varying requirements of the occupiers of property even in the same street, the Vestry have not found it either practicable or desirable to arrange for a house-to-house visit of the dustmen in particular streets on specified days. The contractors are required to F 2 84 send their men into every street in the Parish on every week-day, and to remove the refuse from such of the premises as the men may be called to. In the event of any difficulty being experienced in obtaining the removal of refuse, a postcard addressed to the Vestry Clerk will ensure a prompt removal. The removal of house refuse would be greatly facilitated by the general adoption of portable dust receptacles. These should not on any account be placed in the street, but kept within the householder's premises in some convenient place readily accessible to the dustmen. They should not be too large to admit of being taken up by a man unaided. The refuse would thus be removed bodily and speedily, avoiding the dirt and unpleasantness inseparable from the system of transferring the contents of a dustbin to a basket for removal. Portable receptacles may be purchased of any ironmonger for a few shillings. CONSTANT SYSTEM OF WATER SUPPLY, Owing to the extension last summer of the area supplied by the Grand Junction Waterworks Company, under the constant system, and a contemplated similar extension of area by the New River Company, the whole of the Parish will shortly be supplied with a constant service of water. SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND COWSHEDS. The last remaining slaughter house in the Parish became disused in the course of the year, and there is therefore now neither slaughter house nor cowshed in the Parish. 85 INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFICATION. During the year ended at Lady-day, 120 parishioners were notified to the Medical Officer of Health as suffering from infectious disease, viz. :— Small-Pox 1 Cholera 0 Diphtheria 20 Membraneous Croup 2 Erysipelas 14 Scarlet Fever 70 Typhus Fever 0 Typhoid Fever 13 Relapsing Fever 0 Continued Fever 0 Puerperal Fever 0 Total 120 The Vestry endorsed the opinion expressed by the Chelsea Vestry that erysipelas, except idiopathic or infectious cases, might be removed from the list of diseases required to be notified to the local sanitary authority, and communicated with the Local Government Board and Metropolitan Asylums Board to that effect. In due course a reply was received from the Asylums Board to the effect that they had asked the Local Government Board to consider whether the retention of erysipelas as a notifiable disease serves any purpose sufficiently useful to justify the large cost involved thereby. There the matter rests for the present. The Vestry have also had under consideration a suggestion by the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, that steps should be taken to include Measles 86 among the diseases to be notified to the local sanitary authority. They, however, fail to see any sufficient reason for the notification of Measles and have therefore taken no> action in the matter. THE EPIDEMIC OF INFLUENZA. The Vestry received from the Local Government Board, early in January, a provisional memorandum upon precautions advisable at times when Epidemic Influenza threatens or is prevalent, and although the epidemic, which in the winter spread so rapidly and with such painfully sudden fatal results, appears to have passed away, the Vestry deem it prudent to reproduce the purport of the memorandum in view of a possible re-appearance of the epidemic at a later period. After pointing out that knowledge of the natural history of influenza and especially of the circumstances of time and place under which it spreads, remains most imperfect, the Board remark that definite knowledge has been obtained which seems to show (1) that influenza is spread by infection from person to person, and that it does not, in any marked degree, or for any considerable length of time' confer immunity against another attack ; and (2) that the liability to contract influenza, and the danger of an attack, if contracted, are increased by depressing conditions such as exposure to cold, or to fatigue, whether mental or physical. The Board remark that, owing to its brief incubation period and the absence of any definite and easily recognisable feature, such as a rash, in its earlier stages, it is not practicable to devise any restrictive measures of universal 87 application for preventing the spread of influenza, but that some such measures should be resorted to, under some circumstances and for certain classes of persons such as— (a) For persons in whom an attack of influenza would be specially dangerous by reason of age or infirmity. (b) For the inmates of institutions, the mode of life in which can be regulated and controlled. (f) For the first cases of influenza in a locality or a household when these are early recognised. As regards such cases, the Foard make the following suggestions :— 1. Separation between the sick and the healthy should, as far as practicable, be carried out. Measures to this end have, in some instances, been adopted with marked success. 2. With isolation, should be combined disinfection of infected articles and rooms. 3. Persons suffering from influenza should not expose themselves in public places. 4. Since the propagation of influenza is known to be promoted by the assemblage of large numbers of persons in a confined atmosphere, it is advisable that when an epidemic threatens or is present, unnecessary assemblages should be studiously avoided. 5. The ventilation and cleanly keeping of any building in which many people are necessarily collected together, should receive special attention when influenza threatens or is present, with a view to secure that the air of the building shall be frequently changed, at any rate, during the intervals of its occupation, and to avoid accumulation of dust and dirt. 88 Upon the second point, the increased liability to contract the complaint and the additional danger of an attack arising from depressing conditions, the Board remark as follows:— There is reason to believe that the development of an attack of influenza in a person exposed to the infection, depends very largely upon the receptivity of the individual; and that the power of resistance varies not only in different persons, but also in the same person from time to time, being diminished by any conditions which depress the general bodily vigour. It is, therefore, important that at the time of an epidemic all persons should, as far as they are able, pay attention to such measures as tend to the maintenance of their health, wearing clothes of suitable warmth, and avoiding unnecessary exposure to cold, and fatigue, unwholesome food, and excessive use of alcoholic liquors. Similar principles should be borne in mind by those who, as managers of institutions land establishments, have to make regulations for others. There is also a very general agreement among medical practitioners tnat the risk of a relapse and of the occurrence of these pulmonary complications which constitute a chief danger of the disease is increased by anything which involves exposure to cold or fatigue before complete recovery. Persons, therefore, who are attacked by this malady should not attempt to fight against it, but should at once seek rest, warmth, and medical treatment. The nature of such treatment does not fall within the scope of this Memorandum. SMALL POX. In the month of June a letter was received from the Local Government Board, stating that isolated cases of small-pox were occurring in different parts of London, and suggesting that, in view of the very great importance of the most energetic measures being taken to prevent the spread of infection, the Medical Officer of Health should be instructed to immediately visit every house in which a case 89 of small-pox had occurred to his knowledge, and at the earliest possible moment take such measures as may be necessary to secure the isolation of the patient, the vaccinations of any persons who may have been exposed to infection, the disinfection of the premises, and any further action which the circumstances will admit of for the purpose of checking the extension of the disease. Almost precisely similar instructions were given to the Medical Officer of Health and the Sanitary Officers, on the occasion of a former epidemic, and have never been repealed. The Vestry, therefore, did not deem it necessary to take any further action than to remind the Medical Officer of Health and his staff of their former instructions, and the importance of adopting prompt measures to prevent the spread of the disease beyond the narrowest possible limits. Happily, the Parish has continued to enjoy almost complete immunity from small-pox, only one case of the disease having been reported between April, 1888, and March, 1892. ST. JAMES'S DWELLINGS. This property continues to be well let, although neces sarily there is a frequent change of tenants. During the year the Vestry have been able to invest a further sum of £400 towards extending the operations of the Trust, or replacing the capital on the expiration of the leases. A copy of the Accounts of the Trust Fund will be found on pages 182 and 183. 90 REGISTERED HOUSES. No additional houses have been registered during the year under the sanitary regulations of the Vestry made under the provisions of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874. At Lady-day, 1892, thirty-live houses were on the register. Breaches of the Regulations have occurred in some instances, but have been remedied without the necessity of recourse to legal proceedings. The additional powers conferred upon the Vestry by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, have considerably diminished the importance and necessity of registering houses under the above-mentioned regulations. INSPECTION OF BAKEHOUSES. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, having transferred to the Local Sanitary Authorities the duty of inspecting retail bakehouses, the following abstract of the requirements of the law with regard to the cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding and sanitary condition of retail bakehouses is given for the information of parishioners:— 1. A bakehouse to be in conformity with the Acts relating to retail bakehouses, is subjected to the following requirements:— (a) It must be kept in a cleanly state, and free from effluvia arising from any drain, privy, or other nuisance. (b) It must not be so overcrowded while work is carried on therein as to be injurious to the health of the persons employed, and shall be ventilated in such a manner as 91 to render harmless, so far as practicable, all the gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the manufacturing process that may be injurious to health. (c) The ceilings or tops of the bakehouse and all passages and staircases must either be painted with oil, or varnished, or limewashed, or partly painted or varnished and partly limewashed. If painted or varnished, the surface must be covered with three coats of paint or varnish, and renewed once at least in every seven years, and washed with hot water and soap at least once in every six months. Limewashing is to be renewed once at least in every six months. 2. No place on the same level with the bakehouse and forming part of the same building may be used as a sleeping place, unless it is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and has an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which at least four-and-a-half feet are made to open for ventilation. 3. A bakehouse must not be in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a bakehouse. 4. No child, young person, or woman may be employed in a bakehouse contrary to the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878. Penalties are provided in the event of an infringement of the law ; bakehouses brought into use after the 31st of May, 1883, are subject to certain further requirements. The bakehouses in the Parish (33 in number) are under frequent inspection by the Sanitary Officers of the Vestry. It has not been found necessary to take proceedings against the occupiers of any premises of that description during the past year. 92 SALE OF FOODS, &c., ACTS. The following is a list of the articles purchased by the Inspector, and submitted to the Public Analyst appointed by the Vestry, during the year:— Arrowroot 3 Butter 22 Coffee 16 Milk 14 Vinegar 1 56 It was found necessary to take proceedings in only one case. In this case a summons was taken out against a firm for selling butter certified to contain 75 per cent. of foreign fat. The defence was that the purchaser was told by two shopmen before the purchase was completed that the article was sold as margarine and not butter. The purchaser denied that he heard any such statement, and declared that nothing was said to him to lead him to believe, until after the money had actually changed hands, that he was receiving anything but butter. The shopmen were called as witnesses, and the magistrate gave the defendant the benefit of the doubt, and dismissed the summons, but without allowing costs. The cost incurred by the Vestry for the year in respect of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act is as follows:— £ s. d. Allowance to Analyst 75 0 0 Purchase of Samples, &c. 0 16 0 £75 16 0 93 SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS Summonses have been taken out in the followingcases:— Adulteration 1 Commencing to take down building without notice to Vestry 1 Defacing marble partition, Piccadilly conveniences 1 Disturbing pavement without licence of Vestry 1 Obstructions in public thoroughfares 3 Premises in state to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health 3 Total 10 Fines were inflicted in six cases; a closing order was made in each of the three cases where the premises were a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health; and in one case (adulteration) the summons was dismissed, the defendant putting forward evidence that the purchaser was told of the nature of the article before the purchase was completed. The purchaser denied that he heard this alleged statement. In addition to the above-mentioned summary cases proceedings have been taken against certain persons concerned in the management of brothels. DISORDERLY HOUSES. Several prosecutions for keeping disorderly houses have been undertaken during the year on the complaints of ratepayers, and a conviction was obtained in each case. 94 In some cases, where circumstances did not appear to render legal proceedings necessary or expedient, notice was given to the responsible parties, with the effect of causing a discontinuance of the annoyance. Complaints against the owners or occupiers of certain houses were under consideration at the date of this report. DRINKING FOUNTAIN. There is but one Drinking Fountain in the Parish, that in the Churchyard wall in Piccadilly. This Fountain was erected and is maintained without cost to the Vestry. LAVATORIES AND SANITARY CONVENIENCES, PICCADILLY CIRCUS. During the twelve months ending at Lady-day, the men's closets have been used by 241,736 persons, the ladies' conveniences by 208,094, the men's lavatory by 15,995, and the ladies' lavatory by 3,033. No record is kept of the use of the urinals, for which no charge is made, but it is estimated that nearly 3,000,000 persons have made use of them during the year. The cost of maintenance exhibits a considerable increase over the figures for the previous year, but this increase arises partly from the periodical renewing of the painted work and some necessary alterations to the electric light installation, and partly from the termination of the period for a gratuitous supply of the electric light by the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company. The practice of appointing married couples as attendants did not prove so satisfactory as was anticipated, and separate appointments of the male and female attendants have accordingly been made. A statement of the receipts and working expenses of the conveniences will be found in the Accounts commencing on page 164. URINALS. The following is a list of public urinals (in addition to the Piccadilly conveniences above referred to) erected and maintained by the Vestry:— Situation. No. of Compartments. Situation. No. of Compartments. Bridle Lane 3 King's Arms Yard 3 Broad Street 9 Mason's Yard 3 Coach and Horses Yard 4 Ramilies Street 4 Cork Street Mews 3 Vine Street 7 Ham Yard 3 Wells Street 5 The cost of maintaining the Urinals during the year is as follows:— £ s. d. Water for flushing 76 13 6 Wages for cleansing 62 8 0 £139 1 6 CAB RANKS. The following is a list of the Cab Ranks in this Parish authorised by the Commissioner of Police:— 95 96 No. of Places. Broad Street 12 Great Marlborough Street 15 Haymarket 32 Piccadilly, by the Albany 11 Regent Street, opposite Vigo Street 3 St. James's Square 20 St. James's Street 30 Shaftesbury Avenue 25 Waterloo Place 3 The only rank which has a Cabmen's Shelter is that in St. James's Square. The shelter was provided and is maintained at private expense. AMBULANCE STATIONS. With the assent of the Vestry a street ambulance station available in case of accident, &c., has been established by the Hospitals Association at the cab rank in St. James's Square. Notices have also been appended to certain street lamps indicating the nearest ambulance station in the Parish or adjacent thereto. PILLAR LETTER BOXES. With the assent of the Vestry, pillar letter boxes have been erected by the Postmaster-General in the undermentioned thoroughfares:— Western District. Albany. Beak Street. Burlington Gardens. Coventry Street. Golden Square. 97 Great Marlborough Street. Little Pulteney Street. Old Burlington Street. Piccadilly, by the Egyptian Hall. Regent Street, by Hanover Street.

Duke Street, by Ryder Street. Haymarket, by Jermyn Street. Jermyn Street, by St. James's Church. Pall Mall, by the War Office. Pall Mall, by Waterloo Place. Park Place. St. James's Square, by Charles Street. FIXED POINTS. The following list of fixed points, where a constable may be found at all times, is given for the information of Parishioners:— Guards' Memorial, Waterloo Place. Oxford Circus, South side. Burlington Gardens, by the Bank. Oxford Circus, corner of Swallow passage. Piccadilly Circus, East side. Piccadilly Circus, West side. Regent Street, by Conduit Street. Regent Street, by the County Fire Office, 7 p.m. till 3 a.m. Regent Street, by Vigo Street. St. James's Street (south end). Wardour Street, by Little Pulteney Street.

There is only one Fire Brigade Station in the Parish, viz., in Great Marlborough Street, but other stations in adjoining Parishes are available in case of an outbreak of fire. Fire alarms in electric communication with Fire Brigade Stations have been fixed and are maintained by the London County Council in the undermentioned thoroughfares:— Coventry Street, by Wardour Street. Golden Square. Oxford Street, by the Pantheon. Piccadilly, by St. James's Church. Pall Mall, by Marlborough House. Regent Street, by Conduit Street. St. James's Square. Fire escapes with attendants are nightly stationed in Golden Square and next the Parish Church, Piccadilly, and at the Fire Engine Station in Great Marlborough Street. Arrangements are also made for an escape to attend all fires during the day time. MUSIC AND DANCING LICENCES. In accordance with the Standing Orders of the London County Council, notices were given to the Vestry in the month of August, by intending applicants for Music and Dancing Licences, as follows:— Adams, Samuel, The Trocadero, 7 and 8, Great Windwill Street, for Music. Arnold, William, Willis's Rooms, 26, King Street, St. James's, for Music and Dancing. Bratt. Edwin, 6, Swallow Street, for Music only. 99 Ellis. Joshua.

Monico, James and Battista, Cafe Monico, 46, Regent Street, and 19, Shaftesbury Avenue, for Music and Dancing. Thomas, Edwin, The London Pavilion Music Hall, Piccadilly, for Music and Dancing. A licence was granted in each case. BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. Among the Bills that have received attention during the year are the following:— Session 1891. County Councils (Elections). Elementary Education. Fire Inquests. General Paving (Metropolis) Act 1817 Amendment. London County Council (Money). London County Council (Water Supply). Public Health (London) Law Amendment. Public Health (London) Law Consolidation. School Board for London Elections. Theatres (London). Session 1892. Baker Street and Waterloo Railway. Burials. Central London Railway. Coroners Act (1887) Amendment. Employers' Liability. Fire Inquests. G 2 100 Guardians of the Poor (Qualification). Guardians of the Poor (Qualification) No. 2. Local Authorities (Purchase of Land). National Telephone Company. New Telephone Company. Occupying Tenants' Enfranchisement. Outdoor Provident Relief. Plumbers' Registration. Registration Acts (Lodgers) Amendment. Sale of Intoxicating Liquors on Sundays. Shop Hours. Teachers' Regulations. The Vestry have taken action with regard to certain of these Bills, as follows:— Petitioned in favour of the Burials Bill, which, subject to existing rights, proposes to abolish payment of ecclesiastical fees for which no services are rendered, and the General Paving (Metropolis) Act (1817) Amendment Bill, which would enable local authorities to prohibit lands or houses being used for shows, &c., causing any obstruction or annoyance, and expressed approval of the principle of the Fire Inquests Bill, which proposes to authorise the holding of inquests when a fire has occurred although not attended by loss of life. Petitioned against the National Telephone Company's Bill, and the Telephone Company's Bill, both of which would confer upon the. companies concerned certain statutory rights to place and maintain telephone posts and wires on and over public and private property, and opposed in other ways the Employers' Liability Bill, which would throw upon employers liability for injury caused by their servants, even when acting outside the scope of their duty; the Guardians of the Poor 101 (Qualification) Bills, which would abolish the existing rating qualification for the office of Guardian; the 48th clause of the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1892, by which the Council seek an uncontrolled power to expend an unlimited sum of money in continuing to conduct enquiries and negotiations relating to the supply of water to London and neighbouring counties, companies having a right of such supply, and the undertakings of any of such companies; and the Registration Acts (Lodgers) Amendment Bill, which would throw upon the Overseers the responsibility of placing the names of all qualified lodgers on the Lists of Parliamentary Voters, and thereby considerably increase the difficulty and expense of preparing such lists. In addition to petitioning against the two Bills promoted by the Telephone Companies, the Vestry appointed representatives to attend a preliminary meeting called by the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, to consider as to concerted action being taken by the various local authorities with respect to the Bills, and later appointed a member to act upon a committee of local authorities, as suggested at such preliminary meeting, for the purpose of watching and protecting the interests of the local authorities as affected by the Bills. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. The passing of this Act, which came into operation on the 1st January last, will mark a new era in sanitary administration in London. It largely increases the responsibility and powers of the Vestry, and authorises the County Council to act if the Local Sanitary Authority make default. 102 The Act is principally a measure to codify the present law, but contains some amendments of considerable importance. The powers of the Vestry are extended by the Act to factories, workshops, and workplaces which are not subject to the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, relating to cleanliness, ventilation, and overcrowding. (Secs. 2, 25, and 27.) These appear to be (1) domestic workshops, i.e., where no mechanical power is used and the only persons employed are members of the family dwellingthere, and (2) workshops where neither children (under 14 years of age) nor young persons (between 14 and 18 years of age) are employed. Nuisances specified in the Act may be dealt with summarily, i.e., a penalty may be inflicted after the service of notice of the Local Authority when the nuisance arises from the wilful act or default of the person served with notice, or when such notice is not obeyed. (Secs. 2 and 4.) The law under the old Acts required the order of a magistrate before penalties accrued. Much loss of time is thus avoided by the new law. Abatement, prohibition, and closing orders may be made as hitherto, but in addition to the penalty already referred to. (Secs. 4 and 5.) It is the duty of every officer of the Local Authority, not of the sanitary officers alone, and, subject to the regulations of the Guardians, of every relieving officer, to give information of nuisances to the Local Authority. Any person may also give information of nuisances. (Sec. 3.) In order to save trouble, the Vestry have furnished the Guardians with printed forms on which the relieving officers may notify nuisances. 103 The power of entry upon premises is made somewhat wider (Sec. 10), and power to enter by night is given where overcrowding is alleged. (Sec. 115 (6).) The Sanitary Authority may enter by any of their members or by any officers or persons authorised by them either generally or in any particular case, but any person claiming a right to enter shall, if required, produce some written document properly authenticated by the Sanitary Authority. (Sec. 115.) The power conferred upon Sanitary Authorities by Secs. 108 and 115 of the Public Health Act, 1875, to take proceedings in the case of nuisances from some cause outside their district, or from offensive trades carried on outside, but causing a nuisance within, their district, is slightly extended. (Sec. 14.) Sanitary Authorities shall make bye-laws for the following purposes (a) For the prevention of nuisances arising from any snow, ice, salt, dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth, or other matter or thing in any street; and (b) For preventing nuisances arising from any offensive matter running out of any manufactory, brewery, slaughter-house, knacker's yard, butcher's or fishmonger's shop, or dunghill, into any uncovered place, whether or not surrounded by a wall or fence; and (c) For the prevention of the keeping of animals on any premises in such place or manner as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health; and 104 (d) As to the paving of yards and open spaces in connection with dwelling-houses. The County Council shall make bye-laws:— (a) For prescribing the times for the removal or carriage by road or water of any fœcal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid in or through London, and providing that the carriage or vessel used therefor shall be properly constructed and covered so as to prevent the escape of any such matter or liquid, and as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom; and (b) As to the closing and filling up of cesspools and privies, and as to the removal and disposal of refuse, and as to the duties of the occupier of any premises in connection with house refuse, so as to facilitate the removal of it by the scavengers of the Sanitary Authority. And it is the duty of the Sanitary Authority to enforce and observe the bye-laws when made. (Sec. 16.) Scattered through the Act are powers to make bye-laws for other purposes:— By the County Council— (a) For regulating offensive trades. (Sec. 19.) (b) When authorised by the Local Government Board for registering with the Council persons carrying on the trade of dairyman; inspecting cattle, and regulating the lighting ventilation, cleansing, 105 drainage, and water supply of drains; securing the cleanliness of milk vessels; and prescribing precautions to be taken for protecting milk against infection or contamination. (Sec. 28.) (c) With respect to water-closets, earth closets, privies, ashpits, cesspools, and receptacles for dung. (Sec. 39.) By the Sanitary Authority:— (a) With respect to the keeping of water-closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action. (Sec. 39.) » (b) As to the decent conduct of oersons using any public lavatories, ashpits, or sanitary conveniences (in addition to regulations with respect to the management thereof). (Sec. 45.) (c) For securing the cleanliness and freedom from pollution of tanks, cisterns, and other receptacles for storing water for domestic or drinking purposes. (Sec. 50.) (d) For removing to hospital, and keeping in hospital as long as necessary, any persons infected with a dangerous infectious disease, who are brought within their district by any vessel. (Sec. 66.) (e) With respect to the management and charges for the use of the mortuary. (Sec. 88.) (f) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than 106 one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied; for the registration of houses so let or occupied; for the inspection of such houses; for enforcing drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses; for the cleansing and limewashing at stated times of the premises; for the taking of precautions in case of any infectious disease. (Sec. 94.) (g) For promoting cleanliness in, and the habitable condition of tents, vans, sheds, and similar structures used for human habitation, and for preventing the spread of infectious disease by the persons inhabiting the same, and generally for the prevention of nuisances in connection with the same. (Sec. 95). Bye-laws have already been made by the Vestry for the purposes mentioned in paragragh (f) above. Advantage will probably be taken of the new Act to reconsider them and submit them in an amended form, as new bye-laws, for confirmation by the Local Government Board. Regulations already made by the Vestry for other purposes (e.g., relating to the use of public conveniences and the public mortuary) will be superseded by bye-laws made by the Vestry and submitted to the Local Government Board for confirmation. (Sec. 114, and Schedule I.) The removal of house and street refuse by a Sanitary Authority is to be classed among offensive trades, and any such authority may not create a nuisance by their method of treating or disposing of such refuse. (Sec. 22.) 107 The provisions of the Act for preventing nuisances from smoke, both in respect of buildings and steam vessels on the river (which are very similar to those hitherto in force), are to be enforced by the Sanitary Authority. (Sec. 23). The Sanitary Authority are to keep the roadways and footways within their jurisdiction properly swept and cleansed, so far as is reasonably practicable, under a penalty of £20. The law requiring the occupiers or owners of adjoining premises to cause the footways adjoining their respective premises to be swept and cleansed is repealed. (Sec. 29.) The Sanitary Authority are to secure the due removal at proper periods of house refuse, and the due cleansing out and emptying at proper periods of ashpits, earth closets, privies, and cesspools, and to give sufficient notice of the times appointed for such removal, cleansing out and emptying, and if the house refuse is not removed, or the ashpit, &c., cleansed out, at the ordinary period, the Sanitary Authority is to comply with the written notice of an occupier of any premises to remove such refuse or cleanse out and empty any ashpit, earth closet, privy, or cesspool, within 48 hours, exclusive of Sundays and public holidays under a penalty of £20. (Sec. 30.) Parishioners apparently have a remedy directly against the Sanitary Authority for non-removal of trade refuse on request and payment. (Sec. 34.) The Sanitary Authority may require the removal of any obnoxious matter within 48 hours, and if the notice is not complied with, such matter may be disposed of by the 108 Sanitary Authority. The owner will be entitled to any surplus, and liable to any expenses, resulting from the removal and sale of such matter. (Sec. 35.) The Sanitary Authority may by their own servants, or through contractors, collect and remove the manure and other refuse matter from any stables and cowhouses within their district, the occupiers of which signify their consent in writing to such removal. (Sec. 36). Power is given to the Sanitary Authority to enforce sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences for factories, workshops, and work places, and, where both sexes are employed, proper accommodation for each sex. (Sec. 38.) Public conveniences, including lavatories, may be provided by the Sanitary Authority, and for this purpose the subsoil of any road, exclusive of the footway adjoining any building, or the curtilage of a building is vested in such authority. (Sec. 44.) Persons having the use of sanitary conveniences in common are to keep the same, the fittings thereof, and approaches thereto, in clean condition; any such person who is in default is liable to a penalty, and if the particular person in default cannot be ascertained, each of the persons having the use in common is liable to a penalty. (Sec. 46.) The law in regard to unsound food is considerably strengthened, and a second conviction within twelve months may be punished by a notice of the facts being affixed to the offender's premises for any period not exceeding twentyone days. (Sec. 47.) 109 A house newly erected or rebuilt from or below the ground floor is not to be occupied as a dwelling-house until the Sanitary Authority have certified that it has a proper and sufficient supply of water either from a water company or by some other means. An occupied house without a proper and sufficient supply of water is a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under the Act. (Sec. 48.) Any water company not giving notice to the Sanitary Authority of their having cut off the water supply to any inhabited house is liable to a fine of £10, and it is the duty of the Sanitary Authority to take proceedings against any company in default. (Sec. 49.) Copies of certificates received by the Medical Officer of Health, relating to patients suffering from an infectious disease, are not only to be sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, but to the head teacher of the school attended by the patient (if a child) or by any child who is an inmate of the same house as the patient (Sec. 55.) This provision will necessitate an inquiry as to the school attended by each child in a house in which any infectious disease requiring notification makes its appearance. Every Sanitary Authority is to provide proper premises and apparatus for the destruction of such infected bedding, clothing, and other articles as may be necessary. (Sec. 59.) The Sanitary Authority are to cleanse and disinfect, without charge, any house (or part) and articles therein likely to retain infection, unless within 24 hours from the receipt of a notice of such disinfection, the master of the house elect to do such cleansing or disinfection. Articles 110 may be destroyed instead of disinfected. Temporary accommodation is to be provided, free of charge, for persons displaced while the work of cleansing and disinfection is being carried out, and compensation is to be paid for any damage to the house or contents and for the destruction of any articles. (Sec. 60.) Notice is to be given to the master of any house, or part of a house, in which infectious disease exists, that no infectious rubbish is to be thrown into the ashpit without previous disinfection, and, if requested, the Sanitary Authority are to provide for the removal and disinfection or destruction of any such rubbish. (Sec. 62.) Notice is also to be given to the master of any house, or part of a house, in which there is a person suffering from a dangerous infectious disease, that a penalty attaches to the ceasing to occupy such house, or part, without disinfection, or failure to give notice to the owner or master of the house of the existence of such disease, or to giving a false answer when questioned by the owner or master of the house, or any person negotiating for the hire of such house, or part, as to any person having within the previous six weeks suffered in such house, or part, from any such disease. (Sec. 65.) The Sanitary Authority may remove any person who is suffering from any dangerous infectious disease and is without proper lodging or accommodation, to any hospital in, or within a convenient distance of, London, subject to the consent of the managers of the hospital. (Sec. 66.) This provision will enable patients dangerous to the community to be compulsorily removed to any hospital of the Asylums Board. 111 Milking, fruit-picking, or engaging in any occupation connected with food, or carrying on any trade or business in such a manner as to spread the infection, by any person who knows himself to be suffering from a dangerous infectious disease, is prohibited. (Sec. 69.) The County Council are to provide and maintain proper accommodation for the holding of inquests, and may enter into an agreement with a Sanitary Authority for the use for such purpose of any building belonging to such authority. (Sec. 92.) In this parish inquests are invariably held either at the Vestry Hall or in the Board-room at the Union Offices. The County Council may provide one or two places for the reception of unidentified dead bodies, and retain such bodies and clothing and articles found thereon with a view to ultimate identification. A Secretary of State is to make regulations for the use of such places. (Sec. 93.) Underground rooms are not to be occupied except under certain specified conditions, which, however, may be dispensed with or modified by the Sanitary Authority either absolutely or for a limited time. Any requisite required before the passing of the Act is not to be dispensed with. An appeal lies to the Local Government Board against the decision of the Sanitary Authority upon an application for the requirements of the Act in regard to the occupation of the underground rooms to be dispensed with or modified. (Sec. 96.) The duty of reporting the unlawful occupation of underground rooms is transferred to the officers of the Sanitary Authority. (Sec 97.) 112 The Sanitary Authority may appoint a committee to serve and receive notices, take proceedings, and empower any officer of the authority to make complaints and take proceedings in their behalf, and otherwise to execute the Act (Sec. 99), and the Vestry have appointed their Sanitary Committee to carry the Act into execution under this provision. The County Council may take proceedings where it has been proved to their satisfaction that the Sanitary Authority have made default in doing their duty under the Act, and recover the expenses incurred from the authority in default. (Sec. 100.) The County Council may report to the Local Government Board the default of any Sanitary Authority in executing the Act, or enforcing any bye-law made in pursuance thereof, and if such default cannot be remedied under the other provisions of the Act, the Local Government Board may make an order limiting the time for the performance of the duty in default, and, if necessary, enforce such order by writ of mandamus, or appoint the County Council to perform such duty. (Sec. 101.) A book is to be kept in which shall be entered all complaints made of any infringement of the provisions of the Act, or of any bye-laws made thereunder, and of nuisances. All such complaints are to be forthwith investigated by a Sanitary Inspector, and his reports, together with the order of the Sanitary Authority thereon, are to be entered in a book which is to be open to the inspection of any inhabitant of the district and of any authorised officer of the County Council. (Sec. 107.) 113 A Medical Officer of Health is to be removable from office only with the consent of the Local Government Board. A Sanitary Inspector appointed after 1st January, 1895, is to hold a certificate of competency from such body as the Local Government Board may approve, or to have been for three consecutive years preceding 1895 a sanitary inspector or inspector of nuisances in London or an urban sanitary district out of London, containing not less than 20,000 inhabitants. (Sec. 108.) Notices may be signed by the Clerk to the Sanitary Authority or other officer, but orders are to be given under the common seal of the authority. (Sec. 127.) The foregoing observations are not to be taken as an" exhaustive digest of even such of the provisions of the Act as are specially referred to, still less of the Act itself. The existing law has only been reproduced in these remarks where its omission would have tended to obscurity (e.g., certain purposes for which bye-laws may be made), or where in special cases (e.g., certain of the provisions relating to infectious diseases) it seems desirable to notice recent amendments of the law now embodied in the Act. The Act received very careful consideration by the Vestry when it was before Parliament in the form of two Bills, one for the consolidation, and the other for the amendment of the law relating to Public Health in London, and it is interesting to note that nearly all the points raised by the Sanitary and Parlimentary Bills Committee in their report of the 24th March, 1891, on the two bills,have H 114 been met by amendments incorporated in the Act. Thereis, however, one very regrettable exception: the duty of cleansing the footway is transferred from individual occupiers of premises abutting on the footway to the community, and a penalty is attached to the non-performance of the duty "so far as is reasonably practicable." The Vestry fear that it will prove impracticable to carry this part of the Act into effect with the desired efficiency, and that undeserved discredit will attach to local self government by the partial breakdown of the organisation under exceptional conditions. The most important amendments suggested by the Committee and incorporated in the Act, are (1) power to make bye-laws regulating the use of public lavatories and similar conveniences, and to make a charge for such use; (2) power to make use of the hospitals belonging to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, whether in London or not, for the compulsory removal of infectious patients without proper lodging or accommodation; (3) notifying the occurrence of infectious disease in a house to the masters of schools instead of to the school managers, and (4) the retention of the sanitary inspector as a purely local officer. In addition to the points specifically raised on the Bill, one or two other matters, which have, at various times been brought by the Vestry under the notice of the Local Government Board, have now been dealt with. Perhaps the most important of these is the power given by the Act to control the removal of offensive matter through the streets. The Vestry have prepared a code of bye-laws for such of the purposes as they are authorised by the Act to make 115 bye-laws, so far as the circumstances of the Parish appear to require, and have submitted the same to the Local Government Board in draft before formally making them. LONDON WATER SUPPLY. The Vestry deeply regret that the efforts of the Executive Committee of Vestries and District Boards, which was formed on their initiative, to vest the supply of water to London in a public authority were not attended with success. It is satisfactory, however, to notice that the Select Committee of the House of Commons, to whom the Bill promoted by the Executive Committee was referred, reported that the Bill (the Metropolis Water Supply Bill) "was promoted in the public interest, and to considerable public advantage." The following report of the Executive Committee contains all that need now be said on the subject:— 1. As their labours are now drawing to a close, the Executive Committee deem it fitting to submit to the bodies whom they represent a brief statement of what they have done, and how the matter with which they were called upon to deal now stands. They have, however, from time to time, informed the Vestries and District Boards so fully of the successive steps which have been taken that it is not necessary now to go very fully into detail. 2. The first meeting of the Committee was held on the 9th October, 1890, and altogether 30 formal meetings of the Committee and Sub-Committees have been held. In addition to these formal meetings, attendance was given at the House of Commons by certain members who were deputed to be present upon each of the 24 days during which the Bills relating to the London Water Supply were before the Select Committee, in order to instruct the Parliamentary Agents and Counsel as occasion might require. H 2 116 3. As a copy of the Bill, together with an explanatory dum, was forwarded to each Vestry and District Board, it is not necessary here to enlarge upon its provisions. It may, however, be stated that the principle of the Bill was simply to vest the supply of water within the existing Metropolitan water area in a public authority, on the basis of such authority in the first instance acquiring the undertakings of the Companies now supplying water, by agreement or on arbitration terms. The Bill was intentionally drawn in such a manner that Parliament could adapt it either to the creation of a Special Authority representative of the whole water area, or the constitution of the London County Council as the Water Authority. In providing for a directly elected authority, the Committee were not unmindful that the Bill promoted by the Corporation of the City of London proposed to create a Special Authority, to be elected by the Town and County Councils and other bodies in the water area. The question of the constitution of the Water Authority was thus presented to Parliament in the widest possible manner. 4. The Committee kept the City Corporation and the London County Council, through their special committees and officers, informed of each successive stage of their proceedings, and with a view to diffusing information more widely as to the objects of the Bill, held an open meeting at the County Hall, Spring Gardens (kindly lent for the occasion by the County Council), after the introduction of the Bill into Parliament. The Committee were under the impression that both the City Corporation (who were likewise promoting a Bill) and the London County Council (who, on the 30th September, 1890, had authorised their Special Committee on Water Supply to " enter into tentative negotiations with the Water Companies for the purpose of ascertaining upon what terms the Companies will be prepared to dispose of their undertakings to the Council") earnestly desired an early settlement of the Metropolitan water question, and that the chief point of difference between them would be as to the constitution of the Water Authority. It was therefore a source of extreme regret, not unmingled with surprise, that 117 at a very early stage of the inquiry by the Select Committee of the House of Commons, the City joined with the County Council, not for the purpose of amending, but of destroying the Bill. The attitude of the City was especially surprising, as the heads of agreement which they entered into with the County Council recognised the latter as supreme and independent on all questions of principle in regard to the supply of water to the whole Metropolitan area. 5. The line taken by the County Council was merely a plea for delay, and the different reasons assigned by the Council's witnesses in support of this plea were much at variance. Thus, Sir T. H. Farrer, vice-Chairman, pleaded for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire whether the present sources of supply of water are adequate in quantity and quality to the growing needs of the population (questions 2,983 and 2,985), although he subsequently stated (question 3,460) that he should wish to acquire the Water Companies' undertakings at their fair value, and it would be only in the event of more than a fair value being demanded, that he would wish to bring into exercise the power to compete with the Companies. Mr. Binnie, the Council's Engineer, urged that it was undesirable to compel the Water Authority to acquire the existing undertakings, until further inquiry had been made as to the future source of supply, although he admitted (question 4,554) that he was not aware of any case where a public authority had been authorised by Parliament; to establish competing works with an existing statutory Company, and (question 4,555) that such a course would not only be without precedent, but would be a suicidal kind of thing to do. The evidence of Mr. Charles Harrison, Chairman of the Council's Parliamentary Committee, is rather difficult to follow, but he seems to urge that the settlement of the water question must be delayed until the incidence of local taxation has been adjusted as between owner and occupier. Mr. Haggis, Deputy-Chairman, suggested that a Committee of the Council and a Royal Commission should sit concurrently but independently, the former, apparently to negotiate with the Companies (questions 5,625 and 5,626), while the latter were inquiring 118 into the necessity and source of a supplementary supply (question 5,641). Counsel for the County Council went so far as to suggest, in his closing speech, that the proposed Royal Commission should allocate the various gathering grounds in England among the different centres of population. 6. The City tendered no evidence, and the Companies were not called upon to give any. The case for the Water Companies has therefore not yet been heard, and the testimony given on behalf of the London County Council was so ambiguous and conflicting as not to advance a settlement of the question to the extent that was hoped. 7. The observations of the Select Committee from time to time induced the promoters of the Bill to anticipate a satisfactory result. Thus the Select Committee intimated very early in the proceedings that they would adopt the first paragraph of the report of Sir William Harcourt's Committee in 1880, as their starting point, viz., that it is desirable to establish a single public representative water authority for the Metropolis. Again, the Committee stated on the Bill promoted by the City, "that no Bill can be satisfactory, dealing with t-he questions referred to the Committee, which merely constitutes a public authority to promote Bills in Parliament." Again, Counsel for the Bill was told not to argue the question of competing supplies, "the difficulties of an independent supply are too obvious." And, as late as the 10th June, the Chairman intimated that the Committee leaned to the creation of a Statutory Committee, to be appointed jointly by the City Corporation and the County Council, as the water authority, subject to all questions of principle being reserved for settlement by the County Council alone. This proposal was quite in harmony with the Bill, and was accepted by the promoters, although they are still of opinion that the consumers in the districts outside the County of London, who are rapidly increasing in number, should be directly represented on the Water Authority. For reasons which are not quite apparent neither the City nor the County Council, however, would take up the Bill even when altered to meet their own suggestions so far as the constitution of the authority was 119 concerned. With regard to other objections taken to the Bill, two years were allowed by the Bill for the service of notice to treat and, if this period was considered insufficient for the inquiry suggested by the County Council, it might have been extended. The Companies would necessarily afford opportunity for the inspection of their plant, &c., or suffer the consequences of the only inference which the Arbitrators would be likely to draw from a refusal. Indeed, it was reported to the County Council on the 18th November, 1890, that three of the Companies had already given permission for the Council's Engineer to inspect their works. The financial proposals of the Bill were not shown to be unsound in any respect, indeed, if the suggested Statutory Committee had been created the water authority, the finances would have been under the control of the London County Council and subject to the rules and conditions of their ordinary expenditure. To prevent inflation of the price of the undertakings, certain instructions to the Arbitrators were inserted in the Bill, and, if necessary for the protection of the purchasers, others might have been added. Hence the Bill either met, or could easily have been made to meet, all reasonable requirements of the County Council. 8. The Select Committee in their report recommend that the London County Council, if constituted the water authority, should be required to purchase the undertakings of the eight Water Companies by agreement, or failing agreement, by arbitration within a fixed period. Acquisition of these undertakings within a fixed period was a cardinal principle of the Bill, and the Executive Committee have therefore little doubt that if the Corporation of the City of London had cared to take up the Bill, subject to modifications which the promoters would have felt no difficulty in accepting, or if the London County Council had been willing to adopt the suggestions thrown out by the Select Committee, the supply of water to London would have been vested in a public authority by an Act of the past session. As the matter, stands, the Companies will probably claim, when the next attempt at a settlement is made, a right to the unearned 120 increment arising from the increased valuation of property in the Metropolis which came into effect this year, the capital value of which can scarcely be computed at less than, one million sterling. The Executive Committee feel that they, and their advisers, took every possible step to bring about a satisfactory solution of the question, and regret that owing to what they believe to be the mistaken view adopted by their opponents, who are also public authorities, further delay and expense must be incurred before the desired end is attained. For this delay and expense, as well as for any increased compensation due to delay, the Corporation and the County Council must be held responsible. The Vestry have recently received communications from one or two local authorities on the south side of the river, complaining of the bad quality of the water supplied in their districts. It was a matter of some suprise to the Vestry that the local authorities south of the Thames assisted to so small an extent in the promotion of the above-mentioned Bill, for any advantages to be gained by the consolidation of the Water Companies' undertakings, would have been shared in to a greater extent by consumers south of the river, where the scale of charges is so much higher than in the remainder of the Metropolis. As the matter at present stands, the Vestry do not see how they can usefully co-operate with these tardily complaining authorities, although they are still of opinion that the municipalisation of the Metropolitan water supply on the lines of the Metropolis Water Supply Bill of last year would be advantageous to the community. PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. Session 1891.— The Central London Railway Bill became law in the course of the Session. 121 Session 1892.— The only scheme of the present Session affecting this Parish is the proposed Waterloo and Baker Street Railway. The deposited plan shows that the contemplated railway would enter the Parish at the south end of the Haymarket, and pass along the centre of the Haymarket, across Piccadilly, and along the centre of Tichborne Street and Regent Street, at a depth of about 50 feet below the surface of the street. A station would be constructed at the northern end of the Haymarket and another at Oxford Street Circus. The railway would be worked by electricity in a separate up and down tube, and would be confined to passenger and parcels traffic. The Vestry opposed the Bill in its earliest stages, with a view to obtain the insertion of additional clauses and certain amendments in points of detail. Negotiations ensued with the promoters, and there is every reason to believe that all necessary safeguards for the interests of the parishioners will be obtained. The Bill had not been read a second time at Lady-day, and such of the Bills of the present Session for projected railways in London as pass second reading, are to be referred to a joint Committee of Lords and Commons. OVERHEAD WIRES. The Vestry have on several occasions within the last ten years urged upon the Government the necessity of legislative control over the erection and maintenance of overhead wires in London. The risk of danger was increasing each year, with the age of the wires and their supports, the large annual addition to the mileage of wires, and with what is. 122 believed to be the increasing number of abandoned wires. It was therefore with some degree of satisfaction that the Vestry regarded the passing of the London Overhead Wires Act, 1891, by which the London County Council were authorised to make bye-laws and the several local authorities were empowered to enforce the same. Late in December the Vestry received a draft code of bye-laws made by the Council under the Act referred to, with an intimation that representations relating to the same were to be made to the Board of Trade not later than the 22nd January (subsequently extended at the request of the Vestry until the 22nd February). The Vestry carefully considered the proposed bye-laws and approved generally of their provisions, subject to a few suggested amendments, the most important of which were directed to prohibiting the attachment of wires to chimneys or other parts of buildings under any circumstances and to the efficient protection of iron or steel wires and supports from oxydation or rust. METROPOLITAN BUILDING ACTS. Early in the autumn the Vestry had before them a letter from the President of the Local Government Board, enclosing a print of a draft Bill for consolidating the law relating to the construction and use of buildings in London, and requesting to be furnished with the observations of the Vestry thereon. The existing law is almost entirely administered by the London County Council and District Surveyors appointed by them, and comes only incidentally under the notice of the local authority. It appeared to the Vestry that 123 tunity should be taken of the occasion offered by the consolidation of the law to obtain any necessary amendments. They therefore asked Professor Kerr, the District Surveyor for St. James's, to favour them with a statement of any amendments in the Building Acts which his long experience might suggest, in order that the same might be considered in conjunction with the draft Bill. Professor Kerr was good enough to submit an able and carefully prepared statement containing some valuable suggestions. A copy of this statement was sent to the President of the Local Government Board, with a communication based upon a report of the Parliamentary Bills Committee of the Vestry, of which the following is an abstract:— That the President of the Local Government Board be informed, in reply to his letter on the subject, that the draft Bill for consolidating' the enactments relating to the construction and use of buildings in London appears to accurately reproduce the existing law, that the consolidation of the existing law will prove advantageous, that the vestry trust that advantage will be taken of the opportunity to introduce any necessary amendments in the law, and that with this object in view they have taken counsel with the District Surveyor on the subject, and submit for the consideration of the President that the law relating to the construction and use of buildings in London should be amended in the following respects:— 1. That the officers responsible for administering the law relating to the construction and use of buildigs in London should be the Surveyors appointed by the local authorities, instead of District Surveyors appointed by the London County Council. 2. That the Yestry agree with the views expressed by the District Surveyor (a copy of whose remarks will be forwarded to the President) in the following suggestions:— (a) That all structural ironwork should be brought under official control, both as regards design and strength, and also as regards workmanship. 124 (5) That the term "warehouse" should be better defined so as to draw proper distinction as regards limitation of size, &c., between Warehouses, as generally so understood (e.g., Warehouses at the Docks), and Business Premises, such as drapery establishments in Regent Street, which come within the present definition. (c) That party walls should be subject to the rules relating to party walls to their entire height, notwithstanding they are carried above the height of an adjoining building. (d) That as regards dangerous structures, the law should be amended so as to prevent freeholders obtaining a new building at the cost of a lessee, with a few years only of a lease to run. The Yestry are of opinion that this might be effected by extending the principle of the Housing of the Working Classes Act to all buildings, so that in cases where dangerous buildings are demolished and rebuilt, the cost thereof should be borne by the freeholder without adversely affecting minor interests, if the unexpired term of the lease is less than (say) twenty-one years. 3. That with regard to other suggestions of the District Surveyor :— (a) The Vestry do do not see any necessity for defining "fire-proof floors," as any definition might possibly prevent the introduction of improved methods of construction or new materials from time to time. (b) The Yestry do not see any need for defining pipes at "low pressure." (c) The Vestry are of opinion that the summary jurisdiction of a police court, constituting the Magistrate the arbiter upon evidence given before him, is preferable to a tribunal formed of experts. 125 (d) That it should be the statutory duty of the District Surveyor, as a local officer responsible for the safety of buildings in his district, to report or initiate action in the case of dangerous structures. The thanks of the Vestry were unanimously voted to Professor Kerr for the assistance he had rendered them in the matter. About the middle of November, a letter was received from the Vestry of Kensington, asking the Vestry to appoint representatives to attend a conference to consider the provisions of the draft Bill above referred to, and the amendments required in the existing law. The conference was to be held on the 2nd December, a day after the date on which the President had requested replies to be sent to his letter. The subject had already been maturely considered by a Committee of the Vestry, and, apart from the lateness of the date fixed for the conference, appeared to be one which could be better dealt with by local boards individually, viewed as it then would be according to divergent local requirements, than at an aggregate meeting of representatives. For these reasons, the Vestry decided not to take any part in the Conference. PROPOSED DISTRICT COUNCILS. A letter from the London Municipal Reform League setting forth a suggested scheme for the establishment of District Councils in London, and presenting some features to which the Vestry entertained an objection, induced the 126 Vestry to appoint a special Committee to consider th subject. The following report was presented to the Vestry, and adopted, on the 12th November:— Your Committee have to report that as regards the administration of local affairs in St. James's, there appears to be no pressing need of amending legislation. As. however, legislation is apparently imminent owing to the diversity of practice in many parts of the Metropolis, advantage might be taken of the opportunity to endeavou to more completely consolidate the administration of municipal business in this as well as other Parishes, and your Committee therefore submit for the consideration of the Vestry the following scheme which they have prepared. In submitting this scheme your Committee desire to most strongly affirm their deliberate and mature opinion that the autonomy of the Parish should not be interfered with. Apart from historical associations, the parishioners at present take an active and intelligent interest in local questions, the various branches of administration, sanitary,, and otherwise, have been devised and are well adapted to the peculiar circumstances of the locality, and your Committee are convinced that any change in the area of municipal administration would be attended by an increased expenditure and a diminished interest in local concerns. The Parish of St. James's, it may be remarked, is both as regards population and rateable value, the most important in the Borough of Strand, and is recognised as such by the Public Statutes belonging to the Borough being placed in the custody of the Vestry Clerk. It will be observed that as regards this Parish the principal alterations in local government, if the scheme becomes law, would be as follows : — 1. The Vestry, Churchwardens, and Overseers would be superseded by a District Council. 2. The District Council, in addition to all the duties now performed by the Yestry would be responsible for the preparation of the 127 Voters' and Jury Lists, the registration of births and deaths,., public vaccination, and the administration, through a Committee, of the Public Baths and Washhouses. 3. All matters relating to public health would be centred in the District Council, instead of as now, being divided between the Vestry and the Poor Law G-uardians. 4. The Public Baths and Washhouses would be administered by a Committee of the District Council. 5. The Assessment Committee would be appointed jointly by the District Council and the London County Council. 6. Procedure would follow generally the lines of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, and be in agreement with the practice in corporate towns. The following is the scheme submitted by your Committee 1. Area.—It is desirable that no course should be adopted which would cause any needless interruption to local municipal life. It is therefore suggested that the area of jurisdiction should be that of Parishes in Schedule A, and of Districts in Schedule B of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, as amended by the Acts transferring the Parishes of Battersea, Fulham, Hammersmith, and St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, from Schedule B to Schedule A of the first mentioned Act. If, however, some of these areas should be deemed too small, the Parliamentary Borough might be taken as the area, but in no case should any existing area under the Local Management Act be divided, except where a portion of a Parish is wholly detached. 2. Councillors to possess the same qualifications as members of the County Council, i.e., they must be qualified to elect to the office of Councillor. The minimum number of Councillors for any district to be 24, and the maximum 60. To be disqualified by bankruptcy, accepting office of profit, or being interested in any contract with the Council. 128 3. Electors to be County Electors, i.e., persons entitled to vote in the Election of County Councils. 4. Date of Election.—Some day in the first two weeks in April to be appointed by the Local Government Board. All the District Councils throughout London to be elected on the same day. 5. Period of Office.—Three years, and all Councillors to retire simultaneously. 6. Chairman.—To be elected by the District Council to serve for one year only, but eligible for re-election, to stand in the same position as Mayor of a Municipal Corporation, but without the title. To be Returning Officer at Elections of District Councillors, County Councillors, and Members of Parliament (sees. 53, 61 and 244 of Municipal Corporations Act, 1882). Council to appoint deputy in absence or illness of Chairman. .7. Duties of Council.—All local duties, except the administration of poor law relief, including : — Paving Lighting Cleansing Sewerage and Drainage Sanitary Now performed by Vestries and District Boards. Assessing Property Rate making and Collecting (for all purposes whatever) Registration of voters Preparation of Jury List Now performed by Overseers. Registration of Births and Deaths Vaccination Now performed by Guardians of the Poor. 129 Public Baths and houses Public Libraries Now performed by Commissioners, &c., appointed by Vestries. Burials Administration of Charities, vested in any Vestry or other parochial body not exclusively ecclesiastical. 8. Assessment Committees.—These are now appointed in some Parishes by the Vestry, and in others those in Union) by the Guardians of the Poor. Uniformity of practice is desirable. It is therefore suggested that the Assessment Committee should be appointed jointly by the District and County Councils. This would secure the benefit of local knowledge combined with uniformity of principle in assessment and would prevent a repetition of the recent unseemly difference of opinion between the County Council and Local Authorities regarding the assessment of property in certain localities. 9. Audit.—Two Auditors to be elected by the County Electors at the same time as the District Councillors, and one to be appointed by the Chairman of the District Council (Sec. 25 of Municipal Corporations Act, 1882). 110. Rate.—All precepts, whether from central bodies, like the County Council, or local bodies, like the G-uardians of the Poor, to be addressed to the District Council, and one Rate only, to be called the District Rate, to be levied in each District, except where any portion of a district is subject to a special charge in respect of any mortgage or other liability now existing, in which case a special rate would in addition be levied in the locality subject to the charge. The proportions levied for the several Metropolitan and district charges respectively to be distinctly specified in every demand note served upon the ratepayers. 11. Properties, Debts, and Liabilities.—Properties of localities and debts and liabilities now secured on any part of a district to continue to be the property or liability of such district I 130 only. Power to be given to sell local property to the District Council, and to sell superfluous property and apply proceeds to redemption of local debt. 12. Officers.—Sections 17 to 21 of the Municipal Corporations Act 1882, to be adapted. Existing claims to superannuation allowances to be safeguarded. Provision to be made for compensation for loss of office, payment of such compensation to be in suspense so long as any officer entitled to the same holds any municipal appointment obtained subsequently to the granting of such compensation. All officers holding a municipal appointment to contribute towards a county or national self-supporting superannuation fund. 13. Churchwardens and Overseers.—Churchwardens to be appointed by members of congregations and to be relieved of all except strictly ecclesiastical work. Overseers of the Poor to cease to be appointed. 14. Generally.—The provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, to be adopted so far as possible, with any necessary alterations, to regulate procedure. 15. Miscellaneous.—The District Council to be a body corporate with perpetual succession and common seal, enabled to hold land without licence in mortmain, with power to acquire compulsorily property for all the purposes of the Act (including stables, wharves, depots, baths, libraries, etc.) by means of provisional Orders (see Sees. 175 to 181, of the Public Health Act, 1875), power to appoint Committees, and frame byelaws. Copies of the Report were sent to the Local Government Board, the Vestries and District Boards of London, and persons actively interested in the subject of London local government, including the Hon. Secretary of the Municipal Reform League. The last mentioned gentleman (Mr. J. F. 131 Torr) made certain comments on the report, and the Vestry's remarks thereon are summarised in the followingabstract of a report of the Parliamentary Bills Committee :— (1) That the Vestry do not consider it desirable or necessary to authorise the London County Council to alter the areas of local jurisdiction ; or (2) to arbitrate between District Councils, or to command the performance of duties by the local body, the desire of the Vestry being to create a healthy local opinion ; or (3) to delegate any power to the local body, which should be established for purely local functions defined by statute. (4) That the Vestry's scheme does not propose to interfere with the City of London, which might, however, be constituted a district for a District Council. (5) That the mere question of number of members of the District Council is not material. (6) That the District Council would have all the powers to establish libraries, &c., now possessed by Commissioners, and to establish gymnasia, possessed by the Commissioners for Public Baths. (7) That the provision of mortuaries and Coroner's Court Houses is dealt with by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. (8) That the School Board and Asylums Board are not local bodies and their work does not come within the scope of the Vestry's scheme. (9) That although representation of the District Councils on the County Council is not provided for by the scheme, the Vestry are not unmindful that some such plan would be extremely useful in welding together County and Local administration, and (10) That the Vestry's scheme is an outline only, and is not intended to be complete in all its details. SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON. The continuous growth in the expenditure of the School Board, out of all proportion to the increase in its work, has naturally attracted the attention of the Vestry in common with other local rating authorities during the year. In view of the approaching election, the Vestry circulated, among the parishioners, early in the year, a statement in which the expenditure of the Board was critically I 2 132 examined. The figures, which were taken from the Board's Accounts and other official sources, showed that the expenditure was increasing under every head, and that the net cost per child for school maintenance had increased from £1 17s. Id. in the two years ended Ladyday, 1887 and 1888 respectively, to £2 5s. l½d. in the year ended Lady-day, 1891, more than £1 2s. per head above the average in English Board Schools outside London. Instances were also given of what appears to be excessive and unnecessarily expensive staffing of schools, and attention was called to an increase of about 50 per cent., within two years, of the "Salaries of Inspectors, Instructors, and •other officers and miscellaneous expenditure," much of which is unproductive from an educational point of view. Unsatisfactory as this state of affairs was, the estimates for the year ending Lady-day, 1892, revealed an even worse condition, and called forth a special report from the Vestry's Finance Committee. A copy of this report was also sent to each ratepayer, and to every local rating authority in London, in the hope that care would be taken to select and support such candidates only at the then approaching election as would make a radical alteration in the expenditure of the Board. The report is of more than passing interest, and is therefore reproduced as follows :— The present School Board for London is now completing its third and last year of office. Its expenditure has been characterised by an enormous and continuous increase. On the other hand the number of scholars in the Day Schools shows a smaller increase than has occurred during the period of any previous Board. The increase of expenditure has taken place under every head, as the following comparative statement of the estimates for the last year of the Board elected in 1885 and the last year of the Board elected in 1888, will show :— 133  Estimate for year ended 25th March, 1889.

After the adjustment of commencing balances (a surplus of £66,417 11s. 8d. at Lady-day, 1888, and a defificiency of £9,196 at Lady-day, 1891), the amounts raised by precepts in each of these two periods were respectively £1,028,883 16s. 2d., and £1,483,174 2s. l0d. The average attendance in the Day Schools for the year ended Ladyday, 1889, was estimated at 354,704 (it was actually only 342,321), and the average attendance for the year ending Lady-day, 1892, is estimated at 356,451. It will tints be seen that the Ratepayers will be called upon to pay £454.290 more this year than for the year 1888-9, while the number of scholars to be educated has increased by only 14,130. Stated in other words, the charge on the Bates has increased by 44.15 per cent., while the attendance in the Schools has increased by no more than 4.12 per cent., that is to say, in the three years the expenditure has increased ten times as rapidly as the attendance of scholars. The difference in the Financial Administration between the Board elected in 1885, and its successor the expiring Board, is very marked, for whereas the former Board kept its expenditure fairly within the limits of the Estimate, the latter has each year exceeded its Estimate by a very considerable amount. 134 Examined in detail, the Estimates for the current year are even more unsatisfactory, for the greater part of the additional expenditure is lue to the increased cost of School Maintenance and Administration, over both of which the Board possesses almost complete control. The ing is a comparative statement of the cost of School Maintenance for the two periods referred to :— EXPENDITURE AND RECEIPTS.

Id.), but the cost for the current year is estimated at £2 9s. 2d. 135 The following comparative statement of the average gross cost of School Maintenance for the year ended September, 1890, is taken from the recently issued Report of the Education Department (page 39). 1890.

For the year ended the 25th March. 1889, the Inspectors. Instructors, and School Correspondents cost £16,198, but for the current year their cost is estimated at £24,783. The office expenses have increased from £22.967 to £35,970 in the same period. 136 Under both these heads the cost has increased by more than 50 per cent.,, although the number of scholars in average attendance has increased by no more than 4*12 per cent. The enormous increase of expenditure under every head clearly indicates that a more minute attention to detail on the part of the Members, would effect a considerable saving without impairing the efficiency of the work for which the Board was created. It therefore seems important to impress upon the electors at the forthcoming election that only those Members should be returned who have the capacity and the time to master the mass of detail comprised in the Administration of the Board, and the determination to restrict the expenditure of public moneys within the narrowest possible limits, consistent with the efficiency of the Schools. The Vestry suggested a conference of representatives from local authorities either in each electoral division, or in the aggregate, with a view to awakening public attention to the matter. Whether from indifference, despair, or other causes, however, only about one-fourth of the local authorities expressed their willingness to take joint action, and no conference was therefore held. In order to excite public interest in this Parish, the Vestry granted the use of the Vestry Hall, free of charge, to such of the candidates as desired to hold a public meeting, and several such meetings, were held. It is gratifying to know that in the Westminster Division the four candidates selected for the support of the ratepayers as economists, were returned, and that throughout the metropolis, the so-called "Progressive " candidates were either rejected or returned low on the poll. The Vestry, therefore, look with some confidence to a diminution in the School Board rate during the term of office of the newly-elected Board. 137 The School Board took exception to a neighbouring Vestry (St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster) having issued a circular to their ratepayers impressing upon them the importance of the issue at stake in the Election of the Board, and curtly called upon the auditors to surcharge the Vestrymen with the expenses incurred thereby. The reply of the Auditors to the Clerk of the Board, so admirably expresses the relations which exist between Vestries and the ratepayers in the matter of the School Board rate that it is given in full as follows :— Sir, We are duly in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant. Without admitting your authority to address us upon the subject of the Vestry's expenditure in relation to the issue of a circular, or commenting1 on the needlessly peremptory tone of your letter, we have agreed, being actuated by a sense of public duty, to transmit the following observations thereon : Under ordinary circumstances we should not have met until the month of May, but we feel that to have held this matter over until then might have been construed into indifference or unwillingness on our part to look into the matter at once. We have, therefore, held a Special Meeting. We are quite unable to find anything tending to bias for or against any person or party, or that the circular was used for the purposes of "agitation," as your letter suggests. On the contrary it is satisfactorily established by the minutes of the Vestry and its Finance Committee, which have been produced to us, that the circular in question was agreed upon on 24th September, before any candidate had publicly announced himself—and more than six weeks before it could definitely have been known whether or not a contest would take place. Every member of the Vestry had a copy of the circular sent to him on 10th October, and it was unanimously agreed to on 14th idem at a thoroughly representative meeting of the Vestry, in public, at which fifty-five members were present. Your letter implies either a want of knowledge of the Metropolis Local Management Act, or that a school rate of a shilling in the £ is 138 not "a public concern," to the remedying of which the Vestry, as the rating authority, have a full legal right to call the attention of the ratepayers. The object of the circular is so transparent on the face of it. that it is difficult to understand how any unbiassed person could 'interpret it otherwise than as a reminder to the ratepayers that the then coming election would afford them an opportunity of improving that of which they had so frequently complained—the inexcusably excessive rate necessary for School Board purposes. It is a matter of surprise to us that so important a body as the School Board for London should have acted with so much precipitancy and with so little apparent appreciation of the provisions of the / Metropolis Management Acts as their letter discloses; and we fear that it is but an additional proof that resolutions of the Board are too often passed hastily and without due consideration. You will not, therefore, expect us to take any steps to prevent an expenditure of which we, as the duly elected representatives of the ratepayers, entirely approve. The Vestry have throughout maintained the position that the work of popular education is so important to the •community that the Board entrusted with the work should vigilantly watch the expenditure of every penny they raise. It is a desire to strengthen the work of education which has led the Vestry to adopt the action they have. They are of opinion that the work might be done as well, or better, at a cost of £400,000 a year less than at present, and it is not education but extravagance and maladministration against which their efforts have been •directed. We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants, (Signed) Robert E. H. Goffin, Chairman. R. Morgan, T. Bull, Thos. Hy. Hobbs, Chas. T. Cowley, The Auditors elected under the Metropolis Local Management Acts, 139 The V estry have received other communications relating to School Board matters, upon which they have not seen their way to take any effective action. These include a letter from the Vestry of St. Nicholas, Deptford, suggesting united action by the rating authorities either in combining to refuse to collect the amount of the precept of the School Board, or in promoting legislation to restrict the expenditure of the Board, and a letter from the Vestry of St. Anne, Westminster, suggesting the assessment of public elementary schools at a moderate amount. SCHOOL BOARD ELECTORAL DIVISIONS. The Vestry have more than once expressed an opinion in favour of the assimilation of the Electoral Divisions for Schoool Board purposes with those for Parliamentary and County Council purposes, and therefore readily took part, by three of their numbers, in a conference convened by the Vestry of St. Pancras for pressing the question on the consideration of the Government. The suggested alteration in the Electoral Divisions would involve the abolition of the cumulative system of voting, but this system is confined to School Board Elections, and there is no apparent reason why it should be continued for the election of one only of many Boards constituted for administrative purposes, especially as it has not proved particularly beneficial in operation. EVENING OPENING OF ROYAL ACADEMY. In anticipation of the opening of the Annual Exhibition of the Royal Academy in 1891, the Vestry concurred with the Vestry of Clerkenwell in expressing a hope that the 140 governing body might see their way to opening the Exhibition every Saturday evening throughout the season. The Secretary, however, replied that the reasons which had induced the President and Council to arrive at an adverse decision on a former occasion were such as no circumstances are likely to alter. STREETS WITHIN " SPECIAL LIMITS." The Vestry have received from the Commissioner of Police a revised list of streets declared to be within the provisions of section 5 of the Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867, as from the 1st January, 1892. The list contains the names of Coventry Street, Piccadilly, Tichborne Street, Jermyn. Street, and St. James's Street, and the effect of declaring: them to be within the provisions of the section named is to prohibit the removal of ashes, dust, or refuse from any premises in either of the streets between the hours of 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. STREET MARKETS. In the month of December, the London County Council, who are conducting an inquiry into the market accommodation of London, applied for particulars relating to authorised and unauthorised markets in this Parish. There is no authorised market in St. James's, and only one unauthorised market, the street market in Berwick Street and Peter Street. The latter, however, extends over a rather large area, and is of considerable importance, especially to the poorer classes of the inhabitants, who are thus frequently enabled to purchase at a cheap rate articles 141 of food with which the market, at the moment, happens to be over supplied. In reply to specific questions, the Vestry informed the Council that the street market referred to causes little interference with traffic; that the majority of the shopkeepers in the neighbourhood are in favour of its being retained ; that it could not easily be moved to another place ; that it might be allowed to expand naturally northward in Berwick Street and into Broad Street; that it should not be restricted to perishable articles of food only, but open to all classes of goods except such as are likely to spread contagion or infection, as second-hand clothing ; that it should not be limited to vendors resident in the district ; and that no sufficiently useful purpose to justify the trouble would be served by registering or licensing the vendors. DISTURBANCES AT EASTBOURNE. The Vestry had before them, in January, a communication from the Mayor of Eastbourne, on the subject of the recent disturbances in that town arising from the Salvation Army conducting services in the public streets, in a manner which met with opposition from a number of the residents. At the same meeting the Vestry also had before them a statement and documents on the same subject sent to them by the Salvation Army. It appeared to the Vestry that the principle of local self-government, which forms the basis of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, under which Eastbourne is governed, entitles the majority of residents of a locality to decide as to the extent to which the unauthorised, but often tacitly acknowledged, use of public thoroughfares and other 142 places should be permitted. It is not contended that the Mayor and Corporation do not represent the view of the majority of the residents in the action they have taken on this particular subject, and the Vestry therefore passed a resolution expressing sympathy with the local authority of Eastbourne and regret at the attitude which the Salvation Army have thought fit to adopt. PROPOSED PURCHASE OF TRAMWAYS BY THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. The Vestry have passed a resolution concurring with the views of the Wandsworth District Board of Works and other local authorities, objecting to the proposal of the London County Council to purchase part of the Tramway system in the Metropolis. LEGALISED PROJECTIONS. The High Court of Justice (Queen's Bench Division) having held in the case of Fortescue v. Bethnal Green Vestry, that a builder might, under the 26th section of the Metropolitan Building Act, erect pilasters projecting into the public street, notwithstanding such projection extends over ground actually purchased at the public expense for the purpose of widening the street, the Vestry supported the representations of the Vestry of Bethnal Green to the London County Council, in favour of legislation to prevent such encroachments in the future. STATE OF THE RIVER THAMES. Early in October the Vestry had before them a letter from the Woolwich Local Board, asking for support to their representations to the London County Council with 143 ence to the foul state of the Thames, which it was alleged is due to the Metropolitan main drainage outfalls, and the urgent necessity of steps being taken for purifying the river at the earliest possible date. The Vestry recognise the importance of the subject, but as the question is one of some magnitude, involving the disposal of the sewage of London, and was, at the time, receiving the consideration of the Council, they did not think that any useful purpose would be served by pressing the matter at the moment, and the Woolwich Local Board were informed accordingly. CAB RADIUS. The Vestry have supported the representations of the Vestry of Hammersmith to the Home Secretary in favour of the extension, by at least a mile, of the existing cab radius of four miles from Charing Cross. Since this radius was decided upon, nursery grounds and market gardens,, both within and without the radius, have given place to streets of houses, and the distinction which was then justified has ceased to be necessary for the protection of cabmen against an unremunerative return journey from the suburbs, at least during the day time. DEATH OF THE RIGHT HON. W. H. SMITH, M.P. The announcement of the death of the distinguished representative of the Borough of Strand in Parliament was received with deep regret by the Vestry, many of the members having become personally acquainted with him during his long connection with public affairs in the 144 locality. The following resolution was unanimously passed on the 15th October, and a copy sent to Mrs. W. H. Smith :— That this Vestry place on record their appreciation of the eminent and invaluable services rendered by the Right Hon. W. H. Smith to the inhabitants of London as member of the London School Board and other local bodies ; to the country, and especially to his con stituents. as a member of Parliament; and to the State in various capacities. The Vestry further desire to teader their most respectful sympathy and condolence to his widow and family in their bereivement, and to assure them that they will long cherish with affectionate regard the memory of one who endeared himself to all who knew him by his high character and an unselfish devotion to the public good. An acknowledgment was, in due course, received from Mr. W. F. D. Smith,who, in the meantime, had succeeded his father as member for Strand, expressing the grateful thanks of his mother and himself for the Vestry's sympathy and warm appreciation of his father's character and services to the country. DEATH OF THE DUKE OF CLARENCE AND AVONDALE. The death of H.R.H.the Duke of Clarence and Avondale eldest son of the Prince of Wales, after only a few days' illness, and in prospect of an early marriage, naturally excited widespread sympathy. At their first meeting after the sad event, the Vestry unanimously passed the following resolution :— That this Vestry regret most deeply the death of His Royal Highness, the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, and join most sincerely in the sympathy so generally expressed with their Royal Highnesses the 145 Prince and Princess of Wales, and other members of the bereaved family, especially the Princess May, who was bo soon to have been united to His Royal Highness in marriage. The Vestry pray that the relatives of His Royal Highness may, in this hour of thf-ir affliction, be supported with Divine strength,and trust that they may also derive consolation from the spontaneous evidences of sympathy which have been evoked from all races and classes of Her Majesty's subjects, manifesting as they do the heartfelt interest in the happiness of the Royal Family, which is felt by an attached and devoted people. A copy of the resolution was forwarded to General Sir Dighton Probyn, with a request that he would be good enough to submit the same to their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales at a fitting opportunity,, and in due course a reply was received from Sir Dighton, conveying the thanks of the Prince and Princess of Wales to the Vestry for their resolution of sympathy on the occasion of their Royal Highnesses' great bereavement. CONCLUDING REMARKS. The Vestry have not attempted in the foregoing Report to touch upon mere routine business requiring attention from day to day, but have endeavoured to submit to their fellow-parishioners, in as clear and succinct a manner as possible, a statement of the principles which have guided them in the discharge of their trust, and particulars of the present condition of the Parish. < By order.

REPAIRS TO WOOD PAVING, Laid in the Parish in former years, were carried out as occasion required, and amount to— £ s. d. Argyll Place 1 2 9 Argyll Street 7 15 1 Charles Street 11 13 9 Coventry Street 49 15 3 George Street 4 8 7 Haymarket 8 9 1 Jermyn Street 19 18 11 Pall Mall 146 19 8 Piccadilly 226 18 3 Regent Street 109 6 1 St. James's Street 72 13 9 Shaftesbury Avenue 6 7 3 Swallow Street 3 8 8 Wardour Street 23 13 8 £692 10 9 152 As stated last year, the wood paving in the main thoroughfares is very severely tested by the enormous number of omnibuses using these streets in consequence of the narrow wheels they have for the heavy weight they carry, and it has again been necessary to relay portions of the paving at the regular stopping-places in Regent Street and Piccadilly. ASPHALTE. Dufour's Place and St. James's Place were paved with asphalte in August last by the French Asphalte Company, at a cost of 12s. 9d. per square yard. The area paved in Dufour's Place was 439⅔ square yards, and in St. James's Place 682½ square yards. The asphalte was laid two inches thick in each case, on six inches of Portland cement concrete in Dufour's Place, and on the old concrete made up to the required level in St. James's place. Dufour's Placewas previously paved with granite pitching and St. James's Place with wood. Six cab stands in the Haymarket were also paved with asphalte, at the joint expense of your Vestry and the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. WOOD PAVING. In August last, the granite paving of the Haymarket was taken up by the Improved Wood Pavement Company and replaced with new Sin. by 9in. by Gin. pickled yellow deal paving blocks, laid upon the old concrete foundation after all defective places had been made good and the surface floated. The area of the paving was 2717⅓ square yards and the cost 7s. 5d. per square yard. 153 PITCHED PAVING. The carriageways of Babmaes Mews (part), Ramilies Street (part), and Marlboro' Mews, were repaved with the pitching removed from the Haymarket. CARRIAGEWAY ENTRANCE. A carriageway entrance was formed across the footway opposite No. 8, Carlton Gardens, at the request and expense of the occupier of the premises. FOOTWAYS. The following work was carried out on the footways:— York stone relaid, 37,162 square feet, granite kerb reset, 2,945 feet run. These dimensions include 9,278 square feet of new York stone, and 954 feet run of new kerb. The footway paving and kerbing of Wardour Street (west side between Edward Street and Oxford Street) were taken up and relaid, and also small portions of the footway paving of sundry other streets. The "Eureka" paving in Piccadilly, between Albemarle Street, and Old Bond Street, was broken up and replaced with York stone. OLD MATERIALS. The quantities of old materials sold were 337 square feet of York stone paving, 47 loads of wood, and 2,874 square yards of pitching. REFUGES. At the request of the Commissioner of Police the Refuge on the south side of Piccadilly Circus was moved about 10 feet farther south to give the vehicular traffic more room to turn. 154 A new Refuge, lighted by one of Sugg's 80-candle "Lambeth" lamps was constructed in Coventry Street, on the east side of the Haymarket. Two new Refuges, lighted by Sugg's 80-candle "Lambeth" lamps, were also constructed in the Haymarket during the repaying of the carriageway, at the joint expense of your Vestry and the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. GAS AND WATER MAINS. During the year new mains have been laid in the Streets, or old ones replaced with new, as follows :— By the New River Company: In Duck Lane.

Report upon Articles Analyzed during year 1891 238 211 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, for the year 1891. The figures given by the Census of 1891 show that, since the Census of 1881, the resident population in St. James's has fallen from 29,941 to 24,993—a reduction of nearly 5,000, or one-sixth from the enumeration of 1881, A corresponding correction will have to be made in the estimated death-rates which have been calculated for recent years. The District of the Parish of St. James's covers an area of 162 acres, and, with a population of 24,993, now contains 154'22 persons per acre against 184 per acre in 1881. The mean density of the population in Registration London, by the Census of 1891, is 56.5 persons per acre. O 2 212 The following table shows the separate Families, Houses, and Population in each of the 19 enumeration districts of the sub-district of St. James, Westminster, as given by the Registrar's summary (as yet unrevised) from the Census of 1891.

Against these deaths, as affecting the District of St. James's, Westminster, are to be set the deaths of strangers who come to London for medical advice and die in hotels and lodging houses. A very large number of hotels and lodging houses exist in St. James's, and in St. James's these deaths have in former years been taken as balancing those from St. James's occurring in outlying institutions, though the deaths of strangers occurring in the Union House, and in the Throat Hospital, being precisely ascertainable, have always been deducted from the gross mortality occurring in St. James's.

EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P., Lond., F.R.M.S., F.C.S., &c., Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for St. James's, Westminster. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen,— During the year 1891, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, 60 samples were examined, all which were procured for examination by the Vestry Officers. In none of the samples was any poisonous ingredient discovered. No money or consideration other than the stipend paid by the Vestry has been received by me in connection with, these analyses. I have the honour to remain, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 29, Dover Street, Piccadilly. 239 Samples submitted for Examination during year 1891. Article. Quality. Remarks. 1 Water Bright, Colourless and well Aerated The combination of Snow and Fog carried the Fog down into the Reservoirs of the Water panies. The prolonged Frost, followed by the large Rain-fall at the end of January caused a flood of muddy and filthy water in the Thames. In the month of February a remarkable drought followed. 2 Water Not Bright 3 Water Bright, ColourlesB and well Aerated 4 Water Not quite Colourless 5 Water Not quite Colourless 6 Milk Genuine Milk Solids 12.84 % ???
