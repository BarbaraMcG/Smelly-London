MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, 2,195 marriages, 9,917 births, and 5,321 deaths were registered in the parish of Islington during the year 1879, the estimated population on June 1st being 277,363. When I write my next report the census returns for 1881 will probably be published, and we shall in this way be able to correct any errors of calculation in the birth and death rates during the past decade. To the sanitarian these census returns are regarded with the greatest possible interest, and no labor should be spared by the public to render the records accurate and trustworthy.

The annual marriage rate for England and Wales was 14.4 on the estimated population. It is a significant fact that the general marriage rate is slowly and definitely decreasing. In this matter we can only hope that improved trade may remedy the evil. 4 BIRTHS, 1879.—Table No. II. Western District. Eastern District. Whole Parish. Male. Female. Total. Male. Female. Total.

The natural increase of population in Islington, therefore, during 1879, was 4,596. In London 134,096 births were registered. The birth rate, therefore, for all London was 365 per 1,000, the natural increase of the population of London being 48,550 souls. I append a table giving certain details since 1860 of the birth rate in our parish, and its relationship to the death rate as shown by the excess of registered births over registered deaths. 5 Table No. III.

In 1879 (the year consisting of 53 weeks) 5,321 deaths were registered as having occurred in the parish. This gives 191 as the death rate for the year, which is identical with the death rate of the previous year, but if the mortality of the fifty-third week be excluded from the calculation the death rate of the 52 weeks would be 18.8. I would draw attention here to a marked peculiarity in the death rate for 1879, viz., its extreme irregularity. Thus, during the winter months, the severe weather and the intensity of the London fogs proved exceptionally trying to the very young and old; but so accurately was this unusual death rate balanced by the exceptionally low death rates at certain other periods of the year that, in taking the average of the whole, the annual mortality was equalised. Of the 5,321 deaths in 1879, 2,668 were males, and 2,653 were females; 2,235 of the deaths occurred in the western district (of which number 1,099 were males), and 3,086 in the eastern (1,569 being males).

There are, however, one or two points to which it is my duty specially to direct your attention. First, it will be noted that the deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs (more especially bronchitis) are far above the average— indeed, above any as yet recorded; whilst, as a consequence, we have also the highest recorded number of deaths from diseases of the heart. This is as we should expect. Any interference in the efficient aeration of the blood by morbid states of the air passages and lungs, reacts on the heart by interfering with the supply of the needful stimulant required for its perfect action. I need only, however, in explanation of the excessive mortality from these causes (which, let me add, is far above the normal increase coincident with increase of the population), will be easily understood by reference to the extraordinary meteorological conditions of the year, to which I have referred in another portion of this report. Secondly, I desire to direct attention to the epidemics that occurred during the year. As regards Measles, 219 deaths are recorded; and this, so far as we have records, is unprecedented. In 1877 there were 157 deaths from this cause; in 1873, 153 deaths; in 1866, 152 deaths; in 1871, 148 deaths; in 1868, 147 deaths; and in 1874, 134 deaths, these being the years when the mortality from measles was excessive. All the cases, except nine, occurred in children under 5 years of age. It is somewhat remarkable that nearly the whole of the 119 cases of death that occurred during the year from measles, took place between April and August. These are the months when, perhaps, least attention is paid to draughts and to keeping the patients sufficiently warm, and probably it is to these causes, amongst others, the particularly fatal character of the outbreak is to be traced. As regards Whooping-cougli, 229 cases of death are recorded during the year. The epidemic was severe, but was exceeded in 1878, when 296 cases were recorded, and in 1869, when 324 cases 9 and in 1872, when 273 cases were severally recorded. Of the 229 cases of death that occurred during the past year 218 were of children under 5 years old, whilst only one case of death is noted in a person above 15. Scarlet Fever was somewhat more or less prevalent during the whole year, but the deaths were not unusually numerous. During the whole of the year Small-pox was more or less prevalent throughout London. Although it is true the deaths recorded in the table from small-pox are few, nevertheless it is important to bear in mind that the prevalence or not of small-pox in any given district cannot be accurately guaged by the mortality alone. And the reason of this is obvious—viz., that it is the one disease where so soon as it makes its appearance patients of the poorer, and even middle classes, are removed to hospitals. Thus a parish may apparently be, so far as death returns indicate, actually free from the disease, whilst all the time patients are being removed to the various hospitals fitted for their reception. No more important sanitary question can occupy the minds of our legislators at the present time than the paramount necessity of not only registering deaths, but of registering cases of sickness as well. It is the absence of this information that makes sanitary work difficult; and the public cry of the neglect of sanitary authorities most often means that they do not possess the necessary information on which they can act, because our laws have given them no power to obtain it. And, in illustration of this, the hiding up of local outbreaks of infectious disease affords the best possible illustration. Thirdly, I note that the cases of death from Diarrhcea were far below the average, 104 cases only being recorded. In fact, this is the smallest number of deaths from this cause since 1862. I need do no more than mention the unusually low summer temperature, and the excessive rainfall, and the consequent washing of the roads and flushing of the sewers, as probable causes of the low mortality. 10 METEOROLOGY. The meteorological conditions for the year 1879 were remarkable for their variability; thus low temperatures were recorded every month in the year, the average temperature for the year being 46.2 Fahrenheit, or 3.3 degrees below the average of the previous 38 years. The month of December was colder than any December known in this country, the mean temperature of the month being 67 degrees below the average. The mean of the barometrical values for the year were almost identical with the average of the 38 preceding years, but the readings for the first nine months were below, and for the latter three months above, the average. The rainfall was above the average—viz., 29.0 inches, the falls during the second and third quarters of the year being remarkably excessive. During the year only 983 hours of bright sunshine were recorded at Greenwich, against 1,250 hours in the previous year. I need scarcely say that the fogs during the year were remarkable for their frequency, continuance, and intensity. WATER ANALYSIS.

During the nine months ending December, 1879, I examined 76 samples of food, which were submitted to me for analysis by your Inspectors, no sample having been submitted to me by the public. These consisted of— 25 White Pepper. 24 Mustard. 26 Coffee. 2 Milk. This makes in all 840 samples examined for Islington since my appointment. Both samples of milk were genuine. The peppers (practically without exception) were genuine. In one a little mustard was found, and in another a little rice starch, but I believe that in both of these cases the adulteration was accidental. Of the 26 coffees 16 were genuine, 1 contained less than 5 per cent., and 9 less than 10 per cent. of chicory; otherwise they were perfectly genuine, and I gave no certificate upon which action could be taken. Of the 24 mustards as many as 15 contained a trace of starch, but inasmuch as the quantity was in no case more than a trace, I decided to give no certificate on which to prosecute. THE MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT, 1879-80. From the 1st of April, 1879, to the 31st of March, 1880, 624 bodies have been received at the Mortuary, the daily average being 1.71, as against 1.28 in the previous year. 331 inquests have been held during the same period, the sum of £50. 7s. 6d. having been paid to the vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR, 1879-80. (Table No. VI.) This table of our Sanitary work has been prepared in the usual manner, showing, in the upper portion, the number and variety 14 of the inspections, re-inspections, and calls made by the District Inspectors during the year; and, in the second part, the amendments which have been effected. In addition to these improvements, the three District Inspectors reported during the year that dust was required to be removed from 850 houses, this number not being included in the removals ordered as the result of the special work of the Inspector of Dust, which will be found stated in the note at the bottom of the table. The visits to bakehouses were not so numerous as in former years, "The Bakehouse Regulation Act, 1863," having been repealed by the consolidated "Factory and Workshops Act, 1878," which came into operation on the 1st of January, 1879, and under which the bakehouses will now be inspected by Her Majesty's Inspectors of Factories, who by the 4th section, are directed to give notice of any nuisance remediable under "The Nuisances Removal Acts" to the Sanitary Authority. Whether this new legislation will tend to the improvement of the condition of the bakehouses, or whether they will gradually fall into the state of neglect they were in prior to the passing of the Act of 1863, time alone will show; but there can be no doubt as to the beneficial results of the supervision constantly exercised since the end of 1866-7 by the Vestry as the Local Authority, the reality of which is attested by the 8,279 visits made by your Inspectors to the bakehouses of the parish, as well as by the summonses issued in the worst cases from time to time, when it has been necessary, as an example, to enforce the regulations of the Act, although it must be acknowledged that the bakers of Islington, as a rule, have not been unwilling to meet the requirements of the Sanitary Committee under the Act now repealed. By the authority of the Sanitary Committee, carbolic acid was again used during the summer as in former years, in watering some of the streets. McDongall's powder was also used in the hottest and driest part of the season in the courts, and in connection with the Sunday morning cleansing of the channels of the Essex, Caledonian, and Holloway Roads, where these thoroughfares are used as market-places until late on Saturday nights. 15 SUMMONSES. During the year ending the 25th March, 1880, the Sanitary Committee authorised the issue of three summonses, two for the suppression of nuisances and one for the keeping of cows without a licence. In the last named case a penalty of 10s. with 2s. costs was inflicted upon the defendant, who pleaded guilty to the offence. An order was made in one of the nuisance cases for the owner of some stables and workshops to provide increased privy accommodation for the persons employed, and to pay 18s. costs, and this order was complied with. In the other nuisance case an order was made upon the occupier of a wharf on the Regent's canal, to remove a large quantity of offensive refuse, within fourteen days, and to pay 12s. costs. The costs were paid, but the occupier being a contractor, the Magistrate was subsequently unwilling upon a second summons to enforce compliance with his order, the result being the very gradual removal of the refuse and its existence as a nuisance for many weeks, the deposits being added to at the same time. In this case it must be presumed that the Magistrate was satisfied that the accumulation or deposit was necessary for the effectual carrying on the Contractor's business, and that the accumulation had not been kept longer than was necessary for such purposes, as provided by the 8th section of "The Nuisances Removal Act, for England, 1855." THE SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND COW HOUSES IN ISLINGTON, 1879-80. At the Annual Licensing of 1879 there were 92 applications for the renewal of licences to slaughter houses, which, with one exception were granted. For the renewal of licences to cow houses 53 applications were made, and these also, with one exception, were granted. Two fresh applications for licences to cow houses were made and granted. 91 slaughter houses and 51 cow houses were therefore licensed. The result of my annual inspection was satisfactory. 16 THE DUSTING OF THE PARISH, 1879-80. I have appended, agreeably to my custom, a tabulated statement (Table No. VII.) of the applications for the removal of dust received during the year ending Lady Day, 1880, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the parish. Of the total number of 13,083 received from residents during the year, 9,087 were by letter or postal card, and 3,996 were made personally, or through messengers sent to the Vestry Offices. The 13,083 applications received from the inhabitants were at the rate of 39.5 per cent. of the inhabited houses, as against 47 per cent. in 1878-9, 43.8 per cent. in 1877-8, 71.7 per cent. in 1876-7, and 116.6 per cent. in the last contractors' year 1875-6. I take this opportunity of expressing my entire satisfaction with the work done by your Sanitary Inspectors. Mr. Collingwood's work is beyond all the praise that I can give it, and I am happy in the knowledge that your Vestry also appreciate that work. I remain, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, Vestry Offices, Medical Officer of Health. 31st July, 1880. DEATHS REGISTERED IN ISLINGTON during FIFTY-THREE WEEKS ENDING 3rd JANUARY, 1880. 18 THE YEAR 1879. TABLE No. V.
