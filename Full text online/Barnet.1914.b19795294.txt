MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 40, High Street, Barnet. January, 1915. To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting to you my Fifth Annual Report on the Health of the District for the year 1914. The District is in the Barnet Union, and includes the parishes of Chipping Barnet, Hadley, South Mimms, Arkley, and Totteridge, and has an area of 3,112 acres. The Town, known locally as High Barnet, stands upon a hill at an altitude of 430 feet above sea level. The geological formation consists of gravel overlying beds of London clay upon the hill, while in the valleys the clay comes to the surface. The Town is situated amidst beautiful scenery, and fringes the borders of Hertfordshire and Middlesex, about 10 miles from Charing Cross, on what may be termed the crowning summit of the Northern Heights. The District is bracing and healthy, for which reason it is becoming an increasingly popular residential area. 6 NATURAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS. The population is largely residential, and consists chiefly of people whose occupation lies outside the urban area. Those employed in the District apart from tradesmen and their employees, are mainly skilled workers at dental manufacturing, lithographic, photographic, film, printing, leather dressing, and optical works. Poor Law relief is supplied by a large Workhouse and Infirmary, the Medical Officers and Relieving Officer being resident in the District. A new Infirmary to contain 190 beds is now being erected for the largely increased needs of the Union. The Victoria Cottage Hospital affords additional medical relief for the working and artisan classes. The District is especially rich in almshouses. The Council have an Estate of 14 acres for the Housing of the Working Classes, and have erected 52 cottages thereon. This number is to be increased as occasion demands until the estate is fully developed. Twelve additional cottages homes have been erected in the District by a certain firm for the old persons whom they have pensioned. POPULATION. The population of Barnet, including Totteridge which was taken into the District during the year, was in 1911 (census year) 11,335. In estimating the population of the District the calculations are made to Midsummer. The method of estimating the Population adopted by the Registrar-General is based on the supposition that the rate of increase during the decennial period 1911 to 1921 will be at the same rate as in the previous decennial period. Such an estimate would be approximately correct in a District where the growth is more or less on a natural basis, viz., excess of births over deaths; but in Barnet, occupying as it does the position of a suburb of London, this method is inapplicable, owing to the fluctuation of the population. 7 The more correct method in this case is to take the number of inhabited houses and multiply by the average number of persons per house existing at the census. The following table shows the number of inhabited houses, together with the estimated population for each parish:— Parish. No. of Occupied Houses. Population. Arkley 172 817 Chipping Barnet 877 4378 Hadley 86 411 South Mimms 1132 5699 Totteridge 184 903 BIRTH RATE. The nett number of births registered in the District during the year was 214, as compared with 205 in 1913 and 212 in 1912. Of these births 108 were males and 106 female. The Birth Rate, calculated at the rate per 1,000 of the population, is 17.5, as compared with 18.8 in 1913 and 20.2 in 1912. The nett illegitimate births registered give a proportion of 14'2 per 1,000 of the total births. The following table shows the number of births recorded and the birth rate for each parish in the District:— Parish. No. of Births. Birth Rate. Arkley 17 20.8 Chipping Barnet 71 16.2 Hadley 10 24.3 South Mimms 108 18.9 Totteridge 8 8.8 The subjoined table shows by comparison particulars relating to births during the past three years:— 1914. 1913. 1912. Males 108 105 93 Females 106 100 119 Total Births 214 205 212 Legitimate 211 202 208 Illegitimate 3 3 4 Birth Rate 17.5 18.8 20.2 Percentage of Illegitimate Births to Total Births 1.4 1.4 1.9 8 DEATH RATE. 167 deaths were registered in the District during the past year, as compared with 151 in 1913 and 165 in 1912. The crude Death Rate is 13.6 per 1,000 of the population living at all ages, based upon the estimated population for the District. Four deaths of residents belonging to the District occurred in Public Institutions outside the District, while 69 deaths not belonging to the District occurred in Public Institutions within the District. After making allowance for these deaths, a nett Death Rate of 8'3 per 1,000 is obtained. Number of deaths of persons not belonging to the District occurring in Public Institutions outside the District:— The Workhouse 59 Victoria Cottage Hospital 3 Isolation Hospital Nil Holy Infancy Babies' Hospital 6 Other 1 Total 69 Number of deaths of persons belonging to the District occurring in Public Institutions outside the District:— Brompton Hospital 1 City of London Lunatic Asylum 1 Other 2 Total 4 DENSITY OF POPULATION. The District has an area of 3,112 acres. The average number of persons to the acre at the census of 1911 was 6.9. The number of persons to each acre is now estimated at 3.9. Parish Area in Acres.

The District is supplied with water from the mains of the Barnet Water Company. The water is derived from deep wells sunk into the chalk, situate—one at East Barnet, three at New Barnet, one at Potters Bar, and one at Tyttenhanger, Colney Heath. The supply has been good during the past year, and is of undoubted quality. No complaints have been received of insufficient quantity. ANALYSIS.

Tube clear Hardness before boiling 20 degrees Hardness after boiling 5½ „ This is a water of a very high degree of purity as regards freedom from contamination. This is indicated by the results of a vigorous bacteriological examination as well as by those of the chemical analysis. DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. The House Refuse is collected weekly by the Council's own staff and conveyed to the Farm. The refuse tip has been removed from its old position facing Mays Lane to the lower portion of the Farm, and has therefore ceased to be an eyesore. 10 The provision of a small destructor is a subject which must receive the consideration of the Council in the future. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The town is sewered and drained on the separate system. The Sewage is conveyed to an Irrigation Farm of 56 acres, but before it is turned on to the land it is screened and treated by means of detritus and sedimentation tanks and 3 rotary filters. New works were completed early last year at a cost of about £6,000. Pumping is necessary for one sewer, which has its outfall at a low point on the Farm. The Port of London Authority continue to take samples of the effluent, but since the works have been in operation no further complaints have been received. TROOPS (7th BATT. RESERVE, MIDDLESEX REGIMENT). About 1,000 men of this regiment were billeted in the district during the latter part of the year. There was a considerable demand for the men by householders, owing to the liberal scale of pay, and they were well housed and fed. In most cases, two men were allotted to a house. There was very little illness, and no cases of infectious disease were notified. I visited the Barracks immediately upon the the arrival of the regiment, and kept in close touch with their Medical Officer during the stay in Barnet. The houses in which the men were billeted were all supplied by the town's water supply, and fitted with modern water closets. A number of the houses had no bathrooms. I attempted to secure the re-opening of the swimming bath for their use, but was not successful. There were very few cases of drunkenness reported. A large number of recreation rooms and entertainments were provided by local churches and residents. The Isolation Hospital was at the authorities' disposal; antitoxin and a free examination of throat swabs and blood were available for any suspected case of diphtheria or typhoid fever. 11 SCCHOOL INSPECTION. Each of the Schools is visited by me at least once a term. Every child is examined at three different periods during its school life. Any defect found is reported to the parents, who are urged by the school nurse to have such defect remedied. Treatment is provided by the local medical practitioners, by the Victoria Cottage Hospital, Barnet Union Infirmary, and, in a few cases, by London Hospitals. Dental treatment (extractions only) is available at the Cottage Hospital for children whose parents are unable to afford other relief. I am in constant touch with the school teachers on matters of school hygiene, and am frequently consulted by them about suspicious cases of infectious disease. It has not been necessary to close any of the schools for illness during the year. Cases of Tuberculous disease discovered or suspected are immediately referred to the Tuberculosis Officer by the child's family doctor. BELGIAN REFUGEES. There are at present 90 Belgian Refugees living in the district. The organisation is in the hands of the Belgian Refugees' Committee, which is a Sub-committee of the District Council. For the most part, the Refugees are living in houses lent by the owners, and equipped with furniture given or lent by local residents. Each house is under the control of a small committee of ladies and gentlemen, who are responsible for its support and exercise supervision. Free medical attendance is provided by the medical practitioners. No cases of infectious disease have been notified, there is no overcrowding, and the guests are very well housed and fed. Each house has water supply laid on, and is fitted with modern sanitary accommodation. V.A.D. HOSPITALS. Three V.A.D. temporary Hospitals have been mobilized in the district. They are:— 1. Part of a Nursing Home, No. 1, Blenheim Road, which is fully equipped to deal with every variety of surgical case. 12 2. The Ewen Hall. This building can be made ready at 24 hours' notice to receive 30 cases. Arrangements have been made for an operating room, sleeping accommodation for Nurses, and a ward kitchen to be ready when required. 3. A private house in Bedford Avenue is also ready with accommodation for patients. Nursing will be undertaken by V.A.D. Nurses and a staff of fully trained hospital Nurses. Medical Officers have been appointed from the local resident medical practitioners. No patients have yet been admitted to any of these Hospitals. Ambulance classes held in the neighbourhood have been well attended, and many of the students have been successful in the examinations held by the St. John Ambulance Association. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The rate of Infantile Mortality for the past year was 46 per 1,000, as compared with 35 during 1913 and 86 in 1912. The Infantile Mortality for England and Wales was 105. The average rate for the past 10 years has been 94 per 1,000. The rate is calculated as the ratio of infant deaths to births per 1,000. The Notification of Births Act, 1907, has not been adopted in this district. Infantile Mortality has a variety of causes, among which alcoholism, impure food and contamination of infants' food, improper feeding, impure milk, insanitary conditions, and overcrowding are noteworthy. The very gratifying fall in the infantile death-rate coincides with the elimination of insanitary property and surroundings in which many of the children previously lived. The workmen's dwellings, health visitor, increased knowledge of infant feeding, and an increasing purity in the milk supply have also been powerful factors. Since the Infantile Mortality figures were made up the following deaths have been allocated to this District by the Registrar-General: 7 in the “Holy Infancy Babies' Hospital." 13 These children were born in a London Hospital, were transferred when 10 days old to the Abbey Road Home, Hampstead, and finally sent to Barnet; 5 reached Barnet in a dying condition; the other 2 were of premature birth, and died shortly after arrival. If these children's deaths are to be included in my figures the Infantile Mortality rate becomes 79 instead of 46. These deaths cannot have any relation to the Sanitary Condition of the District, as the children were brought here dying. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The number of deaths from diseases of this class was 3, as compared with 2 in the previous year. The number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified during 1914 was 106. Of this number, 36 were Tuberculosis, and 23 Chicken-pox, which latter disease has been made notifiable during the period of the war, at the instance of the Local Government Board, the reason for this step being the close resemblance of the disease in its early stages to Smallpox, consequently in the event of an outbreak of Small-pox a mild case of the disease is not so likely to go unrecognised, as the Health Department is enabled to exercise a supervision over cases notified as Chicken-pox, which they would not otherwise be able to do. The following table shows the number of Notifications to the Sanitary Authority during the year, of each disease specified in the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act and subsequent orders, and the number removed to Hospital:— Nature of Infectious Disease. Notified. Removed to Hospital Smallpox ... ... Scarlet Fever or Scarlatina 25 20 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 12 10 Enteric (Typhoid) Fever ... ... Typhus Fever ... ... Cholera ... ... Relapsing Fever ... ... Continued Fever ... ... Erysipelas 10 ... Pulmonary Tuberculosis 36 ... Cerebro Spinal Fever ... ... Acute Poliomyelitis ... ... Chicken-pox 23 ... 106 30 14 I am constantly being consulted by school teachers on matters of hygiene and doubtful infectious cases, with the result that all suspicious cases are excluded for observation and treatment by their own doctors. This method, together with the regular disinfection of the school buildings every vacation, has helped to check outbreaks of disease. A school nurse is working in the schools, and great benefit has already resulted. She has proved a very real help in checking and controlling illness among the children. DIPHTHERIA. Most of the cases notified have been of a very mild character. Extensive use of microscopic examination of all doubtful throats is made by the local medical practitioners. The result is that cases presenting little clinical evidence are detected and isolated, and thus many cases are notified that otherwise would escape. Spread of infection is thereby checked, and antitoxin treatment employed early. MORTALITY STATISTICS. Of the 102 deaths, ten occurred under 1 year, four between 1 and 2 years, three between 2 and 5 years, two between 5 and 15 years, four between 15 and 25 years, fourteen between 25 and 45 years, twenty-four between 45 and 65 years, and forty-one over 65 years. Phthisis.—There have been 7 deaths from this disease, as compared with 10 in 1913. The sanatorium benefit of the National Insurance Act has not been in existence sufficiently long to influence the mortality of this disease. Cancer.—This disease was responsible for 12 deaths, as compared with 13 in the preceding year. The obscure nature of this disease renders definite preventive measures impossible. Bronchitis, Pneumonia, &c.—There were 18 deaths from all diseases of respiratory organs. Heart Disease was responsible for 6 deaths, and Senile Decay for 15. 15 There have been no deaths from Childbirth, Influenza, or Whooping Cough. Diphtheria was responsible for 1 death, and Measles 2. PUBLIC HEALTH (Tuberculosis) REGULATIONS, 1912. There were 26 cases notified under the provisions of the above Order, as compared with 42 in 1913, and 23 in 1912. The duties devolving upon the Health Department in carrying out these regulations are very numerous, and entail a considerable amount of time. Not only have all fresh notifications to be attended to, but those patients notified in previous years have to be visited from time to time and kept under observation. All forms of Tuberculosis are notifiable, including Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Tubercular Glands and Bones, and Tabes Mesenterica. Arrangements have been made for the establishment of a Tuberculosis Station in Barnet in accordance with the provisions of the National Insurance Act. The County Tuberculosis Officer or his Assistant is in attendance once a week, and works in conjunction with the local practitioners in the treatment of patients. The premises occupied at present are temporary, and when the Council's new offices are completed the necessary rooms will be allotted for this purpose by arrangement with the County Council. The following table gives particulars of the cases notified during the past year and action taken in respect of them:— PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBER CULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1912.

The Inspector possesses the special qualification as Inspector of Meat and other Foods, granted by the Royal Sanitary Institute. The Local Government Board lay great stress upon the desirability of all Inspectors holding this qualification as a proof of their expert knowledge of food inspection, and in their memorandum as to annual reports require information as to the possession of such qualification. PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. There are seven schools in the District, viz.: Arkley C.E. Infants' School; Barnet R.C. Girls' and Infants' Departments; Barnet C.C. School with Boys' and Girls' Departments; Christ Church School with Boys,' Girls,' and Infants' Departments; Hadley Infants' School; Moxon Street Infants' School, and Totteridge Infants' School. The sanitary accommodation is good and the water supply is adequate and pure. VACCINATION. The following information regarding Vaccination in the District has been supplied by the Vaccination Officer:— Returns of Vaccinations and Statutory Declarations of objection to Vaccination in the Barnet Urban District during the year ending 31st December, 1914, as compared with former years. No. of Cases. 1914. 1913. 1912. Certificates of successful Vaccination of children under the age of 14 years 85 90 115 Statutory Declarations of Conscientious Objection to Vaccination 120 112 80 The above returns do not include re-vaccinations or primary vaccinations of persons above the age of 14 years; no reliable figures relating thereto being available. The large percentage of children unvaccinated in recent years gives cause for much uneasiness, and is bound to be a serious factor during future outbreaks of smallpox. 19 HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890.

SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT. HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 40, High Street, Barnet, January, 1914. To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting to you my Sixth Annual Report, giving particulars of the measures carried cut in my Department during the year 1914 in administering the numerous Health Acts and Bye-laws in force within the district. The Council will readily understand that owing to my having taken a Commission in His Majesty's Forces early in the year for the period of the War it has not been possible for me to compile such a detailed report as in former years, although the quality and quantity of work carried out was well up to that of any previous year. The report will therefore contain the work carried out during the year chiefly in table form, and much of the usually written portions must perforce be omitted. COMPLAINTS. The number of complaints received during the vear was 122. These were enquired into, and the necessary notices served. 35 The following table shows the nature and number of the complaints in which action was taken:— NATURE OF COMPLAINT. No. Choked condition of drains 2 Defective drains 16 Dilapidated paving of yards 2 Absence of paving 3 Defective and obsolete water closet cisterns 1 Non-removal of house refuse 5 Offensive accumulations 20 Nuisance from smoke 1 Houses not provided with dust receptacle 12 Damp walls 3 Defective roofs 1 Overcrowded houses 3 Dirty houses 2 Insanitary condition of premises 6 Offensive public-house urinals 1 Defective water-closets 6 Fowls improperly kept 5 Defective eaves and down spouting 19 Miscellaneous 14 Total 122 MEAT INSPECTION. Visits have constantly been paid to the Slaughter Houses in order to see that the meat supply is wholesome and free from disease. On one occasion my attention was called to the carcases of three pigs. Upon examination I noticed external signs of Swine Fever. The entrails had been thrown into the manure barrel, but fortunately I was able to recover them. These exhibited on their internal surfaces characteristic lesions and enteritis. Necrosis of the tissue was present in the cœcum and round the ileo-cœcal valve and there were small ulcers in the colon. Some of the necrotic patches showed the typical black centre. I was satisfied that it was swine fever, and accordingly informed the local Inspector under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, who wired to the Board of Agriculture. The Board sent an Inspector down, who took away portions of the intestines for examination in the Government Laboratories. This examination confirmed my diagnosis. 36 As the entrails had not been kept separate, some difficulty arose as to the affected carcases, as in one instance the entrails showed no sign of the disease. After concurring with the Inspector it was agreed that I should seize two of the carcases which showed signs of the disease, while in the case of the remaining carcase, with the exception of one of the hind quarters which had an affection of the lymphatics, it was passed for food. On one occasion 57 pairs of kippers were submitted for my examination. They were found to be in a state of decomposition. The hawker voluntarily surrendered them, and I granted him a certificate in order to obtain a refund of the price paid for them. The kippers were destroyed upon receipt of Magistrate's order. INFECTIOUS DISEASES PREVENTION ACT, 1890. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The Zymotic Diseases enumerated below have been investigated and reported upon to your Medical Officer of Health, as compared with 1913 and 1912. Nature of Disease. Year 1914. Year 1913. Year 1912.

The following table shows the number and nature of the samples taken in the Urban District of Barnet during the past year, with the results of analysis:— Article. Number of Samples taken. Genuine Adulterated. Extent and Form of Adulteration. Remarks. Butter 6 6 ... ... ... Cream 2 2 ... ... One Sample declared as preserved Cream. Lard 1 1 ... ... ... Milk 8 8 ... ... Totals 17 17 ... ... ... The Board of Agriculture suggest that the minimum number of samples which should be taken in any district is 3 per 1,000 of the population. It will therefore be seen that the above number of samples taken is considerably below this minimum. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. WORKSHOPS. Five notices of occupation of new Workshops have been received during the year from the Home Office. The total number of Workshops upon the register is 56, being an increase of 4 on the previous year. One Workshop was found to be without the Abstract of the Act affixed as required by sec. 128 of the Act. The Workshops are inspected in order to see that no insanitary conditions exist, and cards are affixed stating the number of persons who may be allowed to work in each room. 38 Attention is paid to the cleansing, limewashing, lighting, and ventilation of the rooms. Where any infringement of the Act was found the occupier was notified to remedy the neglect or default. BAKEHOUSES. The number of Bakehouses upon the register is the same as last year, viz., 9. This includes one underground bakehouse not in use. Inspections were made to see that the special sanitary requirements with respect to bakehouses were being carried out. OUTWORKERS. Six lists of outworkers have been received, and the premises inspected in order to ascertain that the work was being carried out under proper conditions, and that no infectious disease existed. FACTORIES. FIRE ESCAPE AND SANITARY CONVENIENCES. The fire escapes have all been maintained in good condition and free from obstruction, and the sanitary conveniences were found to be sufficient in number, and to be kept in a cleanly condition. Tables, giving particulars of factory and workshop inspection, appear on pages 29, 30, 31. DRAINAGE WORK. This important work has received the same careful attention as in former years. Owing to the number of applications received from time to time from persons who desire to rent or purchase a house, for a certificate that the drainage is in good condition, the Council decided to meet the wishes of such persons, and tests are now made for a fee of 10s. 6d., payable to the Council in advance. The time occupied in carrying out drainage works is very considerable, and necessitates frequent visits to give 39 tions, supervising work in progress, and testing new lengths of drains and sanitary fittings. Drains were reported upon and examined under the provisions of Sec. 41 of the Public Health Act, 1875, while the remaining drains were examined by means of the smoke test. The Council have not been called on during the year to lay any lengths of sewer on private property. The total number of drains to houses and other premises reconstructed during the year was 22. Repeated visits have been paid to works in progress. The reconstruction of these drains has necessitated the laying of approximately 895 yards of glazed earthenware and iron drain pipes; 40 gullies, 18 intercepting traps, 13 pedestal, etc., water closets, 3 soil pipes, and 19 ventilation shafts were fixed; 30 manholes and inspection chambers were built, the number of tests applied to the lengths of drains being 84 water tests and 22 smoke tests. 40 Materials used in Construction, &c.

Thirteen licences were granted to store petroleum. These licences were for varying quantities, from 14 gallons to 2,250 gallons. In two instances I reported to the Council that the regulations under which the licences were granted had not been complied with. The Council decided that the offenders should be written to and informed that in future they would be dealt with under Section 9 of the Act of 1871, which enacts that "Any licensee violating any of the conditions of his licence shall be deemed to be an unlicensed person." The warnings had the desired effect, and the quantity allowed to be kept in each case has not been exceeded. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Yours obediently, CHARLES WILLIAM HILL, Sanitary and Housing Inspector. 42 Summary of Sanitary Work performed in connection with Inspection of District.
