In .accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Vestry present the following Report of their proceedings and an abstract of their accounts for the twelve months ended the 25th March last; also a statement of Contracts entered into or in force during that time, and the liabilities of the Vestry at the end thereof, together with the Report of their Surveyor for the same period, and of their Medical Officer of Health for the year 1889. With a view to affording the ratepayers as complete a knowledge as possible of the administration of parochial affairs generally, the Vestry have appended to their Report, Statements of Accounts relating to the Guardians of the Westminster Union, the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, and the Trustees of Charitable Endowments in which the parish is interested. 14 THE PARISH. Extent.— The Parish occupies an area of 164 acres. It Has about 12½ miles of streets, of which 3½ miles are paved with wood, 5¼ with asphalte, ¾ with pitching, 1½ with macadam, and 1½ mile consists of courts, yards, and passages. Population.—At the last census, which was taken in April, 1881, the resident population was ascertained to be "29,865 persons, and the number of occupied houses 3,018. In this enumeration, however, no account is taken of the large number of persons who are engaged in the Parish during the day, and reside away from their places of business. Local Government.—The Parish has a separate jurisdiction under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and particulars of the powers of the Vestry elected pursuant to that Act are given on page 24. For Poor Law purposes the Parish is joined to the Parish of St. Anne, under the name of the Westminster Union; it is also a constituent part of the Central London Sick Asylum District. Wards.—The Parish has been divided into four wards for the Eleption of Vestrymen, and this Division is followed in the preparation of the Lists of Voters for Member of Parliament, the County Council, and School Board. The name of the Ward is printed on the rate receipt of each ratepayer. For Ecclesiastical Purposes the Parish has been subdivided into five districts, the mother church being St. James's, Piccadilly, of which the Rev. J.E. Kempe, M.A.,is Rector. 15 Representation in Parliament.—The Parish of St. James was formerly comprised in the Parliamentary Borough of the City of Westminster, which returned two members to Parliament; it now, however, forms a part of the Borough of Strand, which returns one member, the present representative being the Rt. Hon. W. H. Smith. The Register prepared in 1889 contains the names of 4,408 Parliamentary electors, viz., 4 on the Scot and Lot List, 300 Lodgers, and 4.104 possessing other qualifications. There are also 603 Countv Electors who have been placed on the Register under the Local Government Act, 1888, but are not qualified to vote for members of Parliament. Parliamentary voters for the County of Middlesex, in respect of property situate wholly or in part in the Parish of St. James, number 179. By the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Westminster Division of the School Board for London. Five members of the School Board are electcd by the ratepayers of the Division. Water Supply.—Four Companies supply the Parish with water, the approximate boundaries of their respective districts being as follows:— 1. Chelsea Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 35, Commercial Road, Pimlico). So much of the Parish as lies to the south of the centre of Pall Mall and Cleveland Row. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1722. 2. New River Company (Chief Office, Clerkenwell, E.C.) So much of the Parish as lies to the east of a line running at the back of the east side of Poland Street, Lexington Street, 16 Great Windn ill Street, and along the centre of the Haymarket. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1610. 3. Grand Junction Waterworks Company (Chief Office. 65, South Molton Street). So much of the Parish as lies to the west of the district supplied by the New River Company and the north of the centre of Pall Mall. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1811. 4. West Middlesex Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 19, Marylebone Road). So much of Oxford Street as issituate within the Parish. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in the year 1806. The rates of charge for a supply cf water for domestic purposes authorised by the various Acts of Parliament relating to the several above-mentioned Companies are almost identical, the scale being as follows:— Where the annual value of the dwelling-house or other place does not exceed £200, a rate not exceeding 4 per cent. per annum; where such annual value exceeds £200, a rate not exceeding 3 per cent. per annum. An additional charge, varying from 4s. per annum where the annual value of the house exceeds £30 but is less than £50, to 12s. where the annual value of the house exceeds £300, is permitted for each single water-closet, fixed bath, or high service ; for each additional water-closet, fixed bath, or high service, half these rates are to be charged. High service is defined as a delivery of water at an elevation of more than ten feet above the pavement in front of the dwelling-house or other place supplied. The Companies may supply water for other than domestic purposes, either upon agreed terms or by meter at a specified rate. 17 Gas is supplied to the whole Parish by the Gas Light and Coke Company (Chief Office, Horseferry Road). The Coroner is Mr. John Troutbeck, whose jurisdiction extends throughout the City and Liberties of Westminster. For the Registration of Births and Deaths the Parish is included in the Westminster District. The SubRegistrar is Mr. Thomas Matthews Crowe, of 31, Ward our •Street; and the Superintendent Registrar, Mr. Joseph Bond, Union Offices, Poland Street. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES. The statement of the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses for the past year shows an increase, both as regards the number of persons using the establishment and the receipts. The Annual Report of the Commissioners, which was presented to the Vestry in January, contains so much matter of general interest that the following extracts are given:— 1. In presenting their customary Annual Report, the Commissioners deem the present an opportune occasion, for two reasons, to extend the scope of their observations beyond the usual period. These reasons are: (1), that during the past year the debt on the Baths and Wash-houses has been extinguished, and (2) that the Commissioners contemplate, with the approval of the Vestry, constructing a first-class Swimming Bath, in order to adapt the establishment to modern requirements. 2. It may not be inappropriate to remark, in the first place, that the Baths and Wash-houses Act was adopted by the Vestry of this Parish in the same year that it was passed (1846). It was not, however, until the 14th June, 1852, that the Baths and Wash b 18 houses in their original form were opened to the public. The building at first occupied the site of only one house in Marshall Street (No. 16), and extended over a portion of the stoneyard in the rear. It was soon evident, however, that the accommodation thus provided was inadequate to the demand, and eight years later, the sites of Nos. 17 and 18, Marshall Street, were placed at the disposal of the Commissioners for an extension of the building. All three houses were already the Freehold Property of the Parish, consequently the Commissioners were not called upon to pay anything for the site. 3. The Baths and Wash-houses, as extended, afford accommodation, in addition to the necessary Offices, Store Rooms, Boiler House, Apartments for the Superintendent, and rooms for administratrative purposes generally, as follows:— Swimming Bath, measuring about 40ft. by 30ft.; Washing Baths, 23 first-class for men and 13 for women—and 44 second-class for men and 13 for women; in all 93; Laundry: 83 Washing Compartments, fitted with steam, hot and cold water, drying horses heated with Steam, Wringers, Mangles, and an Ironing Room. 4. As already stated, the Freehold Site cost the Commissioners nothing. The erection and subsequent extension of the building, including boilers, apparatus, fittings, and fixtures of all kinds, cost £21,000. This sum is exclusive of large sums paid from time to time for renewals and repairs. 5. The whole cost of erecting and equipping the establishment, was defrayed from loan raised on security of the Poor Rate. Four loans were obtained, amounting in all to £21,000, and the sum of £13,061 5s. l0d. has been paid for interest 6. The net cost to the ratepayers, however, has been only £25,621 10s. 1d., for although the sum of £34,971 10s. 1d. has been paid from the Poor Rate for repayment of the loans with interest, and for renewals and repairs when these were exceptionally heavy, the Commissioners have at various times paid sums from their surplus receipts in aid of the Poor Rate, amounting in all to £9,350. From the adoption of the Acts to the present time, therefore, the net cost of the establishment to the ratepayers 19 has been £25,621 10s. 1d., in addition to the value of the freehold site, which, as already stated, had previously become the property of the Parish. It must, however, be borne in mind that for this sum of £25,621 10s. 1d., the Ratepayers have acquired a freehold building with all the apparatus and appliances necessary for carrying on a large business. 7. The Commissioners, however, feel that the value of such an establishment, especially in the midst of a neighbourhood crowded with poor, cannot be computed merely on a pecuniary basis. Nor indeed can the money value be ascertained, for it is beyond question that cleanliness is an important factor in the maintenance of health, which, to the wage-earning classes particularly, is largely equivalent to money. It is also beyond doubt that home comforts have an important bearing on the social condition and moral elevation of the humbler classes, and it is difficult to see how any degree of comfort can he obtained where one room, or perhaps two, has to serve all the purposes of a home, including the Wash-house. 8. The fees charged at the establishment are as follows:— Swimming Bath, 4d, in the early morning, 2d. later in the day, and 3d. on Sunday morning. Washing Baths: cold, second-class 1d., first-class, 3d.; warm, second-class 2d., first-class 6d. Laundry, 2d. per hour, including supply of steam, hot and cold water, and facilities for wringing, drying, mangling, and ironing. The total sum received from bathers and washers from the opening of the establishment, on the 14th June, 1852, to the 31st December, 1889, was no less than £112,831 9s. 8d. Of late years the receipts have averaged about £3,000 per annum, but in 1875 they reached nearly £3,700 (£3,695 l1s. 5d). Since that period, however, considerable alterations have been made in the neighbourhood, and many of the poor have been displaced by street improvements. 9. About 150,000 tickets are issued annually, of which nearly 50,000 relate to the Wash-houses, and about 100,000 to the Baths. From the opening of the establishment to the end of 1889, no B 2 20 less than 1,906,783 tickets have been issued to Washers in the Laundry, and 4,320,928 to Bathers, making together a total of Six Millions Two Hundred and Twenty-Seven Thousand Seven Hundred and Eleven tickets issued. These figures are an eloquent testimony to the value of the establishment. The number of bathers (104,766) shows an increase of close on 7,000 over the figures for the previous year, the increase extending over each department, that is, men's, women's, and swimming. The number of tickets issued for the laundry, on the other hand, shows a decline of nearly 2,000. The Commissioners state that they took advantage of the favourable condition of their finances to pay off the whole balance of the debt (£400) in July last, instead of paying the same by two instalments in January, 1 1890, and January, 1891, respectively. Upon the application of the Commissioners, the Vestry have assented, to the sites of Nos. 19 to 23, Marshall Street, which belong to the Parish, being appropriated to the purpose of extending the Baths, and the proposal now awaits the confirmation of the Local Government Board. The two Commissioners who retired in January by effluxion of time (Mr. Tysall and Mr. Winnett) were reelected. for the usual period. A list of the Commissioners is given on page 12, and a statement of their receipts and expenditure for the year 1889, and the number of bathers and washers, on pages 152 and 153. ARCHBISHOP TENISON'S SCHOOL. Three of the Trustees of Archbishop Tenison's United Schools for the parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and St. 21 James are elected by the Vestry. A vacancy occurred during the year by the expiration of the term for which Mr. Henry Graves had been elected, and was filled up by the unanimous re appointment of that gentleman. A statement of the Accounts of the Schools for the year 1889 is given on page 156. BURLINGTON SCHOOL. This School is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in the year 1875, and two of the Governors are elected by the Vestry. The present representative Governors are Mr. F. H. Bingham and Mr. Joseph Pool. The school fees, which are payable in advance at the commencement of each term, are as follows:— Entrance, 5s. for one pupil, and 2s. 6d. for each additional pupil from the same family. Tuition for a pupil entering the school above the age of 10 years, £1 10s. Od. per term. If more than one pupil from the same family, £1 5s. 0d. for each beyond the first. For a pupil entering the school under the age of 10 years, £1 5s. 0d. per term, so long as she shall continue in the school. Dinners are supplied at 7d. each, or 2s. 6d. for the week of five days. Application for admission should be made to the Head Mistress at the School House, Old Burlington Street, where particulars of the course of study may be obtained. A statement of the Accounts of the School for the vear 1889 is given on page 157. 22 THE CRAVEN PEST HOUSE CHARITY. Five Parishes participate in the benefits of this Charity, viz., St. Martin-in-the-Fields, St. George, Hanover Square, St. Clement Danes, St. Paul, Covent Garden, and St. James. Four of the Trustees are appointed on the nomination of the Vestry, the present representatives of the Parish being Mr. F. Crane, Mr. J. Bonthron, and Mr. W. Winnett. The vacancy caused by the resignation and subsequent death of Mr. Burgess had not been filled up at the close of the year. The income of the Charity is applied, under an order of the Court of Chancery, to the maintenance of 24 beds in King's College Hospital and 16 in Charing Cross Hospital, for the reception of poor patients from the five parishes mentioned. The hospitals are also required to afford out-treatment to all poor persons resident in any of the five parishes, who may be sent by the Trustees. A copy of the Accounts of the Charity for the year 1889 is given on page 158. MRS. ANN NEWTON'S CHARITY. This Charity, for the apprenticing of one poor boy of St. James's annually from the Union School, has hitherto been administered by the Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor, but owing to the abolition of that Board, the management of the Charity will probably be transferred by the Charity Commissioners to the Guardians of the Poor. A copy of the Accounts for the year 1889 is given on page 161.+6 23 LE QUAINTER'S CHARITY. The only Charity which is administered by the Vestry is that known as Le Quainter's. It arises from a bequest, in 1782, by Mr. Peter Le Quainter, formerly a resident in Piccadilly, who directed that the income should be “equally distributed at Christmas amongst twenty poor persons who are or have been housekeepers in the Parish of St. James, Westminster, and such as the Rector and Churchwardens, and the other gentlemen for the time being who shall compose the Vestry of the said Parish, shall deem to be proper objects, and the most deserving to partake of the same." The property of the Charity consists of £9,969 2s. 9d. Two and, Threequarters per Cent. Annuities. Under the scheme for converting the funded National Debt, the income of this Charity has been reduced by nearly £25 per annum. A statement of the Accounts for the past year is given on page 160. ST. MARTIN'S ALMSHOUSE AND PENSIONS CHARITY. This Charity is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in 1886, the governing body comprising ex-officio, co-optative, and representative Trustees. Two of the latter are elected by the Vestry of this Parish, the present representatives being Mr. Morle and Mr. Winnett. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1889 will be found on pages 164 to 167. 24 OTHER PAROCHIAL CHARITIES. A list of other endowed Charities in which the Parish is iuterested is given on pages 168 to 175, and statements of the accounts on pages 159 to 163. THE VESTRY, As constituted by the Metropolis Local Management Act 1855, consists of 48 elected and three ex-officio Members. It superseded an elected Vestry acting under the provisions of the statute 1 & 2 William IV., cap. 60, which was adopted by the ratepayers of St. James's on the 6th April, 1832. All the powers of the former Vestry and of the Paving Commissioners acting under Local Acts, as well as some of the functions of the Commissioners of Sewers, were transferred to the re-constituted Vestry. An Act was passed in the year 1858 relative to the main drainage of the Metropolis, by which the Vestry, as the rating authority of the Parish, were required to meet precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works for a Main Drainage Rate not to exceed 3d. in the pound per annum. In 1862 the powers of the Vestry were enlarged by the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Act, and in the following year tur?pike roads in the Metropolis were transferred from Commissioners, who had power to levy tolls upon horses and other animals and vehicles, to the Local Authorities, whose expenses are defrayed from the rates. The Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act, 1869, and Money Acts of the Board, subsequently passed, besides making some alterations in the mode of assessing the expenses of 25 the Board, have afforded increased facilities for the raising of money by Vestries and District Boards, of which the Vestry of St. James have availed themselves to a small extent. By the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of 1875 and 1879, the Vestry are empowered to purchase samples of food and drugs for analysis, to appoint a Public Analyst, and to prosecute vendors of adulterated articles. Proceedings under these Acts during the past year are mentioned on page 92. The Vestry have also various powers under the Metropolitan Paving Act, 57 George III., cap. 29, commonly known as Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, the Nuisances Removal Acts, the Metropolitan Building Acts, the Metropolis Gas Act, the Sanitary Act, 1866, the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, better known as Torrens' Act, and other statutes. The Local Government Act, 1888, which superseded the Metropolitan Board of Works and created the London County Council, has incidentally varied the incidence of local taxation, and taken a great step in unifying the amount of the Poor Rate in the Metropolis. There has been a growing tendency for some years to include in the local rates various sums for Metropolitan purposes, over the expenditure of which local authorities do not possess the slightest control. Thus, since the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855, the Vestry have at different times been required by Parliament to provide funds for—(a) Main Drainage; (b) Fire Brigade; (c) Elementary Education; (d) Thames Bridges—purchase, maintenance, and rebuilding; (e) Artizans' Dwellings, and 26 other purposes. A statement of moneys raised with the parochial rates for Metropolitan purposes is given on page 36. STANDING ORDERS. Operative Resolutions in the nature of Standing Orders have been passed during the year as follows:— 8th April, 1889. That the springs of all carts be painted every three months by the Vestry's workmen. (W. 11, p. 189.) 8th April, 1889.

That in all licences for hoardings, &c., granted by the Surveyor, the affixing of advertisements to such hoardings be prohibited, and that in the event of any holder of a licence desiring to use the hoarding for advertising purposes he be required to make special application to the Works Committee for permission to do so. (W. 11, p. 309.) 3rd October, 1889. That in future the allowances to the Bate Collectors be paid Quarterly instead of half-yearly as at present. (F. 7, p. 106.) 22nd October, 1889. That each month one member be appointed to visit the premises under the management of the St. James's 27 Dwellings Committee, and report upon any matter requiring the attention of the Committee. (S.

(S. 3, p. 379.) 8th January, 1890. That in future extra time be allowed to the bricklayers and other workmen employed by the Vestry only according to the custom of their respective trades. (W. 11, p. 2.) 8th January, 1890. That the following Regulations for ballasting the streets be approved, subject to any alteration therein that experience may show to be necessary. (W. 12, p. 6.) 1. The foreman of orderlies shall at all times during the day or evening (including Sundays) when the roads become slippery through frost or damp, employ such number of boys, men, horses, and carts as may be necessary to properly ballast the roads to give a firm foothold. 2. In the event of the roads being slippery the first thing in the morning, the foreman of sweepers shall have them properly ballasted until the arrival of the foreman of orderlies. 3. In the event of the roads being very slippery, men are to ba taken off their ordinary work, whether sweeping or paving, to assist in ballasting. 4. In the event of the asphalted roads being slippery during the daytime, the foreman in charge of the carmen, viz., the foreman of sweepers during the morning and the general foreman during the afternoon, shall employ such carmen to ballast the said roads. 28 5. The roads are to be ballasted in the following order, viz. : Lower Regent Street Waterloo Place Pall Mall (East End) St. James's Street Haymarket Regent Street Pall Mall Shaftesbury Avenue Piccadilly Coventry Street Argyll Street Argyll Place Wardour Street Jermyn Street, &c. 6. The asphalted roads are to be ballasted when required, and if necessary simultaneously with the foregoing, commencing with the following: Sherwood Street Air Street Marshall Street Broad Street Market Street, &c. 13th March, 1890. That it be a standing reference to the Finance and House Committee to draw and sign cheques on the Parish Account from time to time in payment of all recognized charges and of all accounts and liabilities referred to them from time to time chargeable upon the Poor Rate. (V. 17, p. 460.) THE ELECTION OF VESTRYMEN AND AUDITORS OF ACCOUNTS Was held on Monday, the 27th day of May, the places appointed for the purpose being—Pall Mall Ward, Willis's Rooms, King Street; Church Ward, Vestry Hall, Piccadilly; Golden Square Ward, National School House, Marshall Street; and Great Marlborough Ward, Board Room, Poland Street. A Poll took place in Golden Square Ward, and the total expense of conducting the elections, including the hire of rooms and publication of notices, amounted to £16 12s. An order for the payment of this sum from the Poor Rate was made by the Vestry in accordance with the Statute. 29 The mortality among the Vestrymen has been unusually heavy, no less than four having died during the year. The vacancies thus caused will be filled up at the election in May, 1890. A list of the Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts will be found on pages 7 and 8. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The following is the number of meetings held during the year:— Vestry Meetings 30 Finance and House Committee 23 Sanitary, Parliamentary Bills, and General Purposes Committee 25 Works and Improvements Committee 26 Sanitary and Works Committees (Joint) 4 Lighting Committee 15 St. James's Dwellings Committee 15 Special and Sub-Committees 3 Total 141 The Vestry usually meet on alternate Thursday mornings, but a special meeting may be convened at any time upon the requisition of five members, and some of the ordinary meetings are suspended at vacation times. Four Standing Committees are appointed annually, in accordance with the byelaws of the Vestry, and meet as frequently as occasion may require. Special Committees are appointed from time to time to consider subjects not coming within the ordinary duties of either of the Standing Committees. 30 LOCAL ELECTIONS. On the 23rcl May, the Vestry passed a resolution expressing concurrence with the Vestry of Chelsea in the view that all elections of local bodies in the Metropolis should be conducted by ballot, and carried out on one Register of Electors, the Vestry Clerks of the various Parishes to be the Returning Officers in their respective areas. The Vestry further expressed their opinion that all such Elections should, as far as practicable, be held on the same day. CHURCHWARDENS. The Vestry appointed Churchwardens on the 25th day of April, when Mr. Samuel Morle was chosen Senior Churchwarden, and Lord Wemyss Junior Churchwarden. On the same day, a vote of thanks to Mr. Frederick Crane, in recognition of his eminent services to the Parish during a lengthy period, was unanimously agreed to, on the motion of the Rector, Chairman of the Vestry, seconded by Mr. James Beal, as follows:— That at the close of the 21st year for which Mr. Frederick Crane has filled the office of Churchwarden of the Parish, the Yestry of St. James, Westminster, desire to place on record their appreciation of the manner in which he has performed the duties of that office. First elected Churchwarden in the year 1850, he wag re-elected at intervals until 1876, since which year he has been continuously re-elected annually. Throughout that lengthened period he has filled the office to the entire satisfaction alike of the Rector and Parishioners. To his indefatigable labours the Parish owes so successful an issue to the protracted inquiry into the Craven Pest House Charity; by his patient efforts the administration of the Tenison Schools and other Charitable 31 Endowments in which the Parish is interested has been strengthened and improved; with rare skill he traced the history of the Conduit Street property, formerly the site of Trinity Chapel, and thus led to the Parish of St. James being admitted to participate in the valuable Almshouse and Pension Charity of the Mother Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields; and by unflagging interest and exertions he succeeded in effecting several improvements in the fabric of the Church. The Vestry tender to Mr. Crane their grateful acknowledgement of his long continued and valuable services to the Parish, not only in these varied ways but also as a Vestryman, and member of many other Parochial bodies, and as a small testimony of his unblemished career and life of usefulness, order this Eesolution to be entered on the Minutes of their proceedings. SIDESMEN Were elected by the Vestry on the 25th day of April, the under-mentioned gentlemen being selected to fill the office:— Mr. James Thomas Robertson, 7, St. James's Street. Mr. James McMillan, 104, Jermyn Street. Mr. Benjamin F. Hawkins, 108, Jermyn Street. Mr. James Malm, 16 & 17, King Street. OVERSEERS OF THE POOR. Eight parishioners were nominated by the Vestry on the 25th day of April, to serve as Overseers of the Poor. The gentlemen chosen from this list, and appointed by the Justices of the Peace, at a Petty Sessions held on the 26th April, to act as Overseers for the year 1889-90, were:— Mr. John Malin, 117, Jermyn Street. Mr. Ephraim Tysall, 24, Poland Street. Mr. James Tapping, 45, Berwick Street. Mr. Frederick Glover, 30, Beak Street. 32 GOVERNORS AND DIRECTORS OF THE POOR. In accordance with the requirements of the Local Act 2 Geo. III., cap. 58, the Vestry met on the 25th April, for the purpose of appointing twenty-one “substantial and discreet" persons, either from their own body, or from among the Justices of the Peace for Middlesex or Westminster, or other "creditable inhabitants" of the Parish, such persons, together with the Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor, to be called Governors and Directors of the Poor. A list of the gentlemen so appointed is given on page 11, and a statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Board on page 154. This is the last occasion upon which Governors and Directors of the Poor will be elected for this Parish, for as the result of'the inquiry to which reference was made in the last Annual Report of the Vestry, the Local Government Board made a Provisional Order (which was duly confirmed by Parliament) repealing as from the 25th March, 1890, the local legislation relating to the Governors and Directors, and transferring the duties and powers of that body to the Vestry. OFFICERS OF THE VESTRY. Vestry Clerk's Department.—A vacancy was caused by the resignation of Mr. T. H. Munsey, First Assistant Clerk, on his obtaining a more lucrative appointment under the Vestry of Islington, and was filled up by the appointment of Mr. D. H. Hose. The salary of the Vestry Clerk was increased unsolicited by £50 per annum, “in order at once to reward and retain his valuable services to the Parish," and that of the Accounts and Rates Clerk has been increased by £20 per annum. 33 Sanitary Department.—The engagement of Mr. A. F. Lawrence, Assistant Inspector of Nuisances, was terminated in April, and in the following month Mr. J. R. Campbell was appointed to fill the vacancy caused thereby, at a salary of £90 per annum. Stoneyard.—The salary of the Stoneyard Clerk has been increased from £100 to £120 per annum. Bate Collectors.—A vacancy was caused by the death of Mr. J. J. Johnson, Rate Collector in the Great Marlborough Ward, on the 4th February, and his son, who had latterly assisted him, was appointed to complete the collection of the then current rates. A list of the Officers of the Vestry and their respective salaries is given on page 143. FINANCIAL. It will be seen on reference to the Accounts commencing on page 136, that the year commenced with a balance in the Treasurer's hands amounting to £8,136 7s. 5d. The sum of £63,234 11s. 11d. was received during the twelve months, and the expenditure for the same period reached a total of £58,293 7s. 0d., leaving a balance of £13,077 12s. 4d. on the 25th March, 1890. Against this cash balance, however, there were, on the last mentioned date, debts and liabilities properly chargeable to income amounting to £11,005 11s. 4d., with assets (exclusive of cash balance) estimated to realise £ 1,289 16s. 1d., leaving a surplus of £3,361 17s. 1d., to be carried to the credit of the present year. LOANS. A statement of the Loans now outstanding is given on page 146. c 34 RATEABLE VALUE. The Assessment of the Parish, according to the valuation list which came into force on the 6th of April, 1886, was as follows:— Gross value £831,835 Rateable value £694,201 Since the preparation of that list several properties have been taken down, and a few houses which have been re-built or altered have come into rating. The alterations in assessment thus made increase the totals of the Valuation List to the following amounts:— Gross value £858,673 Rateable value £715,958 RATES were made by the Vestry during the year as follows:— Amount in. the Pound. Poor Rate (including, in addition to charges for the Relief of the poor, Police Rate, expenses of the London County Council, contributions to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and other general charges) s. d. 2 3 General Rate for the lighting, maintenance, repairing and cleansing of streets, watering carriageways, administration expenses, precepts of the School Board of London, and proportion of the Bridge Expenses of the Metropolitan Board of Works 1 4½ Sewers Rate, for the maintenance, repairing, and cleansing of sewers vested in the Vestry 1 Metropolitan Consolidated Rate, for meeting the final precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works so far as relates to the Fire Brigade, Main Drainage, Metropolitan Improvements, and general expenses of the Board 2½ Total 3 11 The rates for each of the two previous years were 3s. 9d. and 3s. 10d. in the pound respectively. 35 The following statement shows the amount of the rates and the collection thereof:— Poor Rate— £ s. d. Amount of rate as levied 79,200 18 0 Arrears of former rates 451 16 3 Rates on property assessed during the year 760 19 7 £80,413 13 10 Collected 77,369 5 3 Loss from empty houses, &c. 2,095 6 10 Arrears at close of year 953 1 9 £80,417 13 10 Other Parochial Rates— Amount of rates as levied 58,667 6 8 Arrears of former rates 685 5 0 Rates on property assessed for the year 573 8 9 £59,926 0 5 Collected 57,521 11 0 Loss from empty houses, &c. 1,606 17 10 Arrears at close of year 797 11 7 £59,926 0 5 Under the provisions of the Local Acts of Parliament relating to the Parish of St. James, the rates are made annually, but are recoverable by four quarterly instalments. For the convenience of Parishioners, however, it has become the practice to collect the rates in two half-yearly sums. In view of the increasing demands by Central Authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry does not possess any control, although for economy in collection the funds are raised with the local rates, the following statement will be of interest to ratepayers:— c 2 36 Total amount expended, £149,529 3s. 1d.

Metropolitan Asylums District 5,650 2 7 5,035 0 0 7,568 19 0 Central London Sick Asylum 2,785 13 4 2,684 0 0 2,500 0 0 Metropolitan Common Poor Fund 13,279 1 7 8,901 12 11 10,464 9 0 Police 14,607 1 10 14,501 5 4 14,630 2 0 County and Lunatic Asylums Rates 3,615 12 7 3,625 6 3 3,657 10 5 Expenses of School Board 25,573 6 4 24,241 9 6 23,427 7 6 Expenses of Metropolitan Beard of Works 20,155 8 2 22,036 1 3 24,409 3 1 £85,666 6 5 £81.024 15 3 £86.657 11 0 37 The payments to Central Authorities last year amounted to £5,632 15s. 9d. more than for the previous year, and to 991 15s. 7d. more than for the year 1886-7. It will be seen that of the total sum raised under the name of local rates, a very small proportion is applicable to strictly local expenditure, no less than £96,481 0s. 4d. of the total of £149,529 3s. 1d. having been paid over during the year to various authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry and other Parochial Boards have no control. In other words, out of every shilling raised as local rates in St. James's, less than fivepence is spent by the Parochial Authorities. An important alteration in the incidence of local taxation has been made by the Local Government Act. The greater part of the money raised by the Metropolitan Board of Works was raised as a sewers rate, and, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, was recoverable as such by the occupier from the owner of the property assessed. The Local Government Act, however, directs that the expenses of the Council (in which are included the expenses formerly raised by the Metropolitan Board of Works) shall be raised as a County rate, that is, wholly from the occupier and without any partial or total exemption, such as land and certain other properties are entitled to in the case of a sewers rate. This alteration does not affect the ratepayers of St. James's to any great extent, and its importance lies rather (so far as this Parish is concerned) in a departure from an old principle of rating and transferring to the occupier of property a burden hitherto borne by the owner. The Vestry have on many occasions suffered considerable loss in rates from frequent changes of the occupier of licensed premises, owing to the incoming tenant repudiaiing the 38 liability of his predecessor, from whom, however, he receives not only the licence but also the whole beneficial interest in the premises. There is a legal difficulty in attaching a liability of the kind to the owners or mortgagees, such as the brewers or distillers, who are very often the sole persons benefiting by the licence being kept alive. After carefully considering the subject the Vestry have resolved to call the attention of the Licensing Justices to each case where the outgoing occupier has failed to pay the rates, with a view to the Justices considering whether the licence should not be terminated. It would appear that if a business is not sufficiently profitable to admit of payment of ordinary expenses such as rates, the licence is not required in the interest of the public, and that the application for transfer or renewal under such conditions comes within the conditions contemplated in the case of Wakefield v. Sharp. At the request of the London County Council, who called attention to the large sums collected annually for so-called volunteer fire brigades and for societies for the relief of disabled firemen, who are in no way connected with the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the Vestry have caused to be printed on their Demand Notes for rates an intimation that “under no circumstances whatever are the men of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade allowed to solicit money for any purpose." COAL DUTY. On the 9th May, the Vestry passed a resolution in favour of the renewal of the London Coal Duty for a limited period, for the purpose of securing an improved water supply or for effecting metropolitan improvements. The 39 duty which was formerly paid to the Metropolitan Board of Works was, however, allowed to lapse on the 5th July, and the produce thereof, about £350,000 a year, has been replaced by the rates. This sum represents an addition of nearly 3d. in the pound to the metropolitan ratepayer, and the price of coal has considerably advanced since the abolition of the duty. INHABITED HOUSE DUTY. The Yestry again communicated with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the month of April respecting the anomalies incident to the levying of the Inhabited House Duty, to which reference has been made in previous Reports, but without result. Taking advantage of the prospective surplus which it was commonly believed would be available for the readjustment of taxation, the Yestry once more addressed the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the subject early in March, 1890, but the Budget speech had not been delivered at Lady-day. VESTRY PROPERTY. Vestry Hall.—The Vestry Hall and offices were cleaned and some small painting work was carried out, during the summer recess, at a cost of £49. Stables and Stoneyard.—No works of importance have been required during the year. Disinfector.—The Disinfector has been used for disinfecting bedding, clothing, &c., for parishioners on 51 occasions, compared with 42 in 1888-9, and 81 in 1887-8. 40 Mortuary.—The bodies of 34 persons have been received into the Mortuary during the year, as compared with 30 during the previous twelve months. Medical men, the clergy, district visitors, and others who are specially brought into contact with the poor, are invited to assist the Vestry in preventing the spread of disease which may arise from the retention of a corpse in a room occupied perhaps by a number of people in a thickly-populated neighbourhood, by making known, as occasion requires, the provision made for the reception of bodies in a decent manner, and with all possible deference to the natural feelings of the bereaved relatives. As the main object of providing a Mortuary and Disinfectant Apparatus is to protect the parishioners at large against the spread of infectious disease, either may be used without charge. Information as to the mode of proceeding in such a case may be freely obtained at the Vestry Hall. OTHER PARISH PROPERTY. Eleven freehold houses on the east side of Marshall Street Avere purchased in the year 1819, for Parochial purposes. Two of the houses are now absorbed into the Workhouse premises, and the site of three others has been utilized for the erection of the Public Baths and Wash-houses." The remaining six houses are let; four of them on repairing agreements, and two on short tenancies in anticipation of their being required almost immediately for purposes of repair, or for an extension of the Public Baths. The rent received for these six houses, together with the sum receivable from the Westminster Union in respect of that portion of the Workhouse premises belonging to the Parish of St. James, is applied in aid of the Poor Rate. 41 SCAVENGING, DUST, REMOVAL, &c. Under the system adopted by the Vestry, the roadsweepers are employed and paid by the Vestry, but the collection and removal of house dust, street refuse, &c., are done under contract. The total cost of scavenging and dust removal for the past year, as given in the Accounts, was £6,325 16s. 6d., compared with £6,292 6s. 7d. for the previous year. The wages of the street-sweepers have been increased from 3s. to 3s. 2d. per day of nine working hours; the gangers from 3s. 4d. to 3s. 6d., and the foreman from 30s. to 32s. per week. Overtime is paid for extra. The following is a statement of the number of loads reported to have been removed from the parish during the year:— Cart Loads. Wagon Loads. Dust 1,399 6,365 Slop 460 4,912 The cost of Street Watering last year was £947 4s. 4d., or £162 15s. 5d. more than in 1888-9. REMOVAL OF SNOW. In anticipation of a possible heavy snowfall, the Vestry early in the winter sought and obtained permission from the Thames Conservators and the London County Council, to cast clean snow over the parapet of the Victoria Embankment into the river. Fortunately, however, the Vestry have not had occasion to avail themselves of this permission. 42 CONTRACTS FOR WORKS AND MATERIALS. Particulars of the various contracts entered into or continued during the year are given on page 149. STREET LIGHTING. On the 25th March, 1889, there were 807 public lamps in the various thoroughfares of the Parish, 773 of which were ordinary street lamps (452 burning cannel gas, and 321 burning common gas), 4 were urinal lamps, and 30 were larger lamps attached to refuges. On the 25th March, 1890, the number of lamps was 818, showing an increase of 11 in the 12 months; the proportion of different lamps is now 459 cannel gas street lamps, 324 common gas street lamps, 4 urinal lamps, and 31 refuge lamps. Until quite recently, the ordinary street lamps were lighted, extinguished, cleaned, and maintained by the Gas Company under an arrangement with the Vestry ; the agreed sum for last year was £3 per annum for each lamp burning cannel gas, and £3 0s. 8d. for each lamp burning common gas. The light given is practically identical, 4ft. of cannel gas being supplied per lamp per hour, and 5ft. of common gas. As regards the refuge lamps, payment is made according to the consumption of gas as registered by meter. The total cost of street lighting for the past year amounted to £2,707 0s. 11d., as compared with £2,559 5s. 8d. for the previous twelve months. This sum is exclusive of new lamp-posts, lanterns and fittings, which cost a further sum of £1,184 10s. 7d. The increase in the cost of street lighting is due partly to the larger consumption of gas per lamp, which was 43 duced in the year 1888-9. but the full effect of which was not manifested in the accounts for that year, as the increased consumption was not adopted until after the year had commenced, and partly to the erection of a few additional lamps. The extra cost of new lamp-posts, lanterns, and fittings, as compared with the previous year, is principally due to the purchase of new and improved lanterns for almost all the street lanterns in the Parish, as mentioned in last year's Report. In consequence of the alteration in the description of street lanterns, it became necessary to alter the arrangements which had hitherto been adopted for the maintenance of the lanterns, lamp-posts, &c. The Gas Company had for many years contracted to keep the street lanterns in repair, paint the lamp-posts annually, and repair or replace them, when broken, at an inclusive charge of 3s. per lamp per annum. When the new lanterns were fixed, tenders were invited for their maintenance, the painting of the lamp-posts, &c., from a few firms, and the tender of Messrs. S. Pontifex & Co. was accepted at the following rates. The arrangement is terminable on the 25th December in any year, on one month's previous notice:— Per annum. 16in. lantern and column 3/9 14in. „ „ 3/6 16in. „ and bracket 3/9 14in. ,, „ 3/6 “Metropole” lanterns, and bracket or column 3/9 Refuge lanterns and column 15/- Metropolitan Board pattern lantern and column 6/6 For the guidance of strangers, street-name tablets have been fitted in all street lanterns at the intersection of streets. 44 PRIVATE LAMPS. The Vestry some years since decided not to permit the erection of Private Lamps, except upon the following conditions:— 1. That no part of such Lamps shall be less than 10 feet in height from the public footway. 2. That no such Lamps shall in any case project further than the inside of the kerb bounding the footway. 3. That all such Lamps shall be entirely free from writing or any trade devices, except in such cases as Medical Men, Post Offices, Sweeps, Fire Engines, or other positions where they would be a public guide in cases of emergency 4. That no such Lamps shall be suspended by ball and socket- joint only. 5. That no Lamps on posts be agreed to unless they are kept lighted the whole night. 6. That a sketch of the proposed Lamps with their dimensions and of any intended inscription thereon, be submitted with the application to the Vestry for approval. These regulations have been under consideration during the year, but no alteration was made therein. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. The most important event of the year in connection with the subject of Electric Lighting was unquestionably the Inquiry held at the Westminster Town Hall, by Major Marindin on behalf of the Board of Trade, assisted by Captain (now Major) Cardew. In order to make the object of this Inquiry as clear as possible, it may, perhaps, be desirable to trace briefly the origin and purpose of the legislation relating to Electric Lighting. It is a fact frequently overlooked that the main object of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, was to authorise the 45 turbance of streets for the purpose of enabling Companies or Persons purveying electricity to lay mains and otherwise carry on their operations. No one has a right to break up a public street without statutory authority, and even the consent of the local authority will not prevent an indictment for an unauthorised disturbance of the soil of a street. Hence the necessity for legislation to authorise the operations of Electric Lighting Companies so far as laying underground mains is concerned. Wires may be carried overhead if the •consent of the owners of the property over which they pass (not only to which they are attached) is obtained. In the case of the Wandsworth District Board v. United Telephone Company, the Court of Appeal, in 1884, held that the road authorities have no property in the space above the streets, so it would appear that, unless the wires are dangerous or interfere with the use of a street as a street, the local authority have no power to prevent wires being stretched across a street, or to enforce the removal of such wires. When the Electric Lighting Act was passed in 1882, however, the Government evidently held the opinion that local authorities did possess such a power, and no power was taken to prevent the erection of overhead wires, although by section 14 of the Act it was expressly enacted that no power was thereby conferred for placing any wire “along, over, or across any street without the express consent of the local authority.” The main object of the Electric Lighting Acts may therefore be said to be to confer upon persons authorised to supply electricity power to lay mains underground. This power may be obtained in either one of two ways, viz. (1) a licence, or (2) a provisional order. A licence may be granted by the Board of Trade for any period not exceeding seven years, and is renewable from time 46 to time, but a licence cannot be granted unless the local authority (in the Metropolis the Vestry or District Board of Works) has first given its consent. A licence is operative directly it has been granted by the Board of Trade. A Provisional Order is likewise granted by the Board of Trade, but the period may be unlimited. The consent of the local authority is, under the Act of .1888, also required to the grant of a Provisional Order, subject, however, to the Board of Trade deciding (if consent is withheld) that there are special circumstances in any particular case rendering such consent unnecessary. A Provisional Order is not operative until it has been confirmed by Parliament. It is, in fact, a private Act of Parliament, but has the advantage over ordinary private legislation of having been considered by a Governmental Department advised by experts before being submitted to Parliament. Within six months after the expiration of 42 years from the date of the passing of the Act confirming the Order, or after the expiration of any subsequent period of ten years, the local authority may, upon notice, acquire the undertaking within their jurisdiction on payment of the then value of the property, without any addition for compulsory purchase, goodwill, or prospective profit. The Electric Lighting Acts do not prevent a Company obtaining a special private Act of Parliament, as they might have done before the passing of the Acts, but they regulate the principles upon which such special legislation is to proceed, and practically require the special Act to be framed in the same form, mutatis mutandis, as a Provisional Order. Applicants for Provisional Orders, or for private Bills, are required to give notice to the Vestry or District Board, in 47 the months of November or December, of their intended application, but applications for a licence may be made at any time. In the autumn and winter of 1888 the Vestry received four applications for licences, notice of one intended application for a private Act, and notices of two intended applications for a Provisional Order. The Vestry had already consented to a licence being granted to the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Lighting Company, and a Provisional Order to the South Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, on certain conditions which had formed the subject of protracted conferences at the offices of the Board of Trade. Both licence and Provisional Order were granted by the Board of Trade, but the latter, on being submitted to Parliament at a late period of the Session, for confirmation, met with unexpected opposition, and failed to receive confirmation, thus becominginoperative. The promoters of this abortive order then applied for a licence, to which the Vestry at once assented, but as many applications for licences, some embracing very extensive areas of supply, had been received, the Board of Trade declined to take the responsibility of deciding, without appeal to Parliament, the questions of principle involved, and so refused a licence. The promoters then gave notice of their intention to apply for a private Act, and the Vestry decided to support this application if the terms of the Bill were identical with the Provisional Order to which they had already assented. Such was the position of affairs in St. James's, when the Vestry were called upon to consider applications from other undertakers. Shortly the policy adopted by the Vestry was 48 this; the London Electric Supply Corporation were already supplying ratepayers, outside the Act, by means of an objectionable system of overhead wires, and although the Vestry would prefer to be left alone with the two Companies who had already assented to their terms, they would not have opposed the granting of an order to the London Electric Supply Corporation, subject to the Board of Trade being satisfied Avith the stability of the Company, and the safety, economy, &c., of their proposed system of supply, provided the Company would come under similar conditions to those imposed on their competitors in the Parish. The other applications the Vestry absolutely declined to entertain. Taking the Metropolis as a whole, the interests involved, both as to capital and the interests of the public, were so enormous that the Board of Trade directed an inquiry to be held, at which all Companies, authorities, and persons interested could be heard before any farther licences or provisional orders were granted. The Inquiry was conducted by Major Marindin, R.E., assisted by Captain Cardew. It was held at the Westminster Town Hall, commenced on the 3rd April, and occupied 18 days. Its scope embraced all the applications then pending for licences or provisional orders in any part of the Metropolis. These applications presented almost every phase of the question of electrical supply, including questions between high and low tension, continuous and alternating currents, the use of converters and the use of accumulators, large and small areas of supply, local generating stations and one large station, and various other questions of detail. It will thus be seen that the Inquiry was of an exhaustive nature, and is likely to mark an era in the history of the supply of electricity in the Metropolis. 49 On the opening of the Inquiry, the Parish of St. James was, concerned in only two competing Companies:—The London Electric Supply Corporation, and the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company; the Westminster Electric Supply Corporation withdrew St. James's from their proposed area of supply the St. James's and Pall Mall Company were already established under a licence, and the applications by other Companies for licences could not proceed because the Vestry withheld their consent. The Vestry had already agreed terms with the Metropolitan Company (formerly the South Metropolitan Company), so that beyond watching the proceedings with regard to that Company, in order to see that the advantages gained by negotiation and embodied in their draft Bill were not lost, there only remained to consider the attitude which the London Electric Supply Corporation would adopt at the Inquiry, for up to that time they had not in terms assented to a single amendment suggested by the Vestry, On the Inquiry being opened, Mr. Pember, the counsel lor the Company, adopted the Vestry's objections as typical of most of the objections of the local authorities generally, and treated them in a somewhat hostile spirit. Lord Crawford, Chairman of the Company, in his evidence, declined to entertain one of the most important of these objections, that relating to overhead wires, saying, in effect, that although willing that the Order should not authorize overhead wires— which the law itself enacts—he intended to rely upon his "common law rights" to suspend wires overhead, if he required them, and that he absolutely declined to come under any obligation to remove existing wires, although he stated, at a later period, that he would prefer to lay his mains underground as a general practice. D 50 The position thus taken up by the London Companyrendered it impossible for the Vestry to adopt any other course than to oppose the application for an Order. The Vestry had indeed not consented to the application, but in view of what may be called the historic character of the Inquiry, it seemed only right that the Vestry should not merely adopt a negative position, but should place their views on record. The Vestry were represented at the Inquiry by the Vestry Clerk, who cross-examined such of the witnesses as gave evidence bearing upon the questions at issue, and subsequently addressed the Inspector in support of the views of the Vestry. It is not necessary to reproduce here either the evidence, or the remarks of the Vestry Clerk in full, but perhaps the following extracts from the remarks may prove of interest as indicating the policy of the Vestry The first question, dealing with the strict question of policy, is whether we should adopt a system of free trade or of districting Companies. I think, before deciding upon that question, we must have some regard to the area of St. James's. We have a very compact area; we embrace various classes of property; we have large clubs, large business houses, mansions of the nobility and gentry, all of which might be expected to be large consumers of the current. But we have also other kinds of property in what we might call the back part of the parish. We have other kinds of property in which the supply of electricity for lighting purposes at anything approaching its present price will simply be impossible. But that district is largely dotted about by small manufactories We were advised, at a very early stage of this electric lighting inquiry, using that in its widest sense, going back to the year 1882, that the circumstances of our parish were somewhat exceptionally favourable for the adoption of electricity, partly on account of the steadiness with which the current would be required for light in the southern part of the parish, and partly also because (supposing the same current to be applied) when the current 51 was not used in the southern part of the parish for light, a large portion of the resulting loss of mechanical power would be saved by the application of this same current to power. Very well, Sir, such being the condition of affairs in St. James's, allow me briefly to speak of the question of free trade versus monopoly, or qualified monopoly The Vestry have adopted, on very common sense grounds, I think, the principle that districting is as essential in the case of electric lighting as it ever was in the case of gas, and, in fact, is more so—and for one or two very practical reasons. In the first place the ground is now occupied by mains. There were at one time no less than fifteen Companies having authority to lay mains along Regent Street. Many of those mains have become absolutely useless and dead; but they represent a very important factor to the consumers, inasmuch as they were provided by capital upon which dividends are now being paid. That is a question of course of political economy; but it is a very practical phase of the question indeed, and has an exceptional bearing in this case, in this way, that when the standard was fixed, I think it was in the year 1871, in consequence of the useless expenditure of capital north of the Thames, the standard or initial price was fixed at 3s. 9d., as compared with an initial or standard price of 3s. 6d. south of the Thames; and I think, Sir, if you enquire into the reason of this waste of expenditure, you will find that it was largely due to the mistaken policy of free trade in gas in the early stages. Then another point is that during the Free Trade competition in gas, whether it was a friendly competition or otherwise I do not stop to inquire, there was a continual tearing up of streets and interruption of traffic, which was exceedingly objectionable at that time, but would be additionally objectionable now in consequence of the continually increasing traffic in the central parts of London. It may be said, of course, that the circumstances of electricity, of Electric Lighting Companies are somewhat different to the condition of the Gas Companies when the districting took place. But I am not at all sure that the difference is worth considering Of course, if the competition were equal, supposing the Companies supplied, each of them, their 50 per cent. of the current from the main, no doubt competition would then be operative; but supposing D 2 52 we take it that there is a powerful Company supplying 90 per cent. or 89 per cent. of current—80 per cent. of the possible current —or the current for which the main was laid, and the other simply supplying 10 per cent. or 20 per cent., the condition of competition then would be absolutely unfair and unequal. Then, of course, there is another objection to which I have already briefly referred, and it is this, that now the space in the streets is absolutely—well almost entirely—filled. There are at the present time, I am informed by the Gas Company, no less than six mains along Piccadilly, which has a width of something like 39 feet in its narrowest part, and those mains are actually charged with gas, in addition to the dead mains of whose existence the Gas Company have no knowledge; so that if the principle of competition were admitted we find that actual competition—not merely potential competition—(because that is not sufficient), but effective competition, would be physically impossible, because there would be no room to lay more mains than for one or two Companies at the most. So that we have arrived at this conclusion: that in theory it would be wise to apportion London between different Companies. We would district London; but we are placed in this condition at the outset. Are we in a position yet to say that any system of electric light is applicable to any particular area? The battle of alternating and continuous currents, of course, has been fought out here, and will have to be fought out in actual practice. The conclusion arrived at by the Vestry is this: That while in theory they say that the wisest course to pursue, both to the consumer at the present time, to the shareholders at the present time, and also to the local authorities, in the eventuality of their acquiring the undertaking at the end of the 42 years—we say that we have not yet arrived at a stage at which one can say that a certain Company is the best for a certain district of London, and a certain other Company is best for another district Are we out of the experimental stage? I think, Sir, the evidence of Mr. Ferranti will show you that practically the whole system of the London Electric Supply Corporation is experimental. We are to have a dynamo constructed very much larger than any dynamo that has ever yet been erected. We are to use the concentric main, and not the concentric main only but the rigid concentric main. This 53 concentric main will be jointed at every 20 yards, and it is admitted that at every 20 yards there will be a weakest point of the system. We have in addition to that a potential of 10,000 volts which has never yet been attempted except (if at all) on a small scale. Here the experiment is to be made on a main extending for a distance of something like 7 or 8 miles. We have then, Sir, the system of double conversion— conversion at the distributing stations, and again on the consumers' premises, which is to some extent also an experiment. And the question arises whether it is wise to entrust this Company with so large an area to make their gigantic experiment upon The Vestry have adopted two competing Companies. They are competing in almost every sense of the word. The St. James's Company is using the continuous current at low tension; the only work which the Metropolitan are doing in St. James's is being done at a moderately high tension on the alternating system. So that the current is competitive and the management of the Company is also competitive, for while the St. James's Company is restricted to the parish of St. James, the Metropolitan Company has a very much wider area. The area under the licence as agreed, or the Provisional Order rather, as agreed last year, simply includes the parish of St. Martin's, but still it was a larger area, considerably more than double the area of the St. James's Company. We then have adopted a middle course. We have neither gone in for free trade nor have we gone in for districting, because for the reasons stated, while we agree with the districting we do not think the time has yet arrived when a fair scheme of districting can be laid down. But we have taken a proviso from both these Companies, and this really was the stumbling block which nearly brought both Companies to grief—nearly broke off negociations that is to say—that the Vestry require that a condition should be inserted to provide not merely potential but an effective competition. Potential competition is only useful up to a point. Potential competition is all very well if the two people are on equal terms. But we wanted the competition to be effective, and the way we have provided for it, I think, will prove satisfactory. But, of course, experience only will show that. The way we have provided for that is to insert a clause in the licence or Provisional Order binding the undertakers not to associate with 54 any other Company or person either supplying or intending to supply electricity within the parish. That clause formed the subject, I think, of three interviews with the Board of Trade last year, and so the whole circumstance would be quite familiar to you. We have adopted this view deliberately. We say that until we are in a position to district London, let us have competition—let us have limited competition—let us have effective competition, because we believe that effective competition will help us to solve the difficulty of districting at a more early date than either free trade or districting at the present time. And after all, those clauses prohibiting the association of competing Companies, preventing practically a working arrangement to defeat the purposes of competition, is not much more than an extension of the 11th section of the Electric Lighting Act of 1882. The latter part of that section, Sir, is that "no local authority, Company, or person, shall by any contract or assignment transfer to any other Company or person or divest themselves of any legal powers given to them, or any legal liabilities imposed upon them by this Act, or by any licence, order, or special Act without the consent of the Board of Trade." We go a step further and say that the Companies shall not only not do that, but that they shall not make a working arrangement which would defeat the purpose and object we have in introducing limited competition. The Vestry are the best judges, I think, of local requirements. I have nothing to say against the Board of Trade being the authority to say whether the working arrangements shall or shall not be permitted, but inasmuch as the Vestry are the statutory local authority, and, as I submit most respectfully, they have a better local knowledge, I think the solution which has been adopted is the best one Now, I should like just to say a word or two with regard to the principles affected with regard to the Order and to the Bill. The Vestry have not taken an extreme view. They have laid down a principle that an electric lighting undertaking, like any other undertaking that appeals to the public for support, must largely depend for its success upon commercial principles. That view has been steadily kept in mind throughout the negotiations both with the Metropolitan Company and with the St. James's Company. Of course we have the experience to Some extent of the working of the Gasworks Clauses Acts and of the special Acts of the 55 Gas Companies, and we are aware that they have very great power of taking security from would-be consumers of gas, and as a matter of fact in some parts of the parish where the change of tenancy is frequent that power is very largely acted upon within my own knowledge. The great bulk of the parish is quite free from the operation of that particular legislation, and we assume that while it is right for the Electric Lighting Companies to be protected from bad debts, inasmuch as they cannot decline to serve on ordinary terms of trade, we are quite content to believe that the Electric Lighting Companies will be so far alive to their own interests as to largely abandon those precautions which are given to them as safeguards. We have never insisted upon an impossibility. We have never asked the Companies to lay a main in every street, for instance, and we have even abandoned the idea of Schedule A and Schedule B with regard to the Metropolitan Company. We have abandoned the idea which, in 1883, found favour with Mr. Moulton, among others, of specifying streets for the laying of mains in a select area, and we are quite willing that the whole area should depend upon its requirements for the supply of electricity. . . Up to last autumn the Yestry had voluntarily selected two Companies, the St. James's and the Metropolitan, to supply their parish; but matters were considerably complicated by the receipt of notices from several other Companies, among them the London. These, five in all, were very carefully considered, and the line adopted by the Vestry was this: We prefer to be left to two Companies, but we acknowledge that the London Company are supplying something over —I do not know the exact number— but something over 100 of our parishioners and our ratepayers, and those 100 ratepayers are entitled to consideration. If we reject the London Company altogether, our 100 parishioners may suffer temporary inconvenience, until they are able to draw their supply of light from the authorized Companies. But we say this : that we are not prepared to assent to the London Company coming in upon any terms they please. If they will adopt the amendments that have formed the subject of protracted negotiations with the Board of Trade, and which have proved acceptable to two other Companies, we will assent to their Order, but on no other terms. With regard to the other applicants (the House to House Company for a licence, the Westminster for a Provisional 56 Order, and, I think, there was another one), the Yestry merely said this: there is a distinction between a Company which is already supplying light in the parish, although outside the statute, and the Companies which neither have works nor customers in the parish, and therefore we will have nothing to do with you, you may go to the Board of Trade, and if the Board of Trade think in their wisdom that you are entitled to Orders or licences to supply electricity to the parishioners, by all means let them grant the Order or licence, and upon them shall rest the responsibility. The Vestry will not assent, or be a party in any way, to any Company coming in beyond those I have indicated. But, Sir, what took place? Those views were communicated to the solicitors to the London Company, and there was not even an acknowledgement of the objections. Consequently, we were left in the dark until we received a circular which, in a very light manner indeed, dealt with objections which, to us, seemed to be striking at matters of principle. And our principal reason for objecting to the London Electric Company coming in upon their own terms, apart from the question of experiment, upon which I shall offer some slight evidence, is that we say that competition to be competition must be based upon equal terms. We have got here the London Electric Supply Corporation in possession of part of the area. If they will come under the same terms as their competitors, by all means let them come in (assuming that their stability is established, and their system approved), having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, but if you give them more favourable terms than Companies who are working inside the statute, you will actually put a premium upon people obtaining a footing in the parish by some means certainly never contemplated by law. For instance, how has the London Company obtained its footing ? By means of overhead wires, as far as St. James's is concerned, and by means of unauthorized pipes under streets so far as some of the other parishes are concerned, among others Chelsea. Now, Sir, upon the question of overhead wires, I should like to refer you to the questions which were asked by Sir Henry Tyler of Mr. Gladstone, and of the Attorney-General, in the year 1881 That was the year before the Electric Lighting Act was passed I think I have got the dates here. The Attorney-General's answer is reported in the "Times" of the 9th July, 1881, and I 57 think Mr. Gladstone's vras something like three or four weeksearlier. Both Mr. Gladstone and the Attorney-General, whose name I forget, paid that the local authority had power to prevent overhead wires; that was in 1881. Mr. Graham (Counfel for the Company): Are you going to call these gentlemen? Mr. Wilkins: No, I do not propose to do so. Now, Sir, we come to the next year 1882, when the Board of Trade promoted an Electric Lighting Bill. Here is the report of the Select Committee issued by the authority of Parliament. Mr Farrer, the then Secretary of the Board of Trade, gave evidence I do not propose to read the whole of his evidence, but just to select part. Question 256 is a question asked by the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Edward Stanhope. Mr. Stanhope asks Mr. Farrer, as he then was, "I did not quite understand what you said with regard to the special powers to carry wires overhead-; that is a matter which involves some discussion. Now, as to telegraph wires, there is no provision in the Bill." Mr. Farrer says, "There seems to be an opinion that it is a doubtful and dangerous practice; no provision is inserted in the Bill enabling it to be done at all; if it is done at all it mutt be done by consent." That was Mr. Farrer's opinion—the opinion of the Board of Trade, that is to say. "There would be nothing to prohibit it?—There would be nothing to prohibit any local authority from doing it, if they have the powers already." That is, the local authority might erect wires if they had the power. "I believe the scientific people say that protection can be given against accidents, still keeping the wires overhead, by placing them in a certain position." Mr. Farrer says: "We understand from the Electric Lighting Bill Promoters that they would never wish to put them overhead; that they would very much prefer to lay them under the kerbstone; that they take up very little space, and can be laid much more readily. Therefore, there is no power taken to place them overhead, and that could only hedone, probably, by the consent of the owner and under the consent of the local authority. (Q.) How is it done now, by the telegraph?—Under the Telegraph Act of 1863, I think. If it is desirable that they should not be put overhead, and if the electric lighting people co not want them overhead, there could be no 58 objection to a clause prohibiting it." Sir Frederick Bramwell, and all the scientific witnesses, gave evidence saying that they did not want them overhead, and in the case of Dundee, Mr. Leng, who was seeking powers there—he was Chairman of the Northern Electric Light Company—was asked as to the practice in Dundee. "(Q.) How do you get across the street ?—At present by overhead wires. (Q.) Is there anything to prevent your having overhead wires ?—The local authority could at once prevent us. (Q.) Do you think it right that they should?—I think that overhead wires, if multiplied, would come to be very objectionable. (Q.) Even if carried along the roofs of the houses, as they are in London?—I think if you had a large number of them they would be datigerous." Now, Sir, what does the section in the Act say with regard to overhead wires? "Notwithstanding anything in this Act, or in any Act incorporated therewith, the undertakers shall not be authorized to place any electric line above ground, along, over, or across any street without the express consent of the local authority," and so on. I contend, Sir, that having in view the replies given by Mr. Gladstone, and by his Attorney-General, and the evidence given by Mr. Farrer, the Secretary to the Board of Trade, that it was then the opinion of the Government —and they allowed the legislature to form the same opinion— that the erection of overhead wires was absolutely illegal without consent. But since this Act was passed, the question has been contested. There was an action brought by the Wandsworth District Board against the Postmaster-General, and an action brought also against the United Telephone Company. There was no question at all about the power of the Wandsworth District Board to control the wires of the Post Office, because they come under the Telegraph Act of 1863, and the legislation effecting the transfer from the Companies to the Government. But the United Telephone Company's case went to Appeal, and the Master of the Rolls in giving judgment said, "I am of opinion that this Act of Parliament (18 and 19 Vic., cap 120, sec. 96), by the use of the word 'street' does not pass any property over the street; it only passes property in the street. It therefore passes only that which is the ordinary space occupied by men or things which use the street as a street. Under those circumstances it appears to me that no property passes in 59 that part of the air through which or in which these telegraph wires were placed." So then it is evident that the Government in 1882 were mistaken in their views of the power possessed by local authorities to prevent the erection of overhead wires, and you will see, Sir, that the London Electric Supply Corporation, in adopting a general system of overhead wires, have adopted a system which, if not expressly prohibited by legislation, certainly was not contemplated by the legislature when the Electric Lighting Act of 1882 was passed. Then the two or three points which the Yestry wished the London Electric Supply Corporation particularly to meet them upon were, firstly, those to which the other Companies had already assented, after, as I have said, protracted negotiations; and, secondly, to give us some prospect of seeing those wires which disfigure some of our leading streets disappear from view within a limited period. But in consequence of the Company adopting what I may describe as a non possumus attitude, we were unable to enter into negotiations upon clauses, and therefore we are forced into opposing them upon the merits of the Order. The fourth objection I was going to refer to is the financial objection. The Promoters say, by this grand scheme of a station away from London, at Deptford, they will save something like 50 per cent. in the cost of production, and that that economy of 50 per cent. is to be gained at an outlay of only 7 per cent.; so you see, Sir, according to their showing, there is a net saving in the cost of production of 43 per cent. Now, Sir, how is that economy disposed of? Well, one would think the consumers at any rate would have part of the benefit, but, on referring to the Order, I find that the London Company seek power to charge 8d. per unit, or at that rate, that is 6s. 8d. for 10 Board of Trade units, a price equivalent to 8d. per Board of Trade unit,* whereas they are now only charging 7¼d., and the maximum of the two Companies who assented to our terms is only 7d. Now, * A Board of Trade unit is the energy contained in a current of 1,000 amperes flowing under an electro-motive force of one volt during one hour. To compare the price of the electric light on this basis with the price of gas, light for light, a unit may be taken as equivalent to 100 feet of common gas. 60 Sir, is it unreasonable to say that if these people can work so much more economically than a local station, their maximum should be at least limited to that of the local station, namely, 7d. Upon the question of economy, I propose to call a technical witness But, Sir, I think possibly my principal objection to the London Company's scheme is that it is a huge experiment, as I have told you. It is an experiment from first to last; it is an experiment as far as the dynamo is concerned, it is an experiment as far as the distance is concerned, it is an experiment as far as the concentric main is corcerned, it is an experiment as far as the rigidity of main is concerned, it is an experiment as far as insulation is concerned, it is an experiment as far as the double conversion is concerned. I do not say that these Problems have not been satisfactorily solved on a small scale, they have more or less, possibly; and possibly you may reason that because you can fit up a dynamo to supply a certain number of lights therefore it is a mere matter of mechanical calculation to construct a dynamo on a larger scale; but still, Sir, to that extent it is a huge experiment, and the Vestry of St. James's would very much prefer that the experiment should be kept out of their area rather than that they should be experimented upon. I have dealt rather at some length with these objections—rather at greater length than I intended—because I am anxious to show you, and the representatives of the London Company, that these objections have not been taken lightly. They really formed the subject of mature deliberations on the part of the Vestry, after an experience of a considerable number of years; and we say that we have made arrangements with the two Companies which we believe will secure us the maximum amount of convenience, and the minimum amount of waste. Some amount of waste we admit there will be, by having two Companies at work in the same area, but our arrangements will give us, we think, the most effective competition with the minimum of waste. But this competition being effective, something more than potential, being actually operative, will enable us to satisfactorily solve the question of districting at an earlrer period than would otherwise have been the case. We say we would much rather be without the London Company, but if the London Company get their 61 Order and include in their Order the Parish of St. James, we do pay that the competition, to be even friendly competition, should be based upon the same terms which have been accepted by their competitors, because competition on unequal terms ceases o be competition, and certainly ceases to be friendly competition on both sides. There is another objection which possibly may have some weight with you, Sir, and it is this—that speaking from the point of view of a local authority, if we have got three Companies supplying electricity in the Parish, and the three Companies are working under two different forms of Orders with two different kinds of obligation, it will cause an immense amount of inconvenience, both to the local authority and to the consumer; and I think, Sir, that that point is one that I ought to urge with some strength. I trust you will appreciate it at what I consider its proper value. I do not know that I need trouble you with any further remarks, but I have thought it right to speak at some length upon the policy of the Vestry, because as Mr. Loyd says, the compliment was paid to the St. James's Vestry of taking their objections as typical of the whole Metropolis, and I was anxious that it should be seen that the objections were not lightly taken, but that we had good ground for every one that we did take. I have every confidence, of course, in leaving it to the decision of the Board of Trade, and to Parliament, in their wisdom to settle as best they see fit. A copy of the Report of Major Marindin upon the various applications for Provisional Orders and Licences which formed the subject of the Inquiry was received by the Yestry on the 20th May. The following extracts convey the salient points of the Report:— The relative advantages and disadvantages of the high pressure Transformer system and of the direct system as used by the Chelsea Company are thus concisely stated by Major Cardew, who bases his remarks upon the evidence given at the inquiry:— "The Transformer system carries the high pressure up to the houses. The distributing mains, therefore, are of small size. A large district can be served from one station, and the regulation of pressure in the distributing mains can be very good. There should he no great difficulty in 62 taining a standard pressure within a variation of 2 per cent. The pressure in the houses may be different in different cases, according to the needs or fancy of the consumer. „ It is also a simple system to work, and the dynamos are simple, and can be made in easily replaceable parts. „ On the other hand the high pressure necessitates great care and expense in insulation; the conveying of this high pressure to, at any rate, one point on the consumer's premises, and the risk of a contact between this circuit and the low-pressure circuit inside the house, involves some risk to life, although it may be reduced to a minimum by proper regulations and precautions; the main cannot be handled or connexions made when the pressure is on; the regulation in the houses is not so good as in the mains, as the Transformers act as a considerable added resistance, and cause an increased variation of pressure in the power as compared with that in the mains; the system cannot at present be efficiently utilized for motive power, or for flectric deposition or other chemical uses, such as charging accumulators; and it is very doubtful whether a practically successful alternating motor is likely to be brought out; the system depends entirely on running machinery, and engines and dynamos have to be kept in motion throughout the 24 hours; the general efficiency must be low when the supply is near its minimum, a condition which, so long as it is utilised for lighting alone, obtains during about 18 hours of every day on the average, and a serious accident in the generating station might stop the supply for a considerable time. Alternating machines cannot be so readily connected together to run in parallel circuit as continuous current machines. The measurement of alternating current, pressure, and power also offers considerable difficulty, and the available instruments and methods are far more restricted in number than is the case with the corresponding quantities in continuous supply. "The Chelsea system has the advantage of high pressure between the generating and distributing stations, without its being brought into the consumer's premises, and the distributing stations may be so numerous that each one 63 serves only a small district, and in this way the size of distributing mains may be kept down ; the supply from batteries has these enormous advantages ; that in the event of a total breakdown at the generating station supply can still be maintained for some hours ; that it is not necessary to keep the machinery at the generating station in motion throughout the whole 24 hours, and that the batteries provide a supply for the long hours when very little is required; the system has the advantages of continuous currents, viz., applicability to the supply of motive power, and other uses besides light and heat, and greater ease of measurement. The regulation, with small areas supplied from each sub-station, should be very good, and there is no doubt that a battery current is less destructive to lamps than one supplied from dynamos, whether alternating or continuous. "On the other hand the cost of the batteries is very great, and also that of the skilled attention they require, while their efficiency at maximum out-put is probably rather low; the automatic switches are a weak point, and any failure in their action would probably ruin the batteries at that station; the insulation of large batteries cannot be maintained at all high, and the numerous joints, in the presence of acid fumes, are a source of weakness. "This system, in which the supply is entirely from accumulators, if it can be successfully worked in practice, possesses very great advantages. Unfortunately it cannot be forgotten that identically the same system was tried a few years ago at Colchester, and ended in disastrous failure." The principal objections which have been urged against the London Company's scheme specially are as follows:— (a) That having only one generating station an accident might stop the whole supply. That an accident, such as the bursting of one of the large steam pipes,, might have this effect is certain, for even if it did not kill or injure those in charge of the machines, it would fill the whole building with steam, which would greatly impede, if it did not entirely prevent, the necessary work of the station from being for 61 some minutes carried on, and would, I am advised, by condensing on the dynamos, switches, &c., working at very high pressure, possibly cause an electrical break down. The risk of such an accident, or any serious accident to the running machinery, might no doubt be provided against by a proper system of inspection and testing, and so far as the filling of the building with steam, and risk to life from the bursting of a steam pipe, is concerned, the ill-effects might be minimised by covering in the pipes; but the Result of any cessation of work for even a few minutes at a generating station, upon which the supply of a very large area is solely dependent, would be so serious that I consider that it will be necessary to reqaire that the Company shall, to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade, so sub-divide the station at Deptford as practically to provide two distinct generating stations; or shall forthwith establish a second generating station in some other locality. In either case there should be duplicate sets of mains led by different routes to each of the distributing stations in the area of supply. (b) That the great length of the trunk main increases the chance of a breakdown, and that the pattern of main proposed, with its numerous joints, is unsatisfactory. This is a question which, no doubt, merits the serious attention of the Board of Trade, but it is one which I have no reason to believe would not be satisfactorily dealt with by proper regulations. (c) That the proposed pressure of 10,000 volts is so enormously in excess of anything which has hitherto been worked with, that the scheme is a gigantic experiment. No doubt in a certain sense this is true, but it must not be forgotten that whereas a few years ago the pressure of some 200 volts was considered to be the limit of safety, this Company has for some time been working, eafely and successfully, at a pressure of more than 10 times this amount, and as the so-called experiment of still further raising the limit of pressure would, if successfully carried out, be of immense benefit both to the public and electric lighting undertakers, I do not consider that, under proper regulations. the London Company should be prevented from carrying out a scheme in which they have shown the greatest confidence, and which the majority of the scientific witnesses who have been called approve of in principle. 65 (d) That the telegraphic and telephonic service of the Metropolis will be seriously interfered with. This difficulty ought to be easily met by proper regulations and proper clauses in the order. On the other hand, the system of the London Company possesses the undoubted advantages over any others, which arise from the location of the generating station on the riverside, and the consequent removal from the crowded parts of the Metropolis of all inconvenience from noise, vibration, smoke, and heavy traffic. It will probably also be found that from the economy resulting from the concentration of plant, the facilities for getting a cheaper supply of coal, and the possession of large storage capacity upon the premises, the cost of production under the London system will be largely reduced, to the eventual benefit of the consumer. Of the scientific witnesses called as to the relative merits of the two systems of supply, the great majority were in favour of the alternating Transformer System for large areas. There can, however, be no doubt that from a consumer's point of view, leaving the question of price out of consideration, the supply made by such a Company as the Chelsea, viz., from accumulators alone, is the most valuable, and that the supply by means of all the direct systems has this advantage, that it can be utilized for power, which cannot at present, at any rate, be said of the supply given by the Transformer System. It would therefore be wisest, in my opinion, to give fair scope to all the proposed systems, all of which are capable of being worked; and it may be predicted with tolerable certainty that whatever system proves itself to be the best under all circumstances will eventually be adopted by all. Conclusions. After a careful consideration of the above points, and of all the evidence and arguments put before me, I have arrived at the following general conclusions:— (1.) That it must be admitted that the science of Electric Lighting has now reached the point at which a supply can be made which will be of very great benefit to the public, and that the power of obtaining this supply should be E 66 within the reach of all persons who may require it. For this reason it seems to me that, although the wishes and opinions of the local authorities in the areas proposed to be supplied should be consulted and deferred to, as far as possible, the mere objection by a local authority to the introduction of a Company proposing to supply Electric Light upon general grounds should not be considered sufficient to exclude such Company, unless the local authority should express its intention to undertake the supply, and give evidence that it proposes to apply for permission at do so, and this should apply with more force when it can be shown that the exclusion of a Company from such on area would injuriously affect the service of other contiguous areas. (2.) That in dealing with this question it should be considered as one affecting the interests of the metropolis as a whole, and as an area which at no very distant time may be for purposes of lighting and management of roads and streets under the control of one central authority; and that, therefore, the whole of the Provisional Orders granted for the Metropolitan area should, as far as possible, be identical in form, with identical provisions as to supply, compulsory powers, interference with streets, and more than all, as to price. In my opinion the Scheme, adopted in 1883, of dividing the area of supply into two areas (A.) and (B), would not be likely to work so much to the advantage of the public as the proposal in most of the Orders under consideration to make the supply compulsory under requisition over the whole area upon equal terms. I consider, however, that in order to insure that some work shall be at once undertaken in every parish or district within the area of supply under such Order, there should be a list of streets scheduled for compulsory laying of mains, and a deposic made in every case where the local authority may wish to have it. Where there are two Companies in the same area, different streets should be scheduled for each. With regard to the clauses affecting supply, interference with streets, testing, position of stations and distributing boxes, and other 67 details, the whole of the suggestions made by the local authorities should be carefully weighed, and those which are considered necessary embodied in the model form of Order. With regard to price, I do not consider that any one district in the Metropolis should be put in a better position than another. Taking the area as a whole, it does not appear that it would be wise to fix a lower maximum than 8d. per unit. It is true that the London Company is now supplying at 7¼d., and the maximum in the St. James and Pall Mall Company's licence is 7d., but these Companies are competing in an exceptionally good area. There would, however, appear to be a necessity for a reduction of the high rate for minimum supply, that is the sum which every customer taking a supply can be called upon to pay, irrespective of the amount which he has consumed, and which in the Orders varies between £3 6s. 8d. per quarter in the case of the Notting Hill Company, and £5 10s. in the case of the Metrrpolitan Company's South London Order. The latter Company has consented in the Mid-London and West London Orders to reduce the minimum to 13s. 4d. per quarter, and I consider that whatever minimum is fair should be adopted throughout. The provision for revision of price after each seven years, in the agreements between the Metropolitan Company and the Strand and Marylebone local authorities, seems to me to be somewhat contrary to the policy of Parliament when dealing with the Electric Lighting Act. If any such provision be inserted it should be general; and it would appear to be more fair that the revision should take the form of a sliding scale upon the basis of a 10 per cent. dividend, the standard being fixed after the experience gained by the working of the first seven years. It has been suggested that in the matter of price the consumer should, if he elects himself to pay the whole cost of connecting his house to the mains, have no minimum at all imposed upon him, but, although I can see no objection to this proposal, such a provision would hardly be necessary where the minimum is reduced as in the Metropolitan Orders. (3.) That in every case the supply of electricity, whether by a Company or by a local authority, should be under statutory E 2 68 obligations as well as statutory powers, by means of a Bill, a Provisional Order, or a licence. (4.) That there is no objection to the granting of a large area of supply to any Company which shows that it has sufficient capital, and is capable of coping with the demand. On the contrary, a large and rich Company is likely to be the best and most economically managed concern, to be able while working over a large and scattered area to develop the demand for the light, and by rapidly increasing its business to be the sooner in a position to reduce the price of the article supplied. (5.) That in the abstract, competition is desirable as tending to keep down the price, and to cause the manufacture and supply of electricity to be carried on with all the attention and energy which it is possible to devote to it. The competition with gas, which at present at any rate, and probably for many years to come, will appeal to a totally different class of customer, will not be nearly so effective, while the potential competition from the power of calling in a new Company in an area badly served is not likely to be called into play until the bad service has passed through many degrees, and has reached a very low ebb indeed. The question as to how many Companies should be granted concurrent powers in one area requires more consideration. In cases where the local authority objects to the entrance of any Company, and it is decided to over-rule the objection, I think that one Company only should be granted powers. In cases where two or more Companies have obtained the assent of the local authority, the following facts must not be lost sight of:— 1st. That the laying of the mains of several Companies up one street means so much dead capital, and moreover the provision of a certain amount of useless material, which the local authority would have to pay for if it should decide to purchase the undertakings after the lapse of 42 years. 2nd. That, no matter what regulations or stipulations may be made as to the laying of mains, the interference with the streets, and the consequent inconvenience to the public, must be in a certain degree proportionate to the number of Companies having powers over these streets. 69 For those reasons I am of opinion that, for the present, powers should not be given to more than two Companies over the same area, and, inasmuch as the Companies supplying under the. alternating current and transformer system cannot supply electric energy capable of use for motors, that both these two Companies should not be those using this system. In order, therefore, to leave room for the entrance of a direct supply Company into an area where two alternating current transformer Companies have been assented to, it will be necessary to choose one only of these Companies, and this will lead to a certain amount of districting. (6.) That wherever a Company now supplying a district by means of overhead wires is granted an Order for such area, it should be placed under the obligation to remove these overhead wires within a period of two years from the granting of the Order; and, if such a thing be possible, that this Company should be prevented from invading a district in which it has not got powers by means of overhead wires. (7.) That in order to reduce as much as possible the disturbance of streets, clauses should be drafted making it obligatory for Companies to lay their mains in existing subways, and to transfer them into subways which may be made in the future, upon being called upon to do so. If possible it would also be advisable to provide that, wherever circumstances admit of it, and where there is no subway, the conduits put down to lay the mains should be made capable of accommodating the mains of both Companies in the area, if there be two Companies having powers therein. To a certain extent also it would appear to be right that the local authorities should have the power of objecting to the sites for generating, as distinguished from distributing stations, subject to an appeal to the Board of Trade. With the conclusions arrived at by Major Marindin the Vestry generally agreed, but they dissented from his recommendation, in a subsequent portion of the Report (which it 70 has not been deemed necessary to reproduce in extenso), that the two Companies to be allotted to the Parish should be the St. James's and Pall Mall Company, who were already in possession of the field acting under a licence, and the Londou Electric Supply Corporation, who obtained a footing by means not contemplated when the Electric Lighting Act was passed in 1882, and to whose system the Vestry entertained strong objections. Nothwithstanding Major Marindin's Report, however, the Vestry still view with grave apprehension the introduction of a system of electric lighting by which the current is carried under the streets at so high a tension as 10,000 volts. Some correspondence ensued with the Board of Trade as to the particular Company to be admitted into the Parish to compete with the local Company, but the Board explained that they had been obliged toconsider the circumstances of London generally, and regretted that it had not been found possible in every case to give effect to the wishes of the various Local Authorities. In the result, a Provisional Older was granted to the London Electric Supply Corporation, this Parish being included in their area of supply, which Order has since been confirmed by Parliament. The Parishioners will thus have the option of taking a supply of electricity from either one of two Companies, who are generating and distributing the current on entirely different systems. Experience alone will show whether either system possesses the advantages of economy and applicability to all purposes, or whether one is better adapted to some conditions and the other to different conditions. 71 Application has been made to the Board of Trade by the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company for a Provisional Order to replace the Licence under which they are working. The Vestry entertain no objection to the Company obtaining an Order, provided they thereby come under an obligation to supply electricity in every part of the Parish without distinction, and are otherwise subject to the usual terms of a Provisional Order. A satisfactory arrangement has been come to between the Vestry and the Company, and the Provisional Order will probably in due course be made by the Board of Trade and confirmed by Parliament. STREET NAMES. The London County Council having enquired the views of the Vestry upon a suggestion that Old and New Bond Street should be incorporated under the name of "Bond Street," the Vestry replied that it appeared to them essential to continue the prefixes in order to prevent confusion arising with Bond Streets in other parts of London. The Council have apparently adopted this view, for no alteration has been made in the name. Only one Order relating to Street naming has been received during the year, and that was abolishing the name of Tichborne Street and numbering the few houses therein in Regent Street. STREETS PARTLY SITUATE IN OTHER PARISHES. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 6th March, 1857, placing that portion of Oxford Street which is situate in the Parish of St. James under the jurisdiction of the Vestry of St. Marylebone for all the purposes of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The cost 72 of lighting, paving, cleansing, watering, &c., that portion of the thoroughfare is ascertained annually and paid by the Vestry. By an Order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated the 10th August, 1866, specified sections of the following thoroughfares are placed under the exclusive management of the Yestries of St. James and St. George, Hanover Square, respectively, throughout the entire width thereof, instead of according to the actual Parish Boundary, viz.:—Regent Street, Piccadilly, Burlington Gardens, St. James's Street, and Park Place. No payment is made by either Yestry to the other under this Order, the exchange of area being regarded as an equivalent. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 21st December, 1883, placing so much of the carriageway of Wardour Street as lies south of Mead's Court under the exclusive management of the Vestry for the purposes of cleansing and maintenance, and the remainder of the street under the exclusive management, for the same purposes, of the Strand District Board. An arrangement made some years since with the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the apportionment of Coventry Street as regards the cleansing and paving, in consequence of the boundary line being somewhat irregular, is still in force. PAYING AND DRAINAGE WORKS. Most of the paving and drainage works during the past year consisted of maintenance and repair. A few streets were paved with asphalte under contract by the French Asphalte Company, whose tender was accepted in open competition. Further details of the various paving and drainage works carried out during the year will be found in the Surveyor's Report, commencing on page 123. 73 MAIN ROADS. In pursuance of the resolution adopted at the Conference of Metropolitan Road Authorities, at Chelsea Town Hall, to which reference was made in the Vestry's Annual Report for last year, application has been made to the County Council to make an order declaring the undermentioned thorough- fares to be main roads, for the reason slated opposite the name of each thoroughfare. The Vestry at the same time intimated that they would claim to retain the power reserved to them by the Local Government Act of maintaining and repairing all streets in this Parish which may be declared to be main roads:— Streets- Length. Reasons. Furlongs. Yards. Piccadilly 2 131 Omnibus Routes. Through roads connecting Kensington and the West with the City. Coventry Street 154 Haymarket 1 106 Through Road from Piccadilly to Charing Cross Station via Pall Mall East. Wardour Street 3 109 Through Road from Oxford Street to Charing Cross Station via Whitcomb Street or Leicester Square. St. James's Street 1 153 Through Road from Piccadilly to Victoria Station via St. James's Park. Pall Mall 2 53 Through Road from Charing Cross to Victoria Station via St. James's Park. Pall Mall (East end) 106 Omnibus Route. Regent Street 5 109 Omnibus Route. Through Roads connecting North-West London with the South. Waterloo Place 107 Shaftesbury Avenue 1 101 Omnibus Route. Through Road connecting West London with North-East. Tichborne Street 91 Omnibus Route connecting Regent Street and Coventry Street. Oxford Street. 2 72 Omnibus Route. Through Road connecting Notting Hill and the West with the City. 74 If a thoroughfare is declared a "main road" the maintenance thereof passes under the Local Government Act to the County Council, unless the Local Authority exercise the option conferred upon them by the Act and retain the maintenance of the road in their own hands. In the latter case the Council are to make a contribution towards the cost incurred by the Local Authority instead of themselves carrying out the work. It is evident that if the extent of main road3 in the Metropolis is largely increased, the amount of the precept of the London County Council will necessarily be proportionately augmented, and that, indirectly, the burden of local taxation may be varied in incidence. It might happen, for instance, that the suburban districts would be called upon to pay a considerable sum for the repair of main roads, and derive but little direct benefit in the form of contributions ; while, although more central districts were equally called upon to pay a larger sum to the County Council (this sum being raised according to the rateable value of the district), yet they would derive considerable benefit in the form of contributions, owing to the greater length of main roads situate in the district. The question, when it is dealt with, must be settled in a comprehensive manner, and it is therefore not surprising that the County Council hesitate to declare any further thoroughfares main roads. MAINS UNDER STRERTS. In the month of November the Vestry assented to the London Electric Supply Corporation laying mains of a pattern submitted under certain streets in the Parish. The mains actually laid, however, differ considerably from the pattern approved, and do not afford the same amount of 75 protection against injury by a pickaxe or chisel. It appears to the Vestry necessary to have the mains re-laid at a greater depth, and they have accordingly served notice upon the Corporation to make this alteration. In the meantime the laying of further mains is suspended. The St. James's and Pall Mall Company have, with the consent of the Vestry, laid a considerable length of mains under the streets. This Company, from the necessities of the system they have adopted, occupy for their mains a considerably larger space than that required by the competing Company. In the month of April the Grand Junction Water Works Company laid a main in Duke Street without previously submitting a plan to the Vestry for approval. An explanation was, however, subsequently given of the circumstances under which the omission to submit a plan had occurred, and the Vestry did not deem it necessary to take any action in the matter. HOUSE DRAINAGE. Having experienced some difficulty in securing a satisfactory amendment of an old system of house drainage under the existing law, the Vestry have suggested to the London County Council the desirability of an early opportunity being taken for an amendment of the law, so that a Local Authority may exercise identical powers with regard to a worn-out system of drainage, in the case of an old house, as they at present possess with respect to the drainage of new houses. The Vestry have further suggested that penalties should be enforceable if a house drain is laid except in the presence 76 of a public officer duly authorized in that behalf, or covered in without a certificate from such officer that the drain is laid with a proper fall, is properly jointed, has been fully tested, and is otherwise satisfactory. No action, however, has been taken by the County Council in the matter. KEFUGES. The following is a list of Refuges in the Parish:— Great Marlborough Street. Haymarket, South end. Pall Mall, by the United Service Club. ,, by the Athenæum Club. „ by St. James's Palace. ,, by the Haymarket. Piccadilly, by St. James's Street. ,, by Burlington House. ,, by Vestry Hall. ,, by Piccadilly Circus. ,, by the Haymarket. Piccadilly Circus (2 Refuges).

Waterloo Place (two). One of these has been formed during the year. CONSTRUCTION OF VAULTS. The following regulations have been made in regard to the construction of vaults under footways:— 1. That plans and sections of proposed vaults be submitted and deposited with the Vestry. 2. That no deviation of such plan as sanctioned be made during the execution of the work, without the consent of the Vestry. 3. That all walls and arches be at least one brick, or nine inches thick. 4. That the space from the upper surface of the pavement to the outside of the vault be in no case less than three feet. 5. That no vault be allowed to project beyond the outside line of kerb where the footway is ten feet or more in width, and in no case shall the outside of the brickwork be carried nearer than three feet six inches to the centre line of the carriageway. SANITARY. It will be seen on reference to the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, commencing on page 177, and the appendices thereto, that continuous attention has been paid to the abatement and removal of nuisances. It is impossible, however, to convey any accurate idea of the extent or value of sanitary work by the mere tabulation of figures. The most satisfactory proof of the value of this department of the Vestry's work is afforded by the reduction in the rate of mortality in the Parish since the creation of a sanitary department some thirty years since. 78 Without here further entering into details, it may be remarked that the Medical Officer of Health reports that the death rate of the parish was 10.51 per 1,000 for the year 1889, as compared with a rate of 17.4 for the whole Metropolis. The cases of fever were again unusually numerous during the year, but were chiefly infantile in character and marked by a very low rate of mortality. Thus, 1 case of small-pox, 59 of scarlet fever, 13 of enteric or typhoid fever, and 2 of diphtheria, came under the knowledge of the sanitary officers, but only 9 deaths were attributable to these diseases. Two officers have been constantly engaged in the work of inspection with a view to detecting and removing nuisances, but the Vestry are still more anxious to prevent unsanitary conditions which give rise to nuisances. With this object they once more appeal to the parishioners for intelligent co-operation, especially to such as by their avocations are brought into contact with residents in the poorer and more crowded districts. The Vestry will be glad at all times to receive early information of any nuisance or supposed nuisance. It is not absolutely necessary that the name and address of the informant should be given in all cases, although it is very desirable that this should be done where possible, in order to save loss of time in fruitless inquiry. Another and most valuable mode of assisting in maintaining a high degree of public health is for each householder to insist upon scrupulous cleanliness being observed in the premises under his control. It cannot be too strongly urged that proper precautions against infection will also do much to insure immunity from 79 sickness generally. The great preventive of disease is cleanliness—cleanliness in living, cleanliness of person, and cleanliness of surroundings. The Vestry, as the local Sanitary Authority, are constantly striving after this condition of things, but unless the parishioners generally heartily cooperate in their several spheres, a great part of the work of the Vestry will be rendered nugatory. The Vestry are strongly impressed with the value of portable dust receptacles, of proper description, as a means of cleanliness, and urge their adoption universally in place of the old type of brick-built dustbins, which are frequently placed in most unsuitable positions. REMOVAL OF OFFENSIVE REFUSE. The Vestry have from time to time received complaints of the annoyance occasioned by the collection of offensive refuse from various businesses at unsuitable hours, and the conveyance of such refuse through the public streets in open receptacles or vehicles not adapted to the purpose. Under the existing law, the Vestry have not sufficient power to deal satisfactorily with cases of this kind, and they have therefore asked the Local Government Board to initiate legislation with a view to enabling local Sanitary Authorities to make and enforce, under a sufficient penalty, bye-laws regulating the mode and time of collecting offensive refuse, and conveying the same through the streets. SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND COWSHEDS. At the commencement of the year there were two licensed slaughter houses in the Parish. One of them ceased to be 80 occupied during the year, and the licence has not been renewed, and at the present time there is therefore but one slaughter house in the Parish. It appeared to the Vestry that the time had arrived for the removal of slaughter houses from the centres of population, and they therefore objected to the continued existence of a slaughter house in the rear of premises in Walker's Court. The County Council, however, renewed the licence. There are no licensed cow-houses in the Parish. INFECTIOUS DISEASE (NOTIFICATION) ACT, 1889. Having at various times during several years past expressed themselves in favour of legislation requiring the occurrence of cases of infectious disease to be notified to the local Sanitary Authority, the Vestry were gratified at the passing of the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889. The main features of this Act have been made widely known in the Parish, a notice in the following terms having been left at each house:— The Local Authority of the above-named District direct attention to the provisions of the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, which applies to this district and to every district of the Metropolis on and after the 31st October, 1889. The following is a summary of the provisions:— Notification of Infectious Disease.—Where an inmate of any building, ship, vessel, boat, tent, van, shed, or similar structure used for human habitation is suffering from an infectious disease, namely, small-pox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas, the disease known as scarlatina or scarlet fever, and the fevers known by any of the following names : typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing, continued, or puerperal, or any infectious disease to which the Act has been 81 applied by the Local Authority of the District in manner provided, then, unless such building is a hospital in which persons suffering from an infectious disease are received : By Private Persons.—The head of the family to which such inmate (referred to as the patient)-belongs, and in his default the nearest relatives of the patient present in the building or being in attendance on the patient, and in default of such relatives every person in charge of or in attendance on the patient, and in default of any such person the occupier of the building must, as soon as he becomes aware that the patient is suffering from an infectious disease to which the Act applies, send notice thereof to the Medical Officer of Health of the district. The expression "occupier" includes a person having the charge, management, or control of a building, or of the part of a building in which the patient is, and in the case of a house the whole of which is let out in separate tenements, or in the case of a lodginghouse the whole of which is let to lodgers, the person receiving the rent payable by the tenants or lodgers either on his own account or as the agent of another person, and in the case of a ship, vessel, or boat, the master or other person in charge thereof. By Medical Practitioner. — Every medical practitioner attending on or called in to visit a patient must forthwith, on becoming aware that the patient is suffering from an infectious disease to which the Act applies, send to the Medical Officer of Health for the district a certificate stating the name of the patient, the situation of the building, and the infectious disease from which, in the opinion of such medical practitioner, the patient is suffering. Penalties.—Every person required to give a notice or certificate who fails to give the same, is liable on summary conviction in manner provided by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts to a fine not exceeding forty shillings: Provided that if a person is not required to give notice in the first instance, but only in default of some other person, he shall not be liable to any fine if he satisfies the Court that he had reasonable cause to suppose that the notice had been duly given. F 82 The address of the Medical Officer of Health, to whom Notices are to be sent, is James Edmunds, Esq., M.D., &c., 8, Grafton Street, Bond Street, W. A Notice or Certificate to be sent to a Medical Officer of Health may be sent by being delivered to him, or by being left at his office or residence, or may be sent by post addressed to him at his office or at his residence. From the date when the Act came into operation (October 31st) until the close of the Vestry's year, at Lady Day, 42 cases of Infectious Disease were notified to the Medical Officer of Health, viz.:— Small-Pox 0 Cholera 0 Diphtheria 3 Membraneous Croup 0 Erysipelas 2 Scarlet Fever 22 Typhus Fever 0 Typhoid Fever 18 Relapsing Fever 0 Continued Fever 1 Puerperal Fever 1 42 REMOVAL OF THE INFECTIOUS SICK TO HOSPITAL. Under the provisions of the Poor Law Act, 1889, the Metropolitan Asylums Board have power to allow their Ambulance Service to be used for the conveyance of persons suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder to and from Hospitals and places other than Asylums provided by the Board. 83 The Board have issued the following Regulations for the use of their Ambulances:— 1. Apply on Week-days, between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. to the Chief Offices:- Postal Address: Norfolk House, Norfolk Street, Strand, W.C. Telegraphic Address: Asylums Board, London. Telephone Number 2,587. N.B.—Applications in the latter part of the day must be dispatched in time to reach the Offices before 8 p.m. At Night, between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., and on Sundays, Christmas Day, and Good Friday, to the Ambulance Stations:— Eastern Ambulance Station, Brooksby's Walk, Homerton, N.E. South-Eastern Ambulance Station, New Cross Road (near Old Kent Road Bailway Station), S.E. Western Ambulance Station, Seagrave Boad, Fulham, S.W. 2. Removal to the Board's Hospitals. {a) Only persons suffering from Smallpox, Fevers, or Diphtheria are admitted into the Board's Hospitals. (b) Every application must state the name, age, and full address of the patient, from what disease suffering, and in cases of fever the particular kind of fever; and also the name of the person making the application. (c) Unless a Medical Certificate be handed to the Ambulance Nurse the patient will not be removed. (d) Patients should leave all valuables, money, &c., and all outside clothing at home, should wear body linen only, and be wrapped in the blankets provided for the purpose.

Conveyance to other Places. (a) Persons suffering from any Dangerous Infectious disorder may be conveyed by Ambulance to places other than the Board's Hospitals. N.B.—Dangerous Infectious Disorders include the following : Smallpox, Cholera, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Erysipelas, Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever, Typhus, Typhoid, Enteric, Belapsing, Continued and Puerperal Fevers, and Measles. F 2 84 (b) Every application for an Ambulance must state : — (i). Name, sex, and age of patient. (li). Description of disease, and, in the case of fever, the particular kind of fever. (iii). Fall address from which the patient is to be conveyed. (iv). Full address to which the patient is to be conveyed. (c) The patient must be provided with a Medical Certificate of the nature of the disease, to be handed to the driver of the Ambulance. (d) The charge for the hire of the Ambulance, including (when the patient is over ten years of age) the services of a male attendant, is 5s. This amount must be paid to the Driver, who will give an official receipt for the same. (e) One person only will be allowed to accompany the patient, and such person may be conveyed back to the place from which the patient was conveyed. (/) The Ambulances may be sent outside the Metropolitan district only by special sanction of the Ambulance Committee or of the Clerk to the Board, and in such cases an extra charge will be made of 1s. for every mile outside the Metropolitan area. 4. The Drivers of the Board's Ambulances are not allowed to loiter on their journeys or to stop for refreshments on pain of instant dismissal. It is particularly requested that any breach of this regulation, or any neglect or incivility on the part of the Drivers, Nurses, or Attendants may be immediately reported to the undersigned. The Servants of the Board are forbidden to accept any gratuities or refreshments. INSANITARY AREAS. The Vestry have had under consideration, on several occasions during the year, the question of dealing with areas in the Parish under the provisions of Cross's Acts. These Acts provide for the reconstruction of any area, comprising houses, courts or alleys which are unfit for human 85 habitation, or in which diseases indicating a generally low condition of health amongst the population have been from time to time prevalent, and such prevalence may reasonably be attributed to sanitary defects which cannot be remedied otherwise than by an improvement scheme for the rearrangement and reconstruction of the streets and houses within the area. The Acts are put in force by the Medical Officer of Health for the Parish or District, and the Authority for carrying the Acts into execution in the Metropolis is the London County Council. After inspecting such portions of the Parish as appeared most likely to come within the scope of Cross's Acts, the Sanitary Committee submitted two areas for special consideration. These were the Walker's Court area, including Down's Place, and the Marlborough Row area, including portions of Carnaby Street and Ganton Street. Dr. Edmunds, the Medical Officer of Health, Being absent on leave at the time, his locum tenens, Dr. C. E. Dumbleton, was appointed temporary Medical Officer of Health, and requested to prepare a detailed report upon both areas. With regard to Walker's Court he was requested to bear in mind the value to the poorer class of residents of the street market in the immediate neighbourhood, and the importance of retaining and if practicable extending the same, in any scheme for reconstructing the area. A very comprehensive report was subsequently presented by Dr. Dumbleton, from which it appeared that neither area could be regarded as overcrowded, that in both the w.c. accommodation was sufficient in proportion to the number of inhabitants, and that both had exhibited an almost complete absence of zymotic disease for some period. 86 The conclusions arrived at by Dr. Dumbleton with regard to the Walker's Court area, were summed up as follows:— The most conspicuous sanitary defect in this area is the want of sufficient through ventilation. This appears a theoretical defect, and has manifested no practical significance. This defect has been produced by an increasing demand for dwelling accommodation, which has induced owners of property to build the nine cottages in Downs Place, and the two at the back of No. 95, Wardour Street. So great has been this demand for dwelling-rooms that, in some houses, the staircase windows have been removed, and in their places hang doors opening into small rooms, abutting against the back wall. The difficulties that present themselves in making a representation to the London County Council with regard to this area, are as follows:— (1) The Walker's Court area is a business centre, occupied by respectable and apparently prosperous tradesmen, and can scarcely bebrought under the provisions of an Act that deals with the "Improvement of Artizans and Labourers Dwellings." The labouring classes are met with in Downs Place and St. Peter's Buildings, but are not numerous in other parts of the area. (2) The area has undergone great improvement during recent years, but few, if any, of the houses could now be classed as '• unfit for human habitation." (3) There is almost an entire absence of present sickness. There is no zymotic disease. With regard to the occurrence of zymotic diseases during the previous six years, this area will compare most favourably with other parts of the parish. (4) The sanitary defects can be remedied otherwise than by an Improvement Scheme for the re-construction of the entire area. Dr. Dumbleton concluded his report upon the Marlborough Row area as follows:— The difficulties that present themselves in making a representation to the London County Council with respect to this area are as follows :— (1) The area has undergone considerable improvement within late years, and the owners contemplate immediate reconstruction of three houses in Carnaby Street and four in Marlborough Row. 87 (2) The sanitary defects in the remainder are not such that they cannot be remedied otherwise than by an improvement scheme. (3) There is an entire absence of present general or zymotic sickness. (4) The occurrence of zymotic disease during the previous six years has been almost confined to a few cases at Nos. 14, 15, and 16, Carnaby Street, which are to be rebuilt by the owner. (5) The only house that could be condemned, in its present state, as "unfit for human habitation," is No. 2, Marlborough Row, where there is a prevalence of a low condition of health, due to its being occupied too soon after construction. Having regard to the terms of Dr. Dumbleton's report, the Vestry felt that it was useless to pursue the matter further, beyond, referring the report to the Sanitary Committee with a view to action being taken for the amelioration of individual houses from time to time. The Vestry, however, feel that it must be highly satisfactory to the parishioners that a thorough investigation of the two areas which are admittedly those most open to objection from a sanitary point of view should have, somewhat unexpectedly, yielded such results. ST. JAMES'S DWELLINGS. This property continues to be well let, although necessarily there is a frequent change of tenants. During the year the Vestry have been able to invest £200 as the commencement of a sinking fund to replace the capital on the expiration of the leases. The use of the laundry in the basement having been found to be detrimental to the building, in consequence of the confined situation of the room preventing the steam escaping freely, the Yestry decided to discontinue the same, and to let the room for other purposes. In view of the contiguity of the Public Wash-houses in Dufour's Place, where every 88 venience is afforded for washing, mangling, and ironing, at a small charge, practically no inconvenience is caused by the closing of the laundry in the Dwellings. The whole of the basement has been let as a warehouse at a rental of £50 per annum. A copy of the Accounts of the Trust Fund will be found on pages 150 and 151. REGISTERED HOUSES. As considerable misapprehension appears to exist with regard to the effect of registering houses under the Sanitary Regulations of the Vestry, it may be as well to explain that the objects of registration are:— (1) To define the number of persons who may lawfully occupy a particular room or house. (2) To secure adequate water-closet accommodation. (3) To secure a sufficient supply of water. (4) To ensure the cleanliness of the premises. Under the Regulations, an occupier is responsible for keeping in proper condition a water-closet, cistern, washhouse, yard, &c., which is under his exclusive control, and the throwing upon the occupier of a burden which rightly belongs to him is an assistance to an owner troubled with dirty or destructive tenants. A house registered under these Regulations does not become a "Common Lodging House," nor is it in the slightest degree under police surveillance, nor is it distinguished by any inscription or mark whatever. Eight houses have been registered during the year, and it is intended to extend the registration by degrees until all the houses in the Parish to which the Regulations apply have been registered. 89 It has not been found necessary to take proceedings for a breach of the Regulations in a single case during the past year. APPOINTMENT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH UNDER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT. Under the provisions of the Local Government Act, the appointment of Medical Officers of Health, after the passing of the Act, is subject to the approval of the Local Government Board, and a portion of the sa'ary paid to those Officers will be repayable by the County Council. The Vestry, in common with many other local Authorities, considered the desirability of asking their Medical Officer to resign, with a view to his being re-appointed subject to the conditions prescribed by the Local Government Board, and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, they decided to take no action in the matter. INSPECTION OF BAKEHOUSES. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, having transferred to the Local Sanitary Authorities the duty of inspecting retail bakehouses, the following abstract of the requirements of the law with regard to the cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding and sanitary condition of retail bakehouses is given for the information of parishioners:— 1. A bakehouse to be in conformity with the Acts relating to retail bakehouses, is subject to the following requirements:— (or.) It must be kept in a cleanly state, and free from effluvia arising from any drain, privy, or other nuisance. 90 (b) It must not be so overcrowded while work is carried on therein as to be injurious to the health of the persons employed, and shall be ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, so far as practicable, all the gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the manufacturing process that may be injurious to health. (c) The ceilings or tops of the bakehouse and all passages and staircases must either be painted with oil, or varnished, or limewashed or partly painted or varnished and partly limewashed. If painted or varnished, the surface must be covered with three coats of paint or varnish, and renewed once at least in every seven years, and washed with hot water and soap once at least in every six months. Limewashing is to be renewed once at least in every six months. 2. No place on the same level with the bakehouse and forming part of the same building may be used as a sleeping place, unless it is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and has an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which at least four-and-a-half feet are made to open for ventilation. 3. A bakehouse must not be in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a bakehouse. 4. No child, young person, or woman may be employed in a bakehouse contrary to the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878. Penalties are provided in the event of an infringement of the law; the bakehouses brought into use after the 31st of May, 1883, are subject to certain further requirements. The bakehouses in the parish (33 in number) are under frequent inspection by the Sanitary Officers of the Vestry. It has not been found necessary to take proceedings against the occupiers of any premises of that description during the past year. 91 SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. The following is a list of the articles purchased by the Inspector, and submitted to the Public Analyst, appointed by the Vestry during the year:— Coffee 18 Cream 1 Milk 34 53 One sample of coffee proved to contain an excessive quantity of added chicory, but as it was labelled as a mixture, the Vestry did not deem it advisable to take proceedings. The vendor of this sample was, however, cautioned, as were also the vendors of two other samples of coffee of doubtful character. The milk generally was reported to be of good quality. One sample yielded a smaller quantity of solid residue than the standard, but as the deficiency was not more than such as might arise from the cow being out of condition, the Vestry merely called the attention of the Vendor to the matter. The cost incurred by the Vestry for the year in respect of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act is as follows :— £ s. d. Allowance to Analyst 75 0 0 Purchase of Samples, &c. 0 8 2 75 8 2 92 SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS. Summonses have been taken out for the following offences :— Erecting Projections 3 Obstructing Footway 2 Placing Rubbish on Carriageway 1 6 Two of the projections complained of were removed, and the summons withdrawn in each case. The third, which is the fixed shelter erected in front of the Lyric Theatre, not only without the consent of the Vestry but in the face of their direct disapproval of the plans submitted to them, formed the subject of police-court proceedings extending over some time. In the result, the magistrate inflicted a nominal penalty, and on the application of the defendant's counsel expressed his willingness to state a case on a point of law for the opinion of the High Court. The summons was taken out under the 72nd section of Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, and the contention of the defendant's counsel was that that section was repealed by the 247th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act as being inconsistent with the 119th section of the same Act, and it is upon this point, which was decided by the magistrate against the defendant, that the appeal to the High Court is to be taken. As it is important that the power of the Vestry to prevent or control erections over public footways should be clearly defined, it is the intention of the Vestry to press the case. The summonses taken out for causing obstructions on the footway, and for placing rubbish on the carriageway, each resulted in the infliction of a penalty. 93 DISORDERLY HOUSES. In consequence of a return to the former practice by the Police of rendering assistance to the Local Authority in the observation of alleged brothels, the Vestry have been enabled to prosecute with success a larger number of keepers of Disorderly Houses than for three or four years past. Perhaps the most important prosecution undertaken by the Vestry was that against the owner of a house for being a party to the continued use of the premises as a brothel. In this case the full penalty for a first offence (£20) was inflicted. The Criminal Law Amendment Act, by rendering unnecessary the old procedure of entering into recognizances, and enabling the Magistrate to dispose of the cases summarily, has both cheapened and expedited the legal proceedings. Early in the year, the Vigilance Society of an adjoiningParish took proceedings under the old Act, and the nominal informers claimed the rewards to which they were entitled. Altogether the Society obtained five convictions, three of them being of lodgers only, and, so far, of trivial importance, but under the old Act informers claimed and have been paid the statutory reward of £20 in each case. The cost to the rates if the Parish undertake a prosecution is probably about £10 on the average, and as the Vestry some years since adopted a standing order directing proceedings to be taken against keepers of disorderly houses upon a proper complaint being made to the Vestry Clerk, supported by sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution, it is difficult to understand why ratepayers should prefer the more costly process of proceeding. If the penalties inflicted were allowed to be applied in payment of the expenses of the prosecution, even the cost named might be materially reduced. 94 Apart, however, from the question of cost, a greater objection exists to the independent action of a private body, and that is tbe possibility of conflict with the public body authorized by law to take proceedings in such cases, leading to waste of funds and energy, and other evils. In one of the cases taken up by the "Vigilance Society, the Vestry had been at some pains to enquire as to whether the owner of the house was not knowingly letting the house for immoral purposes, with a view to taking proceedings against him, but their efforts were rendered nugatory by the Society proceeding independently against one of the lodgers, before the enquiries were completed. Regarding this state of affairs as most unsatisfactorv, the Vestry appointed a Committee to confer with a Committee of the St. George's Vestry, who are also called upon to pay large sums in the form of rewards to informers, as to the steps to be taken to amend the law in this respect. The following is an extract from the Report of the Committee, which was adopted by the Vestry on the 19th December:— Even if the payment of rewards were necessary, the amount at which they were fixed more than a century ago, when informers were put to personal trouble and inconvenience, besides risk of heavy costs, is out of all proportion to the cost of the proceedings and the trouble involved under the amending law. In the majority of cases, moreover, the informers make but one attendance, if any, at a Police Court, and rarely, if ever, enter the witness box. Your Sub-Committee have reason to believe further that one of the informers in three recent prosecutions in this Parish did not possess the slightest personal knowledge of the character of the houses he complained of, and that the information upon which the warrants were granted was sworn to by a person employed by the Vigilance Society, without the slightest assistance from the informer. That an informer should be entitled to receive £30 under such circumstances seems to your Sub-Committee a violation of the spirit of the law. 95 Your Sub-Committee have to submit for approval the following Resolution, which was unanimously adopted, on the motion of Mr. Southon, of St. George's, seconded by Mr. Priyett, of StJames's:— " That in the opinion of this Meeting it is desirable for the two Vestries to approach the Home Secretary (through their representatives in Parliament) in support of an alteration in the law relating to the prosecution of keepers of Disorderly Houses, so far as regards the payment of rewards to informers, either by abolishing the system of informers altogether or limiting the payment of rewards to cases in which Local Authorities decline to prosecute on information brought under their notice properly authenticated." It should be stated that the Vestry had previously communicated with the Home Secretary direct, and had received an assurance from him that he would give full consideration to the views of the Vestry before the next Session of Parliament, but that he could not promise to introduce legislation on the subject, and thus the question still rests. DRINKING FOUNTAIN. There is but one Drinking Fountain in the Parish, that in the Churchyard wall in Piccadilly. This Fountain was erected and is maintained without cost to the Vestry. CONVENIENCES, PICCADILLY CIRCUS. In anticipation of the opening of these Conveniences to the public on the 7th August, members of the London County Council and of the local Sanitary Authorities in adjacent Parishes were invited to a private inspection on the previous day. For the information of visitors, copies of the following statement were distributed:— 96 The Conveniences at Piccadilly Circus, which are to be opened to the public on the 7th August, have been constructed by the Vestry of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, at a cost of about £3,500. The Vestry have for many years past felt the necessity of increasing the number of public urinals in the Parish, and as the district is yearly becoming less residential in character, accommodation of the kind is more and more needed for the growing number of people brought into the neighbourhood for business purposes. It is probably generally agreed that the number of public urinals in most parts of the Metropolis is totally inadequate to meet the requirements of the present population, and there is also a general consensus of opinion that, whatever may be an appropriate site for such a structure, any position which may be selected is the most objectionable site that could be chosen—from the point of view of residents in the immediate vicinity. Within the last 10 or 12 years many projects for increasing necessary accommodation have been formed, and the majority of them have been abandoned in deference to the strongly expressed dissent of neighbours. In one case, indeed, as recently as 1879, the Vestry disregarded the opposition of the residents and erected a public urinal in Old Burlington Mews, deeming the objections that were taken to the proposal to be without good foundation. An undoubted nuisance existed on the very spot selected for the urinal, and it appeared to the Vestry desirable, alike in the interests of decency and health, to provide a suitable structure. The inhabitants however appealed to the Courts of Law, and in the result succeeded in obtaining an injunction restraining the Vestry from continuing the urinal, and throwing the costs of the proceedings (amounting to several hundreds of pounds) upon the Vestry. At various times proposals have been made to construct underground urinals in some of the larger spaces in the Parish, such as Great Marlborough Street by the Police Court, and the Circuses, but on each occasion strenuous opposition was threatened, and the schemes were, with some reluctance, abandoned. It is obvious that public urinals are very largely used by strangers to the neighbourhood, and, that to be of the maximum benefit, they should therefore not be placed in obscure corners, but in such situations as not to require a prolonged search. At the same time, the natural prejudice against the construction of urinals in prominent positions, on the part of ratepayers in the vicinity, who have to defray the cost of constructing and maintaining the Conveniences, must be respected, and thus the action of the Vestry is considerably fettered. Signs are not wanting, however, that this prejudice is becoming weaker, and it is possible that 97 in comparatively few years a well appointed and carefully attended urinal will be regarded as far less objection able than a continuance of street nuisances. The Vestry believe that that they have shown, in the case of the underground Conveniences at Piccadilly Circus, that it is possible to make provision of the kind without offence to the eye or any other sense. The construction of the Conveniences at the Circus has been under consideration for some years. Before the new street, now known as Shaftesbury Avenue, was completed, the Vestry suggested to the Metropolitan Board of Works that advantage should be taken of the improvement to provide some such accommodation. On the 18th July, 1885, a deputation of the Vestry waited upon the Board with a memorial, praying that the space which is now enclosed with baulks of timber might be formed into an ornamental space, with perhaps a fountain or statue in the centre, and an underground urinal, with proper approaches, constructed under the same. No definite reply being received to this memorial, the Vestry again waited upon the Board in the following year, and requested to be allowed to utilize the space themselves in the manner suggested, if the Board were unable or unwilling to do so. It was not until nearly two years later (January, 1888), that the Vestry received an intimation of the views entertained by the Board on these two suggestions. They then learned that the Board had decided that, in view of all the circumstances, it was not expedient to comply with the request of the Vestry. The site first suggested was, as it still is, enclosed, but a triangular space to the east of the entrance to Shaftesbury Avenue had been paved and added to the street. It had thus, under the provisions of the Special Act of Parliament authorizing the improvement, passed to the Vestry, and the latter at once intimated to the Metropolitan Board of Works their intention of exercising the powers conferred on them by the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and of providing public conveniences on, or rather under, that site. The Board, in reply, intimated that they would oppose the carrying out of this intention, and brought pressure to bear upon the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, to whom the freehold of the ground would revert if the surface ceased to form part of the street, to prevent the construction of the conveniences. The Vestry freely recognized the propriety of deferring to the views of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, and therefore approached Colonel Ringscote with plans of the proposed Works, to which they sought the G 98 assent of the Commissioners. Some correspondence ensued, and ultimately the Vestry were gratified to learn that although Colonel Kingscote, in face of the objections taken by the Metropolitan Board of Works and a few occupiers of Crown property in the vicinity, felt bound to decline to give any approval of the scheme, yet as the Vestry appeared to be still of opinion that the conveniences were needed in the interests of the public, he would not further oppose their construction in accordance with the drawings submitted, subject to certain specified amendments. The Vestry were thus spared the necessity of considering whether they should not exercise the power which they undoubtedly possessed, apart from any consent, of constructing public conveniences at the Circus on the level of the street. The conveniences have been constructed by Messrs. B. Finch and Co.,. of Belvedere Road, Lambeth, whose drawings were accepted by the Vestry after limited competition (five firms of Sanitary Engineers having been invited to submit designs), subject to some slight modifications. The superstructure, consisting of a group of ornamental lamps on a polished granite base, was designed by Mr. H. J. Treadwell, F.S.I., of 2, Waterloo Place, who was appointed special Surveyor to advise the Vestry on questions of detail and to supervise the carrying out of the work. The Conveniences are divided into two sections, each having a separate entrance from the street, the larger being designed for the use of Gentlemen, and the smaller for Ladies. Both sections are approached from the street by a stone staircase there being two flights of stairs, one for entrance and one for exit, for the Men, and a single staircase for the Ladies. The accommodation provided in the men's section consists of 27 urinals, and 12 w.c.s. The urinals are of the most approved lip pattern, in white glazed ware with chocolate and gold lines, with flushing rims, and are fitted with patent drip pans or gutters at the floor level. These are flushed at every discharge of the cisterns, thus ensuring perfect cleanliness. The divisions are of polished natural "dove" marble, and the backs of polished "rouge royal," with "dove" marble cappings and skirtings, the foot pieces being of white Sicilian marble. The urinals are flushed by means of patent automatic flushing cisterns These are formed in dove marble with plate glass fronts, and ensure a regularly recurring flush. 99 Most of the urinals are ranged round the walls, but there is a central group of eight directly under the dome, which is formed by the granite lamp base over, presenting an effective feature in the interior arrangement. The w.c.s are Finch's "Holborn Combination," and are flush-out apparatus, with trap combined, and of an ornamental pattern, with polished mahogany seats which are fitted with balance weights, maintaining the seat in a vertical position when not in use, and thus helping to ensure cleanliness. Each w.c. is provided with a 3-gallon syphon flushing cistern of approved pattern connected to the apparatus with a 1½in. lead pipe, and producing a perfect flush. The divisions between w.c.s are single slabs of polished "dove" marble, and the fronts and doors are formed in pitch-pine with chamfered and moulded framing. Each door is provided with a patent indicating bolt, showing at a glance which closets are in use. The accommodation provided in the ladies' compartment consists of five w.c.s and two lavatories. The w.c. apparatus provided here is of the valve pattern, with mahogany seats made in the usual form, excepting that they are made to open readily for cleansing purposes. The divisions and fronts match those in the men's portion. The two lavatories are fitted with white and gold oval basins of the best pattern, with polished dove marble lavatory tops, and mahogany fronts. In this division are provided two mirrors, brushes, combs, &c., the idea being to provide all necessary accommodation for ladies shopping or doing business in the West End. The entrance at the foot of the staircase is carefully screened by a heavy curtain, and the railings at the pavement level are lined with ornamental iron screen work, in order to secure as much privacy as possible. The structure will be completely shut in after closing hours by the Bostwick Company's patent gates fixed on the foot of each staircase. The walls generally are lined with best quality white glazed bricks, and the ceilings are finished in Parian cement. The floors are laid with tiles of bright and ornamental patterns, by Messrs. Carter, Johnson and Co., of Kennington Park Road. G 2 100 Light during the day is obtained by means of Hyatt's patent pavement lights, and through the openings in the dome formed by the granite base of lamp. The artificial lighting is at present by gas, the Wenham Company's patent lamps being used for the general area, and each w.c. being also supplied with a small burner. As soon, however, as the electric mains are completed in the vicinity {which it is expected will be within a few weeks), the electric light will be fitted and supplied by the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Lighting Company of Mason's Yard, S.W. Ventilation is obtained through fresh air inlet gratings at the street level and by the entrance staircases. The foul and heated air is drawn up into the central dome, where an upward current is formed in the shaft of central lamp by means of a small sunlight which is kept burning at its base. The group of lamps in the street is designed in the free renaissance style, and consists of a central pillar with four smaller ones surrounding it, the whole being raised on a base and dome of polished Aberdeen granite, which is enriched with swags of flowers, and the arms of the City of Westminster. The lamp not only forms a handsome ornament to the Circus, but also acts as a ventilating shaft for the underground portion, the dome forming a reservoir for the heated or foul air. The execution of the work was entrusted to the following firms:— The main structure, Messrs. B. Finch & Co.; granite work, Messrs. Fenning & Co.; lamp columns, Messrs. McFarlane & Co.; lanterns and gas fittings, Messrs. W. Sugg & Co.; and fixing the granite base, lamp columns, &c., Messrs. Peto Brothers. No charge will be made for the use of the urinals, but 1d. will be charged to each person using the water closets, and 2d. for the use of the lavatories; the latter are provided in the ladies' compartment only. Two married couples have been engaged as attendants, and the following regulations have been made for their guidance:— 1. The Conveniences shall be opened each morning (except Sunday) at seven o'clock, and kept open until one o'clock the following morning. On Sundays they shall be opened at nine o'clock in the morning and kept open until midnight. 101 2. The first attendant shall commence duty at the opening of the Conveniences each morning, and be relieved by the second attendant at four o'clock. The second attendant shall remain on duty until the Conveniences are closed. Each attendant shall take first turn every alternate week. 3. The attendant on duty, male and female, shall enter each closet immediately after it has been used, and (if necessary) clean the same, and put it in proper condition for being again used. 4. The attendant on duty shall keep the Conveniences for washing in clean and proper condition, and every morning see that a sufficient quantity of clean towels and other articles is available for use. 5. The attendant on duty shall light and extinguish the gas, as occasion requires, and shall at all times see that all taps, apparatus, and fittings of every kind are in proper order, and take all necessary precautions to prevent the waste or undue consumption of water, gas, electricity, and stores. All defects in apparatus or fittings are to be forthwith reported to the Vestry Clerk. 6. Each attendant shall keep an account of all sums received by him or her for the use of the Conveniences, and shall, as often as may be required, pay such sums over to the Officer of the Vestry appointed to collect the same, together with an account showing the amount received for the use of the lavatories and for the use of the closets respectively. 7. The male attendant first on duty shall daily, and as often as occasion requires, sweep, wash down, or otherwise clean the floor and stairs of the Conveniences and the surface in the street above. 8. Each attendant on duty at the time the Conveniences are closed shall, before leaving duty, see that every closet and other convenience is clean and ready for use the following day, that all lights are extinguished and everything left safe and in proper order, and shall securely lock the doors and gates when leaving the building. 9. That the fees payable for the use of closets, &c., be as follows:— Use of closet, each person 1d. Lavatory, with use of clean towel 2d. The Vestry have accepted the offer of the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company to supply the electric light to the Conveniences for a year, free of charge, by way of experiment, and lamps and wires have been provided and fitted by the Company for the agreed sum of .£30. 102 The Vestry have also to acknowledge the gift of shrubs by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association for the adornment and better screening of the entrance to the Ladies' Section. As the Vestry anticipated, the construction of Conveniences in so public a position has proved an immense boon. From the date of opening to the 25th March no less than 97,652 persons have used the men's closets, 87,643 the ladies', and 1,226 the lavatory. From rough computations which have been made at various times, it is estimated that the average number using the urinals, for which no charge is made, is about 50,000 a week. A statement of the receipts and working expenses of the Conveniences will be found in the Accounts commencing on page 136. URINALS. The following is a list of public urinals (in addition to the Piccadilly conveniences above referred to) erected and maintained by the Vestry:— Situation. No. of Compartments. Situation.

Disapproval was expressed of the Charities, &c., Exemption Bill (for exempting Charities from local rates),Guardians of the Poor Qualification Bill (for abolishing the rating qualification of Guardians of the Poor), Metropolis Rating Amendment Bill (for raising ccrtain portions of the expenditure for public improvements by a rate payable by owners of property),. Sanitary Acts (Metropolis) Amendment Bill (which, among other provisions, would render the appointment of a Medical Officer of Health or Inspector of Nuisances subject to the approval of the London County Council), the School Board for London (Pensions) Bill, which would give the guarantee of the rates to the Board's Superannuation Fund, the Theatres (County of London) Bill, which would place the supervision of theatres under the Home Secretary, and the London Streets (Strand Improvement) Bill, so far as relates to the "betterment" clause thereof. The Vestry have also petitioned against the London Subways and Overhead "Wires Bill, with a view to the insertion of clauses (1) to restrict the uncontrolled power which the London County Council seek to obtain to break up streets for the purpose of constructing subways, and (2) to provide for all overhead wires to be removed and placed underground within some specified period, instead of permitting them to remain indefinitely subject to inspection, as proposed by the Bill. 109 The initiation of the Advertisement Rating Bill, which has now become law, was largely due to the personal action of Mr. J. E. Smith, Vestry Clerk of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, and the Vestry acknowledged the services rendered by that gentleman in the matter by a unanimous vote of thanks. Some remarks on the "betterment" clause of the London Streets (Strand Improvement) Bill are given under the next heading, and the action taken by the Vestry with regard to the Central London and London Central Railway Bills is mentioned under the heading of "Parliamentary Schemes, Session, 1890." THE PRINCIPLE OF "BETTERMENT." A clause inserted by the London County Council in their Strand Improvement Bill, for the purpose of creating in favour of the Council a perpetual rent charge upon property within a specified area, varying in amount according to the extent to which the property may be assumed to be increased in value by the improvement, has naturally created much attention, for the clause was avowedly inserted in order to set a precedent for future street improvements. The Vestry carefully considered the question, and came to the conclusion that whatever merits "bettermentmay" possess as an abstract principle, the manner in which it is proposed to be applied to the particular improvement referred to is open to objection. Upon a careful consideration of the clause, it appeared to be evident that considerable difficulty would arise in the practical working out of the scheme. In the first place, the 110 question whether any increased value has actuallv arisen to any particular premises at all has to be determined; then to what extent the value has been increased directly by the improvement, and not by other causes; then the benefit derived by the actual occupier from such increased value, and the proportion of the increased value derived by the lessee and freeholder. In the majority of cases, not one of these questions could be settled by being submitted to the only true test, the open market, but would have to be decided upon hypothetical valuations by professional men. How greatly valuers even with the largest experience differ in their estimates may be seen by reference to any procceedings in which the compulsory sale of property is involved. In the next place, objection might be taken to the arbitrary fixing of an area of "betterment." It is difficult, for instance, to say why the east side of a street should be subject to the charge and not the west side of the same street. Another objection may be taken to a perpetual rent charge being adopted as the basis, instead of a capital sum. For instance, under existing circumstances a building may, from the nature of the business carried on or from other causes, derive considerable present benefit from the improvement, and so be rendered liable to a heavy rent charge in perpetuity, while, a few years hence, the property may, for reasons wholly beyond the control of the owner, altogether alter in character and be then of less annual value than another block of property which is subject to a small rent charge or none at all, because the present occupier or owner derives no immediate advantage from the improvement. From a ratepayers' point of view, the assumed benefit is altogether illusory, and may result in a heavy charge on the rates. It cannot be supposed, for example, that Parliament 111 would allow the Council to extract the full value of "betterment" from the occupiers and owners of properties increased in value by the improvement, and to withhold compensation for losses sustained by the carrying out of the improvement, and experience leads one to believe that claims for compensation would far exceed any sum that could be realized for "betterment." A better example than the formation of Shaftesbury Avenue can scarcely be imagined for illustrating this point. By this improvement, property which was in second-rate thoroughfares has been thrust forward into one which promises to become one of the most important, in proportion to its length, in London. On the other hand tradesmen in neighbouring streets have suffered heavily, by the dispersion of their customers owing to the demolition of property. The channel of traffic has, moreover, been permanently diverted to some extent, and thus the occupiers and owners of property in some thoroughfares are deprived of that natural gradual growth in the value of their businesses and properties which they had a reasonable right to anticipate. In the case of Shaftesbury Avenue, a "betterment" contribution was not taken in respect of property undoubtedly benefited by the improvement, nor was compensation paid for losses undoubtedly arising from the same improvement, It would probably have been found that the cost of compensating losses would have outweighed the produce of the "betterment." But as regards the Strand Improvement, there is 110 thrusting inferior property forward into a main thoroughfare. The Council seek power to purchase, at its present 112 value, and resell at its improved value, all property which will front upon the widened thoroughfare, so that whatever may be the merits of the principle of "betterment" and its natural corollary of compensation in the abstract, whether as a means to lessen the cost of the improvement to the ratepayers, or to more equitably adjust the burden between persons deriving a benelit and those sustaining a loss by the improvement, the County Council would seem to derive the whole of the "betterment" in the present instance, by purchasing and reselling the property under altered conditions. PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES, SESSION 1889. The clauses which the promoters proposed to insert in the Central London (Subway) Railway Bill, to meet the objections of the Vestry, not proving satisfactory, the Vestry continued their opposition to the scheme. The Committee of the House of Commons, to whom the Bill was referred, reported that the preamble was not proved to their satisfaction, and the Bill was therefore rejected. PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES, SESSION 1890. Notices of two intended competing railways to pass under Oxford Street were deposited with the Vestry in November, 1889. One of these, the Central London (Subway) Railway, was almost identical in character with the scheme bearing the name of the London Central (Subway) Railway, in the previous year, except as regards the proposed route. The promoters sought powers which, if granted, would virtually hand over a leading arterial thoroughfare to them for a considerable period, and believing that an underground railway could not be constructed without causing very considerable inconvenience or loss to the owners and 113 piers of property along the line of route, the Vestry determined to co-operate in opposing the scheme in the interests of the ratepayers who would be affected. Active opposition, however, was rendered unnecessary by the abandonment of the scheme at a very early stage. The second scheme is of a different character, presenting greater advantages and fewer disadvantages than the last mentioned. The railway is proposed to be continued to the City, where it would join the City of London and Southwark Subway, instead of stopping short at Holborn as proposed by the opposing schcme, and it is to be constructed without disturbing the surface of the street. It would therefore afford greater convenience by entering the City and forming a connection with another railway, and would prevent the heavy loss to tradesmen and others along the route, during construction, which is involved in diverting or obstructing the traffic. The Vestry, therefore, resolved not to oppose the Bill, provided the promoters undertook to pay to the London County Council, for street improvements or other public purposes, such sum as Parliament should determine for the use of the land in the public streets for which no payment would otherwise be made. In adopting this proviso the Vestry were to some extent influenced by the precedent set in the construction of the Metropolitan and District Railways, when a sum of money was paid to the Chelsea Vestry for the purpose of street improvements, and streets were formed in the Parishes of Kensington and Hammersmith by the Companies concerned. The promoters did not agree to the above-named condition, consequently a petition has been deposited against the Bill, so that the Vestry may raise the point before the Parliamentary Committee, if, on full consideration, they deem it expedient to do so. H 114 CITY OF LONDON PAROCHIAL CHARITIES. The Vestry considered the scheme prepared by the Charity Commissioners under the provisions of the City of London Parochial Charities Act, 1883, and made representations thereon to the Commissioners, as follows:— The Yestry desire to point out:— 1.—That the right and proper administration of the Charitymost closely concerns the inhabitants within the area to be benefited, and the administration should therefore be vested in the inhabitants of such area through their duly elected representatives. 2.—That the area to be benefited is coterminous with the Metropolitan Police District, and includes the County of London and portions of the Counties of Surrey, Essex, Middlesex, and Kent. 3.—That under the Local Government Act, 1S88 (sec.79 (2) ). the duties and liabilities of the inhabitants of a County are transferred to the Council of such County. 4.—That the nomination by the London County Council of two Governors only out of a total of 21 is an inadequate representation of the inhabitants of the County of London. 5.—That the inhabitants of the Counties of Surrey, Middlesex, Essex, and Kent are not represented upon the Governing Body at all. 6.—That inasmuch as the nomination of five members of the Governing Body is vested in the Crown by the City of London Parochial Charities Act, 1883. the nomination of two members by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners is not necessary. 7.—That the University of London, University College, and King's College, are not representative bodies except in a very limited sense, and therefore are not entitled to direct representation upon the Governing Body. 8.—That the Governing Bodies of the Bishopsgate Foundation and of the Cripplegate Foundation, having their own funds to administer, are not entitled to direct representation upon the Governing Body dealing with the general fund, and do not need such representation, inasmuch as the Corporation of the City of London will nominate four members of the Governing Body, under the provisions of the Act. 115 The Vestry therefore most respectfully submit:— 1.—That the Governing Body should be representative in character, and that it should accordingly be constituted, in some such manner as follows:— To be nominated by the Crown (as provided by the Act) 5 By the Corporation of the City of London (as provided by the Act) 4 By the London County Council 6 By the School Board for London 2 By the Surrey County Council 1 By the Middlesex County Council 1 By the Essex County Council 1 By the Kent County Council 1 21 2.—That a detailed Scheme for administration should not now be established (except as to payments already settled by the Commissioners as compensation for existing interests or otherwise), but that it should be the duty of the Governing Body to frame a scheme within a specified time from the date of their appointment, such scheme to be considered and established (with or without amendments) by the Charity Commissioners. 3. —That as the constitution of the Governing Body and the framing of a scheme are of vital importance, involving the settlement of principles which will influence the administration of the Charity Fund for many years to come, further time should be afforded for the consideration thereof by the elected representatives of the inhabitants of the various districts of the Metropolis, either independently or in conference, and that the time for making objections or representations should be further enlarged to the end of January, 1890. The Yestry were subsequently informed by the Commissioners that it was intended to so far alter the constitution of the Governing Body as to admit of four of its members being elected by the County Council and two by the School Board for London, the election of the latter to be H 2 116 deferred until vacancies occur by the severance of the ecclesiastical portion from the general property of the Trust Fund, which it is anticipated will happen at no distant date. The Commissioners, however, have not modified their scheme in other respects, consequently little latitude will be allowed the new Governing Body in determining questions of principle, which, in the opinion of the Vestry, could have been better dealt with by a representative body than the Commissioners. FIRE PREVENTION. The communication from the Metropolitan Board of Works, to which reference was made in the last Annual Report, respecting the representations made by, the Vestry as to the adoption of certain measures by legislation or otherwise, for the prevention of fires, was carefully considered, together with other communications on the same subject, and the following Report of a Committee was adopted by the Vestry on the 11th April:— Your Committee having carefully considered the letter from the Metropolitan Board of Works relative to the Report of this Joint Committee on the subject of Fire Prevention, and communications from various local authorities in the Metropolis on the same subject, beg to report thereon as follows:— 1. The letter from the Metropolitan Board of Works covers much of the ground occupied by the Report of your Committee, but there are only four points which specially appear to require attention. These are (1) an increase in the strength of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade; (2) the desirability of entrusting the police with duplicate keys of the fire plugs; (3) the alteration and removal of obstructive posts in public streets, and (4) enquiring into the cause of fires, with a view to the discovery of incendiarism. 2. As regards the suggested increase in the effective strength of the Fire Brigade, especially in its application to the saving of life, your Committee observe that there appears to be a general consensus of opinion that some increase is necessary. It would 117 appeal, however, that the limit of the rate prescribed by the Fire Brigade Act has hitherto precluded this increase, and the question arises from what source the additional funds are to be drawn. The Fire Brigade has three sources of income, viz.: a contribution from Her Majesty's Treasury, a contribution from the Fire Insurance Offices, and the Rates. 3. In view of the fact that a further prevention of the destruction of property by fire would diminish the loss of the Fire Insurance Offices, your Committee concur in the views expressed by the Vestry of Islington and other local authorities to the effect that the Fire Insurance Companies should be required to contribute towards the additional expense incurred in increasing the efficiency of the Brigade. 4. Upon the second point, the Chief Officer of the Fire Brigade thinks that danger might result from placing the keys of fireplugs at the disposal of persons not acquainted with the water supply. Your Committee, however, would remark that the saving of even five minutes' time at the outbreak of a fire is frequently of the utmost importance, and may make all the difference between a small fire and one of considerable magnitude. They are necessarily ignorant of the danger which the Chief Officer contemplates, but they conceive little difficulty need be experienced in instructing selected officers or men of the Police Force in the use of the plugs and the general system of water supply for Fire Brigade purposes. Your Committee would therefore suggest that the London County Council be requested to further consider this question. 5. The alteration or removal of obstructive posts in the public streets, as suggested by the' Committee, the Metropolitan Board of Works consider would be an advantage. Your Committee accordingly recommend that the Vestry Clerk be instructed to communicate with the Sutton Estate Office on the subject of the posts at the western end of Vigo Street, with a view to their being removed altogether or replaced with a plain iron bar which would admit of being readily opened or removed if necessary for the passage of a Fire-Engine or Fire-Escape. (i. With regard to the suggested enquiry into the cause of fires involving the destruction of property exceeding £500 in value, your Committee recommend that the London County Council be asked to introduce a Bill into Parliament upon the same lines as 118 the City of London Fire Inquests Act, 1888, and that the other Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis be invited to support this representation to the County Council. 7. Your Committee observe that the communication from the Metropolitan Board of Works contains no reference to the suggested amendment of the Metropolitan Building Acts. They accordingly recommend that the attention of the London County Council should be directed to the importance of this subject, with a view to amending legislation being brought forward at the earliest opportunity. The amendments should be especially directed to the following points:— (a) Securing the official inspection and approval by some Public Authority, such as the London County Council, of the plans of all new buildings before the erection of the buildings is commenced, with a view especially to the prevention of fire. (b) More strictly limiting the area, or floor space, of any room used for manufacturing or business purposes, or providing for a complete subdivision of large rooms during closing hours, so that should an outbreak of fire occur it might be restricted to very narrow limits and thus the more easily dealt with. (c) Providing some efficient means of escape from every floor upon which there are rooms used for dwelling purposes. (d) Proprietors of all large buildings, especially where there are a number of persons living on the premises (including Artizans' Dwellings) to be further subject (as suggested by the Vestry of Newington), to a requirement to provide all needful appliances for escape in case of fire, adapted to the particular circumstances of the case, and kept under due inspection. And your Committee report accordingly. With reference to paragraph 5 of the foregoing Report, a reply was received from the agent of Sir R. F. Sutton, stating that Sir Richard regretted to be obliged to object to the removal or alteration of the posts in Vigo Street, as suggested, as lessees upon the Sutton Estates as well as other residents in the vicinity had requested him not to 119 consent thereto, in consequence of the western end of Vigo Street being too narrow to admit of vehicular traffic. The Vestry thereupon suggested to the County Council the desirability of powers being sought from Parliament for the compulsory removal of obstructive posts, in such cases as the Local Authority may deem it advisable, and the Council replied that the subject was under consideration. OBSTRUCTIONS TO TRAFFIC. Complaints have been received during the year of the obstruction to pedestrian traffic caused by public vehicles standing in Piccadilly, close to the Circus, to set down and take up passengers. The Vestry have called the attention of the Police to the matter, and suggested that the vacant paved space at the entrance to Shaftesbury Avenue might be used for omnibuses going east as a place for setting down and taking up passengers, and that vehicles going west might be required to draw up in front of the Geological Museum and the Church, and thus in some degree reduce the pressure at the Circus. The Police, however, have not seen their way to adopt this suggestion. Another source of complaint is the almost continuous delivery and collection of parcels and goods at the Railway Receiving Houses in Regent Street. To meet this difficulty the Vestry suggested to the London County Council and to the Government the advisability of extending the provisions of the Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867, so as to further restrict the delivery of goods in specified streets. 120 In view, however, of the convenience which the Receiving Houses afford to the public, it has not been deemed expedient to seek any amendment of the existing law in the direction indicated. PAYMENT OF SALARY TO DEPUTY-CHAIRMAN OF LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. In common with many other Local Authorities, the Yestry expressed their disapproval of the assignment of a salary to the Deputy-Chairman of the London County Council. Mr. Firth was. however, appointed DeputyChairman with a salary of £2,000 a year. On the occurrence of a vacancy in the office, caused by the death of Mr. Firth, the salary was reduced to £1,500 a year. GOLDEN SQUARE GARDEN. A deputation of ratepayers in Golden Square waited upon the Yestry in the month of February, and asked the Vestry either themselves to take over the management of the Square Garden, or to assist in transferring the same from the present body of Trustees to a Committee elected by the residents. The garden is vested in Trustees under an Act of Parliament (7 and 8 Geo. IV., cap. xliv.) New Trustees are appointed, as occasion requires, by the surviving members of the body, and residents in the Square have no voice in their election. The Trustees are empowered to levy a rate not to exceed 3s. in the pound, but are not required by the Act to submit any statement of accounts to the persons liable to this special rate. When the Act was passed the Trustees were constituted the Authority for maintaining the garden and railings, for 121 paving the carriageway and footways outside the enclosure, and for lighting, scavenging, dust removal, and certain police purposes in Golden Square. Subsequent public legislation has either divested the Trustees of most of these powers or rendered the exercise of them unnecessary, leaving the control and management of the garden the sole duty necessarily to be discharged by the Trustees. The 239th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act appears to have been framed to meet just such a case, as it expressly continues bodies of Trustees for the management of enclosures, notwithstanding the Act divests them of other functions, and as the deputation referred to specifically objected to the garden being thrown open to the public, the only hope of relief the Vestry could hold out was the possibility of the Government or the County Council introducing in some public Bill a clause to repeal the local Act of Parliament. CONCLUDING REMARKS. The Vestry have not attempted in the foregoing Report to touch upon mere routine business requiring attention from day to day, but have endeavoured to submit to their fellow-parishioners, in as clear and succinct a manner as possible, a statement of the principles which have guided them in the discharge of their trust, and particulars of thepresent condition of the Pasish. By Order, HARRY WILKTNS, Vestry Clerk. 123 Supplemental Report of Works EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER, DURING THE YEAR 1889—90. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, W. Surveyor's Department. June, 1890. To the Vestry of St. James, Westminster Rev. Sir, My Lord, and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the following statement of Works executed between the 26th March, 1889, and the 25th March, 1890. ROADS. During the past year 3385/8 tons of granite, supplied by Messrs. J. Mowlem and Co., of Westminster, were used upon the parish roads. 124 Twenty-two thousand three hundred and eleven superficial yards of road surface have been rolled and consolidated by the 8-ton steam roller and the 4-horse roller.

In Great Marlborough Street the consumption of gas in five lamps was increased from 5 to 7 feet per hour, one lamp was removed entirely from opposite the Prince's Hall, Piccadilly, and one from the centre of Arundell Street, Three new lamps were put up in Arundell Street and one in Blue Ball Yard, and the position of one lamp was altered in each of the following streets, viz.:—Blue Ball Yard, Ganton Street, George Court, and Arundell Street. The refuge lamps are furnished with a "midnight arrangement," and a man is employed by your Vestry to light, extinguish, and clean these lamps and those in the urinals, and also to reduce the light at 12 o'clock at night. SEWERS. The small defective brick sewer in the Haymarket between Jermyn Street and Norris Street, and that running through No. 155, Regent Street, were destroyed, and pipes substituted—12 inch being used in the former case and 9 inch in the latter. Repairs were also carried out to the sewers in Charles Street, Cork Street, and Rupert Court. A length of old disused brick sewer, which was discovered in Piccadilly opposite the Vestry Hall, was destroyed. Complaints having been received of the smells arising from the sewer ventilators at the upper end of St. James's Place and at the Beak Street end of King Street, and from the gullies in Golden Square, and consents having been obtained, 131 iron ventilating pipes were carried from the sewers up the side of No. 22, St. James's Place and the fronts of No. 15, Beak Street and Nos. 2 and 11, Golden Square, above the roofs, and the old ventilators destroyed. Several of the small subsidiary sewers running under the vaults of the houses in Regent Street have been partially blocked. In each case the stoppage was removed, and where found necessary the old barrel drain destroyed and earthenware pipes substituted. The cost of repairing sewers, bricking up old disused drains, new side entrance covers, manholes, &c., amounted to the sum of £101 19s. 0½d. for the year. GULLIES. Twenty-nine gullies have been reconstructed at a cost of £99 7s. 4½d. They are situate as follows :— Babmaes Mews 3 Bentinck Street 3 Blue Ball Yard 3 Bury Street 1 Coventry Street 1 Edward Street 2 Glasshouse Street 4 Golden Square 1 Great Pulteney Street 1 Green's Court 1 Mason's Yard 1 Naylor's Yard 2 Portland Mews 4 Wardour Mews 2 29 132 CLEANSING- SEWERS AND GULLIES. The cost of labour for cleansing the sewers was £79 19s. 6d., and for emptying 1,748 gullies, £63 17s. 2d., the accumulations removed from the sewers and gullies being carted away by the slopping contractor, under his contract, without extra expense. CONNECTIONS TO SEWERS. Thirty-five new connections from houses have been made to the sewers by men in the employ of your Vestry. EXAMINING OUTLETS TO DRAINS. Examinations of outlets of drains have been made in twelve cases. The fee for each examination is five shillings. FLUSHING. The small sewers and courts were flushed at intervals during the hot weather as found necessary. The cost of water was £121 10s.; labour, £11 8s. 2d.; and hose, hose reel and tools, £21 13s. 5d. DISINFECTING. The gullies and market streets were regularly disinfected during the summer months. The disinfectants used for all purposes amounted to 449 gallons of carbolic acid, and 12 cwt. 6 qrs. 18 lbs. of chloride of lime, costing £20 l1s. 7d, URINALS. The saving of water at the Urinals throughout the Parish has been very great in consequence of the general adoption of 133 the trough system. Excluding the Conveniences at Piccadilly Circus, the water has cost £48 8s. this year, whereas last year it was £113 2s. 4d. A constant supply of water is now laid on to all the Urinals in the parish except one, and the automatic apparatus belonging to the latter is worked from a tank fixed above the urinal, which is filled daily from the Water Company's mains. The Urinals in Mason's Yard and Cork Mews have been reconstructed, the cost of reconstruction, alterations to the urinals generally, repairs and cleansing being £175 6s. 6d. The repairs are principally making good damage caused by persons unknown. MACHINE BROOMS. The machine brooms required re-filling with new bass on the average once in six weeks. The cost of sundry repairs, re-fillings, hand brooms and brushes for Orderly Boys, amounted to the sum of £103 0s. 6d. WATERING. The street watering throughout the year was carried out by Mr. William Mead, of Paddington, at a schedule of prices. The water is supplied by the Grand Junction Water Works Company by contract. STAND POSTS. The cost of repacking the stand posts and executing sundry repairs was £24 4s. 4d. 134 ORDERLY BOYS. There are now fifteen Orderly Boys at work in the main thoroughfares, under the direction of a Foreman. It is a difficult matter to keep them constantly at their duties, but nevertheless they pick up a large quantity of horse droppings in the course of the day which would otherwise be carried all over the streets. Bins for the reception of the horse droppings are fixed in the streets at suitable places for their use. SNOW. The snow which fell on the morning of the 7th of December was thawed by the use of eight tons of salt, the streets being subsequently swept in the afternoon in the ordinary manner. DUSTING AND SLOPPING. The contract for dusting and slopping was carried out by Mr. William Mead, of Paddington, at a cost of £4,500. I am, Rev.

Report upon Articles Analyzed during year 1888 204 179 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, for the year 1889. The Census of 1881 gives the District of the Parish of St. James's as covering an area of 162 acres, and containing a population of 29,865. The Golden Square Sub.District appears as covering an area of 54 acres, and containing a population of 11,585. The Berwick Street Sub.District appears as covering an area of 108 acres, and containing a population of 18,280. Taking these data from the Census, the mean density of the population of the whole District appears as 184 per acre, while the density of the population of the Golden Square m 2 180 Sub.District appears as 215 persons per acre, and that of the Berwick Street Sub.District as 169 persons per acre. During the year 1889 the death.rate of Registration London has been 17.4 per 1,000; the death.rate of Greater London has been 16.8 per 1,000; the death.rate of England and Wales has been 17.9 per 1,000. The net mortality for the Parish of St. James during the year 1889 was 314 deaths. Taking the population at 29,865—314 deaths gives a death.rate of 10.51 per 1,000. The mortality from Zymotic diseases during the year 1889 has been 34. Of Fever and Diphtheria, 76 cases came under notice during the year. Of these 76 cases, 2 were Diphtheria, 13 were Typhoid Fever, and 59 were Scarlet Fever, 1 was Puerperal Fever, and 1 was returned as "Continued Fever." There was also 1 case of Small.pox. Of these 76 cases, 61 were removed out of the Parish, 59 to extra Parochial Fever or other Hospitals, 2 to their own homes; 15 of the 76 cases were not removed. Besides the above, one case of Group and two of Erysipelas came under notice. During the year 1889, 30 bodies were removed into the Mortuary. several cases bodies were removed from the presence of families generally living in a single room, and * where, but for the Public Mortuary, the family would have lived and slept in the presence of a decomposing corpse, upon which, possibly, a post.mortem would have had to be made before the interment could take place. In 2 cases the bodies have been removed from hotels or lodging.houses. Twelve inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 10 post.mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in the Examination Room which adjoins the Mortuary. 181 The following numbers of Deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's during the year 1889:— First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Gross mortality for year 1889 Deduct deaths of Non.Parishioners:— Dying in the Workhouse 44 Dying in the Throat Hospital 15 59 Net mortality for the year 1889 314 For a population of 29,865, 314 deaths is a death.rate of 10.51 for each 1,000 persons living in the parish. The net mortality and death.rate of St. James's have been continuously decreasing. These facts, for the last ten years, are shown in the following table, but, until we have a new Census, it is difficult to know what changes have taken place in the population of St. James's since the Census of 1881:— Gross Net Deaths Mortality. Mortality, per 1,000. Year 1880 Deaths 623 589 17.60 „ 1881 „ 569 545 18.22 „ 1882 „ 538 505 17.00 „ 1883 „ 527 501 16.80 „ 1884 „ 486 476 15.94 „ 1885 „ 476 451 15.10 „ 1886 „ 493 450 15.07 „ 1887 „ 463 426 14.26 „ 1888 „ 427 386 12.96 „ 1889 „ 373 314 10.51 109 111 76 77 373 182 The new Act for the Notification of Infectious Diseases came into action in every London district on the 30th October, 1889. The Act has worked perfectly, and is a great advance in Sanitary Legislation. Under this Act all cases of Infectious Disease, other than those in a hospital for the reception of Infectious Disease, must be notified forthwith to the Medical Officer of Health. "Infectious Disease" is defined as including Small.pox, Cholera, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Erysipelas, the disease known as Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever, and the Fevers known by any of the following names:—Typhus, Typhoid, Enteric, Relapsing, Continued, or Puerperal. It also includes, as respects any particular district, any other Infectious Disease to which this Act has been applied by a special resolution of the Sanitary Authority—such special resolution having been approved of by the Local Government Board. The provisions of this Act over.ride those which may be in force for a like purpose under any local Act. The duty of notification is cast by the Act on the head of the family or other lay representative of the sick person. It is also cast upon the Medical Practitioner in attendance upon the patient. The duty of notifying is not upon one or the other, but upon each, and therefore the Medical Attendant is bound to send his certificate to the Medical Officer of Health in all cases that may come under his care. Upon the Medical Officer of Health is cast the duty of forwarding to the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums District copies of all such certificates within twelve hours of their receipt. 183 Upon the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums District is cast the duty of forwarding to the London County Council a weekly return of all such certificates. Crown Buildings or Properties are not subject to the operation of the Act, and therefore cases of Infectious Disease occurring in Marlborough House or St. James's Palace would not become known to the Medical Officer of Health for St. James's. The Act has thrown a considerable amount of extra work upon Medical Officers of Health and upon the local Sanitary Departments generally. It would be an advantage if all such notices were transmitted free by post. Some of the notices that reach me come chargeable with double postage, in consequence of the senders not knowing that a penny stamp has to be affixed to each notice that is sent to me by post. In some cases I find that I receive duplicate medical certificates for the same case. If a child, for instance, is taken to a Dispensary and diagnosed as suffering from Scarlet Fever, the Medical Officer of the Dispensary sends on his certificate. If the child be laid up at home, and the family doctor is called in, he also sends on a certificate. There is one gap in the Act. In the case of a child having mild Scarlet Fever, and no doctor being called in, it is the duty of the father to notify the case to the Medical Officer of Health. But under Sec. 10 the duty of forwarding information to the Metropolitan Asylums Board is restricted to cases in which the certificate of a Medical Practitioner has 184 been received, and such cases therefore do not come into account in the weekly statements made by the Asylums Board to the London County Council. Upon the front page, and in the side-note to Sec. 4, the words "Several Medical Practitioners" appears to have been inserted where the Act should read "several Medical Officers of Health." Section 3 provides that the Act takes effect where an inmate of any building is suffering from an Infectious Disease, unless such building is a hospital in which persons suffering from an Infectious Disease are received. Here the words should be:— Unless such building is a hospital in which persons suffering from such Infectious Disease are received. The repetition in the Act of the word an, which means any, would permit of a patient attacked with Scarlet Fever, say, remaining in a hospital occupied with Small.pox patients, or vice versa. This cannot have been the intention of the Act. 3 (a) The duty of notifiying is cast upon the patient's guardian as well as upon the Medical Attendant. In point of fact, the guardian but rarely notifies to me, and it seems not to be necessary. Cases visiting a Hospital in St. James's as mere outpatients, coming say from Brighton or from Spitalfields and returning home immediately, have been reported to me. It seems to me that the registration of such cases would falsify the returns for St. James's, and that such certificates should be sent to the Medical Officer of Health for the District in which the patients are "inmates of the building." 185 The following Table of gross Mortality shows the periods of life in which the deaths have occurred in the last Seven years respectively.

EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P., Load., F.R.M.S., F.C.S., (Sc., Medical Officer cf Health ancl Public Analyst for St. James's, Westminster. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen,— During the year 1889, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, 59 samples were examined, all which were procured for examination by the Vestry Officers. It will be seen that one specimen of Coffee was loaded with chicory, but, it being labelled "Sold as a Mixture" the Vendor was not punishable. In two other samples small quantities of chicory or other matters were found, but were regarded as accidental. Among the Milks, one sample contained 26 per cent, of added water, and a fine of 20s. and costs followed. Two other samples of Milk were "poor milk," but not below the standard then acted upon for prosecutions. For the future this standard is, with the sanction of the Sanitary Committee and the Vestry, raised from 11 per cent, of dry milk solids to 11.5 per cent. In none of the samples was any poisonous ingredient discovered. No money or consideration other than the stipend paid by the Vestry has been received by me in connection with these analyses. I have the honour to remain, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 8, Grafton Street, Piccadilly. 205 Samples of Food submitted for Examination during the Year 1889.
