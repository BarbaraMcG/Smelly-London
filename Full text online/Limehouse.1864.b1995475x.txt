NEW RAILWAYS, AND PROPOSED RAILWAY AND DOCK EXTENSIONS. The Railway Bridge over East Smithfield, Wapping, has been completed, and the street under the same widened to 40 feet, according to the ' clause in the Act of Parliament. Plans have been deposited and notices served by the promoters in reference to properties and public ways to be affected by the proposed schemes within the Limehouse district. 39 Regents Canal Company.—Enlargement and improvement of the present Basin, and construction of a new ship entrance and other works. As this scheme would affect the public ways to a serious extent, negociations were entered into with the Company for the purpose of providing additional accommodation for the traffic, and as they refused to agree to the requisitions made by the Board, the scheme is now being opposed in Parliament. East London Railway : Thames Tunnel Line.—Construction of a new line through part of Wapping and Shadwell, with a branch line from Rhodeswell Road, Limehouse, to Stepney Station, and thence along the Commercial Road, Ratcliff. The necessary clauses have been agreed with the promoters of this scheme, as regards the main line of railway, and they will be inserted in the Bill. In regard to the branch line, as the construction of the same would seriously affect valuable property and interests in the district, requisitions were made to the promoters to protect the same, as far as possible; and an alternative was suggested which would remove many of the objections to the branch line, as shown in the deposit plans, and the promoters in consequence, after due consideration, determined to abandon the said branch line. Metropolitan and South London.—Construction of a new line through part of Shadwell and Wapping, with a branch from Salmon's Lane, Limehouse, to Hardinge Street, Ratcliff This scheme has been withdrawn.
