Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Another year having expired, I have the pleasure of presenting to you the several statistical tables recording the number of Births and Deaths which have occurred in our Parish for the year 1881—2, and such other sanitary information as becomes my duty as your Health Officer. During the year 2,214 children were born and registered. Of these 1,145 were males, and 1,069 females. The Deaths were, of males 633, females 643, giving a total of 1276. The Deaths of females exceeded that of males by 10. The Births were 9 less than the previous year, and 938 in excess of Deaths. The Deaths were 16 below the average of the last ten years, but 20 more than last year. The Death rate has therefore been 21. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1881—2. 11 TABLE No. 1.

Quarter ending June 561 268 Quarter ending September 506 310 Quarter ending December 589 320 Quarter ending March 558 380 Taking the several quarters, the greatest number of deaths occurred in the fourth quarter. This is accounted for by an epidemic of Whooping cough which proved fatal to 52 children, all under five years. This disease assumed an epidemic character in London at the close of last year, and has prevailed with exceptional fatality, for during the first thirteen weeks of this year 2224 Deaths from this cause were registered in London.

How many of these have died I am unable to say. Such isolation should be regarded as a necessary part of the preventive treatment of this most loathsome disease; but although the removal of these cases is important as preventing its extension, we must not lose sight of the fact that our hope of preventing recurring epidemics must rest upon the success of our efforts in promoting vaccination and re-vaccination. Scarlatina is slightly below that of last year.

Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1881—2. 15 Of those who died, 394 were under one year, 422 under five, and 46 from twenty to ighty. One Death was recorded of a female at Cleghorn Cottages, whose age was stated to ie 100t 95 Inquests have been held during the year; and since my last report, a room for holding Inquests, at New Alley, has been opened, which the Coroner much appreciated, and at the first Inquest expressed his thanks to the Yestry for having granted a proper coom in which to hold his court, so as to obviate the necessity of holding Inquests at mblic houses. Since the opening, September 8th, 79 Inquests have been held, and £18 17s. has been received for its use. £18 14s. has been paid to Mr. Burridge for removing bodies to the Mortuary upon the Coroner's Order, according to an arrangement made by the Yestry. 180 Bodies have been removed to the Mortuary, and 24 Post Mortems have been held Professor Franldand reports that the Water during the year has been of fairly good quality, but in December/was much polluted with organic matter. Although the early part of the first quarter was cold, the mean temperature was 52°. In the second quarter the mean temperature was above the average, and on the 5th of July was 140-8 above the average, and the mean daily excess of five days was 8° 8October brought cold winds, and was the coldest recorded for the last 40 years, and on the 14th the barometer fell rapidly, succeeded by a disastrous gale. The two following months were warm, but with heavy fogs. The mean temperature of the quarter was 44° 6. In the fourth quarter the mean temperature was 42° •. The 1st and 4th of February will be memorable for the dense fogs which enveloped London; but the remainder of the quarter was mild and pleasant. The amount of rain has been about four inches below the average. Forty-one thousand persons have made use of the three paying Closets in St. George's Road, and about twenty thousand the free one, showing that the erection of these conveniences has been a great boon to the public, and I have no doubt, if more were established, they would be very serviceable. The Slaughter and Cow Houses have been regularly inspected. 16 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwarh. 1881 and 1882. LIST OF BEDDING DISINFECTED IN THE APPARATUS.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, In submitting my Twelfth Annual Report for your consideration, I beg respectfully to draw your attention to the improved condition of the Parish, as to its Roadways and Footways, as compared with five years ago, without an increase in the rates. The Carriageway of the Borough High Street, which has been kept in repair by our workmen during the past three years, will however; require your consideration as to re-paving at an early date; the Paving is so much worn, that further repair is a useless expense, and re-paving with new material has now become necessary; utilizing the old material so taken up in the side streets, where it is much needed. You will doubtless give your directions on this subject in due course. I have also specially to recommend that arrangements should be at once made to provide a quantity of Old Paying for the repair of Footways of our side streets. This could most economically be done by repairing the western side of the Footway, London Road, with new material. This is a work which cannot much longer be delayed under any circumstances. The old paving taken up to be used for the repair of the Footways in the side streets. Surveyor's Annual Report. 23 THE FOLLOWING WORKS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED IN THE ROADS DEPARTMENT. New York Paying laid in Footways 1640 square yards. Old Granite Cubes dressed and relaid in Carriageways and 570 square yards. Old Channels relaid 340 square yards. New Broken Guernsey Granite in Roadways 2108 cubic yards. Steam Roller 97 J days. Openings in Public ways by Gas & Water Companies, and repaired... 1266 Licenses to erect Hoards 52 Courts and Alleys, not being public thoroughfares, Paved at the cost of the Owners 7 SCAVENGING, WATERING, AND REMOVING OF DUST DEPARTMENT.
