Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, The health of the district during 1954 has remained good ; there have been no epidemics of any size and in fact the incidence of most infectious diseases apart from dysentery has shown a marked decrease from that of last year. It is a matter of opinion whether there is any connection between this decrease and the prevailing weather conditions. There were only a few weeks of severe cold early in the year, and the summer was dull and cool, but the later months were extremely mild. The marked rise in notifications of dysentery was not due to any particular outbreak, but arose from an accumulation of isolated cases, none of which was serious. The vital statistics are satisfactory, both the birth rate of 13.54 and the death rate of 10.71 comparing favourably with the figures for England and Wales. There were no maternal deaths this year. Much new legislation concerning public health has been brought forward in Parliament during the year, and foreshadows an increase in the amount and scope of the work of this department. From this point of view, the most important was the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954i This is designed to improve the general standard of housing accommodation throughout the country. To this end, local authorities are encouraged to proceed with slum clearance programmes and to complete these within the next five years, where at all practicable. Facilities are offered for "Patching" of some dwellings in order to defer demolition and to render them habitable for a reasonable length of time ; this is of course only an interim measure. New standards of fitness for human habitation have been laid down, and these are designed to cover and supersede previous regulations and byelaws. In order to encourage property owners to improve the standards of housing, amendments have been made to the conditions attached to the payment of grants for improvement and conversion. The 2 upper limit of cost has been removed and the lower limit decreased to £100, grants of up to 50 per cent, of the admissible cost being payable by the local authority, subject to a maximum of £400. In addition, the qualifying period for which the dwelling must be expected to provide satisfactory accommodation has been reduced from 30 years to 15 years. Provision is also made for the Council to fix for such dwellings a maximum rent in keeping with presentday values. Already in this district three applications for grants have been received this year. As a result of the disastrous London fog of December, 1952, a committee under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Beaver was set up to enquire into atmospheric pollution. The report of this Committee, known as the Beaver Report, was published in November, 1954, and has been the cause of much controversy ; in view of this, it would be well to review the facts : 1. Atmospheric pollution is the cause of a considerable number of deaths and of chronic ill-health. 2. The most important factors concerned are particles of grit and carbonaceous matter, and oxides of sulphur. Of these, the first two may be largely eliminated by the use of smokeless fuels and of complete combustion of all fuels. The oxides of sulphur are not so readily disposed of, and at the present time there are no easy practicable means of doing so. Sooty particles, however, form a base on which these oxides can condense, and thus render them more dangerous. As smokeless fuels do not give off more oxides of sulphur than their sooty counterparts, it seems reasonable to press for their wider use in an attempt to alleviate if not to solve altogether, the problem of atmospheric pollution. Clean water is now looked upon as a necessity of life, and is paid for willingly ; would it not be well to regard clean air in the same way ? In presenting this report I would like to thank the members of the Council, particularly the Public Health Committee, for their continued support, and the staff of the Public Health Department for the loyal and unstinting way in which they have carried out their duties. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, V. SHAW, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5,159 Population (Census) 65,608 Population (mid-year 1954—Registrar General's estimate of civilian population) 64,960 Number of inhabited houses as at 31st December, 1954 18,059 Rateable value (estimated) as at 31st December, 1954 £469,150 Product of a penny rate £1,859 4 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR Live Births : M.

Hospitals. Hayes Cottage Hospital, Grange Road, Hayes, Harlington Cottage Hospital, Sipson Lane, Harlington, for maternity cases. Hillingdon Hospital, near Uxbridge. St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, for infectious diseases. Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford, for cases of smallpox. Ambulance Service. Motor ambulances are provided by the Middlesex County Council. One of these is garaged at Hayes and others are available from Hillingdon Hospital. Tuberculosis. Provision is made by the Middlesex County Council for treating cases of tuberculosis at South Mimms Hospital, Harefield Hospital, and other places. The Chest Clinic is situated at the Local County Offices, High Street, Uxbridge. Fewer cases of pulmonary tuberculosis occurred in 1954 than in 1953 ; the number of non-pulmonary cases was the same. Child Welfare Clinics, etc. There are numerous Maternity and Child Welfare Clinics in the district; these are administered by the Middlesex County Council and the services provided are available free of charge. Sessions are held regularly in clinic buildings and certain church halls ; the mobile clinic now visits three districts in the area which are a long way from established clinics. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES The incidence of infectious diseases in the district is analysed in the following table. The numbers are small, and centre largely on the younger school population, as one might expect. 6 ANALYSIS OF TOTAL CASES Disease AT AGES Under 1 year 1—2 3—4 5—9 10—14 15—24 25 and over Age unknown Totals Scarlet Fever 1 4 9 24 9 1 3 1 52 Whooping Cough 8 11 22 30 — — 2 - 73 Acute Poliomyelitis — — — 1 — — — — 1 Measles 2 12 19 39 — — — 3 75 Disease AT AGES Under 5 years 5—14 15—44 45—64 65 and over Age unknown Totals Acute Pneumonia 6 10 9 7 7 3 42 Dysentery 2 6 2 1 1 12 Erysipelas — — 2 3 2 1 8 Food Poisoning 1 — — — — — 1 Puerperal Pyrexia - - 6 - - - 6 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES (OTHER THAN TUBERCULOSIS) DURING THE YEAR 1954 Disease Confirmed cases notified Deaths Scarlet Fever 52 - Pneumonia 42 13 Puerperal Pyrexia 6 - Erysipelas 8 — Measles 75 - Whooping Cough 73 — Dysentery 12 — Acute Poliomyelitis and Encephalitis 1 — Food Poisoning 1 - TUBERCULOSIS New cases and mortality during the year 1954.

Immunisation against diphtheria and whooping cough, and vaccination of infants against smallpox are available without cost at the County Council's clinics. Most parents gladly take advantage of the facilities offered, but there still remains a section who, for various reasons, deny their children protection against these diseases. Although there have been fewer cases of diphtheria in the country for some years, the danger still exists and it would be foolish to ignore it. The Area Medical Officer, Area No. 8, has kindly supplied figures showing immunisation and vaccination carried out in the district during 1954 ; these are given below : IMMUNISATION AND VACCINATION CARRIED OUT DURING 1954 Age at date of completion of course Children who completed a full course of primary immunisation Children given a reinforcing injection against Diphtheria only Combined Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Whooping Cough only Diphtheria only Combined Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Whooping Cough only (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Under 1 60 431 3 — — — 1-4 69 334 19 66 51 4 5-9 41 12 12 462 135 4 10-14 6 — — 320 1 — Total 176 777 34 848 187 8 PERSONS VACCINATED OR RE-VACCINATED Age at date of completion of course Vaccination Re-vaccination (1) (2) (3) Under 1 429 — 1-4 64 7 5-14 47 53 15 and over 44 219 Total 584 279 9 Poliomyelitis. Only one case of poliomyelitis was notified in this district; this was of the non-paralytic variety. The incidence of the disease in the country as a whole was much below that of recent years, possibly owing to the average low temperature experienced during the summer months. Scabies. Scabies is no longer a notifiable disease. A few cases occur and these are treated by the family doctor, or sometimes by the School Health Services. WATER SUPPLY An abundant supply of water is available in the district; the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company supply the greater part of the district, while a small area at the southern extremity of the district is supplied by the South Western Suburban Water Company. Owing to the recommencement of the Council's programme of demolition of unfit houses, only fourteen dwelling houses (0.08% of the total for the district) are now supplied from stand-pipes. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS OF COUNCIL STAFF The total number of examinations carried out during 1954 was 198. Of these 70 were for superannuation purposes, 106 for admission to the Council's Sick Pay Scheme and 22 for various special purposes. 10 REPORT OF THE CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR In recent years some of the many difficulties which beset Sanitary Inspectors during the war and immediate post-war years have eased considerably; building materials and labour for house repairs or improvements to food preparing premises have become more easily available, the clearance of unfit houses and the repair of dilapidated houses has become possible, facilities have been provided for the improvement and modernisation of old houses and the impact upon the public of the London fog disaster of 1952 has paved the way for more effective means of action against atmospheric pollution. These improvements gave rise to the hope that it would soon be possible to carry out sanitary inspection in the widest sense of the term and it is with regret therefore that I have to report that the shortage of inspectorial staff during the major part of the year, coupled with an increase of work arising from the decontrol of meat supplies and from the implementation of the Housing Rent and Repairs Act, 1954, have prevented the fulfilment of this hope. The year under review is therefore one of " marking time " rather than of progress and we look forward eagerly to the time when it will be possible to recruit a full staff and carry out sanitary inspection in such a way that will give satisfaction to the public and the Council as well as pride to ourselves. Four events of outstanding importance occurred during the year. In May, the Council agreed to embark on a five-year programme for the clearance of unfit houses and subsequently 27 houses were dealt with. In Jul}', meat supplies were decontrolled and, after an interval of fourteen years, private slaughter-houses were again brought into regular use in this district. The Housing Repairs and Rents Act came into force in August; one of the major objects of this measure was to ease the financial burden of landlords by permitting them, under certain conditions, to increase rents and enable them to carry out repairs and prevent the decay of existing houses. Experience to date indicates that the Act will have no effect on those houses most in need of repair, i.e., the old and neglected ones. In November, the final report of the Beaver Committee on Air Pollution was published and gave much encouragement to all who regard this as one of the most pressing public health problems of the day and indicated that it is, at last, being treated seriously. The following report on the work of the Sanitary Inspectors is set out under four headings: (1) Sanitary Administration—including inspection of the district, complaints, notices served, legal proceedings, offensive trades, atmospheric pollution, drainage, keeping of animals, rodent control. 11 (2) Food—including milk supply, ice cream, inspection of meat and other foods, food handling byelaws, clean food campaign, hawkers of food, sampling of foods and drugs, food poisoning, inspection of food premises. (3) Housing—including overcrowding, Improvement Grants, Certificates of Disrepair, moveable dwellings. (4) Factories and Shops—including outworkers. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN S. HODGINS, Chief Sanitary Inspector. PART 1. SANITARY ADMINISTRATION. Inspection of the District.

During the year 1,499 complaints were received with respect to the following matters : Choked and defective drains 306 Insanitary or dilapidated conditions of houses or premises 240 Offensive accumulations or deposits 20 Defective dustbins 428 Vermin or insects 71 Gypsies 5 Rat and mouse infestations 266 Unsound food 20 Nuisances from animals 13 Overcrowding 37 Dust, smoke and noise nuisances 24 Other nuisances 69 Total 1,499 Notices Served. Informal Notices served 1,003 Statutory Notices served : Public Health Act, 1936, Section 39 8 do. Section 45 6 do. Section 75 17 do. Section 93 27 Legal Proceedings. (a) Public Health Act, 1936. Three summonses were taken out for failure to comply with Abatement Notices. In each case the requirements of the Notice were carried out before the hearing took place. The summonses were therefore withdrawn on payment of costs. (b) Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Proceedings were taken on one occasion in connection with foreign matter in food. A fine of £10 with £3. 3s. Od. costs was imposed by the Magistrates. (c) Middlesex County Council Acts, 1944-1950. Successful action was taken against the owner and the occupier of an unauthorised caravan site. Fines of £1 and 10/- respectively were imposed. 13 Offensive Trades. There is no establishment in the district carrying on an offensive trade. Prevention of Atmospheric Pollution. In the absence of proper recording instruments it is difficult to assess whether or not progress is being made in reducing the amount of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere. It is hoped that this omission will have been remedied before the next report is prepared. No contraventions of the Byelaws were noted as a result of observations on factory chimneys. There were, however, many occasions when the emission of smoke was in excess of the amount which need be caused by a well run plant. On such occasions discussions took place with the management of the factories concerned, often leading to improved operation of the plant. The publication during the year of the Beaver Report caused great public interest, and it appears that Local Authorities will at last be given adequate powers to deal effectively with this public health menace. The extent to which these new powers are used will be a measure of the enthusiasm prevailing in any particular district for this subject. The most important of the Committee's recommendations are : (a) the prohibition, with certain exceptions, of "dark" smoke; present legislation frowns only on "black" smoke. (b) strengthening of the law to control smoke from railways. (c) simplification of the procedure for establishing smokeless zones or smoke control areas. (d) all heating appliances installed in new dwellings to be of approved types. (.e) sulphur to be removed from the flue gases of all new power stations in or near populated areas. From a practical point of view one of the Committee's proposals causes us some misgivings. That is the suggestion that the limit of dark smoke should be six minutes in four hours in place of the present limit of two minutes black smoke in half an hour. Apart from the staffing difficulties this will produce, the prospect of watching a factory chimney for a continuous period of four hours will undoubtedly cause some dismay among Sanitary Inspectors. 14 Drainage. At the end of the year there were sixty-nine cesspools and fifty-seven pail closets in the district. These numbers are respectively seven and fourteen less than at the beginning of the year, the reduction having been achieved mainly by the demolition of unfit houses. In an effort to expedite the abolition of cesspools the Council have agreed to make a contribution towards the cost of connecting the drains from these premises to the sewer and negotiations with the owners concerned are now in progress. Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer & Surveyor's Department. The practice of clearing stopped drains free of charge has now been in operation for five years and has reduced to a minimum nuisances from this cause. Keeping of Animals. Byelaws under Section 81 of the Public Health Act to control the keeping of pigs, horses and cattle were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in January and came into operation on the 1st February. The byelaws deal with the structural condition and cleanliness of premises in which these animals are kept, the storage of manure, boiling of swill, drainage, etc., and have proved of considerable assistance to the Sanitary Inspectors in their efforts to minimise nuisances from this source. In view of the suspicion which has fallen on flies in the spread of poliomyelitis these additional powers of coutrol over premises which are particularly liable to infestation are useful and necessary. Rodent Control. One whole-time and one part-time rodent operator are employed. Treatment is carried out in accordance with the methods suggested by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. A charge to cover labour and cost of materials is made for work done in business premises but all treatment at dwelling houses is free. During the year 605 treatments were carried out at dwelling houses and 218 at business premises, and also many ditches, undeveloped sites, etc., were treated. The use of "Warfarin" as a poison has been continued on an increased scale and its value as an alternative to the older poisons fully confirmed. PART II. FOOD Milk Supply. A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy farms and farmers) is maintained and the numbers shown on the Register are : Milk Distributors 21 Dairies 8 15 The following licences have been issued : Dealer's Supplementary Designation Licence Licences Tuberculin Tested10 10 Pasteurised 11 10 Sterilised. 15 12 An order made under Section 23 of the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, specifying this district as one within which the use of special designations in relation to milk sold by retail is in force. During the year thirty-six samples of milk were taken for bacteriological examination; all hut one passed the Statutory tests, i.e., the Methylene Blue and Phosphatase tests in the case of pasteurised milk and Turbidity test in the case of sterilised milk. It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, to prohibit the sale of milk. Ice Cream. Ninety-seven persons are registered for the sale of ice cream in the district, including fourteen who are registered for its manufacture. All the latter use methods of heat treatment laid down in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations. In sampling, emphasis has been placed on our own manufacturers and on unwrapped ice cream brought into the district from other areas. Sixty-five samples were taken and graded as follows : Grade I 60 or 92.3% Grade II 4 or 6.2% Grade III 1 or 1.5% Grade IV 0 or 0.0% 65 100.0% Fourteen samples of water ices and ice lollies were taken, all of which were reported to be satisfactory. The Inspection of Meat and other Foods. The decontrol of meat supplies in July resulted in private slaughtering being permissible again after a lapse of fourteen years. During this time slaughterhouses in this district were used only for occasional pigs slaughtered under licence from the Ministry of Food or in cases of emergency. 16 There are now three licensed slaughterhouses in use and details of the animals slaughtered and diseases found are set out below : Cattle— excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed 78 37 78 107 1,914 Number inspected 78 37 78 107 1,914 All Diseases except Tuberculosis : Whole carcases condemned 1 1 - - 2 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 7 6 - 22 56 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis 10.2% 18.9% - 20.5% 2.9% Tuberculosis only : Whole carcases condemned 1 1 - — — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 5 6 - — 18 Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis 7.7 % 18.9% - — 0.94% The inspection of meat in slaughterhouses, which is carried out to the standards laid down in Memo. 3/Foods, resulted in the condemnation of 2,290 pounds of carcase meat and 955 pounds of offal, whilst in retail shops 1,663 pounds of raw meat and 680 pounds of tinned meat were condemned. The following foods (other than meat) were also condemned during the year : Eggs (tinned) 44 lbs. Milk and Cream (tinned) 170 lbs. Fish 33 lbs. Preserves (tinned) 27 lbs. Fish (tinned). 5 lbs. Tomato Puree, etc. (tinned) 94J cwt. Frozen foods 40 lbs. Vegetables (tinned) 283 lbs. Sandwich Spread 401 lbs. Miscellaneous tinned food 158 lbs. Fruit (tinned) . 404 lbs. Other miscellaneous food 115 lbs. Condemned foods are disposed of, whenever possible, to a manufacturer of animal feeding stuffs and fertilisers or in accordance with the Salvaged Goods (Revocation) Order, 1953. Small quantities of condemned foods are buried on the Council's refuse tip. Food Handling Byelaws Byelaws made under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, have been in force in the district since July, 1950, and have helped to bring about the considerable improvement in food hygiene standards which has taken place since that time. The 17 protection given to food to prevent contamination is greater than ever before, particularly food displayed for sale on shop counters and therefore especially liable to contamination by handling, coughing or sneezing. Clean Food Campaign. • As in previous years we have relied mainly on personal contact with food traders at their own premises to impress on them our ideas about the correct methods of preparing, handling and displaying food. The goodwill created by the Food Hygiene Guild has been of great value in this work and has resulted, with very few exceptions, in ready co-operation between the trader and the Sanitary Inspector. Regular meetings of the Food Hygiene Guild have not been necessary during the year but the distribution of badges, plaques and other display material has continued. It is expected that Food Hygiene Regulations under the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, will shortly be issued and if, as expected, a standard equal to or in advance of Guild standards is laid down, they would have a far-reaching effect on the constitution of the Guild. The existence of the Guild would however provide an invaluable method of introducing new legislation to food traders and ensuring that the requirements of the regulations will be readily met. The Council's notice boards in all parts of the district have again been used for the display of food hygiene propaganda posters of the type issued by the Central Council for Health Education and the Ministry of Health. Hawkers of Food. The registration of hawkers of certain classes of food has been compulsory in this district since 1939 and immediately after the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, came into force the Council adopted Section 11 of the Act to extend the registration of hawkers to cover all classes of foodstuffs. The vehicles and storage premises used by these traders are regularly inspected by the Sanitary Inspectors. Sampling of Food and Drugs. (a) The sampling of food and drugs for chemical analysis is carried out by the Middlesex County Council and the following information regarding samples obtained during the year has been kindly supplied by the Senior Public Control Officer: 293 samples were taken, including 177 of milk; 55 (41 of which were milk) were found to be unsatisfactory. Successful proceedings were taken in one instance, the other cases being dealt with by cautions to the traders concerned. 18 (b) Miscellaneous foods, such as shell-fish, cream cakes, watercress and meat products are regularly sampled by the Sanitary Inspectors for bacteriological examination and the results are of considerable assistance to them in their contacts with foodhandlers, illustrating, as they often do, that the greatest care is necessary in the storage and handling of this class of food. The bacteriological examination of samples of milk, ice cream, water and miscellaneous foods is carried out at the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, and I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory for their ready assistance at all times. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respective headings. Food Poisoning. Only one case of food poisoning (Salmonella typhimurium) was notified during the year and as there was a period of six days between onset and notification it was not possible to trace the source of the infection. 19 Inspection of Food Premises.

HOUSING. A survey of all the old houses in the district, i.e., those constructed before 1919, was commenced in 1953, and substantially completed during the year under review. The information disclosed by the survey showed that approximately 120 houses were incapable of being rendered fit and should be demolished or closed. Early in 1954 I reported to the Council on this matter and it was agreed that an immediate start should be made on the clearance of these dwellings and that the remainder should be dealt with within the next five years. The 1954 programme consisted of a Clearance Area comprising 15 houses, 10 Demolition Orders and 2 Closing Orders. Inspection of Houses during the year. 1.

Thirty cases of overcrowding were abated during the year and twenty new cases were discovered, making a net decrease of ten in the number of cases still to be dealt with. It is interesting to note that the average number of occupants for each house in the district is now 3.60, the same as in 1940. The maximum figure recorded was 4.02 in 1947, since when there has been a slight fall every year. 21 Improvement Grants. The publicity given by the Government to the provisions of the Housing Act 1949, dealing with the improvement or conversion of dwellings with grant assistance, together with a modification of the conditions of the original scheme resulted in enquiries being made by owners in respect of the improvement of eleven premises. Three formal applications were received and in each case a grant was made, ranging between 25% and 50% of the approved expenditure. Certificates of Disrepair. During the last few weeks of the year 21 applications for Certificates of Disrepair were received from tenants whose landlords had served on them notices of increase of rent under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. In each case the application was granted. By the end of the year no applications had been received from landlords for revocation of these certificates and no other action for their annulment had been taken. Moveable Dwellings. During the year two new unauthorised caravan sites in the Harlington area came into use. One was occupied by travelling showmen and the other by gypsies. In both cases the owner of the land had permitted the use of the land by caravans, and at the end of the year legal proceedings against him were under consideration. There has been little variation in the number of other caravans in the district and the number still stands at approximately 120, almost all on unauthorised sites. Land has been acquired for a municipal site and at the end of the year a modified scheme was in course of preparation after the proposals originally adopted had been found to be too costly. New Houses During the year 1954 the following dwellings were completed by the Council and private developers : Council.
