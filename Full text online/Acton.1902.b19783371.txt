ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER For the Year ending 31st December 1902. To the Chairman and Members of the Acton District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Annual Report—the ninth that I have presented—concerning the Vital Statistics and General Sanitary Condition of your Town. The Death Rate is the lowest on record, and is due to a great extent to the attention and care that you have devoted to matters connected with the health of the district. There is nothing so conducive to popularising a district as a low Death Rate, and I sincerely trust that the efforts you are making to render Acton a thoroughly desirable Residential Suburb will meet with the success they deserve. Our Infant Mortality is the lowest since 1891—this happy result being due to the diminished number of deaths from Epidemic Diarrhoea. I have reported fully on the outbreak of Small Pox, and the measures taken for dealing with the same. The arrangements that you have made with the Clare Hall Small Pox Hospital, South Mimms, to retain ten beds is a very wise and necessary precaution. The efforts we are now making to deal with Consumption will, I trust, help to relieve much suffering and prevent unnecessary infection. The arrangements for dealing with our Sewage by means of Bacteria are now completed, the three Septic Tanks and Filters being in full 4 working order. I shall, according to your instructions, report every Quarter as to the working of the same. For nine successive years I have drawn attention to the great need of an Isolation Hospital and Dust Destructor, and it is a great satisfaction for me to know that both will shortly be in evidence, the work having been practically started as regards the Hospital. I have reported fully on the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. This is necessary, as the Act specifies that I must do so, and forward a Copy of my Report to the Secretary of State. You will notice in my Tables dealing with the Vital Statistics, the increase in the number of inhabited houses, and the rapid development of the district. I am pleased to state there has been a very great improvement in the Scavenging of the district, especially with regard to the main streets and thoroughfares. Very few complaints now reach me with regard to the non-removal of dust-bin refuse, and on making inquiries with regard to these complaints, I invariably find that the tenants themselves are to blame. I have made a systematic crusade against the habit of sweeping the dust and refuse from houses on to the pavements and into the roadway after 8 a.m. To my mind this is a most dangerous proceeding, for this dust is full of micro-organisms often of a virulent character. The work of my department has been carried out entirely to my satisfaction during the year, and I am much indebted to Mr Kinch, Chief Sanitary Inspector, and Mr Fraser, Assistant Sanitary Inspector, for their valuable assistance. In conclusion, I beg to thank the Chairman and Members of the Council for their kind help and co-operation. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, G. A. GARRY SIMPSON. 5 SANITARY STAFF. G. A.

There were 187 deaths registered of Infants under one year of age as against 1,242 births; the proportion which the deaths under one year of age bear to 1,000 births is therefore 149.8 as against 170.1 in the preceding year. The following table compares the death rate of children under one year per 1,000 registered births, and the birth-rate for the last sixteen years:— Year. Birth Rate per 1,000. Deaths of Children under one year, per 1,000 Registered Births. 1887 28.7 147 1888 31.1 182 1889 34.1 175 1890 28.3 151 1891 30.8 146 1892 30.5 185 1893 31.9 192.5 1894 30.2 160.6 1895 31.6 168.1 1896 30.3 168.9 1897 30.7 198.3 1898 30.5 181.9 1899 31.7 187.2 1900 28.1 168.5 1901 32.0 170.1 1902 27.8 149.8 In my Annual Report for 1901 I dealt fully on the causes of our Infant Mortality, and among other suggestions I advised the establishment of a creche. The Sanitary Committee instructed me to draw up a report. This I did after making full inquiries. On writing to the Local Government Board on the subject we were informed that the Council could not support a creche out of the rates. Its establishment, therefore, would have to be entirely by voluntary contributions, and there is a golden opportunity for some philanthropic person to give it a start. In towns such as Manchester, Norwich, and Deptford, private creches are established, and pay their way. Such an institution is 12 greatly needed in Acton owing to our laundry industry and high infant mortality. If the clergy and ministers of religion would take the matter in hand, and a committee of ladies formed, subscriptions could be invited, and in this way an advance would be made. It is gratifying, however, to be able to report a low infant mortality compared with previous years, viz., 149.8, against 170.1 in 1901. This is due to the diminished number of deaths from epidemic diarrhoea. Twenty-three deaths were registered, as against 69 in 1901, and 50 in 1900. Of the 23 deaths— 18 were children under 1 year of age. 4 were children between 1 and 5. 1 adult over 65 years. WHOOPING COUGH. There were 13 deaths from Whooping Cough. The relation in which this number stands to that of previous years is shown in the table on page 10. With a view of educating the poorer classes I have drawn up the following leaflet, which was widely circulated during the Spring, when the disease is most prevalent. Instructions to the Public as regards Whooping Cough. Leaflet issued by the Acton District Council. This disease is most fatal in young children. Out of every 100 deaths from Whooping Cough, 96 occur in children below five years of age. A Child suffering frotn this Disease should be Isolated, and not brought in contact with any other children until the characteristic spasmodic cough or whoop has disappeared for at least a week. This may be six weeks or more from the commencement of the illness. The Disease is spread by the Breath and Sputa of the Patient. Whatever the child coughs up should be received on paper or rags, and immediately burned. The Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Gothic Villa, Mill Hill Grove, Acton, W. 13 PHTHISIS OR CONSUMPTION. Following the suggestion in my Report of 1901, you have instituted voluntary notification. We were one of the first urban authorities to adopt this valuable preventive measure, and our example has been rapidly followed by all surrounding districts. The notification is always verified by a bacteriological examination. Small sputum bottles have been forwarded to the practitioners in the district, so that they can have an examination made without delay in any suspicious case free of charge. If medical practitioners could be induced as a routine measure to obtain this examination in every suspicious case, much unsuspected infection would be stopped. As a means of preventing re-infection from spitting, the following card has been widely circulated and hung in Public-houses, Laundries, Workshops, and all Public Institutions. The Urban District Council of Acton. Public Health Department. SPITTING IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF THE SPREAD OF CONSUMPTION. The Public are earnestly requested in the interests of Public Health not to expectorate on the ground, but into proper receptacles. Medical Officer of Health. The following is the scheme of preventive measures :— 1. Voluntary notification. 2. Diagnosis by bacteriological examination of sputum. 3. Visit to house, distribution of leaflet, with advice as to fresh air, and danger of spitting except into proper receptacles. 4. Cleansing and disinfection— (а) After notification. (b) After change of address. (c) After death. 5. Investigation of sources of infection (Office and Workshop —Home). 6. Removal of patient if possible for sanatorium treatment. 7. Removal of food infection. 14 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR 1902. Notifiable Disease. Cases Notified in Whole District. Total Cases Notified in each Locality.

Origin and Cause of the Epidemic. The Epidemic started in London about July 1901, and made its appearance in Acton on 18th November 1901, when a case was notified from Meon Road, South Acton. The next case occurred on 1st January 1902, when I found a man suffering from malignant Small Pox lying in a shed in Gladstone Road, Acton Green. 16 The following table shows the number of cases notified each month during 1902, up to August, after which no further cases occurred:— January 4 cases.

Notification.—Immediately on receiving notice of a case, whether of a suspicious nature or not, I visited the patient without delay. If the case turned out to be one of true Variola, I at once informed the Public Vaccinator and the whole of my Staff, who stood to their posts. Isolation.—Isolation was secured in every case, except one, by the removal of the patient to the Clare Hall Hospital, South Mimms. This removal was generally managed within two hours of the case being notified, with the exception of cases discovered in the evening. The Hospital refuses to take cases after 8 p.m., and under these circumstances the patients were removed early the following morning. Disinfection.—The rooms were fumigated with Formic Aldehyde, the floors washed down with liquid disinfectant, and the walls stripped. All bedding and textile articles were disinfected by steam in our Washington Lyons disinfector. Vaccination.—Without loss of time Dr Aird Jolly, the Public Vaccinator, visited the premises and vaccinated or re-vaccinated all contacts. I am much indebted to this gentleman for his prompt and valuable assistance. Contacts.—The names and addresses of all contacts were taken, together with premises they had recently visited and where they were working. Some of them it was thought advisable to quarantine, and to pay them each week in order to secure confinement to the house. Where it was possible to re-vaccinate certain contacts and to disinfect their clothes and bodies, we allowed them to follow their usual occupations. No contact or person who was residing in a recently infected house was allowed to continue their work at a laundry until all danger from infection was over. In these cases the Council sanctioned a weekly payment. All recently infected houses were visited either by myself or the Sanitary Inspectors day by day in order to deal promptly with any fresh cases that might arise. The number of contacts averaged about six to each case notified, making a total of 180. 18 Other Precautions taken. In every case where I could trace a source of infection to another district I immediately communicated with the Medical Officer of Health of that district. In case of a contact leaving my district, and his destination being known, I at once informed the Medical Officer of Health of that district. Procrastination would be fatal in Small Pox epidemics. The Medical Officer of Health and his Staff must be always alert and on duty, for by visiting cases at once the spread of the infection by contacts is arrested. I will only quote one case out of many to verify the above remarks. One evening, at 10.30 p.m., I was informed of a case in a crowded neighbourhood. I went at once, and found a man who had been sitting by the patient for some hours in a close stuffy little room, on the point of leaving for the Common Lodging House. I got the man to consent to remain in the house until the patient had been removed and the premises and clothing, &c., thoroughly disinfected. As a consequence, no other case occurred. In the Autumn of 1901, at my suggestion, you made Chicken Pox notifiable, and this measure has on more than one occasion been of the greatest value. Every case of Chicken Pox notified during the last eighteen months has been personally visited by myself. Early in the outbreak the whole of the members of the staff were re-vaccinated, with one exception. This was one of the men employed in removing infected bedding; he refused to undergo the operation and promptly caught the disease. During the epidemic house-to-house inspection was made where circumstances seemed to point to the desirability of such a step. Lessons to be Learnt from the Epidemic. (1.) That it is possible to modify or even entirely prevent an attack of Small Pox by vaccination performed some days after infection. This is especially the case with re-vaccination, the incubation of which is often shorter than in primary vaccination. The period of incubation in Small Pox is, twelve days. Cases to illustrate the above remarks.—One man had been ill for eight days when I saw him, and had not sought medical advice. He was well advanced in the vesicular stage. There were fifteen inmates 19 in the house. Re-vaccination was at once performed on thirteen and primary vaccination on two of the inmates. Seven of these inmates developed the disease from ten to twelve days after the first case was removed, but they had it so mildly that it was only necessary to detain them in Hospital for a week or two. (2.) That it is possible to have Small Pox so modified that it is not recognised by the individual, his symptoms being so mild that he goes about his daily avocation as usual. Case to illustrate:—It came to my knowledge that a young woman at Southall developed Small Pox just twelve days after receiving a visit from an Acton man. I at once went and looked up this individual, and ascertained that he had had an attack of lumbago and one or two spots on his forehead. One was so typical that I had no hesitation in my own mind that he had had the disease and given it to the young woman at Southall. I therefore had the man, his clothing and house at once disinfected. Two days later a woman residing in the same house as the man developed typical Small Pox and was removed to the Hospital, thus confirming my diagnosis. These ambulatory cases are the most dangerous that the Medical Officer has to deal with. This man we know gave the disease to two persons, but how many others he infected I cannot say. (a.) That malignant or hemorrhagic Small Pox is invariably fatal. Two patients developed this terrible form—a man who died on the second day after removal, and a woman who had a few days previously been confined, on the third day. Neither had been re-vaccinated since infancy. Unvaccinated infants also invariably die, and suffer from the confluent form. This was the case of an infant three months old in Bedford Park. (4.) That a considerable amount of re-vaccination must have exercised some influence in checking the spread of infection, but it is evident that a very large proportion of the working classes failed to avail themselves of this protection. (5.) That if we are to enjoy the immunity from Small Pox that falls to the lot of Germany, re-vaccination must be made compulsory about puberty. As the responsible officer for the measures that have to be taken in dealing with a Small Pox epidemic it is essential that the Medical 20 Officer of Health should have an efficient staff. I cannot speak too highly of the way in which I was seconded by Messrs Kinch and Fraser, the Sanitary Inspectors, and also by Mr King, who disinfected the premises. They all cheerfully fell in with the work without a moment's delay on any day of the week, or at any time day or night. It was remarkable how much of the work in connection with the outbreak fell to our lot after ordinary office hours, and especially upon Sundays. Much of our success in dealing with the epidemic was also due to my brother practitioners, for they one and all informed me at once of any suspicious case, and kindly asked me to see the patient with them. In conclusion, I take this opportunity of gratefully acknowledging the good counsel and support which I received from the members of the Sanitary Committee and the Council. Mr Morris, Chairman of the Council, Mr Hunt, then Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, and our present Chairman of the Committee, Mr Monson, gave up much of their valuable time in assisting to tide us over a very anxious period. SCARLET FEVER. One hundred and nine cases were notified during the year. The following table shows the ages of those affected Age. No. of Cases. Age. No. of Cases. Under 1 year 1 12 years 3 1 „ 3 13 „ 3 2 ,, 6 14 „ 3 3 „ 10 15 „ 1 4 „ 10 16 „ 4 5 „ 8 18 „ 1 6 „ 8 19 „ 2 7 „ 13 20 „ 3 8 ,, 9 21 to 25 years 6 9 ,, 2 26 to 30 „ 5 10 „ 3 31 to 40 „ 3 11 ,, 2 Total 109 So far as these cases go they show that there is little liability to the illness under one year of age; that up to four years the liability increases, then gradually diminishing as years go on. The above figures also show that no age up to middle life is entirely exempt. 21 It was ascertained that the following schools had been attended by children previous to their developing Scarlet Fever :— School. No. of Cases. All Saints, South Acton 4 Osborne Road, South Acton 5 Priory School, Acton Lane 11 Beaumont Park, Acton Green 13 East Acton 5 Churchfield Hall 6 St Mary's, Oldham Terrace 7 Willesden Junction 3 Haberdashers' 1 Private and other Schools 20 DIPHTHERIA. Thirty-three cases were notified. As I have repeatedly pointed out, it is impossible to say whether a suspicious case is true Diphtheria without a bacteriological examination, and medical practitioners err on the right side in notifying the same. I trust that when the new municipal buildings are erected, provision will be made for a small laboratory where such examinations can be conducted. In the meantime I beg to ask the Council to make arrangements with the Clinical Research Association to conduct these necessary examinations for us. This course is followed by several other sanitary authorities, and the cost is very small. We have a striking example of the progress preventive medicine is making in the treatment of this disease. In Diphtheria Antitoxin we have a sure remedy if the treatment is applied before the poison has had time to do its work. The following figures of the Metropolitan Asylums Board are particularly instructive, showing the results of the antitoxic treatment of Diphtheria at the Brook Hospital, Shooters Hill, 1901:— Treated on Cases. Mortality per cent. First day of Disease 38 0.0 Second „ 170 4.1 Third ,, 192 11.9 Fourth „ 137 12.4 Fifth day and after 186 16.6 22 The importance of injecting the serum early is proved to the hilt in the above figures, and as no harm can accrue to the patients if ordinary antiseptic precautions are taken, a dose of the Antitoxin should be given at once in every suspicious case. I keep a supply of fresh serum from the Jenner Institute, and medical practitioners can have it by applying at my private residence any time of the day or night. The Prophylactic Use of Diphtheria Antitoxin is especially indicated where a case or cases of Diphtheria occur among susceptible individuals who are more or less closely associated, as, for example, in families, schools, and institutions. Under such conditions, as soon as the primary case is recognised, all those who in any way may have come in contact with it, or better still, all the susceptible individuals in the institution, should without delay be injected with a dose of Diphtheria Antitoxin. Many records have now been published as to the efficacy of prophylactic injections as a preventive. The Health Department of Burton-upon-Trent have issued a circular to the medical men of the district, emphasising the value of Antitoxin as a preventive. In the combined rural districts of Chelmsford, and Maldon there were 24 families in which cases of Diphtheria antitoxon occurred. The remaining unaffected members of these families comprised 144 individuals, and to 136 of these prophylactic injections of Diphtheria were given, and among this number only a single doubtful case of Diphtheria occurred. Of the eight uninjected individuals, three subsequently developed Diphtheria. In a Convalescent Home containing 38 children, three consecutive cases of Diphtheria occurred. The remaining 35 children were each injected with Diphtheria Antitoxin (334 units each), and no further case developed. With regard to the amount of Diphtheria Antitoxin required for prophylactic purposes, probably, as a minimum, 300 units should be given to children, and 500 units to adults. Although the immunity induced by the injection is rapidly acquired, probably within a few hours it slowly passes off, and cannot be regarded as lasting for more than three weeks. 23 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. As required by Section 132 of the above Act, I beg to report on the administration of the same in this District during the year. There are 267 Workshops on the Register, but this I am of opinion is not all, as we are constantly finding out premises which come under the Act, the occupier having failed to report him or herself. When classified, there are 182 Laundries, 24 Retail Bakehouses, and 61 other Workshops. These include tenement and domestic Workshops but not Domestic Factories or Workplaces. Personally I have made 64 inspections, and the Sanitary Inspectors 239. It will be noticed that the Laundry industry comprises the chief business of the Workshops. As to the sanitation of these premises, which embraces cleanliness, air space, ventilation, and drainage, I must say it is very good on the whole, very few Notices having to be served, and only one prosecution (in which we were successful) has been necessary. This was under Section 8, as to the wet state of the floor, and means of draining the same. Of the 24 Retail Bakehouses on the Register, 11 are underground. It has not been necessary to serve Notices on the occupiers as to sanitary defects, and the premises have been regularly whitewashed twice yearly as prescribed by the Act, and visited 89 times by the Sanitary Inspectors. The following are the provisions of Section 101 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, which relates to Bakehouses:— "1. An Underground Bakehouse shall not be used as a Bakehouse unless it is so used at the passing of this Act. "2. Subject to the foregoing provision, after the first day of January 1904, an Underground Bakehouse shall not be used unless certified by the District Council to be suitable for that purpose. "3. For the purpose of this section an Underground Bakehouse shall mean a Bakehouse, any baking room of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the adjoining street or the ground adjoining or nearest to the room. The expression ' baking room ' means any room used for baking or for any process incidental thereto. "4. An Underground Bakehouse shall not be certified as suitable unless the District Council is satisfied that it is suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects. "6. If any place is used in contravention to this section, it shall be deemed to be a Workshop not kept in conformity with this Act." 24 During November and December of last year I visited all the Underground Bakehouses in company with the Sanitary Inspector, and on the 9th December I laid before the Sanitary Committee a full Report thereon, with the following model recommendations for making them absolutely sanitary :— Capacity.—The bakehouse must have a capacity of not less than 1,000 cubic feet. Floor Space.—The floor space must not be less than 125 square feet. Height.—The bakehouse should be in every part thereof 8 feet high, measured from the floor to the ceiling. Ceilings. —All ceilings, beams, and joists to be thoroughly scraped and cleansed, and to be match-boarded with tongued and grooved match-boarding, or lathed and rendered in Portland cement or similar damp-proof and impervious material, worked to an even and polished surface and limewashed. Walls.—All walls to be damp-proof, and to be maintained in such condition. All projections and irregularities in existing walls to be removed, and all hollows and crevices to be filled up with suitable material. The joints of all walls (except external walls) to be raked out, and the walls hacked over and rendered with Portland cement and sand, mixed in the proportions of one part Portland cement to three parts of clean, sharp sand, and such rendering to be left¾ inch thick at all points and finished to a smooth and polished surface. Note.—White glazed bricks, tiles, or opalite are preferred. Floors.—The whole of the existing floors to be taken up and re-formed and re-laid, where necessary, 6 inches thick over the entire surface with Portland cement concrete, mixed in proportions one part Portland cement to five parts of broken stone or bricks and one part clean sharp sand. The surface to be finished with a ½-inch layer of Portland cement and granite chippings to pass a ¼-inch mesh, mixed in equal proportions, or of good flags 3 inches thick with cement joints. The floor should be laid to proper falls, and be drained by means of a suitable channel to a gully, over which, if practicable, a draw-off tap should be fixed, the gully being properly dished and placed outside the bakehouse. Yards.—Any yard or passage-way adjoining the entrance of the bakehouse to be paved with cement or other hard, durable, and impervious material at least 3 inches thick, and formed to fall towards a properly trapped drain inlet outside. Lighting.—All areas provided for the purpose of admitting light to be, if necessary, lined with white glazed tiles, bricks, or opalite, with splayed bottom for the purpose of cleansing, and fitted with pavement lights over the lighting area. To provide and fix hopper lights of an approved pattern above the pavement lights in the lighting area, and to make all the requisite alterations to the ceiling to permit of the proper working of the hopper lights. Permission to construct hopper lights in the street or passage must be obtained from the Council. All artificial lights are to be arranged in such a manner as will assist the ventilation of the bakehouse, as well as to enable any products of combustion to be drawn away. Ventilation.—Fresh air is to be provided by means of three air inlets on the "Tobin" tube system, each of a sectional area as will be sufficient, and which size will be decided on the cubic contents of the bakehouse, the number of hands 25 employed, and the velocity of the passage of the air. The intakes for the same are to be fixed not less than 6 feet above the level of the adjoining street or yard in a position free from dust or dirt, and to be protected by grids of a clear ventilating area equal to that of the respective inlet tubes. The inlet tubes to discharge at a height of 5 feet 6 inches above the level of the bakehouse floor. Any existing air bricks and openings in walls are to be built up. The foul air is to be drawn away by means of two extract ventilators at ceiling level, each of a total internal sectional area as is necessary, and calculated on the same basis as the inlets, and fitted with bell-mouth inlets 18 inches in diameter. The extract tubes to be carried over the oven and connected to an outside upright shaft of sufficient sectional area, terminating at a reasonable height above the intake inlets and fitted with a wire guard. All tubes are to be carried in direct lines and with few bends as possible. No right-angled or acute bends will be allowed. No perforated zinc is to be used, but fine gauged wire netting of not less than ½inch square mesh is to be fitted over the bell-mouth outlets and the air inlets. Flour Storage, &c. — Provision is to be made for the proper storage of flour, potatoes, salt, and all other constituents or ingredients used in the bakehouse elsewhere than in the underground bakehouse itself. Such store places must be as strictly and properly kept as a bakehouse. Fittings.—All dough troughs, tables, and bins are to be provided with strong swivel castors or wheels, and arranged so as to be easily moved and allow for proper cleansing and inspection. Woodwork usually painted to have three coats of good oil paint, including the primary coat. Shelves, &c.—The joints of shelving or other woodwork joints at walls and other places to be filled in with suitable material, and left smooth, flush, and even. Staircase. —No outside staircase shall terminate within the bakehouse. I should like to advise the Council not to grant any certificates and thus close them all, but I feel that such a step would practically ruin several hard-working and deserving persons who have invested their little all in their business. You have appointed a small Sub-Committee for the purpose of inspecting these premises, but it must be borne in mind that once these premises are passed they can be used for all time as Bakehouses, and that now is the golden opportunity for the Council to have them made healthy for the workers, and constructed so that the conditions under which bread, &c., is prepared are clean and wholesome. The chief difficulties arise in providing suitable ventilation, lighting, and the prevention of dampness and dust. There is no need for me to again discuss the ill effects of dust and the dust question generally, as I have repeatedly brought this important question before you, and I have seen from the Report of the Delegates who visited the Sanitary Congress at Manchester that you are fully alive to its injurious effects. 26 The Public Health Act Amendment Act, 1890, has been adopted for some time by the Council. Under Section 22, which relates to W.C. accommodation in Factories and Workshops, eight closets for persons of either sex have been provided, and no prosecutions have been necessary to enforce the provisions of this section. As to the means of escape in case of Fire from premises coming under this Act I am not called upon to report. With reference to Sections 107 to 115, which deal with Homework, I beg to report that the total number of lists received during the year were 32, representing 30 employers, 2 contractors, and 87 out-workers. Under the Act, employers or contractors giving out Home-Work are required to send a list of all persons employed by them to do such Home-Work to the District Council twice a year, viz., on or before the 1st of February and on or before the 1st of August. No such lists were received up to February—the 32 being received between then and 1st August. I do not think these would have come in then had it not been for the Council's action in inserting the requirements of this section for two weeks in May in the local newspapers. The sending in of these lists only refers to persons giving out work connected with the following trades, viz.— The making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing, repairing of wearing apparel, and any work incidental thereto. The making, ornamenting, mending, and finishing of lace curtains and nets. Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work. The making of electro-plate. The making of files. Fur pulling. Thirty-two is a very small number of lists for a District like Acton, and I should recommend the Council to take proceedings against persons whom we find are contravening this section, not for the sake of recovering the penalty, but because I know of no other effective way of making the requirements of the section known. These lists are of great assistance, and are always referred to upon the receipt of a notification of Infectious Disease. They also enable us to inspect 27 the out-workers' home and to see that the premises are wholesome and fit for the purpose used. I am pleased to say no Prohibition Order as to infected houses has been necessary. Forty-six notices have been received from H.M. Inspectors of Factories, dealing principally with defective closets, insufficient closet accommodation for persons of either sex, defective wash-house floors, dirty walls, and inefficient ventilation to work rooms. Immediately on receipt of these notices the Sanitary Inspectors visit the premises to which they relate, and make a thorough inspection of the drains and sanitary appliances. Notices are served on the Owner or Occupier to abate the nuisance complained of, and when this has been done the Factory Inspector is at once informed, as required by Section 5. Under this section also one month is allowed to abate the nuisance, and if the Council do not take action to enforce abatement, the Home Office may take proceedings, and any expense incurred in so doing shall be charged to the Council. Twelve notices were sent to H.M. Factory Inspector re workshops not having the prescribed Abstract affixed, under Section 133. Each year there is an improvement in the condition of the Laundries, but I hope for still further improvement. Much good work is being done under this new Act. SICK-NURSING. The nurses in connection with our Cottage Hospital have had under treatment 305 patients, and paid 7,753 visits, an average of 25 to each patient. Excellent work is done by these ladies, whose skill and sympathy is greatly appreciated. Nurse Dawkins has paid 1,078 visits, and nursed patients when necessary. She has also given out 606 bottles of disinfectant and accompanied eight patients to Hospital. She has also distributed various leaflets. MORTUARY. During the year 36 bodies were received into the Mortuary, viz., 21 Males and 15 Females. Post-Mortems were made in 30 cases. 28 Annual Report of tbe Sanitary Inspector for the Dear 1902. To Dr G. A. Garry Simpson, Medical Officer of Health. Sir,—I herewith present my Annual Statement, showing the particulars of the action taken in the suppression of Nuisances, &c., and various improvements effected by this Department during the year 1902. It will be seen from the tables which I have compiled that a great deal of sanitary work has been done through the medium of this Department, although the Small Pox outbreak during the year interrupted our work to no small degree, as my own time and that of my Assistant was for many days taken up with removing Cases to Hospital and following up contacts, &c. I am pleased to state that now we have a separate office, the work is done in a more systematic manner than was possible when we were hampered through lack of office accommodation. The provision of a Typewriter at the beginning of the year has proved invaluable, for we are now able to write our letters, notices, reports, &c., in far less time than was possible before, thus saving much valuable time. The new Factory and Workshop Act which came into force on 1st January has added considerably to the work of your Inspectors. Mr Fraser, my Assistant, has now been with me eighteen months, and I can only speak in the highest terms of his abilities, and the manner in which he has discharged his duties. I only hope that I shall be able to retain his services for some years. I am, Dear Sir, obediently yours, Maurice W. Kinch. Public Health Department, Gothic Villa, Mill Hill Grove. 29 Number of Inspections, &c. 1,754 Premises inspected. 3,091 Re-inspections to premises where Nuisances were in course of abatement. 2,809 Nuisances were reported. 2,628 „ „ abated. 1,108 Letters written. 1,206 „ received. 64 Notices received from H.M. Factory Inspector. 10 Library Books removed from Infected Houses and destroyed. 15 Van Dwellings inspected. 335 Visits paid to Infected Houses. 40 Infectious Patients removed to Hospitals. 356 Rooms fumigated. 18 tons 12 cwt. Bedding disinfected. 25 Closets disinfected after Enteric Fever Cases. The following Tabulated List gives particulars of the sanitary improvements effected during the year :— House drains taken up and reconstructed 48 ,, repaired 15 „ unstopped and cleansed 102 „ provided with intercepting traps 95 „ manholes provided to 109 „ ventilated 106 „ manholes to, cleansed 12 „ „ repaired 14 „ fresh-air inlets repaired 12 Water-closets repaired 36 „ new pans provided to 94 ,, unstopped and cleansed 38 „ pan closets and containers replaced by efficient pans 19 „ provided with flushing cisterns 40 „ flushing cisterns repaired 103 „ flush, disconnected from drinking water cistern 11 „ additional or separate, provided in Factories and Workshops 8 Soil-pipes repaired 9 „ ventilated 18 „ increased ventilation provided 37 ,, Norman Shaw system abolished - 2 30 Ventilating shafts repaired 27 „ provided 6 Waste-pipes, sink waste-pipes disconnected from drain 39 „ bath and lavatory waste-pipes 5 „ bath and lavatory waste-pipes disconnected from soil-pipes - 4 „ repaired 33 „ trapped with lead traps 5 Rainwater-pipes disconnected from drain 220 „ repaired 41 „ provided 10 Eaves guttering provided 27 „ repaired 35 Gully traps replaced with stoneware gullies 184 „ unstopped 25 „ provided 48 „ cement work around, repaired 20 Yards, paving repaired 116 „ paved and drained 58 „ cleansed 10 Dust-bins provided 215 Cisterns repaired and covered 24 „ cleansed 15 Houses cleansed and whitewashed 180 „ plastering of walls and ceilings repaired 52 Workshops cleansed and limewashed 26 Roofs of houses repaired 42 Floors of houses repaired or relaid 73 „ workshops repaired or relaid 24 „ stables repaired or relaid 9 Dampness of house walls remedied 6 Accumulations of refuse removed 17 „ manure removed 25 ,, water in cellars removed 5 Manure receptacles provided 21 Animals, fowls, &c., nuisances from, abated 31 Overcrowding, number of cases abated 9 Smoke nuisances, number of cases dealt with 7 Privies abolished and earth-closets provided 3 Water supply provided to houses 4 Miscellaneous nuisances abated 42 Notices.—776 Preliminary Notices and 153 Statutory Notices have been served for the abatement of Nuisances, and the necessary 31 works asked for were carried out in nearly all cases. Police Court Proceedings were taken in two instances where owners had failed to comply with Notices served. One case was withdrawn on payment of costs, the work having been done, and in the other an Order was made by the Magistrate for the work to be done in fourteen days. I beg to call your attention to the very few Police Court Proceedings and the number of Statutory Notices compared with the Preliminary ones, which shows that Statutory Notices are not asked for, unless owners absolutely refuse to comply with what I consider is a reasonable request and necessary in the interests of Public Health. Drainage Examinations.—The smoke test has been applied to Drains 153 times, and in addition 19 Drains were opened up for examination after formal written complaints had been made, and authority given for that purpose. The volatile or chemical test has also been applied to Drains in numerous instances. Inspection of Meat and other Foods- -The various Butchers' Shops, Greengrocers' Shops, and other places where food is sold were frequently inspected during the year, and on one occasion in July I found unwholesome meat exposed for sale at three Butchers' Shops. I reported the facts to the Council, and they decided to take Proceedings against the Offenders, with the result that in each case they were fined 10s. and costs. They all pleaded that the hot weather was the cause of the meat turning bad, and had they not impressed the Magistrate with this fact, I am confident that much heavier fines would have been imposed. On the 24th April I visited a Butcher's Shop in Acton Lane, and found the whole carcase of a cow which I considered unfit for human food, and no doubt you will remember that you came and looked at this carcase yourself, and agreed that the same was unfit. It was removed from the premises and condemned by a Justice and destroyed. During the year the following were seized and taken before a Justice:— 1 box Skate. 1 box Plaice. 1 carcase of Beef. Quantity of pieces of Meat. 1 box Dabs. 32 Food and Drugs Acts.—Samples under these Acts are taken by Mr W. Tyler, the County Council Inspector. No returns are supplied to our Council as to the number of samples taken in the District and the result of the analysis. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops.—There are at present 79 Dairies and Milkshops, and 7 Cowkeepers on the Register. Every quarter I forward to the occupier of every Dairy and Cowshed a Notice reminding him of his duty to have the premises limewashed, as required by the Regulations. 140 visits were paid to the Dairies and Milkshops and 21 visits to the Cowsheds, and they were found to be in good order. In one case a Cowshed was found to be inefficiently ventilated, but this was rectified on a representation being made to the occupier. Bakehouses.—The number of Bakehouses on the Register is 24, of which 11 are underground. A circular letter is sent to the occupiers every six months reminding them of the time to limewash and cleanse, as prescribed by the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. All these premises have been visited, 51 inspections having been made. Slaughterhouses. -There are 4 Slaughterhouses in the District, 2 Licensed and 2 Registered. 48 visits were paid to these premises, and upon each occasion the Bye-Laws were found to be complied with. Piggeries. -The 13 Piggeries have been inspected from time to time. Several complaints have been received with regard to the smell from the Piggeries in Old Oak Lane from persons frequenting this road, and it will be a good thing when this part of the Parish is developed for building purposes, so that we can deal with them under our Bye-Laws as we successfully did with the South Acton Piggeries. Common Lodging Houses.—Only one Common Lodging House exists in the District. This has been regularly inspected, and on all occasions was found to be in a satisfactory condition. Smoke Abatement. -All Factory and Works chimneys have been observed at frequent intervals, and in two cases Proceedings were taken against the owners for emitting dense black smoke so as to be a nuisance. In one case a conviction was obtained, and in the other an order was made to abate the nuisance, the owner having decided to erect an additional shaft and provide mechanical stokers to each of the furnaces. This work is now nearing completion.
