Sou 31 Borough of Southuuapk. ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of health, for the Year 1906. G. Millson, Medical Officer of Health. BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Public Health Office, Town Hall, Walworth Road. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my Twentieth Antiual Report on the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1906. Infectious disease, especially that of Scarlet Fever, was more than usually prevalent, but fortunately upon the whole of a mild type. Various matters such as the feeding and care of infants, the examination of unsound food, and the places where food is sold have received much attention during the year. The Southwark Health Society for voluntary workers under the direction of Misa Townsend was started and promises to do very useful work in relation with infantile mortality. It will be seen on reference to the report that excellent work has been done by all the members of the staff which I am glad to acknowledge. I have also to thank the Council and the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. TABLE OF CONTENTS. page.

The deaths of Infants under one year of age to 1,000 births were 144 during the year 1906. 6 The deaths under one year of age to 1,000 births for the last 14 years were as follows: 1893 178 1900 192 1894 163 1901 168 1895 201 1902 166 1896 192 1903 148 1897 187 1904 174 1898 190 1905 148 1899 199 1906 144 POPULATION. The tendency of many of our old inhabitants to migrate to the suburbs and to seek less crowded districts to dwell in which has been so evident during the last few years, was much more pronounced in 1906, the year under consideration. This leaving of such vast numbers has given a ragged appearance to the streets of the Borough by the large number of houses and especially shops to let, in the main streets. The glory of the ancient portion of the Borough as a residential neighbourhood has since the advent of the electrically driven tramcar seriously declined. Except to those whose families have been intimately associated with the history of Southwark, this exodus must be considered a necessity in the face of the overcrowded state of the inhabitants which was present a few years ago. The effect has been to very materially reduce house rents and to promote the reconstruction of debased property, together with the better maintenance of houses generally. The competition in the letting of houses is very keen at the present time, and unless the accommodation is sufficient and the property kept in a clean and structurally good condition there is but a very poor chance of houses letting well. The extension of the City in the form of warehouses into our Borough continues to increase year by year. The rebuilding of the Clandon Estate is progressing satisfactorily, although it will be some time before all the houses are let and the neighbourhood has permanently settled down. Southwark still remains the chief home of the "undesirable" class, who from an indisposition or an inability to work cause so much 7 anxiety in regard to infant mortality and degeneracy. The wellconducted and properly equipped workman with a trade was never more sought after than at the present time, whilst the opposite is the case with regard to the miserable unskilled-men, who married at twenty, and have remained in a poverty stricken state since that age. The population of the several 'divisions of the Borough at each Census since 1841, and also the estimated population for 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905 and 1906— Newington St.george's st.saviour's and christchurch. 1841 54,693 - - 1851 64,816 51,824 35,731 1861 82,157 55,510 36,169 1871 88,691 56,083 31,294 1881 107,831 58,652 31,628 1891 115,663 59,740 27,161 1901 121,863 60,998 23,319 1902 122,246 61,187 23,392 1903 122,572 61,343 23,454 1904 122,902 61,518 23,517 1905 123,247 61,699 23,582 1906 123,604 61,888 23,651 The Registrar General's estimate of the population of the Borough at the middle of 1906 was 209,143. 8 The Ward Distribution was as follows :— TABLE 1.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1906 was 6,079, of which 3,131 were males, and 2,948 females. This represents a birth-rate of 29'1 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births in the individual parishes was 3,591 in Newington, 1,891 in St. George the Martyr, 253 in Christchurch and 344 in St. Saviour's. In addition to the 6,079 births registered in the Borough I learn from the Registrar General that there were 146 births during the year in various lying-in institutions outside the Borough belonging to persons resident in Southwark, and this number (146) must be added to the total as above, making the actual number of births for the year 6,225, which 9 increases the birth.rate to 29.8 per 1,000. As the addresses in relation to these 146 births have not been communicated to me I am unable to allot them to their respective wards.

Of the 3,244 deaths registered in the sub-districts of the Borough, 1 ,026 occurred in the Poor-Law institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 352 belonging to Southwark, and 674 to other boroughs of the metropolis. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home-—that is, outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,197. Of this very large number as many as 687 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died at the large public hospitals. The percentage of persons dying away from home in relation to the total number of deaths occurring in the Borough was 31'7. TABLE 3. Outlying Deaths, with Localities. Males. Females. Total.

The table of Infantile Mortality shows that 25.5 per cent. of the deaths occurred during the first month, and that 59.4 of these were during the first week after birth. The large number of deaths under the heads of premature birth, atrophy and debility, congenital defects and convulsions, point to the physically poor and feeble condition of the mothers. The usual practice in Southwark is for mothers to breast feed their children, chiefly because it is more economical, and as very few of the mothers work away from home, there is very little difficulty when they are strong in getting this done. There is, however, a class of ill-developed, half-starved mothers, who whatever their wish may be, are unable from sheer poverty to produce milk fit for the baby. It is in this class that the infantile mortality assumes such huge proportions. They are obliged from insufficiency of milk to give up the idea of breast feeding and to resort to the bottle for the infant, with all its horrors and disastrous effects. It is a difficult matter to decide as to how far the public authority should take in hand the feeding of these infants who if left alone must certainly die. It seems to be rather irrational that the badly equipped in the way of getting a living, should be allowed to go on living and having children without some attempt being made either to improve their citizen qualities, or to restrict in some way their privileges. In our Borough the manufacture of this bad and undesirable class appears to me to be increasing year by year, and now stands as a serious menace to the health and prosperity of the district. Much attention has been given during the year by the lady inspectors to the condition of the poorer class of houses and to the care and proper bringing up of infants. The present fashion of parents relieving themselves of all responsibility for the proper equipment of their children after school age for becoming good citizens, is largely responsible for the crime and distress we see around us. If it is necessary and wise to give a child an acquaintance with the rudiments of a general education, how much more useful must it be to him to be taught a handicraft to enable him if well conducted, to earn a wage sufficient to allow him to live in a decent manner. Until this is done little blame can attach to those who, from hardly any fault of their own, are marching on to swell the large army of "undesirables." 27 TABLE 10.

No case of this disease was notified during the year 1906. Deaths from Small-pox during the last ten years:— 1897 1 1902 78 1898 — 1903 — 1899 — 1904 1 1900 — 1905 — 1901 14 1906 — SCARLET FEVER. The deaths from Scarlet Fever in the Borough were 45 during 1906, as against 28 for the year 1905, and 12 for 1904. It will be seen on reference to table 28 that the disease has not increased in virulence, as the percentage of deaths to the number of cases notified is less than that of the previous year. The large increase in the prevalence of the complaint has been brought about by the small number notified in each of the three previous years, and in consequence the presence in the Borough of more than the usual number of susceptible children. This is seen to be the case by the ages of those attacked being above the usual average. The removal of so large a number to hospital has been of immense benefit to our inhabitants, not only in the removal of the sick from the healthy, but in the better treatment of the patients, who cannot, owing to the very limited house room at the disposal of the family, be sufficiently cared for at home. I have no doubt that the complaint is largely spread by the mild cases which remain often undiscovered until the peeling stage attracts attention. This certainly has been so with many batches of cases which have arisen in the year under consideration. The total number of cases notified was 1,470 this year, as against 776 for 1905. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 3.0. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.21. The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The deaths in the 1,440 cases sent to hospital were 45, a mortality of 3.2 per cent. In the 42 cases treated at home there was no death. It is our practice in all cases to strip the paper off the walls in the process of disinfection of rooms after Scarlet Fever. The Wards most affected were St. John's, St. George's, All Saints' and St. Michael's in the order named. DIPHTHERIA. The disease which reached its lowest point in 1904 has since then steadily increased. The periodic flooding of the basements with sewage in the low lying parts of the Borough on the occurrence of every heavy rain must act very prejudicially on the health of children exposed to such conditions. The contamination with sewage of so much of our subsoil from the cause referred to, must prepare the children for infection from diphtheria. Southwark with its splendid sandy subsoil if it were not for this flooding, would, in my opinion, have little of this complaint to record. Although the number of cases has increased this year, the mortality rate has diminished by one half. The deaths numbered 31 as against 44 for the year 1905. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 401, and 304 for the preceding year. The percentage of deaths to the total number of cases notified was 7.0. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.15. 53 The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was :— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The Wards most affected were St. Mary's, All Saints', St. Michael's and St. George's, in the order named. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever during the year, numbered 12, as against 11 and 18 for the years 1905 and 1904. The total number of cases notified was 111 for the present year, and 74 and 92 for 1905-4. The percentage of deaths to the total number notified was 10 9. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.06. Deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years : 1897 21 1902 23 1898 20 1903 23 1899 32 1904 18 1900 39 1905 11 1901 18 1906 12 54 The number of cases notified during the last ten years :— 1897 135 1902 193 1898 144 1903 122 1899 178 1904 92 1900 307 1905 74 1901 135 1906 111 Of the 111 cases notified as many as 105 were removed to hospital, of which 8 died, a mortality of 6.7 per cent. In the 6 cases treated at home 4 died, a mortality of 66.6 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 94 6. A careful inquiry was made in every case. Oysters were thought to be the cause in 4 cases, Mussels in 3, Cockles in 5, Periwinkles in 1, Fried Fish in 10, Water Cress in 4, Meat Pie in 1, and Ice Cream in 6. The evidence seemed to be conclusive in regard to the shell-fish, and very strong in attributing many of the cases to fried fish. Twenty-five of the total cases were infected by contact with those infected. In one group of cases the father of a family had recently come from India. On his arrival he sickened with Enteric. Before he was notified as suffering he had infected four other members of the family. Twenty cases in all could be traced to this father from India. On examination of the drains of the houses in Trafalgar Street, where some of these cases occurred, grave defects were found which, in my opinion, must have assisted very materially in lowering the health of the inhabitants of those houses, and so preparing them for the disease. The first few cases occurred in houses where the drains were in combination. DIARRHAEA. The deaths during the year from this disease numbered 225, as against 183 and 282 for the preceding two years. This number of deaths may not be considered to be excessive for Southwark in a hot year, during the months of July, August and September, yet there is the fact that at this period of the year the milk that is usually given to artificially fed infants is simply poisonous. It is not impossible to provide suitable milk during summer weather for infants, and the Council would be doing much good in the direction of lessening the high infant mortality, if this matter were 55 seriously considered. The solution of the problem does not rest alone with the sterilisation of ordinary milk and the setting up of an expensive plant. I believe the most suitable milk might be distributed by the Council at a very modest annual expense. The annual death-rate for Diarrhaea per 1,000 living was 1-08. Deaths from diarrhasa during the last ten years: 1897 300 1902 169 1898 306 1903 197 1899 260 1904 282 1900 233 1905 183 1901 222 1906 225 In every case of death from diarrhasa the house was examined, and the history of the case in regard to the feeding of the infant (when such deaths occurred in infants) was reported upon, together with the cleanliness of the home and the habits of the parents. The handbill on " how to prevent infant diarrhrea" was distributed as usual throughout the Borough. TYPHUS FEVER. No death has occurred from this disease during the year, and no case was notified. MEASLES. The deaths from Measles during the year numbered 95, as against 154 and 191 for the previous two years. The Wards mostly affected were those of St. George, Trinity and St. Michael. The death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.46. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years :— 1897 184 1902 164 1898 145 1903 83 1899 171 1904 191 1900 116 1905 154 1901 161 1906 95 56 WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease were 54, as against 80 and 118 in the in the preceding two years. The Wards of St. Peter Trinity and St. Michael, in the order named, were those most affected. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.26. Deaths from Whooping Cough during the last ten years 1897 126 1902 114 1898 93 1903 68 1899 146 1904 118 1900 120 1905 80 1901 98 1906 54 Notification of Phthisis. Under the voluntary system of notification of phthisis 399 certificates were received in the year under consideration, as against 323 for 1905, and 207 for 1904. Although the numbers are increasing year by year, I see no prospect of the disease on account of this notification materially decreasing, or being under better control, as the cases referred to us are not of the kind to be much benefited by what we can do for them. They are chiefly poor law cases, or those in a moribund condition. The greater part of the medical practitioners of the Borough do not notify cases of Phthisis. Unless this voluntary system is to lead ultimately to compulsory notification, I fail to see much good in it. In the few cases treated at home, our practice is to have the room occupied by the patient sprayed with formalin once a week, and to have the bedding disinfected by steam once in three months. When death takes place, or on a change of residence, the room and contents are thoroughly disinfected. This matter of the notification of Phthisis was before the Council in the middle of the year, when it was decided (a) "That this Council is not in favour of compulsory notification of Phthisis;" (b) "That in the opinion of the Council the system of voluntary notification of Phthisis should be adopted throughout London, and that particulars as to out-patients attending hospitals and dispensaries should be obtained by the London County Council and forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health of each Metropolitan Borough.'' 57 TABLE 31.

About the middle of the year. at the request of Dr. Buchanan of the Local Government Board, I examined 51 samples of Canned Food purchased from shops in the Borough. The object of the examination was to ascertain the "condition" of the food when opened. It will be seen by the table that the satisfactory appearance of the can before it is opened is not always a sure guide as to the condition of the food when the can is opened. Some of the samples which looked sound outside were found, when opened, unsound and unfit for food. Much of the food recognised as sound, was dry and tasteless. The "paste" foods appeared to have a common base of chopped meat and lard, flavoured and seasoned according to the label, whether "Chicken and Ham," "Turkey," "Veal and Ham," &c. Much of the outside of the food was discoloured by the tin. A large portion of the samples recognised as sound, looked anything but appetising. TABLE 45.

From time to time during the year I have reported on my personal inspection of places in the Borough where food is prepared for sale or where it is exposed for sale. In many instances I was accompanied by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee. Our practice of having a three-monthly report from the Ward Sanitary Inspectors on the cleanly state of places where food is prepared has much improved the eating houses and the potted meat and sausage factories of the Borough. In regard to retail shops the tinned food examined there has shown that constant supervision is necessary on the part of the Sanitary Inspector. I am strongly of opinion that the Inspector who has to deal with the landing of food stuffs at the riverside wharves, should, when necessary, inspect food exposed for sale in any part of the Borough, as his experience of what is being landed would enable him to say what foods when examined were likely to prove unsound. This work by the Pood Inspector should in no way relieve the Ward Sanitary Inspector of his duty in regard to the detection of unsound food. The whole of the time of the Food Inspector during the busy months of the year, is fully taken up, as it should be, with food coming into the district, whether by road, rail or river. In the two or three months when trade is quiet, the Inspector attends as well to the sanitary condition of the warehouses and residential property on the river bank. I am sure that excellent work has been done by the Food Inspector during the year under consideration in spite, I might almost say, of the small power he possesses in regard to foods in transit stored at the wharves and warehouses. We hope that the Bill now before Parliament will remedy the present state of affairs in regard to the inspection and seizure of unsound food whilst stored at the wharves. UNSOUND FOOD. TABLE 46.

The very important question of what is a proper and sufficient supply of water for a house in which each floor is let to a separate tenant, has been before the Boroughs since the decision of the magistrate in the Woolwich case. During the year 1906, in Southwark, upwards of three hundred houses let out in separate floors, where the only water supply was from a tap either in the yard or in the basement, have been served with notices calling upon the owner to provide a sink and a supply of water for the tenants of every floor of the house. In more than a hundred houses the notices have been complied with, much to the comfort and cleanliness of the families occupying them. In the case of 151, Blackfriars Road, the top floor being let to a separate tenant, and the only water supply to the house being from a tap in the basement, the magistrate on a summons being taken out by the Council to compel the owner to provide a tap and a sink on the top floor, decided that there was not a proper and sufficient supply of water for the top floor letting. and an order was made calling upon the owners to provide one. The owners appealed against the magistrate's decision, and the appeal was upheld when heard in the King's Bench Division. The following is a report of the case, to which is appended the circular letter and abstract received from the London County Council in relation to this matter :— "In the King's Bench Division judgment has been given in the case of Messrs. Field & Sons (appellants) and the Southwark Borough Council (respondents), on a case stated by Mr. Chapman, Magistrate at the Tower Bridge Police Court, with respect to the water supply at No. 151, Blackfriars Road, owned by the appellants. The magistrate held that the supply was insufficient, there being none on the top floor. "The Lord Chief Justice, in giving judgment, said: I do not think this decision can possibly be supported. I doubt very much whether the learned magistrate has considered the real and proper question. In coming to the conclusion that this decision cannot be supported, I do so mainly upon the ground that I think he has mixed up two different matters, and has not, in coming to his decision, really regarded the different state of things which may arise in consequence of those two different matters. "Now, taking the appellants, Messrs. Field & Sons, they have let this house to a Mr. Brown, and they have let it on terms that he is not to sub-let without their leave; and, without expressing any opinion as to 101 whether there would be evidence of waiver, or anything of that kind there is no finding that they had assented to the underletting by Mr. Brown, and there is no finding, nor is it consistent with the facts, that they were in receipt of the sub-rents in respect of any sub-letting, and therefore if they are going to be hit as the technical owners, they do not come within the words 'the person for the time being receiving the rack rent of the premises,' if the top floor is to be dealt with or treated as separate premises. I entirely agree that they are in receipt of the rack rent of the house, and that they are liable for any structural defect in the house as let. Now, the learned magistrate has found this: 'I held that although the water supply of the said house would have been sufficient if the said house had been in the occupation of one tenant only, yet the top floor being let separately, the supply of water was not proper or sufficient; and I further hold that the want or defect was of a structural character, and that the appellants were the owners of the said house.' "I think, with very great deference to the learned magistrate, who I know is extremely careful, that he has mixed up two things. He has forgotten, or, rather, has not sufficiently observed, that if he is dealing with the owners as the owners of the house, they are not the people who are in receipt of the rack rent of the premises, the top floor, which has been underlet, or, in other words, while he is quite right in saying that the appellants are the owners for the purpose of any defect in the water supply to the house, yet he is not entitled to make what I may call a constructive house for the purpose of increasing the burden upon the owner; and that is made I think abundantly clear by the eighth paragraph, where he says: 'If I was wrong in holding that a nuisance had been committed upon the whole of the said premises, then the said top floor, being let as a separate tenement, was an occupied house within the meaning of section 48.' Now, there is no definition of 'house' as far as I know, except in section 141, which, if I remember right, says that 'house' includes schools, factories, and other buildings in which persons are employed. That, I think, is the only definition. "I really am at a loss to understand how, remembering the Waterworks Clauses Act and the Public Health Acts, it can be said that for the purpose of the obligation of an owner you are to deal with an underlet room as a house occupied for the purpose of this nuisance question. It seems to me to be straining technicalities to the last extent to hold that if, without my consent, my tenant has underlet a room in my house that that becomes as against me an occupied house, to which I can be called upon to put a pipe, although the very next moment or the very next day it may cease to be an occupied house. I think 'occupied house' means 102 the structure as let, and I think the learned magistrate, when he found that as let by Messrs. Field & Sons there was a sufficient supply of water, ought to have said, "I cannot call upon these owners to fulfil an increased burden due to an act which they are not shown to be responsible for." Whether or not any order could have been made against Mr. Brown because he had let the room without a proper water supply I express no opinion at present. All I say is that the magistrate has gone too far when he has held that an owner who has let a house with these restrictions becomes an owner liable to put in a fresh water supply because the tenant has underlet one of the rooms in the house. I think therefore that this appeal must be allowed, and the order must be quashed. "Mr. Justice Darling: I am of the same opinion. "Mr. Justice A. T. Lawrence: I agree. "Mr. Herbert: The appeal will be allowed, with costs ? "The Lord Chief Justice: Yes." (Copy). "LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL, County Hall, Spring Gardens, 8.W., 1th February, 1905. Sir, I have pleasure in forwarding herewith a copy of an extract from the report of the Public Health Committee, which was adopted by the Council on the 31st ultimo, on the subject of the supply of water to tenement houses. In accordance with the resolution passed by the Council, I am to call the attention of the Southwark Metropolitan Borough Council to the decision of the magistrate at the Woolwich Police Court on 16th December, 1904, to the effect that the supply of water from a tap in the yard is not a proper and sufficient supply within the meaning of section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and I am to express the Council's hope that the Borough Council will take all possible steps to secure the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water for the tenants of every floor of a tenement house. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) G. L. Gomme, Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Southwark." 103 EXTRACT from Report of the Public Health Committee oj the London County Cauncil. "WATER SUPPLY TO TENEMENT HOUSES. "1. On 10th May, 1904 (p. 770), we brought to the notice of the Council the report by the Medical Officer of Health, as to the result of an enquiry by Dr. Young respecting the sanitary accommodation in houses originally built for one family, but now let in separate tenements to several families. One of the important facts disclosed in that report was the inadequacy of the arrangements for the supply of water to the tenants of the upper floors in such houses; there being in many, if not most, of such houses but a single tap, and that in the basement or on the ground floor. "The supply of water to inhabited houses is regulated by the provision of Sections 2 and 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Section 2 provides that, where there is a constant supply of water, absence from premises of water fittings shall be a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under the Act, and Section 48 (1) provides than 'an occupied house without a proper and sufficient supply of water shall be a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act, and if it is a dwelling house, shall be deemed unfit for human habitation.' "We were doubtful whether these provisions were sufficient to enable sanitary authorities to require a supply of water to the tenants of each floor in tenement houses, and on 14th June, 1904 (pp. 971-2), the Council decided to promote legislation on the subject, but its resolution was subsequently rescinded on 6th December, 1904 (pp. 3012-3), as the Parliamentary Committee reported that they were advised that it was by no means clear that the present law was insufficient to meet the case, and as we were endeavouring to get the matter tested at the instance of one of the Metropolitan Borough Councils. "We are now glad to report that on 16th December, 1904, as a result of proceedings by the Woolwich Metropolitan Borough Council respecting the water supply of a tenement house, No. 1, High Street, Woolwich, the magistrate decided that the supply of water from a tap in the yard was not a proper and sufficient supply within the meaning of the section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act. 1891, and he made an order to abate the nuisance, and ordered the defendant to pay £5 5s. costs. 104 "Dr. Hamer, the Council's Assistant Medical Officer of Health, gave evidence supporting that given by the Medical Officer of the Borough Council, and the following extracts from the proof of Dr. Hamer's evidence show the conditions which he found on visiting the premises in question on 13th December, 1904. "'The house is a three storey house; a single man occupies the ground floor rooms. A woman and her child occupy the first floor front room; the first floor back room is separately let. In the top floor front there are a man and wife and two children (one of the children is, however, not always at home), and in the top floor back there is a single man. The only appliance for supplying water for domestic use to the occupiers of these five sets of tenements is that situated in the back yard of the house. All water for cooking, drinking, personal ablution, washing clothes, and scrubbing floors has to be fetched from the yard; there is no wash-house, and the copper in the yard is in a dilapidated condition.' "'The tenants of the top floor store water in a pail, which is kept on the landing at the top of the staircase; this staircase is very dark and the pail is uncovered, and water stored in this manner is liable to become polluted.' "'The conditions as regards cleanliness of the rooms and staircase are unsatisfactory, and this is not surprising having in view the need of carrying water from the yard all the way upstairs! The case is an important one and we think that the attention of all the Metropolitan Borough Councils should be called to it.' "We, therefore, recommend — "That a letter be addressed to the Metropolitan Borough Councils calling their attention to the decision of the Magistrate at the Woolwich Police Court on 16th December, 1904, to the effect that the supply of water from a tap in the yard is not a proper and sufficient supply within the meaning of section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and expressing the Council's hope that they will take all possible steps to secure the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water for the tenants of every floor of a tenement house. [Adopted 105 Series of Bye-Laws re Drainage. The Borough Engineer and the Medical Officer of Health, at the request of the Public Health Committee, made the following report in reply to a letter received from the London County Council in regard to our practice and opinion in requiring manholes and interceptors to new and reconstructed drains:— With reference to the construction of Bye-law 5, the question of the advisability of amending this Bye-law so as to do away with the intercepting trap is one which must be approached with great care, although there are a great many points in favour of abolishing the intercepter. One of the most important of these is that freer ventilation would be possible, and secondly, the question of the intercepter acting as a retainer of sewage and allowing decomposition to take place. Both these are important factors, and there is no doubt that under perfect conditions of drains and sewers, with perfectly sound drains and sewers and guaranteed construction, theoretically it would be an advantage to have a free flow of air from the sewer passing out through the outlets provided for the ventilation of the drains. If these conditions are not possible, it would be in our opinion a great risk to do away altogether with the intercepter. It is impossible that all sewers and drains shall be absolutely perfect, for however well constructed in the first place the work is bound to deteriorate a.nd defects will arise, whereby the sewage is held and allowed to decompose and to give off dangerous gases which would find their way into private premises. Again, the time for sewage to pass from some distant parts of London to the outfall is such that the sewage must have decomposed when passing through the sewers of other districts. With regard to the access to the trap, this is one of those unfortunate double arrangements which so often occur in the L.C.C. Bye-laws, and which have tended in the past to so many failures in litigation and so much expense to the local authorities. The latter part of the section does not explicitly say what is required. In section 4 of the L.C.C. Bye-laws, in the last paragraph under the head of "drains under Buildings" it is stated, "means of access must be provided at each end of the drain beneath a Building." When this access does not provide adequate means of access to the trap it is stated in section 5, "a separate manhole or other separate means of access to such trap for the purpose of cleansing it shall be provided." As the Bye-law stands it is not compulsory to provide a 106 manhole near the intercepter, provided the means of access to the trap is proved adequate, in the opinion of the Magistrate, for its cleansing. In places where a number of branch drains concentrate at the front, or where the outlet of the drain is 9 to 10 feet deep, a manhole, we think, must be provided to give adequate access to the drain and trap. Differences of opinion exist as to whether a manhole should be provided in all cases at the outlet of the drain near the intercepter. In the Paddington case where a vertical plunging arm was provided on the house side of the trap, it was held by the Magistrate that adequate means required by the Bye-law had been provided. The practice in Southwark has been on the side of providing a manhole at the front and back of the building in all cases. In all newly built houses no difficulty has been experienced in obtaining them. In reconstructing drains of old houses we always demand in our notices these two manholes, but we are frequently met by the refusal on the part of the owner to provide the one at the outlet of the drain near the intercepting trap, the owner providing in lieu thereof a vertical plunging eye on the house side of the trap and a raking arm to the outgo of the intercepter. We consider that such access to the trap and drain by these two arms is a makeshift arrangement, and is quite inadequate when the intercepter is plugged by such things as milk tins, or where as before stated, many branches concentrate in the front, or where the trap is 9 or 10 feet below the surface. We have always considered a manhole near the intercepter as absolutely necessary. Our conclusion, therefore, is that while the intercepting trap should remain, additional powers should be provided for its being constructed in a proper chamber. Lord Llangattock's Property. The method of testing and the condition of the house drains. During 1906 the sanitary staff was particularly active in having the drains of a large number of the older houses of the Borough exposed for inspection. With very few exceptions the drains constructed more than fifteen years ago were found to have the joints open, the pipes irregularly laid, and the whole leaky and defective. The exposing and the examination of the drains of a large number of Lord Llangattock's houses in Trafalgar Street, consequent on an outbreak of Enteric Fever, must have led to the action taken by his agent, Mr. Dickins, in regard to 38, London Boad. I am glad to say that the matter terminated in a very friendly 107 arrangement which, I believe, has been loyally kept by both sides, and which has worked very satisfactorily. The correspondence here printed fully records the incident. Mr. Dickins' first letter of complaint. (Copy). 155, Old Kent Road. S.E. 23rd November, 1906. Dear Sir, Bolls Estate and Southwark Borough Council. 38, London Eoad. On 16th inst. I wrote you that a final notice had been served on these premises that I had tested the drains without obtaining any result, and I suggested that your Inspector should meet my Representative on the premises and again test them. He did so on 20th inst., and no result being obtained and hearing nothing further from you I concluded that the matter was at an end. To-day, however, the tenant has shewn me a notice stating that his drains would be exposed after 24 hours by order of the Sanitary Authorities. I will say nothing of the lack of courtesy you have shewn in dealing with the Representative of an Estate the owner of which has invariably done his utmost to act in a spirit of amity with the 'Public Authorities, but it appears to me that when all other efforts to discover a defect fail, to resort to Section 40 of the Public Health Act, 1891, is an abuse of power never contemplated when that Act was framed. To expose drains that have been in existence many years is as oppressive and unreasonable an action as to water test them, such drains though they may be perfectly efficient being sure to be technically defective, though by no means so much so as to cause a nuisance or to be injurious to health. I submit that in conferring almost unlimited power on the Sanitary Authorities Parliament contemplated it being used reasonably and fairly. Lord Llangattock has been and is always anxious to assist Public Bodies in improving the surroundings of his tenants, but he has not unnaturally hoped that such bodies would act with him, and in a spirit of fairness and moderation, and that their efforts would be directed to secure the welfare and prosperity of the householders of Southwark. 108 In the hope that the order respecting the drains at No. 38, London Road, has been given without your authority, and awaiting your reply, I am, Yours faithfully, (Signed) E. DICKINS. Dr. G. Millson. Medical Officer of Health in reply to Mr. Dickins. (Copy). Borough of Southwark. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walwokth Road, 24th November, 1906. Dear Sir, 38, London Road. I think that you have magnified this matter of the uncovering of the drain of the above house. You are justified at looking at it from the landlord's point of view. We, of course, are equally justified in looking at it from a Public Health point of view. We have reasonable grounds for calling in question the soundness of the drain. It is an old drain. It is unventilated and not intercepted. It has been reported upon, after a test by the sanitary inspector, as being suspiciously unsound. We have no desire to proceed under Section 40 of the Public Health Act if that is offensive to you. We are quite disposed to leave the uncovering of the drain to you, and for us to have the opportunity of inspecting it when uncovered. We consider that, as health officers, it is essential to have the condition of the drain thoroughly ascertained. I acknowledge all that you have said in regard to the Estate and the goodness of Lord Llangattock, but after all we must revert to what is right in the interests of Public Health. If you do decide to have the drain uncovered we must ask for that to be done without any delay. Yours faithfully, (Signed) G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. E. J. Dickins, Esq., 155, Old Kent Eoad, S.E. 109 Mr. Dickins' letter to the Town Clerk. (Copy). 155, Old Kent Road, S.E., 28th November, 1906. Dear Sir, Rolls Estate and Borough of Southwark. Anxious as I am at all times to act amicably with the Borough's officers, I am compelled to ask you to bring before your Council my protest against the system of persecution being pursued by their Medical Officer of Health against Owners and their Lessees in Southwark. I need not, I feel sure, dwell upon Lord Llangattock's desire to act with your Council for the welfare of the Borough, nor remind you that since the beginning of 1902 he had expended large sums as to which no legal obligation rested upon him, in carrying out the arrangement set forth in my letter of 4th March, 1902, whereby he undertook that in the case of sewers when a chemical test showed that danger to health existed he would not avail himself of his legal right to disclaim responsibility, but would, subject to the Authorities agreeing to such an arrangement, relay or repair the sewer conditionally to the Authorities undertaking to repay half the amount so expended. No Officer of Health could be more anxious than the owner of the Bolls Estate for the welfare of bis tenants. His Lordship, I think, naturally expected to be met by the officials in a spirit of equity and goodwill. His experiences have proved how ill-founded were these expectations. The ingenuity of the Sanitary Authorities appears to be exercised to the utmost to obtain employment for their inspectors at the cost of "Owners" where a drain is found technically imperfect the law is brought into force to compel its repair or reconstruction, often at heavy and unnecessary cost—where the "drain" is found to be a "sewer" and the liability for repair rests with the Borough nothing has been done in any case which has come under my notice to remedy real or supposed evils, excepting when Lord Llangattock has consented to pay a moiety of the outlay. 110 In February last drastic and, as I thought, unwise requirements were made as to paving yards, and these I resisted on the score of expense, and still more because of the hardship to tenants. Lord Llangattock obtained Counsel's opinion, and your officers finding threats ineffectual allowed the matter to drop. In July notices were served demanding extensive alterations to the system of water supply. Again Counsel's opinion was taken and again your officers retired from their position. Had they been dealing with a poor owner instead of a substantial one they might have coerced him into submission. I now complain of your Medical Officer's abuse of the powers conferred on him by Section 40 of the Public Health Act, 1891. I enclose copy of my letter to him of 23rd inst., to which he replies that he is quite disposed to leave the uncovering of the drain to me for the Authorities to have the opportunity of inspecting it when uncovered, and from this reply I can only conclude that your officer thinks my letter unworthy of a reasonable answer. In my letter of March, 1902, I accepted the chemical test as the proof of the owner's moral responsibility, or irresponsibility, for bearing a share of the cost of improvements, and I have since abided by that test. In the case of 38, Loudon Road, the chemical test having failed to prove the existence of a nuisance your officer, being determined to have the drain relaid, actually falls back upon Section 40 of the Public Health Act. Parliament bestowed practically unlimited powers upon the Public Authorities because it thought they would be exercised fairly and for the good of the people. Owners have no appeal so long as officials do not exceed their legal powers, but if they are exercised so oppressively as is threatened in the case of No. 38, London Road, Lord Llangattock must cease from his attempts to co-operate with the Authorities and retire from the arrangement of 4th March, 1902. Possibly your present Council is not aware of the manner in which the Public Health Acts have been administered in this Borough, and I ask you to bring this letter before it with my request that it will give such directions as it thinks right to its officers with 111 the object of securing the fair and reasonable treatment of owners and their tenants. Kindly inform me when my protest will be brought to the notice of your Council, and when I may hope to receive its reply. Yours faithfully, (Signed) R. DICKINS. J. A. Johnson, Esq. (Copy). Medical Officer of Health's report in reply to Mr. Dickins' letter to the Town Clerk. Borough of Southwark. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walworth Road, 10th December, 1906. Gentlemen, Mr. Dickins' charge against me of pursuing a system of persecution against owners and their lessees in Southwark is a very grave one, and must be very fully enquired into to see whether the grounds upon which the allegation is based are of a substantial nature and justify the charge, or that the allegation is simply due to irritation caused by the action the Council have always directed me to take in regard to house to house inspection The action taken by this department in regard to the drains of Lord Llangattock's houses has always been precisely similar to that adopted in connection with houses of other property owners of the Borough, and in no single instance have the other large property owners complained that our mode of procedure in the examination of defective drains was other than fair or reasonable. It is singular, that, although this method of uncovering drains has been going on for the last twelve years in the Borough, this is the first time that any public complaint has been made as to its being improper and unfair. The inspections made to ascertain the condition of the drains of Lord Llangattock's houses have always followed either on a complaint, or on the presence of infectious disease, or have been a part of the systematic inspection of the district by the sanitary inspector. 112 It is the practice of the sanitary inspector when called upon to examine a house to do so thoroughly, and not to leave the house until he is satisfied that it is, in regard to its drainage and its cleanly condition, sanitary, and in all respects fit for habitation. It is only on rare occasions that I give directions to the sanitary inspector as to how, or in what directions, he should carry out his house to house inspection. The Council have always insisted upon a complete report being made as to the drainage and the sanitary appliances of the house. This thorough examination and the subsequent carrying out of necessary work has been found to lead to great economy in working, and has prevented the too frequent repetition of visits. It has also had a beneficial effect on the health of our inhabitants, as shewn by the decrease in the death-rate of six per thousand during the last few years. The reconstruction of the drainage of old houses, especially during the last ten years, has proceeded very rapidly, nearly a thousand houses being dealt with every year. I am quite within the estimate when I say that two-thirds of the house drains of the Borough have been reconstructed under the Council's regulations now in force within the last twelve years. We have always held that where a house drain was constructed more than twenty years ago, and where it is unventilated and not intercepted, and especially where a test has given a result, that a portion of the drain should be uncovered so that its actual condition could be ascertained. At one time we used to prefer to water-test a drain, but as owners so persistently objected to it we are content to have a portion of the drain uncovered so that we can see the condition of the joints. This might be thought to be hardly necessary in old drains as every house drain constructed more than twenty years ago was constructed with clay joints, and of course, by the lapse of time, the clay has become perished and been washed away, leaving the joints quite open. No drain of that kind could be allowed to remain without leakage of sewage into the surrounding subsoil, constituting a serious menace to the health of the residents of the house. I know of no large property owner, with the exception of Lord Llangattock, who has not accepted these old clay-jointed drains as nuisances creating serious danger to health, and who has not readily assented to a reconstruction of such drains at his own cost. The chief property owners in Southwark such as Mr. Yates Messrs. Sutton & Dudley, Mr. Sansom, Mr. Norris, Messrs. Gledhill and others have never, in my recollection, objected to a drain being 113 exposed for examination when the sanitary inspector has been convinced of its defective condition; nor have they wished at any time to throw the cost of the reconstruction of combined drains upon the shoulders of the Council. It says much for the care and ability of the sanitary inspectors that in all the drains asked by them to be uncovered in no case has the owner been in a position to recover damages against the Council for wrongful opening. With regard to the drain testing by a chemical test, this is of a most uncertain character, and is governed by the nature of the subsoil, the absence of an intercepter, and especially by the condition of the atmosphere at the time. Drains that have been tested in this way with a negative result have been found, when uncovered, to be broken and defective and the surrounding subsoil saturated with sewage. Lord Llangattock's property has unfortunately not progressed in the same active way towards improvement as has been the case with that of other owners. There is still on Lord Llangattock's estate a large number of old houses with very defective drainage. In regard to these old houses which have been in the hands of Lord Llangattock for some years, and many of which have been examined by the sanitary inspector and seen by Mr. Long and myself during the present year, a large proportion of them had the drains defective. In one street (Trafalgar Street) of more than a hundred houses I have strong reasons to attribute an outbreak of Enteric Fever, which occurred this summer, to the contaminated condition of the subsoil arising from leaky drains. In this particular street 120 houses were inspected ; the drains of 58 houses were uncovered, with the result that 36 of them were found very defective. In only three of the houses in which the drains were so defective did the chemical test reveal the condition of affairs. The uncovering of the drains under Section 40 of the Public Health Act was necessary in order to discover their actual condition. Such is the state of the drains in a portion of this street that I have directed the inspector not to have any drain reconstruction carried out until winter has commenced, as I feel sure, should the ground be disturbed in the autumn an epidemic of Enteric Fever would ensue. In the uncovering of a drain our practice is to dig a trench about six feet in length in order that at least two joints of the drain can be exposed, the condition of these two joints is taken as a sample of the rest. It is not our practice in any way to break into the drain or damage the joints, the ground is generally filled in on the same day and the surface made good. No damage being done to the drain. 114 Much of Lord Llangattock's property has drainage of the "combined" character. For the Local Authority to have the enormous expense of redraining the property for him would be little short of a scandal, especially where Lord Llangattock is either in receipt of, or on the eve of receiving the rack rent of the property. In many instances the Council has not been advised to reconstruct much of this defective combined drainage as the property itself was so old as to require demolition In regard to 38, London Road, the sanitary inspector visited the premises on the 15th October on house to house inspection. On putting a chemical test into the drain he found distinct evidence of an escape of the smell of the tester into the open air. On the 16th October an intimation notice was served to amend the drain, and on the 12th November a statutory notice was served. On the 22nd November nothing having been done by the owner a notice was served upon the occupier under Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and Section 82 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, to the effect that the drain would be uncovered for inspection. Prior to this, on the 20th November, the inspector had had an interview with Mr. Salmon, Mr. Dickins' agent, when the drain was again tested, but no smell from the tester was noticed. This may be accounted for by the heavy and altered condition of the atmosphere and the large amount of rain which had fallen about that time. The case of 38, London Road being a single drain, and not having had the branches relaid and the end of the main drain uncovered, there could be no similarity between the case of that house and those included in the arrangement come to in Mr. Dickins' letter of March, 1902, as will be seen on a reference to a copy of that letter which I append hereto. I have had twenty years' experience in the construction of house drainage, and I say that when any doubt exists as to the soundness of a drain it is the accepted and the best practice to have the drain in a portion of its extent uncovered for inspection; no walking over the ground or putting a chemical test into the drain will sufficiently declare its condition. I need hardly say that it is the duty of a medical officer of health not only to remedy nuisances brought to his notice, but to search for insanitary conditions likely to endanger the health of the inhabitants, and it is these sections 40 and 82 before mentioned 115 which enable him to do so. I do not think that I have ever proceeded under these sections without having heard all that the inspectors had to say on the matter. One would think that our actiou was irregular. It is the practice in vogue, and without it your sanitary work would be at a standstill and many insanitary conditions would go undiscovered. I may ask what would have been the state of Southwark if these sections had not existed. I believe this power has been fairly used, for if it had not, the assistance of a magistrate would have been invoked to stop us. That the health of our inhabitants has been improved thereby there can be no doubt. When a case of defective drainage has been before the Court, and the defect has been disputed, the magistrate has at times directed an adjournment to take place in order that the condition of the drain might be seen by all parties, and he has regarded the evidence as incomplete until the drain has been examined in that way. I can hardly suppose that the Council will take upon itself the responsibility of refusing to exercise the powers conferred upon it by these sections, enacted as long ago as 1855, and confirmed in 1891, proving the necessity of uncovering the drain before a proper examination can be made. I think the solution of the difficulty rests entirely with the magistrate. If the ordinary course is taken and the matter come before him under Section 115, the health officers will be obliged to state the reasonable grounds upon which they base their application to him. If they have no reasonable grounds, their application will fail aud no warrant will be granted. I do not think it is advisable that the Council should endeavour to take the place of the magistrate who has much more experience in these matters. If the Council sees fit to reverse our practice it will, I am sure, have a very farreaching effect. With regard to the paving of yards in Eltham Street for which notices were served in the earlier part of this year, I may say that each house has a small back yard. Immediately after the houses were occupied I had a complaint (copy sent herewith) transmitted to me by the London County Council. I at once visited these backyards and found they were in a very dirty and unsatisfactory state and were being partly covered with gravel. This not being in accordance with the by-law, notices were served to pave the yards with an impervious material. The whole cf the summer being dry I thought it advisable to allow the matter to remain in abeyance until 116 the present winter before taking action so that, should the magistrate desire to see the yards, he would then be able to judge how far the by-law should be enforced against the premises. Within the last few days I have again seen some of these back-yards the surface of the ground of which is soft and contaminated with dung and garbage. I have no hesitation in certifying that they are a danger to health. They cannot be washed down and kept clean. In a few cases the occupiers themselves have paved with an impervious material the portion of the back-yard desired by us on account of the dirty conditions which previously existed. With regard to the water supply on the upper floors of a house let to several families, the Council was circularised by the London County Council to take steps to have this carried out. It has been done in a large number of houses to the great convenience of the tenants. Apart from the opinion of the London County Council I hold that a water supply and a sink only on the ground floor of a house, when the upper floor is occupied by a separate family, is not a proper and sufficient supply for the upper floor within Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and it cannot tend to the cleanliness of the person of such tenants, nor to the benefit of their general health, especially when the water for drinking purposes is stored on the landing or in the bedroom. These notices have not been pressed as we have a case now waiting on appeal. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, (Signed) G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. 117 The following are letters to which reference is made in the foregoing report of the Medical Officer of Health:— (Copy.) 1.— LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. Public Health Department, 8, St. Martin's Place, W.C. 12th February, 1906. Nuisances. Dear Sir, I am directed to inform you that an anonymous communication has been received by the Council, in which complaint is made as to the houses in Eltham Street, S.E. I enclose a copy of the complaint. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, (Signed) Shirley P. Murphy, Medical Officer of Health. Dr. G. B. Millson, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. 2.— (Copy.) To the Chairman of the Housing Committee London County Council. Sir, After considering the best course to pursue, I have come to the conclusion to lay the following case before you as Chairman of the Housing Committee of the County Council. Whilst acting as locum tenens to a professional friend in Walworth, I have had occasion to attend several cases of illness and death in a street in this locality (Eltham Street), where the houses have been quite recently rebuilt. My attention having been directed to the filthy and unpaved condition of the very small back yards as a most likely source of the 118 cause of illness and death, and investigating these yards I found them to be mud heaps of dirt and filth the accumulation of a century, particles of which are taken into the house continually, and the poor little children making mud pies with this concoction of filth. That the Public Health Authority to this district in London should allow new houses to be built without properly asphalted yards (where it is an impossibility to have gardens) is in my opinion nothing short of a crime. Every one of these houses I find was allowed to be occupied before they were finished. Yours truly, Locum Tenens. (Copy.) Letter shewing original arrangement with reference to Combined Drainage. 3 155, Old Kent Road, S.E. 4tli March, 1902. Dear Sir, Rolls Estate and Borough of Southwark. Combined Drainage. On 24th ulto., I wrote you in reply to your letter of 19th ulto., as to "combined drainage" of property of which Lord Llangattock was not the "Owner" as the term is defined by the Act, and as to which drainage he had no control. To-day I am writing as to the requirements of the Sanitary Authorities, as to shop property in the London Road the rack rents of which are received by Lord Llangattock who, therefore, in this case, is the "Owner'' as defined by the Act. It appears that a house to house inspection is being made, that notices are being left on the houses, and that it is being suggested that the Owner in addition to the works for which he is legally responsible shall relay the combined drains or "sewers." So far as I have at present ascertained most of these houses are drained by a system of combined drainage, and the responsibility for the condition of the main portion, or "sewer," rests with the Sanitary Authorities. 119 In all matters connected with his Estate, Lord Llangattock places the welfare of his Tenants before his personal interests and always wishes to meet the Authorities in a fair and reasonable manner without taking advantage of legal freedom from responsibility if be considers that such freedom prevents equitable arrangements being come to. In reporting upon the fair and proper mode of dealing with combined drains, however, I have drawn attention to the fact that Public Authorities frequently allow "sewers" to remain unrepaired after having unsuccessfully called upon "Owners" to do the work, and that the reason for this is probably that in the majority of cases after the branch drains have been repaired and ventilated it is found to be unnecessary in the interests of the public health to relay or disturb the "sewer." In all cases where, after the branch drains have been repaired and ventilated, no "result" is obtained from a smoke or chemical test (i.e. where it is demonstrated that no escape of gas into the premises is possible) Lord Llangattock will not undertake to execute any repairs to the sewers. In cases, however, where the above test shows that danger to health still exists, Lord Llangattock will not avail himself of his legal right to call upon the Public Authorities to execute the whole of the necessary works to the "sewer" but will, subject to the Authorities agreeing to such an arrangement, relay or repair the "sewer" conditionally on the Authorities undertaking to repay him half the cost of the amount so expended, and not to claim any rights over the site of such repaired "sewer" or "sewers." By such an arrangement the Public Authorities would escape expenditure for which they are legally liable, the "Owner'' would to some extent be protected from requirements to execute work not actually necessary for the preservation of public health, and the primary object of securing the safety of Lord Llangattock's Tenants from the dangers of defective drainage would be obtained. I shall doubtless hear from you at your convenience in reply to these suggestions. Yours faithfully, (Signed) R. Dickins. G. Millson, Esq. 120 The correspondence and the report of the Medical Officer of Health were referred to the Public Health Committee with the following result. Report submitted to and approved by the Council. Rolls Estate and Borough of Southwark. Your Committee have to report that they have again had under their consideration the reference back to them from the Council of the correspondence which has passed between the Council and Mr. R. J. Dickins, the agent to Lord Llangattock, with regard to the Rolls Estate and the Borough. The Committee felt that the best course to pursue was to arrange an interview with Mr. Dickins, and to discuss the whole matter with him. A conference accordingly took place on January 8th, 1907, between Mr. R. J. Dickins, who was accompanied by Mr. Raymond Barker, legal adviser to the Estate, and a Sub-Committee appointed to represent the Council. It will perhaps be remembered that Mr. Dickins in his communication to the Council on the 28th November, stated that "possibly the present Council is not aware of the manner in which the Public Health Acts have been administered in this Borough." At the outset of the meeting Mr. Dickins withdrew the word "present," to which as the Council are aware great exception had been taken. Mr. Dickins in his letter also referred to a "system of persecution," by the Medical Officer of Health, but after some discussion, he also agreed to withdraw these words and to substitute " line of action." Mr. Raymond Barker, on behalf of Mr. Dickins, informed your Committee that the two main questions at issue were as follows, viz :— (1) Are drastic requirements to be made upon owners to remedy technical defects in drains while sewers, for the repair or reconstruction of which the authorities are liable, are allowed to remain grossly defective ? (2) Are the authorities and private owners to act together in a spirit of amity and reasonableness as suggested in my letter 121 of 4th March, 1902, or are both parties to claim their technical rights and refer all matters of difference to a Magistrate as suggested by Dr. Millson? The whole matter was exhaustively gone into between your Committee, Mr. Raymond Barker and Mr. Dickins, and eventually Mr. Dickins intimated that subject to Section 40 of the Public Health Act of 1891 being only resorted to in cases where the existence of defects has been proved to exist or where the drain passes under a house in which an outbreak of diphtheria, typhoid or enteric fever has occurred, he was willing to agree:— (1) To the chemical test being repeated once, or even twice, in cases where the Medical Officer is dissatisfied with the result of the first test, but in such cases the test would of course be made jointly by representatives of the Authorities and the Estate. (2) To undertake to ventilate and intercept drains of which Lord Llangattock is the "Owner," subject to the understanding that the authorities shall require no further works to be executed, if, after the works of ventilation and interception have been completed and the ground has been filled in, no result is obtained from a chemical test. A conference at this point took place between Mr. Dickins and the Medical Officer of Health, with the result that an amicable arrangement has been come to on the following basis, as expressed by Mr. Dickins in a letter received from him on the 11th instant, viz.:— (1) ''I agree, when so requested, to ventilate and intercept all old clay jointed, unventilated and non-intercepted drains, and to relay the branch drains connected therewith. (2) That while the trench is open for the reconstruction of the drainage up to the back wall of the house, the drain under the house, after being plugged, is to be tested by a chemical test, and if no smell escapes, the drain under the house is to be considered for all practical purposes sufficiently sound, and is not to be disturbed. In cases, however, where the smell of the tester escapes, Lord Llangattock will adhere to the agreement contained in my 122 letter of 4th March, 1902, with respect to carrying out the necessary works, the Council paying half the cost and not claiming any right over the site of such repaired combined drain." The Committee feel that the Council may be congratulated on a satisfactory settlement of an extremely difficult and delicate business, and they— Recommend— That the terms of the arrangement arrived at between Mr. Dickens and the Medical Officer of Health be approved and adopted. Obstructing an Officer. The following case at the Lambeth Police Court exemplifies the difficulty a Sanitary Inspector often experiences in the course of his work:— "Sanitary Inspectors' Powers. "William G. Selby, an ex-Sanitary Inspector, of Beresford Street, Walworth, was summoned for obstructing George Fisher, a Sanitary Inspector in the service of the Southwark Borough Council, in the execution of his duty.— Mr. G. C. Topham, Solicitor to the Council, appeared in support of the summons, and Mr. Burton Ward defended.—Inspector Fisher stated that on the 18th ultimo he went to some premises in Prince Regent Buildings for the purpose of inspecting some drainage works which were being carried out under a notice served by the Council. Upon walking into the back yard he saw the defendant, who was apparently supervising the work on behalf of the owner of the premises, standing at the end of the yard. He called out to the defendant, 'Good morning,' and walked towards the drain trench. The defendant exclaimed, 'You go off the premises. I have written to your superiors telling them I will not have you here. He told the defendant that he should decline to go until he had inspected the drain, and the defendant then instructed the workmen to remove him from the premises One of the workmen took him by the arm, and when he showed some resistance pushed him out of the place.—Mr. Hopkins: I don't understand the position, Mr. Topham. You serve a householder with notice to put his drains in repair, and he proceeds to do it. Can the Sanitary Inspector go to watch?—Mr. Topham: Yes, sir; 123 that is my submission.—Mr. Hopkins: I mean as a right. If you serve me with a notice to put my drains in order, and I set about it, may your Inspector come to watch? It may be that I am unwise in not letting him, but may he come and watch as a matter of right?— Mr. Topham: I submit so. Look at the difficulty. If they complete the work and cover it in, how are we to see that it has been properly done without going to the expense of uncovering it?—Mr. Hopkins: Yes, there is that difficulty about it, but I don't see what right a Sanitary Inspector has, when a person who is carrying out work under a notice from the Council, to go and watch.—Mr. Topham: I submit that it is a necessary incident of carrying out the Act.— Mr. Hopkins: But in order to obstruct an Inspector, you see, he has got to be 'duly employed in the execution.' Surely he is not 'duly employed in the execution' in going to the premises of a person who is doing drain work under a notice.—Mr. Topham : The Inspector, I submit, is in the due execution of that which is implied by the man's very title— Inspector.—Mr. Hopkins: But he may not go and watch the householder doing the work, surely?—Mr. Topham: I submit, yes, Sir.—Mr. Hopkins: I don't think so.—Mr. Topham repeated that if work was covered up without being inspected it would be difficult, without going to the expense of uncovering it, to know whether it had been properly carried out.—Mr. Hopkins: You go there again if you have reason to suppose there is another nuisance, and if you find another nuisance you proceed again. The point is whether the Inspector is in due execution of the Act when be watches the householder doing work under your notice. Surely he is not?—Mr. Topham: I take it that inspection is necessary in all stages of the work.—Mr. Hopkins: I want to leave out the question whether it is wise for the householder to keep the Inspector off his premises. I want to put the question whether he can go there as a right.—Mr. Topham: Surely we have the right to inspect and re-inspect as often as we like?—Mr. Hopkins: Surely the Council are functus officio for the purposes of a particular nuisance when they give their statutory notice and leave the business in the hands of the householder?—Mr. Topham: Yes, sir; but a fresh cause of nuisance might arise in the course of the work, for which a fresh notice might be necessary.—Mr. Hopkins: The householder's answer would be—'I am doing the work for which you have given me notice, and I am doing it in my own way. If there is anything wrong, you can come down afterwards.'—Mr. Topham: Very well, sir, if your worship takes that view.—Mr. Burton Ward, in justice to the defendant, mentioned that Inspector Fisher had been informed 124 that he would receive notice when the work was ready for inspection, but in spite of that he went to the premises on the day in question.'—Mr. Hopkins then dismissed the summons, but without costs." The Magistrate was clearly right in his decision that the Sanitary Inspector in this case, where permission to visit was refused, had no right of entry to the premises, and was not duly employed in the execution of the Act. The power of entry was made clear in the case of the St. Pancras Vestry (Vines) v. The North London Collegiate School, when the Judge ruled that where the entry to premises was refused, power could only be obtained under Section 115 by a warrant after the Magistrate was satisfied on oath that there was reasonable ground for such entry. In the Wimbledon case it was decided that the question of the right of entry may arise at any time even if the officer had previously gained admission. Mr. Hopkins, the Magistrate in our case, mixed up the "right of entry" under Section 10 with the "reasonable ground" under Section 115, only the former being applicable to the case. It will be necessary in future, where there is refusal to admit the officer to the premises, that the reasonable ground should be sufficiently substantial to merit a warrant being issued by the Magistiate. 125 PUBLIC HEALTH ACT. During 1906, 117 summonses were taken out against owners of property and other persons for contraventions of the Public Health Act and By-Laws made thereunder. The following table shows the number of summonses taken out in the several wards:— TABLE 52. WARDS. St. Mary's. St. Paul's. St. Peter's. St. John's. Trinity. All Saints' St. Michael's. St. Judes.

Of the remaining 57 summonses, penalties were inflicted in 20 cases. Magistrates' orders were made in 33 cases, the premises were ordered to be closed in 1 case, 2 summonses were adjourned sine die, and one summons was dismissed (see pages 122 and 129.) 126 TABLE 53.

All the bakehouses of the Borough were visited by the Chairman of the Committee, myself and Mr. Weatheritt. With the exception of two or three they were all in a good structural state, and with those exceptions mentioned in the following table they were all in a clean and satisfactory condition. At the present time a good many of the troughs in the bakehouses are on casters, but we think that an. effort should be made by the Inspector to get all of them so fitted to enable the troughs to be readily removed from the walls. A bakehouse being a dusty place, there is so great a disposition on the part of the flour to settle that the greatest attention is needed in keeping every part of the floor and the walls behind the troughs swept and dusted. Regulations might well be framed for the proper dusting and cleansing of the bakehouse, and I shall be prepared when this report is considered with certain suggestions for the keeping of bakehouses in a more cleanly state.
