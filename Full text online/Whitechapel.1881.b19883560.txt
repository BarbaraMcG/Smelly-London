WHI 29 BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 1st JANUARY, 1881, BY JOHN LIDDLE, medical officer of health. LONDON: Penny & Hull, Steam Printers, 53, Leman Street, Whitechapel. F,. 1881. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Quarter ended lst January, 1881. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, Gentlemen, In the Quarter that ended on Saturday, the 1st January, 1881, the total births in the District were 621, viz., 316 males and 305 females; and the deaths 502, viz., 274 males and 228 females. The excess of births over deaths has therefore been, during the Quarter, 119. As the deaths of 115 non-residents, which occurred in the London Hospital, are included in the mortality returns, a deduction of such deaths must be made in order to estimate the correct mortality of the District, thereby reducing the total mortality to 387, and thus increasing the number of births above deaths to 234. An allowance, however, must be made for the deaths of residents in public institutions outside the District; but of those I have no return. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the total births were G55, and the total deaths 697. The weekly average of births was 50.3, and of deaths 53.6; and in the present Quarter the weekly average of births has been 47.7 and of deaths 38.6. In the Spitalfields sub-District the births were 164, and the deaths 80; in the Mile End New Town 178, and the deaths 119 (in this subDistrict the Workhouse is situated); in the Whitechapel North 103, and the deaths 41; in the Whitechapel Church 64, and the deaths 199 (in this sub-District the London Hospital is situated); in the Goodman's Fields 74, and the deaths 41; and in the Aldgate 38, and the deaths 22. The deaths have exceeded the births in the Whitechapel Church sub-District by 135, but the deaths of the 115 non-residents in the London Hospital must be deducted from the total deaths in that Institution ; the proportion of births to deaths is therefore 64 to 84. 4 The deaths in the London Hospital have been 169; of these 115 were of non-residents, 26 of residents, and 28 of persons who either died suddenly or from the result of accident. The deaths of persons who resided in this District, previous to their admission into the London Hospital, form but a very small proportion of the total deaths in that Institution. Excluding the deaths caused by accident (the previous residences of persons so dying not always being given in the weekly returns), the proportion of deaths of residents in this Quarter is 15.3 per cent. In the last Quarter ended 2nd October, the proportion of deaths of residents to non-residents was only 10.2 per cent. The deaths in the Workhouse have been 75. In the corresponding Quarter of last year they were 74. The deaths from epidemic diseases in the entire District have been 35; viz.: 1 from small-pox, to which must be added 4 deaths which occurred in the Small-pox Hospitals, thus making 5 deaths from small-pox ; 11 from measles, 6 from scarlet-fever, 5 from diphtheria, 1 from hooping-cough, 6 from diarrhcea and 8 from fever, including 3 which occurred in the Fever Hospitals. The number of patients suffering from small-pox and from fever, who were removed from this District to the Asylum Hospitals, will be seen on page 9. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the deaths from epidemic diseases were 97 ; viz.: 0 from small-pox, 26 from measles, 31 from scarlet-fever, 6 from diphtheria, 14 from hoopingcough, 13 from diarrhcea, and 7 from fever. Mortality of Young Children. The mortality of children under 1 year of age was 79. This is 15.7 per cent, of the total mortality. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year it was 17.9 per cent. In the Spitalfields subDistrict the rate is 26.2 per cent.; in the Mile End New Town 16.8 per cent. ; in the Whitechapel North 21.9 per cent.; in the Whitechapel Church 3.5 per cent.; in the Goodman's Fields 43.9 per cent.; and in the Aldgate 18.1 per cent. The difference in the rate of mortality of young children in the Mile End New Town and Whitechapel Church sub-Districts is thus explained :—in the former the Workhouse is situated, and in the latter the London Hospital; in both these Institutions the children under 1 year bear only a small proportion to the adults, 5 The total deaths under 5 years are 168, which shows a rate of mortality of 33.4 per cent, in relation to the total deaths, including those of non-residents, and 27.0 per cent. to the total births. The rate of mortality under 1 year, in relation to the total births, is 12.7 per cent. Pauper Illness in the District. The Medical Officers of the Union have attended during the past Quarter 904 new cases of illness out of the Workhouse ; including 16 of small-pox, 16 of measles, 8 of scarlet-fever, 19 of diarrhœa, 36 of febricula, 6 of fever, and 10 of erysipelas. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year the number of pauper cases of illness was 1056; including 2 of small-pox, 76 of measles, 18 of scarlatina, 9 of hooping-cough, 26 of diarrhœa, 36 of febricula, 3 of fever, and 2 of erysipelas. The total number of cases of illness in the Workhouse has been 878 ; including 3 of measles, 1 of hooping-cough, 21 of diarrhoea, 2 of fever, 15 of erysipelas, and 8 of febricula. In addition to the above cases, there were 52 of syphilis and gonorrhœa; thus making a total of 930. Uncertifred Deaths. Two uncertified deaths are recorded during this Quarter; 1 in Mile End New Town and 1 in the Whitechapel Church subDistrict. Meteorology of Greenwich. The Returns of the Registrar-General show that the rain-fall in the Metropolis during the Quarter has been 12.54 inches.* One inch deep of rain-fall on an acre weighs (allowing 10-lbs to a gallon, which is the weight of a gallon of distilled water) nearly 101 tons. During the corresponding Quarter of last year the rain-fall was 2.24 inches. The average annual rain-fall at Greenwich in 63 years was 25.4inches. The mean temperature of the air was 43°.7. Inthecorresponding Quarter of last year it was 41°.0. The coldest days during the Quarter were Tuesday, the 2nd November, Sunday, the 21st of November, and Tuesday, the 9th November, when the thermometer indicated respectively 25°.0, 25°.8, and 26°.5. The coldest day during the corresponding Quarter of last year was on Saturday, the 6th December, when the thermometer indicated 13°.7, or 18°.3 below * In October, falls of rain exceeding one inch in 24 hours were of frequent occurrence. Rain fell on every day from the 8th to the 26th November. 6 the freezing point of water. The lowest mean temperature during any week in the Quarter was in that which ended November 4th, when it was 31°.2. Table of Weekly Mortality, &c., in London and in the Whiteciiapel District.

In the Whitechapel District, as will be seen from the subjoined Tables, diarrhœa has been much more prevalent during the year than in the preceding one. This is especially noticeable as regards children under one year of age. The great increase in the number of cases of diarrhœa occurring in the third quarter of the year caused me some little feeling of anxiety, looking on it as a possible precursor of cholera, as diarrhoea was always very prevalent before the out-break and during the continuance of cholera, as may be seen on reference to my report on that disease ; but fortunately the diarrhoea subsided, and the cases have been, during this Quarter, not above the average number. i A Table showing the deaths from diarrhoea in the Whitechape District for the Four Quarters of the year ended Saturday, ist January, 1881, and the ages at death:— QUARTERS ENDED 0 and under 1 year. 1 year and under. 2. 2 years and under 3. 3 years and under 4. 4 years and under 5. 6 years and under 7. 7 years and under 8. 12 years and under 13. 13 years and under 14. 14 years and under 15. 30 years and under 40. 50 years and under 60. 60 years and under 70. 70 years and under 80. total. 1880.

From the Vaccination Tables kindly prepared for me by Mr. Vallance, the Clerk to the Board of Guardians, it appears that re-vaccination is well attended to in this District. In my Report for the Quarter ended July, 1880, it appears, " from the Vaccination Returns which were laid before the Board of Guardians and by them submitted to the Local Government Board, that during the year 1879, 2735 births had been registered in the Union. Of that number 2409 had been successfully vaccinated ; one was unsusceptible of vaccination ; 227 died (or 8.3 per cent, of the number born); 22 had been postponed, and 26 had removed to other districts, or gone abroad. This Report, so far as the vigilance of the Vaccination Officer is concerned, in tracing the children whose births were registered in the District, and inducing the parents to obtain vaccination for their children, is highly satisfactory, and reflects great credit upon all those who are intrusted with the working of the Vaccination Act ; for it shows that only 61, or 2.2 per cent, were lost sight of; and as the authorities of those Districts where it was ascertained the children had been removed to were apprised, it is probable that some of the children were vaccinated in their new abodes." At the Meeting of the Board of Guardians held on Tuesday, 1st February, 1881, Mr. Vallance reported that in the half-year to June, 1880, there were 1,464 births, and 1,298 successful vaccinations; 113 died ; 9 were postponed by medical certificate; 9 had removed to districts, the Vaccination Officers of which had been apprized ; 33 removed to places unknown, and 2 were unaccounted for. Mr. Vallance ventured to say that no Union could show a better, if as good, a a return, and for a migratory district like Whitechapel, a loss of 2 and 2½ per cent, reflected the highest credit on the Vaccination Officer. This opinion is in accord with that of every person who has had experience in the difficulty of inducing parents in poor neighbourhoods to obtain the benefits of vaccination for their children. It was further stated by Mr. Vallance " that during the year 82 children had been born alive in the Infirmary, and that (with the exception of 2 who died before vaccination) they were all successfully vaccinated before discharge. Beyond this, children admitted are always inspected, and during the year 96 children under one year old had been vaccinated." Greater benefit may be expected to result from the vigilance of the Vaccination Officer during the intervals of small-pox epidemic, in promoting vaccination, than during the actual prevalence of the disease. It will be found that more cases of vaccination are performed under the panic caused by the existence of small-pox, than when the epidemic has passed away ; and thus it happens that many nnprotected persons are left as victims to the next epidemic. 9 VACCINATION.

The plans of the Peabody Buildings in the course of erection in Royal Mint Street under the scheme of the Metropolitan Board of Works having been considered by the Board, it was resolved that the Medical Officer of Health and the Surveyor should inspect the places and report their views thereon to the Committee of Works. The subjoined is the Report of the Medical Officer of Health and the Surveyor on the matter referred to them. JOINT REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND SURVEYOR. To the Committee of Works. Gentlemen, In accordance with the resolution of the Board relative to the Peabody Buildings, near Royal Mint Street, under the Scheme of the Metropolitan Board of Works, we have inspected the Buildings now in course of erection on the West side of Glasshouse Street, and Blue Anchor Yard, and report that we find upon an area of 48,680 superficial feet, a space of 18,000 superficial feet is covered by the Buildings, leaving an area of 30,680 superficial feet as an open space. That in the construction of the Buildings attention has been paid to their sanitary arrangements ; but we would suggest as an improvement in future buildings of a similar character that the water closets should not be within the Buildings, but attached thereto, and provided with two windows opposite each other, and, where practicable, they should have windowed lobbies in addition, as suggested by Mr. Simon, late Medical Officer to the Privy Council, so that a thorough ventilation may be obtained. The rooms vary in size, being 13-ft. by 11-ft., 13-ft. by 9-ft. and 11-ft. by 10-ft.; and the rooms, excepting the top story, are 9-ft. 6-in. in height, and those are 8-ft. 6 inches in height. The average cubical contents of the upper rooms are therefore 1048-ft., and the average of those on the lower floor 1171-ft. A new public sewer has recently been constructed by tha Metropolitan Board of Works in Glasshouse Street, in place of a pipe drain (which formerly existed there). The arrangements for the drainage of the Buildings, we consider, are satisfactory. We are not in possession of the fact whether or not provision has been made for the ventilation of the soil pipes and drains ; but we consider it advisable that the soil pipes and drains should be ventilated above the roofs. With the exception of the water closets, we consider the general arrangements of the Buildings are satisfactory. Wo are, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, 17th November, 1880. (Signed) JOHN LIDDLE, S. W. IRON. 11 A copy of the above Report was sent to the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Peabody Donation Fund Society. This Society, after expressing thanks in a letter addressed to the Whitechapel Board of Works for a copy of the Joint Report, state, that if the officers of your Board will again visit the Buildings after they are occupied, they will find that all the soil pipes and drains are ventilated above the roof, and that no foul air or gas can enter the rooms. The trustees desire to express their wish that all future dwellings for the poor may have the closet accommodation as perfect as it will be found in the Whitechapel Buildings. There can be no doubt that a new Building Act is imperatively demanded, for the existing Act is extremely defective. The defects of the Building Act have been pointed out, in several of my Reports, and suggestions made for their amendment, and I would respectfully refer all who are interested in this important matter to those Reports, especially to pages 8, 9, 10, and 11, in the Report for the Quarter ended December, 1872; and I would also refer you to an excellent leading article in the " Times " of Thursday, February, 3rd, 1881, on the importance of building healthy houses, the conditions of which, among other things, require provisions against injury from frost, whereby the domestic comforts of a family may be secured. The principal points mentioned are the protection of the water supply pipe against the effects of severe frost, so that the water in these pipes may be so protected as to prevent the expansion of the water in them by freezing, and consequent bursting of them, whereby the family is not only put to the greatest possible inconvenience, but their health suffers most materially. The walls of the house should be of adequate thickness to keep out the cold and wet, and prevent the wasteful escape of heat which is generated within the building—thick walls, substantially constructed of good materials, are the first essentials. The roof should be so constructed as to prevent the drifting of rain or snow under the slates and tiles. As the public at large cannot be expected to insist on all these details in the building of a house, the officers of local boards of health should be required to examine all houses in the course of erection, to see that all things requisite for health are duly attended to, and the Board should insist on all the essentials for health in the building of a house being regarded. The apathy of the public in matters of health is truly lamentable, 12 It is greatly to be desired and hoped for, that as education extends, many of the evils which are now so productive of ill health will be removed, and the happiness, comfort, and longevity of mankind, will be promoted. It is well known that much danger to the public health arises from defectively built houses, more especially as regards the construction of the foundations, drains, water closets, and walls. These dangers might be prevented, if during the building of houses all the sanitary arrangements were to be frequently inspected by the surveyor and health officers of the several local boards, whose duty it should be to ascertain not only that the foundations of all the houses in the course of construction were properly made, but that the drains were so laid, and constructed of such materials, as should prevent leakage ; and that the water-closets should be formed of proper materials and so placed, and trapped, as the emanations from them should not escape into the rooms or passages of the house. It is also necessary that the workmanship should be approved by the official inspectors, and that no house should be allowed to be occupied as a dwelling unless the same be certified by the local board, in regard to all its sanitary arrangements, as being, in every respect, fit for habitation. Unless more stringent regulations are made and acted on in the construction of houses the health of the people must necessarily suffer. In the construction of houses the only thing that appears to be considered by many builders is that of cheapness. It will certainly be found to be less expensive to prevent the building of unhealthy houses, than to so alter them after they are built as to render them fit for habitation. Sanitary Works Performed during the Quarter ended 1st January, 1881. The following return shows the amount of work done by the Sanitary Inspectors during the Quarter ended 1st January, 1881. Number of inspections of houses as shown in the official returns 2191 Houses specially visited 335 Houses specially re-visited 1340 Preliminary notices served, such notices embracing 359 premises 164 Compulsory orders issued, embracing 145 premises 41 13 Summonses heard at Police Courts, under Sanitary Act 3 ,, under Act for the prevention of Adulteration of Food, &c. 0 Cellars used as dwellings discontinued for such use 1 Cases of overcrowding and indecent occupation abated 1 Houses in which rooms or passages have been whitewashed 185 Rooms disinfected with sulphurous-acid gas, after the occurrence of small-pox, fever, and scarlet-fever therein 144 Articles, consisting of beds, bedding, clothing, &c., removed from rooms to the Stone Yard and disinfected in the Apparatus 4459 Yards of houses paved, or the pavement repaired 36 Drains in houses improved 63 Dust-bins provided 2 Privies lime-washed, cleansed and repaired 91 Water supply provided or improved 18 Nuisances from dung and other offensive matter removed 29 Area gratings, cellar flaps, &c., repaired 36 Animals (swine, fowls and a horse) kept so as to be a nuisance, removed 24 ANNUAL REPORT. The number of births registered in this District during the year 1881 (consisting of 53 weeks), has been 2733, giving an average of about 51 per week; and the deaths have been 2302, which is a weekly average of about 43, including the deaths of non-residents in the London Hospital (439). In the preceding year, consisting of 52 weeks, the births were 2722, giving a weekly average of about 52, and the deaths were 2426, or a weekly average of about 46, including those of non-residents (434). The births are therefore less by 11 than they were in the preceding year, and the deaths are 124 less. The rate of mortality in this year (consisting of 53 weeks), as will be seen in Table V, has been 24.3 per 1000; while in the preceding year it was 26.0 per 1000, and in 1873, which also consisted of 53 weeks, deducting in both years the deaths of non-residents, was 26.5 per 1000. 14 Uncertified Deaths. The number of uncertified deaths has been, during this year, 7. This is 0.3 per cent, of the total deaths. During the last year the number of uncertified deaths was 19, or 0.78 per cent. of the total deaths. In London, the per centage of uncertified to certified deaths is about 1.6 per cent. The uncertified deaths in this District have been registered as follows:— CAUSE OF DEATH. Cases. Ages. Exhaustion 1 12 hours. These Cases were attended by Midwifes. Do. 1 24 „ Convulsions after Birth 1 7 „ Do. from Birth 1 3 „ Convulsions and Exhaustion 1 12 „ Bronchitis 1 2 years. Syncope, Disease of Heart 1 73 „ The Medical Attendant not qualified. Total 7 Deaths from Epidemic Diseases. Of the total deaths recorded in this District during the year, there were 224 from epidemic diseases, viz.: 16 from small-pox, in which are included the 10 which occurred in the Hospital, thus making a total of 16 ; 26 from measles, 37 from scarlet-fever and diphtheria, 39 from hooping-cough, 90 from diarrhoea, and 16 from fever, including 4 which occurred in the Hospital. Small-Pox. In the first Quarter of this year (14 weeks) there were 4 deaths from small-pox; in the second Quarter 5; in the third Quarter 2, both of which occurred in the Hospital; and in the present Quarter there were 5, 4 of which occurred in the Hospital. 15 In the fifty-three weeks ended January 1st, the deaths in the District from small-pox were 16 ; of these 10 died in the Small-pox Hospital. In 1879, the deaths from small-pox were 7, including 6 which occurred in the Small-pox Hospitals. The deaths in London were 475, and in. the preceding year 454. Diarrhœa. The deaths from diarrhcea in the District have been 90. In the preceding year they were 67, while in the whole of London the deaths from diarrhcea have been 3780, and in the preceding year they were 1900. For further particulars respecting the deaths from epidemic diseases see Table VI. in the Appendix. Fever. The deaths from fever, including 4 which occurred in the Fever Hospital, have been 16. In the preceding year, the deaths from fever were 33, including 4 which occurred in the Fever Hospital. In the whole of London the deaths from fever have been 887. The death-rate from epidemic diseases, including those in Hospitals for the year, in relation to the total mortality, is 9.7 per cent., and in relation to the population 2.9 per 1000. Last year the death-rate from epidemic diseases, in relation to the total deaths, was 13.1 per cent. Pauper Illness in the District. The number of out-door sick paupers who have been attended by the Medical Officers of the Union is 3660. During the previous year the number was 3833. The extraordinary annual diminution in the number of the out-door sick paupers from upwards of 17,000 in the years 1867 and 1868, to 2060 in 1877, is a matter of great satisfaction to the ratepayers of this District. Illness in the Workhouse. The Cases of illness in the Workhouse during the year have been 3268, including 184 cases of syphilis and 15 of lead poisoning. 16 Sanitary Works performed during the Year 1880. Number of inspections of houses, as shown in the official returns 9322 Number of rooms found to be overcrowded, the space being less than 300 cubic feet for each person—nuisance in each case abated 24 Houses specially visited 1335 ,, re-visited 13653 Rooms disinfected with sulphurous acid gas after the occurrence of fever and scarlet-fever therein 245 Articles disinfected, consisting of beds, bedding, clothing, &c. 7345 Preliminary notices served, such notices embracing 1321 premises 741 Compulsory orders issued, embracing 664 premises 213 Summonses heard at Police Courts, under Sanitary Act 7 ,, under Act for the prevention of Adulteration of Food, &c. 5 Houses in which rooms or passages have been whitewashed 679 Yards of houses paved or the pavement repaired 130 Cesspools abolished 1 Drains in houses improved 257 Dust-bins provided 22 Privies lime-washed, cleansed and repaired 404 Water-supply provided or improved 66 Area-gratings, cellar-flaps, &c., repaired 95 Cellars used as dwellings discontinued for such use 9 Nuisances from dung and other offensive matter removed 114 Animals kept so as to be a nuisance removed 121 All the Cow-houses and the Slaughter-houses have been visited four times during the year. 17 In addition to this return, the Inspectors report that they have forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works several notices of dangerous structures, which notices the Metropolitan Board have promptly attended to.

Scarlet-fever and diphtheria in the earlier records of the Registrar-General were not separated, but were classed under one heading, viz.: scarlet-fever. For some years past these diseases have been recorded under separate headings. The deaths from scarlet-fever during this year were 24 and from diphtheria 13. In London, the deaths from scarlet-fever were 3073, and from diphtheria 551. 22 TABLE VII.

BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 2ND APRIL, 1881, BY JOHN LIDDLE, medical officer of health. LONDON: Penny & Hull., Steam Printers, 53, Leman Street, Whitechapel, E. 1881. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Quarter ended 2nd April, 1881. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. Gentlemen, In the Quarter that ended on Saturday, the 2nd April, 1881, the total births in the District were 694, viz., 361 males and 333 females; and the deaths 638, viz., 378 males and 260 females. The excess of births over deaths has therefore been, during the Quarter, 56. As the deaths of 126 non-residents, which occurred in the London Hospital, are included in the mortality returns, a deduction of such deaths must be made in order to estimate the correct mortality of the District, thereby reducing the total mortality to 512, and thus increasing the number of births above deaths to 182. An allowance, however, must be made for the deaths of residents in public institutions outside the District; but of those I have no return. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the total births were 846, and the total deaths 772. The weekly average of births was 60.0, and of deaths 55.1; and in the present Quarter the weekly average of births has been 53.3 and of deaths 49.0. In the Spitalfields sub-District the births were 195, and the deaths 106 ; in the Mile End New Town 182, and the deaths 188 (in this subDistrict the Workhouse is situated); in the Whitechapel North 105, and the deaths 50 ; in the Whitechapel Church 58, and the deaths 223 (in this sub-District the London Hospital is situated); in the Goodman's Fields 107, and the deaths 44 ; and in the Aldgate 47, and the deaths 27. The deaths have exceeded the births in the Whitechapel Church sub-District by 165, but the deaths of the 126 non-residents in the London Hospital must be deducted from the total deaths in that Institution ; the proportion of births to deaths is therefore 58 to 97. 4 The deaths in the London Hospital have been 174 ; of these 126 were of non-residents, 16 of residents, and 32 of persons who either died suddenly or from the result of accident. The deaths of persons who resided in this District, previous to their admission into the London Hospital, form but a very small proportion of the total deaths in that Institution. Excluding the deaths caused by accident (the previous residences of persons so dying not always being given in the weekly returns), the proportion of deaths of residents in this Quarter is 18.3 per cent. In the last Quarter ended 1st January, the proportion of deaths of residents to non-residents was 15.3 per cent. The deaths in the Workhouse have been 102. In the corresponding Quarter of last year they were 152. The deaths from epidemic diseases in the entire district have been 58; viz.: *5 from small-pox, to which must be added 9 deaths which occurred in the Small-pox Hospitals, thus making 14 deaths from small-pox; 33 from measles, 5 from scarlet-fever, 2 from diphtheria, 4 from hooping-cough, 1 from diarrhcea and 8 from fever; no deaths from fever occurred in the Fever Hospital of patients removed from this District. The number of patients suffering from small-pox and from fever, who were removed from this District to the Asylum Hospitals, will be seen on page 7. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year the deaths from epidemic diseases were 50; viz.: 3 from small-pox, 10 from measles, 7 from scarlet-fever, 3 from diphtheria, 23 from hoopingcough, 2 from diarrhoea, and 2 from fever. Mortality of Young Children. The mortality of children under 1 year of age was 86. This is 13.4 per cent, of the total mortality. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year it was 17.0 per cent. In the Spitalfields subDistrict the rate is 18.0 per cent.; in the Mile End New Town 12.7 percent.; in the Whitechapel North 26.0 per cent.; in the Whitechapel Church 6.7 percent.; in the Goodman's Fields 29.5 per cent.; and in the Aldgate 7.4 per cent. The difference of the rate of mortality of young children in the Mile End New Town and Whitechapel Church sub-Districts is thus explained:—in the former the Workhouse is situated, and in the latter the London Hospital; in both these Institutions the children under 1 year bear only a small proportion to the adults. * The residences of these 5 persons were as follows:—80, Pelham Street; 17, Swan Court, Whitechapel; 10, White's Row, Whitechapel; and 2 died in the London Hospital, both of whom were non-residents, one of whom resided in Lombard Street, City, and the other in John Street, Bethnal Green, 5 Rate of Mortality. The rate of mortality in the entire District, based on the population according to the present census, which is less by 5,297 than in 1871, is, deducting as usual the deaths of the non-residents, 23.9 per 1,000. The population in 1871 was 76,573, and is now only 71,276. The total deaths under 5 years are 185, which shows a rate of mortality of 28.9 per cent, in relation to the total deaths, including those of non-residents, and 26.6 per cent, to the total births. The rate ol mortality under 1 year, in relation to the total births, is 12.3 per cent. Pauper Illness in the District. The Medical Officers of the Union have attended during the past Quarter 1246 new cases of illness out of the Workhouse; including 46 of small-pox, 85 of measles, 3 of scarlet-fever, 6 of diarrhoea, 17 of febricula, and 5 of erysipelas. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year the number of pauper cases of illness was 1175; including 6 of small-pox, 14 of measles, 4 of scarlatina, 5 of hoopingcough, 9 of diarrhoea, 28 of febricula, 1 of fever, and 4 of erysipelas. The total number of cases of illness in the Workhouse has been 1025 ; including 1 of small-pox, 15 of diarrhoea, 8 of erysipelas, 1 of puerperal fever, and 10 of febricula. In addition to the above cases, there were 42 of syphilis and gonorrhoea ; thus making a total of 1067. Uncertified Deaths. Five uncertified deaths are recorded during this Quarter; 1 in Mile End New Town sub-District, 2 in the Whitechapel North subDistrict, and 2 in the Aldgate sub-District. Meteorology of Greenwich. The Returns of the Registrar-General show that the rain-fall in the Metropolis during the Quarter has been 5.43 inches. One inch deep of rain-fall on an acre weighs (allowing 10-lbs. to a gallon, which is the weight of a gallon of distilled water) nearly 101 tons. During the corresponding Quarter of last year the rain-fall was 4.05 inches. The average annual rain-fall at Greenwich in 63 years was 25.4 inches. The mean temperature of the air was 37°4. In the corresponding Quarter of last year it was 40°0. The coldest days during the Quarter were Monday, the 17th January, Wednesday, the 26th January, Saturday, the 15th January, and Thursday, the 20th January, when the thermometer indicated respectively 12Q7, 13°2, ]4°2, and 14Q4. The coldest day during the corresponding Quarter 6 of last year was on Tuesday, the 27th December, when the thermometer indicated 17°.2 or 14.°8 below the freezing point of water. The lowest mean temperature during any week in the Quarter was in that which ended January 22nd, when it was 18°.5. The Registrar-General, in his last Quarterly return of marriages, births, and deaths registered in England and Wales, remarks, "that so low a death rate for the first Quarter of the year has not been recorded since that of 1856, when a similar rate prevailed. This low death rate in the Quarter under notice is the more remarkable on account of the exceptionally severe frost that prevailed during a considerable portion of January. There were 40 frosty days during the Quarter, and the lowest reading on each of those days showed an aggregate of 278.3 degrees of frost. This amount of cold weather exceeds that recorded in the corresponding period of any year since 1855, when the aggregate degrees of frost were 404.7." The falls of snow throughout the Quarter were exceptional. Snow fell on 53 days, and the snow-storm of the 18th day of January was very remarkable. Nearly all the lines of railway out of London were blocked. Trains were embedded in the snow all night, and during the next day.

The question of the compulsory notification of infectious diseases has for some time past engaged the attention of the public interested in the prevention of the spreading of such diseases, and the importance of it was clearly manifested by the large deputation, consisting of members of the several Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, the members of the British Medical Association, members of the Association of the Medical Officers of Health, and members of the Social Science Association, to the President of the Local Government Board. That such information to the Sanitary authorities is absolutely required for the better protection of the public health is universally admitted by all who have paid attention to the subject. If facts were required to be adduced to show the necessity for such information being given, they could be abundantly furnished by Medical Officers of Health. In the Whitechapel District in the year 1877, smallpox broke out in a severe form in Spring Gardens, and it was not until a death occurred in that place that the Medical Officer of Health became informed of the existence of the disease. On inquiry it was ascertained that several days had elapsed since the disease had first manifested itself, and at the time of the visit of the Sanitary Officer, it was found that several persons had received the infection. I have no hesitation in saying that had I had information of the first case when it became known, and had it been promptly removed to a Small-pox Hospital, the extension of the disease would have been prevented. If this disease should occur in an establishment where a large number of persons live on the premises, and where an extensive business is carried on, I can readily understand the reluctance which would be felt by the proprietor to give information. At the same time, the information given to the sanitary authority would merely be a temporary inconvenience, since steps would be immediately taken to isolate the patient, and, thus, there would be little or no danger to the other persons living on the premises; but otherwise, the danger of such disease spreading would be very great, and the proprietor of the establishment would suffer much more inconvenience in his business by the extension of the disease in his establishment. If benefit has resulted in those towns where the law of compulsory intimation of infectious disease obtains, I see at present no good reason why the same law should not be extended to the 9 Metropolis, where there is more need of it, as small-pox has been far more severe in London than in other places in England. If legally safe for a person having a large establishment not to divulge the existence of an infectious disease among the inmates, it certainly cannot be morally right to do so, when it is so well known that such disease sometimes rapidly spreads, and death results therefrom. The existence of such a disease in a large establishment may be a great inconvenience to the proprietor, but the concealment of it may be the means of converting such private inconvenience into a public danger. The only means a Sanitary Officer has of learning the existence of infectious diseases among the middle and upper classes is by the occurrence of a death. If intimation were given of infectious disease in a private family to the local Medical Officer of Health, measures might promptly be taken to advise the family, with the concurrence of the medical practitioner in attendance, to adopt the best means for so isolating the patient as to prevent the disease extending to other members of the family. The isolation of patients in a hospital, when they cannot otherwise be kept apart, is what must be insisted on ; and the question of having a hospital in every district, or having a sufficient number of hospitals within, or a short distance from the metropolis, is one which is engaging the attention of the public. Some of the districts in London are so small in area and the population therein so dense, that the erection of a hospital in their midst would be impracticable. Hospitals, however, for the poorer classes must be provided, as it is impossible for them to isolate a case of infectious disease ; and we must bear in mind that small-pox is never entirely absent from London. Small Pox. Small pox has prevailed to a great extent in the Metropolis during the last four months, as is shown in the subjoined table; but on comparing the deaths from small-pox in London with those of the corresponding weeks of the year 1871, when the disease prevailed as an epidemic, it will be seen that the deaths have been considerably less in number, viz., 617 to 2400. 10 The following Table exhibits the Weekly Progress in London of the existing epidemic of Small-pox. 1881.

The total deaths in London in the year 1871 from small-pox were 7834, and in the first three months of that year they were 2400, while in the corresponding weeks of this year they were only 617. In the year 1877 the total deaths from small-pox in London were 2544, and in the first three months of that year they were 1192. The following is the plan adopted by the Inspector, with a view to prevent the spreading of small-pox. Upon visiting houses in which cases of small-pox occur, inquiries are made as to whether all the children in the immediate neighbourhood have been vaccinated, and if unvaccinated children are discovered the parents are advised to get them vaccinated without delay, and information of all such cases is sent to the Vaccination Officer. The same plan is adopted in all the private cases of small-pox that are attended by medical practitioners that come under 11 the notice of the Inspectors. In all cases where the infected person is not properly lodged, his removal to hospital is advised. The danger of sending clothes out of infected rooms is pointed out, and persons who take in mangling are cautioned to discontinue that practice while infectious disease exists in their house. Parents are also advised not to send their children to school during the existence of small-pox in their houses, and information of the existence of small pox is given at the school where the children attend. All the rooms in which small pox occur are disinfected, and the bedding, clothes, &c., in such rooms are removed to the disinfecting apparatus, and there subjected to such heat as will destroy the contagious matter in them; but when the bedding and clothes are found to be very old and in a very filthy state, such articles are destroyed, and new bedding is supplied. It has been found that by speaking kindly to persons, and explaining to them the necessity of precautions being taken to prevent the extension of the disease, the advice is kindly received, and usually complied with. The Medical Officers of the Union and the Relieving Officers promptly send to the Sanitary Officers of the Board information of all cases of infectious disease which come under their notice. A very satisfactory result of the inspection of houses, and the care manifested by the several officers of the District, is shown by the large number of successful vaccinations which are performed by the Public Vaccinator of the District; there being in the half-year ended June 18th, 1298 successful vaccinations out of 1464 registered births. For further particulars on this important subject, the Board is respectfully referred to page 8 of my last Quarterly report. Notwithstanding all the care that is taken to induce parents to get their children vaccinated, there is a large number of them who remain unvaccinated, and these are children who were not born in the District. At page XXXI. of the report of the Registrar-General for the year 1873, the following remarks are made:—"It is interesting to compare the mortality from small pox in various cities during the first Quarter of 1870. The annual death-rate from this disease in the first three months of the year was equal to 3 per 1000 of the estimated population in London, 8 per 1000 in Liverpool, and 13 in South Shields ; in Brussels it was 9, in Bombay 1.4, and in New York 0.8 per 1000 respectively. Returns from the Dutch towns were only received for January and February; during those two months the annual death-rate from small-pox was equal to 48 per 1000 in The Hague, 36 12 in Utrecht, 25 in Rotterdam, and 3 in Amsterdam. It is well known that among the lower classes in Holland a very strong prejudice exists against vaccination. It may be useful to inquire what might be the result in London if prejudice against vaccination, which is so strongly held by a few in this countiy, should ever become so widely spread as in Holland. If the same death-rate from small-pox had prevailed in London during the Quarter as existed in The Hague during January and February, the deaths from this disease within the Metropolitan Division would have been 38,828 during the 3 months, instead of the 2400 which actually occurred." At pages 11 and 12 of my Quarterly report ended April 1st, 1871, it is stated on the authority of the Registrar-General, that during the first three months the mortality from small-pox in the Whitechapel District was 95, including 12 deaths which occurred in the Small-pox Hospitals of persons belonging to the District; in London during the same period the deaths from this disease were 2400, which gives a mortality at the annual rate of 3.0 per 1000 of the estimated population. Large as was the mortality in this district and in London, it was small when compared with the mortality at Rotterdam and The Hague during the same period. In Rotterdam the rate of mortality from small-pox was 31.7 per 1000 of the population, and in The Hague 41.2. In both these cities vaccination is much neglected. As regards the extent of vaccination in this country the RegistrarGeneral remarks that the information respecting vaccination, or otherwise, in fatal cases of small-pox is necessarily incomplete, failing the co-operation of the medical profession. In but a small proportion of the cases does the certificate of the cause of death state whether the deceased has been vaccinated or not; and although the Registrars have in some cases been instructed to enter this information in the death register on the authority of the informant, it is to be feared that this is not always reliable. Frequently the informant is not aware of the fact; and it is suspected that in many instances vaccination is falsely stated to have taken place to conceal the neglect on the part of the parents, who have some dread of legal proceedings. Census Return for the Whitechapel District. From a preliminary statement of the result of the Census for 1881, kindly furnished to me by Mr. Vallance, the Clerk to the Board of Guardians, it appears that the population of this District is less by 5,297 than it was in 1871, the time when the last census was taken. 13 The density of the population is therefore reduced from 190 persons to an acre, to 176. The following Table shows the Increase and Decrease in each of the Parishes in the District. PARISHES. Population, 1871. Population, 1881. Inckease and Decbease. 1. Whitechapel 34,874 30,704 -4170 2.

Holy Trinity, Minories 417 449 * + 32 Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act (1875). Owing to the large number of houses which have recently been taken down under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act (1875), the diminution of the population in this District may, during the last two years, be accounted for. It appears that in the Goulston Street scheme about 111 houses have been closed or demolished, which were inhabited by about 922 persons; some of whom, it has been ascertained, have removed to different parts of the metropolis, and some, (chiefly foreigners) have left the country. In the Royal Mint Street scheme, 192 houses have been taken down, and the inhabitants numbering about 1,996, have migrated to other parts of the Metropolis. The new buildings erected by the Peabody Trustees in this locality are built to accommodate 286 families, or about 1144 persons. The houses in Butler's Buildings, 17 in number, and those in Rose Court, 7 in number, mentioned at page 10 of my report for June, 1879, have not yet been taken down. It appears, from inquiries I have made, that although upwards of 3,200 persons have been displaced by the pulling down of houses, no extra overcrowding has been discovered in the district; and it is a matter of some satisfaction to find that the population of this overcrowded district is diminished. 14 Open Spaces. The importance of preserving for the public use open spaces in the Metropolis, has been frequently mentioned in my Quarterly reports. Open spaces for the recreation of children are essentially necessary for their health and well-being. Unless open air places for amusement and recreation are provided for the children living in the crowded courts of London, their growth will be stunted, and neither their physical nor mental powers will be developed. I may further add that unless more open space is provided for each house which in the future may be built in London, and a prohibition put to the building over the back yards of many of the houses which now exist, and the prevention of houses from being built back to back, it will be found that, should the population continue to increase in the same ratio as is shown by the recent census, many parts of London will become so unhealthy that the local authorities will be compelled for the public safety to open out the confined localities, and keep them as open spaces. Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act. Mr. Battram reports that he has submitted to Mr. Young, the Analyst for the District, seven samples of milk for analysis; out of which three were found to be adulterated with water in the following proportions, viz.: one of 25 per cent., one 26 per cent, and one 18 per cent. Summonses were taken out against the several parties, and a conviction in each case was obtained. One of the parties was fined £5 and 2s. costs, a previous conviction having been obtained against him. One was fined £1 10s. and 2s. cost, and the other £1 and 2s. costs. Mr. Wrack reports that during the Quarter ended 2nd April, he purchased 9 samples of milk, and submitted the same to the Public Analyst for analysis. One of such samples was found to be adulterated with 7 per cent, of added water, one 11 per cent., one 17 per cent., one 20 per cent., one 22 per cent., and one 35 per cent. In the four worst cases summonses were issued against the vendors thereof, one of whom was fined 10s. and 2s. costs, two were fined 20s. and 2s. costs, and the other 40s. and 2s. costs. With regard to the other two cases the vendors have been cautioned. 15 Sanitary Works Performed during the Quarter ended 2nd April, 1881.

REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, for the QUARTER ENDED 2nd JULY, 1881, BY JOHN LIDDLE, medical officer of health. LONDON: Penny & Hull, Steam Printers, 53, Leman Street, Whitechapel, E. 1881. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Quarter ended 2nd July, 1881. TO THE BOARD OP WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. Gentlemen, In the Quarter that ended on Saturday, the 2nd July, 1881, the total births in the District were 674, viz., 315 males and 359 females; and the deaths 534, viz., 296 males and 238 females. The excess of births over deaths has therefore been, during the Quarter, 140. As the deaths of 101 non-residents, which occurred in the London Hospital, are included in the mortality returns, a deduction of such deaths must be made in order to estimate the correct mortality of the District, thereby reducing the total mortality to 433, and thus increasing the number of births above deaths to 241. An allowance) however, must be made for the deaths of residents in public institutions outside the District; but of those I have no return. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the total births were 676, and the total deaths 472. The weekly average of births was 52.0, and of deaths 36.3; and in the present Quarter the weekly average of births has been 51.8 and of deaths 41.0 In the Spitalfields sub-District the births were 197 and the deaths 95; in the Mile End New Town 168 and the deaths 144 (in this subDistrict the Workhouse is situated); in the Whitechapel North 109, and the deaths 43; in the Whitechapel Church 72, and the deaths 168 4 (in this sub-District the London Hospital is situated) ; in the Goodman's Fields 81, and the deaths 44 ; and in the Aldgate 47, and the deaths 40. The deaths have exceeded the births in the Whitechapel Church sub-District by 96, but the deaths of the 101 non-residents in the London Hospital must be deducted. The proportion of births to deaths is therefore 72 to 67. The deaths in the London Hospital have been 140; of these, 101 were of non-residents, 12 of residents, and 27 of persons who either died suddenly pr from the result of accident. The deaths of persons who resided in this District, previous to their admission into the London Hospital, form but a very small proportion of the total deaths in that Institution. Excluding the deaths caused by accident (the previous residences of persons so dying not always being given in the weekly returns), the proportion of deaths of residents in this Quarter is 10.6 per cent. In the last Quarter ended 2nd April, the proportion of deaths of residents to non-residents was 17.3 per cent. The deaths in the Workhouse Infirmary, Baker's Row, have been 67. In the corresponding Quarter of last year they were likewise 67. The deaths from epidemic diseases in the entire District have been 62 ; viz.: 3 from small-pox, to which must be added 14 deaths which occurred in the Small-pox Hospitals, thus making 17 deaths from small-pox ; 28 from measles, 1 from scarlet-fever, 7 from hooping-cough, 20 from diarrhcea and 3 from fever. No deaths from fever occurred in the Fever Hospital of patients removed from this District. The number of patients suffering from small-pox and from fever, who were removed from this District to the Asylum Hospitals, will be seen on page 8. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year the deaths from epidemic diseases were 27 ; viz.: 2 from small-pox, 1 from measles, 2 from scarlet-fever, 1 from diphtheria, 8 from hoopingcough, 12 from diarrhcea, and 1 from fever. Nine deaths from smallpox occurred in the Small-pox Hospital of persons belonging to this 5 District, thereby increasing the total deaths from this disease from 2 to 11. Mortality of Young Children. The mortality of children under 1 year of age is 110. This is 20.6 per cent, of the total mortality. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year it was 21.4 per cent. In the Spitalfields subDistrict the rate is 85.7 per cent.; in the Mile End New Town 19.4 percent.; in the Whitechapel North 18.6 per cent.; in the Whitechapel Church 7.2 per cent.; in the Goodman's Fields 40.9 percent.; and in the Aldgate 25.0 per cent. The difference of the rate of mortality of young children in the Mile End New Town and Whitechapel Church sub-Districts is thus explained:—in the former the Workhouse is situated, and in the latter the London Hospital; in both these Institutions the children under 1 year bear only a small proportion to the adults. Rate of Mortality. The rate of mortality in the entire District, for the year ended 2nd July, 1881, based on the population according to the present census, and recorded in the weekly returns of the Registrar-General, is, deducting as usual the deaths of the non-residents, 24.7 per 1000. The population in 1871 was 76,573 and is now only 71,350. The total deaths under 5 years, during the Quarter, are 215, which shows a rate of mortality of 40.2 per cent, in relation to the total deaths, including those of non-residents, and 31.8 per cent, to the total births. The rate of mortality under 1 year, in relation to the total births, is 16.3 per cent. Pauper Illness in the District. The Medical Officers of the Union have attended during the past Quarter 1064 new cases of illness out of the Workhouse; including 61 of small-pox, 46 of measles, 4 of scarlet-fever, 7 of 6 hooping-cough, 21 of diarrhoea, 30 of febricula, and 5 of erysipelas. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year the number of pauper cases of illness was 7G0; including 13 of small-pox, 5 of measles, 1 of scarlatina, 5 of hooping-cough, 13 of diarrhcea, 26 of febricula, 1 of fever, and 4 of erysipelas. The total number of cases of illness in the Workhouse has been 997; including 2 of small-pox, 4 of measles, 3 of hooping-cough, 12 of diarrhoea, including 1 of cholera or choleraic-diarrhoea, 4 of erysipelas, and 7 of febricula. In addition to the above cases, there were 28 of syphilis and gonorrhoea; thus making a total of 1025. Uncertified Deaths. Two uncertified deaths are recorded during the Quarter; 1 in the Spitalfields sub-District, and 1 in the Whitechapel Church subDistrict. Meteorology of Greenwich. The Returns of the Registrar-General show that the rain-fall in the Metropolis during the Quarter has been 4.10 inches. One inch deep of rain-fall on an acre weighs (allowing 10-lbs to a gallon, which is the weight of a gallon of distilled water) nearly 101 tons. During the corresponding Quarter of last year the rain-fall was 5,53 inches. The average annual rain-fall at Greenwich in 63 years wa3 25.4 inches. The mean temperature of the air was 53°5. In the corresponding Quarter of last year it was 52°7. The hottest days during the Quarter were Wednesday, the 1st June, Saturday, the 4th June, and Friday, the 1st July, when the thermometer indicated respectively 81°1, 83°9, and 82°6. The hottest day during the corresponding Quarter of the previous year was on the 30th June, when the thermometer indicated 87°5. The deaths from diphtheria in London during the Quarter were 143, none of which are recorded as having occurred in the Whitechapel District. The following Table, taken from the Returns of the Registrar General, shows the comparative result of the Quarter* 7 Table of Weekly Mortality, &c., in London and in the Whitechapel District.

The remaining 6 cases were all from one house, No. 18, Oxford Street. 1 Died.—Knight, Elizabeth Ada, aged 9 years (non-resident), from West Ham. With reference to No. 18, Oxford Street, in which six cases of fever have occurred, as recorded in the above Table, I directed the attention of Mr. Battram, the Sanitary Inspector, thereto, and he informs me that the patients were all removed to the Hospital, where one subsequently died. The bedding was removed and disinfected, the rooms were fumigated with sulphur, the old paper stripped from the walls, and the walls and ceilings cleansed. 9 The walls of the rooms in which the fever occurred have not been re-papered. There is no want of cleanliness in any portion of the house, and the water supply is on the constant service. There is a dust-bin in the yard, and the closet is provided with a pan and properly trapped. Previous to the fever breaking out, the drains were out of order, and Mr. Battram's attention was called to the fact. Upon visiting the premises he found the men at work cleansing them, and they are now in good order. This house consists of four rooms, besides the underground kitchens ; the front kitchen was illegally occupied. A notice was served on the landlord to discontinue the use of the room for habitation ; this order was obeyed, and the tenants were displaced, but on a subsequent visit this room was again occupied as a living room. This involved the serving of a second notice. Mr. Battram adds that the first case of fever occurred in this underground kitchen. The following Table exhibits the Weekly progress in London of the existing epidemic of Small-pox, and is continued from Page 10 of my Report for the Quarter ended 2nd April, 1881. 1881.

A Bill for the improvement of the Dwellings of the Working Classes was, in 1875, introduced by Mr. Cross, the then Home Secretary, and which resulted in the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Act. This Act, at present, has not been so productive of benefit as was anticipated, but the subject has lately received much additional attention, not only from the public but from the Local Boards and the Metropolitan Board of Works; and, moreover, has lately been brought under the notice of the House of Commons and referred to a Select Committee who have taken evidence thereon. It may, therefore, be reasonably expected, that considerable improvement in the working of the Act will be effected. The unhealthy dwellings which exist in this vast metropolis are, when we consider its wealth, a great opprobrium, and now earnestly calls for an effectual remedy which we may expect will soon be found. The Select Committee of the House of Commons appeared to be thoroughly in earnest in the matter, and they did not confine their attention to the mere taking of the evidence of those capable of affording practical knowledge of the subject, but they personally inspected several of the unhealthy areas which had been submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works for their consideration and approval, previous to clearing away the unhealthy houses from those localities. On the 7th July, the Select Committee of the House of Commons visited the Rosemary Lane and the Flower and Dean Street areas in the Whitechapel District. There can be no doubt that the large buildings which have been erected on the sites previously crowded by most filthy and unhealthy houses are an improvement, and if the class of persons who have been displaced by the pulling down of the filthy slums should occupy them, their health and physical well-being will be greatly benefitted. The question, however, may be raised—is the present plan, viz : the erection of large buildings, capable of lodging numerous families under the same roof, the best for providing habitations for the working classes, and is it desirable that so many persons of the same class should live together in close proximity? It may be further asked, is it desirable that facilities should be afforded for the crowding together in London of such a mass of people 11 of the poorer class who seem desirous of living in the metropolis ? The population of this city is already too large, and is increasing annually. In the census of 1871 the population of London was 3,254,260, and that of 1881 was 3,829,751, showing an increase in ten years of 575,491, and during the same period the density of the population has increased from 42 persons to an acre to 50.8. Unless more effectual means are adopted to prevent the building of houses so close together as is the custom at present, the health of the people will materially suffer. In my opinion, it would be in every respect much better if houses of a moderate size were built, capable of accommodating only three families in each, and so built that every house should have a certain open space exclusively belonging to it, where the water-closet, wash-house, and dust-bin should be placed. These conveniences should be detached from the house, but should be within the curtilage of the same, and should be used only by the tenants of each house. As privies in courts, which are built only for the use of the tenants in the court, are, for the most part, open to the public, they are at all times a nuisance, and the further erection of them should be prohibited. Unless stringent provisions are made in a New Building Act to prevent the erection of houses in localities where there is not sufficient space for the health of the tenants, the same class of unwholesome dwellings will be built as those which have been recently demolished at great expense, under the provisions of the Act now under consideration ; and the money which has been expended in clearing certain ill-ventilated sites will have been wasted; for after a time a similar process of demolition, as regards the newly constructed houses, will have to be repeated. At present, every piece of vacant ground large enough to erect a small house is speedily purchased and built upon without any efficient control; the Local Authorities having very little power to insist on proper provision being made for sanitary arrangements—in fact, houses can still be built back to back, there being no law in existence to prevent the creation of such a nuisance. A Bill for the amendment of the existing faulty Building Act should be introduced by the Government, and the Government only could successfully carry such a Bill, which shall contain efficient sanitary clauses, through the Houses of Parliament Owing to the formation of new streets, the clearance of several crowded sites, the increase of the population and the number of 12 immigrants continually pouring into London, the suburbs are being built upon to a very great extent. It is therefore most desirable for the maintenance of the public health, that any new Building Act should apply, not only to the Metropolis, but to the entire country. I may here remark that the rents of the wretched houses which are now standing in some parts of the District of Whitechapel are very high; so much as 5/0 per week is demanded for three small rooms, and these rooms are usually sub-let at 2/6 each. A single room is sometimes obtained for 2/0 per week. Other houses, of a similar description, are let at 6/0 per week, and the cost for two rooms varies from 4/0 to 7/6, while the rents of the rooms in the Peabody Buildings, in which the comfort and convenience of the tenants have been studied are infinitely better, and are not nearly so high. It has generally been supposed that the greater number of the people living in the densely crowded courts are engaged at work in the vicinity of their dwellings, but on inquiry I find that it is not the case. Many work at the river side as wharf and dock labourers, and on the river as stevedores and coal whippers. I was further informed that this class of persons, if they had to move further eastward would not be inconvenienced, as a number of them are employed in the East and West India Docks, and even as far as the Victoria Docks. The coal whippers have to go to various places down the river, sometimes as far as Gravesend. In my evidence recently given before the Select Committee of the House of Commons, on the subject of the working of the Artizans' Dwellings Act (1875), I stated that it would be much cheaper to many of the working classes, and infinitely better for their health, if they were to live in the suburbs, and ride either by rail or tram-car into London and back every working day. Not only by so doing would their health be improved, but their comfort would be greatly increased, and the additional expense which they would incur by riding into town would be recouped by the lower rent that would be incurred by lodging in the country. It appears from the Table of Fares published by the Great Eastern Railway, that Third Class Return Tickets for Workmen are issued daily on Week-days to Liverpool Street at 2d. each from all the intervening stations on the Great Eastern Line as far as Enfield. 13 Third Class Tickets, at the same price, are also issued to Workmen from Stratford Market, Stratford, and Coborn Road; and this accommodation is, I am informed, greatly appreciated, daily tickets becoming more and more used as new houses for the working classes increase. The Peabody Trustees have printed certain rules which are to be observed by the tenants of their buildings, all of which rules, if strictly observed, will prove not only beneficial to them individually, but will add to the comfort of all the other residents. Although great advantages are offered by the Peabody Buildings, I do not find many of the poor people, who have been displaced by the demolition of their houses, occupying these new Buildings. It is most earnestly to be desired that the work of demolishing the filthy slums in London, which has been fairly commenced in this District, will be persevered in by the Metropolitan Board of Works, until the whole of these unhealthy localities are entirely swept away. It is truly a good work, and I am encouraged to expect from the following remarks, contained at Page 38 of the last Annual Report of the Metropolitan Board, that the work will not cease until the entire demolition of the rookeries is accomplished. The report says, "It is understood a full inquiry will shortly be made into the whole subject, and that the Board will avail itself of the opportunity to suggest in general terms the new legislation, which (so far as the Metropolis is concerned), appears to be necessary to ensure the satisfactory operation of the Artizans' Dwellings Acts, and the attainment of the objects aimed at by the promoters." The above remarks will give general satisfaction to all persons who have taken an active part in endeavouring to improve the moral and physical condition of the lower class of labourers. Let the slums be demolished without unnecessary delay; for unless the crowded and unhealthy localities be entirely demolished, any better class of dwellings which may be erected in proximity to them will not be attractive, and consequently will not be tenanted. The nuisances must first be cleared away, and then the work of building new and healthy houses may be advantageously carried on. The Act passed in 1879, and known as "Torrens' Amendment Act" provided, among other things, for the opening out by the Local Authorities of closed, or partially closed, alleys or courts 14 inhabited by the labouring classes, and the widening of the same by pulling down any building or otherwise, leaving such open spaces as may be necessary to make such alleys or courts healthful. The provisions of this Act, if carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works, would prove very beneficial to the health of the crowded districts in the Metropolis; but as the working of this Act is intrusted to the several Local Authorities, it is not likely that the Act will be applied to any great extent. If "Torrens' Act" were to be incorporated with the Artizans' Dwellings Act (1875) and worked by the Metropolitan Board, such alterations in both these Acts being made as will lessen the expense to the ratepayers, London, in the course of a few years, would present a totally different aspect to what it does at present, and the rate of mortality would be greatly reduced. It cannot be expected that the Local Boards will carry out the provisions of "Torrens' Act," when the cost of doing so will fall entirely on the ratepayers of the district, perhaps a small and poor one, instead of the same being spread over the whole Metropolis, as is the case under the provisions of the Artizans' Dwellings Act; and so long as "Torrens' Act" is kept on the Statute Book unaltered, it will, to a great extent, be a "dead letter." It must strike every member of a Local Board how unjust such a proceeding would be, to charge its ratepayers with the necessary heavy expense for such improvements as would be for the benefit of the entire Metropolis. It is well known that diseases which are generated in the crowded localities do not stop there, but travel to all parts of the Metropolis, and persons living at a distance from the places which generate infectious diseases do not escape with impunity from the deadly effects of them. Moreover, it so happens that the poorest districts are those in which the greatest sanitary improvements are required, and it is just those which are the least able to defray the cost. As all London, therefore, is benefitted by uprooting unhealthy localities, so all London should contribute in rateable proportion to the cost. All the powers of "Torrens' Act" should be transferred to the Metropolitan Board of Works; and, in so doing, care must be taken not to allow compensation to be awarded for the condemned houses on the rent which is received from the tenants. It is well known that the poor pay a much higher rent for their dwellings in proportion to their incomes, than is obtained from the upper and middle classes. 15 Houses which were built for single families, and when so occupied were well suited for the healthy enjoyment of all the members of the family, are now let out in tenements, and are occupied by several families, for whom they are, in a sanitary point of view, totally unfitted for habitation, and it is just this class of houses which is the most difficult for Sanitary Officers to deal with in a satisfactory manner; for not only is each room overcrowded, and without sufficient ventilation, but the stairs are generally dark and in a filthy state; it being the duty of no one in particular to clean them. Such houses, I believe, are very profitable to the owners, for exorbitant rents are exacted from the tenants. It is true that such houses maybe registered under the provisions of the Sanitary Act (1866), and Bye-laws may be made by each Local Board for their regulation, but experience has proved that such Bye-laws are not entirely satisfactory. The Sanitary Act, as regards the Registration of Houses, has been put in force in this District, and very good results, as regards the procuring of a better water supply, have thereby been obtained. Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act. Mr. Battram reports that he has submitted to Mr. Young, the Analyst for the District, four samples of milk, three of bread, and two of butter, for analysis; one sample of milk was found to be adulterated with 15 per cent. of water. A summons was taken out against the vendor, a conviction obtained, and a fine of £1 10s. and 2s. costs was imposed. Mr. Wrack reports that during the Quarter ended 2nd July, he purchased five samples of milk, and four of bread, and submitted the same to the Public Analyst for analysis, all of which were reported to be genuine.

REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 1ST OCTOBER, 1881, BY JOHN LIDDLE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. London: Printed by Penny & Hull, 63, Leman St., Whitechapel, E. 1881. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Quarter ended 1st October, 1881. TO THE BOARD OP WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. Gentlemen, In the Quarter that ended on Saturday, the 1st October, 1881, the total births in the District were 586, viz., 272 males and 314 females; and the deaths 601, viz., 344 males and 257 females. The excess of deaths over births has therefore been, during the Quarter, 15. As the deaths of 102 non-residents, which occurred in the London Hospital, are included in the mortality returns, a deduction of such deaths must be made in order to estimate the correct mortality of the District, thereby reducing the total mortality to 499, and thus increasing the number of births above deaths to 87. An allowance, however, must be made for the deaths of residents in public institutions outside the District; but of those I have no return. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the total births were 590, and the total deaths 556. The weekly average of births was 45.3, and of deaths 2.7; and in the present Quarter the weekly average of births has been 45.0, and of deaths 46.2. 4 In the Spitalfields sub-District the births were 194, and the deaths 114; in the Mile End New Town 144, and the deaths 140 (in this sub-District the Workhouse is situated); in the Whitechapel North 78, and the deaths 40; in the Whitechapel Church 51, and the deaths 211 (in this sub-District the London Hospital is situated); in the Goodman's Fields 79, and the deaths 57; and in the Aldgate 40, and the deaths 39. The deaths have exceeded the births in the Whitechapel Church sub-District by 160, but the deaths of the 102 nonresidents in the London Hospital must be deducted. The proportion of births to deaths is therefore 51 to 109. The deaths in the London Hospital have been 174; of these, 102 were of non-residents, 25 of residents, and 47 of persons who either died suddenly or from the result of accident. The deaths of persons who resided in this District, previous to their admission into the London Hospital, form but a very small proportion of the total deaths in that Institution. Excluding the deaths caused by accident (the previous residences of persons so dying not always being given in the weekly returns), the proportion of deaths of residents in this Quarter is 14.3 per cent. In the last Quarter, ended 2nd July, the proportion of deaths of residents to non-residents was 10.6 per cent. The deaths in the Workhouse Infirmary, Baker's Row, have been 80. In the corresponding Quarter of last year they were 68. The deaths from epidemic diseases in the entire District have been 12C; viz.: 3 from small-pox, to which must be added the 7 deaths which occurred in the Small-pox Hospitals, thus making 10 deaths from small-pox; 20 from measles, 12 from scarlet-fever, 2 from diphtheria, 14 from hooping-cough, 66 from diarrhoea, and 9 from fever. No deaths from fever occurred in the Fever Hospital of patients removed from this District. The number of patients suffering from small-pox and from fever, who were removed from this District to the Asylum Hospitals, will be seen on pages 8 and 9. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the deaths from epidemic diseases were 98, viz.: 4 from measles, 9 from scarletfever, 4 from diphtheria, 7 from hooping-cough, 70 from diarrhoea, and 4 from fever. Seven deaths from small-pox occurred in the Smallpox Hospital of persons belonging to this District, Mortality of Young Children. The mortality of children under 1 year of age is 150. This is 24.9 per cent. of the total mortality. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year it was 24.8 per cent. In the Spitalfields subDistrict the rate is 35.9 per cent.; in the Mile End New Town 22.8 percent.; in the Whitechapel North 32.5 per cent.; in the Whitechapel Church 12.3 per cent.; in the Goodman's Fields 45.6 per cent.; and in the Aldgate 30.0 per cent. The difference of the rate of mortality of young children in the Mile End New Town and Whitechapel Church sub-Districts is thus explained:—In the former the Workhouse is situated, and in the latter the London Hospital; in both these Institutions the children under 1 year bear only a small proportion to the adults. Rate of Mortality. The rate of mortality in the entire District, for the year ended 1st October, 1881, based on the population according to the present census, and recorded in the Weekly Returns of the Registrar-General, is, deducting as usual the deaths of the non-residents, 27.0 per 1000. The population in 1871 was 76,573, and is now only 71,350. The total deaths under 5 years, during the Quarter, are 257, which shows a rate of mortality of 42.5 per cent. in relation to the total deaths, including those of non-residents, and 43.8 per cent. to the total births. The rate of mortality under 1 year, in relation to the total births, is 25.4 per cent. Pauper Illness in the District. The Medical Officers of the Union have attended, during the past Quarter 910 new cases of illness out of the Workhouse; including 21 of small-pox, 25 of measles, 7 of hooping-cough, 55 of diarrhoea, 32 of febricula, and 11 of erysipelas. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the number of pauper cases of illness was 821; including 2 of small-pox, 5 of measles, 8 of scarlatina, 2 of hoopingcough, 78 of diarrhoea, 31 of febricula, 1 of fever, and 9 of erysipelas. The total number of cases of illness in the Workhouse has been 7C8; including 1 of small-pox, 7 of measles, 1 of hooping-cough, 23 of diarrhoea, 2 of fever, 9 of erysipelas, and 10 of febricula. In addition to the above cases, there were 33 of syphilis and gonorrhœa; thus making a total of 801. 6 Uncertified Deaths. Two uncertified deaths are recorded during the Quarter; 1 in the Whitechapel North sub-District, and 1 in Goodman's Fields subDistrict. Meteorology of Greenwich. The Returns of the Registrar-General show that the rain-fall in the Metropolis during the Quarter has been 8.9 inches. One inch deep of rain-fall on an acre weighs (allowing 10-lbs to a gallon, which is the weight of a gallon of distilled water) nearly 101 tons. During the corresponding Quarter of last year the rain-fall was 7.99 inches. The average annual rain-fall at Greenwich in 63 years, was 25.4 inches. The mean temperature of the air was 59°7. In the corresponding Quarter of last year it was 61°3. The hottest days during the Quarter were Monday, the 18th July, Friday, the 15th July, and Tuesday, the 5th July, when the thermometer indicated respectively 90°2, 97°1, and 92°8. The hottest day during the corresponding Quarter of the previous year was on the 30th June, when the thermometer indicated 87°2. The highest mean temperature during any week in the Quarter was in that which ended Saturday, 16th July. In the corresponding Quarter of last year, the highest mean temperature in any week was in that which ended September 4th, when it was 67°3. The deaths from diphtheria in London during the Quarter were 137, 2 of which are recorded as having occurred in the Whitechapel District. The following Table, taken from the Returns of the RegistrarGeneral, shows the comparative result of the Quarter :— 7 Table of Weekly Mortality, &c., in London and in the Whitechapel District.

The deaths from small-pox in the Quarter ended on July 2nd, were, in this District, including those which occurred in the Small-Pox Hospital, 17, and for the Quarter now under consideration 10. In the previous Quarter, the number of patients admitted into the Small-pox Hospitals in London, was 10,947, while, in this Quarter, the number is only 9,393, showing a decrease of 7,554. The deaths in London during the same periods were 1,018 and 461. There is reason, therefore, for believing that the epidemic is on the decline.

The facts here recorded unquestionably deserve attentive consideration. *It is stated that in most of these cases the disease was imported from the Metropolis. 10 The population and number of persons to an acre in those towns in which deaths from small-pox occurred during the present Quarter, are set forth in the subjoined Table. The 12 towns in which no death from small-pox occurred, are Portsmouth, Norwich, Plymouth, Bristol, Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Leicester, Nottingham, Manchester, Salford, Sheffield, and Sunderland ; the population in each of these towns varies from 402,296 (Birmingham), to 75,934 Wolverhampton).

Dr. Buchanan, Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, in a Memorandum, dated 3rd June, 1881, on the present prevalence of small-pox in London among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons respectively, inserts the following Table :— TABLE of comparative Small Pox Death-rate among Londoners, Yaeeinated anc Unvaccinated respectively, for the 52 weeks ended 29th May. Death-rate of People of subjoined Ages. Per million of each age of the Vaccinated class. Per million of each age of the Unvaccinated class. All Ages 90 3,350 Under 20 years 61 4,520 Under 5 years 40} 5,950 11 Dr. Buchanan considers that the following lessons may be learnt from the above Table :— 1. "The vaccinated are much less liable to die of small-pox than the unvaccinated. 2. "Vaccination is not an absolute protection against small-pox. In recording the present illustration of a quite admitted fact, it will be convenient to refer to the possibility of difference in the degree of protection afforded by vaccination now-a-days as compared with former times." The data with which we are furnished do not enable us to form an entirely correct opinion as to the greater protection afforded by vaccination at an early period after its introduction, yet there is reason for believing that the protective influence of vaccination was greater in the beginning of this century than it is at the present time. In an Address on Micro-Organisms and Diseases, which Dr. Cameron, M.P., the President of the Health Department of the Social Science Congress, delivered at the Meeting which was held in Dublin, in October, 1881, remarked that, "whilst comparing the results of vaccination as performed in Dr. Jenner's time and in the present time, although the operation was not then so carefully performed as it now is, yet the protection conferred, as measured by the death-rate in cases of small-pox occurring in vaccinated persons, was ten times more efficient than that secured by the most complete form of vaccination practised at the present day, and twenty-five times greater than that afforded by our vaccination, good, and indifferent, as at present practised." Dr. Cameron accounts for the falling off in results by "a deterioration of the vaccine virus." In Dr. Jenner's time, one vaccination was deemed a sufficient protection during life, but now-a-days it is considered necessary to repeat the operation two or more times for the protection of the individual. Vaccination, however, still affords a great protection against small-pox, as is shown from the figures above tabulated by Dr. Buchanan, from which it appears that the degrees of protection, both actual and relative, afforded by vaccination, is greatest to people under 5 years of age; less when ages from birth to 20 years are examined; and still less when people of all ages are taken into account. 12 Londoners can, says Dr. Buchanan, "by availing themselves of one average vaccination, diminish the chances of their children dying of small-pox in the proportion of 146 to 1, for the first five years of their life; and the same vaccination serves to lessen, in the proportion of 74 to 1, the chance of their being killed by the disease before they reach the age of 20. After that age, the vaccination in infancy is further reduced in its protective influence, for the difference in small-pox mortality between the unvaccinated and the vaccinated class, through the whole period of life, is as 1 to 37, a protection incomplete indeed, but obviously important for everybody to possess." For further information on this subject, I may refer you to my Quarterly Reports ended April 2nd, 1859, pages 4 to 8; December 1870, pages 10 to 21; December 1876, pages 7 to 13. In page XXI. of the Forty-second Annual Report of the Registrar-General, for the year 1879, and published in the year 1881, is the following Table, showing the deaths from small-pox, 1877—78—79, among the vaccinated, unvaccinated, and those in whom no statement as to vaccination has been made. Deaths from Small Pox, 1877—78—79. localities. Vaccinated. Unvaccinated. No Statement as to Vaccination. London 1,097 2,073 1,248 Best of England and Wales 396 634 1,222 All England and Wales 1,493 2,707 2.470 The Registrar-General remarks that, "there can be no doubt that the main cause of the outbreaks of small-pox is neglect of vaccination; and from information supplied by various registrars, there is reason to believe that it is no uncommon thing for a parent, in order to avoid the vaccination acts, not to register the birth of a child at all, or to give the registrar a false address. What numbers of the children, or persons generally, who die of small-pox, owe their deaths to such violation of the law, it is impossible to say with 13 ness; for, in the three years, 1877—9, in a very large proportion of fatal cases, 28.2 per cent. in London, and 54.3 per cent. in the rest of all England and Wales, the medical attendant was unable, or neglected to state, in the certificate, whether the deceased was vaccinated or not. But, confining ourselves to those cases in which the necessary information is given, it appears that 64.5 per cent. of the persons who died of small-pox in England and Wales, in these three years, were unvaccinated, and only 35.5 per cent. were vaccinated. In London, 65.4 per cent. of the fatal cases, concerning which the necessary information was forthcoming, were unvaccinated, while, in the rest of England and Wales, the per centage was 61.6. "This, however, does not necessarily imply that a larger proportion of persons were unvaccinated in London than elsewhere; the difference might possibly be due to better and more efficacious vaccination in London, owing to which a smaller proportion out of the vaccinated was liable to infection." In the Annual Summary of Births, Deaths, and Causes of Death, for the year 1880, it appears that London, at the time when the census of 1871 was taken, contained a population of 3,254,260, and there died of small-pox 475; of which 104, or 21.9 per cent. had been vaccinated; 229, or 48.2 per cent. had not been vaccinated, and in the remainder 142, or 29.8 per cent., there was no statement as to vaccination. In order to improve this state of things it might be desirable to have a Public Register kept of every certified case of successful vaccination, to which should be added the number of cicatrices in each case. The Register should also contain the name and address of the vaccinator, and the] name of the patient vaccinated, so that when a case of small-pox occurred in every public hospital, reference might be made to this Register for information relating to the name and address of the vaccinator. I recommended at page 8 of my Quarterly Report for June, 1877, that vaccination should be performed only by the Public Vaccinator, and I gave my reasons for such recommendation. 14 Importance of the Early Notification of Epidemic Diseases to the Sanitary Authority. The neglect in not giving early intimation of a case of small-pox is strikingly exemplified by the following disastrous consequences which occurred in a street in Mile End New Town. On the 10th of August last, a child aged six years, died of smallpox, at No. 6, Dunk Street, when notice of the death was sent to the Sanitary Officer by the Local Registrar of the District. Inquiry into the particulars of this death was immediately instituted by the Sanitary Inspector, who learnt that the patient had been attended by a medical practitioner, but who did not send a notification of the case either to the Inspector or the Medical Officer of Health. Shortly after the visit of the Sanitary Inspector the body was removed by the Relieving Officer to the dead house in the stone yard, where it remained until it was buried. On revisiting the same house on the 18th of August, the Inspector ascertained that another child of the same family was suffering from small-pox. This case was also attended as a private patient by a medical practitioner, who did not intimate the existence of the disease to the Sanitary Officer. On the same day the Inspector ascertained that two other children, living in the same house, were suffering from smallpox, and, on revisiting the house on the following day, two more children were found by the Inspector to have been attacked with the same disease. The Inspector having reason to believe that there were other cases of small-pox in the same street, visited the whole of the houses therein, 42 in number, and ascertained that 7 other cases of small-pox existed in that street, thus making a total of 12 cases, all of which were removed to the hospital. Some difficulty was experienced in inducing the parents to have their children removed to the hospital. So soon as all the children were removed from the several houses in which cases of small-pox had existed, the rooms, clothes, and bedding, which had been used by the patients, were disinfected. I have no hesitation in saying that had intimation been given to the Sanitary Officer of the existence of the first case of small-pox, this sad calamity would have been prevented. 15 Trade Nuisances. Complaints having been made of a nuisance caused by the drying of fish skins upon the first floor of No. 12, Duke Street, Old Artillery Ground, the Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Wrack, visited the premises, and informed the occupier that the locality was not suitable for the carrying on of such an offensive business, and requested him, without delay, to discontinue the use of the premises for any offensive business purposes. Mr. Wrack subsequently reported that the nuisance had been removed from the District. An application was made to the Metropolitan Board of Works by a Mr. Stanton, for sanction to establish anew the business of a tripe boiler, at the rear of No. 29, Thomas Street, Whitechapel. The matter was referred to your Board by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the same being objected to, Mr. Stanton withdrew his application. Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act. Mr. Battram reports that he has submitted to Mr. Young, the Analyst for the District, five samples of milk, three of coffee, and one of arrow-root, for analysis; one sample of milk was found to be adulterated with 25 per cent. of water. A summons was taken out against the vendor, a conviction obtained, and a fine of £1 and 2s* costs imposed. Mr. Wrack reports that, during the Quarter ended 1st October, he purchased 11 samples of milk, and two of bread, and submitted the same to the Public Analyst for analysis; four of the milks were reported to be adulterated with water in the following proportions, viz., 11, 13, 14 and 22 percent. The vendors were cautioned; several samples of milk had been previously purchased of the same persons, which were reported to be pure. The breads were reported to be free from adulteration. 16 Sanitary Works Performed during the Quarter ended 1st October, 1881.

REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, for the QUARTER ENDED 31st DECEMBER, 1881. BY JOHN LIDDLE, medical officer of health. London: Printed by- Penny & Hull, 63, Leman St., Whitechapel, E. 1882 REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Quarter ended 31st December, 1881. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. Gentlemen, In the Quarter that ended on Saturday, the 31st December, 1881, the total births in the District, were 612, viz, 310 males and 302 females; and the deaths 578, viz., 329 males and 249 females. The excess of births over deaths has therefore been, during the Quarter, 34. As the deaths of 117 non-residents, which occurred in the London Hospital, are included in the mortality returns, a deduction of such deaths must be made in order to estimate the correct mortality of the District, thereby reducing the total mortality to 461, and thus increasing the number of births above deaths to 151. An allowance, however, must be made for the deaths of residents in public institutions outside the District; but of those I have no return. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the total births were 621, and the total deaths 502. The weekly average of births was 47.7, and of deaths 38.6; and in the present Quarter the weekly average of births has been 47.0, and of deaths 44.4. In the Spitalfields sub-District the births were 171, and the deaths 105; in the Mile End New Town 172, and the deaths 166 (in this sub-District the Workhouse is situated); in the Whitechapel North 79, and the deaths 48; in the Whitechapel Church 59, and the deaths 194 (in this sub-District the London Hospital is situated); in the Goodman's Fields 92, and the deaths 37; and in the Aldgate 39, and the deaths 28. The deaths have exceeded the births in the Whitechapel Church sub-District by 135, but the deaths of the 117 non-residents in the London Hospital must be deducted. The proportion of births to deaths is therefore 59 to 77. The deaths in the London Hospital have been 166; of these, 117 were of non-residents in the District, 16 of residents, and 33 of persons who either died suddenly or from the result of accident. The deaths of persons who resided in this District, previous to their 4 admission into the London Hospital, form but a very small proportion of the total deaths in that Institution. Excluding the deaths caused by accident (the previous residences of persons so dying not always being given in the weekly returns), the proportion of deaths of residents in this Quarter is 10.2 per cent. In the last Quarter, ended 1st October, the proportion of deaths of residents to non-residents was 14.3 per cent. The deaths in the Workhouse Infirmary, Baker's Row, have been 80. In the corresponding Quarter of last year they were 75. The deaths from epidemic diseases in the entire District have been 61; viz., 3 from small-pox, to which must be added the 3 deaths which occurred in the Small-pox Hospitals, thus making 6 deaths from small-pox, 7 from measles, 8 from scarlet-fever, 5 from diphtheria, 23 from hooping-cough, 4 from diarrhoea, and 11 from fever. Five deaths from fever occurred in the Fever Hospital of patients removed from this District, thus making 16 deaths from fever and increasing the deaths from epidemic diseases to 69. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the deaths from epidemic diseases were 3.5, viz, 5 from small-pox (including 4 deaths which occurred in the Small-pox Hospital), 11 from measles, 6 from scarlet-fever, 5 from diphtheria, 1 from hooping-cough, 6 from diarrhoea, and 8 from fever, including 3 deaths which occurred in the Fever Hospital. Mortality of Young Children. The mortality of children under 1 year of age is 126. This is 21.8 per cent. of the total mortality. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year it was 15.7 per cent. In the Spitalfields sub-District the rate is 34.2 per cent.; in the Mile End New Town 22,8 per cent.; in the Whitechapel North 29.1 per cent.; in the Whitechapel Church 7.7 per cent.; in the Goodman's Fields 27.0 per cent.; and in the Aldgate 46.4 per cent. The difference of the rate of mortality of young children in the Mile End New Town and Whitechapel Church sub-Districts is thus explained;—In the former the Workhouse is situated, and in the latter the London Hospital; in both these Institutions the children under 1 year bear only a small proportion to the adults. The total deaths under 5 years, during the Quarter, are 217, which shows a rate of mortality of 35.8 per cent. in relation to the total deaths, including those of non-residents, and 35.4 per cent. to 5 the total births. The rate of mortality under one year, in relation to the total births, is 20.5 per cent. Pauper Illness in the District. The Medical Officers of the Union have attended, during the past Quarter 1009 new cases of illness out of the Workhouse; including 7 of small-pox, 8 of measles, 8 of scarlatina, 16 of hooping-cough, 15 of diarrhoea, 12 of fever, 28 of febricula, and 8 of erysipelas. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the number of pauper cases of illness was 904; including 16 of small-pox, 16 of measles, 8 of scarlatina, 19 of diarrhoea, 36 of febricula, 6 of fever, and 10 of erysipelas. The total number of cases of illness in the Workhouse has been 954; including 2 of small-pox, 1 of measles, 1 of hoopingcough, 14 of diarrhœa, 29 of fever, 9 of erysipelas, and 15 of febricula. In addition to the above cases, there were 25 of syphilis and gonorrhoea; thus making a total of 979. Uncertified Deaths. Six uncertified deaths are recorded during the Quarter; 3 in the Spitalfields sub-District, 1 in the Whitechapel North sub-District, 1 in the Goodman's Fields sub-District, and 1 in the Aldgate subDistrict. Meteorology of Greenwich. The Returns of the Registrar-General show that the rain-fall in the Metropolis during the Quarter, has been 7.52 inches. One inch deep of rain-fall on an acre weighs (allowing 10-lbs. to a gallon, which is the weight of a gallon of distilled water) nearly 101 tons. During the corresponding Quarter of last year the rain-fall was 12.54 inches. The average annual rain-fall at Greenwich in 63 years, was 25.4 inches. The mean temperature of the air was 44°.5. In the corresponding Quarter of last year it was 43°7. The weather during this Quarter has been unusually mild. On only twelve days has the thermometer registered the temperature of the atmosphere as below 32°. The coldest days during the Quarter were Saturday, the 24th December, Friday, the 23rd December, and Monday, the 17th October, when the thermometer indicated respectively 21°6, 26°0, and 26°0. The coldest day during the corresponding Quarter of the previous year was on the 2nd November, when the thermometer indicated 25°0. The lowest mean temperature during any week in the Quarter was that which ended Saturday, 24th December, when the thermometer indicated 31°7. In the corresponding Quarter of last year the lowest mean temperature in any week was in that which ended November 4th, when it was 31°2. 6 The results of all the meteorological observations are to be understood as applying to the civil day, or from midnight to midnight. The deaths from diphtheria in London during the Quarter were 243; only 5 of which are recorded as having occurred in the "Whitechapel District.

On the 30th November last, I submitted a Report to the Committee of Works on the desirability of making certain additions to the means now in use for disinfecting bedding, &c. In the first place it was suggested in my Report that there should be erected, in addition to the disinfecting chamber, but forming no part of the same, a building which should be provided with proper means for the destruction by fire, without causing a nuisance, of such articles of bedding, clothing, &c., as had become infected, but which were so old and worn out as to render them perfectly useless. I am pleased to add that this new building and appliances were suggested and carried out by Mr. Struthers, a member of your Board, a gentleman who has devoted much time and given great attention in the perfecting of the furnaces used in the disinfecting of the several articles which are submitted to the heat required, for the purpose of effectually destroying the contagious matter contained in them, without injuring their texture. Secondly, it was recommended that there should be provided for the use of the men engaged in the work of disinfecting, means for washing their faces and hands. Thirdly, that stout bags, made of tick, should be purchased for enclosing the infected articles while they were being removed from the house where infectious disease had recently existed, so that such articles might be more safely conveyed to the disinfecting chamber. Fourthly. that gloves should be provided for the use of the men while engaged in the work of disinfecting; these gloves should be disinfected after each time they are used. Fifthly, that light overcoats or capes should be provided for the use of the Inspectors while superintending the process of disinfection, and some kind of dress should also be provided for the use of the men while engaged in the same work. All the above suggestions have been adopted and with satisfactory results. Overcrowding of a School Room- Mr. Inspector Wrack, in the course of his visitation of houses in Pelham Street, Spitalfields, found a serious case of overcrowding at 10 No. 11 in that street. The room was used by a foreigner lor a school, in which young children were taught the Hebrew language. In this room which was nine feet long, eight feet wide, and eight feet high, there were twenty-five children, whose ages varied from four to seven years, and also the master and his wife; in all twenty-seven persons; thus giving only an average of 21.3 cubic feet of space for each occupant of the room. Mr. Wrack learnt that occasionally there was a much larger number of children present at one time in this room. The Inspector further adds, that independently of the small size of the room, it was totally unfit for a school, in consequence of its confined situation. The atmosphere of the room was described as being most oppressive, and the children looked pale and sickly. The overcrowding of school rooms for young children, I am sorry to say, is of very frequent occurrence, and would not be discovered unless by a house to house visitation. Whenever cases of school rooms are found to be overcrowded, legal proceedings are always taken for the abatement of the nuisance. Retention of Dead Bodies in Rooms occupied by Families as Living and Sleeping Rooms. Mr. Inspector Battram reports that he discovered in two different rooms, which were occupied by families, two dead bodies; one was that of a young woman, at 58, Gower's Walk, which, at the time of the Inspector's visit, had been kept uncoffined for four days in the room where the father and two young children lived and slept. Information of this nuisance was given at the Sanitary Office, when Mr. Battram, immediately on seeing the case, directed the attention of the Relieving Officer to the same, and the body was removed. The other case was that of a man who died suddenly at No. 12, Everard's Place. In this case an inquest had to be held, and it was some time before the wife and relatives allowed the body to be removed for the purpose of holding the inquest. After the inquest the body was brought back to the same room in the house in which the man died, and was kept there for seven days. In this room three persons lived and slept. Surely it is full time that a proper mortuary was built for the use of this District, in which a dead body might be kept under the control of officials until the day of the funeral. 11 BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, A list of Streets and Places in which are recorded the number of Small-pox Cases that occurred therein during the years 1871, 1872, 1877, 1878, 1879, 1880, and 1881, which came under the notice of the Sanitary Officers.

Special Reports of the outbreaks were prepared by the Medical Officer of Health, and printed in the Reports for the Quarters ending June, 1877, and March, 1878. 16 Sanitaby Wobks Pebformed during the Quabteb ended 31st December, 1881. The following return shows the amount of work done by tho Sanitary Inspectors during the Quarter ended 31st December, 1881.

ANNUAL REPORT. The number of births registered in this District during the year has been 256G, and the deaths 2351, including those of non-residents in the London Hospital (446). In the preceding year the births were 2733 and the deaths 2302, including the deaths of 439 non-residents. The deaths in the Workhouse have been 329, against 350 for the previous year; and the deaths in the London Hospital 654 against 631. The population of the District, at the taking of the last census, according to the unrevised enumerated table, and published weekly in the Returns of the Registrar-General, was 71,350; but in a recently corrected return, the population is 71,301. 17 The inhabited houses are 7,594. In 1871 the population was 76,520, and the inhabited houses 8,264. The deaths (excluding 446 of non-residents) being 1905, the rate of mortality has been, during the year, 26.6 per 1000. The rate of mortality during the preceding year was 24.3 per 1000. In making a comparison, however, of the rate of mortality of this District with that of others in which there is no hospital, the total deaths in the London Hospital must be eliminated, which, this year, as before stated, amount to 654. This gives a mortality of 23.7 per 1000. The annual rate of mortality since the year 1866, which was the year when cholera was epidemic, may be seen on referring to Table No. 5 in the Appendix. Deaths from Epidemic Diseases. Of the total deaths recorded in this District during the year, there were 307 from epidemic diseases, viz., 14 from small-pox, to which must be added the 33 which occurred in the Small-pox Hospital, thus making a total of 47; 88 from measles, 26 from scarlet-fever, 9 from diphtheria, 48 from hooping-cough, 91 from diarrhoea, and 31 from fever, to which must be added the 5 deaths which occurred in the Fever Hospital, thus making a total of 36. The deaths from fever, including those which occurred in the Fever Hospital, have been 36. In the whole of London, the deaths from fever have been 1195. The death-rate from epidemic diseases, including those in hospitals, for the year, in relation to the total mortality, is 14.5 per cent. Small-pox in London. In the fifty-two weeks ended December 31st, the deaths in London from small-pox were 2371, which is equal to 621 per million of the population. Pauper Illness in the District. The number of out-door sick paupers who have been attended by the Medical Officers of the Union is 4229. Duiing the previous year the number was 3660. The extraordinary annual diminution in the number of the out-door sick paupers, from upwards of 17,000, in the years 1867 and 1868, to 2060 in 1877, is a matter of great satisfaction to the ratepayers of this District. 18 Sanitary Works performed during the Year 1881.

All the cow-houses and the slaughter-houses have been visited four times during the year. In addition to this return, the Inspectors report that they have forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works several notices of dangerous structures, which notices the Metropolitan Board have promptly attended to. It gives me much pleasure in bearing testimony to the zeal and energy displayed by the Sanitary Inspectors, Messrs. Battram and Wrack, in the faithful performance of their duties. The work that the Inspectors perform is certainly onerous, and is not altogether unattended with danger. They feel, however, an interest in their work, and they are enabled to see not only a favorable result from their labours, in the fact of a diminished rate of mortality in the District, but that their services are acknowledged by the Board, and appreciated by the Medical Officer of Health. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOIIN LIDDLE. 15, Great Alie Street. APPENDIX.
