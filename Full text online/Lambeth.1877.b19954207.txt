Pursuant to the 198th Section of the "Metropolis Management Act," the Vestry Present the Twenty-Second Report of their proceedings, under the Acts before mentioned, and of Works completed and improvements effected, during the year ending the 25th day of March, 1878. During the past year, new Paving Works of great extent have been executed, Improvements effected, and Public Lighting increased, in relating to which the Vestry have been actuated by the desire of extending the benefits thereof as widely as possible, endeavouring to avoid any serious increase of local taxation. The Works and Improvements referred to are hereafter specifically described under the respective heads of Sewerage, and Street and House Drainage, &c., at page 4; Highways, New Works, and Improvements at page 5; Lighting matters at page 6; and Sanitary matters at page 9. The Report also contains an Account in Abstract, showing the Receipts and Expenditure of tho Vestry for the year ending at Lady-day last; also a Summary Statement of all Contracts entered into, and of monies owing to, and debts and liabilities owing by tho Vestry. These accounts have been duly audited by the Auditors, elected by the Parishioners. For the purpose of efficient publication, an Abstract Account, of amounts received and paid by the Lambeth Burial Board, from the 1st day of April, 1877, to the 31st day of March, 1878, is set forth at pages 40 and 47. The accounts of the said Board have been duly audited. b 2 4 THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF LAMBETH.

In the past year 80 Applications have been received for improved Lighting in various parts of the Parish, 71 of which were complied with, and 9 refused. There have been 105 new Lamps erected, and 10 removed to positions which increased their utility. The total number of public Lamps lighted by the Vestry at the present time is 3,346, and the cost of Lighting, including new Columns, the removal of Lamps, and other expenses, amounts to £14,306 10s. 1d. The periodical Reports, made by the Medical Officer relativo to the quality and illuminating power of the Gas supplied by tho London, Phoenix, and Crystal Palaco District Companies, show that tho illuminating power has always been above tho Parliamentary standard, and free from Sulphuretted Hydrogen and Ammonia.

Gentlemen, On submitting to you the twenty-second Annual report on the sanitary condition of the parish of Lambeth, it will be observed that the rate of mortality was considerably lower than in past years—a result mainly due to the fact that the seasonal changes during the year, as affected by moisture, temperature, etc., although conducing to the spread of small pox, have been favourable to the Public Health generally. I trust that the information contained in the report will suffice to impress you with the importance of the work the several officers of the Sanitary Staff arc engaged in, and to assure you that they have continued to perform their duties in an efficient and praiseworthy manner. I remain, Your obedient Servant, ARCHER FARR, Medical Officer of Health. To the Chairman and Gentlemen of the Vestry of the Parish of Lambeth. 9 INTRODUCTION. The population of Lambeth in 1861 was 162,044, and in 1871, 208,342, thus giving the district an increase of 46,208 persons at the end of ten years. The average number of persons per house in 1861 and 1871, respectively, was 71 and 7 2, while the average number of persons per house for the whole Metropolis was exactly the same in both census periods, viz., 7.8. Thus, it would appear that one of the surest methods of estimating the population of a large Metropolitan District like Lambeth at any inter-census period, is to find the number of rated houses, and to apportion the same number of persons to each house as shown in the previous census. On the assumption that the annual rate of increase has been the same as in the previous decade, I have estimated the population of Lambeth to the 30th September, 1877, at 251,517, or if 7 persons for each of the 35,965 rated houses bo allowed, it will give a population of 251,755, being 238 more than the number arrived at by the usual method of calculation. While, therefore, 251,517 must closely approximate a correct estimate, I believe that it under-rates the population rather than exceeds it; in which case, the health of the Parish, as shown by the accompanying Report, would also be slightly under estimated. Many houses have disappeared to make room for improvements, but building is being earned on very actively in different parts of the Parish, and the number of fresh immigrants every year is very considerable. Reference to the following Table, compiled from the Census 10 Returns of 1871, will give an idea of the extent to which house accommodation is annually on the increase. HOUSES.

In the Waterloo 1st district, however, concurrently with this destruction of property, some blocks of Peabody's Buildings have been erected, containing 351 families, or a total population of 1441. In East Street, Kennington Road, on a site where stood some houses which had been pronounced by me as being unfit for habitation, Mr. Sansom has erected a block of Model Dwellings for the Artizan Class, known as Claydon Buildings. It is four stories high, and contains 35 separate suites of four rooms each, and is intended to accommodate 35 families or about 200 persons. The design is an excellent one, and many more after the same model would be a great boon to the poorer classes. There is one most important sanitary arrangement such blocks of houses admit of, which cannot be applied to small house property, and 11 that is separate water supply for flushing closets and drinking purposes. BIRTH AND DEATH RATE. In the year ending 31st March, 1878, there were 8783 births, and 5541) deaths registered in Lambeth. The births were 183 less, and the deaths 220 more than in the previous year. The births showed an increase in each quarter of the year, viz., June, 2094; September, 2149; December, 2221; and March quarter, 2319. The deaths recorded in the June quarter were 1 1418; in September, 1110; in December, 1386; and in March quarter, 1029. After deducting strangers, the deaths referred to the seven principal Zymotic Diseases were 61 less than in the previous year. Assuming the population at the middle of the year to have been 251,517, the birth-rate for the whole of Lambeth District was 349 per 1000, and the death-rate, deducting strangers, 19.6. If the deaths of 615 strangers brought to the hospitals from various parts of the Metropolis and Provinces were included, the death-rate would be 221. 1284 deaths of children under one year of age, occurred, viz., 93 in Waterloo Read 1st, 111 in Waterloo 2nd, 131 in Lambeth Church 1st, 289 in Lambeth Church 2nd, 229 in Kennington 1st, 114 in Kinnington 2nd, 253 in Brixton, and 64 in the Norwood Sub Districts. The proportion per cent, of deaths under one year to total deaths was 23.1; that of London was 24.1. The number of deaths under one year to 1000 births was 146; that of London, 150. There died also 976 children above 1 and under 5 years, and 1094 persons aged 60 and upwards; the proportion per cent, to deaths from all causes of the former being 17 6 per cent, and of the latter 19.7. In London (inner-ring) the births recorded during the four quarters ending March, 1878, gave a birth-rate of 36.1, and the deaths a death-rate of 22 4 per 1000 of population. Thus, the health of the Parish of Lambeth continues to compare favorably with that of the rest of the Metropolis. 12 The excess of births over deaths shows the natural increase of population, or gain of life for the year. The births, having been 8783, and the deaths 5540, the natural increase has been 3234 (1055 males and 1570 females).

Deducting these, the death-rate for the former was 26.2, and for the latter 15.8 per 1000. 325 strangers were referred to the principal Zymotic Diseases, which, if deducted, reduces the Zymotic rate for the Urban portion to 37, and that for the Sub-Urban to 2.9 per 1000. The Zymotic rate for London for the same period was 3.8. DEATHS FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES. 1131 deaths were referred to the principal Zymotic Diseases, including 325 strangers. In the June quarter, 302 deaths, 13 (103 strangers), were registered; 231, (66 strangers), in the September quarter; 242, (74 strangers), in the December quarter; and 356, (82 strangers), in the March quarter. 329 died from Small Pox (191 stranger 1G3 „ Measles 1 „ 132 „ Scarlet Fever 45 „ 39 „ Diphtheria 3 „ 200 „ Whooping Cough 0 „ 41 ,, Typhus Fever 35 „ 96 „ Enteric 49 „ 21 „ Simple Continued 0 „ 110 ,, Diarrhœa 1 „ 1131 325 The mortality from Small Pox was highest in the June quarter of the year 1877; in the September quarter it decreased considerably; it rose again, however, in the December quarter, and showed a still further increase for the quarter ending March. The greatest increase was in the first half of the latter quarter, the disease, as shown by the number of cases reported, declining rapidly towards the end. In Table II. will be found the number of deaths from Small Pox in each Sub-District. In the Brixton Sub-District, of tho 290 deaths recorded, 190 were strangers. Tho deaths from Measles in tho four quarters of the year were respectively 68, 25, 31 and 39. An unusual fatality from Measles occurred in tho month of January in Reedworth Street, Kennington Road. The house in which it took place was one of a row of new six-roomed houses with basements. It was occupied by two families—one with six children, and tho other with ono only. Tho rooms in the basement and the two upper bed-rooms wero occupied by the former, and the parlours on the ground floor by the latter. All tho children belonging to both families sickened on about the same day, and five—aged respectively 9, 6, 4, and 2 years, and an infant a few months old—died within a week. Through the 14 courtesy of Dr. Marsh, the family medical attendant, I had an opportunity of seeing some of the children while living, and tho character of the rash in each case, the accompanying bronchopneumonia, and the typhoid condition of tho patient, showed it to be suppressed measles of a most malignant type. On proceeding to examine the sanitary state of the premises, it was soon evident from tho tainted and close atmosphere that no regard was paid to ventilation, and a want of cleanliness was very apparent in every department, the parlour occupied by tho lodger excepted. A thorough exploration of tho house pipes failed to discover any defect within tho building, but the pan-trap of the w.c. was out of repair, and a great force of sewer air escaped therefrom, tho odour from which was most offensive. An analysis of the water showed it to be largely contaminated with sewer gas, through the waste-pipo of the cistern discharging itself into tho soil-pipe of the closet. It is remarkable that the one child living in the parlours, tho cleanest and the best ventilated part of the house, was the only one in which the rash of measles could bo fully developed, and although he ultimately succumbed from Pneumonia, he struggled on the longest, the disease in him never manifesting tho same degree of malignancy. It was supposed that the children took tho infection at a Public School, but inquiry proved that there had been no ease of measles among any of the attendants for months previously. I regard the above as ono of those cases in which the simple infection of a disease may bo rendered malignant on entering the body, the vitality of which has been previously lowered, and the blood rendered impure, by contaminated air and water. The mortality from Scarlet Fever increased throughout tho first, second, and third quarters of the 3 ear, and declined in the fourth or March quarter. The deaths in each quarter were as follows:—June, 28, (8 stiangers); September, 39, (22 strangers); December, 43, (7 strangers); and March, 22, (8 strangers). Diphtheria caused 9 deaths in tho June quarter, 7 in September 15 quarter, 15 in December and 8 in March quarters. Of the 30 deaths due to this malady, 18 occurred at houses in the Brixton Sub-District, and 3 strangers died at St. Thomas's Hospital. Whooping Cough caused 21 deaths in the June quarter, 18 in the September quarter, 28 in December, and 133 in the March quarter. Typhus Fever caused 41 deaths within the District, but of this number 6 only belonged to Lambeth, the remainder dying in Stock well Fever Hospital. The six Lambeth cases included two nurses employed in the Stockwell Fever Hospital, a female patient whoso address was unknown, a labourer who died at St. Thomas's Hospital, and whose residence was at 24, Lambeth Walk, a female, aged 19, the daughter of a printer, at 7, High Street, and a woman, aged 62, the wife of a sawyer, residing at 26, Ridgway Road, Brixton. Typhoid Fever showed an increase (as compared with the mortality of the previous year) in the Waterloo 1st; Lambeth Church 1st and 2nd; Kennington 2nd; and Norwood; but in the other Sub-Districts there was a marked decline. The 12 deaths in Lambeth Church 1st include 7 strangers who died in St. Thomas's Hospital, and the 57 deaths in Brixton 42 strangers who died in the Stockwell Fever Hospital. During the months of October, November, December, and January, the season at which Enteric Fever is most prevalent, the number of cases was in excess of last year, being 55 as against 32. They were isolated cases, and were distributed through the poorest and most densely populated districts of the Parish. Every effort was made to trace each case to its origin, and in the majority of instances it was found associated with defective drainage, contaminated water supply, or both. Early in the autumn, I received a communication from tho Medical Officer of Health for ono of tho Western Metropolitan Districts, directing my attention to a Dairy in Lambeth through which it was suspected Enteric Fever had been disseminated. On visiting the establishment, however, I found it ono of the 16 best appointed in the District, and the sanitary arrangements such as to preclude the possibility of the milk becoming contaminated on the premises by any of the means through which the infection of Enteric Fever is conveyed. As so much has been revealed of late years respecting the insanitary condition of Dairy Farms causing the spread of Enteric Fever through the medium of milk, it behoves every Medical Officer of Health to be on the alert for snch cause whenever Enteric Fever may appear in his District; but while exercising every vigilanco against the invasion of the disease from that source, a wise discretion should be observed, lest he may too hastily condemn the milk supply, to tho serious injury of the trader. It may be accepted as a rule, that where Enteric Fever is caused by infected milk, it occurs in groups of cases in different families, and within a limited area; but where, in the winter season of the year, when it is generally rife in a district, the cases are isolated and widely scattered, Drain Fever is indicated. In the course of my enquiries it was found that several of the affected persons never took any other than condensed milk, and although I have no reason to suspect that in any of the cases the poison of Enteric Fever might have been conveyed through this channel, it occurred to me that since there are so many preparations in the market, such a contingency is possible, and that in event of this happening, the temperature to which the milk is subjected during its manufacture would not suffice to destroy the contagium. Of Simple Continued Fever, 21 persons died during the year. The deaths from Diarrhoea were 85 less than in the previous year, the greatest mortality occurring in the September quarter. During the year, 803 cases of attacks of Zymotic Diseases were reported to tho Vestry, comprising 509 Small Pox, 15 Measles, 131 Scarlet Fever, 12 Diphtheria, and 70 different forms of Fever. In every instance the premises wore inspected, and all neces- 17 sary steps taken in isolating the patients where practicable, and in carrying out thorough disinfection. The following table gives the number of cases of epidemic disease attended by the Poor Law Medical Officers in each quarter of the year:— TABLE I. Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever Whooping Cgh.

Two deaths from accidental Asphyxia occurred, and the remaining 21 deaths were from general causes, calling for no special remark. The death-rate per 1000 living in tho building was 19.4, while the deaths duo to Zymotic disease gave a rate of 3.5 per 1000. SMALL POX. The total number of cases of Small Pox reported to the Vestry during tho year was 569, of which number 412 were pauper cases. They wero distributed throughout the Parish as follows : 1876-7. 1877-8. 138 North and South Marsh Wards 100 136 Bishop's and Prince's „ 130 480 Stock well and Vauxhall „ 242 222 Brixton and Norwood „ 97 976 Totals. 569 18 The following is a List of the Streets immediately surrounding, and within a radius of a quarter of a mile, of Stockwell Small Pox Hospital.

The very large proportion of imperfectly vaccinated and unvaccinated cases in the death returns from Small Pox suggest the urgent necessity for early legislation as regards compulsory re-vaccination. The preventive efficacy of re-vaccination is placed beyond all doubt, and the various channels through which the infection of Small Pox is convoyed are so numerous, that a Sanitary Authority is almost powerless in checking the spread of the disease in the absence of a compulsory law securing during an epidemic tho re-vaccination of all those insufficiently protected by primary vaccination. Foremost among the causes rendering the prevention of the spread of infection so difficult are ignorance and carelessness on the part of parents and others, and the wilful concealment of the existence of disease. In the better classes of Society it is the exception to find a second case of Small Pox occurring in a family; and this is not altogether because any superior method of disinfection is adopted, or that the home may offer greater advantages as regards the isolation of the patient, but is due to the fact that the upper classes more readily avail themselves of re-vaccination, and the family medical attendant, knowing he will have a fee for each case, promptly re-vaccinates all those in the household who may require it. But with the poorer classes—and I refer especially to those cases in which houses are lot in apartments—the obstacles in the way of the sanitary authority are very great. Prevailing amongst the uneducated is a popular belief that it one does not fear any particular contagion, he will never take it, and those of this belief are in the habit of visiting such cases with impunity, to the imminent risk of the lives of those with whom they are in frequent communication. Another equally absurd idea with them is that attending a mild attack of any infectious disease, there is little or no danger c 2 20 of its being communicated, and in such a case medical advice is probably not sought for until several members of the family are found falling in succession. This is one of the strongest arguments possible in the legislating for a system of registration of disease, for making it compulsory on the part of the householder or head of a family to give notico of the existenco of any infectious disease. Another fruitful source of the spread of Small Pox, &c., is where two or more families reside in one house. Where it happens in one family, it is frequently kept secret from tho other, the chief cause of the suppression of the information being the dreaded loss of business or occupation. And here I would remark, that during the recent epidemic, I have witnessed some painful cases of families becoming impoverished by loss of trade or occupation; but in every case this result would have been averted if the aid of this department had been called in at tho onset of the disease. The observance of tho foregoing facts has led me to consider what would constitute the most practicable and most efficient system of compulsory re-vaccination. As to a system compelling every one to be re-vaccinated at different ages, I can conceive many objections; but instead of so general an application, I would suggest that it be made compulsory throughout any family or families residing in a house in which a case of Small Pox has occurred, and that any medical man, whether an appointed Public Vaccinator or not, should be paid by the State for performing the operation. One of the greatest objections to the present regime is that Public Vaccinators only are paid for vaccinating, the result of which is to create an antagonism between him and the private practitioner. A further hindrance to successful vaccination is, that Public Vaccinators are not encouraged by additional payment to vaccinate persons at their homes. THE WATER SUPPLY. Of the waters supplied from the Thames, that delivered by 21 the West Middlesex was the best, and that distributed by the Southwark Company the worst. The water supplied by the Southwark Company was, on examination, clear on 7 occasions, turbid on 4, and very turbid on 1. The Lambeth Water Company's was clear on 8 occasions, and slightly turbid on 4. Moving organisms were found in the Southwark Company's water on 5 occasions, and in the Lambeth on 1 only. Both waters show considerable improvement as compared with previous years, which is attributed to the more careful treatment of the water, as regards subsidence and filtration, by the respective Companies. METEOROLOGY.* The mean temperature of the year 1877 at Greenwich was 49°4, which is 0°8 above the averago of 106 years; it was 3°1 above the average in June, but the temperature of the summer was below the average, and on no day was it higher in the shade than 88°2. The mean temperature of the three winter months was 3°6 above the average of 106 years. There was a downfall of 26.9 inches of rain in 183 out of the 365 days. The average rainfall at Greenwich was 25 3 inches, so that this amount was 1G inches above the average. The fall in January was excessive; no less than 4.35 inches fell in 23 days, and produced extensive inundation. The wind swept the earth at the mean velocity of 13 miles, which is abont 2.3 miles above the average. Year of 62 Weeks. Mean.

Following up the suggestion made in my last Annual Report, recommending that the excreta passing from Small Pox and Fever patients in Hospitals should be thoroughly disinfected before being allowed to mingle with the sewage of the district, Dr. Soper, member of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, has invented and applied to the drains of the Stockwell Fever and Small Pox Hospitals an apparatus by which any infection contained in the sewage can be conveniently and effectually destroyed on its way to the main sewer. The invention consists in the application of chlorine gas by means of a generator of Dr. Sopor's own design, which is in the shape of a cone, and perforated at its apex. Connecting the sewer with the surface of the ground is an eighteen-inch sewer pipe, placed perpendicularly into which, the generator, previously charged, is lowered by means of a chain. It is so adjusted that when in situ, its perforated end dips some inches into the sewer, and emits a continuous stream of chlorine gas, the charge being so regulated as to require renewing twice a week only. During the recent epidemic, the defective drainage in many of the houses in which Small Pox occurred within the Stockwell district, pointed strongly to the possibility of the infection having been conveyed through the medium of sewer gas, and I shall watch with the greatest interest, the result of this novel and important sanitary application, as affecting the health of that immediate locality.
