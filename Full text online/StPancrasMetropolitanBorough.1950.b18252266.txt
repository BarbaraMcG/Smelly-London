To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for the year 1950. This is the seventh report it has been my privilege to submit to you. 1950 was a year of celebration for the Metropolitan Boroughs, for it represented the fiftieth anniversary of their establishment. Prior to that St. Pancras existed not as a Metropolitan Borough but as a Vestry. It was the London Government Act of 1899 which established St. Pancras as a Metropolitan Borough and defined its boundaries. My predecessor in those days was John M. Sykes, M.D., D.Sc., to whom is largely due the establishment of the child welfare movement in this country. It was his inspiration, together with that of a band of volunteers, that started the School for Mothers in St. Pancras. He records in his annual report for the year 1900 that St. Pancras came into existence as a Metropolitan Borough in November of that year. It may be well, then, to cast back our minds to the beginning of the century and compare some of the statistics which Dr. Sykes reported to the St. Pancras Borough Council in that year and those which I report today:— 1900. 1950. Population 243,076 141,300 Births 6,448 2,188 Birthrate 26.5 15.5 Deaths 4,655 1,630 Death rate 19.1 11.5 Infantile deaths 1,037 67 Infantile death rate 161 30.6 Smallpox— Cases 7 Nil Deaths Nil Nil Scarlet Fever— Cases 650 179 Deaths 10 Nil Diphtheria— Cases 585 Nil Deaths 71 Nil Typhoid— Cases 356 3 Deaths 63 Nil These figures speak for themselves. If they indicate the progress that has been made in the last 50 years they must none the less be an inspiration to us to secure that work so well founded by our predecessors shall continue in those years for which we may be responsible. 5 Last year I referred to the fact that since the passing of the National Health Service Act of 1946, attention has been focussed on the cure of sickness rather than on its prevention. During the year one Medical Officer of Health likened the present position to that of a manufacturer who found that many of his products were being returned to him owing to a defect which was inherent in the system of manufacture. This Medical Officer of Health wisely asked—" Would such a manufacturer set up a special department and engage staff with the object of remedying the defective goods as they were returned to him and rest satisfied that he was doing all that was necessary, or would he on the other hand look for the cause of the defect and eradicate it in manufacture, thus setting up only a temporary department to deal with the defective goods already manufactured ? "The answer is obvious and it applies in Public Health in the same way as it does in the field of commerce. To.day we hear much about the difficulty of obtaining admission of patients to hospital, and we are duly distressed when this applies even to acute cases. Whilst Public Health must be prepared to deal with illness as it arises and make available every method of cure it must aim at finding the cause of disease, eradicating it, and thus limiting the call for hospital beds. The Public Health Departments of local authorities are primarily charged with keeping residents healthy and happy in their own homes. I can imagine no greater responsibility nor one that is a greater challenge to their initiative and foresight than that of the care of the aged, a problem of increasing importance to.day. In these opening remarks of my Annual Report I hope to show how to some extent this challenge has been met in the Borough of St. Pancras. The problem of the aged has been one which has given us concern for many years, and a determination to achieve the maximum possible improvement in the care of the aged has resulted in the formation of a constructive policy. It is not suggested for one moment that there were no voluntary societies in the borough doing excellent work, for indeed there were. As in the past, however, there has been shown a need for co.ordination and co.operation aided by financial assistance. The Council has met this need by instigating the formation of the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged. This Association consists of 22 members, 12 nominated by the Borough Council, eight nominated by the voluntary societies working in the borough and the General Consultant to St. Pancras Hospital. The President is the Mayor of the borough for the time being. The St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged held its first meeting in April' 1950. It set up six working committees to consider the following subjects:— Meals. Medical Services. Wireless, amusements, etc. Clubs. Home Visiting. Housing. Each of these committees submitted a report. As a result thereof there has commenced a scheme in St. Pancras which is already bearing fruit. May I refer to a few of the achievements which have been accomplished. 6 At the time of writing this report meals in the home have been provided to about 80 housebound persons. In most cases the recipient has a meal brought to him five days a week. The number of recipients at any one time is approximately 50 and about 800 meals are being provided each month. It will be seen therefore that the population receiving meals in their own homes is not static : in some cases meals are only needed during temporary illness, in other cases they are stopped on account of death or admission to hospital. I am satisfied that these meals have been well received. They improve the health of many old people and promote happiness and comfort. There are in addition a number of old people who by reason of their own infirmity or lack of accommodation, cannot prepare meals regularly for themselves in their own homes. For these, arrangements are made for them to receive a grant towards the cost of a meal in one of the L.C.C. restaurants in the borough. Dr. Tracy and I have been impressed by the fact that a number of old people do not seem to be adequately nourished and that this inanition results in anaemia and a certain amount of mental inertia and depression. We are optimistic enough to express the hope that the provision of meals to many of these people will mean an improvement, not only in physical but also in mental health. We have reason for this statement for we have often noted the improvement which has resulted from the admission of old people to hospital or institution as a result of the provision of good food alone, apart from other treatment. Holidays of a fortnight's duration have been supplied at the time of writing this report to 65 old persons. The average age of one party who had a holiday at Ramsgate was 74.25. A wireless set has been provided to 18 old persons, and comforts such as hot water bottles and the like to a number of others. One of the troubles of old age, however, is loneliness. The St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged is attempting to meet this by enrolling the services of a large number of ladies and gentlemen who are prepared to visit one, two or even more old people regularly each week and to report to me their needs and troubles. There are about 140 persons being visited by such voluntary helpers. In addition to this, at the request of the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged, the Council has appointed a Health Officer, who is a trained nurse, to make routine visits to old persons living in a specific area of the borough. Miss Mackie commenced her duties on 27th November, 1950. Lastly, we have commenced a clinic where old people can come and consult Dr. Tracy, your Deputy Medical Officer of Health, and at this clinic there is held a regular chiropody session. It may be thought that this report on the work of the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged is out of place in my annual survey. The St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged is a voluntary association. It receives, however, a substantial grant from the Council which initiated its formation. It represents a happy co.operation between local authority and voluntary association. Senior officers of your Council are Honorary Officers of the Association and we trust that the S.P.A.C.A. has been formed on a firm and sound basis. I personally am grateful both to the voluntary associations and to the Council for the opportunity that has been afforded me to help a section of persons in this borough in need of the services that are being provided. 7 Underground Bakehouses. In accordance with the requirements of the Factories Act, 1937, an inspection of underground bakehouses must be carried out every five years. Such an inspection was carried out during 1950. Section 54 of the Act provides that a basement bakehouse shall not be used unless it was so used at the date of the passing of the Act, 1st July, 1938, and a Certificate of Suitability has been issued by the Borough Council. Together with the appropriate members of the staff I visited every underground bakehouse in the borough and submitted a report to the Council through its Public Health Committee. There are in the borough 26 underground bakehouses. All of them are long established and were probably erected many years ago. They are usually entered by means of a steep staircase from street level and are enclosed by high walls preventing the free circulation of air. Fresh air is often drawn into these bakehouses by means of openings at pavement level, allowing dirt and dust to enter from the street. Lighting is largely artificial and not always very good, corners and sides of shelves being badly lighted. During the war a number of underground bakehouses discontinued business altogether, and within the last five years, four occupiers of bakehouses have removed or ceased to bake. A large proportion of underground bakehouses in the borough are family businesses, the occupier of the bakehouse living above and managing the bakehouse himself with the assistance of members of his family. In my report I paid tribute to many of these occupiers for the standard of hygiene they have attained. Giving full consideration to all the circumstances it was as high as could be expected in the majority of cases, and I felt certain that had these family bakehouses been established in modern premises, properly constructed at ground floor level, they would have been so conducted as to be an example and a pride to the trade of baker. Before a Certificate of Suitability is granted the Council must be satisfied as to construction, including height, light, ventilation and other hygienic aspects of the premises with relation to the business of baking itself and the health of the persons employed therein. It is a serious matter for a baker to be refused a Certificate of Suitability for it may. mean difficulty or even impossibility of continuing his trade. The occupier of the bakehouse has the right to appear before the Council and state his case, and he also has a right of appeal to a Court of summary jurisdiction. To assist the Public Health Committee in its deliberations, the advice of the St. Pancras Association of the London Master Bakers, Confectioners and Caterers was sought. At every one of the meetings we held to consider individual bakehouses representatives of this Association were present, and every decision that was made was endorsed by, in fact was made in conjunction with, these representatives. It is a fact that the Master Bakers thanked the Council for their sympathetic understanding of the problem, but I know that the Council will agree that it is indebted to the Master Bakers for their help. In no case was an appeal made to the Court, which would suggest that the bakers themselves were satisfied that our decisions were equitable, sympathetic and wise. The following decisions were made:— A Certificate of Suitability was granted for five years in two cases without qualification. In two cases a Certificate of Suitability was granted but it was understood that at the end of five years the bakehouse was to be closed. In one case a Certificate of Suitability was given for five years subject to the use of the premises remaining as at present. 8 The remaining bakehouses were to be closed as follows:— Forthwith 4 Within six months 4 Within one year 1 Within two years 8 Within three years 1 Not to be closed while in present ownership 3 It will be seen that at the end of five years there should not be more than five underground bakehouses in the borough. In the meanwhile existing bakehouses are being improved, in accordance with undertakings which were given by many bakers when they stated their case before the appropriate Sub.Committee. Statistics. There were 2,188 births to St. Pancras residents during the year. This is 102 less than last year. The birth rate has dropped from 16.2 to 15.5, the death rate from 12.5 to 11.5 The infantile mortality rate is 30.6, the same as last year. Attention has recently been called to the number of deaths from tuberculosis. It has been pointed out that not only is the death rate falling but also the notification rate. In St. Pancras there were 76 deaths from tuberculosis compared with 105 in 1949, and the tuberculosis death rate has fallen from .74 to .54 per 1,000 population. The number of notifications last year was 376 compared with 352 in 1949. I think it important that we should realise the position as to tuberculosis in the borough. The fall in the death rate is largely due to better methods of treatment, resulting from new surgical methods and the use of streptomycin and para.aminosalicylic acid. This fall in the death rate, however, does not mean that there are fewer cases of tuberculosis, possibly infectious tuberculosis, in the borough. It may mean quite the opposite in that persons suffering from tuberculosis live longer than they did in past years. The following table shows the number of persons living in St. Pancras notified as suffering from tuberculosis and a comparison with past years shows that the number of names on the register is increasing. Year Pulmonary Non.Pulmonary Total 1945 964 155 1,119 1946 1,012 159 1,171 1947 1,069 156 1,225 1948 1,128 177 1,305 1949 1,180 176 1,356 1950 1,250 186 1,436 There is in fact every need to investigate the conditions under which persons suffering from tuberculosis are living in the borough in order to satisfy ourselves not only that every form of treatment is available to them but that insofar as means are available they are living in conditions which will not result in the spread of infection. 9 During the year a visit was made to the home of every person notified as suffering from tuberculosis and within our means we have done our best to improve environmental conditions. I am hoping that in 1951 this work will not only be maintained but increased. Tuberculosis is not an acute infectious disease which spends itself in a period of days or weeks like other of the infectious diseases, after which the patient is in most cases no longer a source of infection. A person who contracts tuberculosis may remain infectious for many years, and it is essential that the conditions under which he lives and works, and in fact the type of work which he undertakes, should be known to the Public Health Department, and supervised insofar as this may be necessary in the interests of the health of the borough as a whole. Infectious Disease. It will be seen from the table on page 33 that the incidence of infectious disease was more or less the same as that in 1949. Notifications of food poisoning, however, were 41 as compared with 12 in the previous year. This was largely due to the occurrence of two outbreaks in a canteen in the borough. I do not think that the notifications are an absolute indication of the number of cases of illness due to food poisoning. In many cases mild symptoms occur and a doctor is not consulted. The notifications we do receive generally result from a definite outbreak affecting more than one person in a family or a number of people eating in a particular restaurant or canteen. Poliomyelitis. It will be noted that there were 26 cases of poliomyelitis (Infantile Paralysis) recorded during the year as compared with 66 in 1949. In no case was the disease associated, insofar as could be ascertained, with immunisation or any form of injection. Measles. It will be noted that not one child died from measles during the year. This happy situation has occurred only three times in the last 25 years, namely in 1939, 1942 and 1944. Work of Sanitary Inspectors The work of the district sanitary inspectors falls mainly into the following categories: (a) Repair and maintenance of house property. (b) Smoke abatement. (c) Inspection of premises selling certain poisons. (d) Drainage of both new and old buildings. (e) Inspections following complaint. (f) Abatement of nuisances other than housing matters. (g) Routine visits to blind and old persons. (h) Routine visits to licensed premises. (i) Routine visits to closed basement rooms. (j) Routine visits to homes where there has been infectious disease, including tuberculosis. (k) Survey of areas prior to compulsory purchase. (l) Survey of individual houses within the compulsory purchase area, for the purpose of assessing compensation where any premises are in a state of defective sanitation or are not in reasonably good repair. (m) Inspection of shops. 10 The repair and maintenance of house property represents the major work of the district sanitary inspectors and it cannot be over emphasised that a large percentage of the population of St. Pancras rely upon the work of these inspectors for the maintenance of reasonable housing conditions. The costs of repairs continues to create much difficulty, for landlords are continually complaining that whilst these have risen considerably they have not been allowed to increase their income by raising rents. During the year three areas containing 137 houses were surveyed and a report submitted prior to compulsory purchase by the Borough Council. These reports were accompanied by plans of the areas and provided an overall picture of the sites, including the number of houses existing thereon, the number of lettings, the number of rooms and the number of occupants. These surveys enabled the Council to appreciate not only the type of property that will be demolished but also the number of individuals and families who would need rehousing. A survey was also carried out to see whether the provisions of the Housing Act, 1949, could be brought into operation to improve areas in the borough. An area was chosen for this survey which contained 141 houses. The total number of rooms was 1,000. There were 385 lettings and 837 occupants. The survey elicited the information that if the houses in the area were improved and modern amenities provided for the occupants in accordance witli the requirements of the Act, additional accommodation to the extent of 252 rooms would have to be provided elsewhere. Schedule 4—Housing Act, 1936. Where a house is compulsorily purchased by the Borough Council it is necessary for the purpose of assessing the purchase price to ascertain whether the property is in a state of defective sanitation or is not in reasonably good repair. The surveys for this purpose are undertaken by your district sanitary inspectors. A complete inspection of the property is required both internally and externally and copies of the schedules so prepared are forwarded to the Council's Valuer. During the year 151 houses were surveyed under this heading. I am now left with the pleasant task of conveying to the Council my thanks for the courtesy I have received at all times during the year. No Medical Officer could have been afforded happier and better opportunities of carrying out his work than those extended to me by the St. Pancras Borough Council, and for this I am duly grateful. May I mention in particular the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, Councillor Evan Evans, whose help and judgment I have appreciated throughout the two years he has held this office. His tact and wisdom, his sympathy and understanding were particularly apparent when we had the task of considering the underground bakehouses in the borough. To my colleagues and the members of my department I would also like to pay a tribute for their happy co.operation and help during 1950. Lastly I would wish to recognise the help and co.operation of my colleagues in the medical profession, both specialists and general practitioners, whose help 1 have been happy to receive at all times, and to the voluntary associations with whom it has been a pleasure to work. I beg to remain, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, DENNIS H. GEFFEN, . Medical Officer of Health. 11 Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE.

Net registered live births 2,188 Birth.rate (per 1,000 of estimated population) 15.5 Deaths, all ages 1,630 *Crude death rate (per 1,000 of estimated population) 11.5 Adjusted death rate (per 1,000 of estimated population) 11.6 Infantile deaths 67 Infantile death rate (per 1,000 live births) 30.6 Tuberculosis deaths 76 Tuberculosis death rate (per 1,000 of estimated population) .54 * The crude death rate of the area is multiplied by the factor 1.01 in order to make it comparable, from a mortality point of view, with the crude death rate of the country as a whole, or with the mortality of any other local area, the crude death rate of which should be similarly modified with its own factor for the purpose. The necessity for the application of this factor arises from the fact that the populations of all areas are not similarly constituted as regards the proportions of their sex and age group components. Crude death rates fail as true comparative mortality indexes in that their variations are not due to mortality alone, but arise also from differences in their population constitution, the two elements being combined in indistinguishable proportions. The factor may be said to represent the population handicap to be applied to the area. Applied to St. Pancras, the death rate of 11.5 per 1,000 of population is adjusted by the comparability factor of 1.01 to 11.6 per 1,000 of population. Marriages.

Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1930. The total number of primary notifications during the year was 263, in addition to which 25 cases not previously notified came to knowledge by means of special death reports, and 88 cases by transfer from other districts. The total number of new cases from all sources was therefore 376, equal to a notification rate of 2.66 per 1,000 of population, compared with 352 new cases during the previous year, with a notification rate of 2.49 per 1,000 population. The deaths from all forms of tuberculosis during the year numbered 76, equal to a death rate of 0.54 per 1,000 of population, whereas the total number of deaths in the previous year was 105 with a death rate of 0.74 per 1,000 population. It will be noted that, out of a total of 76 deaths from tuberculosis, 25 (being 32.9 per cent.) were of cases which were notified only at death. Death from tuberculosis without prior notification of the disease may be due to— (a) sudden death of a person who has not consulted a doctor since tuberculosis has developed; (b) sudden death of a person who has been notified elsewhere but has not consulted a doctor since arrival in the Borough; (c) difficulty in diagnosis before death; (d) the doctor being under an erroneous impression that the case had been notified in the Borough previously. The number of primary notifications of Tuberculosis and those which came to knowledge by means of death reports and transfers from other districts, as well as deaths during the year, are given in the following three tables:— Number of Primary Notifications.

The bulk of the water in the Borough is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. There are five wells in the borough, four being on factory premises and one at the Council's swimming baths at Prince of Wales Road. In addition, wells situated outside the borough are a source of supply to various points on the railway system centred on Euston Station. Ken Wood and Parliament Hill Fields open air ponds, the Council's swimming baths at Prince of Wales Road, and a private swimming bath have all received periodic visits of the Council's Inspectors. Samples of water have been taken regularly and subjected to chemical and bacteriological examination by the Public Analyst. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. The following applications were received during 1950 for retention or entry in the Council's list of persons entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List:— Retentions 155 New entries 7 Total 162 163 inspections were made by the Council's sanitary inspectors during the year.

Inspections were made by the Council's Sanitary Inspectors and the prescribed forms forwarded to the London County Council in respect of these cases. 480 families were found to be overcrowded. The following shows the categorical placings of the 10,365 families on the Borough Council's housing waiting list at the end of the year:— Urgent priority "A" cases 1,850 Priority "B" cases 371 Priority "C" cases 215 Others 7,929 48 My recommendations in respect of the 729 cases referred to me by the Housing Department during the year were as follows:— Certificate "A" 316 „ "B" 119 „ "C" 200 „ "D" 94 Medical Examinations. Ninety-seven medical examinations were carried out by myself and Dr. Tracy to ascertain whether personnel were fit for entry into superannuation or sick pay schemes or for special purposes. The following table sets out the results of such examinations:— New Entrants— Fit 76 Unfit 7 — 83 Special Examinations— Recommended to be retired on account of permanent ill-health or for employment not involving heavy manual strain 10 Recommended as capable to continue employment 2 Examined as to fitness to attend A.R.P course—found to be unfit 1 As to fitness to surrender part of superannuation—found to be fit 1 — 14 97 Blind Persons. There are 89 registered blind persons resident in the Borough of St. Pancras. During the year six were admitted to hospital, institution or home, three left the borough and four died. Visits were paid at least once in the year to ascertain whether there were any sanitary defects requiring attention which might not have been noticed by the blind persons. National Assistance Act, 1948. Section 47. During the year visits were paid to 62 persons where information had been received by the Public Health Department that an individual was unable on account of age or infirmity of taking care of himself. In practically every case it was found possible either to persuade the person concerned to enter hospital or a suitable institution voluntarily or to maintain him or her in his own home by the provision of suitable amenities. In two cases it was necessary to ask a Magistrate for an Order under the Act. Section 50—Burials. During the year 84 cases were dealt with at a total cost of £699 10s., of which £668 17s. 5d. was recovered by the Department, leaving a net cost to the Council of £30 12s. 7d. 49 Mortuary and Coroner's Court.

Seven operatives and one Rodent Officer, working under the supervision of a Sanitary Inspector, were employed on rodent control. 1,529 premises were treated and 6,007 investigated. 13,360 visits were made for laying and checking prebaits and poison baits. There is no doubt that this service is greatly appreciated by the public, who readily avail themselves of the facilities offered. With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department two sewer campaigns were undertaken. Despite increases in the size of poison bait laid there has been no noticeable reduction in the level of rat population in the sewers since the first drive on sewer rats in 1943. There is no doubt, however, that any slackening in this work would result in increases in the rat population and their more frequent appearance at ground level. 50 SECTION 5.

Outworkers. In certain industries specified in the Act, if work is given out by employers or contractors to be done by workers in their own homes, lists containing the names and addresses of such workers must be forwarded to the Local Authority, with the object of preventing work being carried out in premises which are insanitary or in which infectious disease is present. The following table gives the number of such premises in the borough, and the nature of the work carried out:— Wearing apparel 492 Household linen 21 Lace, Lace curtains and nets 21 Curtains and furniture hangings 10 Furniture and upholstery 5 Brass and brass articles 16 Fur pulling 18 Artificial flowers 14 The making of boxes or other receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or partially of paper 6 Brush making 3 Feather sorting 12 Carding, etc., of buttons, etc. 7 Stuffed toys 8 Basket making 2 Cosaques, Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings, etc. 19 Lampshades 10 Total 664 Informal action was taken in four cases of default in sending lists to the Council, and in 10 cases of work in unwholesome premises, resulting in the defaults and defects being remedied. 53 SECTION 6.

The Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949. The Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949. These Regulations re-enact with amendments the provisions of the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1936 to 1948 and became operative on the 1st October, 1949. They require, inter alia, the licensing of traders selling Sterilised Milk in addition to those selling Pasteurised and Tuberculin Tested Milks. The number of licences issued during 1950 were:— Main Licences Supplementary Licences To sell Pasteurised milk 148 24 To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 102 23 To sell Sterilised milk 164 23 Meat and Other Foods. (i) Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924. Periodical visits of inspection were made as follows:— Butchers' Shops 510 Prepared Meat premises 433 (ii) Inspection of other premises where food is prepared or offered for sale. The Food Inspectors have continued to keep all such premises under regular and frequent observation, the following inspections being made for this purpose:— Ice cream 769 Fishmongers 135 Fried fish 106 Others 1,378 55 Food Sampling. 957 samples (370 formal and 587 informal) were sent for analysis, of which three formal and two informal were found to be adulterated. Bacteriological Examination of Samples of Milk and Ice Cream. In addition to the samples of food submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination, a total of 298 samples were submitted either to the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, or the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, for bacteriological examination. (a) Milk. 152 samples of milk were taken from dairies and from the London County Council schools and institutions and day nurseries in the Borough to ascertain whether they complied with the appropriate regulations relating to specially designated milks. The samples were subjected to the phosphatase test, which indicates the efficiency of the method of heat treatment, and the methylene blue test indicating the keeping quality of the milk. All complied with the phosphatase test, and 148 of the 152 samples proved satisfactory in regard to the methylene blue test. Appropriate action was taken in the remaining four cases, and the follow-up samples were satisfactory. An analysis of these samples is given in the following table:— T.T. (Past) Past. Ster. H.T.

The improvement secured during previous years has been maintained and a considerably smaller proportion of samples fell within grade 4. Where unsatisfactory samples of ice cream were manufactured outside the Borough the Medical Officer of Health of the appropriate area was informed to enable him to investigate the conditions under which the commodity was produced. 56 The following table shows the detailed results of the bacteriological examination of ice cream samples during the year and preceding years:— — 1947 1948 1949 1950 Samples % Samples % Samples % Samples % Satisfactory Grade I 17 22.3 75 41.7 59 32.4 59 44.7 Grade II 14 18.4 38 21.1 52 29.0 40 30.3 Unsatisfactory Grade III 23 30.3 31 17.2 44 24.6 15 11.4 Grade IV 22 29.0 36 20.0 25 14.0 18 13.6 Totals 76 100.0 180 100.0 180 100.0 132 100.0 During the period covered by this report there was no legal chemical standard for the composition of ice-cream, although as from 1st March, 1951, the Food Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951, will become operative, prescribing the following minimum standards:— 5 per cent. fat. 10 per cent. sugar. 7½ per cent. milk solids other than milk fat. Pending the coming into force of the above-mentioned Order this department has, in co-operation with the Ministry of Food, taken 43 samples of ice cream for chemical analysis during the year, the results showing fat contents as summarised below.
