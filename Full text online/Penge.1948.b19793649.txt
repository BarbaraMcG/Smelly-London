To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, I beg to present an Annual Report on the health of the district for the year ended the 31st December, 1948. It is compiled in accordance with Circular 170 (1947) of the Ministry of Health. The report, in so far as the maternity and child welfare and ambulance services, deals only with the period up to July 5th, when the responsibility for their provision was transferred under the National Health Service Act, 1946 to the Kent County Council and the Regional Hospital Board. As expected, there was a drop in the birth rate but attendances at the various clinic sessions remained at a high level. It is pleasing to note that the death rate for infants under one year of age, constitutes a further low record for Penge. There was a great increase in the number of cases of measles notified, but the epidemic was of a mild type. No case of diphtheria occurred in the district during the year. Whilst it has not been found necessary to take action under Section 47, National Assistance Act, 1948, there were occasions when difficulty was experienced in obtaining admission to institutions of aged persons suffering from chronic illness, and in need of care and attention. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area (acres) 770 Population (Census, 1931) 27,771 Civilian Population mid-year, 1948 (estimated by Registrar-General) 24,710 Rateable Value, 1st October, 1948 £192,559 Sum represented by 1d. rate £785 The Manager of the Employment Exchange informed me that there were 130 persons unemployed in the Penge Urban District at the end of the year. 4 VITAL STATISTICS. Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Civilian population, 22.74. Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births, 21.35. Crude Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated Civilian population, 11.69.

Deaths among the inmates of an Institution for elderly men numbered 9. It should be noted that a large proportion of the deaths were of elderly people, and of the total deaths, 186 or 64.36 % were of persons 65 years of age and over, compared with 64.3% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 30.79 % of the total deaths. Cancer. The Cancer death rate per 1,000 civilian population was 2.10 compared with 1.55 in 1947. Maternal Mortality.

The number of deaths under one year of age was 17, corresponding to a rate of 30.25 per 1,000 births, compared with a rate of 32.59 for 1947, which was even lower than the previous lowest rate recorded in Penge. Of the 17 deaths, 11 died from unavoidable causes before reaching the age of one week.

Town Hall, Anerley Road, S.E.20. July, 1949. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you the Annual Report of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors for the year ended 31st December, 1948. There was again a large number of complaints received regarding defects and nuisances in houses. The requirements of the Notices served have again, of necessity, been restricted to the more serious defects. A great deal of work is still necessary to bring many houses in the district up to a reasonable standard of fitness. A large amount of repair work has, however, been done during the year, as will be seen on reference to the list of work executed. In many cases delay was occasioned in executing repairs required by notices owing to the negotiations between the owners of property and the War Damage Commission regarding War Damage, being prolonged. Owners were reluctant to put in hand any work until settlement was reached with the Commission. The cost of building repairs is considerably higher than in 1939 and when one considers that the standard rents of properties are the same now as in that year, it is not surprising to find some owners objecting to being called upon to execute extensive repairs. There are certain owners, however, who will not carry out their obligations regarding essential repairs to houses, and I regret to have to report that it was necessary to institute legal proceedings against them in order to abate nuisances caused by housing defects. 17 The following is a summary of these cases :- Case No. Result. 1. Nuisance Order made to do the work in 28 days and pay £1 9s. 6d. costs. 2. Nuisance Order made to do work in 28 days and pay £1 9s. 6d. costs. 3.
