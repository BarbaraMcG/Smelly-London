IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON. ANNUAL REPORT. Gentlemen, As I was only appointed to the position of your Vestry Clerk six weeks before the end of the year for which this report has to be made, I have had to extract from your minute book most of the following record of the work done since the 25tli March, 1890, up to February 9tli, the date of my appointment, which I have now the honour to present. POOR RATE. During the year ended 25tli March, 1891, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £93,977 4s. 9d.; the amount levied in the £ for the year was 3s. 2d. (being for the quarter to Midsummer, l0d.; to Michaelmas, l0d.; to Christmas, 9d.; to Lady-day, 9d.) The previous year's Poor's Rate amounted to 2/11 in the £. The amount paid to the Shoreditch Board of Guardians under their Contribution Orders was £70,200; and a sum of £8,000 was owing to them at Lady-day, 1891, to cover their expenditure for the year. Further detailed particulars of the Income and Expenditure on the Poor Rate account will be' found in the statistical abstract. VESTRY RATES. Full details of the Income and Expenditure for the year on account of the General and Sewers Rate are furnished by the Accountant. The total amount collected on the Vestry Rates for the year was £61,841 4s. 3d.; and out of this sum the School Board for London received £28,561 1s. 2d. This charge is based upon the net rateable annual value of the property, according to the Valuation List, and no reduction is made for empty houses, nor for allowance to owners in respect thereof. 4 The rates levied for tho year ending 25th March, 1891, were-— General Rale 2s. Od. in the £ Sewers Rate 0s. 1d. ,, 2s. 1d. as against— General Rate 2s. Od. in the C Sewers Rate 0s. 2d. ,, 2s. 2d. for tho year ending 25th March, 1890. ASSESSMENT. The year 1890 being the year for tho Quinquennial Valuation of the Parish, the Valuation Committee issued a now valuation list, and the Assessment Committee revised the list and heard a large nurnbor of appeals from persons assessed. From eight of their decisions on these appeals, the appellants appealed to Quarter Sessions, with the result that three were dismissed, four were compromised before coming into Court, and one is still pending. The result of the re-valuation is as follows :— Year commencing 6 April, 1890. Year commencing 6 April, 1891. Increase. £ £ £ Gross Estimated Rental 794,141 825,908 31,707 Rateable Value 644,844 682,828 37,484 The following statement shows tho number of Assessments and Rateable Value of tho Parish. WARD.

The St. Luke's Workhouse and Infirmary, situated i;i Shepherdess Walk, and belonging to the Holborn Board of Guardians, is only rated at £19, pursuaut to Sec. 45 of the Act of 48, Geo. III., cap. 97. The St. Luke's Vestry Hall, situated in City Road and belonging to the Vestry of the Parish of St. Luke, is not rated, although it is within the boundary of Shoreditch, owing to the provisions of a local Act. PAROCHIAL CHARITIES. At the beginning of the official year the Vestry considered the Report of the Charity Enquiry Committee appointed 27th March, 1888, which had been printed with the Minutes of Evidence taken before the Assistant Charity Commissioner in June, 1889, and the same was finally approved and adopted by the Vestry on 1st April, 1890. These volumes have been circulated amongst the members of the Vestry, as well as distributed free of charge to the Working Men's Clubs in the Parish, and speak for themselves. AVEBB'S GIFT. At the instance of a local Association this oft recurring question again occupied the attention of the Vestry for several meetings, with the result that in June, 1890, the Vestry, upon the advice of Counsel and the late Mr. Walker, presented a petition to Parliament in favour of Professor Stuart's Motion for an Address to Her Majesty in Council, praying that the Scheme of the Charity Commissioners for the better management of Christ's Hospital might be amended so that a larger number of children should be allotted to Shoreditch under the terms of Thomas Webb's bequest; but these efforts were without avail, and the original Scheme of the Charity Commissioners, so far as regards Shoreditch, remains untouched, and according to this Scheme the management of Christ's Hospital is vested in the Governors and Almoners, the powers of each being strictly defined. The management of the schools, however, will lie with the Council of Almoners, which will consist of about forty persons. Twenty are to be nominated by 6 the Governors, six by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, six by the London School Board, and the rest by the Universities and by certain high officials. There are to be three boarding-schools "within a convenient distance of the City of London" —one for boys, with 700 places; one for girls, with 350 places; and a preparatory school, with 120 places. One-third of the places are to be absolutely free; and as regards the other twothirds, the parents will contribute from £10 to £20 a year for each child. Christ's Hospital presentations will still be to a large extent a matter of favour, but one hundred and seventy-nine places on the Foundation will be open to the competition of children who for three years previously have been in attendance at a public elementary school. A day school for boys, and another for girls, are to be established within three miles of the Royal Exchange, the former to accommodate 600 and the latter 400 scholars, the fees payable being from £5 to £10 per annunl. There are, however, to be 300 free places in the former school and 200 in the latter, open to the competition of children attending public elementary schools. A small sum is set aside to assist very poor parents in the maintenance of such children, and £1,500 a year is to be applied in maintaining exhibitions of the value of £40 each, tenable at any place of advanced education. Many of these provisions will tend to the increased usefulness of Christ's Hospital as an educational institution; but the claims of Shoreditch to a larger recognition under the bequest of Thomas Webb, which now brings in £1,300 a year, and is sufficient to maintain 20 more children than are at present received under the bequest, have been ignored. PLANTING TREES. The Metropolitan Public Gardens Association having offered to hand over to the Vestry £100 to be expended in the planting of young plane trees in suitable parts of the Parish, the Vestry very gladly accepted this kind offer, and the Association provided the trees, which have been planted in the following positions :— In Old Street (by the Obelisk) 5 ,, St. John's Road 4 ,, Hackney Road 5 ,, Brunswick Street 5 ,, Kingsland Road (opposite Workhouse) 4 ,, ,, ,, (opposite St. Columba Church) 4 ,, Hoxton Street (opposite Infirmary 3 ,, Queen's Road (West and North sides of Clarence Terrace) 11 ,, Kingsland Road 20 ,, Hows Street (by St. Mary's School) 3 50 The Association also supplied the soil, and the Vestry bears the cost of the guards, grating and lixing, and the cost of watering. The Association's gardener lately inspected tlie trees, and reports that they are in good condition, and it is hoped that in a few years they will afford an agreeable feature in some of the thoroughfares of the Parish. 7 TOWN HALL, Du he year the Large Hall has been let 120 times; the Council Chamber 30 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by local Societies on several occasions The receipts for hire of Hall, Council Chamber and Committee Rooms for the financial year ended 25th March last, were £633 12s. 6d. On the 2nd day of December, 1890, the London County Council served a requisition on the Vestry stating certain structural alterations which were necessary in the opinion of the Council to make the Hall safe in case of panic from Fire. The Vestry on the same date directed the Surveyor of the Vestry to confer with the Council's Surveyor and draw up plans showing the proposed alterations, and the matter is still under the consideration of the Vestry, NEW OFFICES FOR SANITARY DEPARTMENT. In consequence of the increasing demands made upon the Sanitary Department by the passing of new Acts relating to the public health, the small oftice hitherto used by them was found totally inadequate for the proper carrying on of their work, More commodious offices were therefore found for this Department in the room at the north-east corner of the basement, which was properly fitted up at a total cost of £170 4s. 0d.. Mr. Tliomerson's tender being accepted for the work, which included the fixing of new stone area steps and railing, by which the public now gain direct access to the new offices from Old Street. The lobby at the entrance door of the Hall being thus vacated, is now used by the Hall Keeper as an Enquiry Office, from 9 till 5, Under this arrangement Mr. Filmer is relieved of the actual work of cleaning the Hall, which is done under his supervision by one permanent and two occasional assistants, at 25/- per week and 4/- per day respectively. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACT, 1890. Section 26 (2) of this Act casts additional duty upon the Medical Officer, who is empowered to grant a certificate of sanitary fitness of certain premises, upon which such premises would be exempted from inhabited house duty. The Section provides that the assessment to inhabited house duty of any house originally built or adapted by additions or alterations, and used for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings for persons at rents not exceeding for each dwelling he rate of seven shillings and sixpence a week, and occupied only by persons paying such rents, is to be discharged by the Commissioners acting in the execution of the Acts relating to the inhabited house duties, provided that a certificate is produced to them to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements. The certificate is to be obtained from the Medical Officer of Health fcr the district in which the house is situate. 8 The Act makes it the duty of the Medical Officer of Health of a district, on request by the person who would be liable to pay the house duty on any house in the district, if the duty were not discharged by the Commissioners, to examine the ho die for the purpose of ascertaining whether a certificate can properly be given; and if the house is constructed so as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, and due provision is made for their sanitary requirements, he is to certify the same accordingly. This is a very useful provision in the interests of the public health, and the Medical Officer of Health of this Vestry has already certified numerous houses under its provisions. GOVERNMENT ENQUIRY INTO THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISH. In August, 1889, the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the Poor, supplied the Vestry with lists of sanitary defects in 10G8 premises which its officers had discovered in certain districts of the Parish which they had inspected. By the end of December, 1889, the Sanitary Department had dealt with 609 of the premises complained of, leaving only 159 to be remedied. This rate of progress did not, however, satisfy the Mansion House Council, who obtained an Address of the House of Commons requiring the Secretary of State to institute a public enquiry into the sanitary condition of certain premises in this Parish. The Home Secretary accordingly appointed Mr. D. C. Nichols and Dr. Edward Seaton to hold such Enquiry at the Town Hall. The Commission began its sittings on 12th November, 1890, Mr. E. Lewis Thomas appearing as Counsel for the Vestry, and Mr. Corrie Grant as Counsel for the Mansion House Council, whilst Messrs. E. Moffatt and C. W. Brabher, the gentlemen nominated by the Vestry to co-operate with the Commissioners in such Enquiry, attended in such capacity. Seven witnesses were examined and the arguments of Counsel heard, and the Enquiry was completed on the 15th December. The results of the Enquiry have been printed as a Government paper, as ordered by the House of Commons, and this lias been distributed amongst Vestrymen. It will be sufficient here to set forth the following extract from that Report, a more detailed reference to which will be found in Inspector Alexander's Report. The contention of the Mansion House Council, as stated by their Counsel, was:— 1. That the sanitary staff of the Vestry, though efficient en personnel, is insufficient in number. 2. That the present Acts for dealing with sanitary and cognate matters in the parish are inefficiently carried out. 9 In reply, the contention of the Vestry was :— 1. That having regard to the density of the population, the general death-rate of the parish is not abnormally high. 2. That the number of sanitary improvements of houses throughout the whole parish effected during the past few years shows that the sanitary staff is both vigilant and efficient. 3. That the decline in the mortality returns from typhoid fever which has been marked and continuous since 1880, is positive evidence of the value of these operations in causing a large reduction in preventable sickness in the parish. The Commissioners speak in praise of the quality of the Vestry's work, but complain of its insufficiency in quantity. They briefly summarise the immediate sanitary requirements of Shoreditch, as follows :— 1. An extension of the work of subsoil and house drainage, the det.iils of which have been so well executed under the supervision of the Vestry's sanitary staff, and an enlargement of the staff to enable this and similar work to be effected. To this end the appointment of an additional inspector is imperative. The staff for the parish would then consist of :— A Medical Officer of Health Two Assistant Inspectors A Public Analyst A Clerk A Chief Inspector A Disinfecting Officer A Second Inspector 2. The adoption and enforcement of tenement regulations, and the institution of systematic house-to-house inspection. 3. The more complete exercise of the powers of the Nuisance Removal and other Sanitary Acts by necessary magisterial proceedings. The Commissioners also complain that they found the paving and drainage of the roads and streets (especially some of the smaller streets) to be very defective. They point out that there are no tenement house regulations in force, and severely condemn many of the so-called 'Model blocks' of dwellings built on the flat system, but for the presence of these the Vestry cannot be held responsible, as they have no power to prevent them. The Report lias been forwarded by the Home Secretary to the Vestry, with a request that they may take immediate action thereon, and the recommendations are now under the consideration of the Vestry. 10 THE VESTRY CLERKSHIP. The Report of the Special Committee appointed on the decease of the late Vestry Clerk to superintend and carry on the duties of his office pending the appointment of hie successor, fully sets out the business with which they dealt, and is as follows:— REPORT. On the 15th July, Mr. Walker, the late Vestry Clerk, submitted a communication to the Vestry, in which he stated that in consequence of a weakening complaint from which he was suffering, lie would not for some little time be able to give that full attention to his duties which they required, and asking for the indulgence of the Vestry, until by means of the rest which his physician recommended him to take, he should be restored to health. In spite, however, of the rest which he was able to obtain during the vacation, Mr. Walker's ill-health increased, and after a brief but severe illness which set in whilst he was away from town, he died at his residence on the 9th September, 1890. This sad occurrence was reported to the Vestry .at its next meeting, when the Vestry directed a letter of sympathy and condolence with his widow and family to be forwarded to Mrs. Walker, and, before rising, passed the following Resolution:— "That a Special Committee of seven Members be appointed to supervise and generally direct the work of the Vestry, until the election of a Vestry Clerk; and to consider and recommend to the Vestry as early as possible, the best mode of election, and the remuneration of a successor to the late Mr. Walker." The seven Members thereupon appointed were— Mr. Belstead Mr. Moffatt ,, Cox ,, Wenbokn ,, Martindill ,, Winkler ,, M. Moss and Mr. Wenbokn was elected Chairman. The Committee at once entered upon its duties, and held during the interregnum, no less than 18 meetings, the greater number of these being devoted to the examination and separation of the late Clerk's public and private papers, the purely private documents being duly handed over to the Executor, Mr. J. J. Griffiths, and the supervision of the Vestry's general work, which necessitated the giving directions and assistance to the heads of Departments. The carrying out of the duties comprised in the first branch of the reference to the Committee was rendered somewhat more difficult by the sudden indisposition of the Assistant Clerk, Mr. H. E. Jones, but beyond the Chairman's daily attendance at the Office to open letters, Ac., no further difficulty was occasioned, as the work of the Vestry Clerk s Office was, under the supervision of the Committee, efficiently carried out l»y Mr. Burton and Mr. Bennett, willingly assisted by the rest of the Staff, 11 The Committee then turned its attention to the second branch of the reference, as to the best mode of election of, and the remuneration to be paid to, the late Clerk's successor; and early in November the Committee recommended to the Vestry:— "That tbe salary of the Vestry Clerk begin at £400, rising by yearly increments of £25 until a maximum of £500 be reached; also that advertisements be issued in certain papers, and that the Committee be empowered to open applications, interview selected candidates, and nominate six to be returned 10 the Vestry for its appointment of one by the method of Exhaustive Ballot." The Vestry adopted the above recommendation adding alter the word "rising" the words "subject to the approval of the Vestry," and making certain alterations in some minor details of the Report. Although the question of the duties of the new Officer lay outside the Vestry's reference, it happened, rather opportunely, that the Officers' Committee were concurrently occupied with the important work of drawing up a code of duties to be performed by tbe Chief Officer, and its Report, comprised in a pamphlet of 11 pages and 31 clauses, was adopted by the Vestry with certain amendments, on the 21st October, 1890. Advertisements for Candidates were issued, and the Special Committee supplied each of the 300 applicants with a list of the duties of the office. Of the 300 forms sent out, 100 were returned, from which the Committee selected 28 gentlemen for interview and examination, finally nominating the following six as the Candidates to be submitted to the Vestry, viz. :— Mr. R. S. Bain, of Balliam. ,, F. J. Lampard, London. ,, H. M. Robinson, LL.B. (Lond.), Nottingham. ,, C. W. Tagg, Camberwell. ,, J. B. Ward, London. ,, G. Wainwright, Penrith. On the 13th January, 1891, Mr. Hugh Mansfield Robinson, of the Guildhall, Nottingham, who had then obtained the higher degree of LL.D. (Lond.), was appointed Vestry Clerk of the Parish, and commenced his duties on the 9th February, 1891. An Agreement between the Vestry and himself was at the Vestry Meeting on the 17lh Febiuary, 1891, sealed and signed by the Chairman and several Members of the Vestry, and the Vestry Clerk. The Agreement provides that the Vestry Clerk is to perform the legal work of the Vestry, and the cost of his practising certificate and subscription to a law libiary is to be paid by the Vestry. A guarantee of £500 is to be provided by the Vestry Clerk, the Vestry paying the premiums, and this guarantee has since been given.. The Vestry Clerk is to devote all his time to his duties. 12 In addition to the matters originally referred to the Committee, they were asked by the Vestry to consider and report upon an application by Mr. Jones, the Assistant Clerk, for extra remuneration in respect of additional services rendered by him in consequence of tlie absence through ill-health of the late Vestry Clerk. The Committee recommended that £20 be paid to Mr. Jones in respect of such extra services, which was adopted, by the Vestry, who at the same time granted, upon the recommendation of the Committee, the sum of £10 to Mr. Burton. F. M. WENBORN, Choir,nan. Tho Report concludes with the following addendum:— The Members of tho Committee cannot lot this opportunity pass without expressing their high appreciation of tho exceptionally valuable services rendered by their Chairman (Mr. Wenborn), in connection with the work of this Committee, which has cast a large amount of work and responsibility upon him. They have unanimously resolved therefore, to recommend the Vestry:— To pass a very cordial vote of thanks to Mr. Wenborn, for the laborious and valuable services he has rendered to tho Vestry during the interregnum. Tho above Report was adopted, and the vote of thanks to Mr. Wenborn passed by the Vestry, on tho 1st September, 1891, and it was resolved that the same should bo incorporated in tho Annual Report. APPLICATION ON BEIIALF OF WIDOW OF LATE VESTRY CLERK. The financial affairs of the late Clerk, as between tho Vestry and his Executor (Mr. Griffiths), having been settled, Mr. Griffiths submitted a communication asking tho Vestry, in consideration of the ability with which Mr. Walker had served the Parish for twenty years, during tho last few years of which term ho had done so against extreme physical weakness, to give its kind consideration to tho case of the widow, who had been loft only a small sum to provide for tho future. This request was referred to tho Vestry's Solicitors to advise as to tho legality of a gratuity to Mrs. Walker. The result of their enquiries was to the effect that a gift could not be made out of the rates for this purpose, and they could not therefore advise the allowance. Under these circumstances tho Vestry was unable to accode to tho request of Mr. Griffiths. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. This Act is one of the most important measures which have passed of late years in the interests of tho public health. Previously, the general law relating to tho housing ol the working classes was for the most part contained in three scries of statutes commonly known as Cross's Acts, Torren's Acts, and Shaftesbury's Acts. Of these, Cross's Acts enabled the London County Council to obtain by means of Provisional Orders confirmed by Parliament, power to carry out large improvement schemes for the reconstruction and rearrangement of tho streets and houses in unhealthy areas. 13 Torren's Act empowered Metropolitan Vestries to take proceedings for securing the improvement or demolition of houses in a state dangerous to health, so as to unfit them for human habitation, and also to deal with "obstructive buildings," i.e., buildings which, although not in themselves unfit for human habitation, were so situated that by reason of their proximity to other dwellings, they either stopped ventilation, or made, or conduced to make, such other buildings to be in a condition unfit for human habitation, or prevented proper measures from being carried into effect for remedying the evils complained of iu respect of them. Shaftesbury's Acts might be adopted, subject to certain restrictions, by the London County Council in any district, and enable the Council at the cost of the rates to provide lodging houses for letting to the labouring classes. These last mentioned Acts had become, however, practically obsolete. In London good work had been done at a very heavy expense under Cross's Acts, but comparatively little action had been taken under Torrens's Acts, the provisions of which, though admirable in design, had been found in practice almost unworkable bv reason of the cumbrous and dilatory proceedings which they required to be taken before an insanitary dwelling could be closed or demolished under them, and the numerous opportunities which they afforded to the owners of appealing against the decisions of the local authorities. By Part II. of the present Act the procedure to be taken by local authorities under Torrens's Acts has been materially simplified; and facilities have been given for the carrying out of schemes for the reconstruction and rearrangement of insanitary buildings on a smaller scale than was practicable, and by a less elaborate machinery than was available under Cross's Acts. Part I. of the present Act repeals and re-enacts Cross's Acts with certain amendments, and Part II. corresponds in like manner to Torrens's Acts, and Part III. to Shaftesbury's Acts. The Bethnal Green Improvement Scheme, comprising some property in the Parish is being carried out by the County Council under Part I. of this Act, whilst the Moira Place and Plummer's Place area is being dealt with by the Vestry under Part II. There is little in the Act to show of what size or value an area should be in order to be treated by the County Council as a Metropolitan Improvement under Part I., except sec. 72, which provides that where an area only contains 10 houses, it cannot be so treated by tbe County Council. Several clauses have been inserted in the new Act providing safeguards against the payment of excessive compensation in respect of dwellings taken either for the above purposes or for the purposes of improvement schemes such as were formerly carried out under Cross's Acts, where dwellings have been allowed to get into a state of defective sanitation or into bad repair, or where their rentals have been enhanced by overcrowding, or by reason of the houses having been used for illegal purposes. Provision has also been made for diminishing the expenses of arbitrations, and exempting the local authorities from the payment of the expenses of owners in respect of arbitrations in cases where such particulars of claims have not been delivered prior to the appointment of the arbitrator, as would have enabled the local 14 authority to make proper offers of compensation: and for the protection of the interests of the inhabitants of insanitary houses and unhealthy areas, the Act has empowered Courts of summary jurisdiction, when making orders for the closing of houses unfit for human habitation, to authorize the payment to the tenants of a reasonable allowance on account of their expenses in removal, which will be recoverable from the owners of the houses; while it has also enabled the local authorities to make similar payments to the tenants of houses who are required to give up possession when the houses are to be pulled down for the purposes of improvement schemes. The above are some of the most important of the very numerous practical amendments of the law which have been made by Mr. Ritchie's Act, and which have been carefully designed with a view of strengthening the hands of the local authorities and infusing new life into enactments which have from one cause or another been allowed to remain for many years a dead letter. In most parts of the country the law on this subject is now for the first time readily accessible to the public, and the Act has placed it in the power of every sanitary authority and County Council in the country at a comparatively small cost to do something substantial towards improving the sanitary condition of the houses of the labouring classes. Experience has shown that in districts where the law relating to insanitary dwellings is properly enforced by a local authority, the resulting benefits are by no means confined to the individual cases in which proceedings are taken. The knowledge that the law is being enforced operates as a strong inducement to the owners of adjoining properties to carry out repairs and improvements which would not otherwise be undertaken. It is from this point of view that the provisions of the recent Act, which have so greatly facilitated the taking of proceedings against individual owners of insanitary dwellings, are especially valuable. ADVERTISEMENTS RATINGS ACT, 1890. By this Act advertising stations are made liable to assessment, the owner of the station who permits it to be used and receives the rent for its use as such being the proper person to be rated. FINANCES. The Abstract of the Vestry's Accounts for the past year appear in an improved form in this Report. Though the important changes effected in the staff of the Accountant's office will be recorded in next year's Report, having occurred after "Lady-day," 1891, it will not be out of- place here to refer to the appointment of the Vestry's new Accountant, Mr. E. A. R. Adams, as it is due to his industry that the Accounts are now published in their new form. The Vestry was fortunate in securing the services of an official who had been trained in the offices of the Sheffield Corporation whose accounts are admittedly kept on the best system and have served as a model for many other authorities. It is this system which Mr. Adams has applied to the publication of the present Accounts, and on which he is arranging to keep the books of the Vestry. The system consists in keeping all books by double entry, so that 15 every item is placed to a personal and impersonal account, and thus, in addition to the state of the account of every debtor and creditor of the Vestry being shown, the expenses under different headings, such as Town Hall Establishment, Highways and the like, are readily ascertainable. Not only is a record kept of the actual receipts and payments during the financial year, which is all that many Vestries attempt to do, but the income accrued due and the expenditure incurred for the year is also shewn. Without this it is impossible to ascertain whether the year's revenue of the Vestry has exceeded or been less than the year's expenditure. For instance, if a Precept of the Guardians for £5,000 becomes payable on the 20th March, and is not actually paid before the 25th March, any calculation of the year's expenses based on an account of receipts and payments only would be misleading to the extent of £5,000. So, on the other hand, if £5,000 of rates are outstanding on the 25th March, a similar misapprehension as to income during the year would take place, and when it is remembered that many of the receipts and payments in any year are in respect of the previous year's working, the difficulty of reckoning the results of a year's administration increases. No man of business can properly ascertain his year's profits or losses without keeping an account of income and expenditure in addition to actual receipts and payments, and it is a matter for surprise that none of the Metropolitan Vestries, nor even the London County Council, keep an account so essential to a clear apprehension of their position. It must be some months before the Vestry's old books can be properly closed and the new system put in thorough working order, and the change of system and working up arrears will throw a vast amount of detail work on the Accountant, but the Vestry will shortly be able to rest assured that their finances are recorded in a more perfect manner than those of any ether Metropolitan authority, and that their system of book-keeping leaves nothing to be desired. DUSTING AND SCAVENGING SCHEME. The Committee appointed to cai-ry out this work held 11 Meetings in the year, and made arrangements for securing a lease of De Beauvoir Wharf, Kingsland Road. The various steps to be taken in launching the scheme were also considered, but the very important transactions of the Committee for putting the work into execution, will be recorded together in next year's Report. MISCELLANEOUS RESOLUTIONS. Higham Park Purchase Scheme.—Epping Forest. It was Resolved on the 24th June, 1890 ''That this Vestry hereby offers to Sir T. F. Buxton, Bart., J.P., and Mr. E. N. Buxton, J.P., its hearty sympathy in their endeavour to bring the Scheme to a successful issue, and also takes this opportunity of thanking them for that liberality in the past by which the Forest area has been greatly enriched." 16 Contracts.—(Rates of Wages.)

LIGHTING DEPARTMENT. The Destrg of the Parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON. INSPECTOR DOUGHTY'S REPORT. Lighting- Department, 25th Mcircli, 1891. Gentlemen, I beg herewith to present the following report and tables showing the work done by this department, and the operation of the Average Meter System during the thirteenth year. The price of gas supplied to the public lamps during the year was 2/2 per 1,000 cubic feet. The cost of the work of the Vestry doing their own repairs, painting and glazing lamps, columns and brackets for the year, amounts to £186 16s. 6d. This is £17 13s. 10d. less than the amount that would have been paid had the work been done by contract at the last contract prices. I may venture to say that the work has been done with less delay and done better. The total amount paid for gas, lamplighters' wages, lighting, extinguishing and cleaning, materials and wages for repairs, painting, and maintenance of meters and governors for the year, including 255 improved lamps of increased illuminating power, fixed at refuges and positions where more light was required, is £5,583 5s. 8d., being £49 Is. 8d. more than last year. This is due to 12 additional lamps being fixed, and the increased time of burning during foggy weather. The average cost per ordinary lamp for the year was £2 17s. 5fd. 12 new ordinary lamps have been fixed and put in lighting during the year, 2 discontinued, 11 removed to more favourable positions, and 3 increased from 4-6 feet per hour to 8 feet per hour. The total number of lamps in use is 1658: 1403 of which are 14-inch ordinary lamps fitted with governors regulated to consume 4-6 feet per hour; 4 regulated to consume 6'9 per hour; 127 regulated to consume 8 feet per hour; 23 regulated to consume 12 feet per hour; 64, 18-inch Victoria lamps regulated to consume 15 feet per 94 hour; 3 regulated to consume 16 feet per hour; 1, 60-candle power lamp consuming 20 feet per hour; 4, 80-candle power lamps consuming 24 feet per hour; 3 consuming 30 feet per hour; 24, 100-candle power lamps consuming 33 feet per hour; 1,180-candle power lamp consuming 50 feet per hour; and 1, 200-candle power lamp consuming 58 feet per hour. The annual cost of gas, lighting and maintenance of 12 lamps under railway arches, and 3 in Great Eastern Street, amounting to £44 7s. 9d., has been paid by the North London Railway Company and the owners of three lamps in Great Eastern Street. The sum of £7 9s. Od. has been recovered from persons causing damage to lamps by driving against them, or by projections on their vehicles; £1 has been paid to the police and others for reporting particulars. During the months of October, December, January, February and March, lamps were lighted in the day-time for a period of 24 hours, on account of the foggy weather. Additional lamps have been fixed in the following streets during the year:— 1 in Bowl Court 1 ,, Clifton Street 4 ,, Curtain Road 1 ,, Dunloe Street 2 ,, Earl Street 2 ,, Finsbury Avenue 1 ,, Gifi'ord Street 12 Lamps have been discontinued in the following places during the year:— 1 in Goldsmith Square (place closed) 1 ,, Old Street, corner Wood Street (alterations) 2 In the following streets the positions of lamps have been re-arranged:— 1 in Bridport Place 1 ,, Charles Square 1 ,, City Road 3 ,, Curtain Road 1 ,, French Alley 1 ,, Mundy Street 2 ,, Old Street 1 ,, Paul Street 11 95 PUBLIC URINALS. The Public Urinals, 33 in number, were cleaned and painted in the summer by men employed for the purpose by the Vestry, the cost for labour, paint and too's amounted to £35 15s. 3d. The sum of £5 lis. Od. was paid for 48 feet one-inch new hose and six pairs of couplings for flushing Urinals. The sum of £22 4s. Od. was paid during the year for Plumber's work and repairs to Urinals. The amount paid to the Water Companies for water supplied to the Urinals, and rent of meters during the year was £320 10s. 5d., £5 5s. 3d. of which has been paid to the Vestry by the Kiosk Company, and £16 by the Vestry of St. Luke, as agreed, for water and maintenance of Urinal in Shepherdess Walk. The amount of £6 19s. 8d. has been paid to the East London Water Company for water and rent of meter supplied to the Mortuary. FLUSHING COURTS AND GULLIES. The cost of flushing courts and gullies with water direct from the mains through a 2^-inch hose, the East London Company's district being done in the day-time, and the New River Company's district in the night-time, was, for water, £203 6s. 4d., and £56 14s. Od. for labour, the amount paid for chloride of lime was £5 lis. 6d. The sum of £2 17s. 0d. was paid for repairs to hose.

Gentlemen, During the past year 4,461 births—2,238 males and 2,223 females—and 3,530 deaths were registered in this Parish. Deducting 479 deaths of non-residents, which occurred in Public Institutions and other places in the Parish, the (corrected) deathrate was 20.74 per 1,000 living.

There were 489 deaths from bronchitis, 270 from phthisis, and 285 from pneumonia, making a total of 1,000 deaths registered under the above headings as against 387 in the previous year; 775 deaths occurred under one year of age, against 705 in the previous year. The deaths under five years of age wore 1,897 against 1,076 in the previous year. 455 deaths occurred of persons 65 years of age and upwards, as against 400 in the previous year, viz., 275 from (55 to 75, 150 from 75 to 85, 29 from 85 to 95, and 1 at 95. In the previous year 225 persons died between 65 and 75 years of age, 151 from 75 to 85, and 24 from 85 to 95. In childhood (from 1 to 5 years) the largest number of deaths was caused by lung disease, comprising 200 from bronchitis, 165 from pneumonia, and 10 from congestion of the lungs, &c. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were atrophy and debility, 170 deaths, convulsions 91, whooping cough 115, premature birth 67, and diarrhoea 92. From the ago of 55 and upwards, 209 deaths were caused by bronchitis, 83 by heart disense, and 27 by paralysis; 97 were registered under the term of old age. ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 545 deaths, viz., 42 by scarlet fever, 21 by enteric, 58 by diphtheria, 127 by measles, 117 by whooping cough, 102 by diarrhoea, and 78 by other zymotic diseases. Of the 117 deaths from whooping cough, 48 occurred in infants under one year of age, and 10 in infants between one and two years of age. Of the 102 deaths from diarrhoea, 86 occurred in infants under two years of age.

IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON. INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. Sanitary Department, 25th March, 1891. Gentlemen, I beg to present the following report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendence during the year ended 25th March, 1891, showing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement. Notices were served requiring the abatement of nuisances in 1565 premises. WORKS DONE TO SECURE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.

During the months of June, July, August, September and October 4 tons of disinfectants were given away at the Town Hall to 8272 applicants. In addition to the ordinary notices served for the abatement of nuisances, 803 letters have been written. The following details are submitted, showing the general character of the work that has encaged attention during the past year. BOSTON STREET (28 houses.) (Nos. 12, 14, 16, 18, and Nos. 23 to 71.) These were four-roomed cottages—they were old and worn out structures. Originally they were built of the most inferior materials, and in the worst manner. The Leaseholder, under Sanitary Notices, had done much work from time to time, in order to keep the places fit for habitation, but the destructive habits of the miserably poor tenants operating on the decayed fabric of the dwellings, proved again and again that the money so spent was practically wasted, and that a thorough renovation of the premises was needful in the interests of all concerned. The Sanitary Committee being satisfied on those points, ordered notices to be served, specifying, in detail, the works necessary to renovation. It then appeared that the lease would expire in about three years, and it was urged on behalf of the leaseholder that the cost of the works would far exceed the returns from the property during that period, and under those circumstances the Committee consented to delay proceedings, in order to enable the leaseholder (a 114 widow lady) to negotiate the surrender of the lease, and, also, with a view to secure the demolition of the houses by the freeholder. The first notices were served in May, and the lease was surrendered at Christmas quarter. The freeholder thereon immediately commenced the demolition of the premises, and is now actively engaged in rebuilding good substantial four-roomed cottages, the whole of which will, probably, be completed this summer. The freeholder had previously rebuilt a considerable number of the adjoining houses ; there is, therefore, geod reason to believe that Boston Street, which has hitherto been one of the worst streets in the parish, both as to its houses and as to their tenants, will soon become greatly improved in both respects. BED LION STREET (12 houses.) Nos. 43 to 54. These were very old and worn out three-roomed cottages, the leases of which had reverted to the ground landlord a year or two back. The neglect of the landlord during that time had brought them into a condition quite unfit for habitation. An order thereon having been made to secure the closure of the premises was at once complied with; the owner then proceeded to demolish, and carted away the whole of the material of the twelve cottages, and has erected in their place twelve fourroomed cottages properly fitted with all necessary conveniences. These cottages, which are built neatly and substantially, command a new and a much more respectable class of tenants, who keep their houses in good order. The roadway having been asphalted by your Vestry contributes thereby to the general cleanliness of the street, the houses, and the people living in them. Hitherto, as children played in the unpaved and muddy street so there was mud in the houses. Now that the roadway is the cleanest of playgrounds, dirty houses are the exception. CAROLINE PLACE (34 houses). Nos. 1 to 34. These are two-roomed cottages, and formed a section of 1,068 premises complained of by the Mansion House Council—the complaint being, that the closets were without water supply. It would have been easy in the case of these premises, as in most of the other premises complained of, to have given satisfaction to the Mansion House Council by at once serving notices requiring the provision of water supply to all the closets, which would, probably, have been complied with in a few weeks; but in that manner of treatment it was felt the complaints of the Mansion House Council would become very mischievous, for their complaints being attended to, and by a Sanitary Inspector, would lead inexperienced persons to imagine that no sanitary defects remained in their houses. As to the 34 houses of Caroline Place, in instance, the only complaint received, was that the w.c.'s had no water, whereas a proper inspection found ample evidence of defective drains, defective yard paving, and defective construction of 115 w.c.'s, subsequently the ground being opened by the owner on request, the drains extending through the back yards and under two houses were found to be brick barrels of a uniform size of 18 inches. These barrel drains extended full size throughout their whole length and had very little fall, and were more than half filled up with fecal deposits. The whole of the drains and their contents were removed and their course purified, good pipe drains laid, the yards paved all over with good Portland cement concrete, properly shaped gullies provided under the draw taps in the yards, the closets fitted up "Shoreditch pattern" with concrete floors (open spaces under seats, seats hinged, and closets thus rendered available for urinals. These were the first houses inspected by the Royal Commission during the late enquiry, and . the Commissioners had the opportunity of seeing the improved conditions on the one side of the street, and the old foul conditions on the other in process of removal " HOME OFFICE ENQUIRY." Following upon the announcement by the Home Office of the appointment of two Commissioners to enquire into the sanitary condition of Shoreditch (in consequence of representations made to that department by "The Mansion House Council"), the Vestry sustained a great loss in the death of its principal officer, Mr. E. Walker, Vestry Clerk, and, following upon the enquiry held by the Commissioners, the Vestry sustained a further great loss in the lamented death of Dr. Henry Gawen Sutton, its Medical Officer of Health. Under these circumstances, and by instruction of the Vestry Clerk, it devolves upon me to submit a few observations upon the Enquiry and the report of the Commissioners. When it became evident to your Medical Officer and the Sanitary Committee that "The Mansion House Council" had determined to force the appointment of a Royal Commission, it was at once recognised that no good could accrue by attempting to deal with the insanitary condition of houses, on the line of the complaints of that body; and it was held, that though your Inspector could have given full satisfaction to "The Mansion House Council" by confining his attention to the items of the complaints of their Inspectors, that it was wiser and much more in the interest of public health that the ordinary and well considered practice of the Department should not be departed from, in consequence of the receipt of an extraordinary number of complaints, many of which were not of a serious nature, and which, with a very few exceptions, referred exclusively to surface conditions. Those complaints were, therefore, dealt with as circumstances permitted and in conjunction with the ordinary work and the ordinary practice of the Department— which requires the Sanitary Inspector to take cognisance of the evidence of defective underground conditions and all other injurious conditions, although the matter of complaint calling for his attention and visit may not be of a serious character; and at the Enquiry which was opened on the 12th November, 1890, that order of procedure 116 was fully and successfully upheld on behalf of the Vestry, by the Vestry's Counsel, Mr. E. Lewis Thomas. The total number of premises as to which complaints were received between the 27th March and August 26th, 1883, was 1,068. The total number of defects complained of in those houses numbered 1,948, and at the enquiry it was given in evidence that 803 of those premises had been dealt with. The separate items of "The Mansion House Councigl's" complaints numbered in those 803 premises 1,643, referring, generally, to defective dust bins, and to w.c.'s defectively supplied with water, or without water supply. In addition to dealing with those complaints, the great majority of the 803 premises were redrained wholly or partially. Rain pipes and waste pipes of kitchen sinks were disconnected from drains; yards paved and proper gullies provided therein; dust bins of the improved "Shoreditch pattern" provided; water closets reconstructed and fitted up on the "Shoreditch pattern; "broad concrete cills provided to front and back doors; eaves, gutters, and rain pipes wholly or partially reinstated, and internal repairs and cleansing of premises effected—amounting in all to 2,041 separate items in addition to the complaints of the Council, and in addition also to a very large amount of work done in houses not complained of. It will be evident from the foregoing statement, how misleading and how mischievous would have been the result if the complaints of "The Mansion House Council" had been permitted to disorder the ordinary course of procedure—which, in its working, is systematically and surely eradicating evils, and improving injurious conditions, which have been the product of ages of ignorance and carelessness, and which, it may be said, are in no wise at all peculiar to the houses of Shoreditch, as distinguished from the houses of the Metropolis generally. Referring to these matters, and dealing with the list of 532 defects reported as still existing in September, the Commissioners say:— "COMMISSIONERS' REPORT." (1.) Page 4. "We found 48 defects had been remedied, 47 were in course of "being remedied, and 44 other reported defects could be considered as of not "sufficient gravity to be injurious to health," (i.e., a deduction of 8 per cent. from the total of complaints). (2.) Page 4. They also bear testimony that action was not confined to houses reported by the Mansion House Council, (but that the Vestry) "had dealt "with the houses of whole streets, when but a few of the houses were the "subject of complaint." 117 (3.) Page 8. As to water supply. "The water supply is almost entirely by the "New River Company, and the service is constant. The action which the "Vestry took, at the instigation of its Medical Officer of Health, to secure for "the inhabitants a constant, in place of an intermittent, service, with its "numerous attendant evils, as set out in the Annual Reports, and as given in "evidence before us—is worthy of all praise. In the course of our inspection "we found the constant system universally in operation and hardly a storage "cistern was to be seen." Constant supply of Water. No Cisterns. (4.) Page 9. As to drainage, &c. "The proof of thoroughness in the execution "of the drainage work is the sustained satisfactory working of that which is "underground, and, consequently, out of sight. This part of the work, so far as "we have been able to judge, has been admirably executed. As regards the "sanitary surroundings and appurtenances of dwellings, evidence of good work "is also apparent, not only in the method of paving the yards, but in the " institution of a particularly cleanly pattern of water closet." Drainage. "The Shoreditch Watercloset." The Water Closet, commended by the Commissioners as "a particularly cleanly pattern of water closet," was introduced by your Inspector eighteen years ago, and closets of that pattern are now numbered in Shoreditch by thousands. They were introduced as a corrective to the foul and dangerous condition inseparable from closets of the ordinary form of construction, and during those years their advantages have been steadily pressed upon the attention of owners of property, their surveyors, and builders, in all cases where foul and dilapidated closets have been dealt with officially. The pattern is now adopted generally in Shoreditch ; is spreading into other districts ; and it has led to the general recognition that the space under and around a closet seat should be open, and as free to be cleaned as any other part of a house ; and it is reforming the whole previous conception of water closet fittings, as shown in the various forms of pedestal arrangements which within the last nine or ten years have followed upon its introduction.—See Plate appended, page 127. COMMISSIONERS' REPORT—continued. (5.) Page 7. "The Counsel for the Vestry laid stress on the fact that the death "rate for 1889 was as low as 19.1, contending that this was proof of the sanitary "condition of the parish being not unsatisfactory. We do not consider that "any such inference can be drawn from the death-rate of one year. At the "same time, we do attach importance to the fact, which we have carefully "verified, that the death-rate for the past four years has continuously declined "from 23.5 to 19.1, and this, we think, may be taken as satisfactory evidence that A falling Death-rate. 118 "the sanitary condition has been steadily and materially improved of late years. "Of similar significance is the fact that the deaths of infants under one year of "age have, during the four years, become reduced from 185 to 156 per 1,000 "births; and that with a, practically, stationary population, the deaths from "typhoid fever have fallen from 32 to 17. Thus, as a result of our investiga"tions, we find again, after excluding non-parishioners who died in public "institutions in Shoreditch, and including Shoreditch parishioners who died "in other institutions in other parishes, that the deaths recorded under the head "of typhoid fever have been:— Year 1886 32 deaths. „ 1887 25 ,, 1888 20 „ 1889 17 "And we further find that if the fever mortality be judged, not only by the "proportion of deaths per 1,000 of the population, but by the proportion fever "deaths bear to the whole number of deaths from all causes in each of the years "under notice, the fact as to the reduction of Shoreditch fever mortality is "equally striking." This is further evidenced by the figures given by the Commissioners, shewing the mortality from typhoid fever year by year in Sboreditch, as distinguished from all London, and they are tabulated for comparison as follows:— DEATHS FROM TYPHOID FEVER. Shoreditch. London. 1886 1 out of every 93 deaths. 1 out of every 134 deaths. 1887 Do. do. 118 Do. do. 138 „ 1888 Do. do. 136 Do. do. 118 „ 1889 Do. do. 144 Do. do. 143 „ COMMISSIONERS' REPORT—continued. Infectious Diseases ( Notification ) Act. (6.) Page 9. "The Infectious Disease (Notification) Act came into operation in "1889—its effect has been to throw a great deal of additional work upon the "sanitary staffs of the London vestries. We find that this Act has been "worked in Shoreditch efficiently and without friction." Disinfecting Chamber. (7.) "A disinfecting chamber with a hot-air stove has been provided for tlio "use of the parish." 119 (8.) "A public mortuary, to which bodies awaiting interment may be removed, Mortuary. "has been provided in this parish in a very convenient and suitable situation. "It was built in 1875, and rebuilt in 1887." It will be in the recollection of the Vestry that your late Medical Officer of Health held, that the great object of sanitary administration should be to educate and lead the people to a knowledge of the value of Sanitation, and that one good lesson was capable of producing much better results than many harsh and coercive proceedings. Working in that spirit, police court proceedings are rarely needed, much waste of time is thus avoided and bitterness of feeling also; and it was given in evidence to the Commissioners —as to the many hundreds of houses visited by them, the improvements in which they commend in their report—that it was not necessary to take out a summons in any one of those cases; nevertheless, it will be seen that the third recommendation of the Commissioner's Report is: "The more complete exercise of the powers of the Nuisance Removal and other Sanitary Acts by necessary magisterial proceedings." The late Medical Officer of Health on Sanitary Administration. No comment is offered on that recommendation, nor on the other facts adduced (which would require the weight and authority of your Medical Officer of Health to enforce), further than the observation, that with a remarkably declining death rate, and with a diminution of deaths from typhoid in four years from 1 in 93 to 1 in 144, while London, as a whole, remained almost stationary, and with the testimony of the Commissioners to the value of the work which has been done, it may very well be questioned (to say the least), if there is any district in London that could have come out of such an enquiry with greater credit than the Parish of Shoreditch. The following notes of the opening address of Mr. E. Lewis Thomas, M.A., Vestry's Counsel, will, no doubt, be found of historical value and interest. COUNSEL'S SPEECH. Mr. Thomas said: "For many years a steady, energetic, and persistent work of Sanitary Improvement has been carried on in Shoreditch, in the provision of new sewers, the opening up of new streets and the widening and improvement of other streets, and the removal of large numbers of old, ruinous, and badly constructed houses. In the introduction of the constant water supply (so far back as 1877, the parish being the first in the Metropolis to secure that advantage to its inhabitants), and in the thorough rectification of the drains, the paving and drainage of the yards and forecourts. The improvement and remodelling of the water-closets, the construction of improved dust bins, and the general repairing of roofs, walls, ceilings, &c., of the dwellings in the parish. These works may be dealt with in the order in which they have been referred to. K 120 New Sewers. "It is found by a statement, supplied by the Vestry's Surveyor, that 7,544½ lineal feet of new sewer has been constructed during the last ten years, and at a total cost of £2,887; and that 1,254 private drains have been constructed or re-constructed into sewers at a total cost of £2,484. New Streets, "The construction of New Streets includes Great Eastern Street, the western end of Bethnal Green Road, Chatham Avenue, and Appold Street. "The Streets Widened and Improved include High Street, the south end of Hackney Road, Harwar Street, Nile Street, and Huntingdon Street. "In carrying out these improvements, large numbers of old and dilapidated houses were swept away. Willow Walk, Long Alley, and a large number of adjacent courts and alleys, with all their ruinous tenements, have entirely disappeared. Report of the Medical Officer of Health on the Finsbury Estate of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners "A large number of the houses referred to stood upon the Finsbury estate of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and how that body studied the financial advantages opened up to them by the public spirited efforts of the Vestry, and set at nought sanitary considerations, may be gathered from the special report of Dr. Sutton, the Medical Officer of Health, presented to the Vestry in 1871, upon the condition of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners' Estate situate in Shoreditch. Metropolitan Board of Works and Cross's Act. "The Vestry has not been remiss in using the powers given to it by the Legislature. In October, 1876, the Medical Officer reported the houses of Cotton Gardens, Hackney Road, and Hudson's Court, Kingsland Road—under Cross's Act—to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and not until three years afterwards was a reply received from that Board stating that it was an area they could not deal with. Torren's Act and the Court of Quarter Sessions re Aim's Place. "Torren's Act was applied in 1876 in condemnation of Ann's Place, 11 houses, all in the most insanitary condition). Against the Vestry's order to demolish the houses, the owner appealed to the Quarter Sessions, with the result that the premises were visited by the Bench of Magistrates, and, though it was shown that several houses were traversed by a disused sewer within 18 inches of the floors, and others of the houses were built on the edge of another section of the sewer into which they were evidently settling, and though the roofs, walls, ceilings, floors, doors, sashes, and all internal fittings were worn out and dilapidated, nevertheless the Bench gave the owner (a wealthy man) the privilege of repairing the tenements, and decided that each party should bear their own costs, which in the case of the Vestry amounted to £537. Metropolitan Board of Works and Cross's Act,re Ann's riace. "In October, 1882, the houses being again let, and still in an evil plight, the Medical Officer reported them, under Cross's Act, to the Metropolitan Board of Works as being unfit for habitation, including in his report five houses in Boundary Street, nine houses in Jane Shore Court, and one in High Street. 121 "In reply a letter was received on the 31st October, 1883, stating that the Board was of opinion that the area was too limited to come within the scope of the Act of 1875, and the letter proceeded— " 'It seems to the Board that an unhealthy area of this small extent 'should be dealt with by the Vestry, under the Act of 1868 and that 'which subsequently amended it (known together as Torren's Acts) 'or by some other means, and that the area should not have been 'made the subject of a representation to this Board under the Artizans' 'and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875.' "This was to be regretted, as it was hoped an improvement scheme would have opened up a roadway from High Street to Boundary Street, in relief of the congested district of Bethnal Green, now occupying the attention of the London County Council. "On the 30th July, following the despatch of the report on Ann's Place and Jane Shore Court, the Medical Officer of Health reported some other areas to the Metropolitan Board of Works, viz., 35 houses in Watson's Place, 40 in Ware Street, 15 in Louisa Street, 8 in Nancy Street, 21 in Moira Place, and 21 in Reform Place—total number of houses 140 ; and a reply was received stating that the Board could not entertain any other schemes in addition to those they already had in hand. Metropolitan Board of Works and Cross's Act, re Ware Street, Watson's Place Moira Place, &c. "Following upon that, the 21 houses in Reform Place have been demolished under sanitary notices, and upon the site Baths and Wash-houses have been built; 6 of the houses in Jane Shore Court have been taken down and the site built upon for warehouse purposes. The houses of Ware Street, Watson's Place, Nancy Street, and Louisa Street have been repaired again and again, but they are so badly constructed and built of such inferior materials, that they must produce frequently recurring nuisances. These facts were urged upon the attention of the London County Council in letters addressed to the Council by the Medical Officer on the 13th May, 1889, and the 6th May, 1890. It was also urged that an Improvement Scheme would afford an opportunity for the erection of improved dwellings—which are much wanted in that locality —and that the open spaces and the other dilapidated houses and sheds lying between the area and Hoxton Street could be included by the Council under the 5tli Section of the Act of 1875, and, by such means, a large Improvement Scheme be effected with great advantage. Nevertheless, the Council have decided not to apply Cross's Act to that area. The London County Council and Cross's Act, re Ware Street, Watson Place, &c. "The Council, having also declined to act upon the report of the Medical Officer, addressed to the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1883, in reference to Plumber's Place and Moira Place, and, nine years having elapsed, it was found that the neighbourhood called for a large and comprehensive Improve- "London County Council" and Cross's Act, re Plumber's Place, &c. M 1 122 merit Scheme; the Medical Officer, therefore, transmitted a report to the London County Council, under Cross's Act, referring to 11 houses in East Road, 13 houses in Nile Street, 17 houses in Custance Street, 11 houses in Moneyer Street, 7 houses in Plumber's Place, 28 houses in Provost Street, 5 houses in Ebenezer Street, 21 houses in Moira Place, and 11 houses in Britannia Street —a total of 117 houses. "London County Councils" appeal to the Home Secretary. "On receipt of these reports, the London County Council appealed to the Home Secretary, under Section 5 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, the result being the appointment of an Arbitrator, who held a court of enquiry in Shoreditch Town Hall to enable him to advise the Home Secretary upon the nature of the improvement required, and whether it should be effected by the London County Council, under Cross's Act, or by the Vestry, under Torren's Act, the result being that the Home Secretary decided to the effect "that the case was of general importance to the County of London, and that it should be dealt with under Part 2 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and that the London County Council should contribute one-half of the expense. "London County Council " and Cross's Act, re Vinegar Ground, &c. "On June 26th, 1889, the Medical Officer also reported, under Cross's Act, 7 houses in Staff Street, 12 houses in Henrietta Street, 12 houses in Vincent Street, 4 houses in Wilson Street, 4 houses in Catherine Street, being a total of 39 houses, all in the Vinegar Ground. In another area, 15 houses in Bath Court, 2 houses in Bath Place, 9 houses in Rivington Street, and 3 houses in Old Street, being a total in this area of 29 houses; and in another area, Essex Place, Hackney Road, 21 houses. "The condition of the houses, is this: they are old, dilapidated, worn out structures held on leases, which makes renovation impossible, and many of them are so closely packed together that they cannot be effectually dealt with under the Nuisance Removal or Torren's Acts, but require re-arrangement under Improvement Schemes, and the Vestry at the present time await the result of the Reports of the Medical Officer to the London County Council. The provision of Constant Water Supply. "The history of the proceedings in connection with the provision of the Constant Water Supply show the persistent determination brought to bear upon the companies to secure that boon to the rate-payers. "In January, 1874, the Medical Officer of Health applied to the New River Company, on behalf of the Vestry, for the provision of a constant water supply 123 in Shoreditch. On the 27th January, a reply was received stating that the Company preferred that the Local Authority rather than the Company should take the initiative in the matter. "In October, 1875, the Vestry addressed a letter to the Metropolitan Board of Works requesting it to employ its authority to require the Water Company to furnish a constant supply to a section of the parish. To this the Metropolitan Board of Works replied: 'They were of opinion it was not expedient to comply with the request.' The Metropolitan Board of Works on Constant Water Supply. "In the month of February, 1877, a deputation, consisting of the Medical Officer, the Vestry Clerk, and the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, waited upon the Directors of the New River Company, to request them to furnish a constant supply to a considerable portion of the District, but the Directors declined to do so unless required by the Metropolitan Authority. "Under these circumstances the Vestry applied to the Local Government Board in April 1877, with the result that the New River Company laid on the constant supply throughout the whole of the area in Shoreditch. "This has enabled the Sanitary Inspector to secure the removal of 2,966 cisterns, so situated as to be dangerous, and by the end of 1885, all waterbutts had disappeared from the parish ; 314 having gone under sanitary notice. Cisterns and Water Butts abolished. "It may also be mentioned that from a survey of the Annual Reports of the Medical Officers and the Sanitary Inspector, that a very large amount of work has been done, though it has been impossible for those Officers to remedy all the defects arising from original bad construction, cummon to so many of the small houses in the parish—to wit, soft, inferior bricks, mortar with little lime and no sand, sashes, doors, floors, and stairs of the flimsiest character, with rooms so small as not to give elbow room to families. "An immense amount of energy has been devoted, and very successfully, to the removal of the hidden dangers lying under houses and water-closets and adjacent yards, and in promoting dryness in walls by paving of yards, areas, and forecourts. Thus, from a summary of the reports of the last ten years, it will be found that 828 defective brick drains have been removed and pipe drains substituted, 4,052 defectively constructed pipe drains have been reconstructed, and 170 new drains have been laid down, 204 cesspools have been removed with their poisonous contents from the neighbourhood of houses, 2,891 waste pipes of kitchen sinks have been disconnected from drains, and 4,005 rain pipes, having their heads in dangerous proximity to bedroom windows, have been disconnected from drains, 5,893 water-closets have been reconstructed —each closet having been fitted up with a concrete floor and with an open space under the seat and around the pan, a plan introduced by the Chief Inspector of this parish, and which precludes the hidden accumulation of filth common to the ordinary construction of water-closets, 259 water-closets have Summary of Work Done in the last Te n Years. 124 been removed from dark and otherwise unsuitable places into the open-air, 62 have had their ventilation improved, and 6,982 have had water laid on. 5,744 yards and 612 areas and forecourts have been paved with concrete in promotion of dry walls, 1,201 sculleries or wash-houses have also been paved with concrete, 4,339 dust bins of improved construction (also introduced by the Chief Inspector) have been built, 1,320 roofs have been repaired, also 883 stairs, 703 sashes, 323 jambs and hearth stones, 934 floors, and 153 floors laid on the earth have been reconstructed with ventilation under, 2,607 cisterns, and 137 butts have been removed and water given direct from the main, and 274 water supplies been restored after being cut off for various reasons by water companies, 431 leaking water pipes have been repaired or reinstated, 736 defective rain pipes and 806 defective eaves gutters have been replaced with new ones. Not to attempt to mention a multitude of minor matters this list may fitly conclude with 143 houses closed as being unfit for habitation. "Though it is evident an enormous amount of solid beneficial work has been done, the character of which is exercising a wide-spread beneficial influence, not only in Shoreditch but also in other districts, it must frankly be admitted there remains a good deal to be done, to cope with which, the sanitary staff were insufficient in numbers. The Medical Officer, therefore, recognising the increased labour devolved upon the staff by the Notification of Infectious Diseases Act, recommended the Vestry, on December 12th, 1889, to appoint another Assistant Inspector, and this recommendation was adopted by the Vestry on the 29th July, 1890. "The introduction of the Notification Act in November of last year, interfered with and put a stop to the rectification of the defects in houses, complained of by "The Mansion House Council," and to the ordinary house to house work, but on the appointment of the new Assistant in August, energetic action was again resumed."

Fines were inflicted amounting to £63 5s. 6d. in 19 cases. SCAVENGING AND DUSTING. It was necessary repeatedly to report to your Vestry that the Contractor for the Eastern Division was unable or unwilling to carry out the terms of his Contract—he was, therefore, fined £26 10s., being 10s. for each of 53 cases of neglect. This appeared to produce no effect, the Vestry, therefore, imposed a further fine of £200, being £5 for each of 40 cases of neglect to remove house refuse. Following thereon it became necessary to employ vans and labour to remove snow and mud from roadways, and, finally, to cancel the Contract. The total deductions for fines and cost of work done amounted to £583 12s. 6d. 120 It was necessary, also, repeatedly to report that the Contractor for the North Western Division wan not properly carrying out the terms of his Contract. He was, therefore, lined £100, being £5 for each of 20 cases of neglect. It also became necessary to employ vans and labour to remove snow and mud from roadways at a cost of £40 7s. 10½d. These measures had the desired effect for the remainder of the term of Contract. In the South Western Division the work was done satisfactorily. REMOVAL OF DUST.
