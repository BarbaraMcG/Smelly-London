Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg herewith to present to you a report upon the health and sanitary conditions of the Borough for the year 1951. Dr. G. Macdonald retired from the position of Medical Officer of Health on the 31st May, 1951, when Dr. A. G. G. Thompson, Medical Officer of Health of Lambeth, took over in a temporary part-time capacity the duties of Medical Officer of Health pending the appointment of a permanent successor. Dr. Anderson Garland was appointed Deputy Medical Officer of Health and commenced duty on the 8th October, 1951, and on 20th October Dr. Thompson relinquished his temporary appointment, from which date Dr. Garland acted as Medical Officer of Health until January 7th, 1952, when I took up my present appointment. It falls to me, therefore, to make this report for a period prior to my taking up office and under the circumstances I thought it desirable that the report should be made a factual one with a minimum of comment. It is, however, right and proper that reference should be made to the long and loyal service which Dr. Macdonald rendered to the Council. It will be recalled that he was appointed Medical Officer to the Battersea Tuberculosis Dispensary, in 1919, at a time when it was run on a voluntary basis. In May, 1921, when the Dispensary was taken over by the Council Dr. Macdonald became a temporary officer and his appointment as permanent whole-time Tuberculosis Officer followed in July, 1921. In November, 1930, Dr. Macdonald was appointed Deputy Medical Officer of Health and when, in June, 1934, Dr. Lennane retired, Dr. Macdonald was appointed to succeed him as Medical Officer of Health, and held the office until he retired in May of last year, Dr. Macdonald, therefore, had over thirty years service with the Council. Although I myself have not had the privilege of his personal acquaintance, I knew of him by reputation as a wellknown Medical Officer of Health in the London area. I am sure it would be the wish of the Council that the hope should be expressed in this report that he will have many years of happy and pleasant retirement. Although, as I have said, the report this year is almost entirely factual, I have studied the figures and the statistics and I do not find anything of particular importance which merits special mention. The year appears to have been uneventful so far as epidemic diseases were concerned and the vital statistics show a satisfactory state of the public health. I should, however, like to direct your attention to the reference made in the body of the report to the Festival Pleasure Gardens situated within the Borough, particularly the excellent work done by the staff of the 5 Department in advising upon, and supervising, the catering and feeding arrangements in the Gardens. It was a very large task and some measure of its efficiency and success is given by the fact that in spite of the large numbers of meals and snacks partaken of, no case of food poisoning came to notice. This, I think, reflects the greatest credit both on the caterers themselves and also on the staff of the Department. There was a period of some months from the time Dr. Macdonald retired and I took up my duties, during which Dr. Thompson, of Lambeth, was in charge, and latterly Dr. Garland. The fact that when I took over I found a smoothly running Department is due (if it is not presumptuous to say so) in no small measure to the efficiency with which Dr. Thompson, and then Dr. Garland, maintained the high standard set by Dr. Macdonald, assisted very ably and loyally by all the members of the staff, in particular the Chief Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Chuter, and the Senior Clerk, Mr. Halstead. The Council will, I know, wish me to express thanks and appreciation to Dr. Thompson and Dr. Garland and to the staff of the Department for their services during this period. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. TUDOR LEWIS, Medical Officer of Health. August, 1952. Principal Figures for 1951. Ar ea of Borough, excluding tidal water (acres) 2,163 Home population (1951 Census—Provisional) 117,130 Home population (Registrar-General's Mid-Year Estimate 117,000 Structually separate occupied dwellings 27,480 Rateable va1ue—£995,991. * Sum produced by 1d. rate £4,114 Bi rths (live, 1,886 still, 37) 1,923 Live birth rate 16.12 Deaths— 1,456. Death rate 12.44 Maternal deaths—Nil. Maternal death rate - Infant deaths—52. Infant mortality rate 27.57 * At 31st March, 1952, 6 Vital Statistics. The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year home population of Battersea was 117,000, which shows a decrease of 700 on the comparable figure for 1950 (viz. 117,700). The population of the Borough as estimated in the Registrar- General's preliminary report of the census taken in April, 1951, was 117,130 (54,885 males and 62,245 females, a proportion of 100 males to 113 females). This figure shows a decrease of 42,422 (or 26.6 per cent.) on the population at the previous census taken in April, 1931, when it was estimated as 159,552 (75,506 males and 84,046 females). The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year home population of the Borough (117,000) has been adopted for the purpose of the statistics contained in this report. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered in the Borough during 1951 was 1,637 (866 male, 771 female). Of this number 710 were transferred out, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough, and 959 registered outside the Borough were transferred in, giving on balance a total of 1,886 births (970 male, 916 female, an excess of 54 males) relating to Battersea residents, and a live birth rate of 16.12 per 1,000 of the population. This is a decrease of 0.01 on that of 1950. Of the Battersea births (927 live and 18 still) which occurred within the Borough, 568 were “domiciliary births.” Illegitimate births numbered 117 or 7.1 per cent, of the live births. The live birth rate was 17.8 for the County of London, and 15.5 for England and Wales. Still-Births. The registration of still-births is made compulsory by the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1926. During 1951 there were 49 still-births registered in Battersea, of which 18 were of Battersea parents. 19 still-births occurring outside the Borough were registered as belonging to Battersea, making 37 in all, representing a still-birth rate of 19.24 per 1,000 births (live and still) registered. Of the 37 still-births 5 (13.5 per cent.) were registered as illegitimate. The number of Battersea still-births registered, and the stillbirth rates from 1942 to 1951 were as under: — No. Rate No. Rate 1942 43 26.7 1948 46 20.1 1943 36 21.6 1949 43 20.8 1944 40 24.0 1950 53 27.2 1945 38 23.3 1951 37 19.2 1946 59 22.7 Mean 1947 74 27.0 1942-51 47 23.3 7 Notification of Births. During 1951 the number of notifications of live births received belonging to the Borough was 1,784. The corrected number of Battersea births registered during the year was 1,886. The proportion of notified to registered births was, therefore, 94.6 per cent. Thirty-seven still-births were notified under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, during the year, the number notified being 100.0 per cent, of the total Battersea still-births registered. The homes from which births are notified are visited and revisited by Health Visitors. MARRIAGES. The marriages registered in Battersea during 1951 numbered 929. The marriage rate (i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 of the population) was 15.9. Year. Marriage Rate Marriages. 1,043 1946 19.2 1947 1,085 18.9 17.0 988 1948 17.2 1949 1,031 949 1950 16.1 Mean 1946-50 17.7 1,016 15.9 1951 929 DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in the Borough during 1951 was 1,995. Of these, 1,054 were deaths of non-residents and were transferred to the districts in which the persons ordinarily resided. There were, on the other hand, 515 deaths of Battersea residents registered outside the Borough. The total (corrected) number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 1,456 (males 719, females 737). This gives a recorded death rate of 12.44 compared with 13.1 for London, and 12.5 for England and Wales. The following table shows the age and sex distribution of the total deaths (corrected) in Battersea during 1951. — 1— Under 1 year. 5— 15— 25— 45— 65— 75+ Total 33 4 2 7 42 180 221 230 719 M. 5 F. 19 1 6 37 139 189 341 737 Totals 52 9 3 13 79 319 410 571 1,456 % of Total 0.2 3.6 0.6 0.9 5.5 21.9 28.1 39.2 100.0 Of the 1,456 Battersea deaths, 815 (or 56.0 per cent.) occurred in hospitals, etc. It is well known that in almost all districts the average age at death tends to increase. The position of Battersea in this respect is illustrated by the following figures : — Average Age at Death. Mean, 1940/1944 60.9 1945 62.4 1946 61.4 1947 62.6 1948 63.3 1949 65.3 Mean, 1945/1949 63.0 1950 65.5 1951 66.7 The deaths of 981 residents of Battersea aged 65 years and upwards were registered during 1951. These 981 deaths constituted 67.3 per cent. of the total deaths at all ages. The natural increase of population (that is, excess of births over deaths) was 430 in 1951 as compared with 580 in 1950. The causes of the 1,456 deaths in 1951 classified in various age groups, are shown in the following tables. 9 Causes of Death at Different Periods of Life in Battersea during 1951 The following table is supplied by the Registrar-General:- Causes of Death.

The corresponding death rate of legitimate children in 1951 was 26.57, the ratio of mortality rate of illegitimate infants to that of legitimate being 161 to 100. The corresponding figure for 1950 was 155 to 100. Maternal Mortality. During 1951 there were no deaths of women from pregnancy, childbirth, or abortion.

There was an increase in the number of notifications received during 1951, there being 3,476 during the year as compared with 1,037 in 1950. The increase was due mainly to an outbreak of measles, notifications of which numbered 2,664, an increase of 2,433 on 1950, in which year only 231 cases were notified. Six cases of polio-myelitis were notified, but in four of these cases the diagnosis was not confirmed, leaving two confirmed cases (one paralytic and one non-paralytic) both occurring in children under 10 years of age. There was only one case of diphtheria in the Borough during 1951. 13 Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation, Smallpox Vaccination. Diphtheria and Whooping Cough immunisation, and vaccination against Smallpox were carried out throughout the year at Southlands, under the control of the London County Council.

During the year 1951 there were 162 cases of Tuberculosis (all forms) notified in Battersea as compared with 149 in 1950, 194 in 1949, 213 in 1948, 162 in 1947 and 228 in 1946. In addition 69 cases were reported or otherwise came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, making a total of 231 cases for the year. The case rate per 100,000 population was 197.4. The tables on page 17 give details in age groups of the 231 cases. Deaths from Tuberculosis. During 1951 deaths from Tuberculosis registered as belonging to the Borough of Battersea numbered 50 of which 46 (i.e., 92.0 per cent.) were due to pulmonary tuberculosis, 4 (i.e., 8.0 per cent.) to other forms of the disease. The death rate per 100,000 of the population during the 50 years e nded 1950 in quinquennial averages and the year 1951 are given in the following table: — Years Pulmonary Non- Pulmonary Total 189.0 1901-1905 138.1 50.9 172.7 1906-1910 126.8 45.9 1911-1915 124.2 158.0 33.8 164.8 1916-1920 134.8 30.0 1921-1925 23.0 115.6 92.6 105.3 91.1 14.2 1926-1930 96.2 81.8 1931-1935 14.4 85.3 1936-1940 76.1 9.2 102.8 1941-1945 91.8 11.0 53.1 1946-1950 6.1 59.2 124.9 101.0 23.9 Average (50 years) 3.4 42.7 1951 39.3 The death rate per 100,000 population was 31 for England and Wales, and 38 for the County of London.

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. The bacteriological examination of clinical material (with the exception of specimens of sputum, which are dealt with at the Chest Clinic) is carried out by the Clinical Research Association, of Watergate House, Strand. During 1951 the number of bacteriological examinations of specimens sent in by medical practitioners practising in Battersea was 107 (exclusive of the specimens dealt with at the Chest Clinic). The following table gives particulars of the bacteriological examinations carried out during the year:— Suspected disease Positive Results Negative Results Total 106 1 Diphtheria Other 1 1 105 - 2 105 107 Total The cost of these examinations is borne by the Council, and in 1951 amounted to £17 5s. 3d. 19 Sanitary Circumstances. The following table sets out in summarised form the details of the main work of the Department in relation to sanitation:- Summary of Main Operations for the Year 1951. Sanitary Operations.

Inspections— Inspections—contd. Shops 38 Smoke observations 179 do. (Pharmacy Act) 36 Intimation notices served 44 Factories 1,954 Outworkers 1,262 Statutory notices served 2 20 Legal Proceedings. During the year, legal proceedings were taken by the Council in 228 cases, for the enforcement of various Acts, by-laws, regulations, etc., administered by the Health Department. A summary is set out below, and further details will be found in the sections dealing with the respective matters. Public Health (London) Act, 1936 215 Food and Drugs Act, 1938 ... 10 National Assistance Act, 1948 (Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons) 3 228 Fines totalling £26 0s. 0d. were imposed in connection with these proceedings, and £123 18s. costs were awarded to the Council. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions of this Act in regard to Nuisances continued to afford the main means whereby the remedy of insanitary conditions found in dwelling houses could be secured. During the year, 3,063 Intimation, and 1,694 Statutory (Nuisance) Notices were served. The high proportion of Statutory to Intimation Notices shows the continuing difficulty, referred to in previous reports, of securing the remedy of these conditions. Furthermore, legal proceedings to enforce compliance with Statutory Notices had to be taken in no less than 201 cases. Of these, 79 resulted in Nuisance Orders being made by the Court. The remaining 122 summonses were either adjourned or withdrawn, as the work required to comply with the Notices was either in hand, or had been completed, before the hearing. In 32 cases action to enforce compliance with Nuisance Orders had to be taken. In 31 of these, the Council carried out the work in default of the persons on whom the Orders were made. In those cases, the Council were entitled to recover the cost of the works from those persons, and accounts were accordingly rendered to them. Most of these accounts had been settled by the end of the year, but in 12 instances proceedings for the recovery of the cost had to be taken. Judgments for the amounts claimed were obtained in 11 cases. In the remaining case the amount claimed was paid before the summons was heard, and it was therefore not proceeded with. In one case, the Council elected to take proceedings for the noncompliance, and the case stood adjourned at the end of the year. One application was made to the Court for a warrant to enter a house for the purpose of making an inspection, the Sanitary Inspector having previously been refused admission. The warrant was granted and duly executed. Dustbins. Under Section 105 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, if any house is found to be without a proper dustbin, the Council may serve notice on the owner or occupier requiring provision to be made. 21 The same Section provided that any person aggrieved may appeal to the London County Council, but under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1951, which came into operation on the 1st August, 1951, this appeal was transferred to a court of summary jurisdiction. Similar provisions are contained in the Public Health Act, 1936, which applies to England and Wales outside the administrative County of London. Under that Act, however, right of appeal had always been to a court of summary jurisdiction. In the last few years, a number of such appeals have been made, some of them being subsequently taken to the Divisional Court. As a result, the principle has been established that, in deciding whether notice should be served on the owner or on the occupier, the local authority must consider all the circumstances of the individual case. It had previously been the practice of the Council, save in very exceptional circumstances, to regard the provision of dustbin accommodation as a matter for the owner, and accordingly to serve notice on him. In view, however, of the situation created by the various appeals referred to above, the Health Committee decided in 1949 that in future the circumstances of each case (e.g., net rent of house, number of tenants, existence of any tenancy agreement, financial circumstances of the occupier, etc.) should be submitted to them for their decision as to whether the notice is to be served on the owner or occupier. It should, however, be made clear that whatever the Committee may decide, the person served with a notice still has his right of appeal to the court. During the year, 11 such cases were considered by the Committee. In 8 of them it was decided to serve the notice on the owner, and in the remaining 3 on the occupier. In no case was an a ppeal lodged. Common Lodging Houses. There are no Common Lodging Houses or Seamen s Lodging Houses in the Borough. Public Lavatory Accommodation, Five public conveniences for both sexes and one for females only are provided by the Council in various parts of the Borough, two being underground. In addition to the usual lavatory accommodation (at least one free water-closet being provided for each sex) facilities for washing are also provided. Three public urinals are also maintained. In addition, the urinals attached to nine licensed premises are, b y arrangement with the owners, available to the general public, one additional such urinal having been made available during the year 1951. The Council at their meeting on the 31st January, 1951, decided, on the recommendation of the Health Committee, to Provide, in the interests of public health, free washing facilities a t each of the public conveniences in the Borough. 22 Drainage Work. The by-laws made by the London County Council under the Metropolis Management Acts with regard to drainage, and also those under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, relating to waterclosets, etc., are enforced by the Council. During the year new drains were constructed to 117 new buildings, and the drains of 16 old buildings were partially or entirely reconstructed under the supervision of the Officers of the Health Department. 79 plans of proposed drainage work were deposited in 1951, as compared with 107 in 1950. During the year drains were tested by smoke on 94 occasions and 33 were found defective. The water test was applied on 844 occasions, this being mainly to drains in course of construction. The frontage drains of 14 premises were constructed or reconstructed. In 2 cases, the Council carried out drainage works in default of compliance by the owners with the requirements of notices served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the cost being recovered from the respective owners. No legal proceedings for offences against the Drainage Bylaws were taken, but cautionary letters were sent in respect of two cases of failure to give notice of commencement of drainage works. Under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1951, which came into operation on the 1st August, 1951, appeals against acts and decisions of sanitary authorities in regard to drainage and water closets, which formerly had to be made to the London County Council, now have to be made to a court of summary jurisdiction. No such appeal was made during the year. Combined Drainage. Claims were made by the owners of two blocks of houses drained by combined operations that the combined portions of the drainage systems were "sewers" repairable by the Council. In both cases the claim was admitted and the necessary repairs to the combined drains were carried out by the Council. The Council also had to carry out further work to a combined drain liability for which had been previously admitted. Smoke Nuisances. During the year a number of complaints were made, alleging nuisances from smoke, dust, grit, etc., emitted from premises occupied by various industrial and public utility undertakings in the Borough. All such complaints were carefully investigated. The most serious and persistent source of dust and grit emissions has again been a large gas works. This has been referred to in previous Annual Reports and is due principally to the operation of plant of an obsolete type, replacement of which does not seem likely to take place for a number of years. Some trouble was also experienced from ash emitted from the chimneys of an electricity generating station. This was 23 found to be a consequence of extensive works which were being carried out to the flue gas washing plant and to the linings of the chimneys. Apart from these two instances, the complaints related to emissions from various industrial plants. On investigation, they were found to be due to some transient cause such as the use of unsuitable fuel, or temporary breakdown, of some part of the plant. In one case intimation and statutory notices were served, on which the nuisance was abated, and no further action was found necessary. The total number of observations made was 179. Effluvium Nuisances. A small number of complaints alleging nuisance from effluvia emitted from various industrial and business premises were received. In no case was the emission serious, and all were successfully dealt with by informal action. Of much more serious import Were emissions of sewer gas from the surface vents to one of the London County Council's main sewers, which passes through York Road, Battersea Park Road and Nine Elms Lane. These emissions had, in previous years, been the subject of sporadic complaints, especially during the summer months. In 1951, however, the London County Council enlarged all the vents, with the result that the emissions became far more extensive, producing a spate of Quite justifiable complaints from local residents and shopkeepers. The matter was before the Health Committee on several occasions, and as a result of their representations to the London County Council, all the vents were sealed, pending the outcome of investigations which, it was understood, were being made into alternative methods of ventilating sewers in general. Offensive Trades. There are two premises in the Borough at which scheduled offensive trades are carried on. These businesses have been established for many years and are satisfactorily conducted. Water Supply. During the year certificates under Section 95 (2) of the Public health (London) Act, 1936, were issued in respect of 117 new or r e-erected dwelling houses or tenements. In 14 houses an additional water supply on an upper floor was Provided, in compliance with notices served under Section 95 (5) of the Act. Thirty-three notices of waste of water from defective fittings, etc ., observed during routine inspections of various premises, were Se nt to the Metropolitan Water Board. At the public baths in Latchmere Road there are deep wells which supply water, not only to the Baths Establishments, but also, for all domestic purposes, to over 360 tenements on the council's Latchmere Estate. Formerly, supplies were adequate for all these purposes, but of recent years the yield from the wells has fallen, so that supplies from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board had to be drawn upon to an increasing extent, During 1950, the existing air-lift pumps on two of the borings 24 were replaced by electrically operated submersible pumps of modern design, with the result that the yield from these borings is now sufficient for normal requirements, the mains being drawn upon only in emergency. The water is chlorinated, as a safety measure, before passing into supply. A sample of the chlorinated water is taken every fortnight, and in addition, every three months a sample is taken from the rising main of each borehole (i.e., before chlorination). These samples are submitted, for bacteriological examination, to the Public Analyst, whose reports show that the water consistently maintains a high degree of purity. Rag and Bone Dealers. Premises occupied by rag and bone dealers in the Borough are subjected to regular inspection. During the year 119 inspections were made. Various small irregularities found to exist were brought to the notice of the occupiers of the premises and were remedied without recourse to formal action. Fouling of Footpaths by Dogs. No breach of the Council's by-law relating to this matter was reported during the year. Verminous Premises. During the year 236 premises, including 18 flats or houses on the Council's estates, which were found to be infested with vermin (principally bed-bugs) were disinfested. The usual method of treatment is by a D.D.T./pyrethrum spray. Van Dwellings. There are three sites in the Borough on which van dwellings have regularly been placed for many years. The number of vans on the sites varies from time to time. All the sites are subject to regular inspection and are in general reasonably well kept. One additional site came into use during the year, particularly for the accommodation of the caravans of showmen engaged at the Festival Pleasure Gardens in Battersea Park. The site was provided with adequate water supplies, sanitary accommodation, etc., in compliance with the Council's By-laws. Three cases of the placing of an odd caravan on a bombed site also came to light. In one case, adequate water, sanitary accommodation, etc., were available, and no action could be taken. In the other two, these essentials were absent, and notices were in consequence served under the by-laws. The caravans were subsequently removed. Dangerous Structures. Seventy-two cases in which structures or parts thereof had been noted, in the course of inspections for various purposes, as appearing to be unsafe, were referred to the District Surveyor of the London County Council for his attention. 25 Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. This Act, which came into operation on the 31st March, 1950, repealed, and re-enacted, with many alterations and additions, the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. It gives power generally to the to require steps to be taken to eradicate infestations of rats and mice, and to prevent infestations. These duties are carried out by the Rodent Officer, assisted by three Rodent Operatives. All infestations coming to light, whether by way of complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated, and the appropriate action taken. Where the cause of the trouble is obviously defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is called upon to effect the necessary repairs. This aspect of the work involves close co-operation between the Rodent Control Staff and the Sanitary Inspectors. In other cases, the occupier is called on to set traps, lay baits or take other action as the circumstances may require. The setting of traps and laying of baits is, on request, carried out by the Rodent Control Staff, charges being made for this service. These charges are usually nominal except in the case of business premises, where the cost is charged in full. The sewers under the control of the Council are treated twice yearly, in accordance with the suggestion of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Infestation Control Division). Their recommended method of treatment, namely, the laying of prebait (unpoisoned) on two days, followed on the third day by poisoned bait, is followed. The Ministry make a grant of 50 per cent, towards the cost of the service, in so far as this is not recovered from the owners or occupiers of premises. The following table shows the prevalence of rats and mice in the Borough for the year:— Property Infested by Rats Seriously infested by Mice Major Minor - Council's properties - 2 65 Dwelling houses - 136 Business premises - 23 22 r - 161 87 The total number of visits made to the above premises, and to others which were found not to be infested, was 2,520. Poison baits were laid or traps set on 1,596 occasions. Shops Act, 1950. One exemption certificate was issued under Section 38 of this Act, in respect of a shop where restricted space precluded the provision of a sanitary convenience on the premises. The only persons engaged being the proprietor and his wife, the sanitary convenience at their residence, which is within 50 yards of the shop, was accepted as a suitable alternative. 26 Vacant Sites, Static Water Tanks, etc. Complaints continued to be made of nuisances caused by the dumping of rubbish in disused static water tanks, and on cleared sites and in derelict buildings, and by the accumulation of stagnant rainwater in static water tanks, although they were less numerous than in preceding years. In some cases, the rubbish consisted merely of builder's material, scrap metal, etc., which, although unsightly, could not be said to be a danger to health. In certain instances, however, dead animals, vegetable refuse, old bedding, and other material of a putrescible nature were found. It appears that the primary responsibility for abating any nuisance so caused rests upon the owner of the site, but in view of the difficulty and delay which would have arisen in most cases from any attempt to enforce this responsibility, the Council themselves undertook the removal of any such material causing or likely to cause danger to health, a special provision of £100 having been made for this purpose. Four cases in which particular nuisance was being caused by accumulations of water and rubbish in static water tanks were, however, taken up with the owners of the sites. In two of these cases, the tanks were emptied and cleansed, the other two being still outstanding at the end of the year. Burial of Deceased Persons. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are responsible for the burial or cremation of the body of any person dying or being found dead in the Borough, and have power to recover from the estate of the deceased person, or from any person who, under the Act, was liable to maintain the deceased immediately prior to his death, their expenses incurred in carrying out the duty, in so far as these expenses are not covered by any grant made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. During the year, 15 cases were dealt with, as per the following table:— Died in St. James's Hospital ... ... 5 „ at home 9 Body found at Clapham Junction Railway Station 1 15 The burials arranged by the Council are carried out by a local undertaker under contract, and not more than one coach is provided for followers. The Health Department make the arrangements and collect all available information regarding any estate left by the deceased, particulars of his National Insurance, and the existence of any "liable" relatives. This information is passed to the Borough Treasurer so that he may take steps to recover the cost. The total cost incurred in dealing with the 15 cases was £99 of which £63 had been recovered by the end of the year. 27 Aged and Infirm Persons. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are empowered to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for the removal to a hospital or other suitable place of any person who is aged or infirm or suffering from some grave chronic disease, and is living under insanitary conditions. This power is exercisable on the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health. The Order remains operative for a period of three months, but the Court may, on application by the Council, extend it for such further periods, not exceeding three months each, as are considered necessary. One such case was dealt with during the year. This was a Woman of 78 years of age, who lived alone in two rooms on the top floor of a three-storeyed house, and who, by reason of her advanced age and physical condition, was clearly quite unable to devote to herself proper care and attention, and was, in consequence, living under the most deplorable conditions. No relatives could be traced. The Order was duly made and she was removed to hospital. Two applications had subsequently to be made to the Court for her detention for further periods of three months, and were granted. Eventually, however, she agreed to remain permanently in the hospital and give up her rooms. In a second case, that of a widow aged 74 years, who also Was living alone in very unsatisfactory conditions, and whose relatives declined to accept any responsibility for her, the Health Committee authorised an application to the Court for an Order, but before the application could be made she agreed voluntarily to enter hospital. A number of other cases of persons, mostly of advancing years, alleged to be living under unsatisfactory conditions, were reported. In none of these was there justification for certifying that an application for an Order for removal be made. In some cases, however, it was found possible to arrange voluntary admission to hospital, and other cases were under observation at the end of the year. The procedure under Section 47, as outlined above, was amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, which came into operation on the 1st September, 1951, for the purpose of enabling very urgent cases to be dealt with more expeditiously. This new Act provides that the Court, or a single Justice of the Peace, may, on the certificates of the Medical Officer of Health and another registered medical practitioner, make an Order without formal notice of the application having been given to the person concerned or to the hospital authority, subject, in the case of the latter, to evidence being produced of their willingness to admit the person. The length of time a person may be detained under such an Order is limited to three weeks, instead of three months, and any application for an extension of this Period must be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section 47. An application under the new Act may be made by the Medical Officer of Health without special authority from the Health Committee in each individual case, provided a genera authority to act is given. Such general authority was in tact given by the Council at their meeting on the 3rd October. 28 Rag Flock and other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act, which came into force on the 1st November, 1951, and is enforceable by the Council, repealed the Rag Flock Acts, 1911 and 1928, and Section 136 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, which dealt with the sale of rag flock. It enacts new provisions relating not only to rag flock, but also to a number of other filling materials, e.g., kapok, feathers, down, straw, hair, unwoven cotton and woollen substances, etc., specified in it. The Minister of Local Government and Planning, and the Home Secretary, acting jointly, have power to extend this list. The principal provisions of the Act are as follows Registration : Premises in which rag flock or other filling materials are used in upholstering, or the stuffing or lining of bedding, toys, baby carriages, and any other articles prescribed by regulations, must be registered with the Council. Excluded from this requirement, however, are premises used for re-making or reconditioning any such article, or for upholstering in connection with railway carriages, road vehicles, ships or aircraft, or other kinds of upholstering which may be prescribed. Registration, once effected, is continuous, and a fee of £1 may be charged for it. The Act contains no provisions enabling the Council to refuse registration. Licensing: Premises used for the manufacture or storage of rag flock (but not other filling materials) must be licensed by the Council. Applications for licences may be refused on the ground of unsuitability of premises, subject to a right of appeal to the Minister of Local Government and Planning. Licences are renewable annually. Entry, Inspection and Sampling: An authorised officer of the Council has right of entry at all reasonable times to registered or licensed premises, or premises which he has grounds for believing should be registered or licensed. He may inspect any articles, and take samples of any filling materials. For the latter purpose he may open up the covering of any article to obtain access to the filling. If he exercises this power, the Council are responsible for the repair of the article, and, unless the owner is convicted of an offence under the Act, for any diminution in its value. The Medical Officer of Health, and Sanitary Inspectors, are deemed to be authorised officers. Offences: The following are offences under the Act:— 1. Illegal use of premises which should be registered or licensed. 2. Failure to give notice of change of occupation of registered premises. 3. The presence, on registered premises, of filling materials or, on licensed premises, of rag flock, which are not clean. 4. The delivery to registered premises of rag flock other than from licensed premises. 5. Transactions in filling materials which are not clean. 6. Failure to keep prescribed records. 7. Possession, offer for sale, or sale, of articles (other than secondhand articles) upholstered, lined or stuffed with materials which are not clean. 8. Obstruction of an authorised officer in the execution of the Act. Offences under 4, 5 and 7 are subject to a warranty defence. 29 The Minister subsequently made the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Regulations, 1951, prescribing standards of cleanliness for each kind of filling material, the methods of testing samples, the nature of the tests to be applied, the names and addresses of Analysts, the form of certificate of analysis, and the fees payable. There are no premises in the Borough dealing with rag flock. There are, however, four premises at which other filling materials are used in such circumstances as to require them to be registered. Registration of these premises was duly effected. PROTECTION OF FOOD SUPPLY. (A)—INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES. Regular inspection of all premises where food for human consumption is prepared, stored, or sold has always been carried out as a routine measure. In the Annual Report for 1950, however, it was mentioned that, having regard to the phenomena increase in the number of catering establishments during and since the war, and the increasing recognition of the amount of illness caused by the consumption of food prepared under unhygienic conditions, the inspections could no longer be carried out with sufficient frequency by the existing staff of Sanitary Inspectors engaged on that particular work, and that, in consequence, the Council had appointed an additional Sanitary Inspector (Miss A. L. Jones), who took up her duties in November, 1950. During the early part of 1951, this Inspector undertook a complete survey of all catering establishments, with particular attention to those at which a full range of meals is served. Canteens at the larger industrial premises were also visited. At these inspections, attention was paid not only to the construction a nd equipment of the premises, but also to the general standard of hygiene prevailing in them, and to the methods adopted by the Persons engaged in the handling and preparation of food, since this latter is of paramount importance among the many aspects of food hygiene. In general, the conditions found were quite good. There were however, many instances in which it was obvious that there was room for improvement. In dealing with these, the action taken was of an educational nature rather than on the lines of formal enforcement of the law relating to food The re ception accorded to the Inspector amply justified this line of a ction. In the vast majority of cases, the proprietors readily accepted and implemented the advice and suggestions put forward In a very few instances only was it necessary to take any formal a ction. As a result of these activities, it can be said that a very Material improvement took place in the general standard o food preparation and handling in the Borough. Inspections are, ot pourse, being continued in order to ensure that the improvemen s maintained and, where possible, enhanced. 30 Restaurant Kitchens, etc. The number of restaurants and cafés (including fixed and mobile stalls) on the register at the end of the year was 195. 953 inspections were made. Reference is made in the preceding paragraph to the inspection of these premises. Festival Pleasure Gardens, Battersea Park. May, 1951, saw the opening of these gardens, which formed an integral part of the Festival of Britain celebrations. They were designed to recapture the spirit of the Vauxhall, Cremorne and Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens which were a feature of London life in the 18th and 19th centuries, providing amusement and refreshment for their patrons. They remained open for six months, and in that time were visited by over 8,000,000 people. Obviously the provision of refreshment for this multitude was an undertaking of considerable magnitude. It required the services of 15 cafés (varying from first-class restaurants at which a full-course dinner, with waiter service, could be obtained, to the humble snack bar at which one need purchase nothing more than a cup of tea), 14 ice cream kiosks, 3 beer gardens, and numerous kiosks for the sale of "hot-dogs," potato fritters, jellied eels, shellfish, soft drinks, sweets, etc. Under a special Act of Parliament, the Company operating the Gardens had exemption from the requirements of the Building Acts and Drainage By-laws, but this exemption did not relieve them from compliance with the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and other Public Health enactments. In consequence, the Council were in a position to exercise full control over the cafés and other places where food was prepared and sold. Numerous and regular inspections were therefore made. It is gratifying to record that the general standard of hygiene was very high. In the larger restaurants, especially, the equipment was of the very latest design, much thought had been given to the layout of the kitchens, and every possible facility for the hygienic handling and service of food was provided. The only serious fault found was that in some cases the provision of proper aerial disconnection between kitchens and sanitary conveniences had been overlooked. This was, however, remedied immediately it was brought to the notice of the Company. Even in the kiosks, hot and cold running water, and a supply of soap and towels, were provided either in the kiosks themselves or at a readily accessible point. Not unnaturally, there were a few instances in which minor improvements were felt to be desirable, and the Company very readily agreed to any suggestions made to them. It is interesting to record that not a single case of serious illness was attributed to the enormous quantities of food and drink which must have been consumed during the six months the Gardens were open to the public, nor was any complaint of any substance made about the conditions under which the catering arrangements operated. 31 Clean Food Exhibition. As foreshadowed in the Annual Report for 1950, a Clean Food Exhibition was held in January, 1951. Full information regarding this exhibition is contained in a report which was submitted to the Council in March, 1951, and is reproduced as an Appendix to this Report. Slaughterhouses. There is only one licensed slaughterhouse in the Borough. Its use ceased about the middle of 1950 and had not been resumed at the end of 1951. Butchers' Shops. There are 74 butchers' shops in the Borough, and in addition a number of shops where cooked meats are sold. All these shops are systematically inspected, 936 visits having been made during the year. In general, the shops are well conducted, and no formal action was found necessary. Three shops where horseflesh is sold for human food are included in the above figure. Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924. No offence against the Regulations was reported during the year. Dairies and Milkshops. The following table gives the dairies and milkshops registered in the Borough, and the changes during 1951:— (a) Dairies where loose milk is sold, and both the premises and the occupier are registered:— J Retail Wholesale Total On register at 1st January Added during year 47 - 7 54 - - 47 7 54 Removed during year:— (i) Transferred to (c) below 4 - 4 (ii) Transferred to (b) below 3 3 - On register at 31st December 7 40 47 (b) Milkshops, where milk is sold only in sealed containers, and only the occupier is registered:— On register at Ist January ... ... ... 83 Added during year, by transfer from (a) above 3 „ „ „ by new registrations ... 9 95 Removed during year 1 On register at 31st December 94 32 (c) "Out-of-Borough " registrations (i.e., persons selling milk in Battersea from premises in other boroughs) :— On register at 1st January 21 Transferred from (a) above 4 New registrations 3 On register 31 st December 28 A total of 287 visits were made to these shops during the year. Generally they are very well conducted. In 4 cases, however, it was found necessary to draw the occupier's attention to minor contraventions of the statutory requirements. These were rectified without recourse to formal action. Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949. Enforcement of these Regulations, which relate to premises where milk is stored, processed, or sold, is dealt with in the preceding paragraph. It was not found necessary to take any action under Regulation 20, which gives power to the Medical Officer of Health to stop the supply of milk suspected of conveying infectious disease. Milk (Special Designations). Under the two sets of Milk (Special Designations) Regulations issued in 1949, four designations are prescribed, namely, Accredited, Tuberculin Tested, Pasteurised, and Sterilised. Accredited Milk may not be heat-treated. Tuberculin Tested milk may be pasteurised or sterilised, provided it is so described. Pasteurised milk must be so treated by either the "Holder" or "High Temperature Short Time" processes, and must comply with the "phosphatase" and "methylene blue" tests. Sterilised milk must be filtered or clarified, homogenised, and heated to and maintained at a temperature of not less than 212° F. for such time as will ensure that it complies with the "turbidity" test. All persons who pasteurise or sterilise, or deal in special designation milk, are required to hold licences, which (except in the case of producers of raw milk) are issued by Food and Drugs Authorities. The Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order, 1951, which came into force on the 1st October, 1951, requires that all milk sold by retail (other than in catering establishments as part of a meal or refreshment) in the areas specified must be sold under one or other of the special designations. Among such areas is the whole of the County of London. The number of licences issued by the Council during 1951 was as follows:— Accredited Full Supplementary — — Tuberculin Tested 47 20 Pasteurised 85 21 Sterilised 112 23 244 64 33 Two licences to pasteurise, and one to sterilise milk were issued, and are included in the above figures. Details of examination of samples of pasteurised and sterilised milk are given on page (39). Ice Cream Premises. The number of premises registered for the manufacture, storage, and/or sale of ice cream at the end of the year was 176, 76 having been added and 5 removed during the course of the year. One application for registration was refused on the ground of unsuitability of the premises. The applicant did not exercise his right of appeal to the Court. All these premises are regularly inspected, 490 visits being made. Particular attention is paid to premises where manufacture takes place, and not only are the premises, plant, and methods of operation scrutinised, but samples of the products are taken for examination by the methods suggested by the Ministry of Health. The premises generally are found to be well conducted. Further reference to sampling of ice cream will be found on page (40). Fish Shops. Shops in which fish, either cooked or uncooked, is sold, or where the curing or smoking of fish is carried on, are regularly inspected. There were 55 such shops in the Borough in 1951. 278 inspections were made, and 4 notices were served, for minor matters which were remedied without difficulty. Street Stalls. All street stalls from which food for human consumption is sold are regularly inspected and, where the food sold is stored in the Borough, the storage places are also inspected. It was not found necessary to take any formal action during the year. Unsound Food. The following table gives particulars of the unsound foodstuffs which, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 180 (8), were voluntarily surrendered to the Council. Most of these foodstuffs were ultimately used for the manufacture of animal feeding stuffs. Fish (preserved) 1,049 tins, 1 box Fish (wet) 25 boxes Meat and sausages (preserved)... 1,644 tins, 3 tons 17 cwts. 1½bs. Meat and sausages (fresh) ... 19 cwts. 2 qtrs. 1 st. 1 lb.

Puddings 15 tins Soups 320 tins Spaghetti 70 tins Lemonade crystals ... 6 lbs. Fourteen cases of the presence of foreign matter in food came to light during the year. All were reported to the Health Committee, on whose instructions legal proceedings were taken in seven cases. In six of these, convictions were secured, fines totalling £24 being imposed and £21 costs awarded to the Council. In the seventh, the defendant was discharged absolutely under the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, on payment of £5 5s. costs. The remaining seven cases were dealt with by cautionary letters. Food Poisoning. During the year seven cases of food poisoning were notified. All were isolated cases and of a minor nature, and call for no special comment. PROTECTION OF FOOD SUPPLY. (B)—SAMPLING OF FOOD AND DRUGS. The analysis of samples of food and drugs, procured under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, or informally (i.e., without following the procedure prescribed by the Act), and the examination of samples of heat-treated milk and of ice-cream by the prescribed tests, are carried out by the Public Analyst for the Borough (J. E. Woodhead, Esq., B.SC., F.R.I.C., PH.c.) at his laboratory at 325 Kennington Road, London, S.E.11. The total number of formal samples taken under the Act during 1951 was 557, of which 6, or 1.1 per cent, were certified to be adulterated. In addition, 643 informal samples were procured, of which 12, or 1.9 per cent., were reported against. The percentage of samples reported by the Public Analyst to be adulterated during the quinquennia 1921 to 1950 and in 1951 is given in the following table:- Formal samples (per cent.) Informal samples (per cent.) Year Mean 1921—1925 6.4 7.4 „ 1926—1930 2.4 3.3 „ 1931—1935 1.8 2.1 „ 1936—1940 0.9 0.9 „ 1941—1945 1.4 1.1 „ 1946—1950 1.0 1.1 1951 1.1 1.9 35 The following tables give details of the articles of which samples were obtained for the purpose of analysis.

Of the 428 samples, 45 were designated as " Channel Islands" or "South Devon" milk, for which a higher minimum percentage (viz. 4 per cent.) of milk fat content is provided for under arrangements made between the producers and the Ministry of Food. The average composition of these 45 samples of milk reported as genuine proved to be as under: — Total milk solids ... ... 13.48 per cent. Milk fat ... ... ... ... 4.37 „ Non-fatty solids 9.11 „ 38 Of the remaining 383 samples, one was reported as adulterated, and the remaining 382 as genuine, the average composition of the genuine samples being as under: — Total milk solids ... ... 12.37 per cent. Milk fat 3.61 „ Non-fatty solids 8.76 „ The Analyst reports that the content of milk fat in these 382 samples ranged as follows:— 4 per cent, and over 30 samples or 7.9 per cent.

The following action was taken in regard to the 6 formal samples certified as adulterated: — No. 189. Ice Cream. 20 per cent, deficient in fat. Cautionary letter. No. 263. Ice cream. 44 per cent, deficient in fat in each case. No. 296. Legal proceedings taken. Defendant discharged absolutely under the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, and ordered to pay £5 5s. Od. costs on the first summons. The second summons was not separately dealt with. No. 308. Milk. 6 per cent, deficient in milk fat. Legal proceedings taken. Defendant fined £2 0s. 0d. and ordered to pay £5 5s. 0d. costs. No. 354. Pork Sausage Meat. 10 per cent, deficient in meat content. Cautionary letter. No. 530. Ice Cream. 22 per cent, deficient in fat. Cautionary letter. Heat Treated Milk. Samples of pasteurised and sterilised milk are taken at regular intervals for submission to the Public Analyst for the prescribed tests, and during the year samples as under were taken with the results set out:— Phosphatase Methylene Blue Satisfactory Failed Satisfactory Failed Pasteurised ... 30 — 30 — Turbidity Satisfactory Failed Sterilised 22 Monthly returns of the samples taken, and of the results of the examinations, are sent to the Milk Division of the Ministry of Food, an d they are at once notified of any adverse report. 40 Ice Cream. Seventeen samples of ice cream were taken during the year, each sample being submitted to the presumptive test for coliform organisms in 3 tubes at 1/10 ml. dilution, and to the methylene blue test, in accordance with the technique suggested by the Ministry of Health. The following is a summary of the results : — Coliform Test. Methylene Blue Test Negative ... 12 Provisional Grade 1 ... 9 Positive in 1 tube ... 1 „ „ 2 ... 4 „ „ 2 tubes ... — „ „ 3 ... 4 „ „ 3 tubes ... 4 „ „ 4 ... — 17 17 Where samples of ice cream made at premises in the Borough received unsatisfactory reports, the premises, plant, and methods of operation were examined, and, where possible, improvements were suggested. Milk supplied to Schools and Hospitals. Samples of milk in course of delivery to Schools and Hospitals in the Borough are regularly taken, both for chemical analysis and, where the milk is supplied under a "Special Designation," for submission to the prescribed tests for such milk. These samples are included in the general totals given on pages 36, 38 and 39. The results of the analyses and tests are communicated to the London County Council or to the appropriate Hospital Management Committee. Housing. Provision of New Accommodation. During the year 1951 the erection of 115 new flats by the Council was completed, as follows:— Tyneham Close, Tyneham Road 22 Abbott House, Nightingale Lane... ... ... ... 17 Fineran Court, St. John's Hill ... ... 21 Westbridge House, Westbridge Road ... ... ... 20 Stephen Sanders Court, Bolingbroke Grove ... ... 35 115 The erection of four blocks (143 flats) on the Rollo Street site was commenced. Active steps towards the acquisition of further sites, with a view to their re-development as housing sites, were being taken at the end of the year. Two privately owned houses, demolished by enemy action during the war, were rebuilt by the owners. 41 Summary of New Accommodation Provided. By Battersea Borough Council 115 By Private Enterprise 2 117 Action taken under Section 9, Housing Act, 1936. One formal notice was served during the year. Repairs to five houses were completed—one by the owner after service of an informal notice in 1950; three by the owners after service of formal notices in 1950; and one by the Council in default of compliance by the owner with a formal notice served in 1950. One informal and one formal notice were still outstanding at the end of the year. In the latter case, repairs by the owner were in hand. Closing Orders. Fourteen Closing Orders under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, were made during the year, all in respect of basement rooms. Two Closing Orders, made in previous years (one in respect of a basement room and one in respect of the upper part of a house comprising four rooms) were determined, the accommodation having been rendered fit for human habitation. Demolition Orders. One house was demolished in pursuance of a Demolition Order made in 1950 under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936. An undertaking, under Section 11(3) of the Act, was given by the owner of a house divided into three self-contained tenements, all of which were unfit for human habitation, that they would not be used for that purpose until the Council, on being satisfied that they had been rendered fit, cancel the undertaking. Houses Let in Lodgings. No special action was taken in respect of such houses. Overcrowding. 151 cases of overcrowding were discovered during the year, 109 in consequence of applications for housing accommodation made to this Council, and 42 to the London County Council. Sixty-nine overcrowded families were rehoused during the the year, 46 by this Council and 23 by the London County Council. 42 Housing Accommodation Applications. All applications made to the Council are normally dealt with by the Housing Manager, who refers to me those cases in which the application is based wholly or partly on medical grounds. These cases include applications for transfer from Council tenants and licensees of requisitioned premises. He also refers certain cases in which some special feature is involved (e.g., fitness of basement rooms). Under the Council's "Points Scheme," points are allocated by the Housing Manager for statutory overcrowding, bedroom deficiency, lack of a separate home, etc., and he refers to me cases of ill-health (for which additional points up to a maximum of 15 for pulmonary tuberculosis and 10 for other conditions can be allocated), and unsuitable accommodation (for which the maximum additional points is 10). Each case is placed in a group according to the number of bedrooms required by the family. Applications with the highest number of points in each group are submitted to the Housing Committee for instructions. Cases where the applicant or a member of his household is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and is infectious, and where the accommodation is considered to be inadequate, are submitted to the Committee irrespective of the total number of points allocated. The points scheme does not apply to applications for transfers from Council or requisitioned property, which are still dealt with under the previous system, " essential" and "advisable" recommendations being made on medical grounds. During 1951, a total of 693 cases were dealt with under the arrangements set out in the three preceding paragraphs. The maximum number of points on medical grounds other than pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated to 51 applications. In 39 cases the maximum points were given for pulmonary tuberculosis, 30 of these being referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration as the accommodation was inadequate. In 23 cases of transfer applications, rehousing was recommended as essential on medical grounds. The London County Council also refer cases in which there appears to be overcrowding, for the submission, in appropriate cases, of an "orange form." Overcrowding was found to exist in 42 instances. The London County Council also notify cases in which the application alleges sanitary defects. The houses are inspected, and action to secure the remedy of any defects found is taken. Increase of Rent, &c., Acts. Two certificates that houses or parts thereof were not in a reasonable state of repair were issued to tenants. 43 Statistics for the Year ended 31st December, 1951.

The London County Council pay a rent for the use of the Coroner's Court. For a number of years this has been £275 per annum, but after considerable negotiations they agreed to increase it to £450 per annum as from 1st April, 1950. Subsequently, in August, 1951, the London County Council gave notice to terminate their tenancy of the Court on 31st March, 1952. 49 Personal Cleansing Station. During the year 1951 there were 1,858 children and 200 adults cleansed and treated at the Station. Of the 1,858 children attending, 267 were suffering from scabies or itch, a contagious parasitic skin affection. The remainder were verminous. Of these children 1,770 attended from the public elementary schools in the Borough by arrangement with the London County Council, who have entered into a contract with the Battersea Borough Council for the use of their Personal Cleansing Station. The cleansing and treatment of the school children is carried out under the supervision of officers of the London County Council while the disinfestation of the clothing and (if necessary) of the homes is carried out concurrently by the Borough Council's sanitary staff. The homes of all cases of scabies that come to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health are visited by the Council's Sanitary Inspectors. The following table shows the numbers of persons cleansed and treated at the Personal Cleansing Station and the expenditure incurred since 1906, the year in which the cleansing of verminous persons Was begun: — Number of Baths, &c.

Other columns, calendar year. 50 The contract with the London County Council, referred to above, provides for the payment by them of 2s. per verminous case and 1s. per scabies case treated, with a minimum payment of £400 per annum. Towards the end of the year negotiations were opened with the County Council with a view to the payments being increased, in consequence of the ever-increasing cost of maintaining the Station and the fact that the scale had remained unaltered since the agreement was originally made in 1921 The Council, at their meeting on the 23rd May, decided, on the recommendation of the Health Committee, to' accede, until further order, to a request of the Divisional Medical Officer, No. 9 Division, London County Council, for the use of the Station for the treatment of a small number of children suffering from minor ailments, without charge. 51 APPENDIX. Report of the Medical Officer of Health on Clean Food Exhibition I have pleasure in presenting herewith my Report on the above Exhibition, which was held at Southlands Public Hall, Shuttleworth Road, S.W.11, from Tuesday, 23rd January, to Saturday, 27th January, inclusive. It was open each day from 10.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. As a preliminary to the Exhibition, a meeting was held in the Central Library, Lavender Hill, S.W.11, on the evening of Monday, 22nd January. Invitations to attend were sent to all Members of the Council and of the Battersea Food Control Committee, to local Members of Parliament and of the London County Council, to the editors of local newspapers, and to other interested persons, while a number of local organisations, whom it was thought would be interested in the subject of Clean Food, were invited to send delegates. The total number of persons to whom invitation cards were sent was 152, of whom 64 actually attended. At the meeting the Chair was taken by His Worship the Mayor, and the principal speaker was Dr. Robert Sutherland, Medical Adviser and Secretary to the Central Council for Health Education, who spoke generally on the topic of Food Hygiene. Questions from the audience were invited, and an interesting discussion followed. In connection with, and supplementary to, the Exhibition, a series of film displays were put on at the Lower Town Hall, under the auspices of the Central Office of Information. The principal film shown was "Another Case of Poisoning," and other short films dealing with various aspects of Food Hygiene were included in the programmes. To publicise the Exhibition and Film Shows, advertisements }vere inserted in the two local newspapers on the two Fridays immediately preceding the opening date, and 50 large and 150 s mall posters were printed and displayed in certain of the Council's establishments, on poster sites, and in the windows of shops, restaurants, etc., where food is handled. Letters were also sent, the approval of the London County Council as Education Authority, to the head teachers of all senior schools in the borough, inviting them to send organised parties of their older children to both the Exhibition and to the films. All the stall stands in which the exhibits were displayed were oaned and installed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, who also provided and operated a small cinema where films relating to rats and mice were shown, and fitted out one of the stands with exhibits on the same subject, including some live specimens which attracted much interest. The stands were arranged as follows:— 1 Posters, dealing generally with Clean Food (supplied on loan by the Ministry of Health). 2. Personal Hygiene, illustrating the various ways in which inattention to personal hygiene could result in food becoming 52 contaminated, and the precautions to be taken to prevent such contamination. 3. & 4. Catering Hygiene, showing a general lay-out of a wellequipped kitchen attached to a canteen or restaurant, the types of fittings which should be installed, and hygienic methods of handling and cleansing crockery, utensils, etc. 5. Domestic Kitchen (good), showing a typical domestic kitchen, well maintained by the housewife (for comparison with stand No. 6). 6. Domestic Kitchen (bad), showing a kitchen equipped on exactly similar lines to that shown on Stand No. 5, but badly maintained. 7. & 8. Milk, illustrating the production and distribution of clean milk, and showing models of modern pasteurising, bottle washing, and bottle filling plants. 9 Retail Shop, showing a good type of retail shop, with special emphasis on the protection of those foods which are specially liable to carry infection. 10. Ice Cream, illustrating the production and distribution of ice cream under hygienic conditions. 11. Rats and Mice. This stand has already been referred to above. 12. Work of the Public Health Department. This stand showed some aspects of the work done by the Department in safeguarding food—e.g., sampling of food for chemical analysis and bacteriological examination, inspection of food and of food premises, the investigation of food poisoning cases, etc. The Exhibits on Stands Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10 were provided and arranged in their entirety by private firms. Those on Stands Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were mostly loaned by local firms and arranged by the staff of the Public Health Department. The latter provided and arranged nearly all the exhibits on Stand No. 12, on which was also shown cultures of various organisms associated with food poisoning, and a series of charts showing how food poisoning spreads. These exhibits were loaned by the Central Public Health Laboratory. The net cost to the Council of the Exhibition and Film Shows, inclusive of hire of halls, amounted to approximately £150. The attendance at the Film Shows at the Lower Town Hall was 1,691, including the school parties. It was not possible to keep an accurate record of the number attending the Exhibition itself, but it is thought that this was somewhere about 500 members of the general public and 200 school children, figures which I think are rather disappointing, and unworthy of the very considerable time and trouble taken in its preparation. As already instructed by the Committee, I have conveyed their appreciation and thanks to the authorities and traders who contributed to the staging of the Exhibition by the loan of exhibits or in other ways, and to the staff of the Public Health Department, who prepared and set out the exhibits and were on duty to answer enquiries. G. MACDONALD, Medical Officer of Health.
