AC 4413(1) Owners 2/Library MAL 24 Borough of Malden and Coombe Annual Report OF THE Medical Officer of Health AND THE Chief Public Health Inspector FOR THE YEAR 1960 BOROUGH OF MALDEN AND COOMBE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1960 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Maiden. August, 1961. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1960 which has been prepared in accordance with the Ministry of Health Circular No. 1/61 . The work of the Public Health Department has been very much handicapped by staff difficulties throughout the year. In a small department the loss of one or two of its staff for any appreciable time presents considerable difficulty. The routine work has, however, continued to be carried out and much credit is due to the staff for the way in which this has been done. The tragically sudden death of Mr. S. J. T. Wood in September was not only a severe loss to his many friends but also to the Council as a whole, for he had an enthusiasm for his work which quickly infected those with whom he was associated, and a pleasant manner which enabled him to carry out his duties in an easy and friendly way. He was succeeded as Chief Public Health Inspector by his previous deputy, Mr. P. E. Kinton, who is to be congratulated on the way in which he assumed his responsibilities in the face of his own personal sense of loss. There have been no major developments during the year. Routine programmes for the protection of the community against poliomyelitis, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus have been stepped up with satisfactory results. The occurrence of small isolated outbreaks of diphtheria in various parts of the country has re-emphasised the importance of maintaining this work at the highest possible level. It 2. is best carried out by the assiduous application of routine measures and the continued co-operation of head teachers of schools and general practitioners which makes this possible is much appreciated. The population of the district has remained practically unchanged for a number of years. In Common with the country as a whole the proportion of persons of pensionable age is gradually rising. This figure is at present approximately one in seven of the population and it is estimated that it will rise to one in six during the next ten years. The majority of elderly people are able to maintain themselves in their own homes with the support and help of their families and the various voluntary and statutory services. There is a small number, however, whose increasing disability, probably accelerated by illness, makes this extremely difficult, particularly when they are living in homes more suited in size and type for family residence. This applies also to younger people who are handicapped by physical disablement, some of whom have a housing need which is not occasioned by lack of accommodation but by the unsuitable type of home in which they have to live. Life would be very much easier for them and they could be supported in their own homes to a much greater extent were they to be housed in accommodation designed to meet their needs. The calls upon their limited physical capacity which are occasioned by such things as staircases, coal fires and unsuitable fixtures and fittings would thereby be minimised, leaving them better able to attend to their own personal needs. The flatlets for old people scheme which is sponsored by the Old Peoples Welfare Association and supported by grant from the Council goes some way towards meeting this need, but it may be necessary for the Council to consider in the future whether further action is necessary to meet the increasing requirements of this aspect of the life of the community. The general statistics for the year indicate no dramatic change in trends which have been observed for a number of years. The incidence of serious infectious disease continues to fall, though such relatively minor illnesses as scarlet fever and measles continue to cause domestic and educational difficulties. Complications of the common fevers of childhood are now largely controlled by the use of modern drugs but their nuisance value remains. The rates of birth and death in the Borough remain more or less constant from year to year. The increase in the birth rate which followed World War II and then declined has to some extent been restored though in this district it remains at a level considerably below that of the national figure. This is no doubt a reflection upon the percentage of residents of child bearing age when compared with the country as a whole. It is interesting to note that 29% of the deaths registered during the year were of persons of 80 or more years of age and that of 148 deaths in this group only 42 were males compared with 106 females. 3. In the tables and comment which follow will be found a summary of statistics relating to these and other matters, while the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector presents a summary of the extensive routine visiting and sampling which is carried out in the Borough by his staff. Such vigilance continues to be necessary and indeed the routine work of the Inspectors increases with each successive year. In conclusion I would like to express my appreciation of the interest and support of members of the Public Health Committee and Council during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, P. WESTCOMBE. Medical Officer of Health. 4. PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Acute Poliomyelitis No case of acute poliomyelitis was notified during the year. This was in accordance with the trend of the disease throughout the country as a whole. Concurrent with the general reduction in the number of cases notified during the past few years has been a steady increase in the number of persons protected against the disease by vaccination. It is still too early to measure the full effect of vaccination but there are surely good grounds for guarded optimism. Protection has now been offered to all persons up to the age of forty and also to certain other persons who are exposed to undue risk of infection. By the end of the year approximately 60% of the eligible population had been vaccinated. Diphtheria The following statistics refer to immunisation carried out during the year:- Number of children immunised during the year (pre-school 673, school 140) 813 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 1,475 The efforts made to ensure a high degree of immunity to diphtheria in the community by means of immunisation have perhaps been deprived of some of their force by the poliomyelitis vaccination campaign. The recent occurrence of small isolated outbreaks of diphtheria throughout the country has pointed once again to the continued need for immunisation of all children at an early age and the maintenance of effective protection by reinforcing injections at intervals throughout their school life. Not all parents are aware of this need and during 1960 a sustained attempt was made to improve the acceptance of immunisation with particular stress on the need for reinforcing injections. For the 13th year in succession the district was completely free from this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. Under the National Health Service Act all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services in the scheme. This has resulted in a number of children being immunised otherwise than at schools or clinics. Whooping Cough The number of cases of whooping cough notified was 41. No deaths occurred. 5. Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and. mothers appreciate the facilities for immunisation which are available. It is to be hoped that whooping cough immunisation will prove as effective as immunisation against diphtheria. 534 children were immunised during the year and 108 received a reinforcing dose. Tetanus Inoculation against tetanus has been available since 1956 and is now widely accepted. Although not a common disease, the mortality rate is high and immunisation is recommended. 606 children were immunised during the year and 94 received a reinforcing dose. Smallpox Vaccination Vaccinations 434 Revaccinations 79 513 Of the above, 211 individuals were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners. 380 of the persons vaccinated were under one year of age. The substantial degree of protection from smallpox which the population had during the time of compulsory vaccination is being slowly reduced due to the reduction throughout the country in the numbers of children vaccinated at the appropriate time. The percentage of infants under 1 year vaccinated in this Borough during the year was 67.9%. As with diphtheria immunisation, all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services for carrying out vaccinations. Scarlet Fever The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was 13, giving an incidence rate of 0.28 per thousand, population. All the cases were very mild. Measles 1960 was not an epidemic year for measles which continues to appear regularly in alternate years. Only 8 cases were notified compared with 385 cases the previous year. No deaths occurred. 6. Dysentery 13 cases of sonne dysentery occurred during the year, comparing favourably with 88 cases in the previous year. No cases occurred in institutions. This condition is highly infectious among young children and its incidence has been increasing during the past few years throughout the country. Although this illness is mild it is responsible for significant loss of school time among affected children and contacts and rigid methods of control are necessary to prevent epidemic spread. Food Poisoning There was 1 single case of food poisoning due to staphylococcus aureus. Investigations into cases of suspected dysentery and food poisoning are an important part of the work of the Public Health Department. The majority of such investigations do not reveal any recognisable type of infection or the source from which it came. Early notification by Medical Practitioners of suspected cases of dysentery and food poisoning is essential for effective control of the spread of infection, particularly in communities such as schools and residential homes. The co-operation of family doctors in this respect is much appreciated. Of 35 incidents of suspected food poisoning reported to the Public Health Department and investigated in detail one was found to be a case of staphylococcus aureus food borne infection and in 28 cases the diagnosis was not confirmed on further investigation. One case of salmonella newport was diagnosed in a child attending a residential establishment and two cases of salmonella saint paul were found in a family where no connection with food or other cases of a similar infection in the country could be traced. Two related families were found to be carriers of salmonella typhimurium, but in neither case could food be attributed to the condition. Three outbreaks of suspected food poisoning occurred in institutions an Old People's home, a research establishment and a childrens nursery. At the Old People's home slightly unsound corned beef was thought to be responsible for symptoms typical of staphylococcal food poisoning affecting 26 residents and at the research establishment reheated steak and kidney pie produced symptoms indicative of Clostridium welchii food poisoning. At the nursery 20 children and staff were affected by an outbreak of salmonella typhi-murium infection but food was not traced as being the source. 7. The necessity for scrupulous attention to the cleanliness and soundness of food cannot be over emphasised. If the possibility of food borne infection is to be minimised such matters as hand washing by persons handling food and the absolute prohibition of re-heated meat dishes are vitally important. Anthrax Anthrax was added to the list of infectious diseases notifiable to the Medical Officer of Health by Medical Practitioners. Non-notifiable Diseases Head teachers of Local Education Authority schools notify cases of non-notifiable disease occurring in their schools. This is a useful procedure which is much appreciated. Mumps and chickenpox were the two most prevalent during the year.

NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948 Section 47. It was not necessary to take action under this Act for the removal to hospital of any case during the year. Preventive work is constantly carried out for old people brought to the notice of the Public Health Department as being possibly in need of care and attention. In all cases it was found possible to maintain the old people either in their own homes with the help of the various Statutory and Voluntary Services available, or by gaining their voluntary admission to hospital or to County Welfare Homes. Section 50. Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it was necessary during the year to arrange for one burial. 16.

August, 1961 . To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present this report on behalf of your late Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. S. J. T. Wood, and myself. Mr. P. R. Brackfield, District Public Health Inspector, joined the staff of the department at the end of April, filling the post which had been vacant since October, 1959, and in September Mr. E. E. Jenner commenced work as Technical Assistant (Smoke Control) but unfortunately he was taken ill in November and we were without his services for the remainder of the year. The post of Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector was vacant from October until the end of the year. Staff shortages made it necessary for some routine work to be postponed. Three members of the staff attended courses run by the Coal Utilisation Council dealing with the installation of modern open fires and one member attended a course on Radiation Safety and Health Physics. The Council's five year programme of dealing with unfit houses was completed with the service of a demolition order, two closing orders and the reconditioning of one house with the aid of an improvement grant. A further review of houses in the Borough was undertaken and none found to be incapable of repair at a reasonable expense. The Minister of Housing and Local Government was informed accordingly. Nevertheless when circumstances permit further surveys will be conducted and reports submitted to the Council as necessary. Much time has been directed to improving houses by means of grants and the Council is considering an application submitted by the Maiden and Coombe Housing Society for grant for a further scheme of flatlets for elderly people. 18. Smoke and sulphur dioxide recording apparatus was installed at Kingston Vale where readings were commenced in October and a start has been made on the Council's twelve year plan for Smoke Control Areas covering the whole of the Borough by commencing the survey in No.1. area. During the year the Food Hygiene (General), Food Hygiene (Docks, Carriers etc.), Milk Special Designations, and the Meat (Staining and Sterilization) Regulations were introduced and have the effect of consolidating and strengthening the existing food laws. The general public is increasingly conscious of the need for a high standard in food preparation and handling as shown by the nature of complaints received and it has been observed that in spite of all precautions taken by manufacturers by the installation of modern apparatus, provision has still to be made for the possibility of human error and neglect. The Noise Abatement Act was introduced and it is anticipated that the number of complaints of noise and vibration nuisance will increase following the great amount of publicity given to the subject on television and radio and in the press. It is worthy of comment that the number of invitations to address schools and local organisations on clean food, clean air and on the work of the department increased during the year and it is hoped that this trend will continue. In conclusion I wish to express my appreciation to the Council for promoting me following the sad loss of Mr. Wood and to my colleagues in this and other departments for their co-operation and in particular to Dr. Westcombe for his constant encouragement. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, P. E.KINTON. Chief Public Health Inspector. 19 HOUSING The general standard of housing in the Borough is good. Number of houses built during the year - (a) by the Council 91 (b) by private enterprise 69 Number of houses in course of construction - (a) by the Council 44 (b) by private enterprise 66 For the purpose of abating nuisances or executing repairs to houses the following notices were served - Preliminary 17 Abatement 8 These figures do not include verbal notices often given with regard to minor matters. 1 and 2, Church Road, Worcester Park. Following representations concerning the condition of these dwellings the Council made Closing Orders which prohibit their use for human habitation. Normally Demolition Orders would have been made but these ancient cottages are scheduled under section 30 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 as buildings of special architectural and historic interest. The owner of the premises occupied one dwelling and he was able to obtain alternative accommodation and the occupants of the second dwelling were rehoused by the Council. 16, Cleveland Road. New Maiden. The Council made an Order for the demolition of the above house which could not be repaired at a reasonable expense and the family was rehoused by the Council. The five year programme of dealing with unfit houses in the Borough was completed and a survey conducted during the year indicated that the condition of none of the houses justified demolition. 20 HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT. 1959 The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, came into operation in June, 1959, and provides for standard and discretionary improvement grants. The "Standard Grant" is available for the cost of installing a bath, water closet in or contiguous to the building, hot water system, wash hand basin and satisfactory facilities for storing food in a dwelling without one or more of those facilities. Subject to the dwelling being likely to remain fit for human habitation for not less than 15 years and the applicant having a freehold or leasehold interest, of which not less than 15 years remains unexpired, the local authority must approve a grant. The maximum amount of Standard Grant, which is 50% of the cost of carrying out the work, shall not exceed £155 if all the following facilities are provided. The maximum amount of grant payable for each facility is as follows: Fixed bath or shower in a bathroom £25 Wash hand basin £5 Hot water supply £75 Water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling £40 Satisfactory facilities for storing food £10 On completion, the dwelling must possess all the amenities. The Council has continued to give "Discretionary Grants" for works of improvement or conversion up to a cost of £800 and subject to a grant up to 50% of this cost. Generally speaking Discretionary Grants are given where more extensive work is necessary to provide modern amenities, for example, the construction of a bathroom extension to an existing house. During the year numerous enquiries were made by ratepayers and advice was given. Although many did not avail themselves of the facilities offered a considerable amount of work has been carried out. The following tables show the number of grants approved and payments made during the year: Standard Grants. APPLICATIONS Received. (No. of dwellings). Approved. (No. of dwellings).

WATER SUPPLY The whole of the area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and the supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. In view of the large number of routine bacteriological and chemical examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any routine tests. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION The following disinfections were carried out: Tuberculosis 3 rooms. Other diseases 3 rooms 10 bags of clothing were disinfected. 22 rooms were disinfested for insect pests. 2 ponds were treated for mosquitoes.

A "Sally Lunn" was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that it was a fancy loaf or teacake containing dried fruit and commonly known as currant bread or dough cake. Sally Lunns do not contain dried fruit and the article was not correctly described. The manufacturers offered to withdraw the description and the Council decided to take no further action. Currants - clean. An informal sample of "clean selected currants" were examined and found to contain 0.26% sand and other earthy matter. Following discussions with the retailer and importer the matter was referred to the country of origin and subsequent labels had the word "clean" deleted. Rye Crispbread. Slimming claims for a rye crispbread were discussed with the manufacturers of a product upon which the Public Analyst had reported adversely. The manufacturers undertook to modify their advertisements, but in the absence of scientific evidence certain aspects of the objection to the advertisement were not pursued. Scotch Egg. The Public Analyst reported that an informal sample submitted to him contained one half of a small hard boiled egg with sausage meat of inferior quality. The sausage meat contained about meat instead of a minimum of 50% and he expressed the opinion that a scotch egg should include a whole hen's egg. The manufacturers views were obtained and considered by the Council. 26 Corned Mutton Loaf. A sample of corned mutton loaf was submitted to the Public Analyst and his observations concerning this product and the use of the term "loaf" in connection with a reduced meat content prompted the Council to refer the report to the Pood Standards Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood who were considering canned meat products. MILK During the year the following licences were issued tinder the Milk (Special Designations)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949, or the Milk (Special Designations) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 - 1954. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 provide that in future licences will be issued to dealers for a period expiring at the end of five years. Dealers. Tuberculin tested 8 Pasteurised 11 Sterilised 10 Supplementary. Tuberculin tested 9 Pasteurised 9 Sterilised 10 The difference between a dealer's and a supplementary licence is that, if a dairyman has premises in a local government area where he retails milk he is issued with a dealer's licence. Should he retail milk in another area he must obtain a supplementary licence from the Council of that area. DETAILS OF MILK TESTING CLASS OF MILK NUMBER OF SAMPLES TESTED APPROPRIATE TESTS NUMBER OF SAMPLES PASSED FAILED Pasteurised 42 Phosphatase 42 - Methylene blue 42 - Sterilised 3 Turbidity 3 - Tuberculin tested (Pasteurised) 26 Phosphatase 26 - Methylene blue 26 - 27 The purpose of the phosphatase and methylene blue tests is to determine respectively whether or not the milk has been adequately heat treated and whether it is of good keeping quality. The turbidity test for sterilised milk is to determine whether or not the milk has been adequately sterilised. The greater importance must be attached to the phosphatase test as correct heat treatment or pasteurisation reasonably ensures that all pathogenic organisms have been eliminated. FOOD There are no slaughter houses or knackers' yards in the Borough. The following table lists the food premises in the district by type of business together with the number of inspections. Food Premises No. in District No. of Inspections Made Bakehouses 5 10 Bakers shops 15 8 Butchers 21 13 Confectioners 28 50 Cooked meat shops 1 3 Fish shops (wet or fried) 12 10 Greengrocers 24 13 Greengrocers stalls 1 2 Grocers (including off-licences) 48 45 Institutions 16 12 Milk depots 1 2 Milk shops 4 10 Office and works canteens 15 4 Public houses and hotels 12 4 Restaurants and cafes. 15 15 School canteens 13 15 Sports clubs 17 2 248 208 The following premises are registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for the purposes listed. 28 Food Premises No. in District No. of Inspections Made Ice cream manufacture, sale and storage 1 6 Ice cream, sale and storage 78 50 The preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale 41 36 120 92 It has not been necessary to take formal action under the Pood Hygiene Regulations, 1955. The following unfit foodstuffs were voluntarily surrendered and destroyed or salvaged: Apricot pulp 11 lbs. Beef 117½ lbs. Chopped pork 8 lbs. Cooked ham 55 lbs. Corned beef 54 lbs. Cured pork 4 lbs. Flour 84 lbs. Jam 151 lbs. Lamb 72½ lbs. Minced pork 4 lbs. Ox tongue 11½ lbs. Pork luncheon meat 20 lbs. Sheep liver 11½ lbs. Various frozen foods to the value of £25. FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year a number of complaints were received about foods sold in the district, all of which were investigated. Five complaints were received concerning the condition of bread. In one case where there was mould present and in another where there were particles of iron and oil the Council decided to prosecute and fines of £20 were imposed by the Magistrates. On another occasion the end of a knife blade was found in a loaf of bread. The broken knife was traced in the bakery and the manufacturers were fined £20 when prosecuted. In the other cases the manufacturers were advised that the Council was seriously concerned about complaints of this nature. 29 When mould was found in a meat pie the Council decided to prosecute the retailer and a fine of £15 was imposed. A split pin was found in a bakewell tart and after considering the circumstances the Council expressed its concern to the manufacturers. Two complaints were received concerning foreign matter in milk bottles. As the bottling establishments were outside this Council's area the complaints were referred to neighbouring authorities and in one case the dairy was prosecuted and a fine of £3 was imposed. Sweet corn labelled "Peaches", gills in dressed crab, worm in fish fingers and mould on bacon were among other complaints investigated during the year. ICE CREAM Forty-six samples were submitted to the methylene blue test and all were placed in grade I. The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does serve as a simple and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in manufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certificate giving the results of testing has the following note appended: "Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological re stilts of any single sample. Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade I, 80 per cent into grades I or II, not more than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV". The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947:- Year Samples Taken Grades I or II % Grade III % Grade 17 % 1947 29 13 44.8 13 44.8 3 10.4 1948 84 55 65.4 22 26.2 7 8.4 1949 63 54 85.7 8 12.7 1 1.6 1950 85 81 95.3 4 4.7 0 - 1951 79 74 93.7 5 6.3 0 - 1952 76 71 93.4 5 6.6 0 - 1953 46 43 93.5 1 2.2 2 4.3 30 Year Samples Taken Grades I or II % Grade III % Grade IV % 1954 51 39 76.5 9 17.6 3 5.9 1955 40 37 92.5 2 5.0 1 2.5 1956 52 48 92.3 4 7.7 0 - 1957 54 54 100.0 0 - 0 - 1958 56 56 100.0 0 - 0 - 1959 38 38 100.0 0 - 0 - 1960 46 46 100.0 0 - 0 - It is pleasing to note that for the third year all samples reached the standard of grade I. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT As the Council appoints an analyst for the purposes of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, they may execute any of the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act other than those relating to importation, so far as relates to any foodstuff to which an Order in Council under the Act applies. Inspections were made but it was not necessary to take any action during the year. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT. 1952 This Act is to ensure that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are prescribed. Visits have been made to shops selling heating appliances during the year and advice was given to traders dealing in second-hand appliances. RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951 One renewal of a licence to store rag flock was issued for a wholesale store. Two premises are registered for the purposes of the Act. These are premises where upholstery work is carried on. Two samples were submitted to the Prescribed Analyst who gave a satisfactory report on each. PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951 This Act provides for a system of licensing and inspection of pet shops by local authorities. 31 Two applications for renewal of licences were received and after inspection and report were granted. SHOPS ACT. 1950 There are 372 shops in the Borough and inspections are made in connection with provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, which are concerned with sanitary accommodation, washing facilities, heating, lighting and ventilation. Where plans are submitted of new construction or alteration to shop premises, due consideration is given to ensure that the proposals comply with the provisions of the Act. The Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the administration of the law relating to shop hours, including early closing and Sunday trading. REFUSE TIP Green Lane. Worcester Park. Carshalton and the Merton and Morden Urban District Councils continued to tip clinker and screenings until the 30th August with the result that the playing field adjoining the Green Lane School, which had previously been water-logged and in places too steep for games, is now level and will soon be available for use as playing fields. During the year 79 inspections were made whilst tipping was in progress. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION The obligations of the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, have been fully met. The work of rats and mice destruction continues on a well organised basis, providing a free service to householders and making appropriate charges in the case of business premises, many of which are on annual service agreements. The Borough river boundaries, depots, refuse tips, piggeries and open spaces together with the premises of the North Surrey Joint Sewage Board have received constant attention. One small section of the sewers was treated for a minor infestation. Workable Area Committee meetings sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were held from time to time at which difficulties and new methods of pest control were discussed. 32 INSECT PESTS As in previous years the department was able to be of assistance by giving advice and help to members of the public who suffered inconvenience from insect pests. Nuisance was experienced from wasps during the summer and the department gave all possible assistance and advice. 141 wasp nests were destroyed and the cost of the work was recovered from the occupiers of the premises. The carpet beetle, clover mite and ant continued to be most troublesome. 17 rooms were treated for infestations of bugs and 5 rooms for fleas. 54 council houses were inspected for evidence of vermin. By arrangement with the Surrey County Council eight school kitchens and canteens were sprayed with a residual insecticide as a deterrent against insect infestation. CARAVANS There are no caravan sites in the Borough and no licences were granted to station moveable dwellings in the area. The Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act came into force during the year. PUBLIC SEWERS Stoppages in public sewers (combined drains) were cleared by the department on two hundred and sixty-nine occasions. In a few instances the assistance of sewermen from the Borough Engineer's department was obtained and the assistance received is acknowledged. RAINFALL The following table shows the rainfall in the district during 1960, taken at the North Surrey Joint Sewage Board works, Kingston Vale and Manor Park. 33 The high figure shown for August recorded at Manor Park was chiefly due to a storm which caused widespread flooding and numerous residents sought the advice of the department concerning the flooding of their houses.

In 1959 the Council decided to proceed with making Smoke Control Orders which would apply to the whole of the Borough at the end of twelve years. Thirteen Smoke Control Areas have been planned and subject to the availability of staff it is the Council's intention to deal with three areas before the end of 1963, as follows: (1) 1961 Area No.1 . Coombe Hill area bounded by Kingston Hill, Kingston Vale, Beverley Brook, Coombe Hill Road, Coombe Lane and Warren Road. (2) 1 962 Area No-2. Maiden Golf Course area bounded by Coombe Hill Road, Beverley Brook, Main Railway Line, Coombe Road and Traps Lane. (3) 1965 Area No.5. Maiden Hill area bounded by Main Railway Line Beverley Brook, Maiden Way and Maiden Road. A start was made in September on surveying No.1. Smoke Control Area, but little progress could be made by the end of the year due to the staffing situation. 619 visits were made. 34 It is hoped that greater progress will be made in the forthcoming year to enable Nos. 1 and 2 Smoke Control Areas to come into operation in October, 1962. Clean Air Act. 1955. Five notices of intention to instal furnaces with a rating exceeding 55,000 British thermal units or more per hour were received and the Council approved the plans of one installation where "prior approval" was requested. During the year 58 visits were made in connection with smoke abatement. Atmospheric Pollution - Recording. The Council decided to instal smoke and sulphur dioxide recording apparatus at Kingston Vale in the proposed No.1. Smoke Control Area and the readings taken are tabulated. The following tables show the daily average, and highest and lowest concentrations of smoke expressed in milligrammes per 100 cubic metres and sulphur dioxide concentration as parts per 100 million volumes of air for the years 1959 and 1960.

The Act provides that a complaint of the existence of a nuisance may be made by three or more persons each of whom is the occupier of land or premises and in that capacity is aggrieved by the nuisance. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration from aircraft and in proceedings it is a defence to prove that the best practicable means have been adopted for preventing the nuisance.
