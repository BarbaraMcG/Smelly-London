Francis John Bisley, John Bulmer, Samuel Chafen, Joseph Down, Robert Foottit, Lawrence Stevens, and Henry Hayward, to confer with the Board of Works for the Greenwich District with the view of co-operating with that Board, in urging upon the Metropolitan Board of Works the necessity of the provision of increased facilities for traffic in the Deptford Lower-road. The said Committee met the Committee appointed by the Board of Works for the Greenwich District, and inspected the Black Horse Bridge, Deptford, and the "Royal Oak," corner of Deptford Lower-road, Rotherhithe, when the joint Committee passed a resolution as follows, viz : "Resolved, that it be recommended to the Greenwich District Board of Works, and "to the Rotherhithe Vestry that a joint deputation be appointed to wait upon the "Metropolitan Board of Works to urge upon that Board to carry out the proposals of "the District Board as to Black Horse Bridge, and the approaches thereto ; and the "Rotherhithe Vestry as to the 'Royal Oak ' corner, as Metropolitan Improvements. The Vestry on the 6th April, 1886, adopted the recommendation of the joint Committee, and appointed the gentlemen forming their Special Committee as a deputation on behalf of this parish to wait upon the Metropoliton Board of Works in the matter. 22 On the 6th June, 1886, the deputation appointed by the Greenwich District Board attended the Metropolitan Board of Works, and presented a Memorial urging the Board to widen Blackhorse Bridge, and its approaches, the deputation appointed by the Vestry at the same time attended and presented a Memorial to the Board as follows. To the Honourable the Metropolitan Board of Works.— The memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the County of Surrey, under their Common Seal. Sheweth— That in the month of October, 1885, a Memorial, numerously signed by ratepayers of this Parish, was presented by your Memorialists, praying that immediate steps be taken for effecting a much needed improvement at the "Royal Oak corner, in the Deptford Lower-ioad, by setting back the "Royal Oak" public-house, and two or three of the adjoining houses there, and such Memorial was forwarded to your Honourable Board, on the 9th October, 1885. That your Honourable Board having taken such Memorial into consideration and viewed the locus in quo, came to the conclusion that, although the setting back of the buildings referred to would doubtless be an improvement, the advantages of it would be purely local, and should be undertaken by the Vestry, and not by your Honourable Board, at the cost of the Metropolis at large. That your Memorialists desire to call the attention of your Honourable Board, especially to the fact that the Deptford Lower-road, as the main highway from London to the Metropolitan Meat Market at Deptford, and the Surrey Commercial Docks, and other extensive premises, to and from which a vast stream of tratfic is constantly flowing, amounting, as appeals by a return your Memorialists have had taken, to upwards of 3,000 vehicles per day, comprising vehicles ot all descriptions, but more particularly heavy timber carriages, meat vans, and tramcais. That owing to the sharp curve and the difficulty the traffic has at times of clearing the corner, serious accidents are occurring there every day, through horses falling, &c. That the above facts in the opinion of your Memorialists are conclusive as to the benefits which will result to the public at large by the suggested alteration being carried out ; the traffic along th s roadway not being of a local character at all, but forming some of the most important traffic of the whole of London. That in order to complete the Improvement contemplated by the Street Improvement Acts, 1877 and 1882, and to render the same perfect, and also to open a direct communication between London Bridge and Woolwich, it is necessary that the roadway at the "Royal Oak" as well as at the Blackhorse Bridge, Deptford, should be widened, the latter being a most inconvenient and dangerous place, and quite unsuited to the needs or the present day. 23 Your Memorialists, therefore, humbly pray that your Honourable Board will be pleased to re-consider the determination expressed in the tatter received bv your Memorialists on the 2nd December, 1885, and that you will carry out the alterations at the "Royal Oak," Deptford Lower-road, and Blackhorse Bridge, Deptford as Metropolitan Inprovements. at the cost of the ISIetropolis at large. And your Memorialists will ever pray, &c. Sealed by order of the said Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, this third day of June, 1886. (Signed,) JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. The Metropolitan Board of Works referred the said two Memorials to their Works and General Purposes Committee for consideration and report. The Vestry having had under consideration a communication received from the Metropolitan Board of Works, suggesting an amendment of the law, with the view of placing the demolition of buildings in or near public thoroughfares, under the control of that Board, also a letter received from the Vestry Clerk of St. Mary, Newington, with copy of a resolution passed by that Vestry upon the subject as follows, viz. :— "That the Metropolitan Board of Works be informed, in reply to their eommunica"tion, that the Vestry have no knowledge that any accidents iiave occurred in this "Parish from the demolition of buildings in or near public thoroughfares, and that the "Vestry, whilst offering no objection to an amendment of the law, requiring notice to "be given in ail cases of such demolition of buildings and the erection of hoardings for "the protection of the public, are of opinion that such notice should be given to the "Surveyor to the Vestry or the District Bjard, at the case may be, and not to the "District's Surveyor as suggested, and also that the Vestry further object to either tiie "Metropolitan Board or the District Surveyor being empowered to regulate the erection "of hoardings or works in such cases, believing that this duty can best be carried out "by the Local Authority for the District ; it was Resolved, that this Vestry approve of and support the views of the Vestry of Newington, as expressed in their said resolution, and that the Clerk be instructed to reply to the letter of the Metropolitan Board of Works upon the subject in accordance therewith. The boundaries of the Parish were perambulated 011 Holy Thiusday, 3rd June, 1886, and the Vestry granted a sum of £22 towards the expenses of such perambulation. The Vestry in June, 1886, appointed a special Committee, consisting ot the following gentlemen, viz. :—Messrs. John Bulmer, Lawrence Stevens, Henry Hay ward, Walter Beasley, and Francis John Bisley, to confer with the Churchwardens and Overseers of this Parish as to the irregularity of the amount in the pound ot the London 24 School Board Rate in this and other Parishes in the Metropolis. The Committee reported that having conferred with the Churchwardens and Overseers, and heard their explanation, are of opinion that the irregularity in the School Board Rate, arises from fact of the precept being based upon the rateable value without-allowing for compounded and empty properties j and that such irregulaiity must exist until the piecept be m&de upon a three years average of the actual collectable value ; it was Resolved, that the report of the special Committee be adopted. The Vestry having had under consideration a letter received from the Vestry Clerk of St. Ceorge, Hanover Square, as to the annoyance caused by the noisy hawking of Newspapers, Fruit, and other goods for sale in the streets on Sundays ; it was Resolved, that this Vestry support the action taken by the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, in the matter, and that the attention of the Police Authorities be called thereto, with the view to their taking steps to have the annoyance complained of, moderated. The Vestry subsequently received a communication from the Assistant Commissioner of Police on the subject in reply, stating, "The course adopted since the passing "of the Sunday Observation Prosecution Act, 1871, (34 & 35, Vic., cap. 87,) as far as "the Metropolitan Police practice is affected, is for the Commissioners to give written "consent, under the Act, to Local Boards or Vestries, when applied for, to prosecute any "particular persons, (which the Commissioner has been advised is necessary to the "validity of the consent.) for an offence under the Act, 29th Charles the 2nd, c. 7 ; and "all prosecutions must be instituted within ten days after the commission of the offence, "it is to be observed that the itinerant sellers of fruit, vegetables, or newspapers, on "Sundays, in the absence of any local Act, cannot be effectually prosecuted, but so far "as relates to the disturbance of divine worship, Police remonstrance, (always made if "suggested by the clergyman or Churchwardens or other officials,) has often been "found effectual." In December, 1886, the Vestry passed a resolution as follows, viz. : — Resolved, that the Inspector be instructed to keep the whole space of the footpath in the public way, Deptford Lower Road, clear from the ground upwards, and m the event of any obstruction taking place in the free use thereof by the public, he be authorised to take proceedings against the parties so offending ; and that a notice be printed and posted throughout the parish, calling attention to the necessity of the public pavement being kept clear. The Vestry having had under consideration a letter, received from the Clerk to the Vestryof St. Martin-in-the- Fields, with copy of a resolution passed by that Vestry as follows:— "Resolved, that the School Board lor London be informed that the Vestry having "been led to believe that it is the intention of the Board to promote a Bill in Parliament, "to obtain powers for the purpose of making superannuation allowances to their officers, 25 "the Vestry are of opinion that the scheme, if it became law, would entail on "succeeding generations the burden of maintaining a very large number of dependents, "while it would fail to commend itself to the Board's Officers; and the Vestry are further "of opinion that the most effective method of administering the "Elementary Education "Acts," has not hitherto been adopted, and that pending the consideration of the Report "prepared by Mr. Matthew Arnold, with the view of materially altering and improving "the present system, and the consequent readjustment of work performed by and the "salaries paid to the Board's Officers, it is impolitic at the present time, to enact a "superannuation scheme," it was Resolved, that this Vestry agree with the views of the Vestry of St. Martin-io-theFields, as expressed in the said resolution. The Vestry having had under consideration a letter received from the Clerk to the Vestry of St. James, Westminster, with copy of a resolution passed by that Vestry as follows, viz :— "That this Vestry most respectfully protests against the School Board for London "filling up the vacancy on the Board caused by the death of Mr. James Ross, a represen"tative of Westminster, by the election of a candidate who is utterly unknown to the "Electors of the Division, and in no way acquainted with local requirements, especially as "such candidate was nominated by a Member for Chelsea, and seconded by a Member for "Marylebone, while two Members for Westminster proposed and seconded a local "candidate, who obtained such support at the last election that he would now be a "member of the Board but for the operation of the cumulative system of voting." "That inasmuch as the School Board for London have in filling up the recent "vacancy utterly ignored the desires of the Ratepayers of Westminster, the Education "Department be asked to introduce a Bill into Parliament next session, providing tor the "tilling up of casual vacancies on the Board, by direct Elections by the Ratepayers of the "Division in which such vacancy has occurred, instead of by the Board itself," it was Resolved, that this Vestry co-operate with the Vestry of St. James, Westminster, in support of the views as set forth in the said resolution. The Vestry having had under consideration a letter received from the Vestry Clerk of St. Anne, Limehouse, with copy resolution passed by the Limehouse Select Vestry to the effect "That the present law providing for the rating of public Companies upon "their profits instead of upon the value of premises occupied by them, is unjust to private "traders and other ratepayers and should be amended ;" it was Resolved, that this Vestry concur with the said resolution. The Vestry having had under consideration a letter received from the Clerk to the Guardians of Chelsea, with copy of a resolution passed by the Guardians as follows, viz :— 26 "That the Guardians of Chelsea are dissatisfied with the Managers of the "Metropolitan Asylums District in not issuing an Annual Report of their proceedings, "although asked so to do on several occasions, and would respectfully request that the "Managers will see their way to prepare and distribute a report of their proceedings, "with a detailed statement of Accounts and a Balance Sheet, for the separate institutions "and General Management, up to the end of the last financial year without further "delay ;" it was Resolved, that this Vestry agree with the said resolution and that the Clerk be instructed to address a letter to the Malingers of the Metropolitan Asylums District to that effect. The Vestry having had under consideration a letter received from the Clerk to the Board of Works for the Plumstead district, with copy of a memorial presented by that Board to the Local Government Board, praying for a reconsideration of the basis on which the Metropolitan common fund is distributed, and asking this Vestry to cooperate with the Board in the matter ; it was Resolved, that a reply be sent to the said letters to the effect that this Vestry agree with the Board of Works for the Plumstead District upon the broad basis of the equalization of the Poor Rate of the Metropolis by extending the common fund to every item of expenditure. The Vestry having had under consideration communications received from The Metropolitan Board of Works, The Corporation of the City of London, and several Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis upon the one subject of the continuance of the Coal and Wine Dues, on the 1st February, 1887 they passed a resolution as follows, viz :— Resolved, that this Vestry agree with the views of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Corporation of the City of London, for the continuation of the Coal and Wine duties, and that a memorial be presented to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in favour of the continuation of such duties, also that the Clerk be instructed to write Col. Hamilton, M.P., requesting him to support the proposal of the Board and the Corporation. A Memorial was accordingly presented to the Chancellor of the Exchequer as follows :— Coal and Wine Dues. Memorial in Favour. The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the County o Surrey, to the Right Honourable G. J. Goschen, Chancellor of the Exchequer. Sheweth— 27 That your Memorialists are the Local Authority (under the Metropolis Management Act) for the Parliamentary Borough of Rotherliithe, containing a population of 12 200 and property of the gross annual value as fixed by the Valuation Metropolis) Act of £255,696. That on the 1st day of February, 1887, your Memorialists passed a Resolution in favour of the continuance of the Coal and Wine Dues as follows : — That this Vestry agree with the views of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Corporation of the City of London, for the continuation of the Coal and Wine Duties, and that a Memorial be presented to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in favour of the continuation of such duties ; also that the Clerk be instructed to write Col. Hamilton, M.P., requesting him to support the proposal of the Board and the Corporation. Your Memorialists earnestly hope that Her Majesty's Government will assist the Metropolitan Board of Works and the City Corporation in passing a Bill for the continuance of the Coal and Wine Dues. And your Memorialists will ever pray. The Common Seal of the Vestry of tho Parish of Rotherliithe, in the County of Surrey, affixed hereto by Order. (Signed) JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. The Vestry subsequently received the following communications :— Thkasury Chambers, Whitehall, S.W. 9th February, 1887. Sir, Mr. Goschen desires me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, forwarding a Memorial from the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherliithe, in favour of the continuance of the Coal and Wine Dues.

It will give me much pleasure to support the request therein made. I am, James J. Stokes, Esq., Yours faithfully, Rotherliithe. (Signed) C. E. HAMILION. 28 The Vestry having had under consideration a letter received from the Vestry Clerk of St. Mary, Islington, calling attention to the re-introduction of the ''Hyde Park Corner (New Streets) Bill," the object of which was to cast a moiety of the cost of the maintenance of Streets stated to form part of the Parishes of Sf. Martin-in-the-Fields, and St. George, Hanover Square, upon the other Parishes of the Metropolis, and stating the Vestry of Islington had resolved to petition against the Bill ; it was Resolved, that this Vestry support the action taken by the Vestry of Islington in the matter.
