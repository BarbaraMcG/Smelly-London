Telephones:— TIDeway 1288. TIDeway 1360. June, 1963. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the privilege to present the Annual Report on the health of the Borough for the year 1962. There was an increase in the population of 760, the first increase recorded since 1950. The Birth Rate has increased from 20.02 to 23.02, and the Illegitimate Birth Rate has also increased in parallel. The Infant Mortality Rate has declined to the satisfactory figure of 17.63 although, with comparatively few annual deaths, this rate can fluctuate over a wide range and a general average for several years is a more reliable index of infant well being. There were 13 more deaths this year, heart disease, particularly, angina pectoris and coronary disease accounting for 113 deaths as opposed to 66 last year. Mention has been made in previous reports of the increase in deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchitis, and this national trend has normally been reflected faithfully in our local figures. This year, however, although bronchitis deaths are about the same, lung cancer deaths are down by six, which is the lowest figure recorded since 1952, and it is hoped that anti-smoking exhortations and continued progress in the clean air programme will contribute to further improvements. As far as Infectious Diseases are concerned this was a non-measles year and the notified cases are reduced from 1553 to 259. There were 72 cases of dysentery, which occasioned much work in the collection and bacteriological examination of clinical specimens. At the beginning of the year a case of smallpox occurred in an adjoining borough and special arrangements had to be made for the vaccination of large numbers of the general public. Most of the vaccination was undertaken at London County Council clinics, and close liaison was maintained with the Divisional Medical Officer about vaccination policy and advice to the public generally. Vaccination facilities were also made available at the Town Hall for staff and members of the public. In this incident mass vaccination was not considered necessary but it was felt that, for purposes of mora 1e, no citizen should be refused vaccination if requested, and in the event, arrangements went smoothly and with little disruption. There was a case of typhoid contracted by a child while on holiday in Spain, but, apart from precautionary surveillance of close relatives, no further action was indicated. One case of anthrax was also reported. It is now 50 years since the first Municipal Health Dispensary was opened in Deptford particularly to deal with the large number of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis which were coming to the notice of the Health Department as a result of pulmonary tuberculosis becoming a notifiable disease. In 1913, the first complete year after the new tuberculosis regulations were made, there were 716 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis 2 and 170 other tuberculous diseases. In this year under review there were only 87 pulmonary and 7 non-pulmonary cases notified, most of which were of comparative mildness. The old dispensary was eventually replaced in 1928 by the present modern and well-equipped building at Harton Street which is now in the charge of Dr. Rigby, who, as usual, has made a valuable contribution to this report, for which I extend my thanks. Dr. Rigby stresses that the main focus of serious communicable tuberculosis is found in Carrington House, and I am appreciative of the efforts which he and his staff make in difficult circumstances to persuade an essentially itinerant population to accept long-term treatment and observation. He has also made some observations on anti-smoking clinics and, although I am a firm advocate of non-smoking and resent the powerful propaganda by the tobacco companies with their vast resources, I remain unconvinced about the permanent effectiveness of anti-smoking clinics. A trifling number of smokers are reached and the eventual recidivist rate, according to the results of the small number of trials publicised, is high. It seems to me that strong efforts should be directed at the schoolchildren and adolescents, and confirmed adult smokers, having been presented with the facts, must make a choice. Lung cancer is not a communicable disease, the individual is not a danger to the community, and admonitions and so-called psychotherapy only act as an irritant or induce the impressionable into neurotic patterns. The work in connection with the welfare of elderly persons has further expanded and, in anticipation of powers being conferred on Borough Councils to provide meals and recreation for elderly persons, plans are being completed to assume our new responsibilities directly, although it is hoped that the many voluntary organisations at present engaged on valuable work will continue to prosper. The laundry facilities continue to be used to the full and there has been a further increase in the number of baths given to the aged infirm in their homes and at the Bathing Centre The problem of clean air has also received attention and the third Smoke Control Area came into operation and two further areas were surveyed. At our present rate of progress the target date of 1970 for Deptford to be smokeless should be reached. Mention was made in last year's report of the number of houses which were being acquired and let out in multiple occupation; standards were falling and it was essential that efforts be made to compel owners of properties to limit numbers in occupation and to provide decent, civilised amenities. In this connection the Council adopted certain recommended standards in relation to basic amenities which will ensure, when they are applied uniformly, reasonable accommodation throughout the Borough and will undoubtedly have the eventual effect of raising the general level of amenity in the Borough, as well as preventing the gross overcrowding and squalor which is found in many other unfortunate boroughs who were faced with these problems a little earlier than Deptford. The Council has appointed a Housing Officer whose duties are concerned solely with housing matters, and already a pilot survey has indicated, in general terms, the extent of the problem. The Council is determined, and rightly so, not to allow this Borough to degenerate into a vast slum. I said last year that slums are not Deptford's main problem, but 3 scent property which is in urgent need of renovation or conversion to modern standards. Next year it may be possible to report in some detail the strong efforts which are being made towards this aim. In conclusion it is always a pleasure to extend to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman my thanks for their support, and I am glad to record my appreciation to all members of the staff for their loyalty and their efforts. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STAFF Medical Officer of Health J. Kerr Brown, b.sc., m.b., ch.b., d.p.h. Public Analyst (part time) H.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar-General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0.98 and for deaths 1.01 and the birth rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated increase in the population is 760, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 781. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table. I The deaths are classified under 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948. Area of Borough 1,564 acres. Estimated mid-year home population 68,980 Live Births—Legitimate 1,375 Illegitimate 213 1,588 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 living population 23.02 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births 13.41% Still Births—Legitimate 22 Illegitimate 2 24 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 (live and still births.) 14.89 Total Live and Still Births 1,612 Infant Deaths—Legitimate 22 Illegitimate 6 28 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births— total 17.63 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births— legitimate 16.00 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births— illegitimate 28.17 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births (first four weeks) 13.85 Early Neo-natal Mortality Rate (Deaths under one week per 1,000 live births) 11.96 Perinatal Mortality Rate (Still births and deaths under one week combined 1,000 live and still births) 26.67 Maternal Deaths (including abortion) 1 Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births 0.62 Total Deaths 807 Death Rate (per 1,000 living) 11.69 Section " B " INFECTIOUS DISEASES 8 INFECTIOUS DISEASES General The total number of notifiable infectious diseases showed a decrease of 1,294 from the previous year. This decrease is mainly accounted for by the decline in Measles notifications, only 121 against 1,400 in 1961. Smallpox In the early part of the year the incidence of some cases of smallpox in London led to a demand for vaccination, particularly from people who proposed to travel abroad. Special arrangements for clinics for the general public were made by the London County Council and supplies of vaccine were made available to the New Cross General Hospital in order that the vaccinal state of the staff could be brought up to date. The staffs of two factories in the Borough that deal in rags were vaccinated and also the members of the Borough Council staff who come into contact with the public. Anthrax The one case of Anthrax concerned a man who had been employed in the Surrey Commercial Docks unloading lambs' wool. Typhoid Fever This notification was in respect of a small boy who had been on holiday with his parents in Spain. The cause of the illness was presumed to be Ice Cream which had been consumed by the child whilst abroad. Dysentery There was an increase in the number of cases of Sonne dysentery occurring during the year. 72 cases were notified as against 23 in 1961. Infectious Diseases.

No cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis, diphtheria or ophthalmia neonatorum were notified during the year. 9 Tuberculosis Fifty years ago the first Order was made by means of which all cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis had to be notified to the Medical Officer of Health. For some three years previously this disease was notifiable but only in the case of Poor Law patients and later in 1912 the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1912, consolidated, amended and simplified the machinery for stamping out all forms of tuberculosis, both pulmonary and other forms. It was in this year, 1912, that the Deptford Municipal Tuberculosis Dispensary was opened at 78, Amersham Vale and the dispensary work continued there until 1928 when it was transferred, together with other health services to the Harton Street Health Centre. It is interesting to note that in the first year of notification of all cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis 436 cases were notified and 148 deaths. This total of deaths represented the highest individual total of deaths from defined diseases in that year. In 1962 there were 81 new notifications but only 5 deaths. From about 1948 the whole building at Harton Street was devoted entirely to tuberculosis and other chest conditions and is now known as the Deptford Chest Clinic under Dr. J. P. V. Rigby whose report for the year appears hereunder. Tuberculosis Register Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F Total M F Total Cases notified for the first time 58 23 81 4 3 7 Posthumous notifications 2 -- 2 - - -- New cases in Borough coming to knowledge otherwise than by primary notification 33 18 51 1 1 2 I am indebted to the Chest Physician, Dr. J. P. V. Rigby, for the following report concerning the Chest Clinic at Harton Street, which is of great interest:— Cases on Chest Clinic Register at 31.12.62:— Definite 1,076 Observation 26 Number of new contacts examined 281 Total attendance at the Chest Clinic 5,758 TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE Interviews by Secretary 785 Cases assisted by Care Committee 19 Sums raised by Christmas Seal Sale, 1962 £39 16s. 4d. 10 "It will be noted that the total attendances are well maintained and the Deptford Chest Clinic remains a busy hive of industry. No less than 1,234 new cases attended for investigation during the year 1962. This, of course, involves a good deal of work and compares well with the number of new Out-Patients seen in the medical departments of local general hospitals. This will give some measure of the activity concerned here. The main source of gross active pulmonary tuberculosis remains Carrington House with its floating population of males, and the follow-up of these cases often taxes the ingenuity of my staff, but the degree of success is relatively high, possibly due to the nearness of the chest clinic to Carrington House. I believe there is some likelihood of the Deptford Chest Clinic being moved into the new Greenwich District Hospital at a later date, and one wonders whether the follow up of such cases will be made less easy by such a move and whether, in fact, patients from Brockley and New Cross attending here will find the move a convenient one. In the past the policy has been to segregate chest patients from others for infective reasons. Careful note is being taken of the smoking habits of the local populace attending the clinic, and a small investigation is in progress. A small service is also being started here for excessive tobacco smokers and their special problems in relation to chest diseases. That these persons are exposing themselves to the risk of lung cancer is now no longer a mere possibility. A fairly large number of patients attending the clinic were investigated with this possibility in mind. Over the last few years the average number of cases of cancer of the lung found here has been one per fortnight." Mass Miniature Radiography I append below a report which I have received from the Director of the Mass Radiography Unit: "I have pleasure in enclosing as requested figures for work carried out in Deptford during 1962. You will note that nineteen cases of significant tuberculosis were discovered, seven of whom were resident at Carrington House. These latter were found among 130 examined there, and it appears that the incidence in that group remains very high. It is interesting to note that among a total of 3,581 not previously examined, the incidence is 3.9 per thousand including Carrington House, and 2.6 per thousand with this group excluded. The public surveys in side roads near New Cross Gate and Deptford High Street produced seven cases of tuberculosis, of which four men and two women had not been previously examined, giving an incidence of 3.8 and 2.2 per thousand respectively. It seems that the time has not yet arrived when this type of survey becomes unproductive, and that efforts to reach the unexamined part of the population should be continued". 11 Analysis of Results of Survey carried out at Deptford during the Year 1962 (including general public, factories and colleges) General Analysis Men Women Total Part I (a) Total X-rayed 5,361 3,263 8,624 (b) Total previously mass X-rayed within five years 3,254 1,789 5,043 (c) Total reviewed (considered possibly abnormal at first reading) 269 119 388 (d) Considered abnormal after review 203 78 281 (e) Failed to attend for large film 2 1 3 Part II (1) Cases considered tuberculous and referred for further investigation: (a) No further action required - - - (b) Occasional supervision 6 5 11 (c) Requiring close supervision or treatment 15 4 19 (d) Still under investigation 2 3 5 (e) Refused further investigation 1 - 1 (2) Previously known tuberculous cases 11 3 14 (3) Non-tuberculosis cases: (a) Investigated 44 20 64 (b) Still under investigation 3 - 3 (c) failed to attend 2 - 2 (4) Cardio vascular lesions 14 18 32 (5) Abnormalities requiring no action 105 25 130 Section "C" SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES ETC., AND FACTORIES ACT 14 SANITARY INSPECTION General The total number of primary inspections carried out by the district public health inspectors rose from 4,256 in 1961 to 4,366. Complaints continued to fall, the total number received being 1,107 against 1,178 in the previous year. During the year an effort was made to deal with the question of houses in multiple occupation and inspections of known houses were carried out during the summer. Late in the year one of the Public Health Inspectors (Mr. White) was detached from district duties and appointed Housing Inspector, with the main object of inspection and treatment of houses in multiple occupation, of which we have a large number. This detachment of a district Inspector from a district staff already depleted by the appointment of a Clean Air Officer meant that the districts had to be enlarged and inevitably often only urgent matters could be dealt with to the detriment of routine inspection. At the end of the year, in spite of several advertisements we were still short of establishment of Public Health Inspectors. Two student inspectors are employed and, together with a member of the clerical staff, are under training for the Public Health Inspectors' examination and it is hoped that one will qualify next year. Defects found were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, the London County Councial (General Powers) Acts and the London County Council Bye-laws. Rodent Control Two rodent operators were employed throughout the year under the general direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector, and the following tables summarise the work carried out:— 15 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1961 Type of Property Non-Agricultural (1) Local Authority (2) Dwelling Houses (including Council Houses) (3) All other (including business premises) (4) Total of Cols.

Any other points of interest:— Primary visits by Public Health Inspectors 162 Re-visits by Public Health Inspectors 440 A high proportion of business premises in the Borough have their own contracts with private service companies for the control and destruction of rats and mice. This largely accounts for the smallness of the figure relating to business premises. 18 Disinfection and Cleansing The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing:— Disinfestations. Premises 315 Rooms 338 Articles 15,561 Disinfections. Premises 212 Rooms 75 Articles 10,517 Library Books 18 Articles Destroyed 529 There was a small amount of disinfection carried out for a local firm who required bags to be steam disinfected before export and an amount of £8 15s. 0d. was received in respect of this service. Bathing Station Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 110 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies and impetigo 59 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 665 Personal Hygiene treatment (Heads only) 10 Baths (Old People) Home 320 Bathing Station 908 Laundry The laundry service is for aged infirm people in the Borough, who are incontinent and who have difficulty in obtaining someone to wash and cleanse their bedclothes and personal underclothing, etc. The equipment consists of a Washing Machine, Hydro-extractor and Ironing Machine, and the work is carried out by the Bathing Station and Disinfecting staff. Number of patients 91 Number of collections and deliveries 4,066 Number of articles cleansed 42,393 These figures show an increase in the number of collections and deliveries of 8 and in the number of articles cleansed 7,784. The laundry service is working to the utmost of its present capacity and consideration is being given to the provision of additional equipment and personnel in order to increase the service. Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. 19 The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and sufficient water supply were issued in respect of 364 new premises. All dwelling houses in the Borough have water supply direct to the house and none are supplied from standpipes. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 On the 1st October, 1962, the third Smoke Control Area in the Borough came into operation. This is an area containing 200 acres and includes 2,907 dwellings, 40 industrial premises, 215 commercial undertakings and 17 others. During the early part of the year the Clean Air staff were also engaged in the inspection of houses in the proposed Nos. 4 and 4A Smoke Control Areas which were confirmed by the Minister early in 1963. Area No. 4 covers 114 acres and includes 832 houses, 47 shops, 3 Churches, 1 Church Hall, 1 Scouts Hut, 7 factories, 2 public houses, 3 petrol stations, 1 G.P.O. sorting office, 1 students hostel, and two lockup garages. Area No. 4A is a small area covering 7 blocks of flats on the Honor Oak Estate. It was intended originally to include this area in our No. 1 Area but it was decided to await action by the Lewisham Borough Council in respect of the remainder of the L.C.C. flats on this Estate. Area No. 4A consists of 192 dwellings and 8 shops. The Clean Air Officer's inspections and visits during 1962 are summarised as follows:— Smoke Control Order inspections 1,910 Smoke Observations 504 Factory Visits 851 Miscellaneous 47 3,312 A station for measuring atmospheric pollution is set up in the Public Health Department building and results and details are sent to the Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. 20 Attached is a summary of readings during the year:— Months Smoke Concentration MG/M Sulphur Dioxide Concentration MG/M Days Average Value Highest Value Lowest Value Average Value Highest Value Lowest Value January 31 229 586 48 232 991 76 February 28 199 449 88 325 583 146 March 31 238 594 85 278 571 45 April 30 93 186 3 199 498 35 May 31 77 195 13 126 335 40 June 30 62 158 21 111 355 30 July 31 57 123 20 115 271 33 August 31 39 90 6 78 205 6 September 30 59 170 6 91 228 17 October 31 174 616 36 279 779 36 November 30 244 691 96 341 975 118 December 31 355 1526 92 591 3112 144 SEWAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL Sewage disposal throughout the Borough is by means of Borough Council and London County Council Sewers and is perfectly adequate. 21 Factories Act, 1937 1.

Section "E" HOUSING 28 HOUSING At the end of 1962 the Council had 1,568 permanent houses, maisonettes and flats, and 140 temporary houses of various types. Included in the total of 1,568 are 136 properties which have been acquired by the Council and which house 208 family units. During the year, 113 flats and maisonettes were completed for the Council. Also, 1,693 improvements were carried out in 556 houses, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 110. Apart from the flats completed by the Council, 237 flats were completed by the London County Council, and 14 houses by private builders. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1962:— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 1,152 Number of Statutory Notices served 174 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 556 HOUSING ACT, 1957 Closing Orders on basement rooms of one house were made by the Council. HOUSING ACT, 1961 The Public Health Committee during the year spent a considerable amount of time in dealing with the requirements of the Housing Act, 1961, and the Regulations made thereunder, and in June the Council adopted a standard regarding the amenities which should be required in houses in multiple occupation viz: (a) Natural and Artificial Lighting Natural. (i) The provision and maintenance in every habitable room, of a window or windows (capable of being opened at the top), opening directly to the external air and having, where practicable, a glass area equal to at least one-tenth of the floor area. (ii) The provision and maintenance, wherever practicable, of adequate means of natural light to a common staircase. Artificial. There shall be provided and maintained suitable means for securing adequate artificial lighting either by electricity or gas in each habitable room, bathroom and water-closet. (Staircase lighting is already dealt with under Bye-laws.) 29 (b) Ventilation The provision and maintenance of adequate means of ventilation, including permanent ventilation, for every passage, room, water closet apartment and staircase. (c) Water Supply (i) The provision of one tap per floor and, if more than one letting, one tap inside each letting. In each case the provision of a sink of suitable size and pattern and efficient means for carrying off any waste water from the tap. (ii) The provision in every hostel, boarding house, guest house and boarding school, of a water supply reasonably accessible to the occupants of each sleeping room. In addition to the requirements of the Metropolitan Water Board Bye-law No. 24(1950) relating to the provision of a stop tap for each separately chargeable supply, it is suggested that a stop tap should be fitted for each floor or each separate letting, whichever is the more convenient. (d) Personal Washing Facilities In each letting there shall be provided a hot and cold water supply at a wash-hand basin or at a sink. There shall also be provided in connection with each letting a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom with hot and cold water. Where it is impracticable for the bathroom to be within the dwelling, it shall be in such a position within the curtilage of the building as to be readily accessible from the dwelling. In such cases, wherever practicable, regard shall be had to the mention in the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular 16/62 of a suggested scale of provision of 2 baths or 1 bath and 1 shower per 10 persons. In any event, the minimum provision shall be in the ratio of one fixed bath or shower to ten persons irrespective of age. (e) Drainage and Sanitary Conveniences In all cases regard shall be had to the mention in the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular 16/62 of a suggested scale of provision of 2 W.C.s per 10 persons, but if this cannot be attained then:— (i) If practicable, the provision and maintenance of 1 water closet for every 4 habitable rooms, or 1 water closet for every 8 person irrespective of age, existing accommodation is to be deemed insufficient if it fails to conform to both of these requirements, or if it is not reasonably accessible to the persons for whom it is intended; except in the case of: (ii) hostels, boarding houses and similar establishments where 1 water closet for every 8 persons, sited so as to be conveniently accessible in relation to sleeping rooms, shall be deemed sufficient; and 30 (iii) boarding schools, where a standard of one water closet for every 5 pupils, as laid down in the Standards for School Premises Regulations, 1959, should be borne in mind; and (iv) future conversion to single room lettings, where 1 water closet for every 4 lettings and not more than one floor distant shall be required; and (v) existing single room lettings where, if practicable, there must be a provision of 1 water closet for every 4 lettings or for every 8 persons irrespective of age, the accommodation to be deemed insufficient if it fails to conform to both of these requirements. (f) Facilities for the storage and preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of waste water The provision inside each separate dwelling (as distinct from a staircase or landing in common use) of adequate facilities for cooking food, and a food cupboard ventilated to the external air and of dimensions not less than:— One-room dwelling 3 cu. ft. A two-room dwelling 4 cu. ft. A three-room dwelling 6 cu. ft. A dwelling comprising more than 3 rooms 8 cu. ft. (These requirements relate to separate dwellings in family occupation. In the case of bed-sitting rooms in use as bachelor apartments, facilities for storing, preparing and cooking food are normally not necessary, and in such circumstances these provisions will not be required.) (g) Installations for space heating or for the use of space heating appliances In each dwelling there shall be provided an adequate number of appliances for space heating and/or suitable points to which gas or electric space heating appliances can be attached. These standards may appear to be idealistic or ambitious, but it may be pointed out that they are approaching the standards desired where Discretionary or Standard Grants are given. It may well be that in some instances they may be impracticable or even unenforceable in the Courts, and where this proves to be the case, clearly some alternative will have to be accepted. It must be remembered, however, that many of these premises are now freed from rent control and that the substantial rents charged in many cases merit the provision of adequate facilities which the increased income could reasonably finance. It is clear from both official memoranda and from Parliamentary debates that it is the Government's intention that there should be flexibility in the requirements of the Local Authority in regard to services and amenities in multi-occupied houses. It is therefore suggested that any case where special circumstances might justify a modification of the foregoing standards should receive individual consideration by the Local Authority. 31 During the year a "pilot" survey of houses in multiple occupation was carried out by the district Inspectors and a report submitted to the Committee. In view of the various problems it was decided that one Inspector should be responsible for this important section of housing inspection and Mr. J. A. G. White a district Public Health Inspector, was detached from those duties and appointed whole time Housing Inspector RENT ACT, 1957. During the year applications under the Act were received and dealt with as follows:— Applications by tenants for Certificates of Disrepair:— 14 (Granted 6. Undertakings given by landlords 7. Refused or withdrawn 1) Applications by landlords for Revocation of Certificates of Disrepair:— (Granted 14. Refused 7) 21 Applications by tenants for Certificates as to defects not yet remedied:— (Granted 1. Refused 1) 2 Applications by landlords for Certificates as to remedying of defects:— (Granted 9. Refused 2) 11 Section "F" PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES 34 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES (London County Council) The headquarters of the Divisional Medical Officer (Dr. F. R. Waldron) are at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street, S.E.8, and the services which are provided by the London County Council at the various clinics are as follows:— Health Centre, Amersham Road, S.E.14. Infant Welfare, Toddlers, and Ante-Natal Clinics. Artificial Sunlight, Simple Massage and Exercises Clinic Special Investigation (Children) Clinic. Foot Clinic. Day Nursery, Mothercraft (Educational Sessions). Vaccination and Immunisation. St. Luke's Hall, Gosterwood Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare Clinic. Princess Louise Institute, Hales Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare Clinic. St. John's Nurses' Home, Watson Street, S.E.8. Ante-natal Clinic. School Treatment Centre, Reginald Square, S.E.8 Dental Clinic. Speech Therapy. Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic. Orthoptic Vision Clinic. Minor Ailments Clinic. Mental Health Service The L.C.C. Divisional Mental Welfare Officer is at 74 Deptford High Street, S.E.8. Home Nursing The Home Nursing Service in the Borough is carried out by the Nursing Sisters of St. John the Divine, St. John's Home, Watson Street, S.E.8 and the Ranyard Nurses, Head Office, 110 Kennington Road, S.E.I1. Welfare Foods Service National Welfare Food items are available for issue at the Health Centre, Amersham Road, the Princess Louise Institute Clinic and the St. Luke's Hall Clinic at certain times. These items are also available at 74 Deptford High Street, S.E.8 and the Women's Voluntary Services, 302 New Cross Road, S.E.14. Home Help Service The Deptford Home Help Service office is at 74, Deptford High Street. Section "G" MISCELLANEOUS 36 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection. Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service Food samples are usually sent to the Medical Research Laboratory at County Hall, but clinical items, e.g., faeces specimens, continue to be sent to the Park Hospital Laboratories. The facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, are occasionally used by general practitioners for the examination of swabs and other specimens. Mortuary The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, greatly increased. The total number of bodies received during 1962 was 620, of which 284 were received from Greenwich, and 240 from Woolwich. A fee of £1 1s. 0d. per body is paid by the Greenwich and Woolwich Borough Councils in respect of these admissions. National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. 37 Ten persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1962. Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for procuring the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. Several cases were removed either to hospital or County Council homes for the aged after persuasion, but it was not necessary to invoke Section 47 during the year. Services for Old People During the year two lady visitors were engaged in visiting the old people and dealing with their health and welfare problems. 670 individual old people were visited and these are mainly old folk to whom the attention of the Department has been drawn in one way or another, e.g. medical practitioners, district nurses, home help organisations, etc. Close co-operation is maintained with the Deptford Old Peoples Welfare Association in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of visits. A total number of 5,123 visits were paid during the year (Miss Ellison 2,116, Miss Smith 3,001, an increase of 1,519 over the previous year. (Miss Ellison left in September to take up a similar post at Woolwich.) During the year 908 old people were bathed in their homes and 320 at the Bathing Station. One hundred old people on our register died during the year and a further 98 were admitted to hospitals or homes, or were transferred to other organisations for visiting. At the end of the year 472 people were on the active list of our visitors. The laundry service for the aged and incontinent was greatly improved during the year and details of the service are shown in the Laundry section of Section "C" of this Report. The Voluntary Services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five "Darby and Joan" Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the district. In addition, the Albany Institute Old Peoples Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly by Deptford people. A "Meals on Wheels" service is carried out in co-operation with the Women's Voluntary Services Organisation. Meals are provided to over 300 old people each week. The meals are obtained from a local restaurant at a cost of 2/- per meal, for which the individuals pay 1/- and the London County Council pay a subsidy of 1/- per meal. During the year a lunch club was inaugurated by the W.V.S. and this venture proved a great success. It is hoped that this service will be extended during 1963. The Deptford Borough Council maintains three vehicles and provides two part-time drivers to deliver meals to house-bound old folk and the remainder of the meals to "Darby and Joan" clubs. The W.V.S. provide 'the helpers for the delivery of meals 38 Shops Act, 1950 In the course of their routine inspection the Public Health Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of "break-point" chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At the baths at Ilderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act Seven applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council and granted. Medical Examinations During the year 46 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme. Forty-two examinations of sick employees were also made during the year and reports submitted thereon. Registration of Hairdressers' Premises Sixty-six premises are registered under Section 18(1) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. Occasional inspections are made to ensure that the bye-laws are observed. Vaccination Certificates One thousand four hundred and twenty seven certificates by Medical Practitioners in respect of people travelling abroad were authenticated. 39 Conferences The Council was represented at Conferences during the year as follows: Royal Society for Promotion of Health—Scarborough The Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor R. S. Marriott, J.P.). National Society for Clean Air—Harrogate Councillor J. F. W. Waldon; Mr. J. E. Waring, Public Health Inspector (Clean Air Officer). Public Health Inspectors' Association—Southport The Chairman of the Public Health Committee; Mr. H. E. Green, Chief Public Health Inspector. Royal Institute of Public Health & Hygiene—Eastbourne. Councillor F. J. Keep and the Medical Officer of Health.
