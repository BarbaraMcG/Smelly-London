REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD FOR THE YEAR, 1879-80 and REPORTS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER, ANALYST, AND SURVEYOR; Also Accounts in Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board during the same period. Printed in accordance with section 198 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, (18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120,) and ordered to be circulated among the Inhabitants of the District. The Thames River (Prevention of Floods) Bill has become law, it having received the Royal assent on the 11th of August last. The provisions of the Act are thus described by the Metropolitan Board of Works, its promoters, in the Report of that Board just issued. Thames River (Prevention of Floods) Bill. All works necessary to prevent the overflow of the Thames within the Metropolis are to be done by the owners of premises in accordance with plans to be prepared or approved by the Metropolitan Board. A plan is to be prepared by that Board as soon as may be after the passing of the Act, showing the line of the flood works immediately necessary; and when the plan has been prepared, notice of the fact is to be sent to the local authorities of all the districts in which such works are required, and to all owners of premises who have to do them, together with a copy of so much of the plan as concerns them, and any other information that Board may think proper. The parties to whom such notice and 4 plan are sent, are to be called upon to state within twenty-eight days whether they intend to do the works to the Metropolitan Board's satisfaction, or what objections they have. Any objections are to be considered and determined on by the Metropolitan Board. If within twenty-eight days after the receipt of the notice and plan, or of the order made by the Metropolitan Board after the consideration of any objections, the parties liable neglect to begin the works, or to give notice that they intend to do them, or if they fail to cany on or complete the works when begun, with all reasonable despatch and to the Metropolitan Board's satisfaction, then that Board may cause the works to be done, and may enter upon the premises and do everything necessary for the purpose, recovering the expenses from the parties liable. The bodies and persons required to raise the banks or other defences are also required to maintain and repair them, and if any alteration is made to any bank without authority, the person making the alteration is liable to a penalty. Any person claiming compensation for damage caused by any works under the Act, or in respect of any lands, or any interest in lands, taken or used for the purposes of, or injuriously affected by, works under the Act, may claim such compensation from the Metropolitan Board; and if the claimant and that Board do not agree, then the validity of the claim and the amount of compensation payable, may, on the application of either party, be determined by a standing Arbitrator, to be appointed by the Secretary of State : such standing Arbitrator to be appointed before the 31 st December, 1879, and to hold his office for three years. At the end of every three years a fresh appointment is to be made. Where any sum is payable to the Metropolitan Board by any owner of premises for works done by the Metropolitan Board under the Act in his behalf, it is provided that the Board shall, if required by the owner, accept payment of the same by half-yearly instalments of such amount as will be sufficient to discharge the same, with interest at live per cent., in thirty years from the date when such sum shall have become payable. The Act contains various subsidiary provisions, and it directs that from and after its passing, so much of the 69th and 70th 5 sections of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, as makes it the duty of the Vestries and District Boards to cause the river banks or defences in their respective districts to he raised, strengthened, or repaired, shall cease to be in force. The Metropolitan Board has referred it to a Committee to prepare a plan as required by the Act, showing the line and level of the flood works immediately necessary, and a list of the owners and others liable to provide for the execution of the works. The Secretary of State for the Home Department has appointed Mr. Edmund James Smith to be the standing Arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of the Act. The Improvements, mentioned in the last Annual Report of this Board, at Mr. Stidder's premises on the east side of Little Guildford Street, and at Mr. Heath's premises on the south side of Orange Street, have been completed at a cost of £200 and £90 respectively, of which the Metropolitan Board of "Works has contributed one-half. Improvements Arrangements have been made with the owner of the "Horse and Groom" public-house and two adjoining shops, situate on the south side of Great Guildford Street, and also with Mr. Henry Goodwin, the owner of premises at the corner of Holland Street and Gravel Lane, for setting back the same respectively on being compensated for so doing at the rate of 10s. 6d. per foot super, for the land to be given up. It is expected that the Metropolitan Board will likewise in each of these cases contribute a moiety of the cost of the improvement. An improvement has also been carried out, without expense to this Board, by the owner of premises at the entrance into Moss Alley from Park Street, on rebuilding the same; he having, in consideration of being permitted to build over, removed an old wooden structure which stood on the east side of the entrance, thereby widening the opening or mouth of the alley. In accordance with an application made by the Postmaster General to the Metropolitan Board of Works and transmitted tc this Board, and on the recommendation of this Board, an alteratior has been made in the name of the thoroughfare, late King Street, Borough, and in that of Church Street and John Street, Christ- Street Nomenclature. 6 church; those names being of very frequent occurrence in the Metropolis, and much inconvenience occasioned thereby. King Street has been named Newcomen Street, S.E., the Schools founded by Mrs. Newcomen being situate therein; and the two Streets above referred to in Christchurch, constituting one thoroughfare, have been named Burrell Street, S.E., a name suggested by the Metropolitan Board as one not already in use in the Metropolis. Old Stone. In November last this Board accepted an offer made by Messrs. Mowlem & Co., for disposal to this Board of the greater part of the Stone forming the carriage-way of Blackfriars Bridge (including the block channelling), at the price of 9s. per yard super., and the following Streets have been paved therewith, viz:—Broadwall; north end of Bear Lane; Winchester Street; part of Little Winchester Street; and part of Stoney Street, at a cost of about £2,396. The result of so doing will be advantageous to the ratepayers, as the far greater cost of new stone would otherwise have had shortly to be incurred. site of County Gaol. The Prison in Horsemonger Lane having been abolished by Act of Parliament and the site cleared, this Board, in November last, memorialized the Justices of the Peace for the County of Surrey praying that steps might be taken for securing the dedication of the site as an open space for the recreation of the Public. The Justices, however, declined to accede to the request, and submitted the property for sale by public auction. The biddings proving insufficient, the same was not sold, and thereupon this Board deeming it desirable in the interests of the public that the site should be secured (if possible) for the purpose suggested, renewed its endeavours by memorializing the Metropolitan Board of Works to exercise its powers in negotiating for the purchase and dedication of the land. Such Memorial has been referred to the Works and General Purposes Committee of that Board for consideration, and the Committee are now in communication with the Justices upon the subject. Artizans' Dwellings Acts. The Artizans' Dwellings Act, 1875, having in its operation resulted in a very serious loss to the ratepayers of the Metropolis, this Board, at the request of the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, uppointed delegates to attend a Conference upon the subject, viz:— 7 Mr. Albert Boulden and Mr. John Evans; and, as a result of the representations which have been made from time to time to the Metropolitan Board, that Board has determined not to prepare any more improvement schemes until further experience shall have been gained of the working of the Amendment Act of 1869. Numerous Conferences have been held at St. Martin's Yestry Hall on the important question of Water Supply, and Messrs. Hale and Rideal, the delegates appointed by this Board last year, have been unremitting in the attention which they have given thereto, and in watching the progress of the Bill introduced by the late Government. A Select Committee of the House of Commons is now sitting and taking evidence with a view to legislation upon the subject. Water Supply. The term of office for which Mr. Charles Harris was elected as a Member of the Metropolitan Board of Works expiring by effluxion of time on the 9th instant, this Board has unanimously re-elected him as its representative for the ensuing three years. Representation of Board. The loan of £2,000, negotiated in the year 1870 with the Provident Clerks' Life Assurance Association for paving works in the Blackfriars Road, has been paid off by annual instalments of £200, the last of which became due on the 22nd instant. Loan.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you the Statistical Tables recording the number of Births and Deaths in the District for the year 1879 together with such other Sanitary information as is required from me as your Officer of Health. The registered number of deaths which occurred in Christ Church was 415, and in St. Saviour 364, making a total of 779 deaths. The total number or births was 1,021, comprised in the following details:— Christ Church Males 269 Females 235 504 St. Saviour's Males 271 Females 246 517 1,021 The deaths in Christ Church Workhouse amount to 117. It is necessary to explain that this high rate of mortality is caused by its being occupied by aged and infirm men, who are drafted there from other Parishes of the Union. Of the total number who died, 76 were between 60 and 80 years of age, and 17 between 80 and 90. The following is a statement of all the deaths which occurred from various causes during the year. 10 CHRIST CHURCH. DISEASES. 6 months ended june 80, 1879. 6 months ended, dec. 31, 1879. total.

And in the parish of St. Saviour, measles 13, diphtheria 1, whooping cough 11, diarrhoea 10, syphilis 3, croup 1, remittent fever 1, scarlatina 21, typhoid fever 3,—total 64. Thirty-seven cases of scarlet fever, four of typhoid fever, and forty-five of small-pox have been removed to the Fever and Smallpox Hospitals at Stockwell, Fulham, and Deptford. Three deaths occurred from scarlet fever, and two from smallpox. All the cases were promptly removed from their homes as soon as information was obtained of the existence of the diseases, and thorough disinfection of the habitations and of every article of bed-furniture likely to convey infection was practised. In six instances the whole of the bed-furniture was destroyed, it being impossible to disinfect it thoroughly. All articles destroyed were replaced by your Board. In two instances only, was any opposition offered on the part of the friends of the sick to their removal. In one I was able to induce them to accede to the removal by persuasion, in the other I was compelled to obtain the aid of the Magistrate at the Southwark Police Court. « It is remarkable that no death from small-pox was registered in the district during the year. Several cases of scarlet fever have occurred in Peabody Buildings, in Southwark Street. This block of Buildings is occupied by over eleven hundred persons, more than four hundred of whom are children. 12 In every instance as soon as I received intimation of the existence of the fever, I caused the patient to be removed to the Hospital, and took every possible precaution to hinder the spreading of the disease by thoroughly disinfecting the rooms and bedfurniture. The subject of Hospital accomodation for persons suffering from infectious diseases has engaged the attention of the various Vestries and District Boards during the last two years, and at the several meetings which have been held it was almost universally felt that the Metropolitan Asylums Board should take charge of such cases. I am happy to say that your Board has passed a resolution to enter into contract with the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, for the treatment of non-pauper cases of infectious disease. Thus, persons so Created will come under the Sanitary Act of 18GG, and the charges for patients sent into the Hospitals will be bourne upon the General Rate, and the recipients of relief will not be pauperized. I am happy, however, to take this opportunity of testifying to the cordial support I have invariably received from the Guardians and Relieving Officers, whereby I have been enabled as readily to remove persons of the non-pauper class as those that were. In Christ Church there were 10 deaths from violence, and 18 in St. Saviour. 20 inquests were held in Christ Church, and 21 in St. Saviour. Twenty-five bodies have been removed to the Mortuary during the year. A large proportion were persons who had been drowned and found in the River Thames. In the following tabulated statement I would direct your attention to the ages of those who died during the year, 13 PARISH OF CHRISTCHURCH.—Population at Census, 1871, 14,573.

The total number of complaints of nuisances attended to, and of sanitary work effected, was less than the year preceding; but the number of houses, and of articles disinfected was increased, a larger number of infectious diseases having been prevalent during the later period of the year. Water supply. The examinations of the water of the Lambeth and Southwark and Vauxhall Companies show that it has been of fair quality, and the supply has been abundant. As I have advocated in former reports, there is urgent necessity that a constant supply in lieu of intermittent service should be afforded. Gas Examination. The average illuminating power of the Gas supplied by the Phoenix Company, as tested by Letheby's Photometer, according to the requirements of the Metropolis Gas Act, was equal to 15.4 Sperm Candles. The highest illuminating power was equal to 16, and the lowest to 14.8 Candles. The Gas Company have raised the illuminating power of the Gas to 16 Sperm Candles during the last half of the year. The proportion of Ammonia in the Gas has never reached the prescribed quantity of 2.5 grains for 100 cubic feet of Gas. Sulphuretted Hydrogen was never detected. In conclusion, I have to thank the Board and its Officers for their earnest co-operation in carrying out the Sanitary Works of the past year. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT BIANCHI. 25, Stamford Street, June, 1880. 18 PUBLIC ANALYST'S REPORT. TO THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT BOARD OF WORKS. Gentlemen, During the year that is passed, I have examined 111 articles, besides 16 in duplicate, making 127 in all. Of this number, 49 have been Milks. I have examined a larger number than I at first intended; but, in the last quarter, when milk should have been at its best, there has been an increase from 10 to 36 per cent. in adulteration by water. In all other respects there has been a maintenance in the improvement which I have pointed out in previous reports. In several cases where the admixture with water has amounted to 5 or 6 per cent, the sending for a further sample has almost always worked a cure. As far as this District is concerned, there is no reason for altering the standards accepted by the Society of Public Analysts; they were based, as far as milk was concerned upon some 20,000 analyses, and the care with which these standards were fixed, is justified by the results. "With reference to skimming, the habit seems inveterate. I would venture to repeat, that unless well-to-do people will supply themselves with cream from their own milk, they generally obtain it from their poorer neighbours. The cream that is stripped is generally made up with skim-milk, and this is the chief reason why so-called fresh milk so soon sours. 19 Condensed Milks keep up their character and are unobjectionable, provided only that stale specimens are not purchased. Where mothers employ it, stale specimens should be avoided, as the sugar crystallizes out, and the composition is altered. A new kind, called "Cream Milk," made in England, is about equal to the "Anglo-Swiss," but there is no advance upon the cream, which is in no case quite up to the mark. Of eight Butters examined, two consisted almost entirely of butterinc. When honestly sold as such, at a fair price, there can be no objection to oleo-margarine. It is, indeed, a wonder that purchasers can so completely take leave of their senses of sight, taste, and smell, in some cases where the real butter is far inferior to butterine. When genuine, however nasty it may be, the butter is of the nature and quality demanded, so far as the Public Analyst can assist the public choice. A Bread and Flour, and two kinds of Buns have been examined. The buns were analysed more especially with reference to alum, which has been found by other Analysts in the North of England; I failed to detect it, or indeed anything that was objectionable. Samples of Lozenges and of Acidulated Drops do not require more than mention, as they were good of their kind. One solitary specimen of Mustard exhibited the now very common result:—a total disappearance of the once common adulteration, but also the disuse to a great extent of the black mustard. As a condiment, the mustard was sufficiently good; but, for medicinal purposes, only passable. Also, as is usual, from the mode of drying Pepper, a sample contained more sand than is essential, but there was no suspicion of adulteration. If the public would desire freedom from sand, white pepper should be used in preference. It is, however, 20 quite possible to purchase black pepper without this admixture, which generally proceeds from careless drying upon its native soil. One sample of Ketchup, with a most agreeable smell and taste of mushrooms, contained no less than 11? per cent. of common salt, showing how valuable is that condiment in its place, and how well understood its use. Sulphuric Acid has entirely disappeared from Vinegar in Tickles, and much more care is exhibited in their preparation. Lead and Copper were absent, but the sample of Red Cabbage Pickle was too fresh for present use. As to Teas, four in number, and Coffees, two, they have been found genuine. One of the teas contained many old leaves. Two of the teas, and the two coffees were very good. In the course of the twelvemonth, twelve Malt Liquors have been analysed. With regard to salt, all the samples were well under 40 grains per gallon. In the last Report, (1879), issued as to the general working of the Adulteration Act, our case was fully reported, and given as an illustration of the amount of salt which may be contained in a malt liquor arising to a great extent from the water employed. Admitting the truth of the statement, it is a curious fact that we have succeeded in lowering the quantity of chlorides in beer. One of the Beers was of extraordinary quality. It contained an amount of sediment equal to 1/8 of the bulk of the liquor, consisting mainly of yeast and vinegar-fungus, and literally swarming with Bacteriæ. The sample was quite sour and undrinkable within 24 hours. Under the amended Act, Spirits have been again brought under the notice of the Public Analyst. I have examined Gin, Whiskey, Rum, and Brandy; all of them have passed the ordeal. Drugs, four in number, conclude the series. There was this 21 peculiarity in one of them. A Tartar Emetic, otherwise almost perfect in composition, contained a very distinct amount of arsenic. It may not be generally known that arsenic can take the place of antimony in tartar emetic. In this case the antimonious oxide must have contained the arsenious oxide, and thus was its presence accounted for. As the quantity of tartar emetic taken medicinally is very small, and consequently also that of arsenic in this preparation, there was only need to point it out to the Vendor. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS. Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital Medical and Surgical College, S.E.
