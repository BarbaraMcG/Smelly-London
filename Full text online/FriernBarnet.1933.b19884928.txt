C.I. AC 439(3) FRIERN BARNET FRI43 FRIERN BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31st DECEMBER, 1933. To the Chairman and Members of the Friern Barnet Urban District Council. Mrs. Bailey and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report on the Health Conditions in the Urban District of Friern Barnet during the year ending 31st December, 1933. The Report Is drawn up in accordance with Circular 1346, issued by the Ministry of Health in October 1933. During the year, the Clearance Area resolution was passed respecting the houses scheduled as such in the South Ward, but after the inquiry held by the Ministry of Health, the resolution was not confirmed., In consequence it will not be possible to carry out the scheme of clearing the poorly built and worn out houses, on that part of the South Ward, known as the Freehold. The houses are being reconditioned in accordance with the undertakings given by the owners at the Enquiry. Further improvements to the Sewage Works have also been completed during the year. It is satisfactory to note that the decline in the incidence of Scarlet Fever noted last year has been fairly well maintained, the rate being 2.4 as against 2.3 the year before, and 3.7 during year prior to that. As was pointed out last year, these figures tend to shew that no increase in infectious disease is occurring in spite of a continued effort to cause all cases to be nursed at home wherever possible. With regard to Measles, there have been only one third the number of cases notified during 1933 as during 1932. The Death Rate during the year has increased by 1.6 per 1000, but from the tables it will be seen that the increase, has occurred largely in the older age groups, and was accounted for by an increase in deaths from Heart diseases, which, it would appear have not been favoured by the weather during the year. I am, Mrs. Bailey and Gentlemen, Your Obedient servant, M.B., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health. (2) STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area in Aires 1304.09 Population Census 1932 - 23081.

Population. North Ward 3366 6850 South Ward 3529 7400 Central Ward 3750 6800 Mental Hospital 2900 10645 23950 The Registrar Generals estimate of population is 23990. (3). BIRTHS. The number registered in the district was 199, and the number assigned to the district by the Registrar General 299, and this gives a birth-rate of 12.5. The Infantile Mortality rate is calculated on the number of births assigned to the district by the Registrar General. The still-births during the year numbered only 5. This remains fairly low, being 16.6 per 1000 births, against 9.4 per 1000 births in 1932, and 26.0 per 1000 in 1931. DEATHS. Table 2 shows in detail the registered causes of death in alphabetical order, their distribution in wards, and particulars of the inward and outward transfers. The number of nett deaths was 217, giving a crude death-rate of 9.1 per 1000. Since the preparation of the Death-Table, the Registrar has assigned 217 deaths to the district, and this will give the corrected death-rate for comparative purposes as 10.0 per 1000. The infant mortality rate is 57 per 1000 births. Affections of the Heart and Circulatory system continues to be the principal cause of deaths there being an increase of 20 deaths as compared with 1932. Cancer was again the cause of many deaths in persons over the age of 45, and Influenza c.nd Pneumonia caused a considerable number of deaths during the winter months in elderly persons. The deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis have increased slightly, and it is interesting to compare the death-rates each year for the past ten years from this cause. 1924 1925 1925 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 0.68 0.66 0.29 0.34 0.47 0.41 0.21 0.47 0.39 0.57 There was only 1 death from Diarrhoeal diseases.

Nursing in the Home Three Nursing Associations operate within the district, each having a whole time nurse - Those operating in the North and South Wards have a working arrangement with the Council for the home visiting of cases of Measles, the cost thereof being met by the Councils Mldwives. The Middlesex County Council is the supervising Authority. Laboratory facilities. These remain the same as in previous years, Hospitals. The agreement for Friern Barnet- to become one of the Authorities comprising the Hornsey, Finchley and Wood Green Joint Hospital Board has made substantial progress, Southgate has agreed to terminate the arrangement tor the use of 12 beds at their Isolation Hospital at Palmers Green, as from September 1934, after which date, this district will be' served by the Hospital at Coppetts Road, Muswell Hill, adjoining the southern boundary of the district. Maternity and Nursing Homes. The Middlesex County Council is the supervising Authority under its special Acts. Maternal Mortality. The Middlesex County Council is the Local Authority for Maternity and Child Welfare, and Hospital accommodation is available for cases of Puerperal Fever and/or Pyrexia, through the County Medical Office Ambulance facilities. (1) Infectious cases. Suitable and sufficient provision has been made for removal of infectious cases to Hospital by means of motor ambulance from the Southgate Isolation Hospital. ??? non-infectious and accident cases. The Flnchley Council intimated that they would not, be able to continue the arrangements for this district to use their Ambulance after March 31st, 1.934, and this Council has decided to make provision for an Ambulance service to be worked from the Central Fire Station after that date. (5). Tuberculosis The Middlesex County Council have a scheme for dealing with this disease throughout the County. The local dispensary is situated at "Chester Villa", High Road, N. 12. Dr. Dobson, the Tuberculosis Officer for this area has been good enough to send me the following information respecting his work on Friern Barnet residents for the year under review.- New Tubercular cases in 1933 12 fransfeis in, not inciuded in above. 1 New non-Tubercular oases including contacts 23 36 Cases supervised at or from Dispensary during 1933 (all T.B.) 62 Tubercular oases still on Register 31. 12. 33 46 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Sewage Disposal Works. The three 118 ft. diameter Rotary Percolating Filters constructed to replace the old contact beds were completed during the year, and put in operation. The Consulting Engineers have reported on the further extensions, suggested by your Engineer and Surveyor, and instructions have been given for this Scheme to be prepared. Negotiations were entered into with the East Barnet Valley Urban District Council with a view to that Authority taking the sewage from the low lying portion of this area draining to fly Place, and treating at their Works, but as this sewage would have to be lifted from their deep sump, the idea has had to be abandoned, and the Consulting Engineers have now advised that the Ely Place ejector station be modernised, enlarged, and electrically driven pumps installed replacing the ejectors and long air- main from the Sewage Works. Scavenging and disposal of refuse. The method of controlled tipping has been continued throughout the year without nuisance, I reported fully on this method of disposal in my report of 1928, and can add little to such report. Water, Rivers and Streams, Closet accommodation, Smoke Abatement, Schools, and Rag Flock Acts. 1911 and 1628. These matters were fully dealt with in the Report of 1925, and no change of note has taken place therein.

Periodical and occasional visits are paid to all shops where food is exposed for sale. The fried fish shops have modern ranges, and no complaints have been received of nuisance from this source a Meat and Fish. There has been no slaughtering in the district during the yeer. Only one licensed slaughter-house exists. I am pleased to report that there has been no need for the seizure of unsound food, and that the amount surrendered has been extremely small, only one box of Codfish, having been destroyed during the year. Milk., During the year X4 Supplementary Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designations) Order. 1923o (9) PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OYER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Scarlet Fever. There has been a slight increase in the incidence of this disease, the attack rates for the past six years being. 1928. 1929. 1930. 1931. 1932. 1933. 3.4 3.2 3.0 3.7 2.3 2.4 The disease has been of a very mild type, and the average length. of stay in Hospital "being 36 days, During the year under review 33⅓% of the oases notified were treated at home. I cannot help thinking that the prevalence of this disease is due to a great extent to its mildness, cases going unrecognised and unsuspected, but capable of conveying infection. Diphtheria. The incidence of this disease has been exceptionally low during the past year, there being only 6 cases notified against 18 in 1932„ aid 21 in 1931.The disease has however been of a rather more severe type, the average stay in Hospital being 54 days against 48 during 1932, and 33 during 1931. Typhoid Fever. Onl one case was notified during the year,and this occurred in the Mental Hospital. Puerperal Pyrexia. This case made a satisfactory recovery. Small-ox. We continue to receive Circulars from the County Medical Offr.cer giving particulars of cases of this disease notified in the County of London. One case was notified in this district as such, and was removed to Hospital, but it was shown subsequently not to have been Small-pox. Three contacts were notified as residing in this district, and were kept under observation for the necessary time. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. This case made a satisfactory recovery. Vision Unimpaired Vision Impaired Total Blindness Deaths. Notified Treated At home In hospital 1 1 - 1 - - - (10) NON-NOTIFIABLE DISEASES. Measles. Only 27 oases were notified by school teachers and others. The disease was of a mild type, and the majority of the cases occurred at the Sydney Road School. Mumps. There were no cases of Mumps notified by school teachers during the year. Chicken-pox. 24 oases were notified, and was again less prevalent than during the past few years. Whooping Cough. Only 1 case was notified, and the incidence of the disease shows a steady decline over the past few years.
