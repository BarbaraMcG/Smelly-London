To the Council of the County Borough of West Ham. Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, "Every Medical Officer of Health appointed under order of the Local Government Board is required to make an annual report with regard to the sanitary district which is under his superintendence . . . . . The report is to be for the year ending 31st December. It should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the district and with the means for improving those conditions. It should contain an account of the sanitary circumstances of the district, and of any improvement or deterioration which may have occurred during the year in those circumstances." In accordance with the above requisition, I beg to submit my annual report for the year 1904, and in doing so, desire to point out that such report must necessarily consist very largely of a summary of my periodical reports and other matters which have been under discussion by the Council during the year, and which therefore are more are less within the immediate recollection of the members. The collated returns, however, and the statement of local circumstances which may appear superfluous to members fully conversant with them, serve not only as valuable statistical records for future reference, but are needed by the Local Government Board and other authorities, to whom the Medical Officer of Health is required to forward copies. I am, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES SANDERS, Medical Officer of Health. a 2 4 METEOROLOGY. The observations given below are extracted from the weekly reports of observations taken at Greenwich Observatory, a course justified by the geographical position of the Borough immediately to the North of Greenwich. They show that the registered sunshine of the year was 1,457.2 hours, being 15.8 hours more than in 1903. The hottest day was August 4th, when the temperature reached 91'0 degrees, and the coldest day was November 26th, when it sank to 23.2 degrees. The number of rainy days was 158, the total rainfall during the year being 20.63 inches, being 3.86 inches below the average. The greatest daily fall occurred on July 25th, when 1½ inches fell.

Area.—The area of the County Borough of West Ham is 4,706 acres. Latitude 51° 30' — 51° 33' N. Longitude 0° 1' W.- 0° 3' E. Population.—The Census taken on 1st April, 1901, showed the population of the Borough to be 267,358, the number of inhabited houses to be 41,433, giving 6.4 persons per house. This number varies in the different wards, as will be seen in a later table. The estimated population for the middle of the year 1904 was 288,424. Births.—The number of births registered during the year was 9,276, being 202 less than the previous year, but 393 more than the average number during the last ten years. This makes an annual birth-rate of 32.1 per 1,000, the average birth-rate for the ten years 1894-1903 being 345. Distributed to the various wards the births were as follows :— Ward. Males. Femalea. Total. Rate per 1,000 population. New Town 256 238 494 25.1 Forest Gate 264 217 481 22.5 High Street 301 316 617 30.1 Broadway 226 212 438 25.7 Park 224 196 420 25.2 Upton 216 193 409 21.5 West Ham 571 586 1,157 34.4 Plaistow 594 574 1,168 40.6 Hudsons 463 453 916 35.1 Canning Town 550 497 1,047 40.3 Tidal Basin 593 602 1,195 37.7 Custom House and Silvertown 477 457 934 33.0 Totals. 4,735 4,541 9,276 32.1 7 Deaths.—The number of deaths registered in the Borough during the year was 3,980. This number included the following deaths in public institutions and other places in the Borough:— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Plaistow Hospital 2 86 West Ham Hospital 10 54 St. Mary's Children's Hospital 27 36 Seamen's Hospital — 42 Medical Mission Hospital — 2 Non-residents registered in the district 9 91 The 3,980 registered deaths do not include the following deaths in institutions outside the Borough:— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Union Infirmary 34 504 Borough Asylum — 123 Dagenham Hospital — — Residents registered in London Institutions. 41 254 After the suitable adjustments rendered necessary by the foregoing tables have been made, the net deaths of the Borough 8 numbered 4,836 (2,542 males and 2,294 females), being 442 more than those of the year 1903, and 174 more than the average number during the past ten years. This makes an annual death-rate of 16.7 per 1,000, or 1.7 below the average death-rate during the ten years 1894-1903, which was 18'4 per 1,000. Corrected for age and sex distribution, this death-rate becomes 17.8 per 1,000, the corrected death-rate for London during the same period being 17.4. Distributed to the various Wards, the deaths were as given in the table below, in which also are calculated the Ward death-rates. With regard to these latter, it is essential to remember that in such a shifting population as pertains in West Ham, the liability to error in estimating the population increases with each yearly advance from census year, and this liability is magnified when dealing with separate localities. The natural increase of births over deaths account for 4,440, or roughly, two-thirds of the estimated increase, and the Borough Engineer informs me that the houses finally passed for occupation during 1904 were as follows:—New Town, 4; Forest Gate, 8; High Street, 2; Broadway, 0; Park, 1; Upton, 9; West Ham, 25; Plaistow, 75; Hudsons, 279; Canning Town, 6; Tidal Basin, 237; Custom House, 81. It is, however, pure guess work to assume that the new houses contain the same average population as was discovered in census year, and the calculations founded thereon are necessarily given with caution. 9  Persons per House.

I was asked during the year to work out the percentage of deaths in Public Institutions and prepared the following table, which relates only to residents of West Ham (deaths occurring in non-residents being excluded). From this it will be seen that, taking an average, during the past five years 22 per cent. of the deaths of West Ham people occurred in one or other of the institutions named:— INSTITUTION.

The average Zymotic death-rate during the previous ten years was 4 per 1,000. As under the Notification Act some of the chief Zymotic diseases which largely account for the death-rate are for various reasons (mainly economical) not included, and as the Zymotic death-rate varies according as epidemics occur of one or other disease, it is advisable to consider the rate of each disease separately, and I append these particulars in two tables below relating respectively to Notifiable and Non-Notifiable Epidemic Disease. In the latter case I am dependent for the particulars of the number of cases of Measles and Whooping Cough, which are said to occur, to the returns of the School Attendance Officers, and while not relying on the figures as accurate results include them as a fair estimate of epidemic prevalence. In the case of Diarrhoea I get no returns. Notifiable Epidemic Disease. Disease. Notified Cases. Deaths. Attackrate. Deathrate.

Of these no less than 511 occurred during the third quarter of the year, of which 256 were males and 255 females. Distributed among the wards of the Borough the deaths vary considerably, as under:—New Town, 37; Forest Gate, 16; High Street, 36; Broadway, 24; Park, 18; Upton, 8; West Ham, 56; Plaistow, 61; Hudsons, 53; Canning Town, 57; Tidal Basin, 71; Custom House, 74. The greatest fatality from this disease always falls upon the young, especially upon those under one year of age, as will be seen from the list below, where it is shown that of the 511 total deaths 13 407 were under 12 months, 85 between one and two years old, and only 19 above two years. Deaths from Diarrhœa at various ages:— Under 1 month 11 Between 1 and 2 months 30 „ 2 „ 3 „ 37 „ 3 „ 4 „ 56 „ 4 „ 5 „ 45 ,, 5 „ 6 „ 37 „ 6 „ 7 „ 35 „ 7 „ 8 „ 39 8 „ 9 „ 42 „ 9 „ 10 „ 24 „ 10 „ 11 „ 26 „ 11 „ 12 „ 25 407 „ 1 „ 2 years 85 Over 2 years 19 Meteorological conditions have always been intimately associated with Epidemic Diarrhœa, and the chief of these conditions is temperature accompanied by diminished rainfall. In the year 1901, in reporting on the same subject, I gave a chart showing graphically the incidence of Diarrhœa during the third quarter. The incidence was not quite as heavy in that year as in 1904, but the corresponding weeks of the two years may be compared. 14 Deaths from Diarrhœa during third quarters of 1901 and 1904:— 1901. 1904.

The great majority, however, supplement the breast feeding with other articles of diet, quite unsuitable for young infants, in the mistaken belief that milk alone is insufficient. There is little doubt that such improper feeding gives rise to gastric and intestinal disturbances which renders the child unable to resist the poisonous germs which attach themselves to articles of food and the utensils in which the food is prepared. In no case, perhaps, is the main foundation of Hygiene—cleanliness- more beneficial than in connection with food, and in this connection it is regrettable when visiting to find what a large number of mothers keep their food, cooked and uncooked, soiled linen and dirty vessels, 15 a11 closely gathered together on the same table. It is true this is often due to an absence of sufficient airy storage, but too frequently the conveniences provided are not utilized. Another common failing one finds is that diminished rainfall appears to produce diminished house cleaning. People will scrub away muddy houses, but dust is not so noticeable, and that water is not as copiously used for this purpose during hot summers as it should be. A cold wet summer does not produce excessive epidemic Diarrhoea, and common sense should suggest, not only to the individual citizen, but also to the municipality, that one of the chief methods of reducing this very fatal disease is the unsparing use of water. Much good, we do not doubt, is done by the visitation of houses, more especially by the women Inspectors. Hitherto, it has been difficult to obtain information as to the existence of newly-born children, and the Council, together with other authorities, requested that a return of Births should be supplied to the Medical Officer of Health as well as of Deaths. In October, 1904, the RegistrarGeneral, after consultation with the Local Government Board, informed the Local Registrars by circular letter, that they were at liberty to furnish the Sanitary Authorities with the particulars of births on specified forms, and it is therefore now possible to reach the mothers of infants, and by distributing literature and advice to warn them against common domestic faults at a much earlier time than heretofore. In several instances, owing to the time which elapses between birth and registration, the Medical Officer of Health receives notification together both of the birth and of the death of a child. It is, however, a great aid to the administrations of a Public Health Department to obtain the knowledge of the houses where births have occurred. Truant School, Fyfield.—During the year arrangements were made for the reception into Plaistow Hospital of cases of 16 infectious disease occurring in the above school, and the Medical Officer of Health was directed to undertake such removal and subsequent disinfection. Fortunately, it has not been found necessarv to put in force these instructions. General Sanitary Administration.—The routine work which occupies most of the time of the sanitary staff will be found scheduled in various tables below and in the appendix. The Common Lodging Houses, of which there are ten, affording accommodation for 516 lodgers, have been regularly inspected. Twelve private slaughterhouses, subject to annual license by the Council and eleven registered slaughterhouses, not subject to annual renewal, have been supervised, and in some cases required notice in respect of cleansing. Plans for a new slaughterhouse in the New Town Ward, in substitution for an existing slaughterhouse, were passed by the Council, but an application to utilize the basement of premises at 631, Barking Road, was refused. Housing of Working Classes Act.—Under the above Act the Medical Officer of Health found it necessary to report only one house during the year, namely, No. 52, Church Street, West Ham. This house will be closed by the owner. Offensive Trades.- During the year permission was granted (subject to conditions) for the establishment of (1) a Soap-making business by Messrs. Rowan Brothers, in Marshgate Lane, Stratford, and (2) a Soap-making business by Mr. F. Hammcrsley, at Bradfield Road, Silvertown. In the former case the Medical Officer of Health reported that the business had been commenced without the sanction of the Council, and notice was served to discontinue. Upon subsequent application by the firm, and after a visit by the Public Health Committee to the premises, permission to establish the trade was granted. 17 Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders.—The cowsheds are kept under observation by the Men Inspectors, in whose districts the cowsheds respectively stand ; the milkshops are visited by one of the Women Inspectors. The whole of the cows throughout the Borcugi are inspected annually by the Council's Veterinary Surgeon, whose report as to their condition of health and the absence of tuberculosis of the udder during 1904 was remarkably favourable. I append a list of the cowsheds and the number of cows in June 1904:— NAME. Address. Registered Accommodation. No. of Cows.

In all 269 premises were visited, distributed among the various Wards of the Borough as follows:— New Town 24 West Ham 30 Forest Gate 24 Plaistow 25 High Street 12 Hudsons 35 Broadway 16 Canning Town 19 Park 8 Tidal Basin 21 Upton 29 Custom House and Silvertown 26 In the majority of the instances the Ice Cream was prepared and sold in connection with shop premises as an addition to retail trade in other commodities, such as confectionery, tobacco, mineral waters, &c. In only eleven instances were private premises used for the purpose of wholly supplying perambulating barrows for distribution in the streets, while in two instances Ice Cream barrows were distributing within the Borough delicacies prepared in Poplar and Stepney. In examining the premises an attempt was made to classify them according to the cleanliness exhibited in methods and means, and so far as could be judged by outward conditions as regards the interior of buildings and the utensils used, the premises resolved themselves into three groups, (a) Clean, 205; (b) Fairly Clean, 33; (c) Dirty, 31. Note was taken of sanitary defects anywhere upon the premises, such as would be included in a report of a house-to-house inspection, and dividing these into major and minor, according as the defects found were of a graver character or numerically strong on the one hand or comparatively slight on the other, it was found that out of 106 premises in which defects were apparent, 21 might be described 19 as major and 85 as minor. These have been the subject of sanitary notice, and considerable improvement effected not only with regard to structural defects, but, by advice and intimidation, in respect of the towels and water used for cleansing the glasses provided for the public, the latter probably being the chief source of contamination. Dining-rooms.—A similar systematic inspection was made of the kitchens, &c., attached to eating-houses. In all 70 premises were visited, and the methods of storage of food, treatment of refuse, cleanliness of premises, &c., enquired into. In the large majority of cases, having regard to the nature of the business, the conditions were fairly satisfactory, but in a small minority more or less serious defects were found and remedied.

Plans for a new Bakehouse for the Stratford Co-operative Society were passed, also for a new Bakehouse in Hermit Road, and a new oven fixed at 160, Boleyn Road.

I submit the following statement for the consideration of the Committee:— A.—Section 60 (4) of the Metropolitan Police Act provides as follows:— "Every person shall be liable to a penalty of not more than forty shillings who shall empty or begin to empty any privy between the hours of 6 in the morning and 12 at night, or remove along any thoroughfare any night soil, soap lees, ammoniacal liquor, or other such offensive matter between the hours of 6 in the morning and 8 in the evening, or who shall at any time use for any such purpose any cart or carriage not having a proper covering, or who shall wilfully or carelessly slop or spill any such offensive matter in the removal thereof, or who shall not carefully sweep and clean every place in which any such offensive matter shall have been placed, slopped or spilled, and in default of the apprehension of the actual offender, the owner of the cart or carriage employed for such purpose shall be deemed to be the offender. "Provided always that this enactment shall not be construed to prevent the Commissioners of any Sewers within the Metropolitan Police District or any person acting in their service, or by their direction, from emptying or removing along any thoroughfare at any time the contents of any sewer which they are authorized to cleanse or empty." 31 B.—Section 70, West Ham Corporation Act, 1888, provides as follows:— The Corporation may from time to time make and enforce bye-laws for all or any of the following purposes (that is to say):- For prescribing the times for the removal or carriage through the streets of any fæcal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid, whether such matter or liquid should be in course of removal or carriage from within or without or through the borough, and that the vessel, receptacle, cart or carriage used therefor shall be properly constructed so as to prevent the escape of any such matter or liquid, and for compelling the cleansing of any place whereon such matter or liquid shall have been dropped or spilt in such removal or carriage. C.—The Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, Section 26, contains a provision practically identical with the West Ham Act. D.—Section 16 (2), Public Health London Act, 1891, reads:— The County Council shall make bye-laws (a) for prescribing the times for the removal or carriage by road or water of any fæcal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid in or through London, and providing that the carriage or vessel used therefor shall be properly constructed and covered so as to prevent the escape of any such matter or liquid, and so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. Section 60 of the Metropolitan Police Act quoted above under A is repealed (from the Metropolis) "as from the coming into operation of any bye-law made for the like object." Under these powers the London County Council have 32 made the following bye-law which is now in force in the Metropolis:— (1) Every person who shall remove or carry by road or water in or through London any fæcal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid, whether such matter or liquid shall be in course of removal or carriage from within or without or through London, shall not remove or carry such matter or liquid in or through London except between the hours of 4 and 10 o'clock in the forenoon during the months of March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October, and except between the hours of 6 o'clock in the forenoon and 12 o'clock at noon during the months of November, December, January, and February. Such person shall use a suitable carriage or vessel properly constructed and furnished with a suitable covering so as to prevent the escape of any such matter or liquid therefrom, and so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. Provided that this bye-law shall not apply to the carriage of horse-dung manure. The principle incorporated in the above bye-law is that offensive matter should only be removed in the hours of daylight when the manner of its removal can be seen, and any matters slopped over can be at once cleared up, but as will be seen from the hours mentioned in Clause A, above, it is a complete reversal of the principle incorporated in the Metropolitan Police Act. We have, therefore, the hours of daylight enacted as the proper time for the removal of offensive matter in the Metropolis, and the hours of darkness prescribed for similar purposes in West Ham, and although, as shown under B, the Corporation can make bye-laws for these purposes, the bye-laws could not vary the hours mentioned in the Metropolitan Police Act, while that Act is still in force. 33 Public Health Committee's Report, 6th September, 1899. Clause 19. That they have had under consideration complaints of the serious nuisance caused by the carts engaged in collecting fish offal, and find that, under Section 60 of the Metropolitan Police Act, such matters may not be carried through the streets in the Borough between the hours of 6 o'clock in the morning and 8 o'clock in the evening, but that, in London, the London County Council have made a bye-law under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, prohibiting the removal of such matters through London except between 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the morning from March to October, and between 6 o'clock in the morning and 12 noon in November, December, January and February, two sets of hours being therefore in operation on the opposite sides of Bow Bridge. Both the West Ham Corporation Act, 1888, and the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, contain provisions enabling the Council to make bye-laws dealing with the matter, but, as neither of these Acts repealed Suction 60 of the Metropolitan Police Act (as the Public Health (London) Act did, so far as the Metropolis was concerned) the power is inoperative, as bye-laws cannot be made to override the Act of Parliament. Your Committee recommend that, in order to enable the Council to make bye-laws dealing with the subject, as the London County Council have done, a clause be inserted in the next Bill in Parliament, repealing Section 60 of the Metropolitan Police Act, so far as the Borough is concerned, and that in the meantime the Police Authorities be asked to more strictly enforce the provisions of their Act. C 34 West Ham Corporation Act, 1900. Section 55. As from the coming into operation of any bye-law made by the Corporation under the provisions of Section 70 of the West Ham Corporation (Improvements) Act, 1888, or of the Section 26 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, for the like object Subsection 4 of Section 60 of the 2 and 3 Victoria c. 47, shall cease to be in force within the Borough. Medical Officer of Health's Report, 21st November, 1900. Clause H. Removal of Fish Offal. The following Bye-law regulates the removal of Fish Offal in the Metropolis:— "Every person who shall remove or carry by road or water in or through London any fæcal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid, whether such matter or liquid shall be in course of removal or carriage from within or without or through London, shall not remove or carry such matter or liquid in or through London, except between the hours of 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the forenoon during the months of March, April, May, June, July, August, September and October, and except between the hours of 6 o'clock in the forenoon and 12 o'clock at noon during the months of November, December, January and February. Such person shall use a suitable carriage or vessel properly constructed and furnished with a sufficient covering, so as to prevent the escape of any such matter or liquid therefrom, and so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. 35 "Provided that this bye-law shall not apply to the carriage of horse-dung manure." The Metropolitan Police Act, 1839, which at present regulates the removal of fish offal in West Ham, renders it unlawful to remove fish offal between the hours of 6 o'clock in the morning and 8 o'clock in the evening, the consequence being that no fish offal collected in London during the winter months can pass through West Ham, and during the summer months, only between the hours of 4 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the morning. At the same time, it is lawful in West Ham to collect fish offal during the evening, which, in the summer months, gives rise to grave complaints. It is obviously ridiculous that the regulations as to the carriage of offensive matter should be diametrically opposite on the two sides of the Western boundary of the Borough. Section 55 of the West Ham Corporation Act, 1900, provides for the repeal of the provisions of the Metropolitan Police Act, specifying the above hours as from the coming into operation of any bye-laws made by the Corporation under Section 70 of the West Ham Corporation (Improvements) Act, 1888, or Section 26 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890. It would appear that the above bye-law of the London County Council, with the substitution of the word West Ham for that of London, would be a suitable bye-law for the purpose of assimilating the time in the two districts, and I recommend that such a bye-law be made under the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, instead of the West Ham Corporation Act, 1888. Public Health Committee's Report, 21st November, 1900. Clause 9. That, with reference to Clause (h) of the report of the Medical Officer of Health, they recommend that a draft of the following bye- C2 36 law be submitted to the Local Government Board, with a view to its ultimate adoption by the Council under the provisions of the Public Health Amendment Act, 1890:— "Every person who shall remove, or carry by road or water in or through the County Borough of West Ham, any fæcal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid, whether such matter or liquid shall be in course of removal or carriage from within or without or through the borough except between the hours of 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock in the forenoon. Such person shall use a suitable carriage or vessel, properly constructed and furnished with a sufficient covering so as to prevent the escape of any such matter or liquid therefrom, and so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. "Provided that this bye-law shall not apply to the carriage of horse-dung manure." Public Health Committee's Report, 5th June, 1901. Clause 22. That, with reference to Clause 9 of the report dated 21st November, 1900 (Vol. XV, page 57), recommending the adoption of the bye-laws prohibiting the removal of the fæcal, offensive, or noxious matter or liquid through the Borough, except between the hours of 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock in the forenoon, the Town Clerk submitted letters from the Local Government Board and from Messrs. Clapham, Fitch & Co., on behalf of an Association of Soapmakers, Tallow Melters, and Bone Boilers in London and West Ham, from which your Committee find that negotiations have taken place between the Local Government Board, the London County Council, and the Association of Manufacturers in question, with the result that the Local Government Board propose to sanction bye-laws for London, allowing the collection to be carried on between 7 a.m. and 2 37 p.m. all the year round, and the Board now suggested that similar hours should be adopted by the Council for West Ham. Having carefully considered the matter, and bearing in mind the very great annoyance continuously experienced in West Ham through the conveyance of fish offal along the public highways, your Committee are unable to recommend the Council to agree to insert the hours suggested by the Local Government Board in the proposed bye-laws, but are of opinion that, if the Board are not prepared to assent to the hours proposed by the Council, no bye-laws should be made, which will leave the question to be dealt with by the Metropolitan Police Act, which provides that such matter shall only be removed through the streets before 6 a.m. or after 8 p.m., and that the Police should be asked to stringently enforce the provision of their Act. Public Health Committee's Report, 4th July, 1901. Clause 24. That they have had under consideration a letter from Mr. E. Harvey Cook, with reference to the recommendation contained in Clause 22 of your Committee's report dated 5th June, 1901 (Vol. XV, pages 889 and 890), relating to the proposed bye-laws respecting the cartage of offensive matter, asking the Council (1), that words should be inserted in the bye-laws, clearly and distinctly limiting its operation to the carrying of fish offal, or (2), a proviso to the effect that the bye-law shall not apply to the systematic clearing of, and the collection of fat and bones from the shops of butchers and marine store dealers, and stating that, in the event of one of these courses being adopted, his clients would withdraw their opposition to the bye-law. Your Committee are unable to agree to the proposal of Mr. Cook, and recommend that the Council adhere to its previous resolution on the subject. 38 Public Health Committee's Report, 8th January, 1902. Clause 31. That they have had under consideration a letter from the Local Government Board adverting to the correspondence which took place some time ago with regard to the proposal to make bye-laws regulating the hours for the removal of noxious matter through the streets, in which the Local Government Board stated that the London County Council had now modified their bye-laws, and had decided to retain the hours previously in force in the Metropolis for such removal, viz.: between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. during the months of March to October inclusive, and between 6 a.m. and 12 noon during the remainder of the year, and suggesting that the Council should reconsider the matter with a view to adoption of similar hours to those now prescribed in London. Your Committee are unable to see their way to recommend the Council to adopt the suggestion of the Local Government Board, but recommend that the Council adhere to their previous resolution to leave the matter to be dealt with by the Metropolitan Police Act, which prohibits the removal except before 6 a.m. or after 8 p.m. Public Health Committee's Report, 20th January, 1904. Clause 13. That they have had under consideration a letter from the Local Government Board, enclosing for the observations of the Council a copy of a letter from Messrs. F. S. Hempleman & Co., complaining that they are suffering considerable hardship in their business as Manure Manufacturers, collecting fish waste "from hundreds of fishmongers in London" by reason of the bye-laws of the London County Council requiring that such waste shall be collected between 4 and 10 a.m. in summer, and 6 a.m. to 12 noon in winter, while in West 39 Ham the Police Act of 1839 is in force, which prohibits the removal of such offensive matter through the Borough, save between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. Your Committee have had this question under consideration on many occasions, and in 1901 the Council proposed to make bye-laws dealing with the difficulty, but inasmuch as the Local Government Board then considered that any such bye-laws should provide for the collection during the same hours as were specified for London, it was finally resolved, on the recommendation of your Committee, to abandon the proposal to make bye-laws, and to leave the matter to be dealt with under the Police Act, and the Board was so informed on the 17th January, 1902. Your Committee see no reason for recommending the Council to depart from their previous decision, as they are of opinion that it is neither necessary nor desirable that the Council should make bye-laws to supersede an enactment which protects the inhabitants of the Borough from the serious annoyance which would result from the streets being used during the busy hours of the day for the conveyance of noxious matter collected from "hundreds of fishmongers in London," and recommend that the Council adhere to their previous decision in the matter. 40 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.

The whole of the drains were submitted to smoke test under pressure and opened up for inspection near their exit from the premises, and in some cases at other points in addition. Those drains which were found not to be running clear, or which allowed escape of smoke, were subsequently dealt with by the Architect of the Education Committee. The Midwives Act, 1902.—By this Act, the object 'of which is to secure the better training and supervision of midwives by 43 the establishment of certification and enrolment of women who are properly qualified to act in that capacity, the Council of the County Borough became the Local Supervising Authority for the purpose of carrying out certain specified duties in relation to midwives. Under Section 8 of the Act the duties of the Local Supervising Authority are defined as follows:— (1) To exercise general supervision over all midwives practising within their area in accordance with the rules to be laid down under the Act. (2) To investigate charges of malpractice, negligence, or conduct on the part of any midwife practising within their area, and should a prima facia case be established to report the same to the Central Midwives Board. (3) To suspend any midwife from practice in accordance with the rules under the Act, if such suspension appears necessary in order to prevent the spread of infection. (4) To report at once to the Central Midwives Board the name of any midwife practising in their area convicted of an offence. (5) During the month of January of each year to supply the Secretary of the Central Midwives Board with the names and addresses of all midwives who, during the preceding year, have notified their intention to practice within their area, and to keep a current copy of the roll of midwives, accessible at all reasonable times for public inspection. (6) To report at once to the Central Midwives Board the death of any midwife or any change in the name or address of any midwife in their area, so that the necessary alteration may be made in the roll. 44 Under the Rules framed by the Central Midwives Board the following give directions to the Local Supervising Authority:— Rules, E. 20. The Local Supervising Authority shall make arrangements to secure a proper inspection of every midwife's case book, bag of appliances, &c., and, when thought necessary, an inspection of her place of residence, and an investigation of her mode of practice.

In carrying out Section 8 (3) of the Midwives Act, it shall be the duty of the Local Supervising Authority to suspend a midwife from practice who contravenes the directions for the use of disinfectants and for the employment of proper safeguards against the spread of infection, and any other rules for the purpose laid down by the Central Midwives Board, and in the exercise of that duty the Local Supervising Authority shall, after communicating their decision in writing to the midwife concerned, at once report any suspension (with the grounds thereof) to the Central Midwives Board. Under the provisions contained in Section 8, the Council delegated their powers and duties to the Public Health Committee, and directed the Medical Officer of Health to take all necessary steps for the proper operation of the Act and the rules made thereunder (7th October, 1903). During the year 1904, 21 midwives notified their intention to practice within the Borough. Of these, five were resident outside the area of the Borough, and as they were subject to the visitation of the officers of the County Council of Essex, it was not felt necessary to subject them to a second visit of inspection. It is incumbent on midwives under the rules to send for medical help in all cases of abortion, of illness of the patient or child, or of any abnormality occurring during pregnancy, labour, or lying-in, to keep a record of sending for medical help, and to send a copy of such record to the Local Supervising Authority. During the year I received 385 copies of such records. 45 APPENDIX. Pages. 1. Weekly Notifications of Infectious Disease 46-47 2. Weekly Admissions to Plaistow Hospital 48—50 3.
