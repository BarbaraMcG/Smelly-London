Public Health Office, Town Hall, Walworth Road. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my TwentyFifth Annual Report which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1911. The health of the inhabitants of the Borough has been good. There has been no exceptional amount, nor any outbreak in particular of infectious disease other than Diarrhsea, which was more than usually prevalent during the very hot summer months. The death-rate, calculated on the Census returns, is slightly higher this year, owing to a diminishing population and to certain clearance areas not yet reoccupied. The sanitary work, due to the many changes in the staff, has not gone on quite so regularly as in previous years. Upon the whole, good work has been done in spite of the changes referred to. I have to thank the various members of the staff for their ready assistance, and the Council and the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark 2 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS Enumerated population 1911 (unrevised figures) 191,962 Total Births in 1911 5,692 Total Deaths in 1911 3,532 Birth Bate for London, 1911 24.8 Do.

The Population of the Borough of Southwark some time during the last decade reached in all probability its highest point in regard to density. The diminution in the number of inhabitants has not been uniform throughout the Borough. The Census returns show that the northern or river side districts have suffered most in that respect. The old lament of overcrowdedness is rapidly being removed. The estimated population for 1910, was found at the last Census to have exceeded by 19,000 the actual number of our inhabitants. Some portion of this error is to be accounted for by the various clearance schemes undertaken during the last few years, in which the dislodged people have not yet returned or the areas have not yet been entirely built upon. Other agencies have been at work, such as the clearing away of debased and worn out property which have been replaced by business premises. This change in the character of the borough has been beneficial both to the health of the inhabitants remaining and the finances of the Local Authority. In regard to the death-rate, although it cannot be considered high, it is above the average death-rate for the Metropolis as a whole, and that might be expected when the class of inhabitants is taken into consideration. In the northern part casual labourers and common lodging houses abound, while in the south there is a resident population in which many of the wage earners work away from home. Large numbers of these wage earners do not come home to sleep and therefore are not numbered on the Census return, but should they become ill they come home, and if they die they are included in our mortality lists. This is the case with thousands of our people; for instance, our girls are working in situations at Hampstead and for Census purposes they belong to Hampstead, but when they are taken ill and die they belong to Southwark. This is very well for Hampstead, but it is not so satisfactory for Southwark when the death-rate is under consideration. 4 POPULATION—(continued).

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1911 was 5,408, of which 2,680 were males, and 2,728 females. This represents a birth-rate of 28.2 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered, belonging to the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 3,239; St. George the Martyr, 1,647; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 522. In addition to these 5,408 births registered in the Borough I learn from the Registrar General that there were 284 births during the year in various lying-in and other institutions outside the Borough belonging to 6 persons resident in Southwark, and this number (284) must be added to the total as above, making the actual number of births for the year 5,692, which increases the birth-rate to 29.6 per 1,000.

Of the 3,098 deaths registered in the sub-districts of the Borough, 1,228 occurred in the Poor-Law Institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 399 belonging to Southwark, and 829 to other sanitary districts. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is, outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,263. Of this very large number as many as 729 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died in the large public hospitals. The percentage of persons dying away from home in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 35.7. When those persons who were non-parishoners, but who died in our Borough have been deducted, and the outlying deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the Sanitary Area is found to be 3,532, of which number 1,905 were males, and 1,627 females. The death-rate when calculated on this "corrected" number is 18.4 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1911, as against a rate of 15.9 for 1910. TABLE 3.

County of London on September 1st, 1911. 54 PHTHISIS. The total number o£ cases of Phthisis notified daring the year under consideration was 712, of which 322 were notified by the Poor Law Medical Officers, 321 by Hospitals, and 69 by Private Practitioners. Although the number of notifications of Phthisis is increasing, it bears however, a very small proportion to the whole in the district, which must exceed 4,000. The mortality from the disease in this borough is very high and is largely to be accounted for by the poverty and distress of many of the inhabitants, especially those who are casual workers. The unclean and careless habits of our casual poor render them particularly prone to Phthisis. They are often housed in debased and illventilated rooms, mostly very verminous. Other causes are generally present such as overcrowding, insufficient food, intemperate habits and miserable surroundings. The steps taken in this borough in regard to Phthisis will be shown by the following questions and answers. Questions. Hospitals for In-treatment (in Borough aud outside). Names of hospitals, homes for the dying, and other institutions receiving in-patients suffering from tuberculosis, with number of beds provided for this purpose.

The deaths from Scarlet Fever in the borough were 6 during the year 1911, as against 9, 14, 24, 35 and 45 in the preceding five years. This small number of deaths creates a record. It is not easy to point to any one particular thing that could account for the lessened incidence of the disease during the past few years and the smaller case fatality. In regard to ward distribution the disease has been pretty uniform. There has been nothing in the way of an outbreak in any part of the borough. Of the causes of this diminution the better examination of school children and the exclusion of suspicious cases must have had a great influence upon the spread of the complaint. The cleansing of verminous rooms, the number of which has been so great during the past year, must also have had some effect. The stripping off of wall paper in the process of disinfection has also tended to increased cleanliness. In the future the direction in which the sanitary force at the disposal of the Local Authority should be applied more particularly is in the cleansing of verminous rooms, which unfortunately in poor districts are very numerous, in the ventilation and cleansing of dirty rooms, and in recommending more cleanly habits in regard to the person and clothing of the people. At the present time no one can justly complain of the houses of this borough being structurally insanitary. There must be, of course, instances of such houses in so densely populated a borough as Southwark, but the number is relatively small. Further in respect to verminous rooms, it is not always the fault of the landlord. A few well chosen cases taken against tenants would act like a charm where the landlord had done his best at much expense, and where the tenant through inattention had allowed the vermin again to accumulate. It is only reasonable to suppose that a certain amount of disease is spread by blood sucking vermin, such as bugs and fleas, and indirectly by lice. The total number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified was 480, as against 419 for 1910. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 1-2. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.03. The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— 68 In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The deaths in the 474 cases sent to hospital numbered 6, a mortality of 12 per cent. In the 6 cases treated at home, there was no death. It is our practice to spray the room with formalin and to strip the paper off the walls in the process of disinfection after Scarlet Fever. In the event of the room being verminous it is afterwards fumigated with sulphur. DIPHTHERIA. There has been a comparatively small amount of this disease in the Borough during the year. No outbreak of any importance has occurred. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 293, as against 284 for last year. The deaths from the disease numbered 30, as against 35 for 1910. 69 The percentage of deaths to the cases notified was 10.6. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.15.

The Wards most affected were Christchurch, St. Michael, and St. Mary, in the order named. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever during the year numbered 5, as against 7, 6 and 7, in the three preceding years. The total number of cases notified was 45 for the present year, and 54, 35 and 48 for the three preceding years. The percentage of deaths to the total number of cases notified was 11.1. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.02. 70 The number of cases notified during the last ten years :— 1902 193 1907 80 1903 122 1908 48 1904 92 1909 35 1905 74 1910 54 1906 111 1911 45 The number of deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years:— 1902 23 1907 11 1903 23 1908 7 1904 18 1909 6 1905 11 1910 7 1906 21 1911 5 Of the 45 cases notified as many as 43 were removed to hospital, of which 3 died, a mortality of 7 0 per cent. In the 2 cases treated at home both died. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 95.5. The Wards most affected were St. Michael, St. Mary, St. Paul and St. George, in the order named. MEASLES. This disease which was marked by such a heavy death rate in 1910, has diminished nearly by one-half during the year under consideration. Even with this decrease the number of deaths (120) stands high for what is often looked upon as a mild complaint. In well-to-do families where proper precautions are taken, a fatal issue is hardly ever heard of, but in less fortunate households the story runs very differently. Every case coming to our notice is visited and the condition of the house reported upon. Instructions are also given both verbal and by leaflet. Disinfection is carried out after a death and when notice is given to us of the recovery of a patient. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years: — 1902 164 1907 112 1903 83 1908 77 1904 191 1909 127 1905 154 1910 225 1906 95 1911 120 71 The death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.62. The Wards mostly afteeted were St. Peter, St. George, St. Jude and St. John, in the order named. WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease were 64 for the year. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.33. Deaths from Whooping Cough for the last ten years:— 1902 114 1907 103 1903 68 1908 50 1904 118 1909 57 1905 80 1910 60 1906 54 1911 64 361 cases of Whooping Cough were notified to the Medical Officer of Health from the Schools. CEREBRO SPINAL FEYER. During the year three cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever were notified, of which two died. DIARRHEA. The year under consideration illustrates the swing of the pendulum in regard to the mortality from Diarrhsea. For the last four years there has been a marked diminution in the number of deaths, ranging from 225 in 1906, to 90 in 1910. The pendulum last year (1911) swung in the opposite direction. The season will be remembered as an exceptionally hot one during the whole of the summer months. August as usual was a very fatal month for infants, and the prevalent disease was Diarrhsea. In regard to the action taken by the Sanitary staff, it can be said that every case was visited and the premises reported upon. Instructions and leaflets were also given to the parents. This work was carried out by Male Inspectors. I had intended to employ a woman inspector for this work, but owing to the action of the Council in deciding otherwise this had to be abandoned. Women inspectors are better suited for making inquiries and giving instructions in children's complaints. In the case of every birth, instructions " How to feed the baby •' are sent, in which breast feeding is advocated. We find that breast feeding the baby on the ground alone of economy, is the usual practice in this borough. Directions to the number usually of 10,000, are distributed at the houses in the poorer parts of the district calling attention to the "Precautions to be taken to prevent Summer Diarrhsea." 72 The annual death-rate from Diarrhsea per 1,000 living was 1.72. Deaths from diarrhaia during the last ten years:— 1902 169 1907 101 1903 197 1908 188 1904 282 1909 113 1905 183 1910 90 1906 225 1911 331 TYPHUS FEYER. No death occurred from this disease during the year, and no case was notified. Infantile Diseases Notified from the Schools. Notifications under Form 84 by School Officers. The following numbers were received, viz-:— Whooping Cough 361, Measles 1274, Mumps 370, Chicken-pox 442, Diphtheria 223, Scarlet Fever 389, Enteric Fever 17, German Measles 21, Cerebro-spinal Fever 3, Sore Throat 7, Scabies 86, Impetigo 27, Eczema 35, Ringworm 206, Conjunctivitis 28, Purulent Ophthalmia 101, and Erys'pelas 22. Health Work and Notification of Births Act. 1907. From the commencement of June up to the end of the year Miss Wilkinson carried out the duty of visiting houses in the borough from which births had been notified, giving advice, and, where necessary, leaving printed instructions as to the care and feeding of infants, &c. During the seven months, the inspector made 1,403 original visits and 1,320 revisits in connection with births She also made 54 visits in relation to cases of Ophthalmia and other infantile diseases.

During the year, 155 persons were cleansed at the Station in King James Street, as against 713 persons during the year 1910. The diminution in the total number of persons cleansed is owing to the fact that the agreement between the London County Council and this Council as to payment for the cleansing of school children was not completed until the end of 1911. The cleansing of school children had in the meantime been suspended. 18 children from the various schools were cleansed as against 600 in 1910. 137 adults were dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, as against 130 in 1910.

Proceedings were taken during the year against two persons for exposing or depositing for the purpose of sale food which was found to be unsound. The following are particulars of the cases in question:— (1) Jack Garrett, exposing for sale at No. 20 Deacon Street an ox cheek which was diseased and unfit for human food. Fined £5 and 4s costs. The following report is taken from a newspaper. (2) " Under Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, Sidney John Kilby of Deacon Street, Walworth, was summoned before Mr. Hopkins to answer the complaint of the Southwark Borough Council that there was found deposited on his premises for the purpose of sale a large quantity of condensed milk, some tins of potted meat, fish and fruit, and six pots of jam which were intended for food and which were unsound and unwholesome. Mr. G. C. Topham, Solicitor to the Council, said the total weight of the goods seized was 27 cwts. On May 24th, Inspector Fisher visited the defendant's premises, a general grocery store, and in the back yard saw a number of cases of condensed milk which the defendant said were intended for pigs' food. At the top of the cellar the inspector found other cases of milk. The next day the inspector again visited the premises and found that the latter cases had been removed into the yard and that on one of them there was a piece of paper on which was written " This milk is intended for pigs' food." In the cellar the Inspector found some more cases of condensed milk, seventeen tins of potted meat, twenty-one tins of herrings, five tins of salmon, four tins of fruit and six pots of jam. An examination showed the contents of the tins to be unwholesome and unfit for food, and an order for the destruction of the goods seized by the inspector was afterwards made at this court. "Evidence was given by Inspectors Fisher and Grist, and Doctor George Millson, Medical Officer of Health for Southwark. 118 "Mr. Percy Robinson, who defended, cross-examined the witnesses with the view of showing that condensed milk was used for pigs' food, and that the defendant was accustomed to selling it for that purpose. The learned gentleman elicited that numerous samples of food had been taken at the defendant's shop, but that there had been no complaint against him. "Addressing the Court for the defence, Mr. Robinson said the question here was not whether this food was fit for human consumption. It obviously was not, and it was not intended for that purpose. It was not suggested by the prosecution that the food was exposed for sale. The defendant bought up bankrupt stocks. When such purchases were made it was not possible to examine the goods closely and they had to be gone through afterwards. He thought the court would come to the conclusion that the food was deposited, not for the purposes of sale, but for the purpose of being sorted out. It was no more an offence for the defendant to have bad food in his cellar than for his worship's cook to have in the larder some fish which might have gone wrong. "The defendant was called and said none of the goods seized was intended for human food. "The defendant was under examination when the further bearing was adjourned At the adjourned hearing Mr. Hopkins (the Magistrate) ordered the defendant to pay a penalty of £50 and £5 5s. costs. 119 WATER SUPPLY.

The following is a return of what has been done under the above Act. There has been much difficulty in finding all the parties having an interest in the various properties, and in some cases we have had to start afresh. Various mistakes, naturally, in such an important Act, have been made and rectified. There is a good field in this borough for work in connection with it, although it is only fair to mention that during the last few years large portions of the borough through private and official improvement schemes have undergone remarkable changes. I have only to mention the clearances in relation to the Clandon Estate of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the Webber Row and King's Bench Walk Areas, the schemes for the clearance of the Tabard Street and Grotto Place Areas, the rebuilding and improvement of many private estates, together with the modernising of a large number of existing buildings. With the exception of the Clandon Street Area the greater part of the changes have been, naturally, in the older and worn out part of the borough—the northern end. With all this activity in rebuilding and modernising buildings and areas we have at the present time, especially near the river bank, a large number of worn out and rotten houses that must in the near future be cleared away. Some of them in construction date back to a period two or three hundred years ago. They are picturesque and interesting to the Antiquarian, but they are very insanitary. We know all this debased and undesirable property very well, and it is only fair to say that during the last few years it has received proper attention at the hands of the sanitary inspectors. I could not pass a higher compliment on the zeal of the inspectors than to simply state that there is hardly a house in the borough which is not visited and fully reported upon once a year ; indeed many of the houses are visited much more frequently. A visit to any part of the borough will testify to the value of our inspectors. I mention this as at times there is a tendency to disparage the work done by a painstaking and plodding sanitary inspector. Our inhabitants are certainly not neglected, and I believe generally appreciate our efforts on their behalf, although here and there dirty and untidy persons resent interference with their personal liberty. Everyone in this borough is visited when he is born and when he dies. Inquiries are made about his welfare when he has infectious disease, his food is carefully examined when it arrives at the river bank and from inland. We try to keep his house in a healthy and sweet condition by periodic visiting, and, when necessary, we kill his vermin for him and bath his children. This is only a small number of the blessings showered upon our inhabitants. 122 123 TABLE 53. Action taken in Southwark under the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909. Folio.

The Local Government Board's inquiry into the above clearance schemes took place on 26th April, 1911, and three following days. The schemes in the early part of the present year were finally accepted by the Local Government Board and an Order made for the clearance and reconstruction of the Areas. The following report on the subject is taken from the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the County of London:— "During the year the Council decided to proceed with an important scheme for the clearance of three unhealthy areas known as the Tabard Street and Grotto Place areas, Southwark, and the Crosby Row area, Bermondsey, which were the subject of official representations under Part I. of the Act of 1890, by the District Medical Officers of Health. The areas, which comprise about 16½ acres, are larger than the area dealt with under any clearance scheme yet undertaken by the Council or the late Metropolitan Eoard of Works. The Tabard Street Area as represented is about 13½ acres in extent, contains 619 houses, and has a population of 3,552 persons, nearly all of whom are persons of the working class. The area is situated between Long Lane and Great Dover Street and is in two detached sections lying north and south of the London County Council School in Westcott Street. The characteristic feature of the area is the narrowness of the streets and the bad arrangement of both streets and houses. George Court is, in parts, only 3 ft. wide; Little Britian, 5 ft.; Wickham Court, 7½ ft.; and several other streets do not exceed 10 ft. in width including footways. Out of 32 streets in the area no less than 13 are culs de sac. The houses in Tabard Street are three storeys in height, but nearly all the other houses on the area consist of two storeys and contain either two or four rooms. The houses generally are worn out; the walls of many of the ground floor rooms present evidence of dampness or have been matchboarded in such a way as to conceal the dampness; and the staircases are, in a number of instances, narrow, dark and dangerous. The yards of some of the houses are at a much lower level than the houses themselves and are approached by narrow, dark staircases. These yards are very small and very little sunlight 147 and fresh air can reach them. The whole of the area is populated by a very poor class, many of the inhabitants occupying cheap furnished rooms. The Grotto Place area, which comprises some 1½ acres, lies to the west of Southwark Bridge Road, and includes a number of badly arranged courts most of which are culs de sac, and some houses in Great Suffolk Street. The area contains 138 houses, all of which, except those fronting on Great Suffolk Street, are one or two storeys in height. The houses with few exceptions are quite worn out, and the inhabitants, who number 567, are of the poorer class. The Crosby Row area, which is situated on the eastern side of Crosby Row between Snowsfields and Long Lane, Bermondsey, is is about one acre in extent and contains 88 houses occupied by 474 persons, most of whom are very poor. The houses in Crosby Row are two and three storeys in height and a few have basements. Nearly all the other houses on the area are two storeys in height and contain two, three and four rooms. These latter houses are situated in courts approached either by narrow archways or passageways from Crosby Row. The courts are some feet below the level of the pavement of Crosby Row. The houses generally are worn out, are surrounded by high buildings, and have insufficient space about them. Many of them show signs of dampness or are matchboarded in such a way as to conceal the dampness. The average yearly death rate from all causes of mortality in the Tabard Street area during the five years 1904-8, was 36.8 per thousand, or more than twice that of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark, which was, in the same period, considerably above that of London as a whole. The death rate from phthisis in the area was nearly twice that of the borough and nearly three times that of London. The death rate from the principal epidemic diseases was more than two-and-a-half times that of the borough and more than three-and-a-half times that of London. The Grotto Place and Crosby Row areas are small for the calculation of reliable death rates, but the figures obtained show that in the former area the death rate from all causes was more than twice, that from phthisis more than three times, and that from the principal epidemic diseases nearly one-and-a-half times that of Southwark. The death rate from all causes in the Crosby Row area 148 was more than one-and-a-half times, and that from phthisis nearly one-and-a-half times, and that from epidemic diseases more than two-and-a-half times the corresponding death rate of Bermondsey. The Council was greatly impressed with the necessity for drastic action being taken to remedy the evil conditions prevailing, and on 8th November, 1910, it decided to make an improvement scheme under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, in respect of all three areas. The Grotto Place and Crosby Eow areas were the subject of official representations in 1899 and 1904, and although the Council had then felt a difficulty in dealing with these areas separately on account of their limited size, it was thought that if a scheme was proceeded with for the clearance of the larger (Tabard Street) area the opportunity should be taken of reconstructing the two smaller areas at the same time. As regards the limits of the scheme, the only departure which it was found necessary to make from the exact areas described in the official representations was the inclusion of certain property on the north side of Staple Street to enable that thoroughfare to be widened to 40 ft. This had the effect of increasing the population of the Tabard Street area to 3,596 persons. The numbers of persons of the working class occupying the houses on the three areas are as follows:—Tabard Street, 3,517; Grotto Place, 567; Crosby Row, 468; or 4,552 in all. In order to decide the amount of accommodation which the Council should provide on the areas themselves for rehousing the persons who would be displaced, inquiries were made to ascertain the number of vacant working class rooms in the neighbourhood. These inquiries were made within a radius of approximately one mile from Tabard Street on the south side of the Thames, the district covered including the whole of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark and about one-half of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. The total number of houses and tenements found to let in the whole area was 1,784, containing 5,977 rooms, of which 1,807 may be described as in good condition and 3,707 as in fair condition. The total number of empty rooms, viz:—4,764 in Southwark, and 1,213 in Bermondsey, is equivalent to about 5 per cent. and 3.5 per cent. of empties respectively, and there is apparently vacant accommodation in the vicinity of Tabard Street for a larger number of persons than will be displaced from the represented areas. 149 The demand for accommodation in block dwellings in London is decreasing, and there is no very great demand for tenements in the ordinary block dwellings in the neighbourhood of the Tabard Street area. This, no doubt, is largely due to the general outward movement of London population, and with increasing facilities for cheap and rapid locomotion, this migration from the crowded central districts is likely to continue. It is now quite possible for a working man to obtain more and better accommodation in the suburbs at rents which are low enough to enable him to bear the cost of travelling to and from his work at no greater, or very little additional expense, for house accommodation and travelling together, than he would have to pay for house accommodation alone in or near the commercial centres. In all the circumstances, and particularly in view of the large amount of vacant accommodation in Southwark and Bermondsey, the Council thought that it would be inadvisable to erect new dwellings on the cleared sites sufficient to rehouse all the people who would be displaced, as a building scheme in this district on such a large scale would probably be attended with unfavourable financial results owing to the difficulty in letting the tenements. The Council considered it desirable however, that accommodation for a substantial number should be provided on the area of displacement; and in determining the amount of such accommodation regard was paid to the number of persons whose occupations rendered it unlikely that they could remove to any great distance from their present homes. Having considered the question from all points of view, the Council arrived at the conclusion that the requirements of the case would be met by erecting dwellings on the Tabard Street area to accommodate 2,450 persons. There is great need for additional public open space in the locality, and it was therefore decided that the central portion of the Tabard Street area, about 5 acres in extent, should be laid out as a public open space, and that the requisite rehousing accommodation should be provided in five storey balcony block dwellings overlooking the open space which would, however, be open to the road on two sides. It is anticipated that dwellings so favourably situated will readily let. The remainder of the Tabard Street area, comprising about 3 acres, and the whole of the two smaller areas will be utilised for commercial purposes. The street widenings and extensions for which provision has been made in the scheme may briefly be described as follows:— 150 Roads will be formed on each side of the open space; two of these will be new streets, and two will consist of widenings of Tabard Street and Pardoner Street. The road on the north side of the open space will be continued in an easterly direction so as to provide through communication between Long Lane and Tabard Street. Staple Street will be widened, and Globe Street will also be widened between Tabard Street and Violet Place. On the detached (southern) portion of the Tabard Street area, Little Hunter Street, Tabard Street, Law Street and Lansdowne Place, will be widened, and the last mentioned thoroughfare will be continued to meet Little Hunter Street. On the Grotto Place area a new road will be constructed so as to form a continuation of Lant Street and emerging into Great Suffolk Street at King's Court, about 50 yards north of Sturge Street. On the Crosby Row area, Crosby Row and Snowsfields will be widened within the limits of the area, and a new road will be formed from Crosby Row on the site of Porlock Place. All the new streets will be made 40 feet wide and the existing roads, where widened, will be made of the same width The gross cost of the scheme is estimated at £473,300, and the net cost, after deducting the estimated value of the surplus lands and rehousing sites, at £387,700. The erection of new dwellings to accommodate. 2,450 persons as proposed will involve additional expenditure approximately estimated at £116,375. The date fixed for the holding of the Local Government Board inquiry into the scheme was 26th April, 1911." 151 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST PLAGUE. In view of a possible outbreak of the disease among rats, a careful inspection was made of the whole of the wharves, warehouses and. riverside property in the borough, and certain dead rats were bacteriologically examined, with a negative result. The inspectors engaged in this work had the ready co-operation of the wharfingers, and although no evidence \va6 found of rat infection, it was very good and useful practice should an invasion of plague occur. It is well to place on record the following report made to the Public Health Committee:— I have to report that Dr. Reece, one of the Medical Officers of the Local Government Board, called upon me on the 21st ultimo in reference to the measures to be taken under the Order of the Local Government Board, dated November 10th, 1910. He informed me that in more than one district of the Metropolis large numbers of rats had been found affected by Plague, and that it was highly necessary a campaign should be entered upon and actively carried on for the destruction of rats, especially in the wharves and warehouses on the river banks. He referred to the memorandum on plague by Dr. Newsholme, Medical Officer of the Board. Dr. Reece suggested that inquiries should be made to discover if excessive morbidity or mortality existed among rats at the present time, or among domesticated animals. He also drew attention to the power under the Order to appoint, if thought necessary, an officer to superintend the work of destroying rats. He thought that the Borough Engineer, Sanitary Inspectors, Sewerman and other similar officials should asssist in the work. Dr. Reece advised that when excessive sickness or mortality among rats was found, sample rats should be sent in suitable boxes to the Local Government Board for examination. That notices setting out the best methods of destroying rats should be sent to householders. These are (a) Trapping by a professional ratcatcher, when the fleas infesting the rats can be destroyed at the same time by plunging the trap into a strong solution of soap and water, or disinfectant, (b) By making rat-pits, (c) By "Rattin" Virus, (d) By 162 chemical poisons, such as Barium Carbonate, Strychnia in the form of Battle's vermin-killer, Arsenic and Phosphor paste. That a register should be kept of rats destroyed, found sick and dead, with other particulars. That precautions should be taken in the handling of dead rats suspected to be affected by plague. That dead rats should be collected and cremated by the officials of the Public Health Department. That there should be increased vigilance in the removal of refuse for destruction from the neighbourhood of houses. That there should be more frequent scavenging, and attention given to the remedying of defective drains, so as to render as far as possible houses rat-proof. That food should be stored in a safe, and that the verminous condition of rooms should receive much more attention than is usually the case, for the destruction of bugs and fleas. Dr. Reece brought to my notice the necessity of early recognition of cases of Plague, and advised that a circular be sent to all medical practitioners in the borough asking them to co-operate in the movement, especially by prompt notification of suspicious cases. That the Officers of the Local government Board would be glad to assist when called upon. I have brought the matter to the notice of the inspectors and have circularised the wharfingers to provide me with information. The Food Inspector is making inquiries on the river bank, and the ward inspectors are visiting houses where rats are likely to be found. I am also directing that more verminous bedding should be disinfected, and I would advise that, where it is necessary to destroy bedding, beds of chaff should be given in exchange. This would be a comparatively inexpensive way of promoting cleanliness. I do not advise at present any increase in the staff. The following instructions have been given to the Sanitary Inspectors:— 153 (Dr. Brown of Bermondsey's Form). Directions to be followed in regard to Plague infected rats and to the destruction of rats generally in the district. 1.—Advice should be given as to the various ways of ridding premises of rats:— (a) The employment of a professional ratcatcher. (b) Trapping—Ratpits. (c) "Rattin" virus. (d) Chemical poisons, such as Barium Carbonate, Strychnia in the form of Battle's vermin killer, Asenic, Phosphor paste. 2. — Inquiries should be made throughout the borough, especially at the wharves and warehouses on the river bank, as to an unusual number of sick or dead rats on the premises. All persons to be asked to send information in connection therewith to the Medical Officer of Health. Mention at the same time should be made if any rat poison had been spread about. 3.—Dead or dying rats should not be handled with the naked hands. They should be taken up with a pair of tongs and plunged into a strong solution of soap and water, or into a solution of any of the well known disinfectants such as Izal, Cyllin, Jeyes'. Lysol, &c. The rats would, on information, be collected by the Public Health Department. 4.—All places where food is prepared should be kept scrupulously clean, and no unsound or refuse food should be kept for a longer period than is necessary at the wharves and warehouses. All destructible refuse in connection with houses should be burned, and not put into the dustbin. The Food Inspector to see that all condemned food is removed and destroyed without any delay. 5.—On information, the Public Health Department will collect all dead rats, either for examination or cremation. Boxes will be provided for rats about to be examined. 154 6. —An account of rats found dying, or dead, or destroyed in furnaces on premises, should be kept for the information of the Medical Officer of Health. 7.—All defective drains should be repaired, and all rat-runs traced to their source. 8.—Rats decomposed or destroyed by poison are not suitable for examination.

During 1911, 107 new names were added to the Register of Milksellers, and 79 names were removed during the same period. The total number of milksellers actually on the Register at the end of the year was 456. The sale of milk was discontinued at 16 premises, and the business of milkseller was newly started in 25 instances. 1,346 inspections of the various milkshops were made. The following nuisances were discovered, in respect to which 10 Intimation notices were served:— Dirty milkshops 7 cases Dirty milkstores 5 „ Paving defective 1 case Dirty utensils 3 cases Animals in milkshops 1 case Total 17 cases All the above nuisances were remedied.

COWSHEDS. There were again four notices of applications for the renewal of licences received in respect to Cowhouses in the borough. In reporting to the Public Health Committee upon the condition of the cowhouses, I stated that they were at the time of my inspection found to be in a good structural and cleanly condition, with the exception of the cowhouse at 21, Globe Street, the room of which used for the storing of milk was badly ventilated and should have the skylight made to partly open, and the cowhouse at 10 and 11, Sturge Street, which was structurally defective in regard to the roof and gutters, the stall partitions and mangers. This cowhouse I also found to be very dark. I advised that a representation should be made to the London County Council in respect to the conditions complained of in these two cowhouses. On the 18th October this Council resolved that no objection should be offered to the renewal of the licences in respect to the four cowhouses, subject, however, in the case of 21, Globe Street, and 10 and 12, Sturge Street, to representations being made to the London County Council regarding their condition. The Public Health Officials of the London County Council, however, decided to oppose the renewal of the licence in respect to 10 and 11, Sturge Street, and the licence in respect to those premises was in consequence refused. 182 The following is a list of the Licensed Cowkeepers in the Borough Situation of Premises. Name of Occupier. 8, Alvey Street Thomas Birkbeck 21, Globe Street Herbert Jones 5, Holland Street Julia Ann Cooksby The several cowsheds were inspected periodically, the inspectors making a total of 47 visits.
