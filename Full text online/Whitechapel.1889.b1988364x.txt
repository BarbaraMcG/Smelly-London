' Officers of the Whitechapel District Board of Works, No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E., February 27th, 1890. Gentlemen, Previously to inviting your attention to the various matters which are contained in the Report for the year 1889, which I have the honor to submit for your perusal, I propose to quote as usual some items which I have culled from the Report for the year 1888, issued from the Office of the Registrar-General. Such information may be interesting to any member who desires to supplement certain particulars which were included in my Report for that year. REGISTRATION LONDON. Area. The Area of Registration London is 77,410 acres, or 121 square miles, including 2718 acres of tidal water. The length of streets and roads is more than 1600 miles. Elevation. The population of London resides at a mean elevation of 39 feet above Trinity high water mark. Houses. At the Census in 1881 there were within this area 486,056 inhabited houses, containing an average of 7.9 persons to a house. Density (1888). 142 persons to a hectare; 57.3 persons to an acre; 36,700 to a square mile. No account is here taken of tidal water. Annual Rate of Increase of Population per cent. 1861-71 1.50 1871-81 1.61 1888. Population (estimated to the middle of the year) Males 2,017, 169 Females 2,265, 752 Persons 4, 282, 921 Marriages 34,617 Annual Rate of persons married per 1000 of the population 16.1 Births Male 66,629 Females 64,451 Persons 131,080 Annual Rate of Births per 1000 of the population 30.7 a2 4 Deaths Males 40,337 Females 38,511 Persons 78,848 Annual Rate of Mortality per 1000 Males 20.1 Females 17.1 Persons 18.5 Excess of Registered Births over Deaths 52,232 Estimated increase of Population 68,273 The year 1888, as has been the case for several immediately previous years, was a year of remarkably low rates. The Marriages registered in London were in the proportion of 16.1 persons married to 1000 of the population. This is the lowest marriage rate as yet recorded. The Births registered in London were in the proportion of 30.7 per 1000 inhabitants. This rate is the lowest since 1841, when it was 30.4 The Deaths registered in the year corresponded to an annual rate of 18.5 per 1000, which is far the lowest rate as yet recorded in London. I have again to notice the remarkable accuracy shown by the statistical department at Somerset House, in the statement of births and deaths for the Whitechapel District. The former are within 1, and the latter within 16 of being correct. Probably the slight error has arisen from lack of accurate knowledge of our boundaries. There is no correct map of the Whitechapel District now in our possession, so to meet this want to a certain extent, I have prefaced the Appendix of the present Report by a detailed list of the Streets, &c., within your jurisdiction, arranged so that any house may be known readily, either to be or not to be, withir that area. Deaths belonging to the several Sanitary Areas of Registration London, registered in the 52 weeks of 1888. Sanitary Areas. Deaths. Deaths under 1 year of age to 1000 Births registered. Registration London 77,686 146 Shoreditch 2,719 156 Bethnal Green 2,958 156 St. George-in-the-East 1,283 195 Stepney 1,465 191 Mile End Old Town 2,100 136 Poplar 3,326 138 Whitechapel 1,558 155 REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1889. UPON the principle hitherto adopted, and previously explained, I have calculated the population of the Whitechapel District to be 75,057. In 1881, the Census declared the District to contain 71,368 persons, distributed amongst the five Registration Sub-DistriCts in the following manner:— Registration Sub-District. Census year 1881. Estimated for the year 1889. Spitalfields 22,585 22,714 Mile End New Town 15,1473 22,487 Whitechapel Church 17,490 17,715 Goodman's Fields 9,713 6,430 Aldgate 6,102 5.711 Thus work out the figures. Whether each Sub-District has apportioned to it an approximately correct population, must be determined by the result of the next Census, but I believe that the total estimate may be considered to be fairly accurate. The method which is generally made use of to estimate a population in the middle of a given year, becomes valueless for that purpose when applied to the Whitechapel District, because during the intercensal period 1871-1881, the population decreased to the extent of more than 5000 persons, and I am of opinion that during the intercensal period 1881-1891, it will be found that probably an increase to an equal degree will have taken place. The total births which were registered in the Whitechapel District during the 52 weeks of the year 1889, were 2633. Corrected for the non-resident births which took place in the Whitechapel Union Infirmary, the number is 2627, or an increase of 20 as compared with the previous year. The total deaths which were registered during the year, amounted to 2155. Detailed particulars respecting these births and deaths are arranged in Tables A and B* of the Appendix. Correction requires to be made for the residents of other Districts, whose deaths were registered in the Whitechapel District, as well * Page 26. 6 as for those who died in public Institutions and elsewhere, outside the District, although they were strictly belonging to our population. In the former class there were 749, and in the latter, which includes the extra Metropolitan Asylums, 127 persons: vide Appendix, Tables C and D.* Thus the corrected District Mortality for the year was 1533. It may interest the curious in such matters, to learn that 37.5 per cent. of the total District deaths were registered in public Institutions; and 8.3 per cent. took place in public Institutions not within the District. The deaths corresponded to an annual death-rate of 20.4 per 1000. 1 have subjoined for a series of years the death-rate in the Whitechapel District:— Year. Death Rate per 1000. 1866 (Cholera epidemic.) 38.7 1871 27.7 1881 26.6 1883 24.1 1884 22.6 1885 22.2 1886 22.5 1887 21.8 1888 21.1 1889 20.4 To emphasise the lesson which is here taught. the eminent sanitarian, Sir Edwin Chadwick, has published some statements concerning the Whitechapel District. His Tables apply to the years 1838-40, and they exhibit a sad story of the ravages caused by Typhus and other forms of Fever, &c. Sir Edwin has preserved some reports which show that efforts were subsequently made by a voluntary Committee to amend the ill-condition which was known to exist in some parts of the District, and which at that time was thought to be productive of disease. In 1849, an Association was formed for the purpose of "promoting habits tending to the cleanliness, health and comfort, of the industrious classes in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel." Of this Association, the Rev. W. W. Champneys was President, and amongst the Committee occur the names of Messrs. Fillingham, French, Hawkins, Powell, Straw, &c. It was at once acknowledged * Page 26. 7 that the general mal-condition of the tenements and yards, conduced to the high death-rate, and as the conclusions arrived at by the Committee, sometimes even at the present time apply to certain places and persons in London, I am tempted to reproduce them for perusal: "The principal causes, tending to deteriorate "the health and well-being of the industrious classes, which have "been presented to the notice of your Committee, are as follows:— "1. Insufficient supply of water. "2. The existence of nuisances in and around the dwellings "caused by— "(a) The want of drainage. "(b) The defective state of the pavement. "(c) The neglect of the Scavengers and Dustmen. "3. The dilapidated condition of many of the houses in the "poorer districts. "4. The overcrowded state of the tenements, more especially "the low lodging-houses. "5. The want of light and ventilation. "6. The filthy habits of the people." Most of these causes now no longer exist, and to the resulting improvement must be credited the diminished death-rate to which I have directed attention. Much mors can be done, nay, much more must be done, before sanitarians with their present knowledge, can truly assert that all the aid has been given to those dwellers in tenements, which they have a right to expect. To improved sanitation, as well as to the increased efforts of the people themselves, we must turn for further improvement. The natural increase of births over deaths for the year 1889, is 1094. During the last six years, the natural increase has been respectively as follows:—In 1889, 1094; in 1888, 1033; in 1887, 970; in 1886, 901; in 1885, 945; in 1884, 905. Percentage of Deaths for each Age, period during 1889:— 25.0 % of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 16.6 ,, ,, ,, between the ages of 1 and 5. 4.5 ,, ,, ,, ,, 5 and 20. 13.3 ,, „ „ „ 20 and 40. 20.3 ,, ,, ,, ,, 40 and 60. 17.0 ,, ,, ,, ,, Go and 80. 3.0 ,, ,, ,, over the age of 80. 8 Here the improvement to which I diredled your attention last year continues to be maintained, and it is interesting to note that those persons who lived to the age of 80 and upwards numbered 47, and consisted of 16 Males and 31 Females. Of these, 3 were nonogenarians, and in the Spitalfields SubDistrict, a female resident died at the age of 100 years. These aged persons were registered as having resided in the following Sub-Districts:— In the Spitalfields Sub-District 10 „ Mile End New Town Sub-District 2 „ Whitechapel District 6 ,, Goodman's Fields „ 5 „ Aldgate „ 4 ,, Whitechapel Union Infirmary 20 Analysis of the Cause of Death of the 1533 Residents who Died during the Year 1889. It is necessary to explain that although certain modifications in nomenclature have been suggested, I have preferred to follow the plan by which the Registrar-General classifies the causes of death for the Metropolis, as well as for England and Wales. I do so, because it affords some indication of our position, enabling us to compare the deaths amongst 75,000 persons, with those which have occurred in the 4 millions comprising the Metropolitan population. Also by continuing during a series of years a uniform system, we are enabled to study our returns by the light of information derived from previous records. Tables M and N,* as also the summary in Table I, † will exemplify the uses to which comparative figures may be applied. Although, generally there is correspondence as regards many of the particulars herein set out, I have again to invite your attention to the fact, that the percentage of Metropolitan deaths from zymotic diseases to total deaths, is greater than that for Whitechapel from the same class of diseases. For the Metropolis, including Whitechapel, it is equal to 14.46 per cent., and for Whitechapel, it equals only 12.98 per cent. A detailed examination of the specific deaths from zymotic diseases shows, that no deaths were registered in the District during the year from Small-pox, and also that exactly the same number of deaths took place from Measles, as from Diarrhoea and * Pages 30 and 31. + Page 29. 9 Dysentery. In the notification of Infectious Diseases' Act, which became Law in the autumn, Measles has not been included in the list of diseases required to be notified. It is of course competent for a District to add any disease to those enumerated, but it seems preferable that uniformity should be adopted throughout the Metropolitan area, rather than that our District should differ from its neighbours in such details. Scarlet-Fever proved fatal in only two instances, in one of which the death took place in an Asylums' Board Hospital. Whooping Cough was the registered cause of death in 12 cases, and Diphtheria was responsible for 33 deaths, about half taking place in various hospitals. 9 persons died from Enteric Fever, and a similar number from other zymotic diseases not here particularised. Typhus Fever is again absent as a cause of death. Whilst discussing the deaths which have taken place from this preventible class of diseases, it is of importance to inquire, so far as we are able, into the number of cases of such diseases which occur in the District, with a view to learn something, not only of the quantity, but also of the quality of the morbid products which are at work in our midst. I can only give details concerning those cases which were admitted into Metropolitan Asylums' Board Hospitals during 10 months of the year, because so soon as the notification of Infectious Diseases' Act came into operation, the Managers ceased to furnish the weekly record which we thought very serviceable. The following Table has been prepared iron lose returns during the period mentioned:— Disease. Whence Admitted. First Quarter. Second Quarter. Third Quarter. Up to end of October Total. Small Pox All London 3 0 0 0 3 Whitechapel. 2 0 o o 2 Scarlet Fever All London 609 632 1394 662 3297 Whitechapel 0 4 9 0 13 Enteric Fever All London 47 30 110 48 235 Whitechapel 0 0 1 1 2 Typhus Fever All London 3 0 3 0 6 Whitechapel. 0 0 0 0 0 Diphtheria All London 86 114 260 90 550 Whitechapel 4 5 8 9 26 Doubtful All London 2 3 1 0 6 Whitechapel. 0 0 0 0 0 OtherDiseases All London 0 0 1 0 1 Whitechapel. 0 0 0 0 0 B 10 The inclusion of Diphtheria in the diseases admitted into the Asylums' Hospitals, has been a most useful concession, and one which has proved helpful to the District. In my last Report, I gave details of an instructive case of Small-pox which was received into a two-roomed house in Dock Street from Lisbon. The patient was quickly transferred to the hospital ship; disinfection was thoroughly performed, and I re-vaccinated all those who were stated to be resident in the cottage. The climax of this case arrived, when, after the usual period of incubation for Small-pox had passed, I was requested to see a man who was a lodger in the house, but whose existence had not been declared, and who consequently had escaped re-vaccination. This proved to be a case of Small-pox. It was treated in the same way by removal, and subsequent disinfection of the place was again carried out. No further extension of the disease occurred. I recite this episode, because I believe that a few such well marked cases must convince anyone who is open to conviction, to the advantages of vaccination and re-vaccination, and the danger which may result from their avoidance. In a cleverly written article by Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, occurs, perhaps the most remarkable testimony to the protective power of vaccination from Small-pox. "During the epidemic in Sheffield, there were 830 "soldiers in barracks, all of whom had, in accordance with army "regulations, been re-vaccinated. These men were allowed to "visit their friends without restriction, and the barracks were in "the part of Sheffield just affected by the disease. Of the 830 "twelve only contracted small-pox, or 1-4 per cent. Of these one "died. Enquiry elicited the remarkable fact that in all the twelve "cases the re-vaccination had been unsuccessful. No single "soldier who had been successfully re-vaccinated contracted small"pox. There were 372 policemen in Sheffield during the epidemic. "All had been vaccinated in infancy. Ten of these contracted the "disease prior to February 1888, when all were re-vaccinated. " After the re-vaccination none were attacked. "Of 290 men and boys employed in the Post Office, all of whom, "in accordance with regulations, had been re-vaccinated, not a "single one contracted small-pox in any form. It is obvious that "they would run special risks as regards exposure." 11 Table L* may be referred to for these details. Some increased interest towards the general subject of vaccination is attracted by the labours of the Royal Commission at present sitting to take evidence pro and con. The members of the Commission whilst selected for their ability hold divers views—and therefore the outcome of their deliberation must prove to be very valuable. In the meantime it is important to notice the continued good and efficient work performed in the District, as evinced by the statement which I copy from Mr. Sherman's report. Vaccination Statistics. To enable a correct statement to appear for these habitations, I have had a census prepared. It is found that the death-rate for the persons who occupy the class of dwellings under consideration is 19.7 per 1000. Although this is a satisfactory record, it would be much more so, were all the buildings equally well-constructed to fulfil sanitary requirements. Thus, the death-rate for the model dwellings, excluding Katherine, Lolesworth and Plough Street Buildings is less than 17 per 1000. Contrast this result with another calculation which includes only Albert, Alfred, Royal Mint Street and College buildings and the death-rate sinks to 15.8 per 1000. If this proves anything at all, it is clear that more attention should be given towards legislating in such a way, that excepting under direct sanitary control, no buildings should be erected which do not comply with every provision which science demands at the present time.

Table F* in the Appendix may be consulted for the age distribution of those residents who died during the year. From this Table I have deduced the usual information concerning the deaths of infants and children under the age of five years. Such figures are contrasted with the Metropolitan statistics which apply to similar ages. The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London, equalled 24.6 per cent. of the total deaths, and 14.2 of the registered births; whilst, in the Whitechapel District, those intants who died under the age of one year, equalled 25.0 per cent., of the total deaths, against 25.2 per cent. last year; and 14.6 per cent. of the registered births, against 15.2 per cent, which was the record for the preceding year. Infant Mortality. * Page 27. 13 The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were for London equal to 40.2 per cent. of the total deaths, and 23.1 per cent. of the registered births; and, for the Whitechapel District, they were equal to 41.6 per cent. of the total deaths, and 24.3 per cent. of the registered births. These were nearly allied to last year's record. These deaths during the year numbered 30. They were registered in the following Asylums as under:— In the Banstead Asylum 8 Colney Hatch ,, 14 Leavesden ,, 8 Seven died between the ages of 60 and 80; 8 between 40 and 60; and 15 between 20 and 40. Brain disease proved fatal in 17 instances; in 6, Phthisis was the registered cause of death; Heart disease and Chest complications were responsible for 6 deaths; whilst 1 death was attributed to Cancer.

Half of these were non-residents, and the inquests on them were mostly held in the London Hospital. In apportioning to each Coroner a District, it was unfortunate that to one officer was assigned a part of the Whieechapel District, while his colleague has jurisdiction over the remainder. This is inconvenient, and if no other way can be devised to overcome the difficulty, I shall submit a proposition for your consideration when your Mortuary has become ready for occupation. And here I would gratefully allude to the labours of your Mortuary Committee. By the courtesy of certain authorities concerned, various Metropolitan Mortuaries have been inspected; and thus the Committee are enabled to recommend for your consideration such structural plans for a Mortuary which will prove a great boon to the District. The arguments in favour of a well arranged Mortuary being in every District are so well known, and moreover, have been so frequently discussed by your Board, that I will pass on from this subject with the hope that my next Report will contain a description of the new buildings, and some of the benefits which have already resulted from their possession. Inquests. Those cases where death occurred without medical attendance, and where no inquest was thought by the Coroners to be necessary, amounted to 6. One man, aged 49 years, was a resident of the Sailors' Home; 4 were infants, whose deaths were certified by midwives to be due to "premature birth," and who were aged only a few hours; whilst the remainining death was due to Bronchitis, and was that of a child aged 2½ years. Three were males, and 3 were females. Three were registered in the Spitalfields Sub-District, and 1 each was registered in the Uncertified Deaths. 15 Mile End New Town, Goodman's Fields, and Aldgate Sub- Districts respectively. In the London Hospital there died during the year 874 persons, of whom only 136 had resided in the District previously to their admission. There were 316 deaths registered in the White- chapel Union Infirmary. Of these persons, all but four had been resident in the District before admission. Public Institutions within the District.

Pauper Statistics. The Water supplied by the New River and the East London Water Companies during the year has not differed appreciably, either in quantity or quality, from that sent out during recent years. The usual monthly statements which are published by the Government Water Examiner; and also the Analytical and Biological Returns which Messrs. Tidy and Oddling furnish, afford satisfactory evidence that care is taken to supply good water in sufficient quantity. Water Supply to the District. Tables Q and R† are included in the Appendix. They set out in the usual manner certain particulars which, properly used are of service to Sanitarians. The slaughter-houses have become reduced in number since I last reported.

Three years having now elapsed since the Destructor Works were opened in Wentworth Street—it seems fitting that some observations should appear respecting the working of this most important addition to the Sanitary machinery of the Whitechapel District. Circumstances had rendered it necessary that some other means of dealing with the refuse of dust-bins should be exchanged for that hitherto in use, which consisted in paying heavily for the privilege of removing the nuisance from one District into another. As the result of your deliberations the works were constructed, a description of which transcribed from your Surveyor's Report, appeared in my Annual Statement, soon after the Destructor was in active operation. It was anticipated that some opposition would be advanced to a method which was novel so far as concerned the Metropolis. It is due to the careful management of the furnaces, combined with certain modifications as regards details, as well as to the completeness of the original structure, that the present arrangements 18 have commanded the commendations of all the authorities who have inspected the works. So far as the existing resources of the Destrucftor cells are concerned, it is satisfactory to learn that they consume almost all the house refuse which is collected within the District, and an increased cell capacity will probably result in adding value to the clinker. It is a very important statement to make, that at the present time all house refuse and garbage of every description is rendered absolutely inert by its passage through the fires. It promises well for the not distant future, that already a considerable number of houses are supplied with pails wherein to store refuse, and these receptacles are emptied daily, and their contents conveyed to the Destructor. As provision can be made, block after block of houses will be included in this arrangement, until the whole house refuse of the District will be collected and destroyed daily. Then dust-bins will exist only in the memories of those who have often deplored their presence in close proximity to rooms, the air of which they frequently tainted. I may be permitted to add that already the present cost of dealing with the refuse does not much exceed the cost formerly incurred, whilst a large increase has been noted in the number of loads which have been collected and destroyed. Certain Acts of Parliament have been added to the Statute-book. The Notification of Infectious Diseases Act, which came into operation in October, has already been found useful. I need not point out how necessary it becomes for Sanitary Authorities to be made early acquainted with the first cases of infectious diseases. The advantage to the public of such an Act is great, although its working adds considerably to the labours of your staff. The diseases which the Act specifies as requiring to be notified, are: "Small-pox, Cholera, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Erysipelas, Scarlet Fever, Typhus Fever, Typhoid Fever, Relapsing, Continued, and Puerperal Fevers." Also any other diseases which, after due notice has been given to the ratepayers, and the sanction of the Local Government Board has been obtained, the Local Authority deems it necessary to add. A horse-flesh Act has been passed. This Act compels the vendors of horse-flesh to legibly label the meat, and it also gives power to the Sanitary Officers to "inspect, examine, and seize horseflesh illegally exposed for sale." 19 The Poor Law Amendment Act, 1889, enables the Asylums' Board Managers to admit any person, who is not a pauper, who is reasonably believed to be suffering from Fever, Small-pox, or Diphtheria into one of their hospitals. Certain clauses provide for the re-imbursement to the Guardians of sums which they have paid for cases. In pursuance of the provisions in this Act, the managers have issued a Report to give effect to the following recommendations of their Ambulance Committee:— (a) That the managers do allow their carriages to be made use of for the conveyance of persons suffering from "dangerous infectious disorders" to places other than the Board's Hospitals, pursuant to the power enforced upon them by Section 6 of the Poor Law Act, 1889. (b) That the charge to be made for each conveyance be, for the present, five shillings. (c) That discretionary power be conferred upon the Ambulance Committee to remit the charge for such conveyance when they deem it is expedient in the interest of the public health. (d) That the Ambulance Committee be authorised to convey persons, under exceptional circumstances, to or from places outside the Metropolitan area, and to make an extra charge for the same. (e) That it be referred to the Ambulance Committee to frame such regulations as may be necessary to give effect to the several decisions arrived at by the Managers. A Public Health Act, which contains provisions to prevent the spread of Cholera, became law in 1889. This Act is concerned chiefly in enlarging the action and power of the Local Government Board. Finally, there was passed an Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to, and for the Protection of, Children. It is a matter of general observation, that the Metropolis is worse off as regards Sanitary Laws than all other Districts where the Public Health Act, 1875, applies. It becomes necessary sometimes to cast about before we can fish out from amongst the many existing Sanitary Acts, some section which will enable some particular matter to be dealt with. It will, therefore, be a boon to have comprised within one Act of Parliament, that which now 20 runs through very many. This Consolidation Bill is in draft—and it also contains a Clause giving to a Magistrate power to inflict a fine, not exceeding five pounds, where neglect to remedy a nuisance has been proved. It has become an annual custom to refer to the well-known Bell Lane and Great Pearl Street schemes, both of which were inherited by the London County Council from the Metropolitan Board of Works. It has been my privilege to be associated with Mr. Shirley Murphy in an inspection of these areas. A Committee of the Council has also visited them. No report has reached me concerning the Bell Lane area, but you are aware that a communication has emanated from the Council to your Board, stating that in the opinion of the Council, Cross's Acts of Parliament do not seem applicable to the houses which make up the Great Pearl Street area. It remains, therefore, for your Officers to deal as best they can with this property. I have already seen the owners and agents who are concerned, with a view to obtain some uniform and combined improvement. I am waiting for some specifications to be submitted which shall effect this object. One month was suggested and agreed to as a fair time during which no action should be taken. I cannot, however, avoid stating that I am disappointed with the present arrangement, because I think some provision should be made for the better accommodation and supervision of the class of persons who now inhabit those wretched rooms, called "Furnished rooms;'' and it seems to me that no better site could have been selected for experiment than the Great Pearl Street area. It is not possible to consider this subject seriously, without having to confess that we are here face to face with, perhaps, the most difficult social problem of the present day. Philanthropists are often devoted individually to schemes for "improving the welfare of the poor," and each person has some pet scheme to suit some particular class. I think some combination of such suggestions might lead to better results, than can take by allowing the present somewhat patchy way of working to continue. The question often arises: Have the very poor been treated fairly in this great matter of house accommodation? Let me state the case. A large area is cleared of wretched hovels to make way for large piles of cleanlylooking buildings. What has become of the people who were dislodged? Are they re-housed in the new Model Dwellings? Certainly not. In the first place the rents demanded are above 21 their means, and in the second place, the caretakers overlook them •in their careful plan of selection. It follows that they must drift into other rooms in houses, perhaps, already sufficiently occupied. It is thus clear that the very class of persons requiring most urgently some better accommodation is the class for which the large building Trusts have not provided. Could not the Guinness Trustees do something towards compensating the very poor for the lack of consideration which has been awarded them? It is useless to expect that the rents which this class could afford would pay for land and buildings, and then enable a four per cent. dividend to be declared—but given the rooms in the first instance from some benevolent source, they would then be self-supporting. A better hygienic condition would reduce the sickness and death-rates, and the lessened risk to the general public would amply compensate for the outlay, and for the necessary supervision. Apart from the many improvements which have been effected amongst individual houses during the year, some very important works have been carried out at the instigation of your Sanitary staff. I may mention two, where considerable structural alterations are now going on. In one case the builder's contract is £444 for eight houses; and in another the lowest tender amounted to £378 for a block of about a dozen houses. To those who are of opinion that the perfection of health results from the possession of "a sound mind in a sound body," it must be a source of gratification that through the efforts of your Board, the Public Libraries' Act has been adopted for the Whitechapel District To provide a cheerful room with well-selected literature, where the occupants of tenements may be educationally entertained, is a distinct move in the right direction. I must not conclude without an allusion to the addition in our Sanitary staff. I feel confident that the work of Mr. Sleath will assist very much the work of Sanitary reform which is in progress. In inviting your attention to the results of the Inspectors' labours which they have tabulated for your perusal, it becomes my pleasing duty to chronicle the efforts which the Messrs. Wrack always make to carry out my wishes for the welfare of the District. Their genial manner facilitates business, and it becomes less seldom necessary to have recourse to magisterial aid to obtain the 22 tion of those Orders which from time to time your Board is called upon to sanction. The present arrangements, whilst affording more time to the general supervision of the District, allows progress to be made in the systematic house to house visitation, which I believe to be of great importance amongst a community of so cosmopolitan a character as that which now constitutes the Whitechapel District. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH LOANE. 23 APPENDIX. Abel's buildings, W.C. Adelaide place, C.C. Albert street, M.E.N.T. Albert place, M.E.N.T.
