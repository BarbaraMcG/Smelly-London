It contains the usual statistical information about the work of the Department, and in this introduction I refer to one or two matters of special interest. The population of the Borough has been gradually diminishing and in 1959 the decline continued from 110,400 to 108,500, that is, a decrease of 1,900. The total number of live and still births was 2,066, while the live birth rate based on the number of live births (2,030) was 17.96, compared with 16.16 in the previous year. There were 1,328 deaths amongs Battersea residents, which gave a death rate of 11.63 per thousand the population, compared with 11.07 the previous year. Forty-four infants under the age of one year died, compared with 45 in 1958, and this figure gives an infant mortality rate for all infants of 21.67, compared with 23.96 in the previous year. This rate is the lowest since 1954, when a rate of 18.99 was recorded. The rate does not after greatly from year to year. It will be remembered that I dealt with this question of infant mortality at some length in my annual report for 1954 There were two deaths from causes associated with childbirth compared with one for 1958, giving a maternal mortality rate of 0.97. The figures for the infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate in the administrative County of London are 22.3 and 0.60. 1959 was regarded as a "Measles Year" although in fact number of cases of measles notified, namely 702, was not greatly excess of the number for 1958 (614), an increase of 88. This increase however, explains the over-all increase in the number of notification received—1,187 compared with 1,152, modified by the decrease in the number of notifications of dysentery and whooping cough. There were 71 cases of scarlet fever notified, and 13 cases of poliomyelitis, of which 11 had some form of residual paralysis. Immunisation against poliomyelitis continued, under the arrangements made by the London Country Council local health division, and during the year approximately 14,600 persons received prophylactic injections. The number of cases of tuberculosis which were notified during the year was 75, the same as the previous year, but 25 fewer than 1957 and 65 fewer than in 1954. In addition, we became aware of 63 other cases. in the main transfers into Battersea from other areas. During the year there were eight deaths from tuberculosis, compared with 20 in 1958 Of the eight deaths in the current year, 7 were due to pulmonary tuberculosis, whilst in 1958, 17 were due to this cause. This is a substantial reduction and even if it were not to be repeated next year, it is still a remarkably low number of deaths in an area of this size. I referred in my report last year to the diminishing problem that tuberculosis is presenting, and clearly this trend continues. Of the other deaths from diseases of the chest, in 1959 there were 55 (in 1958—69) from cancer of the lung, and from bronchitis, 118 (in 1958—87). It is obvious that as judged by the number of deaths, lung cancer and bronchitis are now 5 a much more serious problem than is tuberculosis. It is not necessary to cheat what I said in last year's report on this subject, but the changing emphasis in problems relating to chest disease is once again evident from the figures. Last year for the first time I introduced a small section of the report devoted to accidents in the home. I continued this in the current year, and include figures for 1959, calculated as described in last year's report. According to these figures, there was an over-all reduction in the number of home accidents from 262 to 240, reducing the rate per ten thousand of the population from 23.7 to 22.1. The proportion of the various types of accidents did not, however, appear to have altered very much. The figures given are not absolutely accurate, although it is thought that they do not vary very much. Probably not too much notice should be taken this reduction, but at least it is satisfying to note that there was no clear increase in the number of home accidents in Battersea. included in the body of the report is some information about progress under the Clean Air Act, 1956. I am glad to be able to say that considerable progress has been made, and that during the year the Council's first smo smoke control area came into operation and that has been now been virtually completed in that area. The second area has been submitted to the Minister and preliminary approval for the making of an Order has been received. It is hoped that the formal order will be made and confirmed in the autumn of 1960. Meanwhile, work is Proceeding on the preliminary survey of the next area, and I south of the able to report next year that a considerable area in the South of the Borough is a smoke control area. During the year, an opportunity presented itself for an interesting and valuable survey of the housing conditions in the Winstanley Road Area. This area has long been a special problem from the housing and public health points of view. In previous years, parts of the area had been represented for slum clearance, and progress had been made in developing the area. There are, however many advantages in dealing with the area as a whole rather than piecemeal and accordingly arrangements were made by the temporary re-deployment of the Public Health Inspectors, entailing some work out of office hours, to obtain a Comprehensive survey of the whole of the area. Some 900 properties were involved and each was meticulously inspected under the Housing Act. The task took approximately four months, and it took rather less than another two months for the Department to catch up with some of the less urgent and more routine work which had been allowed to fall behind The result was that we were able to represent to the Housing committee a substantial part of this area under the Slum Clearance Section of the Housing Act. What, however, was probably of equal importance of the information obtained about social and public health conditions in the area. Of the nearly 900 houses inspected, rather more than one-fifth were found to be unfit for human habitation, within the meaning of the Housing Act. It had been expected that a considerable amount of overcrowding would be found. On the contrary, there were in fact only 16 cases of statutory overcrowding, although, of course, the existing overcrowding standards under the Housing Act, being some 25years old are not much in accordance with modern ideas. On the other hand the degree of under-occupation was surprisingly large, that 6 is to say, quite a high proportion of the properties were occupied by single people or by couples. This survey was a very worthwhile piece of work, for it provided not only up-to-date information which enabled us to represent a large part of the area to the Housing Committee, but it also gave us some interesting information about the social and public health aspects of a substantial part of the Borough which had long provided us with many problems. It is once again a pleasure to record the help I and the Department have received during the year. I would like particularly to thank Councillor Miss E. A. Coles, Chairman of the Health Committee, for her support throughout the year; members of the staff of other departments for their co-operation, and of course all my colleagues in the Health Department for the good work carried out in 1959. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. TUDOR LEWIS, Medical Officer of Health. 7 Public Health in Retrospect 1859-1959 In previous Annual Reports I have referred to reports made by my prodecessors one hundred years ago, and the following information has been extracted from a Report by Dr. Connor, Medical Officer of Health for the Battersea Parish in 1859. The Population of Battersea in 1859 was probably about 18,500 Persons as at the census in 1851, the figure was 10,560, whilst the census of 1861 showed it to have risen to 19,852 (Population 1959— 108,500). Deaths registered in Battersea in 1859 numbered 394 (194 males, 200 females) 14 in excess of 1858, and 35 more than the corrected average of the three preceding years. (Deaths 1959—1,328 (657 males, 671 females with a rate of 11.63 per 1,000 population. The comparable rate for 1858 would have been 21.3). Dr. Connor states— "This excess is, I apprehend, in a great measure due to three causes—the continuance of the epidemic Scarlet Fever that occurred in November, 1858, the increased prevalence of Hooping-cough and Diarrhoea, and the unusual coldness of portions of the past year, which is attested by an increased mortality resulting from diseases of the respiratory organs ". "The mortality amongst children between birth and 10 years of age has, I am pleased to state, rather diminished during the past year, 166 being the number registered against 174 in 1858; still, however, the number in 1859 is very large, and indicates the persistent operation of the much to be deplored cause alluded to in my last Annual Report." (This reference in the 1858 Annual Report was to "a crowded industrial population, engaged principally in factory and field labour, and the employment of women in these occupations, the majority of whom are mothers.") During 1859, 97 infants under one year of age died, and, with the number of births being 685, this gave an infant mortality rate of 141.61 per 1000 live births, compared with 44 infant deaths in 1959 and a rate of 21.67. It is interesting to note that Dr. Connor recorded the "Social position" of the persons dying during the year as follows : — Nobility and Gentry 1 professional Class, Merchants, Bankers, etc 6 Middle and Trading Class, Shopmen, Clerks, etc. 69 Industrial and Labouring Classes 318 Dr. Connor concludes his Report—"every means are being employed, not only to rid the sub-district of all nuisances known or suspected of engendering or aggravating disease, but to gradually introduce such sanitary reforms as cannot fail to greatly benefit the parish, if not to place it ultimately (abounding, though it does, in manufactories of every kind) amongst the healthiest of the metropolitan suburbs similarly circumstanced." 8 Principal Figures for 1959.

For the purpose of standardisation, the Registrar-General's area comparebility factors which make allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, have been applied to the rates for births and deaths. The factor for births is 0.96, and for deaths 0.95. POPULATION. The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year home population of Battersea was 108,500 as compared with 110,400 in 1958, a decrease of 1,900. The estimated population at the Census taken in April, 1951, was 117,140; the 1959 figure of 108,500, when compared with this, shows a decrease of 8,640 (or 7.4 per cent.). The estimated mid-year home population figure of 108,500 has been adopted for the purpose of the statistics contained in this Report. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered in the Borough during 1959 was 538 (284 males, 254 females). Of this number 6 were transferred out, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough, and 1,498 registered outside the Borough were transferred in, giving on balance a total of 2,030 births (1,056 males, 974 females, an excess of 82 males) relating to Battersea residents, and a live birth rate of 17.96 Per 1,000 population. Of the Battersea births (532 live and 4 still) which occurred within the Borough, 535 were " domiciliary births." Illegitimate live births numbered 182 or 8.9 per cent, of the live births The live birth rate for England and Wales was 16.5. Still-Births. The Registration of still-births is made compulsory by the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1926. During 1959 there were 6 still-births registered in Battersea, of which 4 were of Battersea parents. Thirty-two still-births occurring outside the Borough were registered as belonging to Battersea, making 36 in all, representing a still-birth rate of 17.42 per 1,000 births (five and still) registered. Of the 36 still-births 8 (22.22 per cent.) were registered as illegitimate. The number of Battersea still-births registered and the still-birth rates from 1950 to 1959 were as under:— No. Rate No. Rate 1950 53 27.2 1955 32 18.1 1951 37 19.2 1956 48 26.42 1952 42 23.2 1957 51 27.01 1953 38 20.9 1958 39 20.34 1954 50 28.0 1959 36 17.42 The still-birth rate in 1959 for England and Wales was 20.7. 10 MARRIAGES. The marriages registered in Battersea during 1959 numbered 876. The marriage rate (i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 of the population) was 16.2. Year Marriages Marriage Rate 1954 912 16.0 1955 971 17.1 1956 896 15.9 1957 966 17.3 1958 876 15.7 Mean 1954/58 924 16.4 1959 876 16.2 The marriage rate for England Wales was 15.0. DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in the Borough during 1959 2,194. Of these, 1,243 were deaths of non-residents and were transferred to the districts in which the persons ordinarily resided. .There were, on the other hand, 377 deaths of Battersea residents registered outside the Borough. The total (corrected) number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 1,328 (657 males and 671 females). This gives a recorded death rate of 11.63 compared with 11.6 for England and Wales. The following table shows the age and sex distribution of the total deaths (corrected) in Battersea during 1959: — Under 1 year 1— 5— 15— 25— 45— 65— 75+ Total M. 21 4 1 14 20 201 182 214 657 F. 23 4 — 4 27 107 155 351 671 Totals 44 8 1 18 47 308 337 565 1,328 % of total 3.3 0.6 0.1 1.4 3.5 23.2 25.4 42.5 100.0 Of the 1,328 Battersea deaths 840 (or 63.3 per cent.) occurred in hospitals, etc. The average age at death is shown in the following table : — Average Age at Death. 1945 62.4 1950 65.5 1946 61.4 1951 66.7 1947 62.6 1952 67.7 1948 63.3 1953 68.9 1949 65.3 1954 67.2 Mean, 1945/1949 63.0 Mean, 1950/1954 67.4 1955 67.7 1956 66.9 1957 67.2 1958 68.3 1959 67.7 Mean, 1955 / 59 67.6 11 The deaths of 902 residents of Battersea aged 65 years and Upwards were registered during 1959. These 902 deaths constituted 67.9 per cent of the total deaths at all ages. The natural increase of population (that is, excess of births over deaths) was 702 in 1959 as compared with 631 in 1958. The causes of the 1,328 deaths in 1959, classified in various age groups, are shown in the following table. Causes of Death at Different Periods of Life during 1959.

During 1959 the number of deaths of Battersea residents from cancer was 246 (139 males, 107 females), as compared with 241 m 1958 The death rate from the disease per 1,000 of the population was 2.27 The deaths from cancer constitute 18.5 per cent, of the total Battersea deaths during the year. The following gives the comparative average death rates from cancer in Battersea for quinquennial periods since 1901. 1901-1905 0.88 1941-1945 2.44 1906-1910 0.95 1946-1950 2.11 1911-1915 1.11 1951-1955 2.07 1916-1920 1.28 1956 2.05 1921-1925 1.33 1957 2.49 1926-1930 1.51 1958 2.18 1931-1935 1.75 1959 2.27 1936-1940 1.99 Details in age groups and the localisation of this disease will be found on page 11. Infant Mortality. During 1959 the deaths of 44 infants under 1 year of age were registered as belonging to Battersea. The total number of live births registered during the year was 2,030 giving an infant mortality rate of 21.67 per 1,000 live births as compared with 23.96 in 1958 and 22.33 in 1957 The infant mortality rate in England and Wales during 1959 was 22.0. 14 The following table sets out the causes of death in detail.

The death rate amongst illegitimate children during 1959 was 43.96 per 1,000 illegitimate live births, as compared with 34.48 in 1958. The corresponding death rate of legitimate children in 1959 was 19.48. The ratio of mortality rate of illegitimate infants to that of legitimate being 225 to 100. The corresponding figure for 1958 was Maternal Mortality. During 1959 there were two deaths from "diseases or accidents of child-birth," which is equivalent to a fatality rate of 0.97 per 1,000 birth (live and still). Both deaths, however, were due to self-induced abortion. There was one death during 1958. The rate for England and Wales in 1959 was 0.38.

During the year 1,187 notifications were received, which, when compared with 1,152 cases notified in 1958, shows an increase of 35. This is mainly due to the number of measles notifications received—702 as compared with 614 in 1958 (an increase of 88)—modified by a decrease in the number of notifications of dysentery and whooping cough. One case of diphtheria occurred during 1959 in a woman aged 25 years. It is thought that she contracted the disease from her son, who. it was later discovered, was a diphtheria carrier. She had not been immunised. This is the first case that has occurred within the Borough since 1953. There was a decrease in the number of dysentery cases notified, 167 as compared with 195 in 1958, but it will be remembered, during 1958, there was an outbreak in one of the schools within the Borough. Taking this outbreak into consideration, therefore, there was a sharp increase in the number of individual cases notified, 167, as compared with 63 in 1958. A total of 2,010 specimens were submitted for examination in connection with this disease. Two cases of para-typhoid occurred within the Borough during the year. In both cases the source of infection was not discovered. Thirteen cases of poliomyelitis were notified during 1959, 11 Paralytic and 2 non-paralytic. In the case of a nine-month-old girl the disease proved fatal. Only one case had been immunised. Analysis of Cases (after Correction of Diagnosis) of Infectious Disease Notified during the Year 1959.

In addition 63 cases were reported or otherwise came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, making a total of 138 cases for the year. The case rate per 1,000 population (excluding inward transfers) was 0.69 or 69.0 per 100,000. At the end of the year there were 1,095 pulmonary cases and 67 non-pulmonary cases of tuberculosis on the Register. This is equal to a morbidity rate per 1,000 population of 10.09 in the case of pulmonary, and 0.62 in the case of non-pulmonary tuberculosis or 10.71 both types. The tables on page 18 give details of additions and deletions of cases on the Register during the year. Deaths from Tuberculosis. During 1959 deaths from tuberculosis registered as belonging to the Borough of Battersea numbered 8, of which 7 were due to pulmonary tuberculosis. and 1 to another form of the disease. The death rates per 100,000 of the population during the 55 years ended1955 in quinquennial averages and the years 1951 to 1959 are given in the following table : — Years Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total 1901-1905 138.1 50.9 189.0 1906-1910 126.8 45.9 172.7 1911-1915 124.2 33.8 158.0 1916-1920 134.8 30.0 164.8 1921-1925 92.6 23.0 115.6 1926-1930 91.1 14.2 105.3 1931-1935 81.8 14.4 96.2 1936-1940 76.1 9.2 85.3 1941-1945 91.8 11.0 102.8 1946-1950 53.1 6.1 59.2 Average (50 years) 101.0 23.9 124.9 1951 39.3 3.4 42.7 1952 29.2 2.6 31.8 1953 12.2 4.4 16.6 1954 17.5 3.5 21.0 1955 12.3 — 12.3 Average (5 years 1951-55) 22.1 2.8 24.9 1956 12.4 0.9 13.3 1957 8.9 0.9 9.8 1958 15.4 2.7 18.1 1959 6.45 0.92 7.37 The death rate per 100,000 population was 8.5 for England and Wales. 18 Tuberculosis, 1959.

Diphtheria and whooping cough immunisation and vaccination against smallpox and poliomyelitis were carried out during the year under the arrangements made by the London County Council. 20 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The bacteriological examination of clinical material (with the exception of sputum which is dealt with at the Chest Clinic) was carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service, County Hall, Westminster Bridge, S.E.I. No charge is made to the Council for these examinations. During the year 2,126 examinations were made as follows : — Description Disease Number of Specimens Positive Results Faeces Dysentery or Food Poisoning 2,066 493 Faeces Typhoid or Paratyphoid Fever 35 2 Throat Swabs Diphtheria 25 — INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION and INOCULATION. At the request of the Ministry of Health arrangements are for the authentication, by the Medical Officer of Health, of certificate of vaccination and inoculation issued by medical practitioners in the Borough in respect of persons going abroad. During 1959, 464 certificates were authenticated. 21 Sanitary Circumstances. The following table sets out in summarised form the details of the main work of the Department in relation to sanitation:— Sanitary Operations. 1959.

During the year, legal proceedings were taken by the Council in 88 cases, for the enforcement of various Acts, By-laws, Regulations. etc., administered by the Health Department. A summary is set out below : — _ Cases Public Health (London) Act, 1936 81 Food and Drugs Act, 1955 2 Housing Act, 1957 5 88 Fines totalling £102 0s. 0d. were imposed in connection with these proceedings, and £31 10s. Od. costs were awarded to the Council. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions of this Act in regard to Nuisances continued to afford the main means whereby the remedy of insanitary conditions found in dwelling houses could be secured. During the year, 1,074 Intimation Notices (relating to 950 premises) and 554 Statutory (Nuisance) Notices (relating to 511 premises) were served. It was found necessary to refer 99 cases to the Council's Solicitor with instructions to take steps, by legal proceeding if necessary, to enforce compliance with Statutory Notices. In 18 of these cases a warning letter from the Solicitor had the desired effect. In the remaining 81 cases, however, summonses had to be issued. As a result, Nuisance Orders were made by the Court in 22 instances. The remaining 59 summonses were ultimately withdrawn, the Notices having been complied with subsequent to the issue of the summonses. Defective conditions in 1,086 houses were remedied—530 by owners following the service of Intimation Notices ; 544 by owners following the service of Statutory Notices, and in 12 cases action to enforce compliance with Nuisance Orders had to be taken, and the Council carried out the work in default of the persons on whom the Orders were made. In those cases, the Council were entitled to recover the cost of the works from those persons, and accounts were accordingly rendered to them. Dustbins. During the year, 15 notices were served under Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, concerning the provision of dustbins, and 48 dustbins were provided, 3 being supplied by the Council in default of the owners, from whom the cost was afterwards recovered. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955. Section 25 of the above Act relative to choked drains was used on 50 occasions. This Section enables a notice to be served upon an owner or occupier to clear a stopped-up drain, water closet or soil pipe within forty-eight hours. If the notice is not complied with the Council may carry out the work and recover the cost. It was necessary for the Council to do the work on 14 occasions. 23 Sections 26 enables the Council to re-instate a water supply to a dwelling after the supply has been withdrawn by the Metropolitan Water Board following a defect in the supply pipe or fittings. Notices were served on nine occasions and in two cases the Council did the work in default. Authority has been given by the Council to the Medical Officer of Health, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, and the Chief Public Health Inspector to serve Section 27 notices on behalf of the Council to remedy nuisances within a specific time where unreasonable delay would be occasioned by following the normal procedure. It was necessary to serve one such notice during the year. Drainage Work. Drainage work to new premises, reconstruction of drains to existing premises, and drainage in connection with conversion schemes, are carried out under the supervision of the officers of the Department. Drains were constructed to 60 new dwellings, and 239 plans of proposed work were deposited in connection with drainage generally. During the year, 103 drains were tested with smoke—55 of these were found to be defective. The water test was applied on 725 occasions to drains in the course of construction. 16 frontage drains (the length of drains between the house property to its connection with the sewer) were constructed or reconstructed. This work is carried out by the Council's workmen under the supervision of the Inspectors. Drainage and Watercloset By-laws made by the London County Council are enforced by the Council. Local Land Charges. Enquiries relating to Local Land Charges in connection with Notices by the Department, information concerning the issue of Disrepair Certificates, and the way in which premises are drained, are regularly received These enquiries require a careful search of records and drainage plans. During the year, 1,683 enquiries were dealt with. Water Supply. During the year 8 certificates under Section 95 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, were issued in respect of 60 new or re-erected dwellings. Fifty-eight notices of waste of water from defective fittings, etc., observed during routine inspections of various premises, were sent to the Metropolitan Water Board. Rag Dealers and Sorters. premises occupied by rag sorters in the Borough are subjected to regular inspection. During the year 109 inspections were made. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. This Act gives power generally to the Council to require steps to be taken to eradicate infestation of rats and mice and where possible to prevent infestations occurring. These duties are carried out by the Rodent Officer, assisted by two Rodent Operatives. 24 All infestations coming to light, whether by way of complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated, and the appropriate action taken. Where the cause of the trouble is obviously defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is called upon to effect the necessary repairs. This aspect of the work involves close co-operation between the Rodent Control Staff and the Public Health Inspectors. In the case of private dwellings the work of disinfestation is carried out by the Rodent Control Staff free of cost, and on request at business premises, where the cost is charged in full. Property Infested by Rats Major Minor Seriously infested by Mice Council's properties - 9 - Dwelling houses - 95 40 Business premises - 76 29 - 180 69 The total number of visits made to the above premises, and to others which were found not to be infested, was 3,231. The baiting of sewers under the control of the Council is carried out twice yearly, and the amount of poison bait taken is a measure of the success of the treatments. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had, up to the 31st March, 1959, made a grant of 50 per cent, towards the cost of the service. This grant has now ceased, but the standard of control is being maintained. The Ministry's technical, advisory and instructional service is still available to the Council's Officers, should it be required. Verminous Premises. During the year 342 premises which were found to be infested with vermin were disinfested. The insecticide used contains Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T. and gives a prolonged residual effect. Van Dwellings. There are three principal sites in the Borough where caravans or other types of moveable dwellings are situated. These sites are regularly inspected, and during the year 205 inspections were made. All have sufficient sanitary accommodation, a mains water supply, and are provided with sufficient dustbin accommodation. Under powers contained in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, the Council may grant licences authorising the use of the sites for moveable dwellings. After the " Appointed Day which is the 1st October, 1960, it will be an offence for any person to use or knowingly allow to be used any land occupied by him as a site for moveable dwellings, unless he holds a licence granted by the Council. The Council may attach to any licence granted such conditions as they think fit as to the number of moveable dwellings which may be kept on the land, the amount of space to be kept free between such dwellings, water supply, fire protection arrangements, sanitary conditions and the prevention of nuisance from noise. 25 Dangerous Structures. During the course of inspection for any purpose carried out by the officers of the Department, should any dangerous structure or any dangerous condition appertaining to a building be noticed, the District Surveyor of the London County Council is notified for any action he may decide to take. 129 such cases were notified. Shops Act, 1950. Three exemption certificates were issued under Section 38 of this Act, in respect of premises where restricted space precluded the provision on the premises of a separate water-closet for the use of male employees. In two cases satisfactory arrangements were made for the use of sanitary conveniences in adjoining premises. In the third case, where only one male employee was concerned, the certificate was issued on the understanding that a bolt and a "Vacant-Engaged" sign was affixed to the door of the sanitary convenience. 26 Atmospheric Pollution. Clean Air Act, 1956. Smoke Control Areas. The Council's No. 1 Smoke Control Order became operative on the 1st October, 1959. The area, comprising approximately 50 acres surrounding St. James's Hospital, is almost entirely residential. The Council decided to allow an extension of time for the receipt of applications up to the 31st March, 1960. By the end of the year, 266 applications had been received for the approval of the estimated costs of adaptations to 493 fireplaces; 248 of these applications had been approved, and the work had been satisfactorily completed in 119 cases—73 by owners and 46 by tenants. Grants amounting to £1,097 19s. Od. had been paid. Seven applications for payment of extra grant in addition to the statutory seven-tenths of seven-twentieths grant, on the grounds of hardship, were approved, the estimated additional cost to the Council being £22 12s. 0d. Applications were not received from all premises within the Area, and a survey was made which was in the nature of an enquiry and to advise the occupants again of the need to make application if they wished to apply for grant. The reason given in the majority of cases for taking no action in the matter was that the persons concerned were out at busines during the day, and open fires were not necessary. Electric, gas or oil burning appliances were used during the week, and if an open fire was required over the week-end, one of the authorised fuels was used, which could be burnt satisfactorily in the existing grate. It was pointed out that this type of fuel might not be easy to obtain, and that the conversion of the fireplace to one capable of burning some of the more reactive cokes which were in good supply would be advisable. However, providing an authorised fuel was used no action could be taken. An additional Investigator was appointed to commence on the inspection of the Council's second Area, which is planned to adjoin the No. 1 Area, and extend from Nightingale Lane to the south side of Broomwood Road. This work is proceeding, and information being obtained of the number of fireplaces which may require conversion. At the same time, advice is given, and an explanatory leaflet left With each occupier. Smoke, etc., Nuisances and Observations. During the year, 21 complaints were made alleging nuisances from smoke, dust, grit, etc., emitted from premises in various parts of the Borough. All these complaints received careful and sometimes prolonged investigation. In addition to dealing with specific complaints, observations are kept upon the chimneys of any industrial plant which merits observation, and the appropriate action taken. A total number of 178 observations were made. No notices were served. 27 Smoke Measuring Station. The smoke measuring station installed in the Department in 1956 continues to give valuable information concerning smoke density and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The readings are taken by members of the staff of the Department, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research receive the results and collate the information with other results obtained from Authorities all over the Country The following graphs show the readings obtained throughout 1958 and 1959. 28 Exemption of Premises engaged in Investigation and Research. Section 21 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, provides for firms engaged in research with regard to air pollution and the efficiency of furnaces generally to apply for exemption in the event of emission of smoke above the prescribed density. One application for exemption under this Section was received, and this was granted for one year. No untoward emissions were observed. Notification of Installation of Furnaces. Notification is made in accordance with Section 3 of the Act, which provides that the installation of any boiler with a heating capacity of 55,000 or more British Thermal Units per hour must be notified to the Local Authority. Four such notifications were made, and all were in respect of oil-fired furnaces. Alkali, etc., Works Order, 1958.

(A)—INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES. The regular inspection of all food premises where food for human consumption is sold or stored is carried out as a routine. The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and regulations made thereunder, is the principal Act under which action is taken. FOOD PREMISES. As at 31st December, 1959. Milk Distributors 141 Wholesale Milk Dealers (registered as Dairymen) 1 Restaurants, Cafes 153 Canteens, Kitchens 75 Butchers 69 Horseflesh (for human consumption) 1 Ice Cream (Sale) 266 Ice Cream (Manufacture) 3 Pish Shops (Wet and Fried) 44 Food Factories 21 Bakehouses (Not underground) 16 Bakehouses (Underground) 3 Preserved Food 118 Bakers 51 Greengrocers 83 Confectioners 210 Grocers and Provisions 268 Miscellaneous (Chemists, Public Houses, Off-Licences) 203 Stalls:— Grocers 3 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 64 Fish and/or Poultry 7 There are 1,099 food premises in the Borough, together with 74 food stalls. Some of the premises shown above are listed under more than one trade category. Dairies and Milk Distributors. At the end of the year there were 142 premises in the Borough registered for the sale of milk. One of these premises, occupied by a wholesale dealer, was registered as a dairy. The occupiers of the remaining 141 premises were registered as milk distributors. All these premises were visited during the year, and 2 notices concerning non-compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations were served. In accordance with the Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959, registrations of distributors of milk are now required to be effected only with the Local Authority in whose area the premises are situated. The 28 distributors selling milk in Battersea from premises in other Boroughs are therefore no longer registered in Battersea. 30 Milk (Special Designation) Regulations. Under the above Regulations three designations are prescribed— Tuberculin Tested, Pasteurised and Sterilised. Tuberculin Tested milk must be supplied in a properly closed container. If the container is a bottle, the cap must bear the address of the premises at which the bottle was filled and the words " Tuberculin Tested Milk." Any other type of container must be closed with a tightly fitting cover and suitably sealed and labelled. Pasteurised milk must be delivered in containers closed at the dairy where they were filled, with a cap or cover over-lapping the lip of the container and labelled " Pasteurised Milk." All persons who pasteurise or sterilise, or deal in special designation milk, are required to hold licences, which (except in the case of producers of raw milk) are issued by Food and Drugs Authorities. The Milk (Special Designation) (Specified Areas) Order, 1951. requires that all milk sold by retail (other than in catering establishments as part of a meal or refreshment) in the areas specified must be sold under one or other of the special designations. The whole of the County of London is included in such areas. The number of licences issued by the Council for 1959 was as follows:— Full Supplementary Tuberculin Tested 89 21 Pasteurised 112 21 Sterilised 137 23 338 65 One licence to sterilise milk was issued, and is included in the above figures. Details of examination of samples of pasteurised and sterilised milk are given on page 37. Ice Cream Premises. Section 16 (a) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, provides for the registration of premises used for the sale, or manufacture for the purpose of sale, of ice cream, or the storage of ice cream intended for sale. The number of premises registered at the end of the year was 269. Prior to registration, the premises are inspected as to suitability before recommendation to the Health Committee. The majority of applications are for the sale of pre-packed ice cream from refrigerated containers. Particular attention is paid to premises where manufacture takes place, and samples of the product are taken for examination. There are six premises in the Borough where ice cream is manufactured. New or amended regulations relative to ice cream came into force during the year. 31 (1) The Food Standards {Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959. These Regulations revoke and replace the Food Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1953. The regulations prescribe amended standards for ice cream and for "Parev" (kosher) ice and introduce separate standards for dairy ice cream (or dairy cream ice or cream ice) and for milk ice. The standards for dairy ice cream and for milk ice provide that they shall Contain no fat other than milk fat except such as may be introduced by the use of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent. The requirement in the 1953 Order that ice-cream should contain not less than 10 per cent, of sugar is replaced by a Provision that no type of ice cream shall contain any artificial sweetener. (2) The Labelling of Food (Amendment) Regulations, 1959. These Regulations amend the Labelling of Food Order, 1953, by new provisions relating to Ice Cream. They prohibit the labelling, marking, or advertising of ice cream in a manner suggestive of butter, cream, milk, or anything connected with the dairy interest, unless the ice cream contains no fat other than milk fat, but permit the presence of milk solids to be declared. The Regulations also provide that it will be an offence after the 30th November, 1959, to sell under the description "Ice Cream" any pre-packed ice cream which contains fat, other than milk fat, unless it bears on the wrapper a declaration contains non-milk fat", or, if appropriate, " Contains vegetable fat (3) The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1959. These Regulations consolidate and amend the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947-1952. They require that ingredients used in the manufacture of ice cream are to be pasteurised by one or other of three specified methods, or sterilised and thereafter kept at a low temperature until the freezing process is begun. The Regulations make it an offence to sell or offer for sale ice cream that has not been so treated, or which has been allowed to reach a temperature exceeding 28° it, without it again being treated. They exempt from the requirments as to pasteurisation or sterilisation certain types of Water Ices or Ice Lollies which are sufficiently acid to make such treatment unnecessary. Butchcrs' Shops. There are 70 butchers' shops in the Borough. All these shops are symetically inspected, 818 visits having been made during the year. twenty-one notices concerning non-compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations were served.

Offensive Trades. There are two premises in the Borough at which the scheduled offensive trade of fat melting is carried on. The firms concerned have been established for many years, and the trades are conducted satisfactorily. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. The principal provisions of the Act relate to registration premises in which rag flock or other materials are used in upholstery, etc., and the licensing of premises used for the manufacture and storage of rag flock. An authorised officer of the Council has the right of entry, inspection and sampling of any filling materials. The Medical Officer of Health and Public Health Inspectors are deemed to be authorised officers.

There are 7 premises in the Borough at which filling materials other than rag flock are used, and these are registered. There are no premises at present dealing with rag flock. Twelve visits were made to registered premises during the year but no contravention of the Act was discovered. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. Regulations under the above Act prescribe that heating appliances suitable for use in a dwelling house or other residential premises shall be fitted with a robustly made guard securely attached to the appliance, and shall satisfy certain other tests set out in a Schedule to the Regulations. It has been found, since the passing of the Act, that almost without exception appliances on sale are sold to a British Standard specification, which gives the double assurance of their being subject to inspection at the place of manufacture. Occasional cases of second-hand appliances of an old type being offered for sale may occur, however, and a constant watch is kept for such appliances. 43 Barbers and Hairdressers. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, Action 18, gave the Council authority to register barbers or hairdressers and their premises, and no person should carry on such a business unless both he and the premises are registered. Any person registered under this Section must keep displayed in the premises in respect of which he is registered a copy of his certificate of registration and of any by-laws made by the Council. At the end of the year there were 69 registered premises in the Borough, and 71 inspections were carried out. Pet Animals Act, 1951. The object of the Act is to regulate the sale of pet animals, particular reference to their welfare while kept for sale in pet shops.

Licences were issued in respect of 12 shops and 24 visits were made during the year. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act is chiefly concerned with the distribution by sale or otherpoisonous substances. The list of poisons is contained in an Order made under the Act. This Order is divided into Part I and Part II. With the poisons contained in Part I, the Council are not concerned, since an "authorised seller " is a pharmacist registered with the pharmaceutical Society, and enforcement is entrusted to Inspectors appointed by that Society. Substances specified in Part II may be sold by "listed sellers and these are persons who, on written application in a prescribed form, and on payment of stated fees, are recorded by the Council as " persons entitled to sell poisons in Part II of the Poisons List" at the premises recorded on the List. The Council are required to enforce the Act and Orders so far as they relate to " listed sellers " and have appointed the Public Health Inspectors as Inspectors under the Act.

The twelve areas concerned are situated in the Culvert Road, the Winstanley Road and the Battersea High Street areas. Following a Public Inquiry concerning three areas represented in 1957, the Orders were subsequently confirmed. A request was received from the Housing Committee as to the possibility of obtaining a detailed survey under the Housing Act of the Winstanley Road Area, in the shortest possible time, by the existing staff of Inspectors. The Health Committee agreed for the work to be undertaken by a re-arrangement of the normal work of the Inspectors. and for work outside normal office hours to be undertaken. The survey was carried out within the prescribed time, and 845 houses were inspect in detail. This information was submitted to the Housing Committee who were able to reach a conclusion as to the best method of dealing with the Area.

The following table shows the work carried out during the year connection with Certificates of Disrepair:— Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) received 103 Decisions to issue Certificates of Disrepair (Form J) 104 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) 83 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) accepted 61 Certificates of Disrepair (Form L) issued 50 Certificates of Disrepair refused 8 Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair (Form M) received 82 Cancellations of Certificates of Disrepair (Form N) issued 57 Applications for Certificates re undertakings (Form O) received from landlords 133 Applications for Certificates re undertakings (Form O) received from tenants 41 Certificates re undertakings (Form P) issued to landlords 134 Certificates re undertakings (Form P) issued to tenants 42 in comparison with 1958, the volume of work decreased. This was due to a decline in applications by tenants for Certificates of Diserpair from 350 in 1958 to 103 in 1959. There was, however, an increase in the number of applications from landlords for certificates relating to undertakings they had given to tenants. Housing Accommodation Applications. All applications made to the Council are normally dealt with by the Housing Manager, who refers to me those cases in which the application is based wholly or partly on medical grounds. These cases include applications for transfer from Council tenants and licensees of requisitioned premises. He also refers certain cases in which some special feature is involved (e.g., fitness of basement rooms). During 1959 a total of 351 cases were dealt with on the grounds of ill-health or unsuitable accommodation. The maximum number of points on medical grounds other than pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated to 7 applications and 8 cases were referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration on these grounds. In 11 cases the maximum points were given for pulmonary tuberculosis, two of these being referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration as the accommodation was inadequate. In 20 cases of transfer applications, rehousing was recommended as essential on medical grounds. The London County Council notify cases in which the application to that Council alleges sanitary defects. The houses are inspected, and action to secure the remedy of any defects found is taken. 46 Miscellaneous Matters. Conferences. The Council were officially represented at the undermentioned Conferences dealing with matters within the purview of the Public Health Department.

Lewis, Factories and Workshops Inspector. Care of the Aged. Health and Social problems arising in the elderly have been referred to the Public Health Department from many sources in the past year. The aim has been, wherever possible, to prevent physical deterioration and breakdown by the support of social agencies. This requires the full co-operation of the old person concerned, and where this cannot be obtained, the means of helping are severely limited. For those not requiring nursing, admission to an Old Persons' Home is sought through the Welfare Department of the London County Council. Many such cases have been admitted during the past year. Where hospital treatment is indicated, full co-operation and assistance have been available from local hospitals. Many patients after a spell in hospital recover sufficiently to justify discharge home, where they are assisted by statutory and voluntary bodies. When all other measures have failed, compulsory removal under the National Assistance Acts has to be considered as a last but necessary step to be taken in the best interests of the old person. In all these approaches to the problem, very close integration is needed with the relatives of old persons, general practitioners and hospitals. Use of Slipper Baths by Old Age Pensioners. The Council make available to old age pensioners free use of the slipper baths at their Baths Establishments (with use of a towel) on production of their pension books. This facility has also been extended to blind persons. 47 During the year 1959 this arrangement was taken advantage of the respective Baths Establishments as follows:— Males Females Latchmere 3,846 4,022 Nine Elms 1,035 453 Plough Road 1,171 1,120 Total 6,052 5,595 Public Swimming Baths. The Council maintain four public swimming pools—three at Latchmere Baths and one at Nine Elms Baths. The source of water supply at the Latchmere Baths is from deep wells. In the event of breakdown or any temporary cessation of supply from the wells, the water is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. The Nine Elms Baths are supplied from the Board's mains. The Bath water is effectively chlorinated, and there is a turnover or change of water in the Baths approximately every 3½ hours. Samples of water from the swimming pools are taken at fortnightly intervals and submitted for bacteriological examination. The results have been consistently satisfactory. Public Lavatory Accommodation. Five public conveniences for both sexes and one for females only are Provided by the Council in various parts of the Borough, two being underground. All the lavatory accommodation at each of the conveniences is provided free, and, in the interests of public health, free washing facilities are also available. Two Public urinals are maintained, and in addition the urinals attached to ten licensed premises are, by arrangement with the owners, available to the general public. Accidents in the Home. In last year's report I dealt at some length with the problem of accidents in the home particularly the inadequacy of existing information on this subject. It will be remembered that I included a table covering the years 1956, 1957 and 1958, incorporating figures calculated from reports made by the London Ambulance Service. I emphasised that these figures were not absolutely accurate, but they probably gave a reasonably accurate picture of the home accidents which had occurred in Battersea. The table is extended this year by the inclusion of figures for 1959. They are again under the disadvantage of being calculated and not actual figures. Assuming, however, that they do not vary very much from what the actual figure is, it will be seen that the number of home accidents were fewer in 1959, there being 22.1 home accidents per ten thousand of the population, compared with 23.7 in 1958. In actual proportions the incidence of the age-groups and the types of accidents have not varied very markedly. Too much attention should not be paid to these returns, but it is at least satisfying to know that apparently there was no marked increase in home accidents during 1959. 48 The means of preventing home accidents remains as outlined last year's report. That is to say, efforts must be directed mainly towards the education of the public, chiefly through the work of our Health Visitors and Public Health Inspectors, as a part of their daily routing duties in the field of health education. In addition, other statutory and voluntary organisations are playing an important part. HOME ACCIDENTS IN BATTERSEA, 1956 -1959. Table 1 Total Year Age group (years) M. F.

Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are responsible for the burial or cremation of the body of any person dying or being found dead, in the Borough, and have power to recover from the estate of the deceased person, or from any person who, under the Act, was liable to maintain the deceased immediately prior to his death, their expenses incurred in carrying out the duty, in so far as these expenses are not covered by any grant made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. During the year, 9 cases were dealt with. The burials arranged by the Council are carried out by a local undertaker under contract, and not more than one coach is provided for followers. The Health Department make the arrangements and collect all available information regarding any estate left by the deceased, particulars of his National Insurance, and the existence of any " liable " relatives. This information is passed to the Borough Treasurer so that he may take steps to recover the cost. The total cost incurred in dealing with the 9 cases was £145 approximately, and of this amount £83 was recovered. Personal Cleansing Station. There are facilities for treatment of scabies and verminous conditions at the Personal Cleansing Station, Sheepcote Lane. During the year 284 treatments were given to persons suffering from or contacts of scabies—117 to adults, 119 to school children, and 48 to children under school age. In addition to the above, 104 adults and 1,092 children found to be verminous were cleansed. Of the 1,092 children, 983 attended from local schools by arrangement with the London County Council, who have entered into a contract with the Council for the use of the Personal cleansing Station. The cleansing and treatment of the school children is carried out under the supervision of officers of the London County Council, while the disinfestation of clothing and, if necessary, of the homes is carried out by the Borough Council's staff. The following table shows the number of treatments at the personal Cleansing Station and the expenditure incurred since 1950:— Year Adults Children Expenditure *Amount Contributed 1950 Verminous and Scabies Verminous and Scabies £ £ 1951 226 2,238 1,750 410 1952 200 1,858 1,992 406 1953 176 1,994 1,956 535 1954 144 1,943 1,932 508 1955 214 2,499 1,966 512 1956 246 2,318 2,371 526 1957 262 1,517 2,681 547 1958 289 1,535 3,202 553 1959 288 1,756 2,536 560 221 1,259 2,259 560 Financial year ending 31st March. Other columns, calendar year. 50 The contract with the London County Council, referred to above, provides for the payment by them of 3s. 6d. for each treatment given. whether for vermin or for scabies, with a minimum payment of £500 per annum. Arrangements have been made with the Wandsworth Boroug Council, and the Lambeth Borough Council, for certain of the residents in those Boroughs, who require treatment or cleansing, to attend at the Battersea Personal Cleansing Station, the cost of this service being borne by the respective Boroughs in which the patients are resident. During the year 152 treatments were given to Wandsworth residents and 44 treatments to Lambeth residents. Methods of Treatment:— Scabies: Persons attending for treatment are given a hot bath for twenty to thirty minutes, thoroughly dried, and Benzyl Benzoate applied to the whole of the body. This is repeated on alternate days there being three treatments in all. Verminous heads: The hair is treated with a preparation containing cotton-seed oil, tar oil, paraffin oil and oil of lemon grass, and then washed with a shampoo of soft soap and borax. It is then dried thoroughly, combed with a Sacker's comb to remove nits, washed. dried and combed again. The operation takes approximately half an hour for each child, and a final check is made by the Sister in attendance. The Council have two fiats attached to the Personal Cleansing Station for the temporary use in emergency of people or a family displaced, usually following fumigating procedure. The Council have agreed that these shelters may be used for Wandsworth residents at an annual fee of £25 for the right to use the shelters and a weekly charge of £1 10s. Od. per shelter for every case sent there. Disinfection and Disinfestation. Methods of Disinfection: Following the notification of a case of infectious disease requiring disinfection, an inspection is made and the following methods used. The patient's room is sprayed with a formaldehyde solution. The doors and windows are closed and the room can be used again after five or six hours. Bedding and clothing are collected and steam treated at the Station. where the disinfection plant consists of two large steam disinfectors. Sheets, pillow cases and hand towels are exposed to formalin vapour in a special chamber prior to being washed in the adjoining laundry. Books and other articles which cannot be steam disinfected are also treated by exposure to a formalin vapour. Disinfestation of Verminous Rooms : Articles in the room requiring treatment are removed for steam disinfestation. The room is sprayed with an insecticide containing Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T., which gives a prolonged residual effect. In the case of a heavy infestation, architraves and mouldings are required to be eased for deeper Penetration of the insecticide. Control of Insect Pests: The construction by the Council of large blocks of flats containing covered ducts taking hot water, plumbing and drainage pipes has raised a problem of insect infestation. These ducts form an ideal harbourage for insects which would be difficult 51 to deal with by normal hand spraying. A Microsol Mist Generator has been purchased by the Council, and this fitting, having a small motor unit, is capable of spraying a fine mist or fog of insecticide to a distance of 50 feet, the mist settling out on to the surfaces of the duct and the piping contained therein. This fitting is in use and is proving very successful. Coroner's Court and Mortuary. Details as to the number of inquests held at the Coroner's Court, and bodies received into the Mortuary, during 1959, are set out in the following table:— Battersea Mortuary, 1959.
