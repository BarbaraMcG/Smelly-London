TO The Board of works for the lewis ham District FOR THE YEAR 1865, BY F. E. WILKINSON, M.D., L.R.C.P.E., M.R.C.S., L.A.C., Medical Officer of Health for the Lewisham District; Medical Officer to North Surrey District School; Surgeon P Division of Police. Gentlemen, In my report of lust year I had to speak of the increased rate of mortality of the district—an increased rate which was shared by the whole of the metropolitan district. I have this year to shew you that the statistics are of a more favourable character; and although I should wish that the deaths from the preventable (epidemic) class of diseases (those diseases which we firmly believe might be annihilated by strict sanitary regulations) were materially lessened in number, yet the mortality from these diseases bears a more favourable aspect, and it is therefore to be hoped that our constant attempts to remedy defects in ventilation, drainage, water supply, &c., are not without their fruits in this district. From the acknowledged salubrity of the neighbourhood, it has been and is now the frequent resort of invalids, who resido here in the hope of recruiting their shattered health; and this fact is a means occasionally of swelling the mortality tables of the district. Again, as I pointed out in my report of last year, we have public institutions which contribute largely to the population of the district; these, especially in the case of the Union Workhouse, add from external sources to the mortality of the district. But if the mortality is increased from these causes in the Lewisham Parish, the low mortality of the North Surrey District School reduces the rate as far as regards the hamlet of Penge. There are many localities in the district which still require the most anxious care as to drainage, and many localities 6 which have yet to feel the benefit of sanitary regulations. I have in my monthly reports laid before you the results of my enquiries and observations upon this subject, which shew that a very large number of houses are as yet drained into cesspools; that many houses even abutting on the lines of sewers are not drained into those sewers; and that in many instances greater attention is required to tho ventilation of drains. Many of the poorer neighbourhoods require constant supervision, in order that the efforts of the Board to enforce sanitary regulations may not be nullified by the apathy and carelessness of the inhabitants themselves. Many houses also in the district arc still without water supply, which is essential for carrying out sewer drainage, and some have to fetch water from a distance. In some instances in this district houses have been placed so closely together that there is deficient circulation of air. It seems to me to be essential that the powers of the Board should be more extended, so as to prevent houses being placed in such close proximity as to be detrimental to the health of the inhabitants. The statistical information as to the births and deaths registered in the parish is derived from the weekly returns of the registrars to the registrar-general, and refer to the registrar's sub-districts, the estimated population of which is as follows : SUB-DISTRICTS.

Water Supply. In my first report to the Board of Works, dated January, 1856, and in the last published report for the year 1864, as well as at other times, I directed your attention to the importance of a supply of pure water. In both these reports I also directed your attention to the certain connection between tainted water and cholera, and endeavoured to show you that although at all times disease of thix kind was not to be looked for as a result of imbibing impure water, still that poisons contained in water were introduced into the system in such a subtle form, and in such an unobserved manner, that extreme danger was incurred, and diseases introduced into the system which might be avoided, if the supply of water were pure. This subject still demands very serious consideration. Tnder tho present system of water supply the means of contamination are two-fold. 1st, there is danger lest the source of supply should be contaminated (for this danger the companies must be held responsible); 2nd, there is danger from the decomposition and contamination of water in the receptacles used for storage. Of this latter source of danger 1 have had abundant evidence, as it is quite the exception to find cisterns clean, properly covered, and unconnected with watercloset contamination; indeed you are well aware of the very frequent complaints on this head which have come before you; and the only remedy which I think would be at all effectual would be a continuous supply. A number of details would have to be considered in affording a supply of this kind, as to iron piping instead of lead, iron water waste preventing taps, and occasional supervision. I feel convinced that this kind of supply would be productive of saving to the water companies by preventing 10 the waste of water from overflow; it would be a benefit to owners of house property, as it would save the necessity for cisterns for storage; and it would be an incalculable benefit to the consumers, especially those of the poorer class. It would greatly diminish sickness (especially from zymotic disease), and would greatly improve the tone of the poorer class, who pay little attention to the cleansing of cisterns, and prefer drinks supposed to be of a cleaner kind to swallowing a repulsive looking impure water; indeed if cisterns were placed more generally within view, few people would wish to partake of their contents. I would again mention to you the condition of drains as a subject which demands constant care. Under the present system of drainage, many houses are supplied with sinks, waterclosets, baths, &c., within the house, all of which communicate directly with the sewer. These communications are essentially chimneys to the drain, and, unless the sewer be most carefully ventilated, are constantly apt (especially when the internal air of the dwelling is rarified by warmth) to pour poisonous gases into the house. In many cases this happens from carelessness in trapping, or by leaving traps to drains open, and, aided by the neglect to ventilate houses at night, is doubtless a frequent source of illness and loss of life. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. EACIIUS WILKINSON, M.D. 11 DEATHS DURING THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE YEAR 1865. CLASESS OF DISEASE. CAU8E8 OF DEATH. AGES AT DEATH. Total.
