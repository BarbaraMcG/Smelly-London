Surveyors' Annual Report. 29 SURVEYOR'S ANNUAL REPORT, For the Year ending 25th March, 1890. mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honor to submit my Twentieth Annual Report for the year ending the 25th March last. I have to report that the completion of the fifth year of the C???tract with the Improved Wood Paving Company for the F???ing of the Carriageway of the Borough High Street with ???od, terminated in May last. The pavement was laid in May, 15, and in accordance with the contract the wood blocks must reinstated with new at the end of the five years, the time I ???mated the life of the paving in this street. I may mention that the terms of the Contract between the Vestry and the Improved Wood Paving Company are shortly as ???ows: "That the Company shall pave the Carriageway, Brough High Street with Wood as specified, and maintain the ??? in good repair for twenty years, and that at the end of every the years during the contract the Company shall repave with new 30 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. wood blocks, or oftener if so required, receiving payment for the same at the rate of 2/- per square yard per annum, the firs payment to be made at the end of twelve months after the completion of the work." I have to state that in my opinion the Company have fulfilled the terms of the Contract in a satisfactory manner to the pres??? time, and in making this statement I would respectfully suggest the Vestry the adoption of a similar contract as to the Carriage way, London Road, as the most economical and efficient mann of repaving the Carriageway of this most important thoroughfar The repairs that have been done from time to time in the London. Road have been unsatisfactory, and the repairs that are now needs will involve a considerable cost. If a similar Contract were adopted with the Wood Paving Company for London Road as in t??? Borough High Street, it will be very little in excess of the cost relaying, and the old Granite Cubes will be available for paving side streets where the traffic is not heavy. The first instalme???. to the Company will be payable twelve months after the tion of the work (about £400). Against this would be the value the Old Cubes, which may be dressed and laid by the Vestry workmen. The Vestry's workmen relaid the Paving on the southe side of the carriageway Old Kent Road, from Darwin Street to Kinglake Street, at a cost of 1/2½ per square yard. It will necessary without delay to relay the Carriageway Paving on t northern side of the road from Waleran Buildings to Boundary. The Brunswick Rock Asphalte Paving Company have la?? 1,191 square yards of Asphalte in the Parish during the past year. Surveyor's Annual Report. 31 for mating a total quantity of Asphalte laid in the Parish since 1882 by his Company of 19,960 square yards, including Carriageways and Footways in 33 Streets. The work has been done to my satisfaction. The Vestry's workmen have repaved the Footways, Tower Street, with new inch York Paving, the cost including material being at the rate of 6/3½ per square yard. The nuisance of the Borough Road Railway Bridge still continues unabated, and I fear unless the Vestry adopt stringent measures in the shape of legal proceedings against the Company, no effort will be made by them to remedy the evil. As directed by the Vestry I have prepared plans and return as the Roads in the district, suggested to be taken as Main Roads, by he London County Council; also the plans of Gun Street, Facon Court, Wickham Gardens, part of King's Bench Walk, as???sanitary areas, and detail plans and sections of the same. I have prepared a report of the number of Footways and C riageways in the Parish requiring repaving, a copy of which has been sent to each member of the Roads Committee, but no de???sion in the matter has yet been arrived at. No car having been run over the tram lines, in the St. Gorge's Road, for over twelve months, I should recommend the Vestry to call upon the South London Tramway Company to remove the tramrails and make good the paving; the same being ???any places sunken below the tramrails. 32 Parish of Saint Georgt the Martyr, Southwark. The Contractors, Messrs. Ponsford & Son of Brixton has planted 84 fresh Trees in place of the dead ones during the months of November and December last. The additional space given to the fresh trees ordered by the Vestry will, I feel confider be of very great benefit to them, and if carried out to all the tree in the Parish would prevent many of them dying.
