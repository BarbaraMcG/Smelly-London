Total Number of New Buildings. 42 86 31 12 79 Notice having been received for the erection and drainage of 8 houses, on the site of Nos. 1 to 19, Eisdon Street, it was resolved that a length of 12-inch pipe be laid from the sewer in Neptune Street for the drainage thereof, and be laid to a level to meet future requirements ; that combined drainage be not allowed for more than two adjoining houses, that the necessary gulleys be formed, and that the rainwater pipes be not allowed to drain over the pavement. Subsequently an amended plan was submitted, providing for the erection of seven houses only in lieu of eight. A plan and section for this sewer were prepared by the Surveyor of Sewers and forwarded to the London County Council for their approval, which they gave, subject to the same being laid in concrete. The Surveyor's estimate for thia work, including manhole and two gulleys and ventilator, was £75. Notice and application having been received for the erection of eight houses within the limits of the area formerly occupied by the ten houses in Donne Place, which had been condemned as unfit for human habitation and pulled down, it was resolved that a 12-inch pipe drain be executed in continuation of the existing drain in Paradise Street up to the north end of the 15 said place, and that combined drainage be not allowed for more than two adjoining houses, and the London County Council's sanction was obtained conditionally to the pipe sewer being laid in concrete. The Surveyor's estimate was £33, and the work has been carried out. An Urinal to accommodate two persons has been fixed close to the buttress of the Railway Arch of the South Eastern Railway in the Rotherhithe New Road, with entrance facing the roadway, at an estimated cost of £46 12s., and an agreement entered into with the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company for the supply of water thereto. Messrs. John Hoare & Son, of 74, Blackfriars Road, are the Contractors for the Sewers jobbing works as per Schedule of prices. (For particulars of contract see p. 9.) Paving Works. Consequent upon the re-erection of the houses in Donne Place, a footway has been formed thereto as follows:- In front of Nos. 1, 2 and 3, 2 feet 6 inches wide, including the kerb, and the other portion pitched with old stone from Depot; and from Nos. 4 to 8 the whole width has been paved with tar paving 3 inches thick, and a small gulley 2 feet square provided opposite No. G. A lamp has been fixed on a standard opposite Nos. 5 and 6, and four wooden posts fixed across the entrance from Paradise Street opposite No. 3. The Paving of carriageway, Albion Street, with new Aberdeen granite cubes upon 9 inches of concrete, and other incidental work to kerb and footways has been completed by Mr. J. H. Etheridge, under his Contract with the Vestry at a cost of £3,412 5s. 8d. It has been decided to pave with patent Victoria stone the footways of the following streets:— St. Helena Road. Corbetts Lane, from Nos. 1 to 37. Rotherhithe New Road, from the south side of the private roadway leading to the South Eastern Railway Company's Arches to their Bricklayers Arms Branch Railway bridge, also in front of Bermondsey Parish Slop Shoot. 16 Neptune Street, by Messrs. Brandram's ; also that Adam Street be kerbed with new Granite kerb on both sides throughout the whole length of the street, the channelling redressed and relaid, and footways taken up, squared and relaid; new stone to be used where necessary; and Swan Lane kerb to be relaid as far as it will go and any deficiency be made up with new Kerb; the channels relaid and the footways relaid where necessary. In October, 1892, the Vestry resolved to take up, redress, and relay upon 4 inches of concrete the carriageway of Union Road on the south side of the tramway, from the Park entrance opposite Paradise Street to the boundary of the Parish at Millpond Bridge, and on the north side from Prospect Place to the boundary ; and invited tenders for carrying out the same. Messrs. Woodham, Fry and Fry's prices being the lowest, their tender was accepted at 3s. 8d. per yard superficial, and new stone to be provided and laid where necessary at 14s. per yard suporficial. It was subsequently decided to relay the kerb and footways, and this work was also entrusted to Messrs. Woodham, Fry and Fry, and the whole is nearly completed at an estimated cost of about £650. The wages of W. J. Kitchen, Road Foreman, have been increased from 32s. to 36s. per week J. J. Chapman has been appointed Foreman Pavior at a salary of £2 10s. per week. Paving Jobbing Works. Mr. James Henry Etheridge is the Contractor for Paving Jobbing Works at a Schedule of prices. (For particulars of same see page 9.) Lighting. The total number of ordinary lamps lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Company is 478, at a cost of £3 3s. 9d. per lamp per annum. Five special lamps, namely: at urinal, Derrick Street; entrance to Park, Lower Road; corner of Gomm Road; at entrance to Vestry Offices, Lower Road; and in Union Road, opposite Paradise Street, at rates varying from £5 11s. Od. to £9 1s. Od. per lamp per annum, and four Suggs' lamps by meter at 2s. 3d. per 1,000 feet, less 5 per cent. discount upon payment of account within one month from quarter day. 17 Lamps are maintained over urinals, Union Bridge, and opposite "John Bull" public-house, Southwark Park Road, at the joint expense of this Parish and Bermondsey. The Vestry bear the expense of lighting the tower clock of Christ Church, Union Road, but on the 5th April, 1892, they resolved to discontinue the payment in respect of the cost of the labour for lighting the same. Cleansing and Watering. Messrs. A. T. Hobman & Son still contract for the supply of men, horses, and carts, and for the removal of the sweepings from the whole of the roads and streets to a shoot to be provided by them. Messrs. A. T. Hobman & Son also continue to contract for the supply of horses, harness, and drivers for the Vestry's water vans. Dusting. Messrs. J. Martin & Sons, of Endwell Road, Brockley, are the Contractors for the removal of Dust, Ashes, &c., out of the Parish, also for the removal of Trade refuse at 4s. per yard. Sanitary. The adequacy of the Sanitary Staff has been fully considered by a Special Committee of the Vestry, and upon their report the Vestry were satisfied that all present requirements would be met by an addition to the Clerical staff, and they resolved to appoint an additional Clerk from 16 to 18 years of age with a knowledge of shorthand, at a salary of £50 a year, to perform the clerical work of the Sanitary department and to assist generally in the Vestry Office when not so engaged. It was at the same time decided to make no alteration in the present terms and duties of the appointment of the Medical Officer of Health. Mr. Reuben John Walker was on the 28th June, 1892, appointed Junior Clerk (Sanitary department), at a salary of £50 per annum. A communication was received from the Assistant Commissioner of Police upon the question of disinfecting Cabs which may have conveyed a person suffering from any dangerous or con agious disease, and the Sanitary Inspector having reported such disinfection could bo carried out by the Vestry Officials, it was 18 Resolved—That upon application being made at the Vestry Offices for the disinfection of Cabs, the Sanitary Inspector be instructed to have the same carried out as suggested by him. The Vestry have Resolved, That the present Sanitary Committee, consisting of the whole of the members of the Vestry, be appointed a Committee for the purposes of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with power to serve and receive notices, take proceedings and empower any Officer of the Vestry to make complaints and take proceedings in their behalf and otherwise to execute the said Act. The Medical Officer of Health having drawn the attention of the Vestry to the immigration of paupers from foreign countries into England and to their being the means of bringing such a complaint as Cholera, and to some extent paralysing the shipping trade, it was Resolved—To write the Local Government Board upon the subject. The Vestry received an invitation from the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, to appoint three delegates to represent them at a Conference to be held at the Town Hall, Caxton Street, upon the best method of obtaining the practical application of the opinion that the immigration of destitute foreigners should be prohibited, or placed under judicious regulations, when Messrs. F. T. Talbot, W. G. Wells, and R. J. Wood were appointed to represent the Vestry at such Conference. At a meeting of the Conference it was Resolved—That a deputation be appointed to wait upon the President of the Local Government Board upon the subject. A letter was afterwards received from the Honorary Secretary to the Conference, transmitting copy of a letter received from the Assistant Secretary to the Local Government Board, stating the President did not consider it necessary to see a deputation on the subject as suggested, and that the question as to the restriction on the immigration of aliens is one for the Board of Trade rather than for that Department. The Medical Officer of Health having reported receipt of a letter from the Secretary of the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the Poor, enclosing lists of houses in the Parish which were alleged to be in an insanitary condition, and having explained the nature of the complaints, which related more particularly to the want of proper water supply to water closets, it was 19 Resolved—That notices be served in all such cases mentioned by the Mansion House Council as shall be reported by the Sanitary Inspector to the Medical Officer of Health to require attention ; and that the Sanitary Inspector report to the Vestry in all cases where notices have been served and not attended to ; also that the Sanitary Inspector take immediate steps to require proper water supply to be furnished to the water closets. The following is a copy of the Bye-Laws made by the Vestry under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for this Parish, and allowed by the Local Government Board the 17th day of August, 1893:— BYELAWS.

Offices to be vacated October, 1893.—Mr. John Bulmer, Mr. John Eeeson, Rev. E. Josselyn Beck. 2nd Class. Offices to be vacated October, 1894.—Mr. E. Rumney Smith, Mr. H. L. Bartlett, Mr. R. L.

Brownfield, and that the Offices to be vacated in October next were to be filled up by an equal number of new Commissioners by the Vestry from among the voters in the Parish, but a person on ceasing to be a Commissioner was, unless disqualified, re-eligible. 39 The following is a copy of the audited financial Statement of the Commissioners to 25th March, 1893:— PARISH OF ROTHERHITHE.

Wells, builder, proposing to build upon the site of the old Drill Hall, Lower Road, a lodging house capable of accommodating 200 persons. A Committee of the Vestry having viewed the site and conferred with Mr. Jacob and Mr. Stock, his Architect, and having inspected a plan of the elevation thereof, were of opinion that the erection of a lodging-house as proposed on the said site would be objectionable on the ground that it would be likely to cause a nuisance and deteriorate the property in the locality, and they accordingly directed the Clerk to communicate with Mr. and Mrs. CarrGomm, the freeholders of the site, with a view to their taking steps to prevent the erection of the proposed building. The Committee subsequently met Mr. Carr-Gomm, Mr. Still, (his Solicitor,) Mr. Jacob, and Mr. Page the Architect, on the site, and discussed the matter with them, the result being that Mr. Carr-Gomm promised to consider the matter with Mrs. CarrGomm, and to further communicate with the Vestry. A letter was received from Mr. Carr-Gomm, the substance of which is as follows :— That he had fully explained the matter to Mrs. Carr-Gomm and considered it with her, and that as the land was not in their hands but in those of the lessee for the next 70 years, the only right they had was to approve or not of the building proposed to be erected: that the professional men he had consulted told him they could not see that the proposed building would in any way be detrimental to the place as the Vestry feared, and that there were no sufficient reasons on which they could legally withhold sanction ; but they did not desire to run counter to the wishes of the Vestry, and he suggested two alternative remedies, viz.:—If any of the objectors could bring forward at once, some one, either private individual, corporate body or religious community, who would come forward and offer to take the land and erect houses, shops, or unobjectionable buildings on the site, taking a sub-lease of not less than £35 from the lessee, Mr. and Mrs. Carr-Gomm would then not sanction Mr. Jacob's building, would personally undertake to satisfy him, and would use their influence to obtain the lessee's agreement to the change ; but if such scheme were not forthcoming, then he thought a great part of the objections might be met by allowing Mr. Jacob's building to go forward, insisting upon his making the entrance to the lodging house at least 50 feet up Neptune Street, and having on the Lower Road face only the entrance to the two shops. 41 The same having been read to the Committee, and Mr. Bulmer having suggested that the present would be a favourable opportunity to secure the ground for the purposes of the Vestry as it was probable that the Board Room in which they now met might not always be available for them, and as the site in question was in a very good position, the Vestry would do well to consider the matter with the view of erecting a Vestry Hall and Offices, at some future time, it was Resolved—To refer the further consideration of the matter to a Special Meeting of the Vestry, and to postpone giving a definite answer to Mr. Jacob until after such Special Meeting had been held. The Meeting was called for the 9th May, at which it was Resolved—To take up the lease at a ground rent of £35 per annum; the Clerk was also instructed to enquire of the freeholders whether they would sell the freehold, and if so upon what terms. A letter was subsequently received from the solicitors of the freeholders stating they were arranging with the various persons interested in the land in question for the purchase of their interest, and as soon as that was completed they would be prepared to carry out the arrangements by which the Vestry would take the lease at £35 a year, or if it was preferred, Mrs. Carr-Gomm would sell the freehold on the basis of the £35 a year rental. On 13th July, 1892, a further letter was received from the solicitors, stating that they had now settled with all the persons interested in the land and were therefore in a position to treat with the Vestry either for the sale of the freehold or for a building lease, that the freeholder had paid rather more than £250 to acquire the interest of the lessee, and on payment to them of £250 they would lease the land to the Vestry on a building lease for £25 a year ground rent or sell the freehold at a price to be calculated on the basis of a £25 a year ground rent: this letter was referred to the General Purposes Committee for consideration and report. The Committee met on the 27th July and directed the Clerk to enquire the lowest price the freeholders would dispose of the land for. £900 in addition to the £250 already mentioned was ascertained to be the price required, the Vestry paying the Vendors' costs in the matter, but after some further correspondence the freeholders ultimately agreed to sell the land for £900 in addition to £180 instead of £250 incurred by them in acquiring the interests of the lessees. This the Vestry accepted, and it was 42 Resolved—That the Clerk take the necessary steps to secure the purchase, and that the London County Council be asked to advance the money for the purpose. The loan had not been completed at the close of the year. At a General Meeting of the Vestry held 15th November, 1893, the Special General Purposes Committee reported that they had considered the memorial from the National Municipal and Vestry Employes Labour Union with rates of wages of the various workmen agreed upon at the Bermondsey Conference and conditions with respect to same, also advocating that all work be done without the aid of a contractor ; it was Resolved upon the recommendation of the Committee that the Vestry, as a principle, do their own work, and when practicable employ their own labour. The Mortuary accommodation in the parish was still under the consideration of the Vestry at the close of the year. The following is a list of the 25 public rights of wav to the river in this Parish:— Opposite West Lane. Platform Stairs. King's Stairs. Prince's Stairs. Elephant Stairs Church Stairs. Spread Eagle Stairs. Timothy's Wharf, east and west sides. Hanover Stairs. Surrey Dock Stairs. King and Queen Stairs. King and Queen Wharf. Globe Stairs. Horseferry Stairs. Pageants Stairs. Horns Stairs. Nelson Dock. Dantzic Wharf. White Horse Stairs. Laystall, Acorn Wharf. Commercial Dock Pier. Randalls Rents, and Dog and Duck Stairs. Subsidences occurred in the carriageway opposite Messrs. Brandam's Wharf, Rotherhithe Street, and in the footways of Corbett's Lane and Neptune Street, which were made good and no accidents were occasioned thereby; the two latter were stated by the Surveyor of Pavements to be occasioned by rats. Twenty dead trees were reinstated during the year. It was also Resolved—That trees be provided and planted on the footway in Rotherhithe New Road, from the "Halfway House" to the South Eastern Railway Company's Bridge, Bricklayers Arms Branch. 43 Staff. At a meeting of the Vestry held on the 7th February, 1893, the Clerk reported the d cease on the 25th January, of Mr. John Thomas Cooper, the Assistant Clerk of the Vestry. Upon the motion of Mr. Stuart, an unanimous Resolution was passed, conveying the Vestry's deep sympathy and condolence to his widow. Mr. Cooper had been in the service of the Vestry for but two years, having been appointed Assistant Clerk on the 24th March, 1891. The Vestry having caused advertisements to be issued for the appointment of an Assistant Clerk in the place of the late Mr. Cooper, a number of applications were received and considered; and ultimately Mr. James Day, the Junior Assistant Clerk, was appointed. Mr. Reuben J. Walker was afterwards promoted to the position made vacant by Mr. Day's appointment. ' 45 APPENDIX No. X.

Zymotic Diseases. The number of deaths in the Parish and the Asylums Board Hospitals is 132. Last year it was as low as 70.
