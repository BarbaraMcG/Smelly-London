Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields, for the Year 1873. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my fourth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Births. The Births during the year 1873 were 532; that is 36 more than in the previous year. 1873. Males 272 532 Females 260 1872. Males 256 496 Females 240 Deaths. The Deaths in the year 1873 amounted to 545; that is 41 in excess of the previous year. The following is c 18 an account of the deaths for 1873 and 1872, and also the annual death-rate per 1,000 of the estimated population:— 1873. Males 294 Deaths Females 251 545 Death-rate per 1,000, 25.7 1872. Males 295 Deaths Females 209 504 Death-rate per 1,000, 23.8 By this table it will be seen that in the year 1873 the mortality was higher than in the year 1872. This increased mortality was not due to disease of a pre- ventible nature, but to the great increase of Bronchitis and Asthma. In the year 1872 the deaths from Bron- chitisand Asthma were 40; in 1873 they numbered 80, just double. Of the 545 deaths in the year 1873, 150 occurred in the Charing Crcss Hospital; of the 150 persons who died in the Hospital, 34 were resident in the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, the remaining 116 were from other parts of London and the country. This circumstance will therefore reduce the death-rate of the Parish in the following manner:— Deaths, 1873 545 Deduct non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 116 429 19 The foregoing figures make the actual death-rate per 1,000 of the estimated population of the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the year 1873, 20.2. This is an increase of 1.5 per 1,000 over the previous year, 1872, due to the high mortality of Bronchitis and Asthma already mentioned. In the year 1872 the death-rate, after deducting the non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital, was 18.7. Ages at Death. The deaths during infancy still continue high, from causes mentioned in my Report of 1872. Of the 545 deaths, 160 occurred in children under five years of age, 38 between the ages of 5 and 20 years, 118 between 20 and 40 years, 141 between 40 and 60 years, 78 between 60 and 80 years, and 10 above 80 years. A female living in Charles Buildings died at the age of 97, another one residing in Martlett's Court, 92, and a third at Charing Cross, 94. Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—This class of complaints includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Croup, Whooping Cough, Typhus Fever, Typhoid Fever, Simple Continued Fever, Remittent Fever, Diarrhoea, and Cholera. The mortality from these complaints was 53. This is a diminution of 3 over the previous year, 1872, and 33 less than in the year 1871. c 2 20 Smallpox.—No death occurred from this complaint. Measles.—There were 11 deaths from this disease. This is the highest number since the year 1869. During the year 1873, Measles were very prevalent and fatal in the Metropolis. Scarlet Fever.—Only two deaths were due to this disease. Diphtheria.—Two deaths occurred from this malady. •/ Whooping Cough.—Whooping Cough was fatal to 15, that is 3 more than in the previous year. Fever.—This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever, and Remittent Fever. 11 deaths were registered from this class of disease. Diarrhcea.—This disease was fatal to 12, all in children under 5 years of age. The previous year the deaths from this complaint were 23. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs.—Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, including consumption, destroyed 196. This number exceeds the previous year by 43. Disease of Heart.—Disease of Heart produced 51 deaths; that is 26 more than the previous year. Cancer.—Cancer was fatal to 14 persons. 21 Inquests. The deaths from other causes will be found fully detailed in the Tables at the end of my Report. In the year 1873, there were held 73 inquests. Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— Natural causes 30 Drowning 3 Injuries received from falling down stairs 3 Cause not ascertained 6 Burns and Scalds 6 Falls from Houses 4 Suffocation 1 Run over or knocked down in the street 1 Injuries received from falls in the street 11 Hanging 1 Inflammation of brain, caused by a locust bean put into the ear of a little boy by himself 1 Inflammation of brain, from injury to eye, caused accidentally by a piece of tin thrown by a boy in the street 1 Injuries received from the falling of a brick wall 1 Carried forward 69 22 Inquests—continued. Brought forward 69 Injury to head from falling accidentally over the wall adjoining the steps of the National Gallery 1 Injury to head, caused by a brass lamp stand, which fell accidentally from a connecting bridge in Taylor's-buildings 1 Poisoning by oxalic acid 1 Intemperance 1 73 Bakehouses. The Act for the Regulation of Bakehouses, 1863. says: "1. That no person under the age of eighteen years shall be employed in any bakehouse between the hours of 9 of the clock at night and 5 of the clock in morning. 2. The inside walls and ceiling or top of every bakehouse, and the passages and staircase leading thereto, shall be limewashed or painted from time to time. 3. Every bakehouse shall be kept in a cleanly state, and shall be provided with proper means for effectual ventilation, and be free from effluvia from any drain, privy, or other nuisance. 4. No place on the same level with the bakehouse shall be used as a sleeping place, unless it is constructed as follows:—it is 23 effectually to be separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and to have an external glazed window of at least 9 superficial feet in area, of which at the least 4½ superficial feet are made to open for ventilation." On visiting the several Bakehouses in the Parish, I found them as a rule cleanly and well conducted. In no case could I ascertain that any person under 18 years of age was employed during the restricted hours. There was only one instance in which the men slept on a level with the Bakehouse, and in this case the requirements of the Act were complied with. The ventilation in many of the Bakehouses might be better, but the fact of their being situated under ground makes it exceedingly difficult to remedy this defect. In one case I had to order the removal of a privy which was in a most improper position in the Bakehouse. Slaughterhouses. In the Parish there are four licensed Slaughterhouses. From time to time I have examined them, and always found them cleanly and in good order. Oil no occasion have I received any complaint from people living in the vicinity of these Slaughterhouses. Sanitary Work. In the year 1873, 118 notices were served upon owners or occupiers of property to remedy sanitary 24 defects. As a rule, the notices were readily complied with, hut in some cases a great deal of trouble was given to get the works finished. In four instances summonses had to be taken out. In houses occupied by the lowest class of poor not much encouragement is given to landlords to make their dwellings comfortable. After they are put into repair the most wanton and wilful mischief is practised, closets stopped up with old boots, bricks, beer cans, or anything they can lay their hand3 upon; covers of dust-bins wrenched off for firewood, and even doors taken away; taps of the water supply stolen and also the lead pipes. The closets in many instances are used in a most disgusting manner, the seat and floor covered with excrement and filth. Underground Dwellings.—21 notices were served upon owners of houses to cause dwellings of this class not meeting the requirements of the Act to be vacated. Some of these dwellings are inhabited by only two or rhree persons, are kept clean, and free from dampness, vet the area may not be the required width, or the opening at the top of the area not sufficiently large to meet the requirements of the Act. No doubt all dwellings partially under ground, if even meeting the requirements of the Act, are not conducive to health, light and air must of course be more difficult of access. This class of rooms are let cheaper than others, hence the poorest are too glad to secure them. 25 The passages of the Courts leading out of Bedfordbury were all limewashed in the spring. The pipe sewers during the summer months have been regularly flushed, and the gullies in the streets also flushed with carbolic acid and water. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J, SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 26 Summary of Sanitary Work performed during the Year 1873.
