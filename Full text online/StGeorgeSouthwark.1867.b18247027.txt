ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE VESTRY. PREFATORY NOTE. This Report commences the account of the "Vestry's second decade. The Duties which it seems to have become a habit of the Legislature to accumulate on the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis continue to be augmented. This, while it goes far to shew that these bodies are not inefficient as sometimes is asserted, tends necessarily to increase their expenditure, and thereby the financial burdens also which their constituencies have to sustain. So long however as the objects of this expense are such as the improvement of the sanitary condition of the people, the greater safety and comfort of their dwellings and other cognate and indisputable benefits the necessary cost will not by the intelligent portion of the community be deplored. The Medical Officer of Health's Report, which commences on page It, affords at once a view of the sanitary condition of the Parish, and of those operations of the Vestry for improving it which come within the province of medical science. For the purpose of carrying into execution the Act of last Session, entitled "The Sanitary Act, 1866," the Vestry have appointed an enlarged Sanitary Committee; and to this committee have referred the obtaining of a plan and estimate for the erection of a Mortuary, and such other buildings as will be necessary for carrying out the 23rd, 24th, 27th, and 28th sections of that Act. It will also devolve on this committee to prepare and propose for adoption by the Vestry, and confirmation by one of Her Majesty's Secretaries of State, Regulations to relate to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, pursuant to the provisions of the 35 th section. Their attention will also particularly be given to the application of the provisions of the 25th, 38th, 39th, and 45th sections, which relate to the prevention of Infection and Contagion, and the disinfecting of infected places; and of those of the 53rd section which provides for the periodical removal of manure and other offensive refuse. The cost of scavenging has of late years greatly increased, partly on account of the growing difficulty of getting rid of the refuse. With a view to diminish this cost, and also the expense of keeping up of the metalled roads where the traffic is great, the Vestry are taking measures for paving the carriage-way of the Old Kent Road and the London Road by means of a loan, the repayment of which by instalments will extend over twenty years. The effect of this, it is hoped, will be to diminish both of the items of expense last mentioned, and also to improve these important thoroughfares. The present Contractor for scavenging and watering the roads has already agreed to make, so soon as the pitching of the Old Kent Road is completed, a deduction after the rate of £250 per annum from the amount payable to him. A copy of this Report will be supplied to any parishioner on application. DANIEL BIRT, Vestry Clerk. vestry Hall, Borough Road. 4 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southward.

ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO THE VESTRY by the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1867. Ma. Chairman and Gentlemen, With the last day of 1866, there closed a year full of domestic calamities. Earliest and most important of them all came the rinderpest, carrying loss and gloom into many a flourishing homestead: and increasing the price of two of the necessaries of life, viz., [milk and animal food. With the crowded stall and the lowing of kine was connected the health of the people. Those who had only small and fixed incomes, and those who were poorer still, had to exercise yet a moro rigid economy. Then followed the Cholera, an expected though unwelcome and dreaded visitor. So far, however, our fears have not been realised; its ravages having been confined within certain and narrow limits. A scanty harvest filled up the measure to the full. Passing into the year 1867, who could have dared to predict what grave consequences would have issued from the longer continuance of the intense cold with which it commenced? Statistics uniformly show, that not only are crimes more prevalent in times of scarcity and dearness, but that they are also of a far more serious and aggravated kind. I have not mentioned the financial panics, nor the political commotions, which have characterised the past year, and which have not rolled over us innocuously. % one, or other, or all of these, has the health of this district been affected. We have now entered a fresh decenniad: the works and labours of the past ton years He behind, and have become history. It is solemn to stand as we now do, upon the threshold of another decade of time, and reflect how much the health and happiness of this larish will depend upon what is done within these walls. It is well you should magnify your office, for it is one of immense importance to society, and it is one also attended with 12 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. great difficulties. We possess, however, a higher vantage ground than formerly ; the experience of the past has rendered plainer to us, and made more easy, the duties of the future. Sanitary administration needs no exordium; it aims to embrace all, and to do good unto all. Nay, is it not like unto Christianity? Does it not first give itself to the poor, desiring to deliver them from out of the depths of their moral and physical degradation.? I have felt much surprise at the apathy and neglect shewn by the Clergy in general to Sanitary Reform.* The minister of religion enjoys immense power, both from his education and his position, and by the opportunity afforded him of regularly addressing large numbers of people; hence, to his spiritual teachings might be added with consistency the teaching of care for the body. Body and soul have one Maker; break the laws by which they are governed, sin is engendered, and punishment certain. This subject has not escaped attention; and as I think it one of great importance with reference to the speedier advance and practice of sanitary science, I will quote two writers who have expressed very clear opinions upon it. Dr. Druitt, Chairman of the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health, purposely made a visit to a town in France, in which the Cholera was especially fatal. As one result of that visit he makes the following remarks:—"What strikes us as strange is, that these reverend personages never seem to think that they have any thing to do with the physical or material topics, just as if that were an altogether different department, presided over by a different divinity from Him who rules the soul and the spiritual world. Surely the man who prays fervently to God and the saints to preserve him from cholera, might be told to take a besom and a pail of whitewash and cleanse his cottage as an acceptable work. But it is the same with the Clergy here. Whether it be the cattle plague or the cholera, they preach against vice in the abstract, and leave unnoticed the most crying sins against the laws of creation, as if they belonged to another department. Would to Heaven that they would add to the seven corporal acts of mercy that of cleansing the filthy." And A. K. H. B., the essayist, and a Clergyman of the Episcopal Church of Scotland thus writes:—"I suppose it is now coming to be acknowledged by all men of sense, that it is a christian duty to care for our |ellow creatures' bodies as well as their souls; that it is hateful cant and hypocrisy to pray for the removal of disease which God by the revelation of nature has taught us may be averted by the use of physical means, while those means have not been faithfully employed." During the year ending 30th March, 1867, the births of 2044 living children were registered. The number of births is less by 145 than in the year 1865-6. The deaths registered amounted to 1502. This number exceeds by 20 that of the year 1865-6. The excess of births over deaths is 542. The annual death rate is 27 in 1000 persons living. There are some districts in England in which the death rate is only 17 in 1000 persons living, consequently 555 have died, who would not have died had this district been as healthy. From an analysis of an English life-table made by Mr. Rumsey, we find that tho probabilities of the duration of life at every age have decreased between 1841 and 1854, and that * Of course there are many and very noble examples of distinguished Clergymen taking great interest m sanitary improvements, but it is to be lamented that this is so partial. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1866—7. 13 this decrease is greatest just when life and health ought to be most certain and vigorous; that is, at the ages from 20 to 50. The table which shall extend the calculation to 1864 is not yet published; when that table is published we hope a more favourable disclosure will be made; otherwise doubts of the good of sanitary science will find a more specious pretext. It is only during the period of time, between the years 1854 and 1864 that sanitary measures have been extensively and continuously carried on, consequently we cannot expect that they should as yet have had much power to influence the mortality. As evil results do not cease immediately their cause is removed; so, neither, do good results follow immediately their cause is set in operation. TABLE No. 1. Week. Kent Road. Borough Road.

The diseases of this destructive class were fatal to 329 persons ; 18 more than in the year 1865-6. This appears somewhat disheartening; but the increase is not due to the inefficacy of sanitary measures, but in the main to wilful ignorance, apathy, and prejudice. Smallpox has killed 44 persons in this district, and has maimed and injured far more. On the 14th day of May, 1796, vaccination was first performed in England; and yet in the year 1866-7 in a population of 55, 510 there are 44 deaths recorded from this foulest of diseases. It is shewn in a report of the Small-pox Hospital, that we have been suffering from an epidemic of this disease, which for duration and universality has gone beyond any epidemic "within the memory of the present generation." If facts are of any value, and if statistics be allowed as proof, then the benefit which vaccination confers cannot be gainsaid. Dr. Marson tells us, after an experience derived from thirty years of labour at the Small Pox Hospital, during which period over 15,000 cases have passed under his notice, that while the unvaccinated have died at the rate of 37 per cent., the vaccinated have died at the rate only of 6½ per cent. He tells us more than this: he states from tables most carefully drawn, that the degree of modifying power is in the exact ratio of the excellence and completeness of the vaccination, as shewn by the marks. The unvaccinated, as I have stated, die at the rate of 37 per cent., whilst those imperfectly vaccinated [have a mortality of nearly 9 per cent.: the thoroughly vaccinated die at about ½ per cent. To say that you have been vaccinated will not suffice to ensure your safety; for then comes the question, How was the operation performed ? If imperfectly, you are but one step from the 16 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. tion you would have been in had you never been vaccinated. "The protective power of vaccination," writes Dr. Seaton, "against small-pox, extends to every race of mankind, and is seen in every climate, and in every part of the habitable globe. Wherever small-pox has been known to occur, exemption from the attack has been the rule among the vaccinated, the exception among the unvaccinated." In society there is always found a body of men so perverse, that they will deny all that others believe, and believe all that others deny. The benefits of vaccination could not escape challenge; hence we have it denounced by them in these latter days, almost as virulently as in the former days, when its results were unknown. Amongst them there are doubtless some who refuse belief in the benefit of vaccination from honest motives; and to which motives has lately been added the fear of a special poison being passed into the blood with the vaccine matter. I have seen no trustworthy evidence upon which to base any real ground of fear. Measles was fatal to 25, in place of 34 of the previous year. Scarlatina and hooping cough have proved more fatal, giving an excess of 6 and 7 deaths duriug that time. Typhus was fatal in 41 instances; in 1865-6 there were 51 deaths from this disease. It appears from a report made by Dr. Murchison, that two facts have been made clear upon a subject which heretofore has afforded considerable discussion. The first of these facts is, that the concentration of the fever poison, by placing those suffering from it together, does not increase the mortality amongst the patients: and the second fact is, that the concentration of the fever poison does not increase the danger of the attendants. In the first half of the year 1862 the records of the Fever Hospital gave the mortality as nearly 21 per cent; whilst at that time in six of the General Hospitals it was 23.32. In the Fever Hospital one person took the fever for every 40 admitted; and one died for every 135 admitted. In the General Hospitals one person took the fever for nearly every 4 admitted; and one died for every 129 admitted. In the year 1866 the mortality in the Fever Hospital had decreased to 19½ per cent., and one only took the fever for every 56 admitted. Whether an equal decline has taken place in the General Hospitals, I have no means of informing you. Granting these statements correct, and there is no reason to doubt them, then the necessity and benefit of Fever Hospitals are shewn, and the power given to Vestries to build them is one that should be exercised. In every district in London there are certain localities that are never free from fever. These localities I need not say, have the stamp of poverty deeply and legibly engraven upon them. But every now and then, from some change in the susceptibility of the person, or from some peculiarity of season, it crosses the limit of its narrow circle and rages far and wide. From such an outburst we have recently emerged, and we are now enjoying a singular immunity from its attacks. From the various London districts there have been sent to the Hospitals 1,718 cases of fever during the last half of the year 1866. The admissions from some of the districts were 51, 53, 62, 73, 76, 87, 108, 117, 139, and 144. From this district 26 were sent. Now how manifestly unjust it would be to take a district whilst labouring and staggering under the attack of a fever epidemic, and represent this occasional condition as its normal one; and then contrast it with others free from fever epidemic, and attribute the difference to sanitary neglect. The causes of fever are deeply seated in our social state. Not only without the man must its sources be sought, but with"1 the man. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1866—7. 17 I must now call your attention to the epidemic which visited us last year, but from which happily our district suffered so little. Cholera, whatever may be its cause, has lost none of its old malignancy. We had flattered ourselves that such was not the case, and reasonably so, for with each attack its mortality had decreased. In the three epidemics which have visited London, the deaths to every 10,000 of the population were 62, 43, and 18. In the East Districts, however, during the recent epidemic the deaths were 64 to every 10,000. Its apparent decline in this and other districts may, I think, without assumption, be attributed as due to sanitary improvements. The origin of cholera, though still very obscure, has had some light thrown upon it by the late outbreak, and by that of the cattle plague. Cholera is a morbid poison that enters into the blood either by the way of the stomach or lungs, and pollutes it. It is probably a living organism, consisting of "germinal matter, or living cells, possessing individuality, which are capable of preserving their activity for a certain time outside the living organism, of adhering to material objects, and of being carried from one place to another by currents of air " and by water. " By living cells is not meant living, in the sense in which an animal, or even a low form of infusoria I lives; but living as a seed, or-as vaccine matter, even when dried, may be living, inasmuch as it still possesses reproductive vitality." When once this poison is active and prevalent, season and temperature seem to exercise little influence over it. Neither climate nor season," says a modem writer, "nor earth nor ocean has power to arrest its course, or alter its features. It was equally destructive at St. Petersburg and Moscow as in India; as fierce and incurable amongst the snows of Russia, as in the sun-burnt regions of India; as destructive in the vapoury districts of Burmah as in the parched provinces of Hindostan." Observation has, however, favoured the conclusion that heat, moisture, and a complete stagnation of the air are most conducive to its spread. Mists, from their nature, afford a most favourable medium for carrying about in solution, or otherwise, the emanations that are exhaled from the earth, as well as whatever organisms may be present. Hence probably the origin of the blue mist, about which we have heard so much. Cholera has prevailed most in low lying districts, owing chiefly to the stagnancy of the air, and to the necessary concentration of foul emanations. Currents of air may be rushing along high over-head, whilst all below is calm and unruffled. Besides, the poison germ itself may be heavier than the air like that of malaria, and so fall down and settle. That these germs are invisible need occasion no surprise, for what a multitude of floating particles of matter will a sun-beam reveal, which before were unseen. The distance to which they may travel we cannot measure, inasmuch as such a heavy material as sand can be borne along hundreds of miles, according to a statement made by Dr. Mc Leod in his Eastern Travels. " Whilst sailing along," he says, "parallel to the coast of Africa, and having been long out of sight of land, the weather rigging of the ship was all brown with sand which had adhered to the tar; and this was only visible on the side of the ropes next the desert." In Nova Scotia, Canada, and in other countries where pine forests of any considerable extent are met with, there is an annual fall of pollen. When the trees are in full bloom, the pollen fills the air, and only becomes visible by its coating the surface of the lakes and ponds, and quiet bays of the sea; it finds its way down the water spouts into cisterns and tanks. Now it is very reasonable to suppose that in a similar manner the cholera poison may float about, falling here and there, in larger or smaller quantities, as currents of air or other circumstances may direct, although at no time becoming visible. There can be no doubt but that it is 18 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southward. spread by other means than that of water. But to the late Dr. Snow is great credit to be given for shewing to what extent cholera is transmitted by that vehicle. Drs. Orton and Comer, from their expensive experience in the east districts during the late epidemic, believe that its spread and mortality were owing more to sanitary defects than to any other cause. We may imagine the germs of the poison to be present, but the conditions necessary to their developement absent. Granting however their presence, and all the circumstances favourable to their developement, then there is required a subject into which they may enter, and work out their deadly results. A man in the full tide of health, and with all the surroundings by which such a state is maintained, would cast off easily and harmlessly the poison from him. But let a man suffer from the want of the com'mon necessaries of life; let his body and mind be habitually overtaxed ; let him be a constant prey to anxiety and fear; let his dwelling place be unhealthily situated and overcrowded; let him be the inheritor of a vitiated constitution ; or labour under some form of chronic disease; and we may well conceive how readily he would fall a victim to the disease. The manner in which this Vestry exercised its powers, to place the Parish in the fittest condition to resist the threatened epidemic, was all that could be desired. I may be permitted to recapitulate in a few words the measures that were taken, in order that the Ratepayers may have reason for confidence; and may be satisfied that the interests committed to the members of this Vestry, have been most carefully and anxiously considered. A Sanitary Committee was appointed, furnished with full powers to carry out at once whatever operations might be deemed necessary. This Committee held frequent and stated meetings, and occasional meetings, whenever circumstances occurred that demanded them. Daily meetings were held by the Chairman of that Committee, the Vestry Clerk, and myself. Three qualified medical men were chosen, whose whole time was devoted to house-to-house visitation, and to affording prompt remedial assistance in cases of persons attacked with diarrhoea or cholera. They had to report daily of all they saw and did. A Dispensary was opened in this building on Saturday the 4th August, and was closed on Saturday 6th October. During this period 5,154 persons were supplied gratuitously with medicine, and 2,791 with disinfectants. There were given away 182 gallons of medicine, nearly 2 tons of chloride of lime, and 2,400 gallons of disinfecting fluid. Three Dispensers were appointed to carry out this work; one being present day and night. The first case of cholera happened in the Borough-road, to a male infant; the last to a middle-aged woman in Red Cross-court. Of the 38 deaths, 16 were under 5 years of age, and 15 were 20 years of age and upwards. The following Table shews the number of deaths that occurred in each week from cholera, and also from diarrhoea. TABLE No. 5. July 7. July 14. July 21. July 28. August 4. August 11. August 18.

Consumption is more destructive than any other disease, and has proved fatal in 211 cases. The next disease in rate of mortality is bronchitis; 165 persons have died from this disease. From inflammation of the lungs the mortality has been 110. Over these diseases the weather exercises a very powerful influence. The following is an account of those who perished from violence, either by accident, suicide, or homicide. Two male infants, and six female infants were suffocated in bed. Their ages ranged from four days to eight months. Six persons died from injury to the skull and brain, either from being run over, or from falling down stairs. A male infant, aged 9 months was suffocated whilst drinking milk from a bottle. A female infant was drowned by falling into a pail of water. A male, aged 9 years, and a female, aged 6 years, were burnt to death; one from the clothes taking fire, the other from the house being burned down. A male, aged 71 years, ruptured a blood vessel from a fall. A female, aged 49 years, ruptured her liver from the same cause. A male, 36 years of age, and a female, 52 years of age, hung themselves. A male, aged 41 years, leapt from the roof of a house into the street. A female, aged 28 years, was murdered by having her throat cut; and another, 40 years of age, by having her skull broken with a stone. Thirty-seven persons whose deaths are registered, were 80 years of age and upwards; 3 were 90 years of age and upwards. The utmost limit reached was 94; and he who passed through that lengthened period of time was an inmate of the workhouse. Much has been done during the past year to diminish the offensiveness of the trades carried on in Green-street. Great improvements have been made both in the interior of the buildings, and in the mode of conducting the works. The emanations proceeding from them have been much diminished, as well as their offensiveness abated. It was formerly ruled that usefulness should compensate for noisomeness; and that unless it could be proved deleterious to health, a manufacture however disagreeable might be introduced into a town." Is there not a probability that we are hastening to the other extreme, and that we are becoming too nice about those things that offend the senses? Great cleanliness, order, and 20 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. comfort may and would exist in the absence of trade ; but unfortunately there would be the absence also of many other things, which would not prove so agreeable. Amid the din the bustle, the dust, the confusion and smoke of traffick, we cannot expect that our sense of smell shall escape offence, our hands remain unsoiled, our ears be not deafened by discordant noises. It is upon commerce that the glory and prosperity of this country has been built, and its lofty superstructure stands safe thereon. But hamper our industrial enterprise and energy, as some of the Bills before Parliament propose to do, and the price we shall be called upon to pay for our refined delicacy will be far too costly. There are certain trades which from their nature, such as those where chemical processes are carried on, or where the storage of combustible and explosive materials are necessary, should at once be sent to a distance. In these cases not only the convenience but the health and lives of the surrounding population are at stake. All possible means of lessening offenco from trades should be rigidly enforced, but I doubt the propriety of either stopping them or sending them away.

An Act was passed in the last session of 1866, one of the sections of which require that the Conservators of the Thames should cause its surface, as far as possible to be scavenged, in order that substances liable to putrefaction might be removed therefrom. Another section also provides that no sewer shall open into the Thames. A very necessary requirement, inasmuch as water polluted with cholera and fever discharges is believed to be the most certain means of conveying their poisons. But assuming this not so, there exists no reason why we should drink water fouled with cholera and fever discharges. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1866—7. 21 TABLE No. 8.

This Table requires no comment: it significantly tells its own tale. The poorest and worst parts of the Parish have experienced the greatest mortality. The index steadily points to disease and death. It is discouraging to see what a vast amount of energy runs to waste and what large sums of money are uselessly spent, when the right use of both are so urgently demanded, and the labour required in employing them not more difficult in the one case than the other. The dwellings in which poverty and wretchedness find shelter have been truly described as " detrimental to health and life, degrading to the moral and physical constitution, producing a disastrous amount of intemperance and immorality, successfully opposing the progress of education and the influence of religious teaching, disgusting all who are not inured to an atmosphere of impurity ; promoting and intensifying attacks of epidemic disease, and deeply injurious to the welfare of society at large." We, after all that has been said, hardly recognise how demoralising these foul dwellings are. A late police magistrate said, that if empty casks were placed along the streets of Whitechapel, that each of them in a few days would have a tenant, and that these tenants would keep up their kind, and prey upon the community. Allow these tub-men no education, and in the midst of civilization you would have a horde of savages." Without "tubs" we have nearly realized the rearing of "savages, in the midst of our civilization." How these unfit habitations are to be razed, and more suitable ones erected, is a problem which now demands solution. To adorn our towns and cities with monuments, temples, and obelisks will avail little whilst the dwellings of the poor remain as at present. The poor have no choice ; they must take the houses as they are; and the space they can obtain, will be in proportion to the amount they can pay, not according to their requirements. Here lies the whole gist of the matter as regards overcrowding. No bill passed by Parliament; no society formed by the wealthy and charitable, will work out the least good, unless provisions are made for allowing sufficient cubic space, at a rent now paid for insufficient cubic space. If a man with a family can only Pay eighteen-pence, or two shillings, or three shillings he cannot possibly escape overcrowding. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1866—7. 23 How great this evil of overcrowding is, and how difficult to be avoided, may be inferred from the condition of our soldiers. Here we have picked men; drilled to their work ; compelled in all things to obey; diet and hours rigidly regulated; yet these men are daily perishing from overcrowding. Government, with all its powerful means and appliances, cannot afford them breathing spacc. What then can a Vestry do? There is a povertystricken and unruly population. Obedience cannot be enforced, and which indeed if it could no benefit would follow, as they have neither means nor power to provide what is necessary, as the Government possesses, to provide for the soldier, yet does not. To me it seems that it would be far wiser, and certainly have a far more practical and beneficial influence, that men who desire to perpetuate their name, or their friends who desire to do it for them, should select for that purpose the building of blocks of houses first, and afterwards, works of art. Daily then would men bless their benefactors' memory, as daily they would enjoy the fruits of the good work bequeathed. Many Model Lodging Houses have been built, but the rents are far above the means of those who most need them, such as the daily labourer, the costermonger, and the like. I visited some the other day, in which there were three flats in each house, and three rooms on each flat, with suitable conveniences; the rent for each flat was 7/6 per week. The property, it is said, pays 5 per cent. But what would be the use of such houses in St. George's New-town and similar localities? On going through one of the houses which was empty, and had only been occupied six months, I found it greatly damaged, and exceedingly dirty; yet the rent must have insured a superior class of the people. Amongst the lowest class there is not the slightest care taken of property; whatever admits of destruction is destroyed, even when their own convenience and comfort are at stake. Time and education can alone alter this. But as now situated this class cannot be educated, for everything about it is unfavourable. My wonder is, that the men and women whose birth and growth have been amidst such surroundings, are not worse, very far worse than we find them. The late Chaplain (Rev. Mr. Clay) of the Preston House of Correction, said concerning thieves, "that their habits from children had been such, that even if by God's blessing a new heart and a right spirit could be implanted within them, there would still often remain the difficulty of qualifying them to obtain a livelihood by their own honest exertions." Hordes of children are sent out to live as they can, with their little sharp premature faces, and eyes expressing a painful cunning; or they are sent out by parents too idle to work, or who are sunk in intemperance, to beg or steal, and their reception home will depend upon their gains; if little, blows and curses; if much, then perhaps a sullen recognition. What can these children become? What can they do? Just what we should do under the like circumstances, fit ourselves for the prison and the hulks, We stand aghast when we hear of the guilt and savage brutality of this class; our indignation knows no bound, and we design and prepare for them the cat, the gallows-rope, and other sore punishments. Are not these vices and crimes "but the foliage and fruit of such trees as we now see growing?" That which has been sown springs up, and not another thing. Is there no Company that can be formed which will not mind "cash payment," but will lay out its money freely without usury? It is my deliberate conviction that the large sums of money collected for building Churches, and which when built, are only remarkable for their emptiness, would be far more usefully spent in the physical welfare of the people. A mighty change must pass over the class of which I am now speaking before it will become a Church-going people. 24 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southward. "Great cities are great plagues;" and constantly are they increasing in size and population. They have been described as the splendid sepulchres which nations build unto themselves. Shall this saying remain for ever true? or shall your labours here form part of one vast endeavour whereby this terrible doom may be averted; and so this great city escape the fate of the cities of the past.
