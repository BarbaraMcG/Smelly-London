Board's Offices, Catford, S.E., June, 1883. REPORT to The Board of Works for the Lewisham District, TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1882, by F. EACHUS WILKINSON, M.D., &c., Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The population of the Lewisham District, estimated to the middle of the year 1882, amounted to 74,901, residing in 11,941 houses. Table I. gives the estimated population, the number of inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages which have taken place in the District during the year 1882 and the 10 previous years. Table 11, gives the annual rate of mortality, death rates amongst children, and death rates at the public institutions in the District for the same periods. Table 111. gives the deaths registered at several groups of ages from different causes during the year. Table IV. gives the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and the proportion to population, and to 1,000 deaths in 1882. Table V. gives the number of deaths in the 10 years, 1872 to 1881 inclusive, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, and the number in the year 1882. 2 Table VI. gives the Inspectors' Reports of the sanitary work completed during the year. Table VII. gives the number of inhabited houses, the estimated population in 1882, with the birth and death rate in the Registrar's Sub-districts in the Lewisham Parish, and the Hamlet of Penge, together comprising "the Lewisham District." Table VIII. gives the area, the census population in the years 1871 and 1881, the estimated population in 1882, and the mortality in various Metropolitan Districts, and in England and Wales, &c. Table IX. gives the population, the number of persons to an acre of ground, the number of births and deaths, the mean temperature and rainfall in London and 27 large towns of the United Kingdom, and in the Lewisham District. Table X. The number of children attending public elementary and certified efficient schools in the Parish of Lewisham and in the Hamlet of Penge during: the year 1882. Table XI. A Register of the licensed cow-houses in the District, together with a list of the milk sellers in the District who have no licenses. Table XII. A list of the licensed slaughter-houses in the District. Marriages. During the year 1882, 392 Marriages took place in the 1 arish oi Lewisham, of which 326 were solemnized in the several Church of England Churches, 31 in Dissenting Chapels, and 35 at the Registrar's Office. One hundred and nineteen Marriages took place in the 3 Hamlet of Penge, of which 98 were solemnized in Church of England Churches, 11 in Dissenting Chapels, and 7 at the Registrar's Office. Births. The Registered Births in the District in the year 1882 amounted to 2,280. Males 1,165. Females 1,121. The Birth Rate to population was 30.52 per 1,000. In London 133,200 births were registered, the annual Birth Rate being 34.3 per 1,000, being the lowest birth rate for 20 years, that is, since 1862, in which year the rate was 34.2. In England and Wales 888,940 were registered, the annual Birth Rate being 33.6 per 1,000. The natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths in the Lewisham district was 1194. Deaths. The number of Deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1882 was 1,092, being 1(3 in excess of the number registered during the previous year. The annual rate of mortality per 1,000 was 14.58. The annual rate of mortality of England and Wales in the year 1882 was 19.5. In the Metropolitan and City Police Districts 20.6. In Registration London, 21.4; and in the district outside Registration London, 17.4 per 1,000. By reference to Table III., which gives the mortality registered at several groups of ages, it will be seen that, of the 1,092 Deaths registered from all causes in 1882, 453 4 died under the age of 5 years, of which number 285 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 285 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 89 between the ages of 1 and 2 79 „ „ 2 „ 5 81 „ „ 5 „ 15 50 „ „ 15 „ 25 54 „ „ 25 „ 35 70 „ „ 35 „ 45 87 „ „ 45 „ 55 102 „ „ 55 „ 65 104 „ „ 65 „ 75 70 „ „ 75 „ 85 20 „ „ 85 „ 95 1 „ „ 95 and upwards. Of the diseases which produced the mortality at these ages— 154 took place from zymotic diseases. 173 „ „ constitutional diseases. 598 „ „ local diseases. 154 „ „ developmental diseases. 13 „ ,, violent deaths. Water Supply. With regard to Water supply, the important question for the Sanitary Authority is not only its sufficient quantity, and its proper filtration and purity, before distribution, but to see that the cisterns for storing water are placed in accessiblc situations, in order that they may be readily and frequently cleansed, and to see that no contamination takes place from any connection with the water closet, or between the overflow pipe of the cistern and the drain. The Board of Trade regu;ation 1879, re;ative to waste 5 pipes, provide that no overflow or waste pipe, other than a warning pipe, shall be attached to any cistern supplied with water by a company. Sewer Oases. Continued watchful care is required to prevent the ingress of foul air, the product of sewer putrefaction, permeating into dwellings. Houses are constantly found which communicate with drains by waste pipes, soil pipes constructed within the house, cesspools, drains, and, at times, overflow pipes, sink pipes, bath pipes, and lavatory basin pipes, and although supposed to be secured by traps, fail to keep out poisonous gases laden with the germs of infection. A great deal of trouble has been taken to get these dangers prevented in the construction of new houses in the district, but constant supervision is requisite. No soil pipe should be constructed within a house, and should always be ventilated, and no house should, by means of drains, in any way communicate with a sewer, but should have its connection broken between the house and drain traps and terminate by a free end into the open air outside the house. Cow Houses and Dairies. As milk often constitutes the sole diet of infants and invalids, it becomes of the most serious importance that this nutritious food should be of a pure quality. The surroundings of cow-houses and dairies should be kept scrupulously clean, and in the event of any case of sickness amongst the cows, the animal should be kept separate from others, and the milk from the diseased animal thrown away. 6 The attendance upon cows by those who have recently been the subject of epidemic diseases, should be forbidden. The water used for the washing of cans must also be of a pure description, and not drawn from a dirty cistern or well. The requirements for cow-houses are, that—There must be a cubic space of 800 feet for each cow ; the sides and flooring of the cow-house must be of Some solid and impervious material; there must be proper light and ventilation ; proper paving and drainage of the cow-house and adjoining yard ; a good water supply ; a properly constructed dung-pit; and a clean, covered, impervious receptacle for grains. The cowhouses must be cleansed, and the manure removed therefrom twice daily ; and all refuse removed from the premises at least three times a week before 7 a.m. The Board's Hospital. The Hospital for the reception of patients suffering from epidemic disease is now the freehold property of the Board of Works of the Lewisham District, and the new building is now completed. It is well situated, being in a locality far away from inhabited houses and at a good elevation, and has a Resident Nurse ready for the reception of patients. Ambulances are kept at Lewisham and Penge, for the conveyance of patients suffering from infectious disease. The importance of this establishment cannot be overestimated, for whenever a case of epidemic disease is removed in order to prevent its communication to others, it confers a benefit to the general public. On this ground the payment for the maintenance and mcdical attendance should be as low as possible to the friends of the patient. 7 In accordance with this view, by a Resolution of the Hoard, dated 23rd June, 1880, the payment was fixed at one guinea per week, such charge to include maintenance and medical attendance. The charge for the ambulance is only the actual cost incurred in each case for horse hire. Disinfection. One disinfecting apparatus, for the purpose of disinfecting the wearing apparel, bedding, &c , of those who have suffered from epidemic disease, is placed at Lewisham, and another at Penge. Covered iron carts arc in readiness to fetch and deliver apparel, &c Latrines. The establishment of. Latrines in the district has been under consideration. Baths. During the year the Vestry have appointed Commissioners for the purpose of erecting Public Baths in the Parish of Lewisham, and it is anticipated that great good will result to the inhabitants from the use of the Baths when erected. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E. WILKINSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the Lewisham District. 8 TABLE I.

Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting my Fourteenth Annual Report of work executed in my department during the past financial year. HIGHWAYS. The following Table will give the quantities of material used for the maintenance of the Public Roads in the District:— Division. Granite. Port Philip Stone. Dug Flints. Gravel. Total. Lewisham Parish, cubic yards 5327 308 2661 2155 10,451 Hamlet of Penge, ditto 613 ... 1377 645 2635 Total 5940 308 4038 2800 13,086 The rainfall from 26th March, 1882, to the 25th March, 1883, inclusive, as read at the rain guage at the Stone-yard, Forest Hill, was as follows:— 2 Number of days on which rain fell. inches dec. 3 1882 March 26th to 31st inclusive 0.51 9 April 2.19 6 May 0.84 13 June 2.04 17 July 2.10 13 August 0.87 10 September 2.41 20 October 5.44 14 November 1.84 14 December 1.60 21 1883 January 1.72 17 February 2.86 7 March to 25th inclusive 0.43 164 24.5 Rain fell upon 164 days, and 3 09 inches more rain fell this year than the corresponding period last year. The roads are in a fairly good state of repair. From the 1st of October to the end of February 13.66in. rain fill on 86 days. Frost, of short duration, occurred which tried the roads, and made the work of removing the slop very heavy. I do not recollect a worse winter. There were as many as 98 loads of slop removed in Lewisham Parish in one day. The number of carts employed were not sufficient to take away the mud as soon as desirable. I am glad to say the West Kent Main Sewer and the new Outfall Main Sewer to Deptford are now completed. Carrying out two large works like these brought a good deal of additional traffic upon the main road through Lewisham to Bromley Hill, and the wear and tear was proportionately greater. ROAD WATERING. The greater part of the work of watering the Blackheath and Lewisham Roads was done by the horses belonging to the Board, and men in their employ; Mr. Thos. Lane, of Rushey Green, supplied horses and men at a contract price of 9s. 0d. per day tor each horse, harness, and man, to do the remaining portion of the work. In Sydenham and Forest Hill, the work was done by Mr. Wm. Stimpson at a contract price of 8s. 9d. per horse, man, and harness; and in the Lower Sydenham Division, Messrs. W. and J. Woodham contracted for the work at 8s. 6d. per day per horse, man, and harness. The Roads in the Hamlet of Penge 3 were watered at a contract price of 8s. 3d. per day for each horse, man, and set of harness; Mr. Richard Winnifrith being the contractor. The Board in each case supplied the waggons and carts. The following will give the number of miles of Road watered during the season. Locality. Miles. Yards. Lewisham and Blarkheath 17 20 Sydenham and Forest Hill 19 940 Hamlet of Penge 10 1214 Total 47 414 The supply from the Kent Water Company was good, but the supply in the Lambeth Company's District was at times deficient and interfered with the work being as well done as it would have been had the supply been better. The Company have been laying additional mains, and it is expected the supply will be Better this year. The Greenwich Boundary Roads were watered by arrangement with us, the Greenwich Board of Works paying half the estimated cost, as also the Road of Sydenham Hill, the Camberwell Vestry paying half the cost. Another two-horse water van was purchased during the year, which proved very useful. This is the second two-horse van purchased by the Board. I find they save labour. STREET LIGHTING. At present there are in the Parish of Lewisham 664 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company and 619 lamps lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Company. In the Hamlet of Penge there are 353 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company. The present charges for lighting the Street Lamps are as follows:-The Crystal Palace Gas Company, £3 15s. 0d. per lamp per annum, and the South Metropolitan Gas Company, £3 17s. per lamp per annum. These charges include lighting, extinguishing, cleaning &c. The columns are paid for in addition, and are the property of the Board. During the year the Crystal Palace District Gas Company reduced the price 4s. 9d. per lamp per annum as follows:—1s. 7d. in June, 1s. 7d. in September, and 1s. 7d. in March. This Company now charges less than the South Metropolitan Gas 4 Company, who, by their position, ought to supply gas at a lower rate. It may be well for me to state that both Companies allow a discount for cash payment of their accounts. This discount amounted to £316 1s. 6d. during the year. The following will show the new lamps erected. Lewisham.

Three lamps, with improved burners and reflectors, were supplied by Mr. William Sugg, and erected at the entrance to the Yard, Forest Hill; near the subway, Forest Hill; and Blackheath Village. They appear to answer very well, but the expense will prevent their being generally adopted. An improved burner and lantern was also fixed at the lamp at Lewisham Bridge, and the old argand burner removed. The power of the burner was increased from 50 candles to 100 candles. COLLECTION OF DUST, &c. In the Parish of Lewisham the Dust and Ashes were collected by horses and carts belonging to the Board. The Parish was divided into four Districts, and the Dust disposed of by Contract as follows:- Lewisham Parish. No. or District or Locality. Contract Price per Load.

It may be well to say that the carts used in Penge are much smaller than those used in Lewisham. BOARD'S HORSES. During the year five old Horses were disposed of, as they were unfit for the Board's work. One horse died of consumption, and another had to be slaughtered. Seven new Horses were bought to replace these. There has been no epidemic or preventable disease in the stables during the year. The greater portion of the greenmeat used was purchased by the acre from the grower, and a saving of 25 per cent. was made; but I may not be able always to do this, as I bought at a very favourable price, and the saving depends in a great measure upon the distance the greenmeat purchased is from the stables. Versmann's Moss Litter was used as an experiment for bedding, and I found it to answer so well that nothing else is now used in the stable. The moss is about 30 per cent. cheaper than straw.

The diversion of the old main Sewer near Clune House, Sydenham Road, was executed under contract by Mr. Marshall of Brighton. The new Sewer is 3 feet by 2 feet egg-shaped half-a-brick ring in cement, and backed up with cement concrete. The diversion of the main Sewer in Maple Road, Penge, is the same size and of similar construction, and was executed under contract by Mr. Harris, of Camberwell. The relaying of the pipe Sewer in Westbourne Road and Perry Vale was also completed. The work was done by Mr. Goodair under contract. The new 6 feet outfall relief barrel Sewer from Deptford to Lee Bridge was completed by the Metropolitan Board of Works; and the members of the Lewisham Board, on their annual inspection, walked through a portion of it before sewage was admitted. I hope to see this Sewer extended towards Sydenham and Penge. There can be no doubt that the portion already constructed will be a great boon to the District. A Sewer has been arranged to be constructed through the Karl of Dartmouth's land, from Ademr.ore Gardens to Ladvwell. 1 am sorry the projected Sewer along the Southend Road to the Priory Estate, and then to Southend Village, appears to hang fire. The Metropolitan Board have refused to contribute towards the construction, either wholly or in part. 1 much regret this, as the Sewer is needed as a sanitary measure. There are overflows from cesspools, &c., which continually pollute the River Ravensbouine. It is a matter of congratulation that the Marlowe Road Sewer has been constructed by the Beckenham Authority, and that we have, to a great extent, got rid of the nuisance of the Boundary Ditch. The drainage at the Woodlands, &c., Hither Green Lane, is into cesspools, and there is, at present, no available Sewer. Certainly the two most urgent Sewers required at the present time are to drain the Woodlands, the Priory Estate, and Southend Village. I trust, before long, arrangements will be made to lay these Sewers. 13 I have prepared the Table below showing the numbers of Houses built and drained; also the number of gullies, ventilators, and manholes constructed in existing Sewers during the year:— Locality. No. of Houses Sanctioned to be Built and Drained. No. of House#, &c., sanctioned to be Drained. No. of Additions to Buildings sactioned. No. of Dwelling Houses and Public Buildings. &c., completed within the year. No. of Frontage Drains laid. No. of Gullies constructed in Public Roads. No. of Flushing Chambers constructed.

This is a work that is very much on the increase. The larger Sewers, vested in the Board, have been regularly inspected and cleansed. They are gone through about four times a year, but after heavy rains nnd Hooding, special examinations are made. About the average number of summonses were taken out for non-compliance of the Hoard's regulations as to ventilating house drains and commencing to build without giving notice. I am sorrv to say it was necessary to take out several summonses for allowing houses to be occupied before being drained. SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE. The following Table will give the Surface Drains sanctioned in each new street, and those laid or completed during the year:— Locality. Length in feet Size of Pipe, &c. Material. Remarks.

The return will be found at page 77, Minutes, 1882. During the year there have been 856 buildings constructed, and nearly five miles of Sewers of all sizes laid in roads. The Lord of the Manor of Lewisham removed several trees, as they were dangerous, and the Hoard planted 104 lime trees at Rushey Green, and six plane trees at St. Mary's Church, Lewisham, in order to compensate as much as possible for t he loss of the old trees. A small enclosure was also fenced in and planted near the "Lion and Lamb," Lewisham, on the site of the two elms. One of the common causes, at the present time, of stoppages in house drains is the objectionable contrivance called "waste-water preventers.' They are constantly out of order, the consequence i> the drains are not properly flushed after using the water closets. Indeed, when the apparatus is in working order, the quantity of water allowed as a flush is insufficient, and I am surprised the Water Companies ever obtained the powers to insist upon their use. The bed of the Quaggy was concreted from the eastern end of the Plough Bridge to the northern end of the High Pavement. The work was executed under contract bv Messrs. John Mowlem and Co., and the total cost was 17s. 10d, the Plumstead Board of Works contributing the sum of £57 17s. 9d. The Board contemplate extending this work, and also carrying out further works at the Silk Mills. The highest water occurred in the Ravensbourne upon the 28th of October. There was no flooding. Doubtless the work carried out last year proved of service. There were 27 communications from the Superintending Architect during the year relative to the frontage line of buildings. A Cart Shed, Store-rooms, and small office for the Inspector of Works, was built at the Forest Hill Stone-yard, from drawings, &c., 1 prepared. The work was executed under contract by Messrs. K ing and Otley, and cost £254 19s. 3d. Next year I hope to see the shed in the Penge Yard extended, and some improvements carried out there. 15 The following schemes were projected during the year affecting the Roads and Sewers of the district:— 1. Camber well and Penge Electric Lighting Provisional Order. 2. Greenwich and Lewisham Electric Lighting Provisional Order. 3. Last London, Crystal Palace, and South-eastern Junction Railway Bill. 4. Greenwich and Northern Lines Connecting Railway Bill. 5. South-eastern and Metropolitan (New Cross, Lewisham, and District) Tramway Bill. 6. Croydon Tramways Company and Norwood District Tramway Company Bill. None of these schemes have come to anything. My reports upon them will be found in the Minutes of the Board. There were 202 plans and tracings prepared in my office during the year, and a great many reports and estimates made and letters written. A list of New Streets sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works is appended to this Report. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble Servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst.
