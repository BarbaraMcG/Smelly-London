April, 1910. To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith, in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1909. The mortality statistics for the year are again of a very satisfactory character. The Birth Rate of 22.19 per 1,000 is slightly below that of the County of London, which figure was 24.2 per 1,000. The recorded Death Rate of 12.24 per 1,000 of the estimated population, compares favourably with 14.0 per 1,000, the Death Rale for the County of London, and with 14.7 per 1,000, the figure for the 76 large towns. Comparing Greenwich with the other Metropolitan Boroughs according to their corrected Death Rate, which is the fairest method of comparison, shows that Greenwich has the lowest Death Rate but 3 amongst the 29 Metropolitan Boroughs. The 3 Boroughs having a better Death Rate than Greenwich being Hampstead, Lewisham and Stoke Newington. Full particulars of all the Boroughs, in this respect, are to be found in the table on page 18. The Infantile Mortality Rate, for the Borough, measured by the number of deaths under one year to 1,000 births registered, was 102, a decrease of 18 compared with last year ; the figure for 10 London as a whole was 108, and the Borough average during the last five years, 1904.1908, inclusive, 121. The Zymotic Death Rate of 0.99 per 1,000 is .32 per 1,000 below the County average, viz., 1.31 per 1,000, and is 0.17 per 1,000 below the corresponding figure for last year. The figures relating to the different constituent parts of the Borough are as follows :— Districts. Birth Rate. Death Rate. Percentage of deaths under one year of age. Infantile Mortality per 1,000 Births. Zymotic Death Rate. Diarrhoea Death Rate. Con. sumption Death Rate.

I am, Gentlemen, Yours respectfully, ERNEST G. ANNIS. 11 VITAL AND MORTAL STATISTICS, 1909. POPULATION. The number of persons estimated to be living at the middle of the year is 111,014. This estimate is an increase of 1,904 upon the corresponding figure of last year. The natural increase of the population during the year, or the excess of the number of births over the number of deaths, is 1,101, which therefore allows 803 as the balance of immigrants over emigrants. The distribution of the population throughout the Borough is as follows :— Census, 1901. Estimated Population at middle of year 1909. East Greenwich 43,859 50,842 West Greenwich 23,456 27,188 St. Nicholas 7,321 8,486 Charlton 18,065 20,931 Kidbrooke 3,069 3,567 Total 95,770 111,014 MARRIAGES. The Superintendent.Registrar of the Greenwich Union has kindly furnished me with the particulars relating to the number of marriages solemnized in the Parishes of Greenwich and St. Nicholas. The Superintendent.Registrar for the Woolwich Union has also kindly supplied the particulars for the Parishes of Charlton and Kidbrooke, with the exception, in these latter particulars, that none of the marriages performed in the Woolwich Registrar.s Office and in Chapels in Charlton and Kidbrooke, of residents in those Parishes, are included. 12 The following table shews these particulars, giving the number of Marriages in Greenwich and St. Nicholas, &c., for each year since 1893.

The total number of births in the Borough during the year has been 2,492, but of these 45 occurred in Greenwich Union Infirmary, the address of the mother being in 45 cases in Deptford ; deducting these and adding 8 which were transferred from Stepney, Lambeth and St. Marylebone, it will be seen that the number of strictly Greenwich births for 1909 is 2,455, of which 1,262 were males and 1,193 females. This corrected figure gives a birth rate of 22.19 per 1,000 of the population, being the lowest on record, and 3.84 below the average for the last eight years, 1901 to 1908, the period since the formation of the Metropolitan Borough. 13 Amongst the total number of births registered in the Borough there were 79 in which the name of the father was not registered and therefore not given in the return ; accordingly these births may be presumed to be of an illegitimate character. 59 of such births were registered in the East Greenwich district, which includes the Infirmary of the Greenwich Union. In 26 cases the mother was ordinarily a resident in the Borough of Deptford, and accordingly this number of births have been transferred to that Borough. The remaining 53 were similarly allocated to the districts in this Borough to which the mother ordinarily resided, making 26 of such births belonging to East Greenwich, 15 t® West Greenwich, 6 to St. Nicholas, and 6 to Charlton. The birth rate for the County of London equals 24.2 per 1,000 of the population, and was the lowest rate recorded. It varied from 13.6 in the City of London, 14.4 in Hampstead, 16.2 in the City of Westminster, 18.2 in Holborn, 18.4 in Kensington, 18.5 in Chelsea, and 18.9 in Stoke Newington, up to 29.6 in Finsbury, 30.3 in Poplar, 30.5 in Stepney, 31.6 in Bethnal Green, 31.7 in Shoreditch, and 32 .3 in Bermondsey. The Notification of Births Act, 1907, was formally adopted by this Council on the 17 th March, 1909, coming into force within the District of the Borough on 14th May, 1909, since which time Intimations have been received from Medical Men, Parents, and others, with respect to the birth of children in 1262 cases, which number compared with 1581 notified by the Registrars of the several districts, and considering the additional trouble involved, for which no payment is made, is a very fair 14 proportion. I, however, still find many parents who up to the present are not aware of the provisions of the Act, and I think at no very distant date it would be a wise policy to again post circulars throughout the district drawing attention to its requirements. Copies of the notifications received are transmitted to the County Council as required by the Act, and from time to time the various District Registrars within the district consult our records shewing the actual notifications received. In one or two cases slight irregularities have been detected, particularly in connection with the address given to us where the birth has actually occurred and the address as furnished to the Registrar for the purposes of registering the birth. DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered during 1909 was 1,354, of which 690 were males, and 664 females. The crude death rate for the Borough of 12.24 per 1,000, compares favourably with 14.0, the death rate for the County of London, and 14.8 the death rate for the 76 large towns. In the County of London the lowest crude death rates amongst the various Metropolitan Boroughs were 8.9 in Hampstead, 10.3 in Lewisham, 11.3 in Stoke Newington, ll.9 in Wandsworth and Woolwich, 12.0 in Fulham, 12.2 in Greenwich, 12:6 in Hackney, and 12*9 in Paddington ; while the highest rates were 16.8 in Bethnal Green, 18.8 in Bermondsey, 19.0 in Shoreditch, 19.2 in Finsbury, and 20.3 in City of London. Locally, the death rate varied from 4.78 in Kidbrooke, 10.69 in Charlton, 11.90 in East Greenwich, and 13.43 in West Greenwich, to 17 .38 in St. Nicholas. 15 The following table shows the variation in, and average of, the death rates in each of the five Districts of the Borough in the five years 1904 to 1908, compared with the figures for 1909 :— District. 1904. 1905. 1900. 1907. 1908.

On that occasion Greenwich had the lowest death rate but four amongst the 29 Metropolitan Boroughs, whereas during 1909 Greenwich has improved to the lowest position but three, which can certainly be considered to be a very favourable position indeed. When one compares the position which Greenwich holds at this time with that which it held in the early years of the life of the Borough a considerable number of lives appear to have been saved, for during the year 1901 the crude death rate of Greenwich was 15.31 per 1,000, so that had the death rate during 1909 been the same as that of 1901 there would have been a total of 1,700 lives lost during the year, whereas the actual number of deaths was 1,354, showing a total saving of 354 lives, 16 from which it may naturally be deduced that the amount of sickness and ill.health during the year has also been considerably less than during 1901. For if one calculates that one in every ten illnesses terminates fatally, it would seem to show that there had been 3,460 less attacks of serious illness during the year. Undoubtedly if this condition of things continues, and still further increases, as it is sincerely hoped may be the case, it will be a cause of considerable apprehension to the members of the medical profession generally. The figures, comparing the year 1909 with that of 1902 are also very similar in character. 17 DEATHS IN INSTITUTIONS.

The Infantile Mortality, measured by the deaths of children under one year of age to the number of births registered, was 102 per 1,000 births, being the lowest figures as yet recorded for this Borough, there having been a total of 251 such deaths during the year, as compared with 310, 259, and 320, the figures for the three preceding years. The number for the County of London was 108 per 1,000 births. The lowest rates of Infantile Mortality amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs were 74 per 1,000 births in Lewisham, 75 in Hampstead, 80 in Stoke Newington, and 82 in Woolwich; whilst the highest were 120 in Hammersmith, 129 in Bethnal Green and Poplar, 131 in Finsbury, 138 in Bermondsey, and 140 in Shoreditch. Locally, the variations were from 59 per 1,000 births in Kidbrooke, 97 in West Greenwich, 100 in East Greenwich, 105 in Charlton, and 129 in St. Nicholas; the following table compares, at a glance, these figures for the years since the formation of the Borough :— District.

Infective Diseases. Epidemic. There were 126 deaths due to this class of diseases, equalling a death rate of 1.14 per 1,000; the rate last year was 1.47, and was 1.65 and 1.95 in 1907 and 1906 respectively. The Zymotic Death Rate for the County of London equals 1.31 per 1,000, wherein it varied from 0.52 in Hampstead, 0.57 in Lewisham, 0.63 in the City of Westminster and Stoke Newington, 0.72 in the City of London, and 0.83 in St. Marylebone, up to 2.36 in Finsbury, 2.37 in Poplar, 2.74 in Bermondsey, and 2.87 in Shoreditch. Locally, the Zymotic Death Rate varied from nil in Kid. brooke (O.OO in 1908), 0.74 in West Greenwich (1.07 in 1908), l.Ol in Charlton (1.24 in 1908), l.03 in East Greenwich (120 in 1908), up to 2.01 in St. Nicholas (l.53 in 1908). Small.pox. There were no deaths from this disease in 1909, this being the seventh year since a death occurred from this cause in the Borough. Measles. Thirty.eight deaths were ascribed as due to this disease, three only of the patients being over five years of age; compared with 16 which occurred in 1908, 55, 29 and 18 deaths were recorded in the three preceding years. Twenty.two of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich, 6 in St. Nicholas, 6 in Charlton, and 4 in West Greenwich. The quarterly incidence was 30 in the first, and 4, 1 and 3 respectively in the succeeding quarters. 23 Scarlet Fever. This disease occasioned 8 deaths, 3 being under and 5 over five years of age; there were 9 in East Greenwich, 5 in West Greenwich, and 3 each in St. Nicholas and Charlton. Six such deaths occurred in 1908 and 10 in 1907. Diphtheria. There were 7 deaths from this disease during 1909. This gives a death rate for Diphtheria of 0.06, comparing with 0.16, the rate for 1908. Eighteen deaths occurred in 1908, which were attributed to this cause, and 20, 30 and 15 in the three preceding years. Five of the patients were under five years of age, all of them dying in the Brook Hospital, and 2 of the patients were over five years of age, and these died in the Brook Hospital. There was a further number of 29 deaths from Diphtheria in patients not ordinarily resident in this Borough, but under treatment at the Brook Hospital. Twenty.four tubes of Diphtheria Anti.toxin, containing a total of 96,000 units of serum, for the treatment of patients suffering from this disease, have been supplied by this Council during the year. Whooping Cough. This disease was given as the cause of 20 deaths in 1909, as against 31, 26 and 41 in the three preceding years. These deaths equal a rate of 0.18 per 1,000. There were no patients over five years of age. Nine of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich, 5 in West Greenwich, 3 in St. Nicholas, and 3 in Charlton. Typhoid Fever. There were three deaths ascribed as due to this disease; there were 9 in 1908 and 5 each in 1907, 1906 and 1905, and 8 in 1904. One of the deaths was in East 24 Greenwich, 1 in West Greenwich, and 1 in St. Nicholas. One was being treated in the Brook Hospital, one in the Miller Hospital, and one in the Seamen.s Hospital. Diarrhœa and Zymotic Enteritis. Thirty.four deaths were stated to be due to this cause, equalling a rate of 0 31 per 1,000. Last year there were 49 deaths, and 33, 66 and 81 respectively in the three preceding years. The deaths were distributed as follows:—Fifteen in East Greenwich, 5 in West Greenwich, 6 in St. Nicholas, and 8 in Charlton. Three patients were over five years of age. Influenza. Influenza is found to have been the responsible cause in 16 deaths in 1908; 24 was the average of the previous three years. Of the 16, 6 were over sixty.five years of age. Sporadic Diseases. There were no deaths from this class of disease during the year. Venereal. Syphilis. Five deaths were given as due to Syphilis, as against 4 in 1908, and 9 in 1907. Of these 5 deaths, 4 were children under five years of age. Two occurred in East Greenwich, two in West Greenwich, and 1 in St. Nicholas. Three of the deceased persons were in the Greenwich Union Infirmary. There were no deaths from Gonorrhoea during the year. Septic. Erysipelas. One death occurred from this cause in 1909, 5 in 1908, 3 in 1907, and 2 in 1906. Puerperal Fever. There were 4 deaths from this disease during the year. 24a. This Diagram gives in comparative form the Deaths from those Diseases which have caused the principal amount of Mortality during 1909, 25 Pyæmia and Septicemia. There were 4 deaths from this disease during the year. Infective Endocarditis. Two deaths were ascribed to this cause, 1 in East Greenwich and 1 in West Greenwich. The numbers were 3 in 1908, and 2 in 1907. There was one death from the other diseases of the septic class. Malarial. Rheumatic Fever. This disease was the cause of 4 deaths in 1909, as compared with 6 in 1908, 6 in 1907, and 3 in 1906. Rheumatism of the Heart and Malarial Fever were each given as the cause of a death. Tuberculosis. This class includes the causes of 146 deaths during the year under review, with a rate of 1.32 ; these figures compare with 171, 143, and 161, the totals of the previous three years, and respective rates of 1.54, 1.34, and 1.53. Tuberculosis of Lungs (Consumption) is, as usual, credited with the major portion of these deaths, there being 112 attributed to this cause, or rate of 1.01 per 1,000, comparing with 1.31 per 1,000, the phthisis death rate for the whole of London. Amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs this death rate ranged from 0.61 in Hampstead, 0.80 in Lewisham, 0.83 in Stoke Newington, 0.93 in Wandsworth, 0.96 in Kensington, up to 1.78 in Bermondsey, 1.79 in Southwark, 2.05 in Holborn, 2.15 in City of London, and 2.22 in Finsbury. Locally, the deaths were 2 in Kidbrooke, giving a death rate of 0.56 ; 16 in St. Nicholas, giving a death rate of 1.89 ; 17 in Charlton, giving a death rate of 0.81 ; 28 in West Greenwich, 26 giving a death rate of 1.03 ; and 49 in East Greenwich, giving a death rate of 0.97 per 1,000. The remaining forms of Tuberculosis were responsible for 34 deaths, 19 being in East Greenwich, 7 in West Greenwich, 2 in St. Nicholas, and 6 in Charlton. Of these other forms of Tuberculosis, Tuberculosis of the Brain or its Membranes was credited with 18, 14 being under five years of age ; Tubercle affecting the Intestines, 3 deaths (2 being under five years of age); General Tuberculosis, 12 deaths (5 under and 7 over five); and other forms 1. The voluntary notification of cases of Consumption continues in force in the Borough and is, as the figures show, still appreciated by medical men in the district; 193 such notifications have been received and dealt with during the year, the numbers in preceding years having been 107, 107, 112, 109. Seventy-seven of these notifications were in East Greenwich, 43 in West Greenwich, 67 in St. Nicholas, and 6 in Charlton. These are dealt with in more detail on page 46. Parasitic Diseases. There were no deaths from this class of disease. , Dietic Diseases. There were 6 deaths from this class of disease, giving a rate of 0.05. Four from chronic alcoholism, and 2 from acute alcoholism. Constitutional Diseases. The deaths from this cause were 102 in number, which gives a rate of 0'92 per 1,000. Of these 88 were attributed to Cancer, 7 to Diabetes, 3 to Gout, 2 to Anaemia, and 1 each to Osteo-Arthritis and Lymphadenoma. The deaths from Cancer were distributed as follows : 40 occurred 27 in East Greenwich, 16 in West Greenwich, 9 in St. Nicholas, 20 in Charlton, and 3 in Kidbrooke. Developmental Diseases. There were 259 deaths from this class of causes, equal to a rate of 2.34 per 1,000. These may roughly be divided into those from causes whichwould appear to be unavoidable, viz. :—Atelectasis 5, Congenital defects 12, and those from causes more or less preventible, viz.:— Premature birth 47, Injury at birth 3, Debility at birth 6, Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus 35, and Rickets 4. The remaining and largest portion of these deaths from developmental diseases, 147 in number, were from Old Age; in 1908 there were 134 deaths from this cause, and 139 in the previous year. Local Diseases. Nervous System. One hundred and forty-four deaths were attributed to the various nervous diseases, which gives a rate of 1.30 per 1,000 ; last year the rate was 1.11 per 1,000. Convulsions were responsible for 14, all being under 5 years of age; 13 were from Meningitis, 63 from Apoplexy, 8 from Softening of the Brain, 13 from Hemiplegia or Brain Paralysis, 9 from General Paralysis of the Insane, 1 from other forms of Insanity, 5 from Cerebral Tumour, 8 from Epilepsy, 2 from Locomotor Ataxy, 5 from Paraplegia, and 3 from the other diseases of this system. Organs of Special Sense. There were 3 deaths from this class of causes, equal to a rate of 0.03 per 1,000. Circulatory System. The death rate from diseases of this system was 1.20 per 1,000, there being a total of 133 such deaths. Valvular diseases of the heart were responsible for 119 ;. 28 4 each from Aneurism and Angina Pectoris, 3 from Embolism, and from the remaining diseases of this system, 3. Respiratory System. Two hundred and thirty-seven deaths were due to diseases of the respiratory organs, as compared with 201 in the preceding year. The death rate under this heading equals 2.14 per 1,000. 41 were from Acute and 72 from Chronic Bronchitis ; 111 from the various forms of Pneumonia, 55 being under 5 years of age; 5 were from Asthma, 6 from Pleurisy, 1 from the other diseases of the Respiratory System, and 1 from the diseases of the Larynx. Digestive System. There were 73 deaths from diseases of this system, equal to a rate of 0.66 per 1,000. Enteritis was responsible for 25, 21 being under 5 years of age ; 4 were due to Ulcer of stomach and duodenum, 7 to Appendicitis, 12 to obstruction or other diseases of the intestine, 9 to Cirrhosis and 6 to other diseases of the liver, 7 to Peritonitis, and 3 to the other diseases of the digestive system. Lymphatic System. There were four deaths from diseases affecting this system, equal to a rate of 0.04 per 1,000. Urinary System. Thirty-six deaths, equal to a rate of 0.33 per 1,000, occurred from diseases affecting this system. 24 were from Bright's Disease, 5 from Acute Nephritis, and 7 from diseases of the Bladder and Prostate. Reproductive System. Diseases of the generative organs were the cause of three deaths. There were five deaths attributed to diseases of Parturition. Bones and Joints. There were five deaths from diseases of bones and joints. 29 Integumentary System. Diseases of this class were the cause of two deaths. External Causes. There were 47 deaths given as due to causes grouped under this heading; 39 were the result of accident or negligence, and the remaining 8 were from Suicide. Suffocation, by being overlaid in bed, was the cause of death of 1 child under five years of age; 4 cases were from drowning, while accidents on railways, in vehicular traffic and in building operations and falls were responsible for 34 deaths. The Suicides were by hanging in 3 cases, 2 by cut or stab, and 1 each by asphyxia, poison and shooting. No death has been left so insufficiently described as to need classification under the ill-defined causes heading, and this is a most satisfactory feature. MORTUARY.

During the year 879 cases have been notified under the above Act, as compared with 887, 1,134, and 1,221, respectively, in the preceding years, 1908, 1907. and 1906. Small-pox. No case of this disease was notified during the year in persons residing in this Borough. 30 The last case of this disease notified being in the year 1905, and as during the whole of this period the number of unprotected persons has been gradually increasing, certainly not to any very large extent in this Borough, but to a much greater extent in some other portions of London, and as it is now about 7 or 8 years since the incidence of the last serious outbreak of Small-pox in London, it is very probable that the time is rapidly drawing nearer when we should be fully prepared for another outbreak. The following thoughts respecting protection from vaccination which have been drawn up and circulated by a leading health authority may be of use :— Protection from Vaccination. Clear argument depends on clear definition. The following points may be a guide as to the teaching of experience in regard to the protective influence of vaccination. (1) A person who has recovered from a disease such as Small-pox is, as a rule, protected from having the same disease again. (2) This protection is very marked immediately upon recovery, but it fades with time ; thus, after 23 years, second attacks of Small-pox may occur. (3) Vaccination, which is Small-pox changed into a mild disease by its passage through the cow, similarly protects against Small-pox. (4) The protection is very marked immediately after vaccination, but it also fades with time, and, as the disease is milder, its protection is less; thus, after 10 years, once vaccinated persons are again liable to contract Small-pox, though they will probably have it in much milder form than if they had never been vaccinated. 31 (5) After 20 or 30 years, the protection has faded very greatly, and such persons may suffer from severe Small-pox, even though vaccinated in infancy. (6) It is necessary, then, to avoid risk of Small-pox, to repeat vaccination after 10 years of age. This revaccination renews the protection, and is generally sufficient, except for doctors and nurses, who, being much exposed, are wise to renew their protection, and so make certain, every few years. After a second vaccination it rarely produces a bad arm. (7) Persons are not protected until the vaccination produces its constitutional symptoms at the end of about eight days. (8) Hence, because a person of 30 or 40, who has been -vaccinated in infancy, dies of Small-pox, it is no argument against the protection of a recent vaccination; it simply shows that he has neglected to renew the temporary protection conferred by infant vaccination, which is sure to fade with advancing years. (9) Again, if a person is exposed to Small-pox for six days and is then vaccinated, the Small-pox will show itself in six more days, before the vaccination has had time (eight days) to fully protect the constitution ; this, then, is no argument against vaccination, but it is strong argument against delay in securing revaccination until it may be too late. Even in such a case, the late vaccination will control the severity of the attack, and there is a vast difference between a very mild case involving no danger to life and a severe case such as occurs in the unprotected. (10) Persons who have secured the renewed constitutional protection of revaccination before being exposed to Small-pox, run 32 no risk. This is definitely established by the experience of doctors, nurses, and others dealing daily with Small-pox in hospital wards. (11) Vaccination or revaccination that does not " take," does not count as protective vaccination. (12) Any arguments not based on these rules, which are the basis of modern advice as to vaccination, are invalid and not to the point, though they may mislead people who do not think carefully. (13) Small-pox is not caused by impure water supplies, bad drainage, uncleanliness, or any insanitary conditions; it is a disease which developes only in susceptible persons, who catch it from Small-pox patients directly or indirectly. (14) Two things, then, are necessary in stopping Small-pox; first, isolation of patients and destruction of infection in their immediate clothes and surroundings; secondly, the rendering other persons insusceptible by renewing their vaccination protection at least once after ten years. By doing this Germany has practically abolished the disease, and has no need for Small-pox hospitals. (15) In every epidemic of Small-pox, what happens is exactly what should happen if the above propositions are true. We may, therefore, assume that they are true. (16) Jenner discovered a principle, but he could not have the advantage of the following 100 years' experience as to its actual scope and limitations. It is no reproach to him that he lacked our experience, nor to us that we avail ourselves of subsequent observation and experiment. Return for the period July to December, 1908.

One hundred and fifty-five cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year, as compared with 221, 253, 397 and 144, respectively, in the four previous years. The distribution of these cases was as follows:—63 in East Greenwich, 48 in West Greenwich, 16 in St. Nicholas, 21 in Charlton, and 7 in Kidbrooke. Of this total number 132 were removed to the Hospital for treatment. There were 7 fatalities due to this disease, which gives a case mortality of 4.5 per cent. Eight hundred and ninety-one specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from cases suspected to be Diphtheria. Of this number, 754 were reported to give negative or doubtful results, and 137 were positive in character, being dealt with accordingly. The quarterly incidence of the disease for 1909 has been as follows :— 1 st Quarter—East Greenwich, 18 cases; West Greenwich, 16 ; St. Nicholas, 3 ; Charlton, 6 ; Kidbrooke, 2 ; a total of 45 cases. '2nd Quarter—East Greenwich, 18 cases; West Greenwich, 5; St. Nicholas, 4 ; Charlton, 7 ; Kidbrooke, 2; a total of 36 cases. 3rd Quarter—East Greenwich, 15 cases ; West Greenwich, 18 ; St. Nicholas, 4 ; Charlton, 4; a total of 41 cases. 4th Quarter—East Greenwich, 12 cases; West Greenwich, 9; St. Nicholas 5 ; Charlton, 4 ; Kidbrooke, 3; a total of 33 cases. o Entric Fever ZYMOTIC DISEASES NOTIFIED. ° Erysipelas Shewing the Number of Cases of these Diseases notified during each week throughout the year 1909. • Small Pox ZYMOTIC DISEASES NOTIFIED. .Scarlet Fever . Diphtheria Shewing the Number of Cases of these Diseases notified during each week throughout the year 1903. 37 During the past year the active measures adopted to combat this disease have been continued, and if possible somewhat strengthened. Since the beginning of the year, after conferring with the Medical Staff of the London County Council, it was arranged that in connection both with Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever no children who had been absent from School either as patients or as contacts in connection with these two diseases should be re-admitted until such time as the School authority received a certificate from this department stating that in our opinion the child or children might resume school attendance without fear of spreading the infection. The system generally adopted to carry this into effect is as follows :—on the receipt of notification of a case, the premises are visited and if desired the patient's removal to hospital is arranged ; thereupon the premises are disinfected and all other children excluded from school attendance in the usual way. A further visit is paid in about 10 days, and should no other case have arisen in this family a certificate is then issued both to the school, to the parents of the child, and to the Medical Officer of Education, stating that such children may now resume school attendance. Although this system entails a considerable amount of extra work on this department in the way of additional visits and re-visits, yet I believe it has been instrumental in checking the spread of these diseases, because we have occasionally been able to stop suspicious children from resuming school attendance at too early a date. Several of the Head teachers of the Schools in this district also have expressed their thanks and gratitude to me for this assistance, as it materially assists them in efficiently carrying out their work. The following unfortunate occurrence shows, first the 38 difficulty attendant upon deciding when any particular case ceases to be infectious even although continually negative bacteriological results are obtained, and, secondly, how rapidly this disease spreads, and how particularly fatal it becomes in any what may be termed virgin soil:— A patient, G. C., was admitted to the Brook Hospital on March 16th, from the Royal Hospital School in this District, suffering from Scarlet Fever. The patient was transferred to the Convalescent Hospital on April 15th. A case of Diphtheria occurred in the Ward in which this patient was an inmate, whereupon bacteriological cultivations were made of specimens from all the occupants in this Ward, with a result that this patient, G. C., was found to be harbouring Diphtheria bacilli. He was isolated and treated for this disease, making to all appearances a very satisfactory recovery. Ten bacteriological examinations were made with respect to this patient during the time he was under treatment. The first eight up till June 30th giving generally positive results, the latter two taken during the beginning of July both from the nose and throat gave consistently negative results. Throughout the whole of his stay at the Hospital he showed no clinical signs of Diphtheria whatever, being discharged on July 7th. On his discharge he was kept isolated for a few days and then allowed to mix with the other boys in the School. No case of Diphtheria arose in the School between the date of this patient's discharge from the Hospital and the closing of the School for the summer vacation. Unfortunately, however, one boy as soon as he reached home developed the disease and died in two days ; the patient, G. C., went to his home in a somewhat isolated part of Ireland on July 30th, and after his return home five members of the family 39 speedily developed the disease, the first one commencing to be ill about three days after his arrival, and unfortunately two of the cases rapidly proved fatal. There had been no case of Diphtheria in that part of Ireland for the previous 15 years. Ten cases which were notified as Diphtheria and removed to the Hospital, were returned after varying periods of observation as not suffering from this disease; 5 were stated to be suffering from Tonsillitis, 2 from Broncho-Pneumonia, and 1 each from Nephritis, Measles, and 1 not stated. Erysipelas. Ninety-four cases were notified during the year, 30 being in East Greenwich, 26 in West Greenwich, 31 in St. Nicholas, 6 in Charlton, and 1 in Kidbrooke. Fifteen of these patients were removed to Public Institutions in the District. Scarlet Fever. Three hundred and ninety cases were notified during the year, as compared with 423, 660 and 566 cases, respectively, in the three preceding years; 137 cases were in East Greenwich, 85 in West Greenwich, 34 in St. Nicholas, 110 in Charlton, and 24 in Kidbrooke; 361 of these cases were removed to the Hospital for treatment. There were 8 deaths from this disease during the year, as against 6 last year. Nine of the cases removed to the Hospital as suffering from Scarlet Fever were returned as wrongly diagnosed, and 4 stated to be Tonsillitis, 1 each Gastritis,. Erythemia, Influenza and Peri Tonsillar Abscess, no alternative disease, however, being stated in the remaining case, while 8 patients on discharge were still suffering, 2 each from Chronic Rhinorrhoea, Chronic Otorrhcea, and 1 each from Chronic Watery Rhinitis, Chronic Rhinitis, Occasional Rhinorrhcea, and Occasional Otorrhcea, and parents were duly notified of this. The following Table gives particulars of the ten cases which would seem to be " return cases," There were eight such cases in 1908, five in 1907, and four in 1906.

There were 28 cases of Typhoid Fever notified during the year, 8 being in East Greenwich, 10 in West Greenwich, 2 in St. Nicholas, 4 in Charlton, and 4 in Kidbrooke. The ages of the patients were: 5 between one and 5 years, 2 between five and fifteen years, 7 between fifteen and twenty-five years, and 14 between twenty-five and sixty-five years. Of the total number of cases, 24 were removed to the hospital for treatment. Thirty-four such cases occurred in 1908, and 18 in 1907 ; the average number for the years 1901 to 1908 inclusive, being 44. Of the total number removed to the Hospital for treatment nine cases, however, were returned, as in the opinion of the Medical Superintendent not suffering from Typhoid Fever, 1 being considered to be suffering from Broncho-pneumonia, 1 Enteritis, 3 Pneumonia, 1 Pleurisy, 1 Colitis, 1 Pelvic Tumour, 1 Suppurative Salpingitis. There were 3 fatalities from this disease during the year, 1 belonging to East Greenwich, 1 to West Greenwich, and 1 to St. Nicholas. Twenty-one specimens were forwarded for bacteriological •examination from cases suspected to be Typhoid Fever in character, and of this number 17 gave a negative result, and 4 were positive in character.

There are no full statistics obtainable as to the incidence of this disease, it not being now notifiable. Measles. Seven hundred and ninety-five cases of Measles were notified to this department by parents, guardians, school teachers, and others during the year. In each case visits were paid to the infected premises, and the usual measures of disinfection generally carried out. In the previous years, 1908,. 1907 and 1906, they were respectively 497, 1,245, and 482. The fatalities from this disease for the present year were 38 in the preceding years, 16, 55, and 29 deaths respectively occurred. The following Tables show the occurrence of this disease as to quarterly, district, and age incidence :— 44 Table shewing number of Measles Cases reported during the year 1909. 1ST QUARTER.

There were four cases of this disease notified during the year, one of which was in East Greenwich, and three in St. Nicholas. All the patients were between the ages of 5 and 15 years. In the case of J.R., the East Greenwich patient, he was removed to Guy's Hospital, having been suffering from severe pains in the back for about a fortnight. The patient had difficulty in opening his mouth, and became unable to stand, and suffered from slight general spasms. No eruption was noticed, but he died about two hours after his admission to the Hospital. On examination of the cerebro-spinal fluid after death, the specific micro-organism of this disease was discovered, and until this had been found, the case had been considered to be one of Tetanus. The conditions of the house where the patient lived were quite satisfactory, clean, and not at all verminous, and no other illness had effected other inmates of the house for a considerable period. The other three cases were all members of one family, and were removed to the Hospital for treatment. On investigation by the Staff of this Department, it was thought however, that the illness was doubtless attributable to indiscretion in diet, and the Hospital authorities speedily also came to this conclusion, the patients being discharged in a few days. The chief article of diet which attracted our attention in this respect was a meat pie which the mother informed us she had made from the cleanings obtained from bullocks' ears, this article of diet appearing to be considered somewhat of a delicacy in the neighbourhood of the Foreign Cattle Market. Isolation Shelter. This shelter was used on 3 occasions during the year for the usual period to accommodate persons displaced for purposes of disinfection. 46 Contacts. Intimation was received from the Medical Officer of Health to the various Port Sanitary Authorities on 39 occasions during the year in this connection, on 33 occasions with respect to persons coming to an address in this district from a vessel where cases of cholera had developed, on four occasions from vessels which had had a Small-pox case on board, and two occasions when typhoid fever had been present. Each of these persons was kept under observation. Glanders. Under the recent order making Glanders in Horses notifiable to the Local Authority there have been during the year two different outbreaks notified. Enquiries have been made in each case, but no human Glanders has appeared to result therefrom. During the year an order has been approved by the London County Council making compulsorily notifiable under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the County of London, the diseases known as Glanders, Anthrax and Hydrophobia in man. No notification of these diseases have been received during the year. Consumption. During the year there were 193 cases of Consumption voluntarily notified, 77 being in East Greenwich, 43 in West Greenwich, 67 in St. Nicholas, and 6 in Charlton. Of this number 67 cases were under treatment in an Institution. The ages of the patients were, 3 under 1 year of age, 8 between 1 and 5 years, 25 between 5 and 15 years, 29 between 15 and 25 years, 120 between 25 and 65 years, and 8 over 65 years. Thirty specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from patients suspected to be -consumptive j 25 were reported to be negative, and 5 positive. 47 Disinfection has been offered and carried out in 47 cases, including 66 rooms and 75 articles of bedding, &c.; disinfectant has also been supplied to patients to disinfect sputum, &c.

From which it will be seen that during the year there were a total of 103 patients notified, 28 of them being already in Poor Law Institutions, and 75 being patients outside such Institutions, concerning which patients we received 20 intimations of change of addresses, a further 29 second notifications from other Poor Law Medical Practitioners, and 3 third such notifications, whilst 13 second notifications of changes of address, and 6 third such notifications were also received. GREENWICH HEALTH SOCIETY. This Society continues to make slow but satisfactory progress in the Borough. Its operations, however, are considerably hampered by lack of sufficient suitable visitors. The difficulty mentioned last year concerning the somewhat belated knowledge as to births, has been entirely overcome by the adoption in this Borough of the Notification of Births Act, so that now it is possible 48 for the visitors to have in their hands the addresses of houses where births have occurred and their visits are considered as likely to be helpful within practically one week of the birth of the child. There are also three public consultation stations open in the Borough now, each being attended by a local medical man, as well as the lady visitors in turn, to which poor mothers are encouraged to bring their babies so that they may be advised as to their feeding, upbringing, &c., and where they are periodically weighed and generally have a sympathetic interest taken in them. Meetings have also been held during the year addressed by various medical men in order to help the visitors in satisfactorily carrying out their duties.

The Table on pages 71 to 75 summarizes, as far as is possible, the Sanitary Work of the Department; from this it will be seen that a total of 14,561 houses and premises have been inspected or reinspected during the year; 1,237 intimation notices have been served, and 338 statutory notices. With the exception of prosecutions in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, it was only found necessary to institute Police Court proceedings in eight cases, three being in connection with nuisances from the emission of black smoke, one being for not having a proper and sufficient water supply to an occupied house ; one for deficiency of water closet accommodation ; one for having the premises dirty; one under the Bylaws with reference to paving of yards, and one for having no name or address on an Ice Cream barrow or stall. There were altogether throughout the year 261 complaints entered in the Public Complaint Register of the Department; these were in each case carefully investigated, and any necessary action immediately taken, thus there are none of these matters left outstanding or unattended to. Bakehouses. Two hundred and fourteen inspections have been made of the various Bakehouses in the Borough, and 31 nuisances found therein have been abated as the result. Factories and Workshops. Three hundred and ten inspections have been paid to these premises within the Borough during the year. There were 242 workshop premises on the 52 Register at the beginning of the year, 17 have been added during the year, and 21 have been taken off, leaving a total now on the Register of 238. This total number includes 19 laundries, 35 dressmakers, 8 fuel and firewood works, 4 cycle works, 6 milliners, and various others, including workplaces, such as 4 blacksmiths, 12 barge builders, 3 builders' yards, &c. Information has been sent to H.M. Inspector of Factories with respect to 10 new workshops and one new factory, and also 10 instances where protected persons were employed on premises no abstract being displayed. One complaint has been received from H.M. Inspector and also 13 intimations respecting alleged new workshops ; of these 13 however, only six were really new premises, the other seven relating to premises which had already been notified by us to H.M. Inspector. The inspections have revealed the presence of defects or insanitary conditions requiring the service of many verbal, and in addition, 45 written notices, 17 of these being in respect of workshops, including workshop laundries, 21 in respect of workplaces, and 7 in respect of factories, including factory laundries. The notices had reference to want of cleanliness generally in 105 cases, want of ventilation in 3 cases, want of drainage of floors in 6 cases, overcrowding in 1 case, insufficient sanitary accommodation in 6 cases, unsuitable or defective sanitary accommodation 15 cases, and other nuisances 31 cases. These defects have all been attended to. Outworkers' Registers. Fifty-nine lists of Outworkers, containing 182 names and addresses, have been received during the year from Medical Officers of Health for other Districts ; 26 lists, containing 195 names, have been received from employers 53 within the District; 35 lists, containing 81 names, have been forwarded to other Districts, thus giving a total of 296 names and addresses of outworkers within the Borough. Two hundred and eighty-eight visits of inspection have been made to these premises, and insanitary conditions, mainly want of cleanliness, have been revealed in 25 instances; 25 written notices were served with respect to these matters.

Inspectors 1 Other Underground Bakehouses (s. 101) :— In use during 1908 18 Certificates granted in 1909 In use at the end of 1909 18 Slaughter Houses. The slaughter houses in the Borough have been inspected on 70 occasions by the Inspectors. 57 Cowhouses. The four cowhouses in the Borough have been visited on 16 occasions, and the required cleansing has been duly enforced on 12 occasions. Horse Slaughterer. The one horse-slaughtering house in the Borough has been visited by the Inspector on 24 occasions, and cleansing of the premises was required on six of these visits. Other Scheduled Offensive Trades. The 63 other premises where these offensive trades are carried on, notably within the precincts of the Foreign Animals' Wharf, Deptford, have been frequently visited, and the requirements of this Authority have always immediately received attention. Considerable works of redrainage of the Slaughter Houses, Tripe Hoyses, &c., have been carried out during the year, and other measures in connection with the methods of dealing with the manure, offal, &c. The case of the London Butchers Hide & Skin Company, Ltd., v. London County Council, with respect to the license of the Oleo Works at the Foreign Cattle Market has at last been settled. The London County Council having sanctioned the establishment anew of the business of a fat melter at the premises of the London Butchers Hide & Skin Company, Ltd., at the Foreign Cattle Market in pursuance of Section 19 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order. At the commencement of the year, there were 210 premises on the Register of Dairies and Milkshops; 10 new applications have been received during the year and added to the Register, and 14 names have been taken off, thus leaving a total of 206 premises 58 now registered. During the year 272 visits of inspection have been paid to these premises; notices were served upon the occupiers in 12 cases, 8 of which were for dirty premises generally, in 5 cases for dirty milk vessels and utensils, and in 3 instances for general insanitary conditions. Under the powers conferred by the London County Council (General) Powers Act, 1908, Section 5, with respect to the registration of premises unsuitable for the sale of milk, such registration has been refused on the grounds of the unsuitability of the premises in 17 cases. Ice Cream Premises. There were 115 premises known at the commencement of the year where the manufacture of thiscommodity was carried on, 13 have been added during the year and 10 taken off, leaving atotalof 118 premises. These premiseswere inspected on 157 occasions, and improvements, either by way of cleansing of the premises in 13 cases, or the remedying of sanitary defects in 8 cases, and 3 suitable ash receptacles required. In the course of our inspections of the itinerant vendors of ice cream and such commodities particularly at holiday times on the open spaces in the district, we have met with the following anomaly which certainly seems as if it might easily be remedied :— Section 43 of the London County Council (General) Powers Act, 1902, requires every itinerant vendor of such commoditiesto exhibit in a legible manner on a conspicuous part of his barrow his name and address. Some of these itinerant vendors wheel their ice cream barrows on to the Heath, such barrow not having any name and address displayed thereon as required by this section, but on arriving on the Heath, doubtless for the purpose 59 of securing more stability for their stand, thereupon remove the wheels from the barrow which then apparently becomes a stall or stand and not a barrow, this stand likewise having no name or address upon it, and in this way the provisions of the Act are evaded. A test case of this sort was taken before the Magistrate at the Greenwich Police Court, when he decided that we had no case and the summons was dismissed on the ground that the barrow had now become a stand or stall and no barrow. The attention of the London County Council has been drawn to this difficulty, and it is to be hoped that an early amendment of the Act in this respect will be effected. Food Preparation. Places where food is prepared have been visited on 156 occasions, improvements being required in 41 instances, as detailed below :— Class of Premises. At end of 1908. Number Added 1909. on Lists.

Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. Fifty-seven applications were received during the year for certificates under these Acts. Certificates were granted in 8 cases and refused in the remaining 49 cases. Housing of the Working Classes. Premises have been found to be overcrowded in 25 cases, which have all been abated, and in 4 cases the illegal use of underground rooms has been discontinued. Three hundred and seventy-four houses have been generally repaired; 202 premises have been cleansed, limewashed, and repaired ; 29 have been improved as regards their ventilation; 206 premises have had the walls and ceilings cleansed throughout, and 224 premises have been partially cleansed; leaky house roofs and gutters have been repaired in 283 cases; nuisances from dampness have been abated in 106 cases; dampness of walls have been remedied in 81 cases; direct connection between the internal sanitary fittings of houses and the drain have been disconnected, trapped, and amended in 209 cases; similarly 138 stack pipes have been disconnected trapped, and amended; 1 house has been abolised as unfit for habitation; and want of underfloor ventilation has also been attended to in 1 case. The Clerk of the Roan Schools Foundation forwarded to this Council a communication desiring the proposal of a scheme under the Housing of the Working Classes Act to deal with certain premises at the corner of Church Street and Roan Passage ; this was referred to your Medical Officer of Health who made a 61 thorough investigation of the whole of these premises, reporting upon the matter to the Public Health Committee, who thereupon decided that no scheme was necessary. Certain insanitary conditions found in the premises were authorised to be dealt with by notice upon the respective landlords, and a communication to this effect was forwarded to the Governors of the Roans Charity. Houses Let in Lodgings. Out of a number of such premises which have been reported to the Committee, it has been decided during 1909 to register 44, which together with the twenty-four on the register at the end of 1908, gives a total of 68 premises on the Register of Houses Let in Lodgings at the end of the year. Difficulties have again been experienced in connection with the working of the By-laws relating to this matter which has again necessitated considerable correspondence between the Local Government Board and the Council with a view to further radical amendments in such By-laws, and up to the present the final amendments have not yet been definitely settled. In one of the draft forms received by this Council from the Local Government Board, it appeared as if that Board contemplated placing the liability for attending to all the requirements of the By-laws upon the landlord, who might or might not be the person actually subletting the premises, thereby bringing the premises within the purview of these By-laws. Whereas this Council has endeavoured to throw the responsibility of attending to certain requirements upon the person who actually received the enhanced profit resulting from the sub-letting in lodgings. This conflict of opinion has taken several months to satisfactorily arrange. House Drainage. Two hundred and eighty-three house drainage systems have been reconstructed; 211 such systems 62 have also been opened, cleansed and amended; 78 new systems and 199 surface drains have been constructed; 72 systems have been tested by smoke and 342 by water, of which number 257 were found to be defective ; 84 new soil pipes and 485 traps have been fixed, together with 57 intercepting chambers, and 46 other chambers. Nineteen cesspools have been abolished; 63 areas, 103 yards, and 9 mews and stables have been thoroughly drained. Twenty-nine water closets and 1 urinal have been erected; a pan, trap and water supply have been furnished throughout in 150 cases, and other fittings in 274 cases, whilst the water supply has been renewed in 121 instances. The water supply for lavatory purposes has been disconnected from the drinking water system in 11 instances. Fifty-nine public-house urinals have been cleansed and repaired, whilst a water supply has been laid on or repaired at 17 such conveniences. Combined Drainage. By reason of the increase of knowledge amongst the various property owners and others in the Borough, our difficulties under this head are much increased. We find that a certain class of property owner, immediately his drains are requiring attention, raises the question of sewer and endeavours to throw the responsibility for attending to such matters upon the Council; although the channel in question may be laid entirely within his private premises and may only serve his own private properties. Those who have only a slight knowledge of the various decisions of the Courts on these matters will be aware of the numerous pitfalls which have to be satisfactorily negotiated in dealing with these matters. The amount of money spent by this Council in carrying out purely private drainage work under these conditions, although in past years it may have been a merely nominal amount, is now assuming much larger proportions 63 and will undoubtedly be considerably increased from year to year unless Parliament in its wisdom brings in a bill dealing with this matter as it affects London particularly. Sewerage. Although the summer season of last year was almost continuously wet and therefore not conducive to the production of smells from the sewers, yet, on several occasions complaints were received as to offensive smells emanating from the London County Council main sewers. On two or three occasions complaints were received as to flooding with sewage arising from the surcharging of the County Council's main sewer causing a backflow along the drains of properties in lowlying districts and overflowing into such houses and premises. This is a matter of great regret as it was hoped that the provision of the new relief sewer would have effectually overcome this trouble. Refuse Removal. New ash receptacles have been provided in 266 cases,and 14 complaints on this subject have been forwarded to the Surveyor for his attention. Offensive Trade Refuse. The arrangement entered into with Messrs. Hempleman & Co., of West Ham, still continues to work very satisfactorily. Public Sanitary Conveniences. The Public Sanitary Conveniences, Urinal, Fountains and Horse Troughs situated within the Borough are the same as last year. Water Supply. The water supplied throughout the whole of the District by the Metropolitan Water Board still maintains its high standard of purity. One of the large manufacturing premises in the district having sunk a well which gives an abundant supply of water, has 64 discontinued the supply by the Metropolitan Water Board, and rely upon their own supply. A sample of this water has been analysed, the results showing it to be of a satisfactory character. During the year 147 water supply certificates have been granted under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 ; these certificates stating that the new houses to which they refer are supplied with a proper water supply in accordance with the Act. Defective water fittings have been renewed in 116 cases; 28 water supplies have been reinstated where the supply had been cut off; 18 water supplies have been altered so as to draw direct from the main ; the cleansing, repairing, and covering of cisterns has been required in 21 cases. Proceedings were commenced by the issue of a summons for having an occupied house without proper and sufficient water supply, under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in one case during the year; the summons however, was withdrawn on payment of the costs, as the water had been put on to the premises in the interval. Smoke Nuisances. Two hundred and fifty-five observations have been taken for smoke nuisances during the year, but on only seven occasions was it found necessary to issue Statutory Notices for the abatement of any nuisance which was found. Three prosecutions have been taken during the year on this account, all being against the same defendants, who were also convicted of a similar offence in the previous year. Fines amounting to £8 and costs £4 6s., were inflicted in these three cases. 65 During the year a Conference of Representatives of the various Metropolitan Boroughs and City Councils has been held at the invitation of the County Council to consider as to proposed amendments of the law dealing with smoke nuisances. It was agreed that it ought to be possible to take action for nuisances occasioned by smoke, although such smoke was not actually black in character. It was also agreed that the word chimney ought to include chimneys of Government workshops, and also the chimneys of buildings where manufacturing processes were carried on under statutory powers. It was also agreed that, in special cases of nuisance, the proceedings might be taken by the London County Council, at the request of and by agreement with the local Sanitary Authority. Food and Drugs Act. Four hundred samples have been purchased under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, of which 381 were certified to be genuine and 19 adulterated, the adulterations thus being equivalent to about 5 per cent, of the samples taken. Of the total number of samples purchased, 129 were butter, of which 2 were adulterated ; 181 were milk, of which 15 were certified to be adulterated; the remaining adulterated samples were one of separated milk, and 1 of liniment of iodine. Proceedings were taken in 15 of these cases, in two other cases proceedings were not taken because of informality in the actual taking of the sample, in one other case a cautionary letter was sent, and in the remaining case it was arranged that all of certain old stock remaining in the shop should be destroyed, 66 which was done. Proceedings were also taken in one case where Margarine was sold from a bulk supply which was itself unlabelled. These proceedings resulted in fines and costs being imposed in all cases but 5, in which cases warranties were established to the satisfaction of the Court. One other cautionary letter was sent in the case of a sample of Coffee Mixture which was purchased, the Analyst certifying that the mixture consisted of 25 per cent. Coffee and 75 per cent. Chicory. The question was considered as to whether this was not a fraudulent mixture, but in view of the fact that the paper containing the sample bore the following words, " This is sold as a mixture of Chicory and Coffee," it was thought that the letter of caution would be sufficient. Of the total number of samples, 42 were taken in course of, and at the place of delivery, by an Officer of this Council direct, of which number 11 were certified to be adulterated ; 3 were bought by an Officer of the Council direct, all of which were not adulterated ; the remaining 355 samples were taken by agents employed by the Officers of this Council and a small number of samples not included in the above were taken in an informal manner. It may be of interest to put on record here that during the year a series of samples were taken of the milk supplied to one of the Public Institutions in the Borough, when it was found that adulterated milk was being delivered. Our suspicions had been aroused in this respect for some considerable time, but we had been unable to definitely prove the matter. By adopting certain tactics however, we succeeded on obtaining a series of 7 samples, which were adulterated, and it was in connection with the taking of these samples that the two adulterated samples were 67 taken in which cases proceedings did not follow because of certain informalities in the taking thereof. It will be seen that one of these alleged that the milk was deficient in 73 per cent, of its milk fat, and also contained 17 per cent, added water. We were at considerable trouble and expense to endeavour to bring these charges home to the person actually committing the offence, the supply to the Institution being under contract, and in reference to each sample the wholesale firm gave notice of warranty, in practically every case there being a different farmer and source of supply. We brought to the Court the various farmers and their men ; the guards of the trains, and the station porters, in order to enable us to trace the course of the milk from the cow to the hands of the wholesale firm. It was surprising how slight evidence was sufficient to establish the warranty, although, on the other hand, the quality of the milk was vouched for by the different persons right up to the time when it reached the care of the wholesaler, and we were able to prove, it was in fact in one case admitted, that the milk was changed from one churn to another and other curious practices carried out concerning it. In one instance, the warranty relied upon was given by a person since deceased, and this fact, although known to the defendant, was not divulged until after much trouble, needless to say, we obtained a conviction. In the two cases connected with this warranty, although we were able to prove five previous convictions against the same defendant, relating to the milk supply to the same Institution, yet the Magistrate only imposed a fine of 40s. in these two cases, and 10s. in one other case, holding that, as the authorities of the Institution had seen fit to allow this Contractor to continue the milk supply, they had condoned his previous offences in this respect. 68 The following Statement showing the number of samples of all kinds of Food and Drugs, and the number of samples of Milk and Butter examined in 1908, by the Public Analyst of each Local Authority under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in London, is interesting :— Borough.
