August, 1962 To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the annual report on the health and sanitary circumstances in the Borough for the year 1961 The report of the Public Analyst, T. McLachlan, Esq., D.C.M. A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C. is included During the year under review there was no serious outbreak of infectious disease and the health of the inhabitants of the Borough has been satisfactory At the end of the year a fatal case of smallpox occurred in London and a Fulham resident was a very close contact. He and his family were vaccinated and kept under surveillance Fortunately he did not develop the disease A number of staff changes has again occurred. It is with regret that I have to report the deaths of Mr. R.J. Osmond, Disinfecting Superintendent, and Mr. W.E. Davies, an Enquiry Officer for Smoke Control Area Surveys, Mr. Osmond had been on the staff of the Health Department for nine years. He was an efficient officer who was held in high esteem by all his colleagues in the department and was greatly respected by the public with whom he came in contact. His death during his active career was a great loss to the Council. He was succeeded by Mr J W Smith, who was promoted from Foreman. Mr. Davies had been a loyal and conscientious member of the staff on two occasions for a total of ten years. His kind and friendly manner was a valuable asset in his contacts with members of the public and made him a respected member of the staff Mr. Davies was succeeded by Mrs. B Vane Three District Public Health Inspectors resigned during the year on obtaining appointments with other Local Authorities outside London Mr A.G. Bell, who had five and a half years service, went to Farnborough Urban District Council; Mr. C. Clayden, after five years service, went to Brighton County Borough Council: and Mr. H. Batson, after two and a half years service; went to Mansfield Borough Council All three Inspectors received their training as students at Fulham The only appointment made during the year was that of Mr. D. J. Wells, another student, who qualified in November. Advertisements for Public Health Inspectors again proved fruitless Students are virtually the only source of recruitment and during the year two more students were appointed - Mr. R.W. Southerby, who commenced in August and Mr. D.H. Franklin in September At the end of the year there were four students in the Department, three of whom will sit their qualifying examination in 1962 Mr. M. Gadsby. Junior Clerk, resigned in October to join the staff of B.O.A.C. and was replaced by Mrs. F. Andrews Clean Air During the year a total of 5,466 premises were dealt with under the No. 4 Smoke Control Area Order It is now evident that this is about the maximum number of premises which can be dealt with in any year with the available resources of staff and builders who have specialised in this work. As in previous years, a comprehensive Clean Air Exhibition was held in the locality covered by the Order This time we were fortunate in having available the spacious accommodation of Cobbs Hall, which enabled a much larger trade display to be housed and also allowed the Health Department to show exhibits of its activities in the Clean Air field, together with many examples of the damaging effects of atmospheric pollution on health and materials The Exhibition aroused great interest and was attended by more than 3,000 visitors. 5 Water Regular water sampling in the Borough has been carried out, as described in my 1960 report and close co-operation has been maintained with the Medical Officer of the Metropolitan Water Board, Dr. E. Windle Taylor. All samples taken from piped supplies have been satisfactory. Food Hygiene In my report for 1960 I drew attention to the low standard of food hygiene which is accepted generally by the populace in this Country. A further problem met with during the year was that of elderly persons who carry on food businesses when their age makes it impossible for them to maintain or understand proper standards of food hygiene. Two such cases occurred during the year and the Council was reluctantly forced to take legal proceedings against both persons. One person sold his business as a result and the other carried out improvements to his premises. Another difficulty frequently encountered is the widespread employment in the catering trade of foreign nationals, many of whom speak and understand little or no English It is most difficult, if not impossible, to convey to these persons what is meant by personal and food hygiene and one cannot but feel a certain amount of apprehension at the potential danger which must exist in such circumstances. Rodent Control The idea of co-ordination of sewer treatment by Boroughs on an interconnected sewer system put forward in last year's report has been accepted by the No. 4 Metropolitan Workable Area Committee and it is hoped that a satisfactory programme will be drawn up for future use by the Local Authorities concerned. Old People Fulham has a high proportion of elderly persons in its population and all too frequently this Department is called upon to try to assist when someone has at last broken down and find they can no longer cope with day to day activities. Many of these old persons first come to our knowledge when they are living in neglected and insanitary conditions This state of affairs does not develop overnight and one cannot help feeling that in many cases relatives, neighbours or friends must have noticed what is happening but, unfortunately, have taken no steps to try to help the unfortunate person or to try to obtain help from one or other of the organisations which would be able to assist or to advise where assistance could be obtained. Some of these cases first come to the Department's notice when other residents in the house get worried about the risk from fire due to the forget fulness or carelessness of the old person. Senile old persons with mental changes are a particularly difficult problem. They are often careless and unsociable in their habits and their standards of hygiene are often low. This ultimately leads to complaints from neighbours, frequently justifiable. They often resent and resist attempts to help them. This type of old person is not suitable for care in their own home by short regular visits from home helps and district nurses; they need constant supervision Unfortunately, neither the general nor the mental hospitals are today able to accept this type of case and there is the greatest difficulty in finding any alternative accommodation to which they can be sent. The general hospitals are reluctant to admit aged persons unless they have an acute condition which is likely to respond to treatment. Often old people are discharged from hospital without their being able to fend for themselves but they are "cured" as far as the condition for which they were admitted to hospital is concerned. The problem of the care of the aged - and especially the aged sick and those with senile mental changes needs urgent reconsideration and the provision of adequate accommodation, in which they can be cared for - if necessary indefinitely - is long overdue 6 Some old people are living with elderly relatives or elderly friends If one of these falls ill, the other is not capable of looking after the sick person and great hardship and distress can be caused for both if admission to a suitable hospital cannot be obtained. I must place on record the invaluable help which various services and organisations are giving to old people in their homes. Particularly, praise is due to the L.C.C. Home Help Service and the District Nursing Association who shoulder the brunt of the less pleasant problems which occur in this type of case The Laundry and Home Bathing Services of the Health Department also play a vital part Without all these services the problem of dealing with the old people would be insoluble. Timber - Damage by pests and fungi Special attention has been directed during the year to the very serious problem of timber damage by pests and fungi. A high proportion of the housing defects found consist of defective timberwork. Most of this trouble is due to either infestation and damage by woodworm or fungal invasion of the timber leading to dry or wet rot. Both fungal and insect attack on timber are widespread in this country and are on the increase. They cause great economic loss, estimated at many millions of pounds per year. Both conditions are preventable, yet most property owners make no effort to safeguard their premises against these most expensive pests The lack of knowledge of this problem on the part of householders and landlords does not help If both were aware of the possibility and simple causation of these conditions, serious trouble need never arise, as they would be detected and treated at an early stage. Extensive and expensive renewal of structural timbers which inevitably follows neglect of the early signs would thereby be avoided. Both these conditions are transmissible to sound timbers in other properties The adult beetles causing woodworm can fly and spread from house to house. The fungus of the wood rots spreads by direct invasion even through brick walls, or can be carried by airborne spores to other properties Woodworm is caused by a small beetle which can fly freely and lays its minute eggs in cracks in sound timber The eggs hatch in time into tiny grubs which burrow into the substance of the wood where they feed on the wood and in so doing form burrows which weaken the timber. After a period of feeding and burrowing which may continue for years the grub changes to an adult beetle and bores its way out, making the characteristic hole in the surface of the timber to enable it to escape The problem is made more serious by the fact that the first evidence that infestation has occurred is only obtained by the appearance of these flight holes in the wood surface, by which time the grub has done its damage which is invisible and the adult beetle has escaped to mate and infect other property or furniture Adequate local treatment at this stage can limit the damage but cannot prevent further re infestation. For this purpose thorough and skilled treatment of all the woodwork is necessary and this is expensive and often inconvenient. Dry rot is a fungal infection of wood This condition can only develop in timber which contains more than 20% of moisture furniture and joinery timber in this Country normally contains about 12%. The minute airborne spores of the fungus are present everywhere and any suitably damp timber is soon infected The spore germinates and the fungus spreads by a threadlike mycelium which extends throughout the timber, destroying its structure by chemical breakdown of the wood The mycelium can penetrate plaster and brickwork and if untreated will extend into adjoining properties Large sporing bodies may be formed and these contain millions of minute spores each capable of spreading the condition further afield. Here again prevention is better than cure. If only tenants and owners were alive to the dangers of dampness from minor structural defects and the widespread damage which neglect of these in the early stages may ultimately lead to. much expense and inconvenience could be avoided. 7 Many owners neglect minor repairs to roofs, water pipes, gutters, etc. even after they have been reported by their tenants and only give attention to the defect after informal or formal notices are issued by the Public Health Inspector, possibly after an interval of months. Unfortunately, during this period the damage has already been done and even if the original defect is later repaired, there is a possibility that dry rot infection has already occurred and its spread is inevitable. What was originally a minor repair costing a few shillings can end up as a very extensive job costing hundreds of pounds. In some instances the damage is so serious as to require closure and even demolition of part of the house as being dangerous to the inhabitants. Also to be considered is the inconvenience such extensive repairs cause for the tenants who may have to be temporarily re-housed to enable the extensive repair work to be carried out. Another important matter so often overlooked by owners is the need for proper and thorough treatment of both woodworm and dry rot. In the case of dry rot, it is useless merely to cut out the obviously affected timber and replace it by new. The mycelium can extend through timber which to the eye appears normal but which, nevertheless, is infected. Extensive cutting-out is needed of apparently sound timber. It is also useless to use any but a reputed brand of treatment chemical on the existing timbers to prevent further spread and any timber used for repair should have been properly treated beforehand to prevent it becoming infected. Attention must also be drawn to another possible source of infection of house timbers, namely firewood produced from second-hand timber from old buildings. This may contain either woodworm or dry rot and can be a source of infection of sound properties. In my opinion it is most important that defective timber from repair work or demolition sites be burned, preferably on site and not sold for firewood. This is a very real danger and quite recently I have seen wood blocks heavily infected with dry rot on sale for firewood in Fulham. Fortunately the salesman was most co-operative and when the danger was pointed out, the infected material was surrendered freely for destruction In an attempt to bring the problem to the notice of house owners, a letter is now sent with every notice issued by the Public Health Inspectors where timber defects are involved. A copy of this letter is included in the report at Appendix A (page ). Arrangements were also made for the Medical Officer of Health and all the Public Health Inspectors and students to attend a one-day course of instruction in the recognition and treatment of timber pests organised by one of the firms specialising in this kind of work. This was most interesting and useful. In conclusion. I have pleasure in thanking the Council and Members of the Health Committee for their continued support and interest in the work of the Department. To my Chief Officer colleagues and their staffs my medical colleagues in hospitals and general practice; the Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council. Dr. B.E.A. Sharpe and her staff; and the various local organisations with which the department collaborates, my sincere thanks are also offered, as it would be quite impossible for the department to function effectively without their help and co operation, which is always so willingly forthcoming. Finally. I wish to offer my sincere thanks to the staff of the Health Department for their loyalty and conscientious attention to their duties at all times. I have the honour to be. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant.

Its other boundaries are formed by the Boroughs of Hammersmith in the west, Chelsea in the east, and the Royal Borough of Kensington in the north. It is very flat and low lying being only 12-13 ft. above sea level. The subsoil is of flood plain gravel overlying London clay 20 to 40 ft. below. Subsoil water is rarely met within 15 ft. of the ground surface. Fulham is principally a dormitory Borough with a fringe of heavy industrial undertakings on the riverside, and is well served with open spaces and parks which have been added to by post-war development. The slum clearance and redevelopment programmes are also having the dual effect of improving the standard of housing and the appearance of the Borough. Area of Borough 1,706 acres Population (estimated mid-1961) 111,500 Separately Rated Dwellings 30,259 Rateable Value £1,965,736 Rate levied - 19s.4d. in the £ - Estimated Yield £1,851,360 A Penny Rate produces approximately £7,980 Number of assessments 34,214 Number of Marriages registered during the year 943 The Registrar General's estimate gives the mid-year population of the Borough as 111,500 - a decrease compared with 1960 of 1,460. Ten years ago, in 1951, the estimated population was 122, 400. The birth rate is 16.32 compared with 15.99 in 1960. Ten years ago the birth rate was 14.04. The infant mortality rate has decreased to 19.40 compared with 22.01 in 1960. The figure for England and Wales in 1961 is 21 25. The death rate in 1961 shows a very slight increase compared with 1960 - being 10.98 as compared with 10.89. Heart disease continues to be the main "killer", with cancer the next most important. This is dramatically shown in the diagram on page 13 where it will be seen that heart disease and cancer together account for slightly over half the total number of deaths. With an ageing population, it is likely that this proportion will increase in future years.

There were 1,548 notifications - an increase of 1,051 over 1960. Pour cases of poliomyelitis were notified. Three paralytic cases were Fulham residents; one non-paralytic case was a non-resident. Whooping Cough continues to be a relatively unimportant disease - the nation-wide vaccination against this disease having effectively reduced the liability to this very distressing and damaging complaint of infants and young children. TUBERCULOSIS (Return for Year ending 31st December, 1961) The tuberculosis death rate has remained at the same low level as last year, being 3.5 again. There has been a steady decline in the incidence and mortality of this disease since the end of the war, largely due to the introduction at that time of drugs which are effective against the tubercle bacillus. The dramatic improvement is shown by the fact that, in 1951, the tuberculosis death rate per 100,000 population was 40.0 The notification rate for tuberculosis in 1961 was 60.9 compared with 73.5 in 1960. Ten years ago. in 1951, the rate was 160.1. 17 PULMONARY NON-PULMONARY Men Women Children* Total Men Women Children* Total Notified cases on Register at 1st January 196 1 620 468 20 1,108 54 54 13 121 Add - Notifications 39 19 4 62 3 3 - 6 Transfers from other areas 38 24 62 1 2 3 Children transferred to adults 4-- 4 - - - - Deduct: - Deaths (all causes) .8 1 - 9 - - - - Left the Borough 41 28 1 70 - 2 1 3 Recovered 32 17 4 53 4 1 5 Children transferred to adults - -4 4 - - - Other reasons 10 5 1 16 - - - - Notified cases on Register at 31st December, 1961 .610 460 14 1,084 58 53 11 122 *For the purpose of this Return, children are recognised as adults upon attaining the age of 15 years T.B.

H. C. PRICE - CHEST PHYSICIAN) The Pattern of Chest Clinic Work in the Last Decade 1951 1961 Total number of Tuberculosis Cases on Clinic Register 1,163 1, 206 Number of new cases notified 131 68 Number of deaths 52 9 Total attendances 6,725 7,876 Total number of patients x-rayed 2, 548 4,141 Number of tuberculous patients on domiciliary treatment 57 Nil Number of patients on T.B. hospital waiting list 40 Nil The above table shows the trend in tuberculosis and general chest clinic work that has occurred in the last decade. During this period, the back of the tuberculosis problem has been broken and the extent of the non tuberculous chest disease, bronchiectasis, bronchitis and carcinoma of the lung has been exposed. The fall in the incidence 68 (83 in 1960) and the deaths 9 (17 in 1960) from tuberculosis has continued, and again this year there are no deaths from non-pulmonary tuberculosis. The number of new patients referred with non-tuberculous chest disease continues to rise - for new cases from 274 to 303, and the slight fall in the attendances for the tuberculous patient from 2,102 to 1,999 is more than compensated for by the increased attendance from bronchitic patients, 1,767 to 2,153, so that there is a rise in the total clinic attendances from 7,688 to 7,876 and the number of x-ray films taken rose from 3,701 to 4,141. The number of domiciliary visits by the Chest Physician was almost unchanged at 70 (71 in 1960) and were entirely made to bronchitic patients during their acute attacks in the winter months. 18 After Care After Care problems covered a wide field. Close liaison with the Divisional Health Offices and National Assistance Board enabled patients to be provided with free, or near free, extra nourishment, recuperative holidays and domestic help. Many applications were made to the London County Council and Borough Housing Departments, and a few families were rehoused. Poor housing still constitutes the largest single problem the After Care Department must face, for it brings many other difficulties in its wake. Marital troubles, children's behaviour problems, depression, anxiety and actual physical set back in health seemed more often than not to be largely caused by poor and inadequate housing conditions. Re-settlement Clinics continued to be held once a month. These are held at the Chest Clinic and attended by the Ministry of Labour Disablement Re-settlement Officer, the Chest Physician, the Care Organiser and each individual patient requiring help in his problems of return to working life. Patients continued to do Diversional Therapy work at home and at Hurlingham Lodge, and the Pottery Classes continued to meet twice weekly. The Fulham Tuberculosis Care Committee was able to give financial aid on 62 occasions to clinic patients. Help of this kind included fares, holidays, clothing, removals and many other emergencies. Forty patients received special Christmas gifts. Deaths due to Respiratory Disease in Fulham The winter of 1960/61 was similar to the previous winter, in that it was mild, but, in spite of this, there was a continued rise in the mortality from bronchitis in both sexes.

Most of the emphasis centres on the relationship between smoking and the development in later life of carcinoma of the bronchus. The increased incidence of bronchitis, coronary thrombosis, gastric disorders and the break down of tuberculosis lesions in the 45- age group in male smokers in mainly ignored, these latter conditions being a much greater medico social problem and carrying a greater mortality rate than cancer of the bronchus. The measure taken to combat atmospheric pollution, inadequate as they are in the light of present scientific knowledge, will have little effect on the incidence of coronary disease and gastric and duodenal disorders. 19 Physiotherapy and Breathing Exercises Sessions for graduated breathing exercises and postural drainage of the bronchi have continued throughout the year, though somewhat spasmodically, owing to the chronically bad staff conditions which is mainly due to the poor salary and conditions of service that apply to all medical ancillary staff. The New In-patient Chest Unit This year the old tuberculosis wards at the Western Hospital have at long last (fourteen years) been largely reconditioned, cubicalised and one ward air-conditioned. It was only after considerable difficulty and the employment of agency nursing staff that the wards finally reopened, after completion of the building work. Thus, for the first time, the correct treatment of the patient with acute bronchitis can be carried out in Fulham in correct atmospheric conditions, even in foggy weather. This costly undertaking worked very well during its first winter in operation, and the most noticeable feature was the absence of weather effects on the bronchitic patients in the air conditioned section. Unfortunately, the Minister's plan, under the new white paper intends that these wards shall be swept away, and it would appear very unlikely that they will be rebuilt in this form elsewhere in Fulham NEW NOTIFICATIONS IN AGE GROUPS Years Males Females Under 1 year 1 - 1 - 5 - 2 6-15 - 2 16 - 25 8 4 26 - 35 6 6 36 - 45 4 4 46-55 10 4 56 - 65 9 2 Over 65 5 1 43 25 Total 68 COMPARATIVE SUMMARY OF STATISTICS FOR ANNUAL REPORT, 1961 Number of New Patients attending 1961 Non-Tuberculous Chest Cases 303 ( 274) Contacts 129 ( 147) New notifications transferred in 65 ( 63) Number of Clinic Attendances Notified Cases of Tuberculosis 1,999 (2, 102) Contacts of Cases of Tuberculosis 3,724 (3,819) Other Chest Cases 2,153 (1,767) 7,876 (7,688) Number of New Notifications of Tuberculosis in Fulham Pulmonary 62 ( 71) Non-Pulmonary 6 ( 12) Number of Deaths in Fulham Pulmonary Tuberculosis 9 ( 17) Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis Nil (Nil) Bronchitis 99 ( 81) Cancer of the Lung 95 ( 95) 20 Number taken off the Tuberculosis Register as Cured Pulmonary 53 ( 48) Non-Pulmonary 5 ( 7) Number of Visits by Chest Physician 70 ( 71) Number of Visits by Health Visitors 2, 593 (2,862) Number of patients x-rayed 4,141 (3,701) Number of patients undergoing treatment at home Nil ( 7) Number of B.

P A NASH MEDICAL DIRECTOR) The Mass X Ray Centre at Western Hospital, Seagrave Road. Fulham, from which the South West London Mass X-Ray Service operates three mobile Chest X-Ray Units, continued to provide a regular one day a week service for the public. This Centre is open to everyone over the age of fifteen, regardless of where they work and/or live, and people from all parts of South West London attend there, including a great number from the borough of Fulham, In addition to private individuals, who can come without previous appointment any time between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., and 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Wednesdays, many patients are referred there by general practitioners in Fulham; and employees of local firms and organisations attend by arrangement of the Managements concerned, In 1961 14,133 persons were x-rayed at this Centre, of whom 5,366 were sent by their own doctors. Figures relating to cases discovered are not kept separately for this Centre, or for those attending from the borough of Fulham. but it may be of interest to note that the last available figures (which are for 1960). show that of the 98,570 people examined by the South West London Mass X-Ray Units that year, the incidence of active pulmonary tuberculosis found was 92 per 1,000 in members of the general public, 1.01 in Industrial Groups, and 6.09 in patients referred by general practitioners. In all groups combined, the rate per thousand was men: 1.94, women: 1.63, giving an overall rate of 1.83, This Centre also provides a special Large Film Service for patients sent by the Ante Natal Clinics in the borough: and arrangements are made through the Divisional Medical Officer for parties of schoolchildren, who are positive reactors to tuberculin skin tests, given in connection with the London County Council B.C.G. Inoculation scheme, to be brought here to be x-rayed. The mobile Unit made nine visits to firms and organisations in Fulham, as a result of which 2,093 employees were x-rayed and three cases referred to Chest Clinics. In January a Mass X-Ray Unit was at St. James Church Hall, Moore Park Road, where in response to a house to house delivery of leaflets. 263 residents in the vicinity came for x-ray, This was followed by a similar three day visit to the Munster Park Methodist Church Hall Chesilton Road, where the local Girl Guide and Boy Scout Troops gave valuable assistance with the distribution of leaflets, and 322 people were x-rayed. A third visit was made in February, to St. Andrews Church Hall, May Street, West Kensington, for two days, as a result of which over 400 attended for x-ray. Nine Fulham firms and organisations are now co-operating in the South London six monthly chest x ray service, by allowing their male employees over forty five years of age, to attend the Mobile Unit which visits their premises twice a year. This service, which was started in 1958, in an attempt to afford some protection against the hazards of lung cancer, is now x raying regularly over seventeen thousand men. It is used by many men in the older age groups who live in Fulham. a considerable number of whom receive appointments to attend every six months at the Western Hospital Mass X-Ray Centre. Any man over 45 who wishes to be included in this service can obtain a leaflet, and all particulars, on application to the South West London Mass X-Ray Service, or by attending the Mass X Ray Centre on any Wednesday during the times stated above. 21 Although the number of deaths from tuberculosis continues to fall, the latest published figures show that 20,799 new cases of tuberculosis were notified in England and Wales in 1960, and the South West London Mass X Ray Units again take this opportunity of inviting all citizens in the Borough to make full use of the Service, to safeguard the health of themselves, their families, and those with whom they work. FOOD POISONING During the year twenty single cases were notified and in sixteen of these the causative agent was identified as follows:- Agent Identified No. of Cases Salmonella Typhi-murium 14 Salmonella Berta 1 Salmonella Agama 1 Children of school age are referred to local L.C C. School Treatment Centres. AUTHENTICATION OF VACCINATION AND INOCULATION CERTIFICATES In several parts of the world certificates of vaccination and/or inoculations are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a Medical Officer in the Government or Municipal Service of the country of issue The form of authentication which appears to be most readily accepted by Health Authorities abroad is that given by Public Health Authorities, whereby practitioners signatures are verified by the Medical Officer of Health. The Minister of Health therefore has asked Local Authorities to make arrangements under which any person who desires to have a certificate of vaccination or inoculation far the purpose of travel abroad may have it stamped accordingly at the office of the Health Department. The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those Health Authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Authenticators are not required to certify that the vaccination or inoculation has been properly carried out or, indeed, that it has been carried out at all; the responsibility for issuing the certificate remains with the doctor signing it This does not imply any suggestion that a certificate of vaccination or inoculation issued by a registered Medical Practitioner requires any official supervision or control in order to be of adequate medical value Authentication is not a requirement of Her Majesty's Government but the proposal is designed as a remedy for difficulties which have in practice been met by persons from this country travelling abroad During the year a total of 592 certificates of vaccination and/or inoculation were authenticated BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The following bacteriological examinations were carried out for the Council on specimens submitted by general practitioners and the Public Health Department during the year:— Nose and Throat swabs 67 Faeces 216 Urine 5 Miscellaneous 24 Number of treatments carried out during the year:— Adults 42 Children (under 5 years) 2 SCABIES AND ALLIED CONDITIONS (Treatment Centre - Disinfecting Station, Townmead Road) The Centre which was established in January 1957, is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1.30 to 4.30 p.m. During the time of bathing the clothing is heat treated and is ready to wear afterwards. The work of bathing men is undertaken by the existing staff under the supervision of the Superintendent, and the bathing of women and children by a part-time female bathing attendant. Medical practitioners are notified after treatment has been carried out. 22 Section C Personal Services Page Hospitals and other Centres in the Borough 23 L.C.C.

C. P. THATCHER, LL. B , HONORARY SECRETARY FULHAM OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE) The Fulham Old People's Welfare Committee is a co-ordinating and advisory body set up for the furtherance of old people's welfare in the Borough of Fulham. It is a voluntary organisation which has as its members representatives of authorities and organisations concerned with the welfare of the aged It derives its income mainly from grants from the Borough Council The following activities in this field have been selected as being of general interest Grant from Borough Council The grant from the Fulham Borough Council for the year 1961/62 was £3,250, representing an increase of approximately £800 over the previous year. The increase was mainly to meet the additional cost of the meals services Meals on Wheels and Luncheon Clubs The meals on wheels service, which is undertaken by the Women's Voluntary Service, enables two course hot mid-day meals to be delivered to the homes of house-bound or infirm old people in the Borough Each meal costs the Committee 2s. 6d., of which 10d. is paid by the recipient, 1s. by the London County Council, and the balance of 8d. is borne by the Committee An application has been made by the Committee to the London County Council for an increase in their 1s subvention and this is still under consideration. The Council has approved the purchase of a new van more suited to the Committee's requirements, and it is expected that this will go into service in the Spring of 1962. There is still a popular demand for mid day meals at club premises and the four luncheon clubs in the Borough which are run by voluntary organisations, have continued their useful work throughout the year The charge to the old people is 10d. per meal (as for meals on wheels). The number of meals supplied during the year ending 31st March, 1962, are summarised on the attached statement. Invalid Meals Service This service which has been in operation for some years, enables invalids needing special diets to have mid day meals delivered to their homes. The meals are prepared at a kitchen in Munster Road and are taken to the homes of patients by mobile meals vans fitted with special containers to keep the meals hot whilst in transit. Some 550 meals a week are delivered in this way 500 to Fulham patients and 50 to patients in neighbouring boroughs Most of the recipients are elderly people and although the cost of each meal is approximately 5s., the patient's contribution is only 1s. 4d. New patients are not accepted for the scheme unless their applications are supported by medical evidence of need The demand for the service during the past year has been very heavy and there is now a waiting list The London County Council are at present responsible for invalid meals, but new powers are now available to enable Metropolitan Borough Councils to administer the service if they wish to do so Fulham Borough Council has expressed the desire to exercise these new powers and invalid meals will no doubt become a Borough Council service before long Social Clubs The 13 social clubs in the Borough all of which are run by voluntary organisations, have been well supported during the year They offer companionship to those who are lonely and the atmosphere of their weekly meetings is always convivial They arrange their own entertainment, annual outings and Christmas activities towards the cost of which the Old People's Welfare Committee, in appropriate cases, makes a grant 27 Chiropody The Committee has continued to supplement the work of the London County Council Foot Clinics by providing chiropody at the following two clinics at the times indicated:- British Red Cross Society, 52, New King's Road. Fulham, S W.6. Tuesday: 9. 0 a.m. to 1. 0 p.m. 2. 0 p.m. to 4 0 p.m. Bishop Creighton House, 378, Lillie Road. Fulham, S.W.6 Tuesday: 10.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. 1.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. The number of treatments provided during the period 1st January. 1961 to 31st December. 1961 were as follows:- British Red Cross Society 748 Bishop Creighton House 553 During the latter part of the year the rapid rise in the number of calls made upon the domiciliary service, and consequently the cost, has been a matter of some concern. The number of visits made rose from 241 in 1960 to 474 in 1961. No doubt increased publicity on the work of the Committee accounted for this, and it would seem that some limit might have to be placed upon the number of visits made each month to keep the expenditure within reasonable limits. The London County Council, who are responsible for the cost of all chiropody, have indicated that they will not meet the cost of any extension of chiropody services which has not had their prior approval A strong case has been put to the London County Council, however, for an increase in the grant for domiciliary chiropody, particularly as the County Council do not themselves operate such a service. Holiday Scheme This scheme enables any resident of Fulham who is over the age of 60 years and in reasonable health to enjoy a holiday at a good class boarding house at Broadstairs at very reasonable terms during the early and late summer period. During the 1961 season 257 pensioners participated as compared with 253 in the previous year. The charges and periods chosen were as follows:- Period Charge per Week Return Fare 19th May to 2nd June £4 0s. 0d. 15s. 0d. 9th September to 23rd September £4 0s. 0d. 15s. 0d. Holiday parties, escorted by volunteers from the Women's Voluntary Service and St. John Ambulance Association, travelled from Fulham Town Hall direct to boarding houses in Broadstairs. As in past years, the Broadstairs Council made several concessions to the holiday parties, including the free use of deck chairs and reduced rates of admission to entertainments. Christmas Parcels Scheme A generous donation by His Worship the Mayor, Councillor J. H. Clark, J.P., from the Mayor's Charity Fund made it possible last Christmas, to. distribute 346 parcels valued at £1 each to elderly Fulham residents living alone. The names were selected from lists submitted by local organisations and churches, and the parcels were delivered by Fulham boy scouts. Apart from the Committee's own scheme, several organisations had their own Christmas parcels' schemes and they kindly co-operated with the Town Hall in the compilation of lists of names and addresses to avoid duplication. All old people who attended luncheon clubs in the Borough during Christmas week, and all recipients of meals on wheels during that week were given a Christmas dinner provided free by the caterer, Mr. R. F. Cook, who has made this annual contribution to old people's welfare for some years. A local cinema co-operated in the Christmas activities by appealing to its patrons for gifts of groceries. Although the result of this appeal was disappointing, a further ten parcels were made up from this source. 28 Home Decoration Scheme Several visits to Fulham were made during the year by working parties from the International Voluntary Service. This organisation arranges for parties of volunteers to brighten the homes of deserving old people by redecorating their rooms in cases where the old person concerned has no other means of having the work done. The work was carried out at week-ends when the parties were accommodated at the Lytton Estate Club Room and at Bishop Creighton House. No charge is made to the pensioners and the International Voluntary Service receive no payment for the labour. The Committee has in each case, however, reimbursed them with the cost of the materials used.

C. Gerred, M.N A. B. S., M I.Mar.E., that 3040 persons a week take advantage of these facilities Home Bathing This service was commenced in April, 1954. It has proved immensely popular and not unduly costly. Number of baths given during 1961 2,988 Number of persons receiving baths at end of year 120 Number of persons on waiting list at end of year 5 At the end of the year there were four part-time female attendants engaged on this work paid on a sessional basis. It is not easy to recruit suitable ladies for this work. They need to be physically strong, patient, kind and gentle and imbued with a desire to be of service to old people. Authority exists to increase the number employed as and when there is an increased demand for the service 29 S.O.S. CARD SCHEME The SOS. Card Scheme was started in August, 1953, with the object of getting help quickly to elderly people in emergency. Total cards issued since scheme started 139 Total cards issued during 1961 12 OLD PEOPLE'S LAUNDRY (Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936) Service for Incontinent Persons This scheme which provides for the cleansing of linen and bedding of aged, infirm and incontinent persons has now been in operation for ten years. It is of very great benefit, both to the persons themselves and to the relatives or other persons who are looking after them. The work is carried out at the Disinfecting Station where modern equipment enables the staff to deal quickly and efficiently with the work. During 1961 there was a great increase in the volume of work (30 per cent) but although some overtime proved necessary I am pleased to say that it has been possible, so far, to meet every request made for this service. By arrangement with Chelsea Borough Council the laundry of their old people is dealt with at the Station. During the year 1,896 lbs. (dry weight) of laundry was cleansed. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47 and NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Visiting of old people whose circumstances require assessment under the above Acts is carried out by the Public Health Department. No compulsory removals were found necessary under either Act. Departmental Records of Old People It is estimated that there must be about 15,000 persons over 65 years of age in Fulham. Fortunately, the majority are able to look after themselves, or have friends or relatives to look after them. The details of old persons as they become known are recorded in the Department and the number, although fluctuating is generally on the increase:- The details of old persons as they become known are recorded in the Department and the number, although fluctuating is generally on the increase:- Number of new cases investigated in 1961 316 Number of above recorded for supervision in 1961 180 Number of deaths recorded in 1961 69 Number of old people admitted to Hospitals, Homes and Institutions permanently 54 Number of cases referred to other Authorities and Organisations, or Miscellaneous 2 Number left District 8 Hospital liaison visits 100 Re-visits 1,195 Total number of cases under supervision at end of year 531 Total number of cases recorded in Department 1,748 The following 25,766 articles of Fulham residents were cleansed during the year: Sheets 9,697 Pillow Cases 2,157 Towels 3,385 Underwear 7,148 Mattress Covers 264 "Pieces" 2289 Blankets 826 The New Empress State Building A dramatic aerial view of this building which has been built on the site of the old Empress Hall.

The year started with three vacancies, whilst during the year three other officers resigned to take up appointments outside London. These three had received their training in Fulham. In November one of the Council's students qualified and became the only appointment during the year, advertisements for qualified staff proving completely abortive. At the end of the year there were four students in the department, three of whom will be taking the qualifying examination during 1962 Every attempt was made to deploy the staff to the maximum advantage, but inevitably many important routine inspections could not be undertaken Water Sampling The regular monthly sampling for bacteriological examination of domestic supplies in different parts of the borough, inaugurated last year, continued. During the year 89 samples were taken, all being found satisfactory and free from Presumptive B. Coli. The following information has been kindly supplied by Dr. E. Windle Taylor. M.A., M.D., D.P.H., M.r.C.S., L.r.C.P., Director of Water Examination to the Metropolitan Water Board:- Source of Supply Number of SampIes after treatment Agar plate count per ml.

Results of Swimming Bath Water Samples During the year 21 samples of swimming bath water were taken from public and private baths, every sample being reported free from B. Coli. Bacterial counts were all satisfactory except in two cases where more than 300 per m. 1. were found. Visits were paid and follow up samples taken which proved satisfactory PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS (INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY COURTESY OP MR. R. C. GERRED, M. N. A. B. S., M.I. Mar. E., BATHS MANAGER) The Fulham Public Baths establishment comprises 3 swimming baths, 90 personal washing baths and 2 Public Laundries. The swimming baths are respectively 75' x 25' - 100' x 30' - 125' x 35'. They are filled from the Metropolitan Water Board mains, and from then on are purified by continuous pressure filtration, with a 4 hour turnover. Chlorine is used as a sterilising agent, and bacteriological tests are made regularly. These show a high standard of purity commensurate with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health Once a year all baths are emptied for thorough cleaning. During the winter season, one of the swimming baths is closed and floored over, being used for indoor bowls, table tennis, meetings, dances, etc. Two swimming pools remain open all the year The facilities in both the private warm baths, which includes showers, foam baths etc., and the Public Laundries, one of which is now fully automatic, prove very popular and are used to capacity particularly at the week ends. 32 Visits to Dwellings by Public Health Inspectors After complaint 1,275 After infectious disease 69 House to House inspections 13 Re-inspections (generally) ,747 Drains tested 705 Drains inspected 1,512 Voluntary drainage works supervised 2,393 Housing enquiries 46 Owners/Builders etc 764 Clearance Areas 51 Underground rooms 204 Certificates of Disrepair 70 Lighting of Communal Staircases 110 Vermin checks (impending rehousing) 523 Overcrowding 17 Water Sampling 90 Miscellaneous visits 543 Ineffectual visits 2,168 *Rodent control 602 (*Additional to visits by rodent operatives separately reported on page 37) Statutory Action Public Health (London) Act, 1936 and London County Council (General Powers) Acts Intimation notices served 580 Intimation notices complied with 494 Statutory Notices served 204 Statutory Notices complied with 192 Summary of Works carried out under supervision of Public Health Inspectors Fresh Air Inlets repaired or renewed 13 Soil and Vent Pipes repaired or renewed 33 Drains cleared 130 Drains repaired 54 Drains relaid 21 Rainwater gutters and pipes repaired or renewed 167 Traps cleansed, repaired, etc. 10 Pans renewed 41 Seats repaired or renewed 9 Flushing cisterns repaired or renewed 61 Fastenings provided to doors, and doors repaired 2 Sinks provided, repaired or renewed 13 Sink and bath wastes repaired or renewed 45 New baths fitted 1 Drinking water cisterns cleansed, etc. 6 Water supply pipes and fitting repaired 18 Internal house repairs 870 Fireplaces repaired (nuisances from smoke etc.) 43 Kitchen ranges repaired or renewed (for cooking purposes) 7 Dampness remedied 534 Rooms provided with adequate light and ventilation 2 Staircases provided with light and ventilation and repaired 31 Ventilation provided under floors and repairs 105 Roofs repaired 329 Other external repairs 275 Accumulations of refuse removed 11 Dustbins replaced 89 Yards, forecourts paved and drained 26 33 Legal Proceedings During the year 16 summonses were heard at the Park Petty Sessional Division in respect of outstanding nuisances under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936.

Works in Default (a) Public Health (London) Act, 1936 During 1961 the Council's contractors carried out works in default at 11 premises, the owners having failed to comply with Statutory Notices served under the Public Health (London) Act. 1936- The costs of the work varied in individual cases from 15s 3d. to £138 5s Od., the total sum involved being £334 1s. 3d (b) Housing Act, 1957 Works in default were carried out at two premises, the owners having failed to comply with Section 9 notices The costs involved were £45 0s 0d and £146 14s. 0d LAND CHARGES ACT, 1925 Enquiries as to any outstanding sanitary or other notices and orders of charges were dealt with in respect of 2,361 premises In 69 cases notices were outstanding at the time of search, and these were declared accordingly. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS The number of registered hairdressers and barbers increased during the year to 98. 42 inspections were made and no statutory action was found necessary. NOISE NUISANCES The following table sets out the various noise nuisances alleged and action taken following investigations: Nature of complaint Action taken (if any) 1 Noise from addressograph machine on first floor used at irregular hours.

DISINFECTION, DISINFESTATION AND LAUNDRY SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936 The following details relate to the services provided by the Disinfecting Superintendent and his staff during 1961:- Nuraber of rooms disinfested 514 Number of rooms disinfected after Infectious Disease 13 (10 rooms of a disused chest clinic prior to converting to housing accommodation; 3 rooms at express request of tenants) Number of wards and rooms disinfected in Maternity Hospital 10 Number of articles stoved 5,096 Laundry carried out for the Refuse Destructor staff:- Bath towels 1, 049 Roller towels 81 Dust Coats 17 The disinfecting staff have also dealt with infestation from cockroaches, beetles, ants, silver fish, moths, wasps, etc. 35 List of verminous and/or stained articles destroyed during 1961:- Bedsteads and Bedsprings 1 Mattresses 22 Beds 1 Bolsters 2 Pillows 6 Eiderdowns 3 Blankets 2 Linoleum pieces 4 Cushions 3 Travelling bags 3 Divans 1 Carpets 2 Clothing 28 RECONSTRUCTION OF REFUSE DESTRUCTOR - CESSATION OF STEAM SUPPLIES TO DISINFECTING STATION During the summer the reconstruction of the Refuse Destructor commenced which meant it was no longer possible for steam to be supplied to the Disinfecting Station as before. It was decided that the most suitable alternative method of raising steam was to hire a vertical coke-fired cross tube boiler and for one of the Disinfecting Station staff to act as stoker. This arrangement has proved satisfactory and it is anticipated it will have to continue until the autumn of 1962 when the Destructor should be able to recommence supplying steam to the Station. HOUSING ACT, 1957 DEMOLITION AND CLOSING ORDERS One demolition order was made during the year, as under:- Premises Date of Order 46- Holyport Road 25,10.1961 Three closing orders were made in respect of whole houses, as follows:- Premises Date of Order 67, Waterford Road 22 2.1961 13, Everington Street 22. 2.1961 1, Field Road 22. 2.1961 Pour closing orders were made in respect of parts of buildings, as follows:- Premises Part Closed Date of Order 20, Margravine Road First Floor and Top Floor Rooms 22 2.1961 2, Comeragh Road Basement Rooms 15. 6.1961 102, Waterford Road Basement Front Room 2. 8.1961 20, Archel Road Basement Back Room.

In one case the Public Health Committee decided to take no further action, and the other two cases have since been resolved. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS (HOUSING ACTS, 1949-1957) I am indebted to the Borough Architect and Director of Housing, Mr. E. A. H. MacDonald, A R. I.B. A., P.I Hsg , for the following particulars applicable to 1961:- Applications Received Applications dealt with Discretionary grants 42 38 Standard grants 97 68 In each case the Public Health Department is given an opportunity to check whether proposals comply with statutory and byelaw requirements. SLUM CLEARANCE PROGRAMMES Whilst no Clearance Orders were made during 1961 in implementing their joint programme, a number of inspections were made and preliminary steps taken by officers of the London County Council and the Council. RENT ACT, 1957 The administration regarding questions of certificates of disrepair under this Act continued to work smoothly. The examination of documents and giving of advice was undertaken in the Town Clerk's Department, whilst inspections, preparations of forms and correspondence were carried out by the Public Health Department staff. When visiting premises it was often found that nuisances under the Public Health (London) Act, existed, sometimes, but by no means always included in the tenant's notice (Form G). Independent statutory action was taken to secure abatement of nuisances, whether or not so included. During the year no certificate of disrepair issued by the Council was challenged by any owner or occupier in the County Court. There are still 91 certificates issued under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act. 1954, uncancelled, 3 being cancelled during 1961. 93 Certificates under the 1957 Act were outstanding at the end of the year. Details of action taken between 1st January and 31st December, 1961, are as follows:- Applications for certificates 20 Decisions not to issue certificates Nil Decisions to issue certificates 19 (a) in respect of some but not all defects 12 (b) in respect of all defects 7 Undertakings given by landlords 12 Undertakings refused by Council Nil Certificates issued 6 Applications by landlords to Council for cancellation of certificates 13 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 5 Council decisions to cancel in spite of tenants' objections 1 Certificates cancelled 7 37 HABITATION CERTIFICATES UNDER SECTION 95(2) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936 During the year 42 certificates were issued in respect of 70 newly erected dwellings in the Borough REHOUSING OF FULHAM RESIDENTS Hie situation in relation to the rehousing of Fulham residents remains substantially the same as last year, with priority being given to families displaced from slum clearance and compulsory purchase areas Number of families rehoused by London County Council 28 Number of families rehoused by Fulham Borough Council 315 Total 343 DWELLINGS COMPLETED BY THE COUNCIL BETWEEN 1st JANUARY AND 31st DECEMBER 1961 Information supplied by the courtesy of the Borough Architect and Director of Housing, Mr. E.

During the year the following drainage schemes were approved by the Public Health Committee* Additions to existing buildings or additional sanitary accommodation 78 Reconstruction of drainage system 2 Conversion of premises into flats 47 New buildings 22 Total 149 RODENT CONTROL The following is a summary of the work carried out by the Rodent Operatives during the year:- 38  Type of Property Total Local Authori ty Dwelling Houses Business & Industrial Premises 1.

No. of visits made by Rodent Operatives — 6, 102 704 6,806 The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 places responsibility upon the occupier of land or premises to notify the Local Authority of the presence of rats or mice on those premises. The Local Authority is empowered, through its officers, to inspect and prescribe the necessary treatments and, if necessary, to order structural work to rid the premises of rodents and to prevent reinfestation. In addition to the investigation of notifications of the presence of rodents, premises are inspected periodically for the purpose of discovering infestations and to supervise the carrying out of proper treatment. The Council provides a free baiting treatment for private dwellings but charges for treatments carried out to business premises. A staff of three trained rodent operatives is employed under the supervision of a Senior Public Health Inspector Since 1946, for Rodent Control purposes, the Metropolitan Area has been divided into four Areas. Fulham is in No. 4 Area, together with the Boroughs of Hammersmith, Chelsea, Kensington, Westminster, Paddington, St. Pancras, St. Marylebone and Hampstead. A Committee composed of officers in charge of rodent control from each of these Authorities meets twice a year to discuss new methods of treatment and problems of rodent control. Fulham has again been honoured this year by the re-appointment of the Senior Public Health Inspector, Mr. F E. Walsh, as Chairman of the Area Committee. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a Rodent Control Research Division which keeps Local Authorities advised of new techniques and poisons. On the advice of this Research Division, during the past year we have continued to use a new poison - sodium fluoracetate - for sewer treatment. Results so far appear to indicate that a reduction of the rat population in the sewers has followed, as there are fewer surface infestations following these treatments. In 1961 four treatments of the sewers using sodium fluoracetate. with a test baiting, without any poison, between the third and fourth treatments were undertaken. Most cases of infestations of rats in dwellings in Fulham are traceable to defects in the drainage system, thus allowing rats from the sewers to enter the houses. In such cases the owner is called upon to repair the drainage system and further infestation is thus prevented. The total number of complaints received from residential, business and industrial premises was 648. 39 CLEAN AIR ACT, 19 56 - SMOKE CONTROL AREAS (a) Revision of Programme Although the completion date of the programme remained unchanged, 1965 two modifications were made at the annual review in February. They were:- (i) to extend No. 5 Area by the addition of 28 acres, thus including Lillie Road Recreation Ground and the Cemetery. Fulham Palace Road and (ii) to create an additional small area of 47 acres (No. 6) to be dealt with concurrently with No. 5. The principal effect of both these changes was to add comparatively large areas for very few dwellings and by so doing, to give a better balance between acreage and dwellings in the three areas (Nos 7, 8 and 9) still remaining to be dealt with. A map of the Smoke Control Area is shown as the frontispiece. (b) Progress made by Metropolitan Boroughs Hie Metropolitan Boroughs" Standing Joint Committee has produced a table showing the progress made up to November, 1961, by the London Boroughs and it was very gratifying to note that Fulham had the highest number of premises subject to Smoke Control Orders in force, viz 17,960.

The procedure followed the now established pattern in accordance with the policy of the Council to inform every householder in the area of the reasons for the Smoke Control Order and of their responsibilities to avoid contraventions of the Order. The action taken was as follows:- (1) Following confirmation of the Order by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government on 12th January, 1961, all householders were sent a letter telling them of the action to take to obtain grant aid towards the cost of any necessary conversions or adaptations of their fireplaces. (2) Estate Agents, coal merchants, local builders, the North Thames Gas Board and the London Electricity Board were informed at the same time, and their attention drawn to the particular aspects of the Order with which they were most concerned. (3) The three local papers gave publicity to the confirmation of the Order and advertised the exhibition. In July the papers also published an article entitled "Clean Air For You", which incorporated a list of streets subject to the No. 4 Smoke Control Order. (4) Clean Air Exhibition, Cobb's Hall - 19th, 20th and 21st January Invitations to this exhibition were sent with the householders' letter and a total of 2,180 persons attended, an average of 78 per hour which was considered to be very satisfactory In addition, 64 persons were present at an "Any Questions" session on the 20th January, when questions were answered by a panel consisting of the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, The Medical Officer of Health, the Clean Air Officer and representatives of the North Thames Gas Board, the London Electricity Board and the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation. The principal exhibitors were:- The London Electricity Board, the North Thames Gas Board. Oil Appliance Manufacturers' Association, the National Society for Clean Air, the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation and the Fulham Borough Council. A back-projection film unit was hired and "Guilty Chimneys" and "Window to the Sky" were screened continuously A photograph of part of the exhibition is reproduced on one of the centre pages. (5) Window Display This was used at Messrs Wills & Son and Oliver Toms shops in Fulham Palace Road, and detailed the action to be taken and showed a map of the area and the streets affected by the Order 41 (6) Reminder Leaflet This was distributed to householders by hand in the week ending 22nd July, 1961 It reminded people that time was getting short and after the 1st October. 1961 it would be an offence to emit smoke from their chimneys, therefore conversions should be completed by this date. (7) Mobile exhibition vans Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, North Thames Gas Board and London Electricity Board All these visited the area between January and October. The Department co-operated with the Solid Snokeless Fuels Federation on their visit, from the 28th August to the 2nd September, during which 505 people visited the van. (f) Fulham Borough Council (Variation of No. 4) Smoke Control Order, 1961 After the Smoke Control Order for No 4 Area was made it became known that certain premises in the Chancellors Road area would be demolished by the London County Council in order to form an open space and it was, therefore necessary to exclude these properties from the requirements of the Smoke Control Order The only way to do this was to make a Variation Order dated the 19th July This Order has since been confirmed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government who fixed the operative date of the Order as the 1st May. 1962 MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT CIRCULAR NO 1/61 Notification of provisional plans for establishing Smoke Control Areas This Circular dated 16.1.61 reviewed the procedure for establishing areas and stated that in future all local authorities in "black" areas would not be required to submit provisional proposals before making Smoke Control Orders The whole of London is a "black" area and the simplification of the procedure has been most welcome MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT CIRCULAR NO 31/61 Works of Adaptat ion eligible for Grant The effect of this circular was to authorise approval to grant for electric firelighters providing that in any particular case the total alternative costs between gas and electrical ignition were broadly comparable It was agreed that the expression "broadly comparable" should be interpreted as not exceeding the difference of £1 0s 0d between the cost of the two methods and that proof of purchase of firelighters should be provided before ancillary work (wiring and points) was commenced These decisions were taken in September but by the end of the year only one application had been approved and paid. "Leo-Fi" Oil Heaters This heater is the first oil burning appliance to be approved for grant. It was decided that grants in respect of these heaters should be based on the full cost only if the costs of alternative methods (i e electric or gas appliances) were comparable. In other cases the grants to be based on the more expensive of the alternative methods WEST LONDON INTER BOROUGHS SMOKE CONTROL LIAISON COMMITTEE Three meetings of this Committee were held during the year for the purpose of exchanging views and advice on common problems arising from the creation of Staoke Control Areas The following Local Authorities are members of this Committee:- Acton Borough Council Hammersmith Metropolitan Borough Council Barnes Borough Council Richmond Borough Council Brentford and Chiswick Borough Council Willesden Borough Council Fulham Metropolitan Borough Council 42 Measurement of Air Pollution TABLE OF RESULTS OF RECORDINGS AND ANALYSES Month Site Rainfall (in inches) Insoluble Deposit SolubIe Deposit Total Solids Mg. of SO3/Day collected by 100 cq. cm. of Batch "A" Lead Peroxide (Tons per Sq.

Air is drawn by means of a pump, first through a filter paper then through a drechsel bottle and finally a meter. The filter paper removes the smoke, leaving a discoloured patch on the paper. The drechsel bottle contains a weak solution of hydrogen peroxide which reacts with the sulphur dioxide to form a sulphuric acid and the meter measures the volume of air passing through the apparatus in a known time. The density of the smoke stain is proportional to the amount of smoke in the air and can be measured by means of a photo-electric reflection densitometer The sulphur dioxide is estimated by a simple chemical titration. From tables provided by the Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research at Stevenage, the amount of smoke or sulphur dioxide in a known volume of air can then be calculated. Automatic Sequential Smoke Recorder In November an additional piece of smoke recording apparatus was loaned to the Department by the Warren Springs Laboratory for a special investigation which it was hoped to carry out in London early in 1962 This apparatus measures the smoke in the atmosphere by filtration through a filter paper but, in this case, the filter paper is in a continuous roll and is changed automatically every hour three hours or 24 hours as may be selected beforehand. This apparatus enables variations in smoke concentration during a day to be recorded. The apparatus described above merely gives the total smoke recorded during a period of 24 hours Quite marked variations are found to occur in Winter from hour to hour and it is hoped to investigate the relationships between these short-term variations and chest complaints such as bronchitis, in the hope of finding some connection This apparatus has been installed at the Town Hall alongside the normal equipment mentioned above EXHAUST FUMES FROM DIESEL VEHICLES The practice outlined in my report for I960- in which emissions of heavy exhaust smoke from vehicles were brought to the notice of the vehicle owners, has continued During 1961 six diesel operated vehicles were observed in the Borough to be emitting dark smoke of a sufficient density to warrant the attention of the owners being drawn to the fact It is, of course, in a firm's own interest to have a vehicle examined, as it is general experience that where black smoke is produced from a diesel engine, either the engine needs overhaul or adjustment or it is not being operated correctly and the emission of black smoke represents wasted fuel. Without exception, all six firms proved most co operative in having the vehicles immediately withdrawn from service, examined and the defect remedied.

Industry - Smoke Observations Regular observations are kept on factory and other boiler smoke stacks to ensure that any smoke emitted does not exceed that allowed by legislation. No contraventions have been observed from premises where the Council has responsibility for taking direct action. Formation of Industrial Committee Co operation with Industry In 1960 discussions and interviews were held to consider the formation of an Industrial Committee for the Borough upon which both the Council and local industry would be represented A meeting was held on the 24th January which was presided over by the Mayor and attended by 65 representatives from 55 industrial undertakings and certain members of the Council The Leader of the Council outlined the reason for the meeting and its aim. and the Chairmen of both Committees stressed the need for co operation between industrial undertakings and the Council in dealing with the various problems associated with industry and affecting residents. It was decided that the best way of handling the problem administratively was to classify the industries geographically so that when a specific problem or difficulty arose the firms within the area affected could be invited to send representatives to discuss the matter with the Council and its officers For this purpose it was decided to divide the Borough into five areas 46 Area No. 1. Chancellors Road to Fulham Football Ground. Area No. 2. Putney Bridge to Wandsworth Bridge. Area No. 3. Wandsworth Bridge to Stamford Bridge. Area No. 4. Stamford Bridge to Lillie Road. Area No. 5. Industries not included in Areas Nos. 1 to 4. Meetings were held on the 25th July and 4th December to consider problems arising in Area No. 1. FACTORIES ACTS The position at the end of 1961 was as follows:- Factories with mechanical power 303 Factories without mechanical power 277 The following is a summary of industries and trades registered as factories in the Borough:- Antique dealers 20 Boot repairers 39 Cement Works and Road Surfacing Materials 7 Clothing (including tailors, dressmakers, shirtmakers and bathing costume manufacturers) 27 Coal Wharf 1 Dyers and Cleaners 5 Dyers' and Cleaners' Receiving Depots 32 Electricity Generating Station 1 Engineers: Electrical 23 General 39 Precision 17 Sheet metal 11 90 Exhibition Stand and Display specialists 7 Pood (in all its branches - pie manufacturers, butchers, etc.) 28 Garages (services and repairs) 45 Gas Works l Laboratories 4 Launderettes 11 Laundries 9 Laundry Receiving Depots 18 Metal frame spraying 9 Oil Depots 5 Paint Manufacturer 1 Paper Bag and Cardboard Box Manufacturers 4 Photographic processing 1 Potteries 3 Printers: General 27 Silk Screen 4 31 Scrap Metal merchants 10 Timber Merchants and Joiners 43 Warehouses, Wharfingers and Bonded Stores 38 Miscellaneous 90 Total 580 The following is a record of inspections made and action taken. - Section 8 Premises Inspections No. of Notices served Factories without mechanical power (initial visits) 32 7 Factories with mechanical power (initial visits) 30 3 Other premises under the Act (building operations and works of engineering construction) 5 1 Number of re-inspections of all factories 1, 453 - 1,520 11 Number of cases in which defects were found:- Particulars Found Remedied Want of cleanliness 27 39 Inadequate ventilation 7 7 Inadequate lighting 5 6 Ineffective drainage of floors 5 5 Sanitary Conveniences: (a) Insufficient 16 13 (b) Unsuitable or defective 34 33 (c) Not separate for the sexes - - 94 103 No prosecutions were instituted under the Factories Acts during 1961. 47 Section 110 - Outwork Nature of Work No. of Outworkers on List Artificial flowers 1 Artificial jewellery 1 Boot making 2 Button carding 2 Fancy goods 6 Lampshades 10 Leatherwork 2 Millinery 5 Paper and plastic bags 2 Toymaking 49 Upholstery 3 Wearing apparel 71 154 164 visits were made to outworkers during the year. 48 Section E Inspection and Supervision of Food Page Food, Examination 49 Food, Voluntary surrender 49 Milk 49 Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations 50 Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations 51 Sampling, Foods and Drugs 51 Adulterated or Irregular Samples and Food subject of Complaint 52 Bacteriological Examination of Foodstuffs 54 Food Establishments, Inspection 54 Food Hygiene Regulations 55 Report of the Council's Public Analyst Thomas A. McLachlan 56 49 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD There are no offensive trades, slaughterhouses or licensed slaughtermen in the Borough. EXAMINATION OF FOOD AND SEIZURE OF UNSOUND FOOD Certain articles of food which are liable to be adulterated are controlled by sampling and chemical analysis by the Public Analyst, but foods which deteriorate in quality, and become unfit for human consumption are supervised by inspection and can be seized with subsequent condemnation by a Justice of the Peace and destruction. Voluntary Surrender of Food In practice, shopkeepers rarely attempt knowingly to sell to the public any foodstuff which is unfit for human consumption and it is customary for retailers who find food they have purchased from wholesalers to be unsound at the time they receive it or to have become unfit after storage on their premises to notify the local authority, and request an inspection by the district public health inspector who, if satisfied after examination that the food is unfit, issues a certificate to that effect and arranges for its removal to, and destruction at the Council's Refuse Destructor. The surrender of foodstuffs from various depots and food premises during the year involved the examination and destruction of the following articles and the issue of 947 certificates:- Tinned goods 12. 449 Fish 36 stone Meat 2,473 lbs. Chicken 578 lbs. Kidney 38 lbs. Cheese and cheese spread 71 lbs. Dates 1 lb. Milk Powder 231 lbs. Soup Powder 4 lbs. Walnuts 95 lbs. Chocolate 17 bars Honey 1 lb. SALE OF MILK REGULATIONS, 1939 The above Regulations state that where a sample of milk contains less than 3% of milk fat or less than 8.5% of solids not fat, until the contrary is proved, the sample shall be deemed to be not genuine. The following table sets out the monthly statement of the number of samples taken, together with the percentage of fat and non-fatty solids present:- No. of Average % MArch Samples fat Non-fatty solids January 7 3.61 8.63 February 3 3.58 8 59 March - April - May 4 3.41 8.74 June 4 3.73 8.79 July August 3 3.57 8.62 September 3 3.67 8.70 October 6 3.68 8.77 November 2 3.68 8.69 December 10 3.57 8.78 Monthly Average 3.61 8.70 50 Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations, 1956 These Regulations prohibit the sale for human consumption of milk described as "Channel Islands", "Jersey", "Guernsey", or "South Devon" if it contains less than 4% milk fat. The following table shows the details of samples taken:- Average % No. of samples Fat Non-fatty solids 22 4.40 9.02 In no case did a sample fall below the minimum of 4.04% milk fat. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 The following table gives details of samples taken under these Regulations:- Grade of Milk No. of Samples tested Phosphatase test Methylene blue test Turbidity test Passed Failed Passed Failed Void Passed Failed Pasteurised 31 31 - 29 1 1 - - Sterilised 12 - - - - - 12 - Tuberculin tested (Pasteurised) 19 19 - 17 - 2 - - With the coming into force of the Regulations on the 1st January, the licensing procedure was amended by the termination of issue of Supplementary Licences (previously issued to firms selling milk in areas outside that in which their registered premises were situated) and by the fixing of a five year period at the end of which all licences would need to be renewed. This means that all licences issued are for the period ending December 31st, 1965. Previously licences were renewable annually. Hie following are details of licences issued for the 5 year period mentioned:- To retail Tuberculin Tested Milk 88 To retail Pasteurised Milk 136 To retail Sterilised Milk 129 Registration of Purveyors of Milk The arrangement whereby milk was sold from retail shops continued and there were on the register at the end of the year 123 premises so engaged. Number of Inspections of milk dealers premises 150 Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1959 Ingredients used in the manufacture of ice cream are required to be pasteurised or sterilised and thereafter kept at low temperature until the freezing process is begun. Ice cream which has been allowed to reach a temperature exceeding 28°F must be heat treated again before sale. Exempted from the heat treatment requirements are water ices and ice lollies that are mixed before freezing and have a pH value of 4.5 or less. 51 Routine sampling has been carried out, and it is pleasing to report that every sample has reached the highest grade of cleanliness prescribed under the Regulations. Details of samples taken are as follows:- Wrapped "Loose" Total Ice Cream 25 3 28 Lollies 14 - 14 42 All samples reported in Grade 1. Soft Ice Cream The manufacture and sale of soft ice cream that is ice cream sold direct from specially designed freezers shortly after production has not. as yet. become a feature of trading in the Borough, only one premises being known to be equipped for this No vans, garaged in the Borough from which this ice cream is sold are known to exist Routine samples both chemical and bacteriological are obtained. All are satisfactory The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations. 1959 Hie Regulations prescribe standards for ice cream and for "Parev" (kosher) ice and separate standards for dairy ice cream and for milk ice. No type of ice cream shall contain any artificial sweetener The standard of composition briefly stated is as follows:- Ice Cream Shall contain not less than 5% fat and 7½% milk solids other than fat (Where ice cream contains any fruit, fruit pulp etc the total fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½% of the whole). Dairy Ice Cream Shall contain not less than 5% milk fat and no other fat, and not less than 7½% milk solids other than fat (Where dairy ice cream contains any fruit, fruit pulp, etc the total content of milk fat and milk solids other than fat, shall be not less than 12½% of the whole) Milk Ice (or milk ice containing any fruit, fruit pulp etc ) shall contain not less than 2½% of milk fat and no other fat and not less than 7% milk solids other than fat. "Parev" or kosher ice shall contain not less than 10% fat and no milk fat or other derivative of milk.

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF FOODSTUFFS Cream filled confectionery is an excellent medium for the growth of bacteria and thus the transmission of illness and because of this, routine sampling takes place of the filling at the bakeries and of the completed confectionery as exposed for sale in the shops. Samples are examined for the presence of faecal coliform bacilli and staphylococcus aureus. The results obtained were generally satisfactory 124 samples were submitted and 2 found to contain staphylococcus aureus In the first case the cakes were made at a local bakery and a visit was paid and all staff inspected as a source of possible contamination Further samples were all satisfactory. In the second case the retail shop was visited and notification sent to the bakery and the district in which it was situate In this case also, follow up samples were satisfactory. The following table sets out the results:- B. Coli (non faecal) present 124 B. Coli (faecal) present Staphylococcus aureus positive 2 Staphylococcus aureus negative 122 FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS Regular inspections were carried out during the year In no case was it found necessary to institute legal proceedings. 55 Type of Business No. of premises No. of Inspections Bakehouses (non-basement) 28 ) Bakehouses (basement) 2 ) 108 Bread and Cake shops 11 181 Butchers' shops 71 330 Confectionery 77 Cooked Meat shops 13 30 Milk distributors 123 158 Eel and Pie shops 3 7 Pood Factories 6 95 Fishmongers' shops 28 49 Fried Fish shops 27 41 General Food shops 227 531 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 116 98 Ice Cream (Manufacturers and Dealers) 228 223 Licensed Premises 104 115 Restaurants and Dining rooms 145 559 Stalls 100 560 Stallholders' Storage premises 44 40 Other Food premises 14 189 Miscellaneous 177 Under the provisions of Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, parts of premises used for the preparation of certain specified articles of food must be registered with the local authority. FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1955 AND 1960 The ever increasing tendency to the sale of prepacked foodstuffs is excellent from the food hygiene standpoint. It means that if conditions of production are satisfactory, a hygienically sound article reaches the home of the consumer - a feat which is the goal of all regulations concerned with food handling. Again, the constantly reducing number and increasing size of food production units usually - but initially not always - results in more modern and more hygienic methods of food production and handling. However, whether in food factory, cafe kitchen or foodshop, cleanly personal habits need to be pursued at all times It is this personal element that can so often be the cause of needless trouble. In three cases, legal proceedings were instituted for contravention of the Regulations: Date Regulation Offence Result 28. 11.61 Nos, 5, 16, 19, 23 Insanitary condition of sweet shop; infestation by insects; no adequate washing facilities for equipment; no wash hand basin.

Biol. ) During the year 1961. 800 samples of food and drugs were examined. Of these 250 were taken formally and 550 informally. The number adulterated or about which some comment was made was 42 The incidence of complaint may be classified as follows:- Number of samples examined Number of samples adulterated, etc. Milk 65 1 Other foods 716 41 Drugs 19 Two dirty milk bottles were examined as a result of complaints regarding their cleanliness. One contained a film consisting of dried milk which had become mouldy, and although the bottle had been through the washing machine, the dried milk had not been removed or detected by the bottle inspector before it had been filled The second bottle had a number of black patches adherent to the inner side. These patches consisted of what appeared to be very fine homogeneous particles of coke or anthracite coal cemented together in larger or smaller clumps by mould mycelium. As the milk appeared to be satisfactory and the bottle was not dirty over the whole of the inner surface it was obvious that the bottle had passed through the washing process, but that this had been insufficient to attack all the stale moulded milk and other residues. Several cans of pork luncheon meat were submitted, and of these three were badly swollen due to bacterial decomposition. The contents of a fourth can were badly decomposed but the can showed no signs of swelling owing to the absence of gas producing bacteria. These had all been improperly sterilised. A sample of margarine was found to show many dark areas on the outside surface due to a mould growth. The manufacturers expressed their regret at the occurrence and stated that this had been caused by the introduction of a new packing process, which had resulted in the parchment wrappers of their margarine being perforated in places with pinholes with the resultant introduction of mould spores. These spores had germinated and caused the dark patches. A sample of bread had a very yeasty odour, and it was thought that the loaf had been wrapped warm and then kept warm for some time. A slice of white bread contained a brown streak consisting of a piece of wholemeal bread which had been folded into the loaf during the moulding process. Both these complaints were considered to be due to carelessness in the bakery. A swiss bun contained a match which had been embedded in the dough before the bun was baked. Some glace cherries were fermenting and contained 0.24 per cent of alcohol due to the addition of insufficient sugar. Twenty five per cent of the cherries in another sample had been bird pecked. Glace cherries are used for decoration and should therefore be hand picked to ensure perfect quality. A sample of mixed peel was oxidised and possessed an objectionable odour This was probably old stock Some currants contained 9 maggots and a stone, and were therefore reported as adulterated. A blackcurrant health drink was stated to contain 20 mg. of vitamin C per fluid ounce when in fact it contained only 16.4 mg. This was probably due to deterioration owing to faulty manufacture or storage or both. During the year your analyst made a fairly extensive survey of samples of blackcurrant syrups on the market and submitted a copy of his report to your medical officer of health. Several samples of sage and parsley were high in ash. The samples of parsley contained 14.7% 20.7%, 31.28% respectively and the sage 11.43% Another sample of 57 sage contained 12 parts per million of lead, whereas the maximum quantity permitted is 10 parts per million. A follow up sample contained 4 parts per million of lead only and was therefore satisfactory. A steak pie was reported as inferior because it contained only 15 per cent of meat, whereas it must contain not less than 20 per cent. Another meat pie contained some black matter consisting of a mixture of grease and iron, no doubt due to carelessness in the bakery. One resident complained about the presence of black material in a pork pie Examination showed this to be derived probably from a part of the snout of a pig and although this is offal, it is not prohibited offal and the sample was reported as inferior. Two samples of pork sausages were slightly deficient in meat, containing 62 per cent and 63 per cent of meat respectively. Another sample was reported as inferior although it contained 65 per cent of total meat because the fat was in greater quantity than the lean meat, the fat being 34 per cent and the lean meat 31 per cent. A fourth sample was found to contain sulphur dioxide preservative the presence of which had not been declared. This failure to disclose the addition of preservatives in sausages is often due to suppliers of salt-spice-preservative mixtures not making it clear to sausage manufacturers that sausages containing the mixture are preserved sausages and must be sold as such. A roll and butter was really a roll spread with margarine and not with butter. A buttered roll must be spread with butter. Two French pastries were claimed to have been made with butter, but examination showed that they had been made with margarine, or a mixture of butter and lard. A sample of cultured cream was improperly labelled in that there is no provision for cultured cream under any food standard regulation or under the Labelling of Pood Order. Such a product must therefore be labelled with the ingredients used in their proper order of magnitude. Several samples of cheese spread were incorrectly labelled, as they bore no English labels. One had an English label on the inside of the carton container but not on the outside These were really samples of processed cheese and should have had their ingredients declared Another although not labelled in English was sold as a cream cheese, and as such would have been 25% deficient in fat, and a further sample sold as Camembert Cheese was in fact a margarine cheese. Nearly all these cheeses, apart from the fact that their labels were not in English, declared their fat contents as "i. T." which is the German abbreviation for "on the dry matter", but this is unintelligible to the English people One sample was stated to contain 45% of fat on the dry matter whereas it contained 29.75% and was, therefore, 34 per cent deficient in fat according to its own claims. The labelling of some sunflower oil was incorrect. It contained added vitamins which were declared in international units per 1b. on the label whereas the Labelling of Food Order required the declaration to be on each fluid ounce. Samples of ice lolly mix and ice lolly syrup were incorrectly labelled as the ingredients were not stated on their labels. As these preparations are not necessarily soft drinks within the meaning of the Soft Drinks Order the ingredients must be declared in accordance with the Labelling of Pood Order. A slimming aid product was incorrectly labelled, and since it made a claim that it contained "No drugs" it automatically made itself a food. As such all its ingredients and not merely active constituents must be disclosed in their order of magnitude whereas only three quarters of these ingredients were declared. Food Legislation The year brought little change in food legislation, although proposals were made for such changes. 58 The Lead in Pood Regulations, 1961. brought into force the proposals made by the Pood Standards Committee in 1959 The maximum quantity of lead permitted in a ready to drink non alcoholic beverage is 0.2 parts per million and for other foods 2.0 parts per million with the exception of certain foods. These are divided into two classes, those for which a larger amount of lead will be permitted for a limited time only and those which contain larger quantities of lead naturally and can never be kept to the low limit proposed for ordinary foods. Such foods include apples, pears, concentrated fruit juices and tomato puree or paste, fish and canned fish, raw sugars, including liquid or solid glucose, cocoa powder, tea. yeast and yeast products, dried onions, herbs, ground spices flavourings, and pectin. The quantity permitted in these foods is based on the amounts likely to be present from natural causes The Labelling of Pood (Amendment) Regulations. 1961. exempts wines prepared from preserved or concentrated grape juice from declaring the fruit juice from which they have been prepared, even though they have not been obtained from the fermentation of the freshly expressed juice. The Ministers of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: Health: and Scotland, and the Home Secretary have asked the Pood Standards Committee to undertake a review of the existing labelling of food provisions of the Labelling of Pood Order and other food regulations relating to labelling and the Food Standards Committee have asked for the views of any interested parties. The Food Standards Committee issued a supplementary Report on Preservatives in Pood together with proposals for new Regulations The problem of preservatives, food additives, and similar substances is becoming so complex that one cannot but sympathise with any committee advising a government at the present time In the opinion of your analyst, moreover, the time has now arrived when no country of importance can afford to make laws governing such additions without considering carefully the existing and possible legislation of other countries of similar development Your analyst will be the opening speaker next September at an International Symposium called to explore the matter of food regulations. In the meantime one can only consider legislation as it affects this country and agree that the Committee have made a brave attempt to cope with the position as it is. It is unfortunate that many substances, such as salt, glycerin, propylene glycol, acetic acid, and others should not be defined as preservatives, when they are the most efficient and commonest preservatives in use. When advising the Government on legislation the Committee have also to consider the possibility of its implementation and one can only state that many experts are in grave doubt about the implementation of food legislation now and in the future. It is suggested that sulphur dioxide and benzoic acid shall continue as permitted preservatives for certain foods and it is interesting to note that it is suggested that sulphur dioxide shall be recognised as a preservative in unfermented grape juice to be used for sacramental purposes, provided that not more than 70 parts per million are employed, while ordinary fruit juices to be used for other purposes may contain up to 350 parts per million. As an alternative 2,000 parts per million of benzoic acid, or methyl- or propyl-p. hydroxybenzoate may be employed The existing regulations have caused immense difficulties owing to an uncertainty which was never intended Methyl- or propyl p. hydroxybenzoate will be permitted also in liquid coffee or tea extracts, drinking chocolate concentrate, pickles and sauces, tomato pulp or liquid rennet. Here it is noted that liquid tea extract is given official notice for the first time in proposed British legislation and that permission will be given to use a preservative in a drinking chocolate concentrate, but there is no mention of chocolate syrups used on a very large scale for pouring over ice creams, puddings, etc. By definition these last are not flavouring syrups because they are not to be diluted with milk or water to make a drink with distinctive flavour nor can they be described as flavouring emulsions. It is proposed that bread shall be permitted to contain up to 3,000 parts per million, i.e. 0.3 per cent of propionic acid and that flour confectionery shall be permitted 1,000 parts per million of either propionic acid or sorbic acid Sorbic acid and nisin are to be permitted in cheese and nisin is also to be permitted in canned foods. Benzoic acid or sorbic acid are to be permitted in solutions of permitted food colours or in silicone anti-foam emulsions It will be difficult for an analyst to say whether a trace of sorbic acid in a food has been introduced by reason of the inclusion of a small amount of a silicone anti-foaming agent. Sodium nitrite and 59 nitrate are accepted as preservatives in cured meats and in Gouda and Edam type cheese Ortho phenylphenol may be employed as a preservative on apples, pears, pineapples, peaches, melons and citrus fruit, but no such permission is extended to apricots or to fruit such as Avocardo pears, which belong to the laurel family and are quite distinct from ordinary pears Citrus fruits may also contain diphenyl The food pattern of civilised countries is changing so rapidly at the present time that one wonders for how long such legislation can be effective. In support of the earlier note on the necessity for international collaboration in food legislation it may be mentioned that during the year W.H.O issued a press report to the effect that boric acid may be added to caviar for all countries except Germany and the United States Great Britain has forbidden its use since 1925. At the same time it may be mentioned that F.A.O. is now bringing out a series of monographs dealing with the legal position of food additives in various countries each monograph being written by an acknowledged expert of the country concerned. The monograph on food additives in Great Britain was the second to be issued in the series. Proposals have been issued by the Food Standards Committee for Soft Drinks Regulations Your analyst is greatly concerned that at the present time manufacturers of soft drinks can add vitamins or other ingredients to make them resemble official nutritional products and describe them by the official titles so long as letters such as BP, or B.P.C. are not used Blackcurrant syrups fall into this category, but so far. the Ministry has refused to take any action though now that even broadcasting has drawn attention to the matter the situation may be changed Similarly certain drinks need not comply with the requirements of the Regulations for sugar content if there is a clear and conspicuous description in writing indicating to the purchaser that the drink has been prepared for consumption by persons suffering from diabetes Products have been creeping on to the market recently which claim the protection of this proviso, but which are intended for slimming purposes and are not expected to be used primarily by diabetics. Even the names of the products suggest that they are intended for slimming Another provision which your analyst would like to see introduced is one to prevent claims such as "made from such and such fruit" for a product which complies with the requirement of the order to the extent that it contains 2 pounds of potable fruit and 4 5 pounds of sugar in 10 gallons, i.e. 100 lbs. of final drink, over 93 per cent of the drink being therefore added water. Following the issue towards the end of 1960 of the "Food Standards Committee Report on Bread and Flour" proposals for regulations were issued during 1961 Probably the most interesting point in these proposed regulations at the present time in view of the interest taken in slimming is that it shall be an offence to make any sort of claim, whether by inference or otherwise, that a bread rusk biscuit, or cereal food may be used as a slimming aid unless there is a clear statement indicating that it may only be so used if it forms part of a diet in which the total intake of calories is controlled. The Food Standards Committee were also asked to review the use of solvents and flavouring agents used in foods Apart from water the number of solvents employed is confined to a small number of chemical liquids but the number of chemicals employed for flavouring is very large. Proposals were also made for regulations to control the use of Emulsifiers and Stabilisers in Food. One of the difficulties of British law is that if the use of a substance is generally recognised as suitable and safe for a particular purpose it ceases to be such a substance by legal definition and these proposed regulations are no exception to this rule. Thus under the Labelling of Food Order sodium citrate, sodium tartrate, and sodium phosphates may be described generically as "Bnulsifying Salts" but under the proposed regulations they are not to be considered as "emulsifiers" or "stabilisers". It is hardly surprising that exporters from other countries complain that it is difficult to understand British law.

Ministry of Housing and Local Government Clean Air Act, 1956 - Industrial Furnaces. Works of Adaptation Eligible for Grant. Selection of Open Fires for Coke Burning. Notification of Provisional Plans for Establishing Smoke Control Areas. The Economic Situation. Turnstiles in Public Conveniences. Home Office Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 - Poisons List Order and Poison Rules Amendments. HEALTH EDUCATION As in 1960, the two principal subjects on which attention was concentrated were again "Clean Air" and "Home Safety". Clean Air is dealt with on page 39 under Smoke Control Areas. A list of titles of talks etc. on a variety of health matters with brief explanatory notes is sent to all organisations in the Borough which are likely to be interested in arranging a meeting. 64 The subjects covered range from Atmospheric Pollution to Rodent Control and audiences from Old Persons to Youth Clubs. The Department is very fortunate in having a number of members on the staff, both technical and administrative who are competent and willing to give talks or hold discussion groups on some particular aspect of health education. Details of Home Safety and other activities are as follows:- Home Safety Home Safety Act, 1961 This Act. which repealed Section 82 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1957. enables certain local authorities including Metropolitan boroughs, to promote safety in the home and to make contributions to voluntary organisations whose activities consist of or include the promotion of safety in the home. The operative date of the Act was the 18th May, 1961. Talks 6 talks on Home Safety were given to a total audience of 144. Average attendance 24 8 talks on Care and Maintenance of Oil Heaters were given to a total audience of 362. Average attendance 45 (These talks were directed principally to members of Old Persons' Clubs and were given by my deputy, Dr. C A Meade). Paraffin Oil Heaters - Modifications An advertisement was published in the local press and a letter sent to all shops in the Borough known to be selling oil heaters, drawing their attention to the advertisement and inviting their co-operation. The organisers of Old People's Social Clubs in the Borough were contacted and talks given to their members on the potential danger of using oil heaters which were defective through age or had not been properly maintained. A model heater and a variety of worn or damaged parts of heaters were loaned for demonstration purposes, together with leaflets entitled "Oil Heater Service". These leaflets were also distributed to all dealers in the Borough. Announcements at Old People's Concerts By agreement with the Civic Recreation Committee it was arranged that these announcements should be made on Home Safety and Road Safety at alternate shows. The first of these announcements was made on 6th December. Campaigns Details of the action taken in the campaigns supported by the Department are as follows:- "Use Gas the Safe Way" - January to March A press statement was issued in conjunction with the Gas Board incorporating an advertisement "Remember, Carelessness Kills - Use Gas the Safe Way". 150 posters "Guard against Escaping Gas" - were purchased. 100 of these being placed on commercial sites and the remainder on Council sites. Leaflets on the safe use of gas were sent to all Borough Organisations together with a circular letter drawing their attention to the campaign. A poster display was exhibited in the foyer of the Public Health Department. Every co operation was received from the North Thames Gas Board in connection with this campaign. 65 "Water Safety" launched on 10th May at Bisham Abbey All shops in the Borough selling bathing costumes and underwater equipment were circularised inviting them to exhibit a poster and distribute copies of a booklet entitled "Water Safety Code". The response was good and many firms requested additional copies of the Code. Articles appeared in the local press entitled "Water Wisdom" together with an advertisement regarding the issue of the "Water Safety Code". National Fire Prevention Week - 30th October to 4th November All organisations and hardware shops in the Borough were circularised asking them to use posters and other literature in order to publicise this Week, and there was a poster display in the Department s foyer. It was arranged with the London Fire Brigade that talks on this subject would be given by members of the Brigade. Articles were published in the local press on the necessity for fire prevention. Discussion Groups and Talks These were given on a variety of subjects the talks dealing with many of the varied aspects of the Department's activities. 5 discussion groups were held to a total audience of 103 persons. Average attendance 21 21 talks were given to a total audience of 497 persons. Average attendance 24 Film Shows Number of shows 8 Total attendance 633 Average attendance 79 "Friends of Fulham Hospital" Carnival and Garden Party Saturday, 1st July Continuing the practice of publicising a matter of topical Public Health importance, the Department entered a float with Rodent Control as its theme, which won second prize in its class at this Carnival. A photograph of the entry is on the centre pages. At the Garden Party the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents" Exhibition Unit on Dangers from Falls was on display and the following Road and Home Safety films were shown on a back projection film unit:- "I'm No Pool in Water" "How to Have an Accident" "I'm No Fool as a Pedestrian" "It's a Dangerous World" "Town Topics" - A Civic Newsletter issued to Fulham Residents The Council decided it would be of benefit to the citizens of the Borough generally and to themselves to issue this publication free to each household to keep them informed of Council activities. The first issue was made in January and subsequent issues in March June and September. The letters are distributed by hand with additional copies available at Council offices. The Department has contributed many of the articles and facts in the newsletters, and there is no doubt that it has proved a most useful health publicity medium. Press Publicity The help received from the local press in giving publicity to all the various health activities of the Department was greatly appreciated. Their co-operation in publishing articles, photographs, etc. was of tremendous value. 66 Leaflets and Posters As usual these were widely used in connection with the various campaigns, the principal sources of supply being the Central Council of Health Education, Ministry of Health and Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. The majority of the leaflets were distributed by means of the large display fixture in the foyer of the Department, but on occasions other Departments co-operated in distributing leaflets on matters of special topical importance. Visi ts From time to time parties of school children and students of various kinds were given talks and shown the work of the Department. Conclusion The work of Health Education goes on steadily and every opportunity is taken to try and seek new outlets and use new ideas to present it to the public, despite the fact that it is extremely difficult to assess the results obtained. It is interesting to note from the home accident statistics provided by the London Ambulance Service that Pulham appears to have fewer home accidents than the surrounding Boroughs in proportion to their respective populations. The figures for the last 3 years for the 4 West London Boroughs are as follows:- Home accident cases reported by the London Ambulance Service by Metropolitan Boroughs 1959 1960 1961 Fulham 267 221 308 Chelsea 85 99 111 Hammersmith 252 280 306 Kensington 433 403 459 MORTUARY ACCOMMODATION I am indebted to Dr. F. M. Day, Medical Officer of Health, Hammersmith, for details of the Fulham cases admitted to the Hammersmith Mortuary during 1961, as follows:- Number of cases admitted 224 (218 by order of the Coroner and 6 on application of Undertaker) Number of post-mortem examinations 218 Number of inquests held 33 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Section 50 - Burial or cremation of the dead 11 Funerals were arranged under the provisions of this section of the Act. Details of the cost of the burials are as follows:- £ s. d. 11 Funerals as per contract 207 10 0 Less amount recovered from estates of deceased, or by gifts, or responsible relatives 119 9 11 Balance, being cost to Council 88 0 1 67 PUBLIC CONVENIENCES There are 8 conveniences in use under the control of the Public Health Department, each with a Men's and Women's Section and with an attendant present during the whole period of opening. The conveniences have been constructed at various times between 1900 and 1961. All the conveniences have both a free and paid wash for the convenience of the public, the only exception being at Wyfold Road, where there is a free wash only. All W. C s are now available free of charge. These facilities are well used and appreciated and letters are frequently received from persons living outside the Borough congratulating all concerned on the condition of the conveniences. Gibbs' Green New Convenience (Builders - Tersons Ltd.) The new convenience, designed by the Borough Architect, Mr. E A McDonald, A. R. I. B. A. , F. I Hsg., on a site opposite the old underground one was opened on the 1st May The circular shape of the convenience has attracted favourable comment and a photograph of it is shown in the centre pages. Garden Seats. It was decided that two garden seats in the vicinity of the Gibb's Green Convenience would provide a useful amenity. A donation of ten guineas was received from the Metropolitan Public Gardens' Association towards the cost of these seats and this was acknowledged by the fixing of an appropriate plaque to one of them. The seats have been placed in the centre of a garden refuge at the junction of Mund Street with North End Road directly opposite the convenience. Improved Lighting During the year fluorescent lighting was installed at Lillie Road. New King' s Road and Effie Road Conveniences which means that every convenience, with the exception of Wyfold Road, now has modern improved lighting. Wyfold Road has not been altered as it was built primarily for persons attending the Employment Exchange and, therefore, it closes at 5 p.m. Mondays to Thursdays and 6 p. m. on Fridays. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year 141 medical examinations were carried out. These included the examination of new entrants to the Council' s service, to determine their medical fitness for the post and their suitability for acceptance under the Superannuation Scheme. Others were referred because of prolonged sick leave or accident. The latter usually required specialist investigation and this is done in collaboration with the patient's private doctor. A useful addition to the equipment of the department was a Fleming "Master Vision Screener". This apparatus applies fourteen vision tests to a subject's eyesight in a rapid and convenient manner. From the results obtained the presence of a defect of vision can be quickly ascertained. It is not generally realised that 30-40% of the population suffer from a defect of vision of which they are quite unaware. Such visual defects can cause physical discomfort, fatigue, loss of efficiency, and may even endanger life. In most cases these defects, when detected, can be corrected or improved. This apparatus is the counterpart of the Mass X-Ray Service which detects lung diseases in their early and curable stages and before a person realises he is ill - this eye-testing equipment can reveal defects of which a person may be unaware. 68 The equipment is used at the medical examination of all new entrants to the Council's service. It was also made available on a voluntary basis to all existing staff. Where a defect of vision is detected the person is advised to see their own optician or doctor, as appropriate, for further advice re glasses, etc. The apparatus has proved useful. In a few cases it has brought to light serious loss of vision which had not been recognised by the person concerned. Where appropriate employees are offered re-examination after a suitable interval. The testing of the patient is carried out by a lay person trained in the technique but the interpretation of the findings is done by a medical officer. Some experience is needed by the medical officer in interpreting the results as the apparatus is very sensitive and can detect minor defects which may be of little immediate importance. The findings were as follows:- Tests carried out with Master Vision Screener Staff: Vision Normal Advised further investigation Re-examination in one year Existing staff 106 56 9 New entrants to Council employment as part of medical examination 44 6 — Employees: As part of the medical examination either as new entrant or for admission to the superannuation scheme 41 15 191 77 9 Total 277 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act regulates the sale of pet animals and empowers a local authority (in London a Metropolitan Borough) to grant licences to keep a pet shop on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings. During 1961 one business closed leaving eight premises in respect of which licences were renewed. No contraventions of the Act were found during 14 inspections. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 19 33 The retail sale of poisonous substances by shopkeepers who are not registered pharmacists is controlled by the Act and Rules made thereunder. The Poisons List, which has been prepared by the Poisons Board and confirmed by the Home Secretary, prescribes two Lists of Poisons - Part I and Part II. The sale of poisons included in Part I is restricted to registered pharmacists whilst those included in Part II may be sold to the general public not only by registered pharmacists, but also (subject to certain conditions) by ordinary traders whose names are entered on a List of Persons entitled to sell such poisons, kept by the Local Authority. The Acts and Rules lay down certain requirements regarding type of container, labelling, storage, transport and sale of poisons, penalties being prescribed for non-compliance. Fees are payable to the local authority by persons whose names are entered on the List. 69 At the end of 1961 there were 146 names on the Council1 s List and the following changes took place in the Register during the year:- Number of listed sellers on Council's register at 1.1.61 148 Number added during the year 11 159 Number who transferred their business or discontinued the sale of poisons 13 146 46 visits to listed premises were made during the year under review. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Under this Act it is unlawful in the course of business to use filling materials to which the Act applies in any form of upholstery, the stuffing or lining of toys, baby carriages, etc., except on premises registered by a local authority (in London, a Metropolitan Borough). It is also an offence to sell or expose for sale on any premises any article containing filling material to which the Act applies, which is unclean. The standards of cleanliness for the various types of filling material are laid down in the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Regulations. 1951-1954, superseded on the 1st August by the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Regulations, 1961. At the beginning of the year there were seven premises registered for the use of filling materials. During the year one firm vacated their premises leaving six registered premises at the end of 1961. During the year samples were taken as follows:- Type of Filling No. of Samples Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Algerian Fibre 1 1 — Woollen Mixture Felt 1 1 — Hair 1 1 — Washed Felt 1 1 — Black Fibre 1 1 —- Corded Hair 1 1 — Hair and Fibre Mixture 1 1 — Total 7 7 — All the samples were of filling material taken at registered premises. 70 APPENDIX A METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF FULHAM TOWN HALL, FULHAM, S. W. 6. To: All Property Owners. Repairs to Structural Timbers A frequent and expensive item of property maintenance is the replacement and repair of timber damaged by either woodworm or fungus (wet rot or dry rot). These are living infections and if not properly controlled will spread and do further damage. Both these conditions are on the increase throughout this Country woodworm infestation particularly so - and most properties sooner or later are likely to be affected by one or both of these troubles. Prevention of trouble is better and much cheaper than cure and I would, therefore, like to suggest that it is in your own interest, when carrying out the repairs listed in the attached Notice, to use only timber which has been properly and thoroughly treated by a reliable fungicide or insecticide or a combined preparation, It can be a complete waste of money to replace defective timber by untreated material. In fact, we know of cases in the Borough where reinfestation or reinfection has occurred within 18 months of repairs being carried out with untreated timber. It is most important to use only a reliable brand of fungicide or insecticide It can be a waste of time and money to use "creosote", which varies so much in composition and may give no protection. It is also important in the case of the rots to remove extensively apparently sound timber adjacent to the obviously affected areas and to treat thoroughly and appropriately adjacent brick work concrete, etc. which can also harbour the fungus Great care should also be exercised in removing and disposing of worm-eaten or rotted timber to avoid spreading the trouble and such timber should never be placed near or in contact with sound timber. If either of these conditions is found in any of your properties, it is worth considering whether an expert examination of all the structural timbers is desirable. This is a matter you might wish to discuss with your builder. If trouble is found, or as a long-term preventive to avoid trouble in sound timber, expert treatment of all the timbers is a worth while investment. A list of firms in the London Area specialising in this work can be obtained from the Health Department.
