ORP 6 ORPINGTON URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL REPORT For the Year 1942 on the Sanitary Conditions and Vital Statistics of the Urban District of Orpington by the Medical Officer of Health. Bromleg: kentish district times co., ltd., 22, north street. 1 URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL OF ORPINGTON. Health Report for 1942. Madam and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Health Report for the year 1942, this being the twentieth one presented by me as your Medical Officer of Health. Again this year the Report is curtailed as far as possibler and contains only such essential features as it is necessary to record. The population of the District as estimated by the Registrar-General at mid-year 1942 was 47,990 as compared with 46,270 last year. The Birth Rate for the year showed an increase, this being 20.6 per thousand of population, as against 16.4 last year. The Death Rate for the year was 11.1 per thousand of population, which compares very favourably with that for the previous year, viz., 12.3 per thousand of population. An improvement also took place in respect of the Infantile Mortality Rate, this being 28 per thousand registered births in 1942 and 51 in 1941. Owing to the small numbers involved, this Rate is liable to fluctuate. The year has been a satisfactory one with regard to the incidence of Infectious Disease. Although a much smaller number of cases were notified, this is mainly due to a reduction in the number of cases of Measles. In presenting this Report, I desire to place on record my appreciation of the help and assistance I have received from the Council and its Officers. In particular, I would like to express my thanks for the efficient and loyal services rendered by all members of the Public Health Department. I am, Madam and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. N. CAYE, Medical Officer of Health. 2 URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL OF ORPINGTON. Public Health Committee. Chairman: P. H. Baker, Esq. Vice-Chairman: W. E. Hawken, Esq. Mrs. E. E. Phillips. R. Hamilton, Esq.
