September 13th, 1946. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Borough of Wood Green. Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you my Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the year 1945. The Report is again a short one, and gives little more than an outline of the work of the Health Department throughout the year. The year has been uneventful so far as the general health of the community is concerned. The incidence of infectious disease has been low, and for the sixth year in succession there has been no death recorded from diphtheria. The Birth-Rate has fallen again after the rise recorded a year ago, and the Death-Rate is slightly higher, but the Infantile Mortality Rate at 27.3 per 1,000 live births is the lowest ever recorded in Wood Green. With the end of the European War in May, the Civil Defence Casualty Services ceased to call on the time and attention of various members of the Department and normal routine was quickly resumed. I wish to express my thanks to the Chairman and members of the Public Health and Maternity and Child Welfare Committees for their support and to all the staff of the Health Department for their loyal co-operation throughout the year. Your obedient servant, MALCOLM MANSON, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area (acres) 1,607 Population—Estimate supplied by the Registrar-General 44,940 Number of inhabited houses (end of 1945, according to the Rate Books) 13,599 Rateable Value, 1945 £547,152 Sum represented by a penny rate £2,120 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR. Live Births— Total. M. F. Legitimate 647 336 311 Birth Rate 15.9 per 1,000 Illegitimate 47 28 19 Still Births 15 8 7 Rate per 1,000 births 21.1 Deaths 616 317 299 Death Rate 13.7 per 1,000 Deaths from Puerperal Causes:— Puerperal Sepsis Nil Rate per 1,000 Births, — Other Puerperal Causes .. Nil Rate per 1,000 Births, — Deaths of Infants under 1 year of age:— All Infants 19 Rate per 1,000 Live Births, 27.3 Legitimate 18 Rate per 1,000 legitimate Live Births, 27 6 Illegitimate 1 Rate per 1,000 illegitimate Live Births, 21.2 Deaths from:— Cancer (all ages) 94 Measles (all ages) Nil Whooping Cough (all ages) Nil Diarrhoea (under 2 years of age) 1 Number of Births notified 691 Number of Births Registered in the Borough 219 5 POPULATION. The estimate of population supplied by the Registrar-General is a little higher than that for the previous year, and now that so many men and women are returning to civilian life from the Forces it is reasonable to expect that the population will shortly reach almost what it was before the war. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered during the year was 694, which gives a Birth-Rate of 15.9 per 1,000 of population. This is a considerable reduction as compared with 1944, when the births totalled 824, and the Birth-Rate was 18.7. The number of stillbirths was 19, and the Still-Birth Rate was 21.1 per 1,000 births. DEATHS. The number of deaths credited to Wood Green, after the necessary adjustments had been made for inward and outward transfers was 616. This gives a Death-Rate of 13.7 per 1,000 of population, which compares unfavourably with 12.8 the figure for the previous year. Of the total of 616 deaths, no fewer than 398, or almost 65 per cent. occurred at ages over 65, and of these 111 were of persons over 80 years and 13 of persons over 90 years of age. The individual causes of death are shown in Table III in the Appendix. It will be seen there that the principal cause of death was heart disease which was responsible for 178 deaths. Other diseases of the circulatory system caused death in 38 cases, and intra-cranial vascular lesions in 74 cases, so that out of a total of 616 deaths, no fewer than 290 were attributed to diseases of the heart and circulation. The number of deaths attributed to diseases of the respiratory system, apart from pulmonary tuberculosis was 72. Deaths certified as due to cancer numbered 94, and 31 deaths were caused by tuberculosis. Only one death occurred from the principal zymotic diseases— enteric fever, smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough and diarrhoea in children under 2 years, namely one death from diarrhoea. The zymotic death rate was 0.02 per 1,000 of population. 6 INFANTILE MORTALITY. The number of deaths of children under 12 months was 19 which gives an Infantile Mortality Rate of 27.3 per 1,000 live births. This is the lowest rate ever recorded in Wood Green, and is appreciably less than that for the previous year, 31 per 1,000 live births, which was itself the lowest previously recorded. It is remarkable that this very low Infantile Mortality Rate should be recorded in the sixth year of war, and it seems to suggest that so far at least as the mothers and children of the community are concerned, war-time rationing had no ill-eflects. It is not too much to attribute the good health which the infant population has enjoyed, in part at least to the priorities allowed to nursing and expectant mothers and young children in respect of milk, cod liver oil, orange juice and special vitamin preparations. Of the total of 19 Infantile Deaths. five occurred within 24 hours of birth, and 8 during the first month of life. Of the five occurring during the first 24 hours, two were certified as premature, and another premature infant died at 5 days. The special equipment which was provided in 1944 for use by midwives in the case of premature infants has been available for use in the case of such infants nursed at home. MATERNAL MORTALITY. No deaths were certified as due to childbirth or any of its complications, so that the Maternal Mortality Rate was nil. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. The number of live births registered as belonging to Wood Green was 694, and the number notified under the Notification of Births Act, 678 or 97.6 per cent. of the registered births. Of the 694 births registered, only 219 actually occurred in Wood Green, all the others occurring in hospitals or nursing homes outside the district. The following table shows where the majority of these confinements took place. North Middlesex Hospital 88 City of London Hospital 80 Mothers' Hospital, Clapton 34 Royal Northern Hospital 37 Evacuated under L.C.C. Scheme 29 7 In practically all these cases the hospital provision was arranged from the Child Welfare Centre, but in a futher 68 cases the confinement took place in various hospitals under private arrangements made by the mothers themselves, while 97 births belonging to Wood Green took place in nursing homes outside the district. Of the 219 births registered as taking place within the Borough, 185 were attended by the Council midwives. From the figures given above, it will be seen that over 60 per cent. of the Wood Green births in 1945 took place in hospitals or nursing homes, all of them outside the district. There is now no maternity hospital or nursing home in Wood Green and at the end of the year I reported to the Maternity and Child Welfare Committee on the position, and the possibility of doing anything to improve it. There is a very great dearth in Wood Green of large houses or other buildings which could be converted into a maternity nursing home or hospital, and under present conditions the likelihood of being able to provide a new building would seem to be remote. The majority of mothers are anxious to have their confinements in institutions rather than at home, and this preference seems likely to continue or even increase. For the moment it would seem that our only hope of increased maternity institutional accommodation for Wood Green mothers rests with Middlesex County Council. CHILD WELFARE CENTRES. The total attendances at the White Hart Lane Centre were 11,822, compared with 10,622 in the previous year. At Alexandra Park Centre the attendances were 3,115 a small increase over 3,012, the figure for the previous year. The number of children brought to Centres was 2,244, of whom 1,240 were infants under one year and 1,004 children of from one to five years. The number of children seen at the Centres by Dr. Miller during the year was 2,205 and of these 1,229 were infants and 976 children from one to five years. Of the 19 infantile deaths which occurred during the year, in ten cases the baby had been brought at least once to one of the Centres. 8 Ante-Natal Clinics were held at the White Hart Lane Centre on Tuesday afternoons, Friday afternoons and alternate Saturday mornings throughout the year. The number of expectant mothers who attended was 456. HOME VISITING. The Health Visitors made a total of 6,119 visits during the year. Of these, 269 were ante-natal visits to expectant mothers. 2.856 to babies under one year, and 2,994 to children of from one to five years. The Health Visitors also continued to act as Infant Life Protection Visitors, visiting all licensed foster-mothers and foster-children at regular intervals. There were five foster-mothers and eight foster-children on the Register at the end of the year. Free Food. Free food consisting of dried milk and cod-liver oil emulsion was issued to necessitous expectant and nursing mothers attending the Centres at a cost of £19 19s. 9d. Cod-liver oil, fruit juice and vitamin tablets were issued at the Centres with the co-operation of the stag of the local Food Office. A return received from the Food Office early in the present year suggests that in Wood Green as in most districts not sufficient advantage is taken of the special provision of cod-liver oil, fruit juice and vitamins for children under school age. During the five weeks ending December 29th, 1945, the weekly average issue represented the following percentages of the total potential :— Cod-liver Oil 35.22 per cent. Orange Juice 54.76 per cent. Vitamin Tablets 56.54 per cent. This means that roughly only half of the children for whom this special provision was available was actually receiving the benefit. War-time Day Nurseries Both war-time nurseries continued to be used to capacity throughout the year, the average daily attendance at St. Michael's being 34, and at the White Hart Lane Nursery 40. Apart from occasional outbreaks of the commoner infectious diseases, which are very difficult to prevent in institutions of this kind, the health 9 of the children has on the whole been very good, and with housing conditions such as they are at present, and large numbers of mothers still in employment, the contribution made by these nurseries to the health and well-being of the children admitted is very real. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. The following tables give a very brief summary of the routine work of the Sanitary Inspectors during the year:— Inspections and Re-inspections of dwelling houses:— Total 2,098 Enquiries in connection with Infectious Diseases:— Total 137 Inspections of registered premises:— Total 735 Miscellaneous Inspections:— Total 1,403 Work Carried Out:— Drains reconstructed Nil Drains repaired 60 New water closets 2 Water closets repaired 63 Premises cleansed, etc. I Rooms disinfested 8 Accumulations of refuse removed nil Keeping of animals discontinued 1 Dampness in premises remedied 238 Houses repaired 475 Miscellaneous 324 Total 1,172 House-to-House Inspection.

Table IV in the Appendix gives details of all cases of infectious disease notified during 1945. The total of 494 is rather less than that for the previous year which was 527, and the incidence of infectious disease was generally very low. 172 cases of measles, and 117 of whooping cough were notified, in each case without a death. 62 cases of Scarlet fever were notified also without a death, and only two cases of diphtheria occurred throughout the year. For the sixth year in succession no death occurred from diphtheria in Wood Green, a record which must be considered very satisfactory. There were 31 deaths from tuberculosis and 27 from pneumonia. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION. Immunisation against diphtheria was carried out as in former years, the total number of children immunised during the year being 680. Of these 522 were under 5 years of age, and 158 aged from 5 to 15 years. The material used in all cases was Alum Precipitated Toxoid, provided free by the Ministry of Health. At the end of the year it was estimated that 56 per cent. of the children under 5 had been immunised and 88 per cent. of those from 5 to 15. 13 SCABIES. The prevalence of scabies was very much less than in 1944, the total number of cases being 171, as compared with 277 in the previous year. Of these, 27 were under school age, 56 were school children and 88 were adults. Treatment was provided at the FirstAid Post in White Hart Lane, until it closed down in June, and afterwards all cases were sent to the Hornsey Cleansing Station, by arrangement with the Hornsey Borough Council.
