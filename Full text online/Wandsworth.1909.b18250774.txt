The Council's Petition in opposition to the Scheme of the Weir Hospital Chanty.

Lawrence, K.C., and Mr. Shebbeare, the majority of the Trustees by Mr. Jessel, K.C., and Mr. Sheldon, and the Attorney General by Mr. Austen Cartmel. The judgment of Mr. Justice Eve concluded as follows, viz.:— "The result is I cannot accede to the prayer of the Petition, and, unless any serious objection is raised, I propose to make no order upon it, except that the costs of the Petitioners and of the Respondents be taxed as between Solicitor and Client, and be paid out of the current income." 16. The Council decided to appeal against the decision of Mr. Justice Eve. The appeal came before the Court of Appeal (consisting of the Master of the Rolls and Lords Justice Farwell and Kennedy) on the 24th and 25th May, 1910, and the Court, on the 7th June, unanimously allowed the appeal and referred the matter back to the Charity Commissioners, so that the fund may be applied under a Scheme so framed as to give effect to the directions contained in the testator's will. The Court made a similar order as to costs as was made in the Court below. 17. Alderman Hewett, Councillors Anderson, and Garrett,. Junr., whose term of office expired on the 10th October last, were re-appointed the Council's representatives on the Committee of Management of the Weir Hospital Trust for the current year. 18. In June, 1910, the Council considered the draft scheme of Edward Baker charity. the Charity Commissioners for the administration of the Edward Baker Charity. 38 The Trust Fund consists of £12,288 5s. 8d. Consols, the gross yearly income being £307 4s. od. The scheme provided that the Charity should be administered by four ex-officio Trustees, three Representative Trustees, and two Co-optative Trustees ; that the ex-officii Trustees shall be the Rector of Holy Trinity, Clapham; the Vicar of St. James', Park Hill; the Minister of the Congregational Chapel, Grafton Square, and the Minister of the Wesleyan Chapel, High Street, Clapham; the first representative Trustees, A. D. Dawnay, J. W. Cundall, and T. Young; and the first Co-optative Trustees, J. Lidiard and B. R. Tucker, of 49, Sisters Avenue, Clapham Common ; that Representative Trustees are to hold office for four years and Co-optative Trustees for five years ; that all proper costs and expenses incidental to the management of the Trust are to be defrayed out of the income thereof, and that the Trustees may pay a yearly sum not exceeding £100 to the Trustees of the Hibbert Almshouses and shall apply the balance of the income for the benefit of pensioners. The pensioners are to be Protestants of good character, of 60 years of age or upwards, who have resided in Clapham for not less than 10 years, and have not received Poor Law relief other than medical relief during the last two years, and who from age, ill-health, accident, or infirmity, are, wholly or in part, unable to maintain themselves by their own exertions. Pensions are not to be less than 5s. nor more than 10s. per week and are to be granted for periods of three years. Future Representative Trustees are to be appointed by the Borough Council. The Charity Commission was informed that this Council was prepared to appoint future Representative Trustees, and it was suggested to the Charity Commission that the following amendments should be made in the scheme, viz.:— (a) Clause 6. That the term of office of future Representative Trustees be 3 years instead of 4 years. (b) Clause 8. That the term of office of future Co-optative Trustees be 4 years instead of 5 years. (c) Clause 21. That the sum to be paid annually to the Trustees of the Hibbert Almshouses be limited to £26, being the sum by which the income of the Trustees was reduced by the alteration of the rate of the dividend on the capital of the Almshouses Trust. (d) Clause 23. That the words limiting the granting of pensions to persons of 60 years of age or upwards be left out. 19. In December last a letter was received from the Charity Commission forwarding copy of the scheme, and stating that the 39 scheme had been amended in accordance with the suggestion of the Council that the sum to be paid annually to the Trustees of the Hibbert Almshouses should be reduced, and that the words limiting the granting of pensions to persons of 60 years of age or upwards should be left out. The Commissioners stated that they. were unable to adopt the other suggestions of the Council. 20. Mr. Frederick Newens, of 167, High Street, Putney, was Putney Chanties. re-appointed to act in the administration of the Charities of Henry Smith and Sir Abraham Dawe's Almshouses for a period of four years from the 22nd September last. 21. The period for which Councillor Mellhuish, the Rev. Tooting Bevill Allen, and Messrs. J. Cusden, W. Eland, and Chanties. j perry were appointed the Council's representatives to act in the administration of Henry Smith's Charity having expired, the Council re-appointed Councillor Mellhuish, the Rev. Bevill Allen, and Messrs. J. Cusden, J. Perry, and appointed Councillor J. Wright Hallett its representatives for a period of four years from the 22nd September last. 22. Councillor Phillips was re-appointed a Representative Streatham Chanties. Trustee on the Body of Trustees to administer the Streatham Non-Ecclesiastical Charities for four years from the 14th March, 1910. 23. The Charity Commissioners have made a scheme varying the scheme for the regulation of the Non-Ecclesiastical Charities of Streatham, so as to provide that the number of pensionersmay be increased if and as the charity permits, and that the receipt of Poor Law relief shall not disqualify a person from being an almsperson or pensioner of the charity. 24. The period for which Mr. A. J. Littlechild was elected a Wandsworth Technical Institute. representative of the Council on the Governinjr Body of the Wandsworth Technical Institute ing expired, Mr. Littlechild was re-elected a representative of the Council on such Body until July, 1911. The period for which Alderman Robinson and Mr. J. Luscombe were elected on such Body having also expired, Alderman Robinson was re-elected, and Councillor Buchanan elected a member of such Body until July, 1912. c 40 25. During the year Alderman Bulcraig and Alderman Commission of Peace. Hewett were placed upon the Commission of Peace for the County of London. 26. Councillor Anderson, M.A., has been re-appointed this Local Pension Committee. Council's representative on the Sub-Committee for this Borough and the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea of the Local Pension Committee. 27. In July, 1909, the Council approved a list of officers and Superannuaservants to be placed on the permanent establishment by a resolution of the Council in accordance with the definition in the Act of the terms "officer" and "servant." Seven officers and servants gave notice under Section 15 of the Act of their intention not to avail themselves of the provisions of the Act. In these cases deductions will not be made from the salaries or wages, and if the Superannuation Act of 1866 applies, they will remain subject to the provisions of that Act. Mr. T. Cans Ackland, F.I.A., was retained to furnish the report and certificate required by Section 13 of the Act, and he certified that the sum of £400 (the minimum sum prescribed by the Act) is to be paid into the Superannuation Fund during the quinquennial period commencing 1st April, 1910, as the primary annual contribution of the Council. 28. The alteration in the system of compounding for rates, Compounding mentioned in the last Annual Report (page 39), for Kates. took effect as from the 1st October last. The number of properties in the Borough in the quarter ended 31st December last of a rateable value not exceeding £20, was 32,163. The number compounded for in that quarter was 26,326, leaving the number not compounded for, 5,837, the bulk of which were paid for by owners (when occupied). It is estimated that the nett increased income for the half year ended 31st March last, consequent upon the alteration in the system, is over £4,000. The change has also had the effect of considerably expediting the collection. 29. At the last quinquennial valuation (1905) of the Borough, Quinquennial the Council engaged Mr. C. Barker (the Council's Valuation. valuer for new properties) for the valuation of railway, gas, and other Companies' undertakings, licensed premises, and such other special properties as might be deter- 41 mined, and another valuer for all other properties for a fee at the rate of £10 10s. for four days' attendance per week. The Council was of opinion that it was not necessary to engage a Valuer for ordinary properties for the quinquennial valuation this year, there being in the possession of the Council much information which was not available five years ago. Mr. Barker was engaged for the valuation of railway and other special properties, and a SubCommittee of the Rating Committee was appointed to provisionally settle the draft Quinquennial Valuation List. The Sub'Committee held fourteen meetings, each occupying several hours, and the list, which contains 65,000 separate assessments, compared with 55,691 in 1905, was deposited with the Assessment Committee of the Union on the 31st May. The statement on the following page shows the Valuation, before the List was submitted for revision by the Assessment Committee, as compared with the Valuation in 1905, and the values at 2nd April, 1910. 42 QUINQUENNIAL VALUATION, 1910.

Complaints having been received of annoyance arising Street from shouting in connection with the use of certain Shouting. premises in the Borough as places of entertainment, the Council on the 28th July, 1909, made the following ByeJaw on the subject, viz.:— "No person shall, for the purpose of announcing or advertising any show or entertainment, shout in any street or public place to the annoyance of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. "Any person who shall offend against the foregoing Bye-law shall be liable for every such offence to a fine not exceeding forty shillings." 31. Complaint having been made by two ratepayers under the MUSic and provisions of 25 Geo. II., ch. 26, that the King's Licences. Hall, Tooting, was used for purposes of public music without a license, proceedings were taken against the owner of the premises as required by the statute. The case came before a jury at Quarter Sessions, and the owner was convicted, fined Is. and ordered to pay the Council's costs. There was no complaint as to the suitability of the premises for the entertainment, nor as to the class of entertainment. The Council were obliged to take the proceedings upon receipt of the prescribed notice and to pay each of the two informers £10. The Council being of opinion that the law should be altered so as to allow of proceedings being taken before a court of summary jurisdiction, asked the London County Council to take the necessary steps to obtain an amendment of the law accordingly. The County Council has since promoted a Bill in Parliament, which will carry out the suggestion, and will authorise that Council to grant music and •dancing licenses at other times as well as at the Annual Licensing Meeting. 32. Proceedings were taken by the Council in four cases with Disorderly respect to disorderly houses, and the following conHouses. victions obtained, viz. :—Fined £5, or one month's hard. labour; fined 40s., or 14 days' hard labour; two months' imprisonment with hard labour; and six months' imprisonment with hard labour, respectively. 33. The Council had under consideration the unsatisfactory and inadequate accommodation for the transaction County Court. of business at the Wandsworth County Court, and in July, 1909, called the attention of the Lord Chancellor and the Treasury to the matter and asked that steps should be taken for 44 the provision of a larger building in the Borough of Wandsworth,, with appropriate accommodation. In April last the Lord Chancellor stated that he understood that H.M. Office of Works had settled on plans for improving the accommodation of the Court. The Office of Works have been asked what steps are being taken in the matter, but up to the present no information has been furnished. 34. The Council considered the order in Council establishing Juvenile Juvenile Courts under the Children Act, 1908. The Courts. order provides that Juvenile Courts are to be provided at six police courts in London, including Westminster, the district assigned to the latter Court being the divisions assigned to the Westminster, South Western and West London Police Courts. The Council being of opinion that six Courts for the whole of the County is inadequate, and the area assigned to Westminster much too large, called the attention of the Home Secretary to the matter and asked for the provision of more Courts,, including one in this Borough. No reply has yet been received. 35. The following Parliamentary Bills were considered by the Parliamentary Bills. Council, viz.: — London County Council (Tramways and Improvements). London County Council (General Powers). Gas Companies (Standard Burner) No. 1. Crystal Palace. Mercantile Corporations and Companies (Municipal Franchise). Municipal Representation. Voters (Qualification and Registration). London Elections. Milk and Dairies. Vehicles on Highways. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains. Moveable Dwellings. Housing of the Working Classes.

Local Government Qualification (England and Wales).. London Electric Supply. Municipal Elections. Payment of Rates. Sale of Margarine. London County Council (Tram-ways and Improvments). 36. This Bill proposed to authorize the County Council to- construct new tramways, and to reconstruct exist, mg tramways in various parts of London. 37. The proposed tramways in this Borough were tramways Nos. 8 and 8a (from the existing tramways at Putney Bridge along High Street, Putney, Putney Bridge Road, High Street,. Wandsworth, to York Road, Wandsworth), of which 1 m. 1 f. 10.30 ch. will be double, and 5.45 ch. single line. This route is in substitution of the proposed tramways along Upper Richmond Road and Putney High Street, referred to in the last Annual Report (page 42), and was adopted by the London County Council at the request of this Council. The tramway along Putney BridgeRoad is to be worked by the overhead system, and along High Street, Wandsworth, by the underground electrical system. 38. The Council petitioned against the Bill in order to protect the interests of this Borough. Several conferences were held between the Officers of this Council and of the County Council,, and finally an agreement was entered into by the two Councils with reference to the widening of High Street, Wandsworth (including the bridge over the River Wandle), and Putney Bridge Road, the paving of roads and footpaths and other matters connected with the construction of the proposed tramways. Upon the agreement being entered into this Council withdrew its opposition to the Bill, which received Royal Assent on the 3rd August last. 46 39- This Bill proposed to amend the Public Health (London)LondonCountyCouncil(General Powers). Act, 1891, by omitting the word "black" from . Section 24. The section is as follows :— "Any chimney (not being a chimney of a private dwelling-house) sending forth black smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance." It also proposed to empower the County Council to enforce other provisions of the Act of 1891, and to amend the law as to employment agencies, and contained similar provisions with regard to milk supply as were contained in the Bill mentioned in the last Annual Report (page 43). This Council made no order with regard to the Bill. The clauses relating to milk were deleted, and the provisions relating to smoke altered during progress of the Bill in Parliament. 40. This Bill was promoted by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Companies (Standard Burner)No. 1. Gaslight and Coke Co., the Brentford Gas Co., and eight other Companies, and provided that the testing for illuminating power of the gas supplied by the promoting Companies shall be by means of the Standard Burner (defined as the Metropolitan Argand Burner No. 2, or any other burner which the Board of Trade may approve), and prescribed the conditions and methods of testing with the standard burner. Two similar Bills, promoted by other Companies, were also introduced, and a conference was held of Local Authorities in whose districts the Companies supply gas. The conference decided to oppose the Bills in question, but this Council decided to be separately represented against the No. 1 Bill, and they accordingly petitioned against the Bill with the view of obtaining the insertion of provisions with respect to the testing of the •calorific power of the gas supplied by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company, and providing for the transfer of the Con. pany from the jurisdiction of this Council to that of the London County Council for the purposes of testing gas, the County Council being the authority for other Metropolitan Gas Companies. Both the Wandsworth and Putney and Brentford Gas Companies consequently withdrew from the Bill, which has now passed. 41. This Bill provided for the transfer of the management of Crystal Palace. the Crystal Palace from the present Board of Directors to a Hoard of Directors, consisting or a Chairman appointed by the Board of Trade, and eight other 72 REFUNDS. 131.

General Report on Testings of Gas supplied to the Wandsworth Borough Council (1) by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company; (2) by the Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company for the year ended 31ST March, 1910. Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company. The mode of testing- the gas has been the same as since 1st July, 1907, that is in accordance with instructions which I received from the Wandsworth Borough Council to test the gas twice weekly instead of daily, with such extra tests as might seem desirable or necessary. The monthly averages of illuminating power and sulphur given in Table I., and the curves in Table III. of this report, indicating the fluctuations throughout the year ended 31st March, 1910, are, therefore, based on the results of bi- or tri-weekly testings of the gas. Illuminating Power. By inspection of Table I. it will be seen that the average illuminating power of the gas for the whole year was 14.8 candles the statutory limit being 14.0 candles. Previous yearly averages have been 1903-1906, 15*4; 1907, 14.7; 1908 and 1909, 14.9 candles. During the year ended 31st March, 1910, the monthly averages have varied between a maximum of 15.2 candles (May, 1909) and a minimum of 14.5 candles (January, 1910)—see Table I., while the weekly averages have varied between a maximum of 15.6 candles (May, 1909) and minima of 14.3 candles (December, 1909, January and March, 1910)—see Table III. In no instance have I found the illuminating power below the statutory limit during the year. Sulphur The average number of grains of sulphur in 100 cubic feet of gas was 24.0 for the whole year, there being no statutory limit in connection with this impurity since the passing of the Removal of Sulphur Restrictions Act, July 20th, 1906. Up to that date, and calculating from monthly 135 averages since October, 1903, the total average for that period was i5'4 grains of sulphur in 100 cubic feet of gas. Although the average is now considerably higher than formerly, and has risen to over 30 grains on various occasions, it is rather less than that of the previous year (29.5 grains), and compares favourably with that of the Metropolitan Gas Companies on the whole during the same period. Should it not exceed the present average in future testings, the condition may be regarded, as satisfactory. Pressure. Since the year ended 31st March, 1908, in which year some exceptionally hig-h pressures were noted, and in connection with which I presented a report on January 1st, 1908, the pressures recorded at the times of testing have not been excessive, having varied between 2'5 and 3'o inches, that is to say, pressures which will sustain a column of water of those heights. Sulphuretted Hydrogen. I have not found this impurity in the gas at any testing during the year. On December 7th, 1909, I received a letter from the Town Recent Clerk, calling my attention to the promotion of the Legislation. Qas Companies (Standard Burner) Bill, in which the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company, and the Brentford Gas Company, proposed to join. I later received a copy of the Bill, and presented a report on the same to the Wandsworth Borough Council, dated December 31st, 1909. In that report, while generally agreeing that no valid objection could be raised against the proposed adoption of a standard burner, I called attention to certain proposed details of testing not quite in accordance with the latest notification of the London Gas Referees, and especially to the importance of instituting a Calorific Power Standard in connection with the testing of the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company's gas. The Council decided to present a petition against the Bill, in connection with which I confetred with Mr. Hills, with Mr. Young, the solicitor to the Council, and also with Mr. Coste, of the London County Council. I also attended a Conference 011 the Bill of Local Authorities at the Westminster Palace Hotel. 1 136 I was sorry eventually to learn from Mr. Young, in a letter dated 30th March, 1910, that the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company had withdrawn from the Bill, and the matter, therefore, dropped. Miteham and Wimbledon Gas Company. I have tested this Company's gas as usual at the testing-place at Haydon's Road, South Wimbledon, which was first opened on January 1st, 1908, and 1 have given, in Table II. of this report, a complete record of the testings made during the year ended 31st March, 1910, in connection with which I may add the following remarks:— Illuminating Power. As usual the illuminating power has shown a fairly high average, viz., 16.1 candles, the statutory limit being It hag varied between a maximum of 17.0 candles (June 5th, 1909) and a minimum of 15.1 candles (November 19th, 1909). Pressure The pressure, which is mostly rather higher than that of the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company, has varied between 2.5 and 4.0 inches, with a general average of 3.4 inches. Sulphuretted Hydrogen. I have not found this impurity present at any testing during the year ended 31st March, 1910. H. Wilson Hake, Ph.D., Gas Examiner. 137 TABLE I .

No personal investigations were made outside the Borough. Classification. The Sub-Committee considered the completed Record Papers and classified the applications into four divisions: Preference, Eligible, Ineligible, and Disqualified. In recommending applicants to the Central Body as suitable for employment, migration, or emigration, the Sub-Committee gave preference to men of good character, and distinguished as far as possible, between the habitual "out of work," and the applicant who was unemployed through trade depression, or kindred causes. Payment of Wages. The wages of the men from this Borough employed on the Non-Colony Works were paid on Saturday morning at the office of the Committee; the week's work being from Monday morning to Friday night. The rate of wages was 6d. per hour, except in the case of men working in Royal Parks, the wages there being 3/10 per day, and full fares paid. Family allowance. The men sent to the Working Colonies receive 6d. per week, addition to their board and lodging, a weekly allowance being made to the family on the ing scale:—10s. to the wife,-2s. to the first child under 14, 15. 6d. for the second child under 14, and 15. for each other child under 14 years; but in no case was 17/6 to be exceeded. The allowances are paid at the homes of the men on Wednesdays. The men are allowed a furlough at the end of each month, their fares being paid for them. 180 Representatives of Wandsworth on the Central (Unemployed) Body for London. Rev. J. H.

Number of applicants given work who have been in receipt of Poor Law Relief during the qualifying period of twelve months—5. Effect of the provision of work. The effect produced upon those who obtained work, through the medium of the Distress Committee, varied according to the character of the applicant. In the case of those anxious to work and keep their homes together it was noticeable that after a week's wages, when nourishing food had been obtained, they gradually improved in efficiency. Advantages of Colony work. Colony work has the advantage of fresh air and healthy surroundings, and of removing men from many local temptations. For various reasons, a number of applicants have declined to leave their homes for any period, preferring to wait for local employment. Experience in administering the Act. In administering the Act, the Committee found reason to believe that a false impression was created amongst the unemployed, who, after having had the enquiry forms filled up and having received visits from the Investigators as to the correctness of the statements, felt that work was certain. As only 369 out of 1,424 applicants obtained work, the disappointed balance lost confidence in the usefulness of the Act, and to some extent also in those 189 administering it. The impression that work was coming also slackened their efforts to obtain employment elsewhere. The Committee has not availed itself of the services of Volunteers. additional voluntary workers. Preliminary investigation. The Committee had referred to them before investigation all cases where there appeared to be a technical disqualification, and if the applicant did not comply with the regulations issued by the Local Government Board no further action was taken. Applications from single men, and married men without families, were not investigated, unless the application was for Emigration. The foregoing remarks are the same in substance as those made last year. An additional year's experience confirms the opinions of the Committee then expressed. ALEX. GLEGG, Chairman.

This year the form in which the Report of the Libraries Committee has hitherto been presented has been changed. The statistics of the several libraries have been collated. They are now placed side by side in a form which makes comparison easy and instructive, and may possibly help towards uniformity of administration. The issue of books from all the libraries has largely increased. In every library the issues are the highest hitherto recorded. The figures in the Report of the Clapham Library Sub-Committee demonstrate the value of a good Reference Department where books can be consulted without being lent. There 22,982 books were consulted without being taken away. The marked increase in the number of Students' Tickets issued is gratifying. This increase shows a growing demand for books of an educational character. Consideration of the use made of the Reading Rooms, the Reference Departments, and the Lending Departments of the Borough Libraries shows how greatly and increasingly the public are enjoying the benefits of these institutions. It is a credit to municipal administration that advantages so extremely appreciated can be provided within the narrow limits of a penny rate. J. H. ANDERSON, Chairman. 12th August, 1910. 194 REPORT OF THE CLAPHAM PUBLIC LIBRARY SUB-COMMITTEE For the Year ended 31st March, 1910. The Sub-Committee have pleasure in presenting the TwentyThird Annual Report on the work of the Clapham Library. The number of books issued during the year was 136,604 in the Lending Library and 22,982 in the Reference Library, being a total issue of 159,586 volumes, and a daily average of 665 volumes for the 240 days on which the library was open. These figures are much higher than any hitherto recorded, and show an increase in issues of 28,110 volumes over the previous year, and a daily average increase of 126 volumes. The number of books now in stock is 18,659, of which 15,196 are in the Lending Library and 3,463 in the Reference Library. 4,337 readers' ordinary tickets (including renewals) and 1,102students' tickets were issued during the year. Advantage was taken of the publication of a new catalogue of works of fiction and juvenile literature in July, 1909, to withdraw a number of obsolete and worn-out books, to add duplicates of the more popular works, and to re-arrange and re-number the books in these classes in alphabetical order under authors. The Sub-Committee desire to express their cordial thanks to the various donors of books, periodicals, etc., during the past year. The principal donations were a number of books from Dr. H. R. Mosse and Mr. T. Browning, and a Roman altar stone, fouud in the grounds of Cavendish House, Clapham Common, and presented by Councillor E. J. Golds. 95 The Borough Council in November, 1909, appointed the Mayor (Alderman Dawnay, J.P.), Alderman Lidiard, and Councillors Bulcraig, J.P., Cox, Cundall, Duncan, Henderson, and Young, as the Sub-Committee for the Clapham Library for 1910. Councillor Cundall was elected chairman, and a vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Bulcraig for his services as chairman during the previous year. The Sub-Committee are pleased to record their appreciation of the satisfactory and efficient manner in which the Librarian and his Staff have discharged their duties. On behalf of the Sub-Committee, JAS. W. CUNDALL, Chairman. 2nd May, 1910. 196 REPORT OF THE PUTNEY LIBRARY SUB-COMMITTEE, For the Year ended 31st March, 1910. In presenting the Twenty-Second Annual Report of the Library the Sub-Committee have pleasure in stating that the Library continues to be extensively used in all departments. In December, 1909, Councillors Hoile, Jackson, Mathias, and Radford were appointed by the Borough Council to act as the Sub-Committee for the year 1910. Councillor Gosden was elected to the Sub-Committee in February, 1910. A second edition of the Catalogue Key to the Indicator has been issued, and is well used by borrowers from the Lending Department. During the year the following works have been carried out under the superintendence of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor:— Erection of new bookcases and additions to the directory stand at a cost of £38, and painting works, costing £16. The Electric Light Installation has been altered and improved transformers fixed and the use of metallic filament lamps introduced at a cost of £95. The result has proved highly successful, shewing a considerable reduction in the current used. The Sub-Committee desire to place on record their appreciation, of the valuable services of Mr. J. E. Parker, the Chairman of the Sub-Committee for the past two years, during the many years he was associated with the management of the Library. The estimates for the year 1910-11 have been reduced by in order to bring the sum to be expended within the amount of the estimated product of a penny rate in the Putney Ward. The Sub-Committee desire to thank the donors of various books and newspapers to the Library. 197 Lending Department. The stock in this department has increased by 759 volumes; of these, 736 were acquired by purchase, and 23 were presented. 284 obsolete volumes were withdrawn from stock, making a total of 11,291 volumes now available for the use of borrowers. The issues have increased by 1,723 volumes, the total number being 74,089 as compared with 72,366 issued during the year 1908-9. On March 31st 2,221 borrowers' tickets and 323 students' tickets were available for use in the department. The sum of £55 4s. 11d. was received from the sale of catalogues, fines, &c., during the year. Reference Department. The Reference Library is shelved in open cases, a plan greatly appreciated by readers. No record is kept of the number of books consulted, but it is estimated that upwards of 150 persons use the room daily. During the year 57 volumes have been added to the stock, making the total 2,407 volumes. Magazine Rooms. Forty monthly magazines and reviews, six quarterlies, and 31 weekly periodicals are placed in these rooms, which continue to be used by an increasing number of readers. The magazines and reviews are transferred to the Lending Department when replaced by new issues and are greatly in demand for home reading. News Room. The list of newspapers, &c., provided in this room includes 31 daily newspapers, among which are Birmingham, Cardiff, Dublin, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Manchester, and Plymouth daily journals, 55 weekly newspapers and periodicals, and 55 monthly and quarterly publications. The only change in the staff was the appointment of Will. J. Mills as a Junior Assistant, in March, 1910, in place of James C. Clarke, who was transferred to the Rating Department. The Sub-Committee again have much pleasure 111 recording their satisfaction with the work of the Librarian and his staff. Signed 011 behalf of the Putney Library Sub-Committee. A. W. MATHIAS, July, 1910. Chairman. 198 REPORT OF THE STREATHAM, BALHAM, AND TOOTING LIBRARIES SUB-COMMITTEE, For the Year ended 31st March, 1910. The Sub-Committee have pleasure in presenting their report on the work of the Streatham, Balham, and Tooting Libraries for the year ended March 31st, 1910. The large increase in the number of books borrowed for homereading is again a gratifying and noticeable feature of the year's work. The number of books issued at the three libraries reached a total of 455,007, or 38,674 more than that of last year. The circulation at each library (the highest hitherto recorded) was as follows:— Lending Library. For Reference Purposes. Total. Average Daily Issue. The Tate Library 185,948 6,120 192,068 800 Balham Library 156.539 2,642 159.18 663 Tooting Library 101,941 1,817 103,758 432 Total Number of Volumes issued 455,007 1,895 A detailed statement of the number of books issued in each class of literature will be found in the general table of statistics appended to this report, page 17. The classification in the tables has been slightly modified this year so that the returns pertaining to all the libraries in the Borough may be combined in one general table Though the statistical information given in the tables affords some indication of the extensive use and popularity of these libraries and of the work involved in their administration, yet, at the same time, it is impossible to indicate by means of figures alone that value and usefulness which depend so largely upon the judicious and satisfactory 199 provision that is made for meeting the requirements of all classes of readers. The Sub-Committee are glad to find that their aim in supplying a comprehensive selection of literature and technical books suited to the increasing needs of the numerous borrowers and students using the three libraries meets with general satisfaction. They regret, however, that owing to financial limitations they are prevented from extending as fully as they would like the scope and utility of their work. The number of Borrowers' Tickets issued at each library during the year was as follows:— Issued from No. of Tickets issued. Ordinary Tickets. Students' Tickets. Total. The Tate Library, Streatham 5,222 2,037 7,259 Balham Public Library 4.073 500 4,573 Tooting Public Library 2,680 884 3,564 Total 11,975 3,421 15,396 It is gratifying to find that the granting of Supplementary or Students' Tickets continues to be much appreciated by borrowers, as evinced by the large number issued during the past year. These tickets are not available for works of fiction or books in the Juvenile Department. The stock at the 31st March, after making the necessary deductions on account of replacements and discarded books, numbered 41,605 volumes, located as follows:— Volumes in Stock. The Tate Library, Streatham 20,090 Balham Public Library 12,866 Tooting Public Library 8,649 Total 41,605 n 200 More detailed information respecting the stock will be found in the general table appended to this report, page 16. In the acquisition of books careful consideration is always given to the requirements of every section of the libraries, and when, at times, it is fouud necessary to limit the additions, the Sub-Committee endeavour so to expend their funds that no class of literature is neglected from a want of due appreciation of its value and utility. The reading rooms have been well attended during the year. They are supplied with a large selection of the principal newspapers and periodicals, many being presented by their respective publishers or other donors. During the year 201 publications were provided at the Tate Library, 136 at the Balham Library, and 121 at the Tooting Library. A list of these papers, &c., is given on pages 18 to 27. The reading rooms are open on week-days from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., and on Sundays (except during the months of July, August, and September), from 3 to 9 p.m. The work of painting the exterior wood and iron-work of the Tate Library and sundry repairs connected with the building were carried out in the early part of the summer. A considerable saving in the cost of electric lightiug at the Tooting Library has been effected by the provision of a transformer and the substitution of metal filament lamps. The Sub Committee again have much pleasure in recording their satisfaction with the work of the Librarian and his Staff. Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee, A. DOUGLAS ROBINSON, Chairman. 30th May, 1910. 201 REPORT OF THE WANDSWORTH LIBRARIES SUB-COMMITTEE, For the Year ended 31st March, 1910. The Libraries Sub-Committee for the Parish of Wandsworth beg to report on the work of the Wandsworth Public Libraries for the 25th year of their existence. The members of the Council which form the Sub-Committee are: Councillor Couzens (Chairman), The Mayor, Alderman Lidiard, Councillors Everett, B.A., Evershed, Junr., Harrison, J. A. Robinson, and Shillington. Last year's issue was 153,095, and the present year's (1909-10) was 162,300, an increase of over 6 per cent. It may be noted, too, that the issues show a striking increase of 88 per cent. since the Council took over the libraries in 1901-2, whilst the population of the Parish of Wandsworth has only increased 61 per cent., thus indicating that the reading public has grown much larger. Having regard to the limited amount of money available for additions to the Wandsworth Libraries, it gives the Sub-Committee much satisfaction to find that the inhabitants of Wandsworth have so appreciated the care and attention paid to the selection of books that the issues have continued to increase. In accordance with an order of the Libraries Committee, the details of the statistics have been re-arranged. During the year two catalogues have been printed of the books in the lending department at the West Hill Library, in accordance with the rules passed by the Council on 25th March, 1908; 190 copies of the general and 415 copies of the fiction catalogues have been sold. Advantage was taken of the re-printing of the catalogue to discard the obsolete books and to add others of more modern date in their places. The advertisement boards have attracted great numbers of those interested in the requirements of the labour market, and during the year the Proprietors of the Daily Mail have presented two copies of 202 their paper, from which the advertisements are cut and exhibited on the notice boards the proprietors kindly supplied. This is in addition to the presentation of two copies of The Times and three copies of the Daily Telegraph recorded last year. The rooms over the Branch Library in Garratt Lane are now re-let to another tenant for three years. The outside of the library at West Hill has been re-painted. The Sub-Committee are glad to find that all their officers and servants (with the exception of two who are only on part time) have been placed on the permanent staff. The Sub-Committee are again indebted to many donors of books and newspapers. The Borough Engineer and Surveyor kindly gave the Sub-Committee an old boundary stone found in connection with the widening of High Street; it is placed in the forecourt of the West Hill Library, where it may be seen with the milestone (seventh from Royal Exchange) which formerly stood where Santos Road joins West Hill, also an old wooden water pipe dug up ill the town, and two of the stone sleepers of the Surrey Iron Railway. A hearty vote ot thanks was given to Councillor W. J. Harrison for his services in the chair during the past three years. Councillor Couzens was called to the chair for the ensuing year. There have been two changes in the staff, viz.:—Mr. H. E. Ilott was transferred to the Rating Department, and Mr. S. Bastin, from Streatham Library, was appointed in his place. Mr. L. E. Hull left the service of the Corporation to go to Canada, and Mr. E. Mendham has been transferred from Balham Library. The Sub-Committee desire to express their appreciation of the able and efficient way in which the Librarian and his Assistants have discharged their duties during the past year, also of the helpful assistance given by the Librarian to inquiring students and visitors generally.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1909. Population. The population of the Borough as estimated by the Registrar General was, in the middle of 1909, 297,646, an increase of 8,140 compared with 1908, but this estimate, in my opinion, is much under the actual population. The population on which all the rates in this Report are calculated has been obtained in a similar manner to that adopted in 1905, 1906, 1907, and 1908, by dividing the number of inhabitants at the Census, 1901, by the number of rated hereditaments in that year. The factor thus obtained represents the number of persons per rated hereditament, by which the number of hereditaments in the middle of 1909 is multiplied. 6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. It is probable, however, that this calculation gives a population somewhat in excess of the actual population, as the number of persons per rated hereditament may have decreased. The method adopted, in my opinion, gives the closest approximation to the actual population. The population for the purposes of the Equalisation of Rates Act was estimated in 1906 as 296,020, in 1907, 308,663, in 1908, 318,603, and in 1909, 327,322, these populations being calculated from the number of rated houses. Table I. shows the population of each Ward and the number of rated hereditaments in 1901, the number of hereditaments in the middle of 1909 and the estimated population. TABLE I. Ward.

Compared with 1908, the greatest increase in population occurred in Streatham, next in Wandsworth, and the smallest in Clapham. The corrected population in Table II. is used to calculate the rates in this Report. The difference between the corrected and uncorrected population is made up by the population in the Public Institutions of the Borough, which are as follows Clapham:—Hostel of God. Putney:—The Priory, Roehampton. Streatham:— St. Anne's Home. (St. Pancras parish.) Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). 8 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Tooting:—Tooting Home. Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals The Fountain and the Grove. Newlands Asylum. Tooting Bec Asylum. Wandsworth:—The Workhouse. Royal Hospital for Incurables. Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). H.M. Prison. The total population of these Institutions was about 6,300, but as a proportion of the inmates of the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals belong to this Borough, a deduction of 5,800 made from the uncorrected total population gives, approximately, the corrected population, viz.:—339,100, compared with 329,700 in 1908, 320,120 in 1907, and 310,310 in 1906. Births. During the 52 weeks ending the 1st January, 1910, 6,985 births, 3,553 of males and 3,432 of females, were registered, compared with 7,331 in 1908, 7,036 in 1907, 7,057 in 1906, and 6,892 in 1905. The total number of births registered in this Borough was 6,924, but 139 births occurred in Institutions outside the Borough of persons belonging to the Borough, and 78 births in Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging to the Borough, making a corrected total of 6,985. Of the 139 births which were registered outside the Borough, all occurred in Lying-in Institutions, 123 in Clapham Maternity, and the remainder in various Institutions in other parts of London. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 9 In Table III. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rate of natural increase for each sub-district, and for the whole Borough.

The rate for Putney is exceptionally low, being 2.21 under the rate for 1908, and 4 69 under the decennial average. The rate for Tooting is this year under the decennial average, but compared with the other sub-districts, Tooting has a high birth-rate. The rate for the whole Borough is much lower than any previously recorded, being 1.63 per 1,000 under 1908, and 2.34 under the decennial average. The birth-rate for the whole of London was 24 3 per 1,000, compared with 25.82 in 1908, and 27.76 the decennial average; 11 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. while for England and Walts this rate was 25.6 per 1,000, compared with 26.5 in 1908, and 27.82 the decennial average. With regard to this rate, although, as the Registrar General states in his Report for 1908, the crude birth-rate, i.e., the ratio of births to population at all ages, is valuable for comparing the rates from year to year, or for ascertaining the rate of natural increase, yet it is not of great value for any inquiry into the significance of the variations which occur over a period of years, on account of the changing constitution of the population, or for comparing the rate in different communities, on account of the differences in age and sex distribution. It is necessary therefore to calculate the proportion of births to the number of possible mothers, or the total number of females living in the Borough at ages 15 to 45 years. In the year 1901 this rate was 88.6 per 1,000, in 1907, 74, in 1908, 73, and in 1909, only 69.4; while for England and Wales the rates were, in 1901, 114.2, and in 1908, 106.1. The legitimate birth-rate, calculated on the married female population was in 1901, 215 per 1,000, in 1908, 174, and in 1909, 165; while for England and Wales it was, in 1901, 234.2, and in 1908, 217.6. The low rates in this Borough are due to the greater proportion of females, both married and unmarried, at ages 15-45, compared with the whole of England and Wales, and also to the lower birth-rate. Although these rates are, owing to the lapse of time since the last Census, only approximately correct, yet there is no doubt that a very serious reduction has taken place in the birth-rate during the last 10 years. 184 births occurred in the Workhouse during the year and one in the Middlesex County Asylum. Of the births in the Workhouse 12 belonged to Clapham, eight to Putney, 21 to Streatham, nine to Tooting, 57 to Wandsworth, 67 to Battersea, and 10 to other places, 12 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of these 184 births 103 were illegitimate, eight belonging to Clapham, seven to Putney, 15 to Streatham, four to Tooting, 25 to Wandsworth, 35 to Battersea, and nine to other places. In the Borough, excluding the Workhouse, 116 illegitimate births occurred, 30 in Clapham, 10 in Putney, 26 in Streatham, 23 in Tooting, and 27 in Wandsworth. One illegitimate birth occurred in the Middlesex County Asylum. 4 The total number of illegitimate births was 175, 38 of which belonged to Clapham, 17 to Putney, 41 to Streatham, 27 to Tooting, and 52 to Wandsworth, compared with 177 in 1908, and 189 in 1907. The percentage of illegitimate births to total births was 2.50, compared with 2.41 in 1908, 2.68 in 1907, and 3.5 for the whole of London for 1908. The following Table shows the percentage of illegitimate births to total births for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year, and for the three previous years. 1906. 1907. 1908 1909. Clapham 3.0 2.7 2.45 3.58 Putney 1.6 2.8 3.42 3.41 Streatham 2.8 2.5 2.08 2.24 Tooting 3.7 3.2 2.88 2.65 Wandsworth 2.8 2.5 2.20 2.25 Whole Borough 2.87 2.68 2.41 2.50 The illegitimate birth-rate in proportion to total births in this Borough is considerably lower than that for England and Wales, which was, in the five years 1896-1900, 4.10 per cent., in 1901-1905, 3.95 per cent., and in 1908, 3.99 per cent 13 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Deaths. During the 52 weeks ending the 1st January, 1910, 3,279 deaths, 1,589 of males and 1,690 of females were registered, compared with 3,230 in 1908, 3,337 in 1907, and 3,341 in 1906. Compared with 1908 there has been an increase of 49 deaths, but a decrease of 885 compared with the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The uncorrected death-rate for the Borough was 9 50 per 1,000, compared with 9.63 in 1908, 10.24 in 1907, and 10.57 in 1906. The average uncorrected rate for the decennium 1899-1908 was 11.76, or 2.26 above the rate for the year 1909. In the sub-districts Streatham had much the lowest rate, viz.:—7.17, and Tooting the highest, viz. :—23.53. The reason for the high rate in Tooting is that in that subdistrict there are a number of Public Institutions, as the Tooting Bee Asylum and the Tooting Home, where persons from other parts of London are received and among whom the mortality is very great. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in Out-lying Institutions of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, whose domiciles were in other parts of London. The total number of deaths for the 52 weeks, corrected for both internal and external Institutions was 3,520, compared with 3,380 in 1908, 3,416 in 1907, 3,461 in 1906, 3,320 in 1905, 3,417 in 1904, 3,023 in 1903, 3,328 in 1902, 3,130 in 1901, and 4,175 the decennial average corrected for increase of population, 14 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the year 745 deaths occurred in Public Institutions and 92 in other places not institutions in the Borough. Of these 837,656 deaths were of persons not belonging and 181 of persons belonging to the Borough. Table V. shows the total number of Institution deaths arranged according to sub-districts and Institutions in which they occurred, Table VI. the deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough, and Table VII. of persons belonging thereto arranged according to causes of death, sex and age, and Institution in which the death occurred.

In the Middlesex County Asylum the deaths were five more, in the Tooting Bee Asylum 34 more, in the Hostel of God 19 less, in the Tooting Home 18 less, in the Fever Hospitals 42 less, in the Workhouse 45 more, in the Prison one more, in the Royal Hospital for Incurables two more, in St. Anne's Home four more, in The Priory two more, and in other places five more, compared with the year 1908. Of the deaths in other places not Public Institutions 14 occurred in Clapham, 17 in Putney, 38 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 14 in Wandsworth. Table VI. shows the deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, arranged as to ages, causes of death, and Institution in which the death occurred. The greatest number of deaths was due to Old Age, and of the 172 registered, 123 occurred in Tooting Bee Asylum, 28 in the Tooting Home, and 10 in the Middlesex County Asylum. In the Middlesex County Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Old Age, disease of the Respiratory Organs, Bright's disease, and all other causes, which include all diseases of the nervous system. In Tooting Bee Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, diseases of the Respiratory Organs, Old Age, Bright's disease, Cancer, and all other causes; in the Hostel of God from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and Cancer; and in the Tooting Home from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Old Age, and all other causes. In the Fever Hospitals 18 deaths occurred from Scarlet Fever, compared with 46 in 1908, 28 from Diphtheria, compared with 27, and one from Lobar Pneumonia. 16 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

As the Borough is dealt with as one Sanitary District the deaths of persons belonging to other parishes in the Borough in Institutions such as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting, are considered to be deaths in Internal Institutions with regard to the whole Borough, and are not included in the following Tables. The same applies to deaths in the Hostel of God, Clapham, the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, the Tooting Bee Asylum, and the Royal Hospital for Incurables. 20 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Of the 447 deaths in General and Special Hospitals, 77 occurred in St. Thomas's Hospital, 40 in Bolingbroke Hospital, seven in Belgrave Hospital, 14 in Victoria Hospital, seven in St. George's Hospital, 23 in Westminster Hospital, 11 in Guy's Hospital, 22 in Long Grove Asylum, it in Horton Asylum, 15 in Banstead Asylum, 18 in Charing- Cross Hospital, 13 in Cane Hill Asylum, nine in Middlesex Hospital, and 11 in West London Hospital. In the South Western Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, there were 14 deaths, one from Scarlet Fever, three from Diphtheria, four from Diarrhoea, two from Enteric Fever, and four from other causes. The number of deaths in these and other Institutions outside the Borough is shown on Table XII. The corrected number of deaths after adding the deaths of persons belonging- to the Borough and subtracting those of persons dying- in the Borough and not belonging thereto, was 3,520, 1,723 of males and 1,797 females, an increase of 148 compared with 1908, but a decrease of 655 compared with the corrected decennial average. The corrected death-rate for the year was 10.38, compared with 10.25 in 1908, 10.67 in 1907, 11.15 in 1906, 11.61 in 1905, 12.93 in 1904, 12.24 in 1903, 13.43 in 1902, and 15.33 in 1901. c 22 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Table IX. shows the total number of deaths and the deathrates for each sub-district and for the whole Borough, corrected and uncorrected for deaths in Public Institutions. The death-rate for the whole of London for the year was 13.99 Per 1,000, compared with 14.75 in 1908, 14.55 in 1907, 15.07 in 1906, 15.1 in 1905, 16.10 in 1904, 15.6 in 1903, and 17.2 in 1902. 23 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The death-rate in England and Wales in 1909 was 14.5 per 1,000, compared with 14 7 in 1908, 15.0 in 1907, 15.4 in 1906, 16.2 in 1905, and 16.2 in 1904; in the 76 Great Towns 14.7, compared with 14.9 in 1908; and in the 143 Smaller Towns 13.9, compared with 140. If a comparison is to be made with other places it is necessary to again correct the corrected rate, viz.:-10.38, for age and sex distribution. This is done by multiplying the rate by a factor obtained by dividing the standard death-rate in England and Wales, at the Census of 1901, with the standard death-rate for the Borough at the same period. This factor has been ascertained to be 10547, which gives a rate for this Borough for the year 1909 of 10.94 per 1,000, compared with 10.81 in 1908, 11.25 in 1907, 11.76 in 1906, 12.24 in 1905, 13.6o in 1904, 12.87 in 1903, and 14 00 in 1902. The following Table shows the standard death-rate, the factor for correction, the crude death-rate, the corrected death-rate, and the comparative mortality figure for London and for the 29 Boroughs, including the City of London, for the year 1909. The figures are extracted from the Quarterly Returns of the Registrar General for the year. 25 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE X. AREA. Standard Death-rate. Factor for Correction.

In the separate sub-districts of the Borough the corrected death-rate was 8.89 in Streatham, 10.28 in Putney, 1084 in Wandsworth, 11.01 in Clapham, and 12.60 in Tooting. The rates for Clapham, Putney, Tooting and Wandsworth were higher than in 1908, while that for Streatham was lower. The increase in the rate for the whole Borough was very small, being only 13 per 1,000, and was due to the great mortality in the first quarter of the year from Diseases of the Respiratory Organs caused by the severe climatic conditions. The rates in this Table do not agree with the rates in Table XI., as the rates in the latter Table are calculated on the total population without deducting the population of non-parishioners in Public Institutions in the Borough. The first Chart shows the death-rate in the Borough for each fortnight compared with the average for the quinquennial 19041908. The Chart shows that only 011 four occasions was the fortnightly rate above the rate for the five years 1904-1908, viz. :—011 the fortnight ending the 27th February, the fortnights ending the 13th and 27th March, and the fortnight ending the 10th April. In all the other months of the year the rate was below the average, and this was specially the case in July, August and September. The highest rate, 19.58, occurred in the fortnight ending the 13th March, while the lowest rate, viz. :—7.24, occurred in the fortnight ending the 31st July. The next Chart shows the annual death-rate per 1,000 during each week of the year for the whole of London, and for each fortnight for the Borough of Wandsworth. During the whole year the rate for this Borough was considerably under the rate for the whole of London. The highest rate in London was in the second and third week of March, and the lowest in the fourth week of July. The rates both in the Borough and in London only increased slightly in the months of August and September as the mortality from Diarrhoea again wag less severe, CHART Showing the Annual Death-rate during each fortnight of the year 1909, and of the Quinquennium 1904-1908 for the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth.

Death- rate for London shown in Black Death-rate for Wandsworth shown in Bed. 27 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The high rate in London in March was clue to the very great mortality from diseases of the Respiratory Organs and Influenza. The four Tables which follow are inserted by order of the Local Government Hoard. Table I. shows the births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate per 1,000 for the whole Borough for the year, and the 10 preceding years; the total deaths of children under one year of age is also given, and the rate per 1,000 births registered. In this Table column five gives the corrected number of deaths under one year, as the uncorrected number, viz. :—512, would not give the true rate of infantile mortality. Table II. shows the population, the number of births and deaths registered, and the number of deaths under one year of age, for the whole Borough, as well as for the various subdistricts. It also shows these for each year since 1899, and is to a large extent a complete history of the mortality of the Borough for the last 10 years. Table III. shows the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year at all ages and at certain age periods in the Borough and in the several sub-districts, and also shows the number of cases removed from each sub-district to hospital. Table IV. is the General Mortality Table for the whole Borough, showing the number of deaths at all ages, arranged as to cause of death. This also shows the total number of deaths in each sub-district, and the number of deaths in Public Institutions in the district, both of residents and non-residents. 28 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Ages at Death. The following Table shows the percentage of deaths to total deaths at six age periods for each sub-district and for the whole Borough. TABLE XVI. Sub-Districts.

There was a considerable diversity in these rates in the different sub-districts. In Putney the rate under one year was only 13.27, while in Tooting it was 24.75, while over 65 years of age Tooting had a rate of i9'8i and Streatham of 37.01. Again, at from one to five years the rate was still high in Tooting and low in Streatham, and also at ages five to 15, while at ages 15 to 25, 25 to 65, and over 65 the Tooting rates were much lower and were the lowest of the five sub-districts. 34 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. These differences are due to the different age and sex constitution of the separate sub-districts, as well as to the differences in social conditions. Infantile Mortality. The total number of deaths of infants under one year was 601, compared with 720 in 1908, 715 in 1907, 874 in 1906, 818 in 1905, 851 in 1904, and 743 in 1903. Of these, 112 occurred in Clapham, 43 in Putney, 133 in Streatham, 100 in Tooting, and 213 in Wandsworth. The infantile mortality, or deaths under one year to. 1,000 births was 86, compared with 98 in 1908, 101 in 1907, 125 in 1906, 118 in 1905, 123 in 1904, and 110 in 1903. This rate was 83 in Clapham, compared with 98 in 1908 and 119 the decennial average; 86 in Putney, compared with 97 and 122; 73 in Streatham, compared with 80 and 108; 98 in Tooting, compared with 122 and 152; and 89 in Wandsworth, compared with 101 and 126. In the whole Borough the rate was no less than 12 per 1,000 births under that for 1908, and 36 under the decennial average. The rate in 1909 was much lower than any rate ever recorded, and in each sub-district it shows a marked diminution as compared with the decennial average, in Tooting showing a difference of 54, in Wandsworth of 37, in Clapham and Putney 36, and in Streatham 35 per 1,000, compared with that average. The following Table shows the number of deaths, the percentage to total deaths, the rate per 1,000 births for the year and for the three previous years for each sub-district and for the whole Borough. 35 tieport of the Mcdical Officer of Health.

Table XXVI. shows approximately the proportion of deaths per 1,000 births for each week under one month, and for each month up to 12 months from five groups of diseases. Compared with 1908 the rate from common infectious diseases is higher, due to the increase in the number of deaths from Measles and Whooping Cough. There has, however, been a very large reduction in the rate from Diarrhoeal diseases, the rate having been only 13.15, compared with 20.72. From Wasting diseases, Tuberculous diseases and other causes there has also been a slight decrease compared with 1908. Compared with the rate for England and Wales for 1908, the rate for the common infectious diseases was 7.41 per 1,000 in England and Wales and 7.07 in Wandsworth, from Diarrhoeal diseases 19*90 in England and Wales and 13.15 in Wandsworth, from Wasting diseases 42.37 in England and Wales and 35.18 in Wandsworth, from Tuberculous diseases 4.65 in England and Wales and 2.43 in Wandsworth, and from other causes 46.10 in England and Wales and 28.17 in Wandsworth. The total rate per 1,000 births was 120 in England and Wales and in Wandsworth 98 for 1908, while the rate in Wandsworth for 1909 was only 86, by far the lowest rate ever recorded. Compared with the rate in England and Wales for the five years 1903-1907 the rate in this Borough was, from the common infectious diseases 1.21 lower, from Diarrhceal diseases 9.42 lower, from Wasting diseases 8.65 lower, from Tuberculous diseases 2.93 lower, from other causes 22.9 lower, and from all causes 45.11 per 1,000 births lower. The rate for 1909 compares more favourably even than in 1908 with the rate for England and Wales for the five years 1903-1907. In the Table it will also be seen that the rate from the common infectious diseases was highest at 10 to 11 months, from Diarrhceal diseases at three to four months, from Wasting diseases under one month, from Tuberculous diseases at five to six and 11 to 12 months, and from other causes at one to two months. 47 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. From all causes the rate was highest under one week and lowest at ii to 12 months. Table XXVII. shows the infantile mortality per 1,000 births from all causes and from certain causes for the whole Borough and for each sub-district. From Premature Birth the rate was lowest in Tooting and highest in Clapham, from Developmental diseases highest in Putney and lowest in Streatham, from Diarrhceal diseases highest in Tooting and lowest in Putney, from Measles and Whooping Cough highest in Wandsworth and lowest in Tooting, from Respiratory diseases highest in Tooting and lowest in Putney, from Tubercular diseases highest in Streatham and lowest in Clapham, and from other causes highest in Putney and lowest in Clapham. An examination of all the Tables dealing with infantile mortality and especially with Table XVIII., which gives the rates for the year and for the decennium 1899-1908, shows that in no year has this mortality been so low. In Tooting, which had during the decennium a rate of 152 per 1,000, the rate was only 98 in 1909, and this is lower than the rate in any of the other sub-districts during that decennium. To put this in another way : if the rate during the year 1909 had been equal to the rate in the previous decennium then the number of deaths would have been 852, or 251 more. This enormous saving of infant life has been the result of various agencies which have been at work in the Borough. First the climatic conditions were unfavourable for the production of Diarrhoea and other digestive troubles in infants. The temperature remained low till the first fortnight in August, and there was more than the average amount of rain and less than the average amount of sunshine. This weather was inimical to fly life, and in every part of the Borough it was noticed that the number of house-flies was less than usual. 48 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the second place the reduction was caused by the better sanitary condition of yards in rear of houses, and the greater attention paid to the removal of deposits from these yards, as well as to the improvement in dust-bin arrangements and the removal of house refuse. Last but not least a considerable amount of the reduction has. been due to the work of the female inspectors, the educational value of whose visits cannot be over estimated. Some of the results of their work is shown later on in this Report, but it is impossible to give statistics of the educational! value of the work which I am satisfied has been very great. 49 ■WIV3H lo V°3}V3W am fo jao43}[ TABLE XXVII.

Compared with 1908 there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Puerperal Fever, Erysipelas, Measles, Whooping Cough, Influenza, and other Septic diseases, and a decrease in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Continued Fever, and Diarrha. 51 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been an increase in the number of deaths from other Continued Fevers, Puerperal Fever, Measles, and other Septic diseases, and a decrease in Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Erysipelas, Whooping Cough, Influenza, and Diarrhoea. From all Zymotic diseases the death-rate was 1.47 per 1,000 (1.23 in Clapham, .85 in Putney, .87 in Streatham, 1.87 in Tooting, and 1.33 in Wandsworth), compared with 114 in 1908, 1.34 in 1907, 1.70 in 1906, 1.57 in 1905, 1.93 in 1904, and 1.8o the decennial average. The rate from the principal Zymotic diseases, viz. :—Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Diarrhoea, was .81 per 1,000 (.88 in Clapham, .47 in Putney, .48 in Streatham, 1.43 in Tooting, and 1.02 in Wandsworth), compared with .82 in 1908, .97 in 1907, 1.36 in 1906, 1.30 in 1905, 1.60 in 1904. The rate in London was 1.30 per 1,000, compared with 1 '37 in 1908, 1.37 in 1907, 1.94 in 1906, 1.68 in 1905, and 2.14 in 1904. The rate for England and Wales was 1.12, compared with 1.29 in 1908; in the 76 Great Towns 142, compared with 159, in the 143 Smaller Towns ro8, compared with i'26; and in Rural. England and Wales '80, compared with .99. • In out-lying Institutions 96 deaths occurred from Zymotic diseases (21 belonging to Clapham, four to Putney, 16 to Streatham, 13 to Tooting, and 42 to Wandsworth), compared with 54 in 1908, 48 in 1907, 52 in 1906, 67 in 1905, and 58 in 1904. m Of these deaths 68 occurred in Workhouse Infirmaries, 27 from Measles, three from Influenza, 24 from Whooping Cough,, three from Diarrhoea, four from Erysipelas, four from Puerperal Fever, and three from other Septic diseases; 12 in General and' Special Hospitals, two from Influenza, three from Diphtheria, one from Diarrhoea, one from Enteric Fever, one from Puerperal Fever,, and four from other Septic diseases; six in Public Lunatic Asylums, two from Diarrhoea and four from Influenza; and 10 in 52 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, one from Scarlet Fever, three from Diphtheria, two from Enteric Fever, and four from Diarrhoea. In Institutions in the Borough 57 deaths from Zymotic diseases occurred of persons not belonging thereto, compared with 82 in 1908, 106 in 1907, 90 in 1906, and 89 in 1905. The decrease in 1909 is due to the decrease in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever. Of these deaths 46 occurred in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at Tooting, 18 from Scarlet Fever, and 28 from Diphtheria. Six deaths from Measles occurred in the Workhouse, two deaths from Influenza in the Middlesex County Asylum, one from Erysipelas in the Tooting Bee Asylum, and one from other Septic diseases in the Hostel of God.

This is a decided decrease compared with the five previous years. 59 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births registered in the Borough, and in the vaccination sub-districts for the year 1908, as well as for the 10 years 18981907. The average for the 10 years is also shown on this Table. Compared with 1907 there has been a decrease in the percentage of successfully vaccinated in all the sub-districts with the exception of Putney. The greatest decrease occurrcd in Streatham, next in Clapham, and the smallest in Wandsworth, while in the whole Borough there has been a decrease of 8'8 per cent., or nearly double the decrease in 1907. Compared with the decennial average there has been a considerable increase in Putney, but a decrease in all the other subdistricts. 481 infants died unvaccinated, a percentage of 6 7, compared with 6.6 in 1907, 8.1 in 1906, 8.4 in 1905, and 8.6 in 1904. Of the 2,304 infants remaining, 25 or .34 per cent. were stated to have been insusceptible to vaccination; 581 or 8.0 per cent. in respect of whom certificates of conscientious objection were received; 376 or 5.2 per cent. had vaccination postponed by medical certificate, leaving 978 or 13 6 per cent. as removed, not to be traced, or otherwise unaccounted for; while 344 or 4.8 per cent. remained on the books as unvaccinated, compared with 13.4 per cent. as removed, etc., in 1907, 10.1 in 1906, and 7.7 in 1905; and 4.4 remaining as unvaccinated in 1907, 3.1 in 1906, and 3.1 in 1905. There has been an increase of '2 in the percentage of cases removed, and of 3'9 per cent. in the number of certificates of conscientious objections received. If the total number of infants who died unvaccinated be deducted from the total number of births registered, then of 6,721 the remaining infants, 65 7 per cent. were successfully vaccinated, compared with 71.2 in 1907, 78.1 in 1906, 81.5 in 1905, and 8o.5 in 1904; .37 were insusceptible, compared with .41, .23, .3 and .48; 5.6 per cent. were under certificate of postponement, compared 6o Report of the Medical Officer of Health. with 4.8, 5.1, 4.2 and 3.4; 8.6 per cent. in regard to whom certificates of conscientious objection had been obtained, compared with4.4, 2.8, 2.2 and 2.1; leaving 19.7 per cent. unaccounted for as regards vaccination, compared with 19.1, 14.5, 11.8 and 13.1.

Fortunately during the year Small-pox has been almost absent from London, but if the number of unprotected increases as rapidly as it has been doing during the last three years, imported cases, which will in the course of time be introduced, will have a greater number of unprotected to infect, resulting in serious loss to the community both financially and otherwise. The percentage of children not finally accounted for, including cases postponed, to total births during the last 10 years wasas follows for this Borough, for the Metropolis and for the rest of England. 6r Report of the Medical Officer of Health.  1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 Wandsworth 17.7 15.6 15.0 15.7 15.9 15.3 14.6 18.0 22.4 23.4 Metropolis ... 27.7 25.8 24.1 21.3 20.7 19.1 18.9 21.2 22.7 ...

The above percentages do not include those children with respect to which conscientious objection certificates were received, and if this be added it makes the percentage of unvaccinated children in the Borough 31.4, a very large increase compared with former years. Scarlet Fever. 987 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, compared with 1,232 in 1908, 1,330 in 1907, 1,069 in 1906, and 1,494 in 1905. 189 of these were in Clapham, 39 in Putney, 360 in Streatham, 126 in Tooting, and 273 in Wandsworth. 810 or 82 per cent. of these cases were removed to the hospital where 13 died, and 177 or 18 per cent, were treated at home with one death. The total number of deaths was 14, of which four were in Clapham, none in Putney, five in Streatham, two in Tooting, and three in Wandsworth. The percentage of cases removed to hospital, viz.: 82, is lower than in 1908, which was the highest recorded. In 1907, 84.8 per cent, were removed; in 1906, 83.8; in 1905, 84.1 ; in 1904,. 81.6; in 1903, 78.1; in 1902, 75; and in 1901, 706 per cent. "62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The case mortality was 1.42 per cent., compared with 1.7 in 1908, 1.65 in 1907, 1.78 in 1906, 1.87 in 1905, and 174 in 1904. The mortality among cases removed to hospital was 1.6 per cent., compared with 1.77 in 1908, and among those treated at home .57, compared with 1.25 in 1908. The mortality among the home treated cases is much lower than among those cases treated in hospital, while in 1908 the rates were respectively 1.77 and 1.25. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 2 88, compared with 3.67 in 1908, 4.08 in 1907, 3.4 in 1906, 5.1 in 1905, and 2.8 in 1904, and in the County of London 3.56, compared with 4 60, 5.53, 4.3, 41, and 2.89. The proportion of cases notified was thus .68 per 1,000 lower in this Borough than for the whole of London, while in 1908 it was .93 per 1,000 lower. The following Table shows the rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year and the three previous years, as well as the corresponding rates for the whole of London.

In Clapham the greatest number of cases was notified in May, and the smallest in February and August. There was again a decrease in the number of cases in Putney in 1909, compared with 1908, 39 cases having been notified, compared with 66. The greatest number was notified in July, viz.; nine, while no cases were notified in November. In Streatham the total number of cases was 90 more than in 1908. The maximum number of cases was notified in January and the minimum in August. In Tooting, although the number of cases notified per 1,000 of population is still high, yet compared with the previous year there has been a marked reduction. In 1907, 318 cases were notified, 47 of these occurring in Institutions, in 1908, 218, 21 in Institutions; and in 1909 only 126, 38 of which were in Institutions, were notified. In this sub-district the rate of notified cases per 1,000 of population was 3.68, compared with 6.52 in 1908, and if the cases in Institutions are deducted, 2.74, compared with 6.3. The maximum number of cases in Tooting occurred in February, and the minimum in September. In Wandsworth there was a large reduction in the number of cases notified, the rate per 1,000 having fallen from 4 45 to 2.66, and it is also lower than the rates in 1906 and 1907. The maximum number of cases occurred in February, and the minimum in December. In the Borough the maximum number of cases was notified in January, and the minimum in August. 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the number of cases notified in each sub-district during each month of the year 1909, and for the whole year. TABLE XXX VI. SubDistricts. January. February. March. April.

"I have to report the occurrence of 13 cases of Scarlet Fever in the sub-district of Wandsworth which has been definitely traced to milk supply. The outbreak was very slight, and the measures which were immediately taken had the effect of checking the outbreak as far as this district is concerned. "On the 17th inst. I received a notification of a case of Scarlet Fever in Ouinton Street, and on the 18th five cases were notified in the same neighbourhood. On that day the Inspector, on my instructions, at once investigated the cases notified, and reported to me in the forenoon of that day that all the cases were supplied by one milkman in Garratt Lane. I at once visited the milkman's premises and advised the immediate stopping of the milk supply until more detailed 65 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. inquiries could be made. Three notifications were received on the 19th, and four on the 21st. With the exception of two on the 21 st, all were supplied by the same purveyor in this district, the two last, however, being supplied by another milkman. Further inquiries showed that both these milkmen derived their supply from the same source. Both premises in this district were satisfactory, but at one of them there were no means of sterilizing the utensils, and 1 instructed the proprietor to send these utensils to the Disinfecting Station at Tooting-, where they were thoroughly sterilized. "In all the cases the first symptoms of the disease appeared from the 15th to the 18th, but in one case which occurred outside the district supplied by the purveyor, but where the child had visited a house supplied by him and had some milk on the 13th, the first symptoms were stated to have occurred on the 18th, showing that the period of incubation had been five days. "The medical men in the neighbourhood were at once communicated with and informed of the fact that a certain milk supply was infected. "I communicated with the London County Council to ascertain if any other districts in London were infected, and I was informed that the City of Westminster and the Borough of Chelsea had reported a number of cases in which the same milk supply was involved. I also ascertained that a number of places in the County of Surrey, whose milk supply was from the same source, were infected, and that in the Borough of Kingston alone over 170 cases had been notified. The Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council informed me that they would at once institute inquiries in the localities from which the milk was sent. These inquiries showed that at the farm some cases of Scarlet Fever had occurred, and that the authorities who were dealing with the outbreak were of opinion that these cases were the cause of the outbreaks which had occurred. "As the infected supply has now been stopped I am of opinion that so far as this Borough is concerned the outbreak is at an end. 66 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "All the cases have been removed to hospital and the premises disinfected." In this outbreak upwards of 400 cases occurred in the Boroughs and districts affected, and careful inquiry was made by the Medical Officers of the London County Council, and also of the Surrey County Council, in whose district the farm from which the infected supply was derived, is situated. As was stated in that report, there are two hypothesis as to the infection of the milk, one that it had been infected from human beings, and the other from some condition of the cow or cows. The investigation failed to prove the former, but it did not prove the latter, although it showed the probability that a diseased' condition of the cow was responsible for the outbreak. The death-rate was only 04 per 1,000, compared with .06 irk 1908, and with .08 for the whole of London. Scarlet Fever and Schools. The next Table shows the number of cases of Scarlet Fever for each month of the year among children in attendance at elementary and other schools for each sub-district, also the number for the whole Borough, the number of cases among persons not at school, the number attending schools outside the Borough, as well as the number of cases in which, as far as could be ascertained, the diagnosis of Scarlet Fever was incorrect. Of the total number of cases, viz.:—987, the diagnosis was incorrect in 52 or 5'2 per cent.; 510 or 51.7 per cent. were in attendance at schools in the Borough; 37 or 3.7 per cent. attended schools outside the Borough; while 388 or 39.3 per cent. did not attend school, being either above or under school age. The percentage of children attending school was as follows: in Clapham, 116 out of 189, or 61 per cent. were at school; ire 67 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Putney, 12 out of 39, or 31 per cent.; in Streatham, 201 out of 360,. or 55 per cent.; in Tooting-, 50 out of 88, or 57 per cent.; and in Wandsworth, 131 out of 273, or 48 per cent. The percentage in Tooting is calculated after deduction of the cases notified from Institutions in that sub-district. In Claphani the schools chiefly affected were Telferscot Road, Cavendish Road, New Park Road, and St. Andrew's Street. In the latter school cases had occurred in the latter part of the year 1908, the cases in 1909 occurring only during the first six months of the year, and four out of 11 cases occurred in January. In Telferscot Road School seven cases occurred in April,, three of these occurring in one house, and the first of these beingpossibly the cause of the other two cases. Of the five cases that occurred in Cavendish Road School, two occurred in one house. There was no sequence of cases in the other schools in Clapham that call for special notice. In Putney only 12 cases occurred among children attending; school, and in none of these was there definite evidence that infection had been received at school. In Streatham the schools chiefly affected were Hearnville Road, Eardley Road, Sunnyhill Road, and YVelham Road. In Hearnville Road 40 cases occurred, five in April, six in May, 10 in June, and 11 in July, and, as in that month the number of cases showed no signs of lessening although frequent visits had been made to the school and individual children excluded, I advised that the school should be closed so that not only could the school be thoroughly disinfected and cleansed, but unrecognised cases, which appeared to be present in spite of careful examination, would have time to become non-infective. 68 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following- report was made to the Committee on thematter:— "July, 1909. "Since the 26th May there has been a succession of cases of Scarlet Fever among children attending Hearnville Road School, more especially in the Infants' and Girls' Departments, and as from the history of the individual cases it was difficult to explain their causation except on the ground that they were due to an unrecognised case or cases, I communicated with the Education Department of the London County Council and asked that the children in these Departments should be thorougiily examined. "I visited the school on the 28th June, and, in consultation with one of the Assistant Medical Officers of the Education Department, examined the registers, and on that occasion discovered two cases obviously recovering from Scarlet Fever, in attendance. Lists of children absent were then forwarded to me, and the homes of all visited, with the result that another case was discovered. "One of the cases excluded on the 28th June, a child in Room "D," Girls' Department, was in my opinion responsible for a considerable proportion of the cases. This child had suffered since May 13th from the disease, but had not been at school until June 28th, when she was found to be still desquamating-. She had, however, been playing with other children in the street, and in this way communicated the disease to others. "I had several consultations with the London County Council Medical Officer on the matter, and we agreed to allow the School to remain open, as otherwise it would have been impossible for him to ascertain if any unrecognised cases were still in attendance, and it was anticipated that after the exclusion of the two children on the 28th June that no fresh cases would occur. This, however, did not prove to be the case as several cases have since been notified, which could not be traced to the first group, and this in spite of the most careful examination. 6g Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "I therefore advised the Medical Office of the Education Department that the school should be closed on Friday the 16th July, so that the whole school could be thoroughly disinfected and cleansed. "In all 32 cases have been notified, eight from the Infants' Department, 16 from the Girls' Department, and eight from the Boys' Department. In the Boys' Department the majority of the cases were infected out of school, and two of the boys attending had sisters suffering from the disease. "The cases were of an exceedingly mild type, in fact in the majority of cases it was almost impossible to make a correct diagnosis in the first ten days, and it was not until desquamation had occurred that a definite diagnosis could be arrived at. "In those cases that I personally examined, the desquamation was quite characteristic, but the history of previous sore throat and feverishness, although obtainable, was not so definite as to impress on the parents the necessity for obtaining medical advice. "In a considerable number of the cases excluded by the London County Council Medical Officer, there was a history of sore throat, and there is no doubt that some of those cases were of an Infectious character. It was also clear that the later desquamation in Scarlet Fever is not so infectious as was at one time supposed, otherwise there would have been a considerable number of cases infected by the attendance of the two children excluded on June 28th. "The Girls' and Infants' Departments will be thoroughly disinfected this week, and I have been informed that the whole school is to be cleansed and redecorated during the holidays." In Sunnyhill Road, eight out of a total of 17 cases occurred in April, but five of the cases in that month were in one house. F 7° Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Tooting the only school specially infected was Franciscan, Road, but here the number of cases was spread all over the year with the exception of the months of June and August. In Wandsworth, Waldron Road and Southfields Schools had; the greatest number of cases, 29 occurring in the former and 20 in the latter, but the cases were, as in Franciscan Road School,. Tooting, spread over the year. 7' Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXVII. SCHOOLS. January. February. March. April. May. June. July. August. September. October. November. December.

The Chart shows the number of cases notified in each week during the year. The greatest number, viz:—35, was notified in the third week of January, and the smallest, viz.:—eight, in the first week of September. There were other two weeks, viz.:—the third week of June and the fourth week of July, when the number of cases notified was over 30, the increase in these weeks having been chiefly due to the cases from Hearnville Road School. Of the total number of cases notified, viz.:—987, eight or '8r per cent. were under one year, compared with 13 or one per cent. in 1908; 253 or 25.6 per cent, were from one to five years, compared with 318 or 25.8 per cent.; 574 or 58.1 per cent. from five to 15 years, compared with 716 or 58.1 per cent.; 94 or 9.5 per cent. from 15 to 25 years, compared with 110 or nine per cent.; and 38 or 5.9 per cent. from 25 to 65 years, compared with 75 or 6.1 per cent. Diphtheria. The number of cases of Diphtheria notified during; the year shows a satisfactory decrease compared with 1908, and is also under the average number for the last 10 years.

The total number of cases notified was 380 (67 in Clapham, 25 in Putney, 119 in Streatham, 61 in Tooting, and 108 in Wandsworth), compared with 581 in 1908, 629 in 1907, and 566 in 1906. This number was 145 under the corrected, and 299 under the uncorrected decennial average. In all the sub-districts there has been a decrease compared with 1908. In Clapham of 24, in Putney of 14, in Streatham of 18, in Tooting of 28, and in Wandsworth of 117. The greatest number of cases occurred in Streatham, and tha smallest in Putney. The number of cases notified per 1,000 of population was no, compared with 1.73 in 1908, 1.93 in 1907, and 1.79 in 1906, and in London 1.38, compared with 1.64, 1.65 and 170. 314 or 91 per cent. of the cases were removed to hospital "where 25 died, and 66 or 9 per cent. were treated at home with four deaths. The case mortality was 7.6 per cent., compared with 6.3 in 1908, 6.3 in 1907, 8.9 in 1906, 8.9 in 1905, and 10.8 in 1904. The case mortality for the whole of London for the year 1909 was 9'1 per cent., compared with 9 2 in 1908, 8.89 in 1907, 8.7 in 1906, and 8.5 in 1905. The case mortality among cases treated in hospital was 7.9 per cent., and among those treated at home 6 per cent. The sligfht increase in the case mortality may be explained by the lact that during the year no outbreak occurred in which it was necessary to take a large number of swabs, consequently very few cases of Diphtheria were notified on bacteriological diagnosis alone. The following Table shows the number of cases, the case-rate per 1,000 living., for the year and for the 10 previous years, the number of deaths and the death-rate for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts. 76 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The maximum number of cases, viz.:—17, was notified in the last week of April, and the minimum, viz.:—one, in the third and fourth weeks of August. At no period of the year was there any outbreak to call for special notice, and this is due, as was stated in my Report for last year, largely to the methods adopted for dealing with cases in elementary schools.

In Clapham, out of a total of 67 cases, 25 or 38.4 per cent. occurred in children attending school ; in Putney, of 25 cases, 12 or 48 per cent.; in Streatham, of 119 cases, 72 or 60.5 per cent.; in Tooting, of 61 cases, 29 or 47.5 per cent.; in Wandsworth, of 108 cases, 39 or 36.1 per cent. ; and in the whole Borough, of 380 cases, 177 were in attendance at schools in the Borough, and 10 at schools outside the Borough, a total of 187, or 49.2 per cent. Of the remaining cases, viz. :—193, in 45 or 11.8 per cent., the diagnosis was incorrect, and 148 or 39 per cent. were not in attendance at school. From the above percentages it would appear that school infection played a more important part than it did in 1908 when the percentage of children in attendance at school affected was only 40, compared with 49.2 in 1909, and not in attendance 50.6 compared with 39. An examination of the Table shows, however, that in Clapham and Putney the number of cases in each school was small, and that they occurred at irregular intervals throughout the year. In Streatham, Eardley Road School had a sequence of cases in the first four months of the year, and Hearnville Road School had five cases in the month of July and four in November. In Tooting, Franciscan Road School was chiefly affected, but only 11 cases occurred during the year chiefly in the last three months, while in Wandsworth there was no sequence of cases in. any of the schools. Of the total cases notified 45 were incorrectly diagnosed, compared with 54 in 1908, leaving a total of 335, compared with 527 in 1908, and 585 in 1907. 17 cases were notified among children attending private schools, compared with 11 in 1908, and 21 in 1907. 81 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. No cases of Diphtheria were notified as having occurred in children attending the following elementary schools in the Borough :— In Clapham :— Aristotle Road. Christchurch. Haselrigge Road. New Park Road. New Road. St. Mary's Roman Catholic, Crescent Lane. In Putney:— Girls' School, Walker's Place. In Streatham:— Christchurch, Roupell Park. Hitherfield Road. Holy Trinity, Upper Tulse Hill. Nightingale Square Roman Catholic. Fircroft Road. In Tooting Fountain Road. In Wandsworth:— Eltringham Street. Frogmore. St. Michael's. St. Thomas's. W andle. Warple Way. In all, 19 schools remained free from Diphtheria, compared with 21 in 1908. Of the total number of cases of Diphtheria, eight or 2.1 per cent. occurred among children under one year, 117 or 30.8 per cent. among children from one to five years, 195 or 51.4 per cent. from five to 15 years, 28 or 7.3 per cent. from 15 to 25 years, and 32 or 8.4 per cent, from 25 to 65 years. 82 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 314 cases removed to hospital, 45 were reported not to have suffered from Diphtheria. Drainage defects were found in only 13 premises in which cases of Diphtheria occurred, compared with 56 in 1908, and 92 in 1907. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 46 cases of Scarlet Fever occurred after the return of cases from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, compared with 57 in 1908, and 41 in 1907. There were also four cases of Diphtheria, compared with 17 in 1908, and one in 1907. 10 of the return cases occurred in Clapham, none in Putney,. 16 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 11 in Wandsworth. Of the return cases of Diphtheria two occurred in Streatham and two in Wandsworth. The following Table shows the date of removal to hospital of the first case, the date of return from hospital, the number of days the first case was in hospital, the date of the first symptoms of the subsequent case, and the number of days elapsing between the return of the first case and the first symptoms of the subsequent case or cases. The average number of days the cases of Scarlet Fever were in hospital was 65.47, compared with 63.6 in 1908, and in the cases of Diphtheria 41.25 days, compared with 57.4 in 1908. 83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In only four of the cases was there any complaint made by the parent of the condition of the children returned, three of these suffering shortly after their return from nasal, and one from ear, discharge. There has been a considerable decrease in the number of these cases compared with the year 1908, due largely to the warning given to parents not to permit the children returned from hospital to associate with the other children in the house for some time. Another return case of Scarlet Fever occurred, but the first case was notified at a seaside resort and was returned from the hospital there, the first symptoms of the case in this Borough appearing five days after the other case returned. For many years no cases have been recorded of subsequent cases occurring at home after the recovery of previous cases in the same house, but this year six cases occurred, five in one house, and one in another. G 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the first of these cases the notification was received on the 25th August, and was certified by the medical attendant to have recovered on the 3rd October. The first of the subsequent cases in this house occurred on the 22nd October, and the second on the 23rd. These two cases were certified by the medical attendant to have recovered on the 14th December. On the 26th December other three cases were notified, one of these being a servant and the other two schoolboys who had returned to the house on the 20th December and were taken ill on the 26th. Enteric Fever. 66 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year (13 from Clapham, 11 from Putney, 15 from Streatham, 19 from Tooting, and eight from Wandsworth), compared with 60 in 1908, 70 in 1907, 96 in 1906, and 96 in 1905. 47 of the cases were removed to hospital where four died, and 19 were treated at home with two deaths. The total number of deaths was six (one in Clapham, none in Putney, three in Streatham, one in Tooting, and one in Wandsworth), compared with seven in 1908, 10 in 1907, 15 in 1906, 11 in 1905, and 11 in 1904. The number of deaths was one less than in 1908, and 14.4 under the decennial average. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was .19, compared with 18 in 1908, .21 in 1907, .30 in 1906, and .33 in 1905, and with .21 for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from Fever was .017 per 1,000, compared with .02 in 1908, .03 in 1907, .048 in 1906, .04 in 1905, and .04 in 1904, while the rate for the whole of London was .03, compared with .04 in 1908, .04 in 1907, .05 in 1906, .05 in 1905, and .06 in 1904. CHART Showing the number of cases of ENTERIC FEVER notified during each week of the year 1909. 87 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 47 cases removed to hospital, 15 or 32 per cent. were found not to be suffering from Enteric Fever, compared with 30 per cent. in 1908. The Chart shows the number of cases notified during the year. In 20 of the weeks during the year no cases were notified, one case each in 15 of the weeks, two cases each in eight of the weeks, three cases each in two of the weeks, four cases in one of the weeks, five cases in two of the weeks, and six cases in two of the weeks. The maximum number of cases, viz. :—six, was notified in the last week of February and the first week of September. Of the 66 cases notified 14 were not Enteric Fever, leaving 52 cases in which special enquiries were made as to the probable cause of the disease. In only five of the cases was the disease probably contracted by eating shell-fish, in five it was contracted outside the Borough (one in Spain, one in Ramsgate, one in Lincoln, and two in other places), in two the infection was contracted from other cases, in seven probably from watercress, in nine from polluted milk supply, while in 24 no history of infection could be ascertained. With regard to the five cases caused by shell-fish, two were from oysters, two from mussels, and one from winkles. The nine cases caused by infected milk supply were the subject of special reports, as follows :— "On the 18th February 1 received a letter from Dr. Crookshank, Medical Officer of Health to the Urban District of Barnes, stating that five cases of Enteric Fever had recently occurred in his district in all of which the milk had been supplied by a purveyor in this Borough. "The same evening I interviewed the purveyor and, although at that time no cases had been notified to me, I asked him to let me have a list of all the farms from which he 88 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. derived his supplies. He at the same time informed me that he had been in communication with Dr. Crookshank and that he had Pasteurised all the milk which was sent out from the two depots on the 15th February. I made full inquiries as to the health of his employees, and particularly as to the health of the foreman who was in charge of the drumming or mixing ot the milk. He informed me that there was no illness among any of his employees, and as the cases in Barnes were supplied by different roundsmen I had no reason to suspect that the milk was infected in this district. 1 advised the purveyor to communicate with all the farms at once, as well as providing me with their names and addresses. During this interview he showed me a printed form of contract in which it is definitely stated that if any cases of infectious disease occur at any of the farms the consignee is to be at once informed, and also that the consignor is to be remunerated at the same rate even if no milk is sent. "The next day, having received a list of seventeen farms in six counties from him 1 communicated with all the Medical Officers of Health of the County or district in which the farms were situated. "I again called on the purveyor on the evening of the 19th and saw telegrams which he had received from the farms, all of which gave negative replies to the letter sent by him asking if there was any illness at the farms. On Saturday morning, the 20th February, the purveyor received a letter from a farm near Highworth, Wiltshire, stating that a case of Enteric Fever had occurred there, and that the officer who called had stated that as the dairy was at a distance from the farm there was no risk of infecting the milk, but instructions were given to notify the dairyman in London. These instructions, however, were not carried out. It is difficult to understand why the farmer did not notify the purveyor, as, if he had done so, the infected milk could have been stopped on the 30th January. "On Sunday, 21st February, I again saw the purveyor, who had visited the farms in company with a bacteriologist, 89 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. and he ascertained that a ease of Enteric Fever had been treated at the farm house for some weeks, also that the water supply to the dairy was derived from a spring which appeared to be contaminated by the drainage of a cottage in the vicinity. "The Medical Officers of Health of all the districts replied stating that there was no infectious disease at any of the farms with the exception of the farm in Wiltshire, and Dr. Tubb-Thomas, the County Medical Officer of Health, communicated with me on the 22nd February stating that he had just heard of a case of Enteric Fever at that farm. He also stated that there was illness at this farm in November or December last, treated as Tubercular Meningitis, but that he was inquiring into the matter, and that he had had no cases of Enteric Fever in any of the Rural Districts in which the other farms were situated during the months of December, January, and February. Dr. Tubb-Thomas also informed me that the Medical Officer of Health of the Rural District in which the farm is situated was Dr. Streeten, and I at once wrote to him on the matter. "As it was quite possible that cases were occurring in this Borough clue to the same cause, and knowing the difficulty of diagnosis, especially in children, I at once communicated with the mcdical practitioners in the district in which milk was supplied by this particular purveyor, stating that the milk supply was infected, and that cases of Enteric Fever had occurred in another district in which this milk supply was implicated. "After this circular was sent the following seven cases were notified to me:— 90 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Case. Age. Date of first symptoms. Date of notification. S. E. 5½ years 9th February 22nd February. A. T. 48 ,, 12th „ 23rd P. H. 5 ,, 16th „ 23rd G. M. 18½ 17th „ 25th „ K. H. 4¾ ,, 12th ,, 1st March. M. W. 25 ,, 20th 2nd „ D. B. 14 „ 11th „ 4th „ "In addition to the above seven cases one case was infected in this district, but was notified in Barnes as the patient had removed before the disease was diagnosed. "The purveyor, on Saturday, 20th February, stopped the distribution of milk from that particular farm, and instructed the farmer not to forward any more milk until he was further advised. "Dr. Streeten, Medical Officer of Health for the Highworth Rural District, communicated with me on the 24th February, and the following is a copy of his letter:— " 'Highworth Rural District. " 'Town Hall, " 'Swindon, " '24th February, 1909. " 'Re Enteric at Blunsdon. " 'Dear Sir, " 'In reply to your letter re above. A case of Enteric Fever, I. S., aged 14, was notified to me on January 29th, by Dr. Lewarne, of Cricklade, Wilts, and a second case, mother of this child, on February 22nd. 91 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. " 'I visited the farm on February 1st. Instructions were given to notify the dairyman in London who received the milk from this farm. The dairy is isolated from the house, and no one from the house was to enter the dairy or handle the milk. " 'The water supply is from a spring in the coraline formation on Blunsdon Hill, one mile distant, and it has been in use for thirty years. Last summer two cottages were built on this hill, about fifty yards above spring, one only has been inhabited, and no illness has occurred since the occupation in September of last year. No case of Fnteric has been reported in Blunsdon parish for ten years. The drainage of these cottages is to a ditch near. I hardly think it can have polluted the spring. I fancy the infection of the milk has occurred at the farm. I have ascertained that the copper, provided in the dairy for heating water for cleansing the milk utensils, is also used for domestic purposes, including the family washing. " 'If I can give you any further information please let me know. 1 am, faithfully yours, "'F. Edward Streeten. " 'Dr. P. Caldwell Smith.' " "There seems to be no reason to doubt that the milk was contaminated at the farm, but it is not clear from the information which has up to the present time been received, at what date this contamination took place. As far as the first symptoms are concerned in all the cases notified in this district, and in Barnes, I agree with Dr. Crookshank that the milk was probably infective on the 16th January. I have not yet been able to ascertain the date of the first symptoms of the case notified to Dr. Streeten on the 29th January, but I am making further inquiries. 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "The cases in Barnes appear to have been notified earlier than in Wandsworth, as the first symptoms in the earliest of Dr. Crookshank's cases occurred on the 30th January, whereas as far as could be ascertained in the cases in this Borough, the first symptoms of the earliest case occurred on the 9th February. "If the infected milk was Pasteurised on the 15th February, and completely withdrawn on the 20th February, I am of opinion that no further cases will occur in which the first symptoms would appear later than the 1st or 2nd of March. Cases, however, may be notified for another fortnight owing to the difficulty in diagnosis. "I have further communicated with the medical men in the district informing them that the source of the infected milk had been traced, and that the distribution of that particular milk had been stopped, also that all the other farms supplying milk to this particular purveyor had been inspected and found in a satisfactory condition. "I have had another interview with Dr. Crookshank, of Barnes, and have seen a copy of his report which he is forwarding to the Local Government Board. In that report he agrees with my opinion that this farm was the cause of the infection. The total number of cases which have occurred in his district up to the present have been 11, one of which, however, as previously stated, having been infected in this Borough. "A further report will be made on the 18th March. "18th March. "Re Enteric Fever. "Since the date of my last report only two cases of Knteric Fever have ben notified in connection with the outbreak in this Borough. Both these cases occurred in households which had been previously infected, but both cases were infected about the same time as the case first notified. In all 93 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. nine cases have occurred, exclusive of the one which was notified in Barnes, but which was infected in this Borough. I am of opinion that no further primary cases will occur, and can report that the measures which have been taken have been successful in preventing an outbreak which might have been serious. "In accordance with the instructions of the Committee I visited the farm in Wiltshire in company with Dr. Crookshank, Medical Officer of Health for the Barnes Urban District, and Dr. Streeten, Medical Officer of Health for Highworth, in which district the farm is situated. With reference to the condition of the cowsheds I may say that these are in a most unsatisfactory condition, being dilapidated and dirty. There were also accumulations of manure in the vicinity of the cowsheds, some of which to all appearances have not been removed for months. The cows looked fairly healthy, but the udders showed evidence of not having been recently cleansed. I was informed, however, that steps are being taken to reconstruct the cowsheds and dairy arrangements. The dairy itself was satisfactory, except that the lighting of that part of the dairy where the cooling was carried on was not good. This also is being remedied. I also inspected the copper where the washing was stated to have been done, and there seems no reason to alter the statement in my last report with reference to this being in all probability the immediate cause of the pollution of the milk supply. "I made inquiries of the farmer with reference to the child who had been ill in July or August, 1908, but could not get any particulars, nor would he permit me to have a specimen of the blood or excreta for bacteriological examination. "The dairy is about 50 yards from the house where the two cases of Enteric Fever are presently being treated, and, as far as I can judge, everything is now being done to prevent pollution either of the water or of the milk. "I also inspected the water supply, and although the analysis does not show evidence of any pollution yet it is quite 94 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. possible for the water to be polluted in transit from the source to the farm. "I also made an inspection of another farm about a mile and a half distant, to which the cows from the infected farm were to be removed, and I am of opinion that if the cows are removed, and if the water supply is satisfactory, there will be no risk in permitting the milk to be sent to this Borough for distribution. "At the present time the farmer is making cheese from the milk of the cows at the farm, but whether the processes which are carried on in its manufacture will be sufficient to destroy the typhoid bacillus is a matter not yet practically decided. Theoretically these processes should be inimical to the existence of this bacillus, and I called the attention of the Medical Officer of Health of the district to this fact. "This outbreak has made me realise more fully the importance of the notification of all cases of infectious disease by the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the farm is situated to the Medical Officer of Health of the district to which milk is sent. If this had been done in this outbreak the milk supply would have been stopped on the 30th January, and it is quite possible that some of the persons would not have been infected. I am of opinion that it would be advisable to call the attention of the Local Government Board to this so that a clause could be inserted in the Milk Bill which is shortly to come before Parliament. "In conclusion, during the whole period of the outbreak in the necessary inquiries I have been assisted very much by the purveyor in this Borough." The outbreak, although a small one owing to the measures taken, might have proved excedingly serious, and 1 have to thank both Dr. Crookshank, of Barnes, and Dr. Streeten, of Swindon, for the help given in elucidating the cause. We were not quite satisfied that the first case at Highworth, notified on the 21st January, was the cause of all the cases that occurred in this Borough and in Barnes, unless the case was infective some days before it was seen by the medical attendant. 95 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. One satisfactory feature of the outbreak was that no deaths occurred among the cases in this Borough. In only two cases had members of the patient's family had an attack of Enteric Fever, one 23 and the other 10 years before. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. In 112 cases (52 of Scarlet Fever, 45 of Diphtheria, and 15 of Enteric Fever), information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals that the patients were not suffering from the disease notified or any other notifiable disease, compared with 110 in 1908, 111 in 1907, 93 in 1906, 97 in 1905, and 94 in 1904. Of the 1,171 cases removed to hospital, in 112 or 9.5 per cent. the diagnosis was incorrect, compared with 6.9 per cent. in 1908, 6.5 in 1907, 6.7 in 1906, 5.2 in 1905, and 10 in 1904. There has been a marked increase in the percentage of incorrect diagnosis compared with the previous year. TABLE XL/1. Disease. No. of cases of mistaken diagnosis. Total. Total cases removed.

The death-rate was 19 per 1,000, compared with 18 in 1908,. and 25 for the whole of London in 1909. This disease was slightly more fatal in London and in this Borough in the year 1909 than in the previous year. In the subdistricts of Clapham and Wandsworth it was slightly more prevalent than in the other sub-districts. The number of cases notified from schools was 538, compared with 612 in 1908, 255 of these being from schools in the sub-district of Wandsworth, and the schools chiefly affected in that sub-district were Southfield, Wandle, St. Faith's and' Waldron Road. There were also 111 cases notified from schools in Clapham,. the schools chiefly affected having been Haselrigge Road, Telferscot Road and Bonneville Road. In Putney the school chiefly affected was St. Mary's, and in Streatham Mitcham Lane and St. Andrew's. The greatest mortality from Measles and Whooping Cough occurs among children under five years of age. Of the 175 deathsthat occurred from these diseases, 163 or 93 per cent, were deaths of children under five years. Other Diseases Notified from Schools. In addition to the 1,670 cases of Measles and 538 of Whooping Cough notified by the teachers of elementary schools, there were also notified 899 cases of Chicken-pox, 645 of Mumps, and 590 of Ringworm. No action is at present taken by the Sanitary Authority after notification of these diseases, although during the prevalence of Small-pox cases of Chicken-pox were visited. 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Chicken-pox was most prevalent in Streatham and Wandsworth, Mumps in Clapham and Wandsworth, and Ringworm in Clapham and Wandsworth. All these cases of non-notifiable diseases were more regularly notified by the teachers during the year 1909, and I have received every assistance from the teachers of schools in dealing with those cases that were investigated.

Information is given to the parents of all unprotected children that a case of Measles has occurred in the classroom, and instruction by means of a card is also given as to the symptoms of the disease and the procedure to be adopted as regards school attendance if the child shows any of these symptoms. Epidemic Influenza. 89 deaths, 41 of males and 48 of females, were due to this disease, compared with 85 in 1908, 88 in 1907, and 70 in 1906. There has thus been an increase of seven deaths compared with the previous year, but a decrease of 2.4 compared with the 'corrected decennial average. 15 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 10 in Putney, 33 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 22 in Wandsworth. The death-rate was 26 per 1,000, compared with 25 in 1908, .27 in 1907, and .22 in 1906. 37 of the deaths were of persons from 25 to 65 years, and 43 •of persons over 65 years. Diarrhoea. 52 deaths, 28 of males and 24 of females, occurred from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis during the year, compared with 101 in 1908, 65 in 1907, 218 in 1906, 137 in 1905, and 208 in 1904. There has thus been a decrease of 49 in the number of deaths from these diseases compared with the previous year, and of 129.9, compared with the corrected decennial average. 10 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, seven in Streatham, 14 in Tooting, and 19 in Wandsworth. In all the sub-districts the number of deaths was less than in 11908, the greatest decrease having been in Streatham and Wandsworth. 108 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Clapham the number decreased from 16 to 10, in Putney from nine to two, in Streatham from 28 to seven, in Wandsworth from 30 to 19, and in Tooting from 18 to 14. The death-rate was .15 per 1,000., compared with .30 in 1908,. .20 in 1907, and .70 in 1906. The death-rate for the whole of London also shows a decrease, it being .32, compared with .53 in 1908, but in the three previous years the rates were : .33 in 1907 .95 in 1906, and .72 in 1905. The death-rate in the sub-districts was as follows:—In Clapham .14, compared with .23 in 1908; in Putney .06, compared with .29; in Streatham .06, compared with .27; in Tooting .43, compared with .57; and in Wandsworth .19, compared with .31. Of the total number of deaths registered, 42 or 80 per cent, were of infants under one year, compared with 73 per ccnt. in 1908, 83 per cent, in 1907, 86 per cent, in 1906, and 87 per cent. in 1905 Including Enteritis, the total number of deaths was 124, compared with 183 in 1908, 127 in 1907, 289 in 1906, 203 in 1905, and 301 in 1904. Of these 124 deaths, 90 or 72.5 per cent, were of infants under one year. The following Table shows the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis under one year for the four quarters of 1909,. and for the five previous years. 109 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The proportion of deaths in this quarter to total deaths from Diarrhoea is smaller than in previous years with the exception of 1907. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, Zymotic Enteritis, and Enteritis under one year represents 15 per cent, of the total mortality at that age, compared with 19 per cent, in 1908, 13.8 per cent, in 1907, 33 per cent, in 1906, 21.1 per cent, in 1905, and 28.8 per cent, in 1904, so that the diminution of the mortality under one year was, as in the two previous years, largely due to the decrease in the number of deaths of infants from the above causes. In 82 out of the total deaths under one year, special enquiries were made, and the following Table shows the nature of the food! given. 110 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XL VIII.

In 43, or 57 per cent., cows' milk, either alone or with condensed milk or farinaceous food, was given; while in 17, or 22'6 per cent., condensed milk only, or condensed milk and farinaceous food, was given. In seven cases no information could be obtained, •three in Streatham, two in Tooting, and two in Wandsworth. In many of the cases the enquiries of the Inspectors showed that the children had been suffering from other diseases, or had been delicate from birth. The following exceptional cases may be cited as examples:— 111 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (1.) One child, aged four months, born prematurely, the youngest of three under three years, came of a consumptive family, and had been ill for 2½ months- (2.) Another, aged four months, had been ailing from birth. The mother had epileptic fits, and had lost two children during the year, the whole family being delicate. (3.) Another, illegitimate and born prematurely, died at three months, had been delicate from birth. When first visited the child was in a wretched condition, face covered with sores and very puny and emaciated. The mother removed shortly afterwards and could not be traced till the death of the child was registered. (4.) Another, aged eight months, had Diarrhoea from birth, and had been in two hospitals and attended by three doctors. (5.) Another, eight weeks, was the youngest of 18, nine only being alive. This child was entirelv breast fed. (6.) Another was 12 months all but five days, had been ailing from birth, had had Measles, Bronchitis and Chickenpox, and had been in a hospital. (7 and 8.) Two others, of four and five months, were nurse children, and had been deserted, one of these was illegitimate. The next Table shows the result of the enquiries made after these deaths, arranged in Wards, and there is also shown the number of infants who had been previously visited, the number of illegitimate infants, and the social status of the parents. It may also be seen in the Table that only eight of the infants who died from Diarrhœa had been fed in accordance with the 112 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. pamphlet left by the Inspectors, and also that of the total number of deaths, viz.:—82, 10 were prematurely born, and 23 were delicate from birth. Of the eight stated to have been fed in accordance with the instructions on the pamphlet, three were delicate from birth, one was illegitimate, and one suffered from Acute Bronchitis. During- the year the female Sanitary Inspectors have continued the work begun in 1905, in visiting the homes where births had occurred, and they have also had during the year, as is stated in their report, valuable assistance from several voluntary health visitors. 113 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

"We have the honour of submitting to you a report of our visits among infants during the year 1909. "We had the help of three voluntary workers at different times during the year—one from the 15th February to the 21 st April, one from the 17th August to the 22nd October, and the third from the 24th August to the 21st December. Out of the total number of visits, viz.:—4,102 (which includes re-visits and ineffectual calls), 1,943 were paid by the voluntary workers (Clapham 113, Putney 116, Balham 126, Tooting 423, Southfield 288, Fairfield 286, and Springfield 591). The large proportion of voluntary work done in Wandsworth is due to the fact that so many more cases of Phthisis were notified under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, in that district than in the others, and this work occupied a great part of our time. "The total number of visits paid after registration of births will be found in the first of our Tables (No. L.), which also shows the method of feeding at the first visit, and the number of ineffectual calls. The number of deaths among infants visited we have this year shown in a separate Table, so as to indicate the age in months at which they died. "In Putney only one death occurred, the cause being Syncope and Convulsions. In Balham three died from Bronchitis and one from Marasmus. In Tooting 10 died from Diarrhoea and Enteritis, one at the age of one month, one at two months, three at three months, one at four months,, two at seven months, one at eight months, and one at nine months; two died from Marasmus aged one and four months; and three from other causes, at two, three and five months. In Southfield three died : two from Diarrhoea at the age of seven months, and one from Bronchitis aged one month. In Fairfield eight died : two from Diarrhoea aged two and three months, two from Marasmus also aged two and three months, and four from other causes aged two, three and eight months. In Springfield there were 23 deaths, chiefly from Bronchitis and Pneumonia, 10 being due to that cause, four died at the age of two months, one at three months, two at 115 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. four months, one at six months, one at 10 months, and one at 11 months respectively; three were due to Marasmus at two, three and four months; and six from other causes (two beingtwins) at ages ranging from three weeks to six months. "In addition to those infants who died from chest and lung diseases we found many ill with Bronchitis, Whooping Cough and severe colds; we were, in fact, struck by the prevalence of these complaints amongst infants, particularly during the latter part of the year. 44 were found to be suffering from Bronchitis and Pneumonia, 11 from Whooping Cough, and 25 from very severe colds. "Of the 2,268 infants visited only 56 were premature (Putney three, Balham three, Tooting eight, and Wandsworth 42); of these, eight died (Tooting two and Wandsworth six). 28 were delicate from birth (Clapham two, Balham nine, Tooting 12, and Wandsworth five), and of these, six died, four in Tooting and two in Wandsworth, the latter being twins. "Again we found difficulty in keeping in touch with the illegitimate births. Two wrong addresses were given, one in Tooting and one in Southfield, two removed immediately after confinement, one in Tooting and one in Springfield ; and four died previous to our visit. Of the 43 visited (Clapham four, Putney two, Balham three, Tooting 18, Wandsworth 16), 12 came into the Borough for confinement only (Balham two, Tooting seven, Clapham one, Wandsworth two), the majority leaving the children to be nursed here. At the first visit 15 were wholly breast fed (Clapham one, Putney two, Tooting three, Wandsworth nine), and at the second visit seven (Balham two and Wandsworth five), one in Wandsworth having discontinued cows' milk and biscuit. Ten had removed when the second call was made and could not be traced. Two only of those visited died, one in Tooting from Atrophy and Pertussis, aged two months, and one in Wandsworth from Diarrhoea, aged three months, the latter being an exceptional case referred to in the Diarrhoea report. Of the 43 illegitimate infants, two born in Wandsworth were premature, and four in Tooting were delicate from birth. 116 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "The second Table (No. LI.) shows the number of revisits, and the method of feeding then found, the average age at the second visit being from four to five months. "The proportion of infants entirely breast fed this year is practically the same as last, as is also the proportion of those having milk or food :n addition to the breast. The number of those having cows' milk is greater, and of those having condensed milk less, and there is an appreciable decrease in the use of farinaceous and other foods. One mother's reason for not giving the breast was that "she did not like the idea of it." The above applies to the method of feeding at the first visit. "With regard to the feeding" at the second visit there is a slight decrease in the proportion of those wholly breast fed, 65 as against 66 per cent., but on the other hand, there is a great increase in the proportion of those having cows' milk only. Several mothers who were giving a little milk or a little food (chiefly biscuit), in addition to the breast at our first visit, were by our advice giving the breast alone at the second visit. "The use of boat bottles is still on the increase, 399 boat bottles were used (Clapham 16, Putney 13, Balham 46, Tooting 127, Southfield 23, Fairfield 66, Springfield 108), as against 99 tube bottles (Clapham two, Putney two, Balham 20, Tooting 47, Southfield one, Fairfield six, Springfield 21) In 16 cases (Balham six, Tooting six, Fairfield three, Springfield one), where tube bottles were being used at our first visit, we found boat bottles substituted at the second visit. Both tube and boat bottles were in use in 12 instances (Clapham one, Balham six, Tooting four, Springfield one), and spoons were used in preference to either in 67 cases (Clapham six, Balham 10, Tooting 28, Fairfield 10, Springfield 13). "With regard to employment of mid wives, out of the 2,268 mothers visited, 964 availed themselves of their services. Of these, 660 employed midwives registered under the London County Council (Clapham 43, Putney 33, Balham 36, 117 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Tooting 195, Southfield 47, Fairfield 82, Spring-field 222). The non-reg-istered midwives were employed chiefly by the very poor (Clapham five, Putney 22, Balham 20, Tooting- 83,. Southfield 36, Fairfield 57, Springfield 81). "The sanitary defects discovered in the course of our visits were remedied, or if involving structural work, referred to you. 160 intimation notices were served (Clapham one, Putney two, Balham 22, Tooting 64, Southfield seven, Fairfield 33, Springfield 31), and five statutory notices were required (Balham one, Tooting two, Southfield one, and Springfield one)." 118 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Of the 2,268 infants visited, it was found that 1,824, or 80.4 per cent., were wholly breast-fed, while 444, or 19.2 per cent., were otherwise fed. If, however, we add to the number wholly breast-fed the number of children in which other foods were given in addition we find that the percentage is increased to 89.2, a slight increase compared with the previous years. 146, or 6 per cent., were fed on cows' milk only, but nine had other foods in addition, raising the percentage to 6.4, a decrease compared with 1908, when the percentage was 6 7. 76 had condensed milk only, and six had condensed milk and food, a total of 82, or 3.6 per cent., an increase of 1 per cent, compared with 1908. Eight infants were fed on farinaceous and other foods, compared with 11 in the previous year. With reference to the cases re-visited, it was found that out of a total of 948, 617 or 65 per cent, were still breast-fed only, compared with 66.7 per cent, in 1908; while taking other foods with the breast the percentage was 77'8. The total number of deaths among those visited by the Inspectors was 57 (one in Putney, four in Streatham, 18 in Tooting, and 34 in Wandsworth). Table LII. shows these deaths arranged in monthly age periods. The mortality among the infants visited by the Inspectors was only 25, compared with 86 per 1,000, the rate for the Borough for the year. 121 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LI I.

The total number of deaths from Cancer and other malignant diseases was 275, 101 of males and 174 of females, compared with 274 in 1908, 272 in 1907, 256 in 1906, an increase of one, but s decrease of 12.5 compared with the corrected decennial average. The corrected death-rate was .81 per 1,ooo, compared with .83 in 1908, .86 in 1907, .82 in 1906, .78 in 1905, .92 in 1904, and .98 in 1903. The number of deaths and the death-rate in each sub-district was as follows:—Clapham 57 and '82; Putney 19 and .6o; Streatham 97 and .90; Tooting 22 and .68; and Wandsworth 80 and .82. One of the deaths occurred at ages from one to five years, one from five to 15 years, four from 15 to 25 years, 161 from 25 to 65 years, and 108 over 65 years.

It is satisfactory to note that there has again been a slight decrease in the rate from this disease compared with the previous year and with the decennial average. In the decennium 1851-1860 this rate for England and Wales was only 32.5 but it increased in 1891-1900 to 75'8, and for London only in the decennium 1891-1900 to 86.3. Tubercular Diseases. The total number of deaths from diseases of a Tuberculous nature was 362, compared with 382 in 1908, 352 in 1907, 376 in 1906, 360 in 1905, and 380 in 1904. 273 of the deaths were due to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 51 to Tubercular disease of the Brain, and 38 to other forms of Tubercular diseases. 126 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of deaths from Tubercular disease of the Lungs; and other Tubercular diseases and the rates per 1,000 for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts are shown in the next Table. The corrected death-rate from Tubercular disease of the Lung's was .80 per 1,000, compared with .83 in 1908, .81 in 1907, .86 in 1906, .93 in 1905, and 1.07 in 1904; from other Tubercular diseases .26, compared with .33, .28, .35, .33 and .36; and from all Tubercular diseases ro6, compared with 1.16, 1.09, 1.21, 1.26, and 1.43.

With regard to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, the ratesfor Clapham, Putney and Tooting were above, and those for Streatham and Wandsworth under last year's rates. From other Tubercular diseases the rate was .07 lower than, in 1908. 127 Report oj the Medical Officer of Health. This rate was lowest in Clapham and highest in Wandsworth,. and the rate for Tubercular disease of the Lungs was lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting. The following Table shows the death-rate per 100,000 from Tubercular disease of the Lungs for the whole Borough, and for the separate sub-districts for the year, as well as for the preceding 10 years.

The great increase in the rate in Putney was due to the fact that a number of the deaths was of persons who had removed to. that sub-district from other parts of London in consequence of premonitory symptoms of the disease. Three deaths from Tubercular disease of the Lungs occurred' in infants under one year, five in persons from one to five years, 12 from five to 15 years, 36 from 15 to 25 years, 199 from 25 to 65 years, and 18 over 65 years. From other Tubercular diseases 14 deaths occurred under one year, 36 from one to five years, 16 from five to 15 years, 11 from 15 to 25 years, 11 from 25 to 65 years, and one over 65 years. 128 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

As in previous years clerks and labourers head the list, 23 deaths having occurred among the former, one of which was a female, and 22 among the latter class. Among females, of 111 deaths, 14 only were engaged in some occupation, four having been domestic servants. 17 had been widows, wives or daughters of artisans, 26 of the labouring class, 17 of travellers or clerks, eight were children, and 27 had no occupation. 131 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The next Table shows the deaths and death-rates in males and females from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, and for other Tubercular diseases, as well as the deaths and death-rates among children under five years from other Tubercular diseases, for the 10 years 1899-1908, and for the year 1909. Among males the rate for Tubercular disease of the Lungs for the year 1909 was 1.03, compared with 1.16 the decennial average; and among females .59, compared with .76; while from other Tubercular diseases the rate among males was .26, compared with .44; and among females .25, compared with .31. Among children under five years the rate for the year was 14, compared with .24, the decennial average. Although the reduction in the rate has been considerable compared with the decennial average, yet it is not at all certain that this diminution will continue unless other additional measures are taken to prevent the spread of the disease. It is to be specially noted that during the last four years the rates have remained practically the same, and if the population has been over-estimated, which is quite probable, then these slight differences would altogether disappear. The public are not yet sufficiently educated on this question to realise that Tubercular disease of the Lungs can be prevented, but this prevention will never be brought about unless compulsory notification and segregation of the more fully advanced cases are adopted. 132 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Notification of Consumption. The Local Government Board issued an Order in December, 1908, to provide for the notification to the Medical Officers of Health of Sanitary Authorities of cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis occurring amongst the inmates of Poor Law Institutions, or amongst persons under the care of District Medical Officers, and for the taking of certain measures in such cases. This Order came into force on January 1st, 1909, and the following report was made to the Public Health Committee on the 26th April, 1909. The report was not made earlier, as it was thought advisable to wait for three months to ascertain the number of cases that would be notified in that period. "REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH ON THE NOTIFICATION OF PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS OR CONSUMPTION. "In January, 1903, a Report was made to the Council dealing with the above, and since that date the voluntary system of notification has been in force in this Borough. "In that Report I dealt fully with the question, pointing out the benefits that would possibly result from such notification, more especially in the more closely populated localities and among the necessitous poor. "It was also pointed out that the provision of Sanatoria would be beneficial, but that permanent good could not be expected unless the patient is prohibited from returning to town life and work. "In my Report for 1908, a Table is inserted showing the number of cases notified since 1903, the number of cases in which death occurred, the number removed and recovered, and the number living at the close of the year 1908. K 134 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "This Table is as follows :— Year. Cases reported. Cases died. Removed. Recovered. Not Phthisis. No enquiries. Cases living at end of 1908 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1903 86 44 9 1 ... ... ... 17 8 6 1 ... 1904 102 ... 50 8 1 1 ... 30 5 ... 6 1 1905 82 ... ... 33 4 2 ... 29 4 ... 9 1 1906 64 ... ... ... 30 5 ... 13 6 ... 9 1 1907 40 ... ... ... ... 17 ... 21 ... ... 1 1 1908 58 ... ... ... ... ... 25 12 ... ... 5 16 Totals 432 44 59 42 35 25 25 122 23 6 31 20 " In all 432 cases have been notified, and of these 230 have died, 122 have removed, 23 recovered, six were not cases of Consumption, in 31 110 enquiries were made at the request of the notifying practitioner, while 20 were still alive at the close of the year. "These cases were, with the exception of the 31 in which no enquiries were made, visited by the female Sanitary Inspectors and kept under observation till the death or removal of the patient, when the premises were disinfected and cleansed. The 20 cases remaining are still being visited by these Inspectors. The circular which was issued in 1903 is still used and valuable instruction is given by the Inspectors to those in charge of the patients, or to the patients themselves. "In the beginning of 1909 the Local Government Board issued regulations making it compulsory on every Poor Law Medical Officer to notify any cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis to the Medical Officer of Health, and also to notify any change of address of the patients. 135 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "These regulations also point out that this Council may: (i) take all such measures as are authorised with regard to the destruction and disinfection of infected articles or the cleansing or disinfection of premises; (2) take all such measures as are appropriate or necessary for the safe disposal or destruction of infective material or otherwise for the prevention of the spread of infection from such material; (3) afford or supply all such assistance, facilities or articles as will obviate, remove, or diminish the risk of infection arising from the condition of the sleeping apartment, and (4) furnish -on loan or otherwise any appliance which would assist in preventing the spread of infection. "These regulations were supplemented by a Memorandum from the Medical Officer to the Local Government Board which dealt with the pathology of the disease and also with the administrative measures that can be taken and the assistance that can be given to the patient. "It does not come within the scope of this Report to discuss the pathology of the disease as that has been dealt with fully in the Memorandum, but it will be necessary to point out to this Council what has been done during the past five years' administration to prevent the disease, and also what additional measures might be adopted to still further limit its spread. "The Memorandum states that the measures which may be adopted are educational measures, which comprise means for instructing the general community, those more directly exposed to the infection of tuberculosis, and those suffering from the disease. For instructing the general community there is no doubt that the teaching of hygiene in the elementary schools would prove most beneficial, but to the rest of the general public the difficulty of imparting the necessary information is at present a serious one. Much may be done by voluntary work by church societies, friendly societies, and by public lectures generally, but these agencies would not, in my opinion, be sufficient or even capable of reaching the careless and ignorant poor, among whom cases of this •disease are very common. 136 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "With regard to the giving of instructions to those already tuberculous, and to those in attendance on them, this has. been done in this Borough for the past six years, and with considerable success, although this cannot be definitely stated in statistical form. " More frequent visits are, however, advisable than is at present possible with the existing staff. " The other measures against Tuberculosis mentioned inthe Memorandum are the investigation of cases of the disease, advice being given, disinfection and cleansing recommended, and spit bottles supplied to the poor. Spit bottles have not vet been supplied by this Council, but from the reports of the cases notified since January 1st, this would appear to be a most desirable and necessary measure to adopt, and not a costly one. Each bottle costs about 5d. wholesale, and four dozen would possibly be supplied in one year. " The provision of Dispensary and Poor Law treatment of patients is a measure which is at present carried out in this Borough to a considerable extent, as will be observed in the particulars given further on in this report on the cases notified since January 1st of this year. The provision of Dispensary treatment would include all the General Hospitals,, the Brompton Hospital, as well as such agencies as the Clapham Dispensary, the Weir Dispensary, Medical Aid Societies, and Slate Clubs, most of these not being wholly self-supporting. They, however, only deal with the early treatment of cases, when the patient is in many instances still at work and able to continue his weekly contributions. As soon as these cease, he must eventually apply to the Relieving Officer, and be treated as a parish case. " The next measure—the provision of sanatoria- opens up a very wide question, and one which cannot be adequately or economically dealt with by individual boroughs. The only Metropolitan Borough which has done anything in providing sanatoria for Consumptives is Woolwich, and that Borough supports seven beds in the Peppard Sanatorium. The cost Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 137 of this amounts to about £,500 per annum, and from an educational and curative point of view, this provision by the Woolwich Council has proved decidedly satisfactory. " To sum up : the measures carried out at present in this Borough are " (1.) Notification. " (2.) Visiting cases and exercising a certain amount of supervision over those treated at home. " (3.) Disinfection and cleansing of premises after death or removal. " The other measures which might be taken are (1.) The provision of spit bottles and paper handkerchiefs. " (2.) The establishment of a dispensary for Tuberculosis. "(3.) The provision of a certain number of beds at a sanatorium for cases at an early stage of the disease. " (4.) The institutional treatment of advanced cases so as to prevent infection of the healthy. " Financial Aspect of the Subject. " Dr. Newsholme, in his book on the prevention of Tuberculosis, has collated statistics on this subject, and calculated that by the experience of England and Wales in the years 1891-1900, nearly 10 millions sterling would be saved by the total abolition of Consumption in men, making no allowance for the loss sustained by sickness, nor from the premature death of women from this disease. " It is also slated that one-eleventh of the total cost incurred by the relief of pauperism in England and Wales is caused by Consumption, the amount annually spent on paupers who were made such by Consumption being over one million pounds. 138 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. " Again, if we assume that only one year's disablementis caused by every fatal case, then the loss in wages alone,, reckoning £1 per week as an average, amounts to over one million pounds. "In this Borough 1,300 deaths of males between the ages 20-65 have occurred in the 10 years 1899-1908, or an average of 130 per annum, and a consequent loss in wages alone of £6,500 per annum. Dr. Newsholme, in dealing with this question, says: Looking at the subject from the standpoint of natural economics, it is not open to dispute that the most elaborate and complete measures of every description against Tuberculosis would only cost a fraction of the present total loss inflicted by this disease, and that this expenditure would, as time goes on, lie paid for many times over in the prevention, of sickness and increase of efficiency of the community.' " Notification of Cases since January ist, 1909. " The total number of cases notified since January ist was 173, of which 146 were cases notified under the Regulations for Poor Law cases, which came into force on that date. " Of these 173, 42 were notified from the Infirmary, 55 from the Tooting Home, 44 by District Medical Officers, and' five from other Poor Law Institutions. " Only 16 of these 173 cases are at present being treated at home, the others being treated in institutions. "15 cases have been notified from Brompton Hospital,. 14 of which are being treated at home; and 12 by private practitioners, seven of which are being treated at home. Since the beginning of the year 17 of the cases notified by the Poor Law authorities have died, and six of those notified otherwise—a total of 23 in all. 139 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "Including those notified privately in previous years,, the Inspectors have on their register for visiting 59 cases. "They report that in only one case visited is a proper spit bottle being used, and that in all the other cases rag or paper is used. "The latter is not nearly so satisfactory a means of disposal of expectoration, as a fire for destruction is not always available. I am of opinion that if the Council saw fit to supplv spit bottles much good would result." From 1st January to 31st December, 317 cases were notified, 49 of these belonging to Clapham, 18 to Putney, 47 to Streatham,. 22 to Tooting, and 122 to Wandsworth, and in 59 cases the home address was not stated. The following Table shows the number of these cases received, and also the number of times the cases were notified :— TABLE LXI. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth. Unknown.

Five cases were notified four times. Three by District Medical Officers, the Medical Superintendent of the Infirmary, and the Medical Officer to the Tooting Home twice; and two by District Medical Officers, the Medical Superintendent of the Infirmary twice, and the Medical Officer to the Tooting Home. Two cases were notified six times. One by District Medical Officers twice and the Medical Superintendent of the Infirmary four times; and one by District Medical Officers three,times and the Medical Superintendent of the Infirmary three times. This makes a total of 477 notifications received for the 317 cases. The next Table shows the number of cases in the various sub-districts, and the number who died, recovered, removed, the number still in Institutions, and the number under observation. The totals in Clapham, Tooting, and Wandsworth do not correspond with those on Table LXI., as the unknown cases have been allocated to the sub-district in which the patient last resided, this residence being in all cases an Institution in that sub-district.

Of the 71 certificates, 55 were received from Superintending Officers in the Wandsworth Union, and 13 in other Unions, two from Willesden, two from Southwark, and one each from Swansea, Strood, Croydon Rural, Central London District, Camberwell, Fulham, Chelsea, Kensington, and Paddington. Of the 55 certificates from Superintending Officers in the Wandsworth Union, 35 were received from the Union Infirmary and 20 from the Tooting Home. The 71 certificates received related to 64 cases, one case having been notified three times and five cases twice. 13 cases were notified as having gone to addresses in Clapham, four in Putney, 12 in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 27 in Wandsworth. Six of these cases could not be found, as 142 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. wrong addresses had been given. Three in Wandsworth weredischarged to Common Lodging-Houses, one discharged from Swansea to Wandsworth was taken ill on the way, and is now in Pontypridd Infirmary, one discharged from Willesden comes toWandsworth at intervals for a few days, and then returns to Willesden Infirmary. Many of the cases notified from Tooting Home at the beginning of the year could not be traced, as at the addresses given they were not known, some of them having been in that Institution for some time. 32 of the cases allocated to Tooting were notified from Leavesden Asylum as having been received from Tooting Bec Asylum, no home address being given. During the year 74 cases of Phthisis were voluntarily notified by medical practitioners, 18 belonging to Clapham, eight to Putney, four to Streatham, seven to Tooting, and 37 to Wandsworth, compared with 85 in 1908, 49 in 1907, 74 in 1906, and 104 in 1905. Of the 74 cases notified, 39 were notified from the Brompton Hospital, four from Military Hospitals, four from Margaret Street Hospital, and 27 were notified by private practitioners. At the close of the year 1909 there were 70 cases still on the register, but five of these became Poor Law cases in 1909, and are included in the number given as such cases. 22 of the cases died, six of these having been notified in 1908 and one in 1906.

Two of the cases were of infants under one year, 11 from, one to five years, 25 from five to 15 years, 55 from 15 to 25 years, 279 from 25 to 65 years, and 19 over 65 years. The whole of the work in connection with these cases was carried out by the female Sanitary Inspectors, and 1 can report that this work was done in a most thorough and satisfactory manner. The total number of visits paid was 594, 103 in Clapham, 47 in Putney, 79 in Streatham, 44 in Tooting, and 321 in Wandsworth. As in previous years, the pamphlet which has been in use since 1903 was left, and the instructions thereon were in manycases much appreciated. 144 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the year 28 spit bottles have been supplied to persons suffering from this disease, these persons not being in a position to purchase the same. It is too soon to express a definite opinion as to the beneficial effects of the compulsory notification of Poor Law cases, but there is no doubt that the educational effect is great. In the cases under observation the instructions are generally found to be carried out by the patient and his friends, specially with regard to the destruction of the sputa. The Inspectors report that there is always a difficulty in obtaining reliable family histories, and also in tracing sources of infection. In most of the cases the relatives had only a very vague idea of the causes of the disease, and connect Consumption only with lung trouble. Great difficulty is experienced in obtaining efficient isolation at home, which in many of the cases consisted only of one or two rooms. In such cases the removal of the patient to a sanatorium is advised, and in a few cases assistance has been given to try and obtain this, but not until some public institution is available for the needs of the Borough will it be possible to get those cases removed in which, from a public health aspect, isolation is necessary. Of the 391 cases visited by the Inspectors, it was possible to ascertain a definite history of infectiop in 113. In 17 of the cases the father had died of Consumption, in 16 the mother, in 11 a sister, in 10 a husband, in six both father. and sister, in four the brother, in four the brother and sister, in three the mother and brother, in one both father and mother, in four children of the patient, and in 20 other relatives. In some of the cases investigated the mortality from this disease among members of the family was most serious. For example, in one case the grandfather, two uncles, and seven brothers and sisters had previously died of Consumption; in another eight brothers and sisters, four cousins, and a maternal aunt; and in a third, father, mother sister, and brother. 145 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In 14 other cases more than two near relatives had died previous to the notification of the cases investigated. During the year disinfection was carried out at 255 premises, either after the death or removal of the patient, compared with 184 in 1908 and 135 in 1907. 69 of the premises disinfected were in Clapham, 23 in Putney, 40 in Streatham, 27 in Tooting, and 96 in Wandsworth. Deaths from Phthisis in Public Institutions. The following Table shows the number of deaths and the rate to total deaths from this disease for the year 1909, and for the previous 10 years:— TABLE LXIV. Year. Total Number of Deaths. Institutions. Union Infirmary. General and Special Hospitals. Total. Number. Rate. Number. Rate. Number.

This Table shows that the rates for the present year are higher than the average for the past 10 years, and also than the rates in 1908. The rate in the Union Infirmary showed a considerable increase, and the rate in the General and Special Hospitals has also increased, but not so greatly. Previous to 1908 these rates showed a tendency to increase, the rate in 1907 having been 39.1 and in 1898 only 23.7, but in 1908 this rate dropped to 28.9, in 1909, however, rising again to 27.1 in the Union Infirmary, and 11.7 in General and Special Hospitals. Bacteriological Examination of Sputum. 105 examinations of sputum were made at the Lister Institute : 11 from Clapham, one from Putney, 41 from Streatham, seven from Tooting, and 45 from Wandsworth. In 35 of the cases it was reported that the bacillus had been "found, and in 70 that it was absent. Circulatory Diseases. From the above group of diseases 366 deaths occurred, 168 of which, 74 males and 94 females, were due to Organic disease of the Heart. 80 of these deaths occurred in Clapham, 34 in Putney, 114 in Streatham, 42 in Tooting, and 96 in Wandsworth. Of the deaths from Organic diseases of the Heart, 11 were from five to 15 years, 15 from 15 to 25 years, 73 from 25 to 65 years, and 69 over 65 years. 147 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of deaths in 1909 was 16 more than in 1908, but -70 under the corrected decennial average. Respiratory Diseases. The total number of deaths was 690, compared with 543 in 1908, 550 in 1907, 511 in 1906, and 512 in 1905. The number of deaths was 147 more than in the previous year, and 45 above the corrected decennial average. 151 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 67 in Putney, 164 in Streatham, 99 in Tooting, and 209 in Wandsworth. Compared with 1908, there is an increase in all the subdistricts, but the greatest increase occurred in Streatham. 160 of the deaths occurred from Acute Bronchitis, compared with 139 in 1909; 186 from Chronic Bronchitis, compared with 127; 128 from Lobar Pneumonia, compared with 97; 179 from Lobular or Broncho-Pneumonia, compared with 149; and 37 from other diseases of the Respiratory Organs, compared with 31. 115 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 89 of persons from one to five years, 12 from five to 15 years, 14 from 15 to 25 years, 180 from 25 to 65 years, and 243 over 65 years. The greatest number of deaths from these diseases occurred among persons from 25 to 65 years and over 65 years. The great increase in the mortality from these diseases was due to the severe climatic conditions experienced in the months of February and March. From Chronic Bronchitis alone 126 deaths occurred among persons over 65 years of age, compared with 97 in 1908. 148 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Premature Birth and Developmental Diseases. 254 deaths, 146 of males and 108 of females, were registered as having occurred from these diseases, compared with 294 in 1908, 285 in 1907, 315 in 1906, and 317 in 1905.

In the Public Institutions in the Borough 837 deaths occurred during the year, compared with 818 in 1908, 807 in 1907, 771 in 1906, 729 in 1905, and 669 in 1904. Of these, 656 deaths were of persons not belonging to the Borough, compared with 633 in 1908, and 181 of persons belonging to the Borough, compared with 185 in 1908. The increase was due to the increase in the number of deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough. In Clapham 33 deaths occurred in the Hostel of God, threeof these being Borough residents. Of these, 21 were due to Cancer, 10 to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, one from other Septic diseases, one from other Tubercular disease, one from Nephritis, and two from other causes. Nine deaths occurred in the Priory, Roehampton, two of these being Borough residents. Of these, two were from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, one from Old Age, one from Suicide, and five from other causes.

Of the 302 deaths in the Tooting Bee Asylum, 129 were from Old Age, 14 from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 54 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, 33 from diseases of the Heart, 34 from diseases of the Nervous System, 10 from Bright's disease, six from Cancer, one from Accident, and 21 from all other causes. In the Fever Hospitals 84 deaths occurred, 37 of which belonged to the Borough, compared with 126 in 1908, 53 in 1907, 55 in 1906, 50 in 1905, and 106 in 1904. 30 of these deaths were from Scarlet Fever, 47 from Diphtheria, none from Enteric Fever, two from Measles, two from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, two from Enteritis, and one from Accident. 114 deaths occurred in the Tooting Home, 51 of which were Borough residents. 39 of these were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 44 from Old Age, 10 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, three from Cancer, four from Organic disease of the Heart, and 14 from all other causes. In W andsworth 76 deaths occurred in the Middlesex County Asylum, 14 in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, six in the Prison, and 68 in the Workhouse. Of the 76 deaths in the Middlesex County Asylum, 14 were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 10 from Old Age, eight from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, three from Bright's disease, one from Enteritis, one from other forms of Tubercular diseases, two from Cancer, 26 from diseases of the Brain and Nervous System (of which 14 were from General Paralysis of the Insane, six from Epilepsy, and one from Apoplexy), seven from Heart disease, and six from other causes. Of the 13 deaths in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, three were from Tubercular diseases, one from Cancer, two from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, and seven from all other auses. Of the six deaths in the Prison, two were from Tubercular diseases, two from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, one from disease of the Stomach, and one was a case of Execution. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 157 Of the 68 deaths in the Workhouse, 22 were from Old Age, 16 from Measles, four from Cancer, seven from Premature Birth and Developmental diseases, three from diseases of Parturition, three from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, and 13 from other causes. In other places not Institutions 88 deaths occurred, 12 of these being from Accidents, 10 from Cancer, 10 from Suicide, seven from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, two from disease of the Heart, six from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, three from Old Age, two from Nephritis, two from Influenza, one from Enteric Fever, and 23 from all other causes. 32 of these deaths occurred in Private Nursing Homes, and three in the River Thames. There has again been a marked increase in the number of deaths in Institutions, and to show that the increase has been going on for some years, the following Table has been prepared. The comparative percentages for London are also shown, and it will be noted that in the 20 years 1888-1907 these increased in London from 23.6 to 39.8, with an average of 30.2, and in Wandsworth from 15.2 to 28.'7, with an average of 18.7. In this Borough the percentage is lower than for the whole of London, and this is what might be expected in consequence of the social condition of the population, but in spite of the better social condition, it is rather startling to find that over 28 per cent, of the total deaths occurred in Institutions, and that for the year 1908 12.8 per cent, occurred in the Workhouse and Workhouse Infirmary. Compared with the 20 years' average, the greatest increase has occurred among the deaths in General and Special Hospitals, while the rate in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals is about the same. 158 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

During the year 95 notices with respect to 120 premises were received from the Water Board stating that the supply had been withdrawn. 20 of the premises were in Clapham, eight in Putney, 41 in Streatham, 26 in Tooting, and 25 in Wandsworth. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rates from 38 premises, from 38 premises in consequence of defects, in 20 the premises were empty, in 23 the supply was withdrawn by request, and in one the reason was not stated. Compared with 1908, there has been an increase in the number of notices received, chiefly in consequence of defects and at the request of the owners. Mortuaries. No change has taken place in the four Mortuaries during the year. I have inspected them on several occasions, and am able to report that the Regulations and By-laws made by the Council in 1905 have been in all cases complied with. The site of the new Mortuary for Wandsworth has not yet been decided on, and the matter is still under the consideration of the Public Health Committee. In Clapham, 38 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, compared with 51 in 1908; in Streatham 55, compared with 38; and in Wandsworth 113, of which 63 were from Wandsworth, 26 from Putney, and 24 from Tooting—a total of 206, compared with 204 in 1908. 160 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. General Sanitary Work in 1909. The following list shows the special inspections made by me during the year ;— (1.) An inspection was made of the land at Putney Vale Cemetery about to be purchased by the Council for an extension of the same, and the following report was submitted to the Burials Committee :— "10th May, 1909. "In accordance with your instructions, I have made an inspection of the land which it is proposed to add to the Putney Vale Cemetery, and have to report as follows :— "This land has a frontage of 469 feet on to Kingston Road, and is a continuation of the land which is at present used as a cemetery. The highest point of the land, which is close to Wimbledon Common, is about 90 feet above ordnance datum, and the lowest point, which is close to Kingston Road, is about 54 feet. "Generally speaking, the soil is a mixture of loam, gravel, and clay, with an average of 1 ft. 6 in. of mould on the surface. Seven trial holes have been dug, as shown on the plan drawn out by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, and these, on inspection, showed that, generally, the geological conditions are similar to those existing in the present Cemetery. In the trial holes, where water was found, the level of this averaged five feet from the surface, and I am of opinion that this is about the average of the ground water level in this locality. "There will be no difficulty in properly draining this ground to the depth necessary to render the graves dry, as there is a sewer in close proximity. "The ground water naturally flows towards Beverley Brook, the water level at that Brook being about 29½ Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 161 feet above ordnance datum and 800 yards distant from the land. "The nearest inhabited house is situated on the Portsmouth Road, and is about 100 yards distant, while Newlands Farm, which is at a lower level, is over 200 yards distant. "There are no sources of domestic water supply near the site, all the houses being supplied with water by the Southwark and Vauxhall District of the Metropolitan Water Board. "In my opinion, with proper drainage, the proposed site is suitable for a cemetery." (2.) As in previous years, special inspections were made of several localities in consequence of complaints of smells from road gullies and sewer ventilators. The number of complaints was much fewer than in the previous year, this having been due to the fact that the climatic conditions were unfavourable. In all 79 complaints were received, compared with 143 in 1908 : two from Clapham North, five from Clapham South, 16 from Putney, 15 from Streatham, 10 from Balham, nine from Tooting-, 14 from Southfield, four from Fairfield, and four from Spring-field Wards. All these complaints were forwarded to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, who reported that in every case the necessary cleansing and flushing or other work had been carried out. (3.) A large number of inspections were again made of passages and mews, and a considerable number of these have been satisfactorily dealt with during the year, but in some, owing to legal difficulties as to ownership, no work has yet been begun to comply with the notices served. 162 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (a) I he passage at the rear of Nos. 152-180, Streatham High Road, entering from Becmead Avenue, has been paved and drained in a satisfactory manner. (b) Roadway between Nos. 205 and 207, Brixton Hill has been repaired and the nuisance for the time has been abated. (c) Land at rear of Blackshaw Road. After prolonged inquiry, it was found that owing to difficulty of ascertaining the owners, as defined by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the matter was referred to the New Streets Committee, who are now dealing with it under the Metropolis Management Act. (d) Yards and passages at Rowlands Cottages and Young's Rents, Clapham, have been paved with concrete by the owners without service of notice, making a most desirable improvement in the sanitary condition of these premises. (e) Road from 8 to 20, Boundaries Road, Balham, has had several loads of hard core laid, but has not been paved or drained. The nuisance has for the present been abated, but will, in my opinion, recur. (f) Open space in rear of Market Parade, Balham. This has been covered with brick and hard core, with a top dressing of gravel. (g) Passageways at rear of 113 to 125, Lower Richmond Road, 1 to 21, Roskell Road, and 2 to 24, Salvin Road, Putney, have been properly paved with concrete. (h) Passageways at rear of 521 to 541, and 543 to 557, York Road, Wandsworth. These passageways are still under notice, although something has been done to abate the nuisance by depositing hard core on the surface. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 163 (i) Passageway at rear of 255 to 305, Garratt Lane has been paved with blue bricks and properly drained. (k) Passageway at 230 to 244, Earlsfield Road drained and paved with concrete. (I) Passageway at 146 to 154, Earlsfield Road has been tar paved. (m) Passageway at 576 to 582, Garratt Lane has been paved with concrete. (n) Passageway between 551 and 553, Garratt Lane is still under notice, but work will shortly be begun to erect new stables, and the passage will therefore be properly paved and drained. (o) Passageway at rear of 844 to 850, Garratt Lane has been satisfactorily concreted. (p) Passageway 250 to 255, LTpper Tooting Road has been drained and paved. (q) Passageway at rear of 62 to 72, Mitcham Road paved and channelled with granite setts. (r) Passageway at rear of 42 to 48, and 50 to 58, Trinity Road has been tar paved. (s) Other passages in Tooting have been dealt with and nuisance abated, viz., between 52 and 54, Moffatt Road, 19 and 31, Hazelhurst Road, and at rear of 838 and 842, Garratt Lane, and 828 to 832, Garratt Lane. (t) Entrance to Newman's Court and the passage to six houses in the same court have been properly paved. (u) The entrance to Acre Square and the passage to six houses in Acre Square have been properly paved. 164 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (v) Passageway at rear of Furzedown Market, Tooting, is at present under notice, and the necessary works will be carried out during the current year. (w) Field's Alley, Wandsworth. A portion of this passage was tar paved. (x) Passage at rear of shops in Mitcham Lane from Westcotc Road has been properly paved. The condition of these passages has been greatly improved in consequence of the works carried out, but there still remains a number in the Borough which will eventually have to be dealt with in the same manner.

Special house-to-house inspections were made during the year of premises in Young's Rents, Rowland's Cottages, Heath Road, Queen's Road, Pitcairn Street, Clapham; Isabella Place, Cox's Place, Bigg's Row, Bendermere Road, Putney; Colmer Road, Streatham; XVardley Street, Lydden Grove, Lydden Road, Bendon Valley, and Hill's Yard, Wandsworth. (5.) Special inspections were made also of the milkshops in the Borough, especially those where grocery goods were also sold, and a very desirable improvement has been carried out in a large number of these premises by the provision of a proper milk safe, so as to prevent as far as possible the pollution of the milk sold. In all, 200 visits were made to these premises, and Lam able to report that the conditions under which milk is now sold have been very greatly improved. Including the house-to-house inspections and inspections for certificates under the Revenue Act, but excluding the routine inspections of bakehouses, slaughter-houses, cowsheds, and offensive trade premises, 1,056 inspections were made of premises, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notices.

The total number of intimation notices served was 9,336, compared with 8,138 in 1908, 7,613 in 1907, and 7,500 in 1906, and of statutory notices 1,119, compared with 1,564, 1,100, and 1,044. The greatest number of intimation notices was served in Balham and Streatham Wards, and the smallest number in Southfield and Putney Wards. The greatest number of statutory notices was served in Balham and Springfield Wards, and the smallest number in Putney and Southfield Wards. 84 of the statutory notices served in 1909 were not complied with. The majority of these were served in December, and were complied with in the early months of the current year. The number of statutory notices served include By-law notices, 342 of which were served in respect of the following contraventions of the By-laws:-Yard paving; 143, repairs to water closets 64, repairs to (lushing apparatus of water closets 43, cleansing of water closets three, covers to cisterns 14, cleansing cisterns 14, cleansing house and other contraventions of the By-laws as to houses let in lodgings 43, paving and draining stables four, and absence of proper manure receptacles 14. The number of cases of overcrowding dealt with during the year was 131, compared with 158 in 1908, 87 in 1907, 100 in 1906, and 92 in 1905 14 of these were in Claphani, six in Putney, 29 in Streatham, 11 in Tooting, and 71 in Wandsworth. The cases of overcrowding in Clapham were chiefly in Milford Street and Lyham Road; in Putney, in Quill Lane and the Piatt; in Streatham, in Eardley Road, Larch Road, Zennor Road, and Foss Road; in Tooting, in Fairlight Road ; and in Wandsworth, in Guelph Street, Bendon Valley, and I.ydden Grove. 64 of the cases were caused by sub-letting rooms, largely in consequence of the original occupier being out of employment, and in the remainder of the cases the overcrowding was caused by the house being too small for the number in the family. All the cases were remedied without difficulty. 181 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 1,292 ashpits were provided or repaired, compared with 1,233 in 1908 and 1,099 in 1907, and 421 complaints with reference to the non-removal of house refuse (61 from Clapham, 46 from Putney, 185 from Streatham, 26 from Tooting, and 103 from Wandsworth) were received during' the year. These complaints were, as in previous years, attending to by the Dusting Inspectors. 1,574 yards in connection with dwelling-houses, and 95 in connection with stables, were paved, drained, or cleansed, compared with 1,025 and 135 in 1908. 7,301 rooms and 1,519 staircases and passages were cleansed or repaired, compared with 5,856 rooms and 1,327 staircases and passages in 1908. The greatest number of rooms cleansed was in the Balham W ard, where 1,411 were done, and in Streatham Ward, where 1,089 were done, and the smallest number in Putney and Southfield, where the numbers were 368 and 271 respectively. 1,041 drains were cleansed or repaired, and 53 rain-water pipes disconnected from the drains. 144 notices of reconstruction of drains were sent to the Borough Engineer from this Department : 34 in Clapham, compared with 18 in 1908; five in Putney, compared with nine; 51 in Streatham, compared with 41; 14 in Tooting, compared with 12; and 40 in Wandsworth, compared with 44. The total number of houses where the drains were reconstructed during the year was 307: 74 in Clapham, 22 in Putney, 121 in Streatham, 19 in Tooting, and 71 in Wandsworth. 347 accumulations of manure were removed after service of notice, compared with 361 in 1908: 75 in Clapham, 33 in Putney, 117 in Streatham, 35 in Tooting, and 87 in Wandsworth. There has been an increase in the number of cases dealt with in Clapham and Wandsworth, and a decrease in Putney, Streatham, and Tooting. 50 notices were served for the periodical removal of manure every 48 hours, compared with 55 in 1908, 33 in 1907, 16 in 1906, find 20 in 1905. 182 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of waterclosets cleansed and repaired was 2,128, compared with 1,809 in 1907 and 1,936 in 1906. The greatest number of these were in Balham and Springfield Wards. 837 drinking water cisterns were cleansed, covered, or repaired: 255 in Clapham, 32 in Putney, 157 in Streatham, 103 in Tooting, and 290 in Wandsworth, compared with 755 in 1908. 83 premises were inspected and notices served where animals were kept in such a manner as to be a nuisance. Nine of these were in Clapham, one in Putney, 24 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 40 in Wandsworth. This nuisance was most common in Balham and Springfield Wards, and the animals kept were chiefly ducks and hens. 58 smoke nuisanqes were reported during the year : two in Clapham, two in Putney, six in Streatham, three in Tooting, and 45 in Wandsworth. Three complaints of black smoke were received from the Public Control Department of the London County Council with regard to three premises, and seven complaints from the Coal Smoke Abatement Society with regard to 14 premises. These complaints were all at once attended to and the premises kept under observation. 182 soil pipes were repaired, 36 in Clapham, 56 in Putney, 44 in Streatham, 23 in Tooting, and 23 in Wandsworth, compared with 125 in 1908, 184 in 1907, and 185 in 1906. 1,159 leaky roofs and gutters were repaired, compared with 945 in 1908. 46 unwholesome or dilapidated houses were cleansed and repaired, two in Clapham, two in Putney, 16 in Streatham, 13 in Tooting, and 13 in Wandsworth, compared with 97 in 1908. A large amount of work has been carried out to abate nuisances arising from damp conditions. In all 746 premises have been dealt with, 101 in Clapham, 19 in Putney, 334 in Streatham, 183 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 60 in Tooting, and 232 in Wandsworth; and in 115 of these, 15 in Clapham, 51 in Streatham, 12 in Tooting, and 37 in Wandsworth, damp courses have been inserted. The number of unclassified nuisances was 719, 223 in Clapham, 49 in Putney, 263 in Streatham, 49 in Tooting', and 135 in Wandsworth, compared with 863 in 1908. Removal of House Refuse. No change has taken place in the methods of removal or disposal of house refuse during- the year, details of which have been given in previous reports. During the 12 months ending March, 1909, the quantity of dust collected and disposed of was approximately 61,331 tons, compared with 58,623 tons in the previous year, and the total cost of collection and disposal was £.16,573, compared with £16,288. 140 statutory notices were served under section 37 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to provide ashpits in accordance with the By-laws, and these have been complied with. Disinfection. The total number of rooms disinfected after the occurrence of cases of infectious disease was 3,146 (507 in Clapham, 210 in Putney, 1,000 in Streatham, 474 in Tooting, and 955 in Wandsworth), compared with 2,868 in 1908, 3,206 in 1907, and 2,794 'n 1906. The increase was chiefly due to the increase in the number of disinfections carried out after Measles and Consumption. 1,581 lots of bedding were stoved at the Disinfecting Station, compared with 1,826 in 1908, 1,948 in 1907, and 1,669 in 1906. 184 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The 1,581 lots of bedding included the following 1—985 beds, 1,044 bolsters, 2,694 pillows, 1,110 mattresses, 509 palliasses, 1,773 sheets, 1,625 quilts, 683 cushions, 4,883 articles of clothing, 3,087 blankets, 174 carpets, and 2,276 extra articles, a total of 20,843 articles, compared with 24,034 in 1908, 29,102 in 1907, and 28,885 in 1906. 1,012 premises were disinfected after Measles and 255 after Tubercular disease of the Lungs, compared with 884 and 184 in 1908. 24 beds, nine bolsters, 27 pillows, 26 mattresses, 37 palliasses, eight sheets, four quilts, 21 cushions, 96 articles of clothing, 14 blankets, five carpets, and 80 extra articles, were removed and destroyed by request of the owners during the year. Disinfection was also carried out by the Sanitary Staff at premises after non-notifiable diseases, chiefly Cancer, and the sum of £20 10s. od. was received for such disinfection. 68 rooms were disinfected in consequence of their verminous condition, two rooms were sprayed, and five lots of verminous bedding disinfected. The disinfection by steam was carried out at the Station at Tooting, and I am pleased to report that this Station has proved most satisfactory in every way. I have regularly visited the Station during the year, and am able to report that the work has been carried out by the staff to my entire satisfaction. Only three complaints of damage to goods by disinfection have been received, and on inquiry it was found that the goods were damaged or stained before being placed in the disinfecting chamber. • The approximate cost of working and maintaining the Disinfecting Station during the past year, including the cost of disinfectants used in fumigating and cleasing rooms, was as follows ;— 185 Report of the Medical Officer of Heulth. £ s. d.

Cost per lot of bedding 15s. 5d. Cleansing of Persons Act. The baths at the Disinfecting Station have not been so frequently used this year, chiefly owing to the smaller number of verminous children dealt with. The names of 107 children, 12 belonging- to Clapham, seven to Putney, 13 to 'Streatham, 12 to Tooting, and 63 to W andsworth, stated to be in a verminous condition, were forwarded to me by the Medical Officer, Education Department, London County Council, and the homes were visited by the Inspectors. In the majority of cases only the heads of the children were verminous, but in a considerable number the bodies and clothing were also verminous. Of these latter, 12, six boys and six girls, were cleansed at the baths, and the clothing was at the same time stoved with beneficial results. 23 adults also had baths, six being nurses who had been in attendance 011 cases of Puerperal Fever, 16 were contacts with cases of Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria, while one female was verminous. 186 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Inspection of Urinals in connection with Licensed Premises. The number of urinals inspected was 175, 36 in Clapham, 21 in Putney, 49 in Streatham, 13 in Tooting, and 56 in Wandsworth. 400 inspections were made during the year and 47 notices, chiefly for clcansing, were served and complied with. Police Court Proceedings. The list which follows shows particulars of Police Court proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the year. The total amount of fines inflicted was £30 17s. 6d., and the costs £11 3s., compared with £27 4s. and £11 11s. in 1908. The majority of the cases were with respect to nuisances or contraventions of By-laws, but eight were for permitting houses to be occupied without first having obtained a certificate from the Sanitary Authority that the premises had a proper and sufficient supply of water. One case was for exposing decomposed meat for sale, one for obstructing the Sanitary Inspector, one for failing to notify a case of Puerperal Fever, and seven for selling milk without being registered as required by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885. 187 Report of the Medical Officer of Health TABLE LXXX.

Mortuaries— Total number of bodies removed 206 Total number of infectious bodies removed — Milkshops. At the close of 1908 there were 367 milkshops 011 the Register, 38 have been added in 1909 and 94 removed, leaving' 331 on the Register at the end of 1909. During the year 1,365 inspections were made of these premises and 57 notices, chiefly for cleansing, were served. Seven prosecutions were instituted for carrying on the business of a dairyman without being registered, and fines amounting to £4 2s. were imposed, with 12s. costs. The magistrate dismissed one of the cases on the ground that the vendor had been previously registered in this Borough, and that although he had left, the Sanitary Authority had no power to remove his name from the Register. The increase in the number of inspections of milkshops was due to special inspections made in consequence of powers given to the Sanitary Authority under Section 5 of the London General Powers Act, and, in addition to these inspections, I made 154 inspections before reporting the cases to the Public Health Committee. In 36 eases, nine in Clapham, three in Putney, five in Streatham, five in Tooting, and 14 in Wandsworth, where grocery goods, potatoes, etc., were also sold the occupier voluntarily cancelled the registration, while in 99 cases proper milk safes (23 in Clapham, five in Putney, 10 in Streatham, 13 in Tooting, and 48 in Wandsworth), were provided. These safes have proved very satisfactory in preventing the pollution of the milk, and in many instances the occupiers express themselves as being thoroughly satisfied that their provision has effected a decided improvement. 192 Report of the Mcdical Officer of Health.

During 1909 46 were added and 23 removed, leaving a total of 274 on the Register. 433 inspections were made of these premises during the year and 46 notices were served, all of which were fof cleansing. 196 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Houses Let in Lodgings. At the eud of 1908 there were 267 houses let in lodgings on the Register. Eight were added during 1909 and none removed, making a total of 275 on the Register at the end of 1909. 722 inspections of these were made during the year, and 460 notices were served, 31 for overcrowding and 429 for other conditions, chiefly cleansing. With regard to one premises a summons was issued for failing to cleanse, and a conviction was obtained. The Housing, Town Planning Act, etc., 1909, has now definitely placed the responsibility of cleansing on the owner of the premises, and in future the difficulty of deciding as to the person liable will not arise. On the whole the By-laws have been satisfactorily complied with, although in some instances the cleansing was not carried out at the specified time. Offensive Trade Refuse. No complaints have been received during the year as to the removal of the above refuse, and I am able to report that the arrangement entered into by the Council has been satisfactorily carried out by the Contractor. Unsound Food. During the year 1 box of Haddocks, 2 boxes of Herrings, 1 case of Cat-fish, 3 cases of Hake, 2 boxes of Cod, 6 boxes of Kippers, 1 trunk of Skate, 1 case of Soles, 2 boxes of Mackerel, 2 boxes of Fillets, 1 case of Apples, 1½ bushels Cherries, 7 baskets of Strawberries, ½ bushel of Black Currants, 1 case of Bananas, ½ bushel of Plums, 33 boxes of Tomatoes, 4 sacks of Peas, 1 sack of Carrots, 7 bags of Broccoli, 5 Rabbits and 1 carcase of Beef were destroyed at the request of the owners, and the usual certificates granted. 197 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Factories and Workshops. I am able to report that during the year 1909 there has been a considerable increase in the amount of work carried out by the Inspectors under the Factory and Workshops Act, and also that the condition of all the factories ;md workshops in the Borough is satisfactory. There has again been some difficulty experienced in regard to the lists of outworkers, and it was found necessary in one case to take proceedings when the occupier was fined for failing to keep a register of outworkers as required by the Act. It was also necessary to issue circular letters to many employers reminding them of the necessity of sending in these lists, and also that the official form should be used for this purpose. The Tables which follow are similar to those used in previous Reports, and the whole of the work done by both male and female Inspectors is there shown in a concise form. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,657, including 140 retail bakehouses, 150 workshop laundries, 313 dressmakers' and milliners' premises, and 1,054 other workshops, but not including 351 factories, 985 workplaces, and 312 outworkers' premises. Including all factories, workshops, workplaces, and outworkers' premises, there were on the Register at the end of 1909 3,305 premises, compared with 3,347 in 1908, 3,281 in 1907, 3,096 in 1906, 3,045 in 1905, 2,987 in 1904, and 2,676 in 1903. The total number of inspections made during the year was 6,531, compared with 5,801 in 1908, 6,048 in 1907, 5,997 111 190O, 4,933 in 1905, and 4,946 in 1904. The total number of notices served was 597, 549 intimation and 48 statutory, compared with 434 in 1908, 453 in 1907, 427 in 1906, 462 in 1905, and 465 in 1904. o 198 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There were two prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for sanitary defects, and one under the Factory and Workshop Act for failing to keep a register of outworkers. Under the head of other workshops are included domestic workshops, and under the head of places where food is prepared for sale are included the kitchens of hotels, restaurants, tripe, fried fish and eel shops, and other places where food is prepared for sale. In all 817 inspections were made of 351 factories, and 74 notices, 69 intimation and five statutory, were served. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,657, 150 of which were workshop laundries, 140 workshop bakehouses, and 1,367 other workshops. In all 3,366 inspections of these were made, compared with 3,130 in 1908, 3,148 in 1907, 3,233 in 1906, and 2,628 in 1905, and 276 intimation and 23 statutory notices were served. The total number of workplaces on the Register was 985, and 1,902 inspections were made, while 163 intimation and 20 statutory notices were served. The total number of defects found was 745, including six cases in which there was a breach of special sanitary requirements for bakehouses, compared with 609 and 16 in 1908. To abate these nuisances 549 intimation and 48 statutory notices were served, all of which, with the exception of 30, were complied with at the end of the year. The 30 outstanding were complied with, with two exceptions, in the first month of this year. These two exceptions were two laundries which were given up shortly after service of the notices. In all, 745 defects were found and 720 remedied, but only 549 intimation notices were served, as one notice frequently called attention to several defects on the same premises. 199 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The table which follows and which relates to Home Work is similar to the one in last year's Report. There has been an increase of four in the number of lists sent in twice a year, and a decrease of nine in the number sent in once a year. 202 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In all, 152 lists were received twice in the year, containing the names and addresses of 56 contractors and 612 workers, and six lists once in the year, containing the names and addresses of 13 workers. The total number of addresses received from other Councils was 370, compared with 352 in 1908, 322 in 1907, and 173 in 1906, and 334 addresses were forwarded to other Councils, compared with 301 in 1908, 325 in 1907, and 122 in 1906. The following- are the districts to which lists of outworkers were forwarded, and also the number of outworkers : Battersea 85, Lambeth 69, Stepney 46, Fulham 15, Southwark 14, City of London 10, Croydon and Merton nine each, Camberwell eight, East Ham and Chelsea six each, Hammersmith and Islington five each, Bermondsey, Westminster, St. Pancras and Bethnal Green four each, Ilford, Stratford and Poplar three each, Stoke Newington, Woolwich, Chiswick, Willesden, Shoreditch and Southampton two each, Hampstead, Hackney, Lewisham, Finsbury, Wimbledon, Holborn, Twickenham, Bromley, Surbiton and Hove one each. 99 names and addresses were forwarded to this Borough in error and are not included in the above Table. The number of notices sent to employers during the year was .27, and these had a most satisfactory result, although in some ases it was also necessary for the Inspector to call and warn them that if such lists were not sent proceedings would be taken. At the end of 1908 there were 331 outworkers' premises on the Register, 99 were added and 118 removed during the year, leaving 312 on the Register. 446 inspections were made of these premises during the year, and 41 notices, all for cleansing, were served and complied with. During the year only six cases of infectious disease, four of Scarlet Fever and two of Diphtheria, were notified as having occurred in the homes of outworkers, compared with 22 in 1908, six in 1907, six in 1906, and five in 1905. 203 CLASSIFICATION AND NUMBER OF BOOKS IN STOCK.

The Table shows the work done in each sub-district and is grouped under five divisions: (1) factories, (2) workshops, (3) domestic workshops, (4) workplaces, and (5) outworkers' premises. The total number of inspections was 3,175, compared with .2,263 in 1908, 2,408 in 1907 and 1,964 in 1906, and re-inspections 1,184, compared with 1,394, 1,298 and 1,649. 961 of the inspections and 159 of the re-inspections were in Clapham, 508 and 10 in Putney, 655 and 304 in Streatham, 242 and 45 in Tooting-, and 809 and 669 in Wandsworth. Six workshops where males were employed were notified to H.M. Inspector, and 22 were reported to this Council by H.M. Inspector. In all the workshops under the supervision of the male Inspectors only three cases of overcrowding' were discovered, and these were at once remedied. 206 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of premises inspected was 1814 (365 in Clapham, 243 in Putney, 516 in Streatham, 117 in Tooting, and 573 in Wandsworth). 209 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 186 inspections were made of factories, 1,008 of workshops, 61 of domestic workshops, 351 of workplaces, and 208 of outworkers' premises, while 377 premises were visited for inquiry and no workroom found. There were only two cases of overcrowding discovered, compared with four in 1908, four in 1907, five in 1906, 12 in 1905, and 17 in 1904, and these were at once abated. 56 were found to be in a dirty condition, compared with 25 in 1908, and 66 in 1907. In two factories and one workshop the sanitary accommodation was insufficient. Two of these were remedied during the year 1909, while one, for which notice was served in December, was remedied in January of the present year. In every workshop inspected during the year there were separate water closets for the sexes, but in six factories and 34 workshops the water closets were defective. Other nuisances were discovered in four factories, 20 workshops, 17 workplaces, and seven outworkers' premises, and these have all been abated. It was only necessary to serve 113 intimation notices, and these were all complied with with the exception of 13, five in Clapham, three in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth. These notices were complied with in the beginning of the current year. It was not necessary to serve any statutory notices during the year. 104 workshops and eight domestic workshops where females were employed were reported to H.M. Inspectors of Workshops, and 113 were reported to this Council by H.M. Inspector. Only 18 of the workshops reported by H.M. Inspector were unknown to the Sanitary Inspectors. The other 95 had been previously reported by me, or were already on the Register. 210 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XC. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth Borough.

The number of workrooms in workshops is also shown. The factories and workshops are divided into dressmakers' and milliners' premises, laundries, and miscellaneous premises; and the workplaces are divided into laundries and miscellaneous premises. Of the total number of factories where women are employed, 73 are laundries and 19 other factories, while of the total workshops, viz.:—519, 313 are dressmakers and milliners, 150 laundries 212 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. and 56 other workshops, an increase of four other workshops, and one laundry, compared with 1908, while the number of dressmakers and milliners premises remained the same. The total number of workplaces on the register is 265, a decrease of 29 compared with 1908, of which 70 are laundries, and 195 miscellaneous premises, chiefly dressmakers and milliners. 213 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

As in 1908, there has again been a slight decrease in the numbers, chiefly due to dullness of trade, and also to the fact that several small laundries which were classed as workplaces have now been given up, there being only 69 of these now on the Register, compared with 85 in 1908, and 132 in 1907. The number of dressmakers and milliners shows some reduction compared with previous years. The total number, viz.:— 849 (169 in Clapham, 110 in Putney, 280 in Streatham, 69 in Tooting, and 221 in Wandsworth), is 38 less than in 1908, the greatest decrease having occurred in Streatham. 2'5 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

During the year 39 inspections of Canal Boats were made, but no notices were served. The condition of all the boats inspected was reported to be satisfactory. 2l6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Statement of Work done under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. During the past year 1,030 samples of foods and drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, compared with 1,004 in 1908, 989 in 1907, and 905 in 1906. Of these, 71 or 6.89 per cent. were reported to be adulterated, compared with 8.76 per cent, in 1908, 8.49 per cent. in 1907, and 9.29 in 1906. The percentage of milk samples found to be adulterated was 7.39, compared with 6.9 in 1908, 10 97 in 1907, and 10 26 in 1906. In 18 of the adulterated milk samples the Public Health Committee, after considering the amount of adulteration and the circumstances of the sale, decided not to prosecute the vendor, so that the percentage of prosecutions was only 4.0, compared with 3.8 in 1908, and 5.9 in 1907. In 44 out of the 71 cases in which adulterations were detected proceedings were instituted against the vendor, compared with 50 in 1908, and 52 in 1907. The total amount received in penalties under the above Acts during the year amounted to £63 os. 6d., and the costs to £29 4s. 6d., making a total of £92 5s., compared with £118 9s. 6d. in 1908. 217 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

As will be seen from the above Table the average amount of adulteration detected during the 10 years 1899-1908 was 9.3 per cent., whereas during 1909 the adulteration detected was 6.89. From these figures it would appear that the food supply of this Borough has improved, but this may, to some extent, be accounted for by the fact (hat in 1909 there was a decided decrease in the adulteration found in samples of meats and other groceries taken during the year. The system which has been adopted by the Council of allowing the Inspector to provide his own assistants still works economically and well. During the past year no less than nine different assistants, including three women and two boys, have been engaged at various times to make purchases of food for analysis. The following Table shows the number of samples taken in each sub-district of the Borough, together with the number per 1,000 of population, the number of adulterations detected, and the percentage of adulterations.

More samples were taken in Tooting as it was known that a number of purveyors of separated milk who lived outside the Borough were selling this article as milk, and the percentage of adulterations found shows that to a large extent these milk sellers were detected and convictions were obtained. 21 samples of milk have been taken in course of delivery at the various Public Institutions in the Borough, and these upon analysis proved to be genuine. 10 samples of milk were taken at various Railway Stations in the Borough. In taking these samples the Inspector awaits the arrival of the milk train and takes the sample of milk from the churns as they are being unloaded from the train. Only one of the 10 samples taken proved on analysis to be adulterated. Three samples of milk were taken after complaint at private houses in the Borough, and in every case the milk proved to be adulterated. Proceedings were taken against the vendors of these samples and penalties were imposed. The following Table shows the results of the analyses of the samples as above stated at the various Public Institutions, Railway Stations, and private premises, and the percentage of adulteration in each case.

I had been informed that at many of the public-houses in the Borough ginger beer was being served from the engine or counter pump, with a lead pipe communicating with the ginger beer in the barrel. 1 had several samples taken, which proved on analysis to contain metallic lead to such an extent that the continued consumption of the ginger beer would have produced symptoms of lead poisoning. The Public Health Committee recommended that the following notice should be sent to all persons in the Borough who sold ginger beer, drawing their attention to the danger of serving it from the engine:— 224 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "5th August, 1909. "The attention of the Medical Officer of Health has been called to the fact that ginger beer is being sold from barrels stored in cellars with lead communicating pipes to the engine on the counter. As there is serious risk of the ginger beer being contaminated with lead and thus causing lead poisoning this practice should, in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, be at once discontinued." The Inspector when visiting the premises where notice had been given, reported to me that most of the vendors had discontinued the above practice, but in some instances where it had not been given up the Inspector obtained samples, which proved on analysis to contain metallic lead, and in one case the vendor was proceeded against, and although the magistrate only ordered the defendant to pay costs, yet in my opinion the prosecution had a salutary effect in giving publicity to the matter. The amount of metallic lead found in four of the samples taken was as follows: 3.3 grains per gallon, 1.5 grains per gallon, 1.05 grains per gallon, and .42 grains per gallon. In perusing Table XCIX. it will be noticed that the item under Cereals shows a large amount of adulteration. This was caused by the number of samples of rice found to be adulterated, the adulteration consisting of an excess of mineral matter (talc or steatite), used for polishing" the rice and giving it a white appearance. The following circular letter was issued by this Council and delivered to all the grocers and others who sell rice in the Borough, calling their attention to this practice:— "Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. "The attention of the Wandsworth Borough Council has been called to the large amount of mineral matter in samples of rice which have been submitted to the Public Analyst, which mineral matter consists wholly of talc or steatite, used for polishing the rice and giving it a white appearance. As rice is a diet that is frequently prescribed for infants and 225 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. invalids, the Council wishes to point out that such polishing is unnecessary, and hereby gives notice that the question of taking proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act will be considered in any cases in which it is found that the amount of mineral matter mixed with or added to the surface of the rice is excessive. "Hen. Geo. Hills, Town Clerk. "Council House, Wandsworth, S.W., "13th December, 1909." In four of the samples of rice taken the amount of extraneous matter, that is, mineral matter removed from the surface of the grain, was as follows: 104 per cent., .87 per cent., .79 per cent., and '66 per cent. The Inspector has on many occasions reported to me the difficulty of dealing with the increasing number of peripatetic milk vendors who come into the Borough from the surrounding districts, and most of whom carry two sorts of milk, viz.:—new and separated milk, on the same barrow. The following instance was one of several brought to my notice. A vendor, residing outside the Borough, was seen selling milk from a barrow on which the words "Pure New Milk Supply" was printed in large letters. The Inspector when taking a sample for analysis accosted the vendor, who was calling out "Lovely New Milk," and asked for a half-pint of milk. The vendor proceeded to serve the Inspector from a quart can, and on enquiring what milk was on the barrow found that there was only about one pint of new milk, but about 30 gallons of separated milk. A sample which was taken of the separated milk proved on analysis to contain 30 per cent. of added water. Proceedings were instituted against the vendor, but before the summons was served he had absconded. In any future legislation with regard to milk, it is, in my opinion, desirable that some stringent regulations should be made to control the sale of separated milk, as it is at present well known that this article is sold to the poor as genuine new milk, 226 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the official report of the Local Government Hoard it is stated that the heavy adulteration practised 30 years ago has practically disappeared, but if we judge by the number of samples which arc reported as poor, or as just reaching the standard of three per cent, of fat, all of which have to be returned as genuine, it seems that the practice of depriving good milk of a large proportion of its cream so that it may just escape condemnation by the Public Analyst is on the increase. This method of systematically reducing the quality of the milk is known as "toning," and it will be seen that a large profit can be made, without risk, when the milk is thus impoverished Some magistrates appear to consider the limit of fat fixed by the regulations as representing milk of an average quality, and regard all milk coming within five to 10 per cent, of that limit as passable, but it must be remembered that milk of good average quality contains more nearly 3.5 per cent, of fat than the 3 per cent, fixed as the standard During the year attention has again been directed to procuring samples on Friday and Saturday nights, and also to sampling milk early in the morning. 1 have also to report that in two cases only have summonses been dismissed owing to the defendant pleading the "warranty defence." One case was reported and a summons issued for refusing to serve the Inspector when requested, and the defendant was heavily fined. I would also call attention to the fact that of the 40 cases of milk reported against, 25 had a deficiency in the amount of milk fat, 14 had extraneous water, and one had both. Of the 14 cases where extraneous water was found, five were separated milk. This shows, as was mentioned in my Report for 1908, that adulteration with water is not so prevalent as it was some years ago, when the addition of water was the most common method of adulteration. In 1891 for example, of 15 samples of milk analysed all were adulterated with water, in 1892, of 17 samples all were adulterated with water, in 1893, of 16 samples, 14 had added water Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 227 and four fat abstracted. In each succeeding- year the proportion of cases where fat had been abstracted shows an increase. I am also able to report that the Inspector who was appointed to carry out this work during the year has done so in a very satisfactory manner. I have also much pleasure in reporting that the rest of the staff, both clerical and inspectorial, have performed their duties to my entire satisfaction. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX.
