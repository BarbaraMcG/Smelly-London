WHI 44 THE ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, (WITH VITAL AND OTHER STATISTICS), FOR THE YEAH 1899, (CONSISTING OF 52 WEEKS), being the SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT, by JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH; diplomate in public health, university of cambridge; fellow of the incorporated society of medical officers of health; associate of the college of state medicine; member of the sanitary institute; public vaccinator to the whitechipel union; examiner in, and instructor of vaccination, by order of the local government board; &c. LONDON: PRINTED BY GEORGE STRVENS & CO., Ltd. 113, Middlesex Street, Bishopsgate, E.C. 1900. Presented to the Board on the 25th January. 19OO. Offices of the Board of Works for the Whiteohapel District. Public Health Department : No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E., January 11th, 1900. To the Chairman and Members of the Whitechapel District Board of Works. Gentlemen, Nearly seventeen years have passed since I was appointed by your Board, and became responsible for the supervision of the Public Health Work of the District. Many changes have taken place since then, several of which I propose to briefly consider. Many houses existed in the year 1883 which have been replaced by dwellings better suited for occupation by the Working Classes. Under the provisions of the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Acts a good deal of vacant land existed upon which now stand dwellings which afford a splendid contrast to those which formerly existed. Not only have many parts of the District became thus changed, but the population as well have become altered in character and in nationality. As it is possible that this may be my last Annual Health Report (it certainly will be my last as the Medical Officer of your Board) I thought that it would be interesting to most members, and perhaps it might afford information to some, if I were to devote a few lines, and also a comprehensive Table, to explain some of those changes which have taken place. The Census Returns of 1891 gave evidence of the enormous increase in the Foreign population which had taken place during the preceding ten years. In my opinion that increase has been maintained. At the present time a stranger might readily imagine some parts of our District to belong to a Continental City. The general result from a Public Health point of view of this increase in the Foreign population has been to call for much greater vigilance on the part of your Officers, for I am compelled to admit that neither the owners of houses in the Foreign portions of the District, nor the Tenants themselves, are inclined voluntarily to exert themselves to maintain their property in the best approved condition. It was at first thought that the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 94, would have proved most useful in this direction. I anticipated when that class of property which I am now considering was registered, that it would become a simple matter to enforce the provisions of the byelaws which were made under that Section, and which were approved by the Local Government Board. There was a stumbling-block, however, in the exemption clause which permitted the very places to escape registration for which the clause had evidently been framed, merely because higher rents were imposed than allowed them to be included upon the Register for "Houses let in Lodgings and occupied by members of more than one Family." 4 Your Board recently had this question under discussion. After much consideration a representation was made to the Local Government Board for permission to amend the exemption clause of the 94th Section of the Act. The necessity of a change was so apparent that the approval of the Local Government Board was at once given to your proposal, so that houses are now liable to registration where the lodger rental does not exceed seven shillings and sixpence per week for unfurnished apartments, and fifteen shillings per week where the apartments are let furnished. The latter case concerns the District to a very limited extent. The effect of this modification will be that many more additions will be made to the Register, and probably in time the services of an Inspector may be required to permit such dwellings to receive sufficient visitation. Such houses, liable as they undoubtedly are, to all the evils produced by overcrowding, should be inspected, if possible, weekly. During the year under consideration, I have become aware in the hundreds of houses I have myself inspected, of instances where part of a two or three-roomed tenement has been sub-let to others by the tenant. Only persistent regular inspection can cope with such a practice. I am somewhat concerned for the Public Health Work in the future of our own section of the new Municipality which will commence its official life in November of the present year 1900. I do not desire to disparage the good work which is being performed by the other Districts to which we are to be united, but in many ways Whitechapel differs from the others. It employs a much larger staff of Inspectors in comparison with its population than does any of the others, and yet I feel sure no one will think that too many are engaged in the work which is required, having consideration for the class of dwellings and the inhabitants who live in them. With other good movements in the District, I am not now directly concerned, but we may well be proud of our Destructor Works, and the Electric Lighting Installation; of our well constructed Baths and Washouses; of our Free Library and Museum; of the Art Gallery, now approaching completion; of the methods for the collection and disposal of refuse from the streets and from the houses, as well as of our Public Mortuary and Coroner's Court; our open spaces, too, are worthy of note. In the partnership now so soon to take place, Whitechapel will, at least, contribute most valuable assets. Probably no part of old London has, during the past twenty years, been able to show more general improvements. In exchanging new buildings for old worn out dwellings, as well as in comprehensive schemes of improved drainage, a great advance has taken place. I invite attention to the Report which I prepared by your direction for the London County Council, and also to the Tables which I appended to that Report. The latter I have extended so as to include the past twenty years. These statements are placed at the end of this Report. What have all these changes done for the general good of the District ? How do we know, that apart from improved appearance, the result has justified the expenditure ? Let me merely draw attention to the comparative death-rate as a sufficient reply. In the year 1879 the Whitechapel District death-rate was stated to be 26.0 per 1,000. At the present time it is 19.3 per 1,000. This in itself is of course most satisfactory, but it becomes still more so when the difference between our death-rate and that for the entire Metropolis is compared for the two periods. These figures I may set out as follows;— 1879. 1899. London (including Whitechapel) 23.3 19.7 per 1,000 The Whitechapel District 26.0 19.3 „ 5 Again—that the outlay has been well justified is proved by the significant fact that whereas the general London Zymotic death-rate for 1899 equalled 3.l per 1,000; that for our own District was only 2.1 per 1,000. Here is to be found proof that a policy such as your Board in the past has adopted has resulted in a considerable saving of human life. With this brief preface I now commence the consideration of matters more nearly concerned in an annual Report on the Sanitary condition of the Whitechapel District. It would, however, ill become me to issue the Report without expressing my deepest obligation to your Board for the many kindnesses and acts of concession which I have experienced during the years I have acted as your Medical Officer. From time to time it has been my duty to ask for more help: I have never asked in vain. Once you have appreciated the arguments I have brought forward, a ready acquiescence has followed. This, coupled, with the loyalty of my staff, and their devotion to duty, has made my work a pleasure from its very start. The assistance and advice of my Colleagues, the Clerks, and the Surveyor of your Board also demand a warm recognition at my hands. The Whitechapel District over which your Board has had control for Public Health and other purposes for 44 years, consists of some 22 miles of streets; it has an area of 406 statute acres (including 23 acres of water); it contains an estimated population of 85,000 persons of all ages; it possesses about 9,000 inhabited houses; and its rateable value for the present year is stated to be £447,516. Up to the present time about one half of the inhabited houses have been specially inspected, that is to say particulars of every part of each house are entered in a book which is properly indexed. Measurements are accurately recorded, details as to sanitary provisions, water supply, paving of yard, and general condition of the house are carefully registered. The drains are also tested. It is the last mentioned item which causes the work to proceed so slowly, because in an enormous number of cases the drains have to be reconstructed. All such work receives a daily visit from the Inspector so as to prevent the covering over of imperfectly laid or carelessly made drains. It is clear, therefore, that such extra work occupies a large portion of the time of your Inspectors, but the tabulated record of such useful work is to my mind of the utmost value. The marriages which took place within the Whitechapel District during the year numbered 505. Last year they amounted to 512, and in the two previous years they were respectively 504 and 434. The total births which were registered in the three Sub-registration Districts during the 52 weeks of the year 1899, amounted to 3,005, as compared with 3,125 for the year 1898. In the Whitechapel Infirmary 124 births took place. Of this number 26 were the children of women who had not previously resided in the District. Distributing the remaining births between the Sub-registration Districts to which the mothers belonged, the correct apportionment of births was as follows:— Spitalfields. Mile End New Town. Goodman's Fields. Total. 1092 1202 685 2979 So that the number of births as corrected amounted to 2,979, viz., 1,516 boys, and 1,463 girls. See Table A* of the Appendix. *Page 30. 6 The District birth-rate equalled 35.0 per 1,000. The Metropolitan birth-rate equalled 29.2 per 1,000, I have based those calculations which require it upon the assumed population of 85,000 persons of all ages living in the District. The total deaths which were registered during the year numbered 2,650, viz. :—1,528 males, and 1,122 females. Table B* of the Appendix shows the deaths which were registered in each Sub-registration District. I am unable to contrast these results accurately with those of previous years, so far as concerns separate Districts, because a re-arrangement of Sub-registration Districts was initiated by the Registrar General at the commencement of the year, according to the plan recorded in my last Report. A deduction has now to be made of those deaths to the number of 1,222, which occurred among non-Residents (mostly in the London Hospital); and then to the remaining sum must be added the deaths of those Residents who died in Outlying Public Institutions, or elsewhere outside the District. These deaths numbered 216, against 203 for the previous year. The places where the deaths were registered are tabulated in the Appendix as usual—Table Dt. The corrected number of District deaths for the year 1899 was 1,644, or 68 more than was the case in 1898. Males died to the number of 901; 743 females died. A death-rate for the year of 19.3 per 1,000 is to be recorded, being .4 lower than was the case in the preceding year. The Metropolitan death-rate equalled 19.7 per 1,000 or 1.1 per 1,000 higher than was the case in 1898. It must be explained that these numbers are taken from figures which have not been perfectly corrected in the manner in which I have been able to correct our own District figures. The excess of births over deaths for the year 1899 was 1,335. In the four preceding years, it was for each year respectively, 1,532, 1,548, 1,554, and 1,308. The ages at death of the Residents who died during the year are recorded in Table F§ of the Appendix. The percentage of deaths for each Age period was as follows :— 26.6% of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 13.6,, ,, between the ages of 1 and 5. 4.6,, ,, ,, 5 and 20. 13.0,, ,, ,, 20 and 40. 20.4,, ,, ,, 40 and 60. 18.4 ,, ,, ,, 60 and 80. 3.1,, ,, over the age of 80 years. Compared with previous years it will be noticed that fewer infants, but more old persons, died in 1899 than was the case in the previous year. Compared with the Metropolitan deaths (including Whitechapel) the Infant deaths were as follows :— The deaths of infants under the age of one year in London equalled 24.2 per cent. of the total deaths, and 16.6 per cent. of the registered births. In * Page 30. † Page 31. § Page 32. 7 the Whitechapel District those Infants who died under the age of one year equalled 266 per cent. of the total deaths, and 14.7 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were for London, equal to 86.9 per cent. of the total deaths, and 24.9 per cent. of the registered births. In the Whitechapel District they were equal to 40.2 percent. of the total deaths, and 22.2 per cent. of the registered births. For comparison purposes I have extracted a few figures from a Table prepared by the Registrar-Geueral. From a Public Health point of view these records are of great value. Our District again occupies the best position in the list. The Tower of London deaths are included in those for the Whitechapel District, although for rating purposes it is " extra-parochial."

It is a course so generally adopted and universally approved that only the absence of a correct map of the District can excuse their absence from any modern Health Report. I have to offer as a substitute the Street List, which will be found to contain the chief Zymotic diseases set out in alphabetical form. It is in the Appendix. See Table 0*. A crude number of figures without some guide to their meaning being of slight value, I have introduced Table I. to enable the reader to readily contrast the mortality per cent. from each class of disease, to total deaths for Whitechapel, and also for the Metropolis as a whole. An experience in this way is presented similar to that recorded in former years. Many of the diseases are fairly balanced in the two columns. In both the Respiratory and the Constitutional Class, Whitechapel, suffers by comparison, but it gains considerably in that most important class which is known as ' preventible disease,' the ' Zymotic' or ' germ ' class of diseases. *Page 37 8 Three deaths were registered during the year from Small-pox. One of these deaths was credited to Whitechapel. The patient was a traveller whose business took him between Paris and Jerusalem. He felt ill upon arriving in Paris, and he therefore hastened to some friends living in Davis' Mansions. These people at once took him to the German Hospital, From there he was sent to the Metropolitan Asylums' Board Hospital Ship, where he shortly afterwards died from ' Hœmorrhagic Small-pox.' In the last two weeks of the year the Hospital Ships contained 12 persons suffering from Small-pox. While I am writing this part of my Report over 30 cases are under treatment. Influenza has again been epidemic in London, and has been responsible for many deaths, and Whitechapel has not escaped the visitation. The disease assumes many types. Scarcely two epidemics present the same symptoms. Generally, however, some chest disease accompanies or follows the attack and becomes part of the certified cause of death. The sudden onset of any complaint attended by chest symptoms and accompanied by a high temperature, should cause the patient to stay in bed and receive prompt medical attention. Although the deaths from Enteric Fever during the year only number 15 as against 9 in the year 1898, the number of cases of the disease increased threefold. As usual, it was in the Autumn months when the Fever cases were most numerous. With the exception of several instances where more than one case occurred in the same house, the cases were sprinkled fairly equally throughout the District. The whole of the East of London participated in this increase of the disease. I have sought in vain for some probable cause of the outbreak. I am happy to report that with the close of the year the number of notifications became satisfactorily reduced. At the close of last summer the Chairman of the Public Health Committee together with your Clerk and myself had a conference with a Medical Inspector of the Local Government Board on the subject of Bubonic Plague. It was known at Oporto that an outbreak of the disease had taken place. English ports were in some danger of receiving persons who might be suffering from the plague, or be in the incubative stage of the disease. Suggestions were made by the Inspector which conveyed the desire of the Local Government Board upon the subject. Your Board readily consented to adopt the Inspector's suggestion, and it was very soon arranged that any person coming from an infected port should be placed under the observation of a medical man. Two gentlemen consented to act in case of necessity, but fortunately their services have not been required. Cognate to the question of infectious diseases is the method of collecting and returning infected articles which require stoveing. A wire cage upon rollers is placed upon a trolley with spider wheels; the infected articles are placed in the cage, which is covered with sail canvas. At the oven door the cage is rolled off the trolley into the machine. When disinfection is complete the cage is pulled out from the other end of the machine on to the trolley and wheeled to its destination. Tho articles are not thus disturbed at the yard. 9 CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS TAKEN FROM THE RETURNS OF THE METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS' BOARD HOSPITALS, AND THE LONDON FEVER HOSPITAL.

PUBLIC MORTUARY STATISTICS. During the year 1899 a total of 195 bodies (114 males and 81 females) were deposited in the Public Mortuary, either for inquest purposes, or to await interment. For the latter purpose the institution received 12 bodies. There were 31 post-mortem examinations made. Shrouds had to be provided to the number of 50. The Fees paid by the Coroner on behalf of the London County Council amounted to the sum of £28 10s. 0d. The arrangement which was proposed last year for a Rental to be paid in substitution of a Fee per inquest has been in abeyance because it was possible at one time that the Mortuary might be required for other purposes, In a recent communication to your Board the London County Council state that after the District becomes merged into the new Municipality all inquests will be held at Poplar. I am very strongly of opinion that such a proposal will be unworkable in practice for very obvious reasons. 11 Of the total admissions into the Mortuary 19 were cases of suffocation caused through the carelessness of parents, and 15 of the subjects were either still-born or were prematurely born. Forty-one of the cases referred to non-residents. Zymotic diseases were responsible for 8 of the deaths; 41 were due to different forms of violence, generally accident; diseases of the brain and chest caused most of the remaining deaths.

In all 6,047 persons were treated by the Medical Superintendent of the Infirmary during the year. Probably the following particulars of the new Sale of Food and Drags Act, 1899, will be found useful. Sale of Food and Drugs' Act, 1899.—The Board of Agriculture is responsible for this important addition to the Statute Book. It came into operation on the 1st January, 1900. The several circulars which have been issued by the Board of Agriculture draw the attention of Local Authorities to the more important of its provisions. Under Section 2 (1) of the new Act the Board of Agriculture may procure for analysis samples of any article of food, and thereupon the powers and provisions of the Acts, with respect to the procuring of samples will be applicable, subject to certain modifications. The Act provides (Section 26) that, for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, the expression " food " shall include every article used for food or drink by man, other than drugs or water, and any article which ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or preparation of human food; and shall also include flavouring matter and condiments. One part of any sample procured by an officer of the Board is in accordance with Section 14 of the Sale of Food and Drugs' Act, 1875, as amended by Section 13 of the New Act, to be submitted by him for analysis to the public analyist; but the fee for the analysis is payable to the analyist by the local authority of the place where the sample is procured. The Act (Section 2 (2) provides that the Board are to communicate the result of the analysis of any such sample to the local authority, and that thereupon there shall be the like duty and power on the part of the local authority to cause proceedings to be taken, as if the local authority had caused the analysis to be made. It is further enacted [Section 3 (2)] that if the Board, after a communication with a local authority, are of opinion that the local authority have failed to execute or enforce any of the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, in relation to any article of food, and that their failure affects the general interests of agriculture in the United Kingdom, the Board may, by order, empower one of their officers to execute and enforce those provisions, or to procure the execution and enforcement thereof, in relation to any article of food mentioned in the order. The expenses incurred by the Board or their officer under any such order are to be treated as expenses incurred by the local authority in the execution of the said Acts, and are to be paid by the local authority in the execution of the said Acts, and are to be paid by the local authority to the Board on demand, or in default the Board may recover the amount of the expenses with costs from the local authority [Section 3 (3)]. By Section 5 of the new Act, the provisions of the Margarine Act, 1887, as amended by the new Act, are extended to "margarine-cheese," which expression is defined by Section 25 of the Act, as meaning " any substance, whether com"pound or otherwise, which is prepared in imitation of cheese, and which "contains fat not derived from milk." The effect of Section 5 is that no such substance can be lawfully dealt in, exposed for sale, or sold, except under the name of "margarine-cheese," and under the conditions set forth in Section 6 of the Margarine Act, 1887, with respect to margarine, mutatis mutandis; and the section further requires that all margarine-cheese sold or dealt in otherwise than by retail, shall either be enclosed in packages marked in accordance with the Margarine Act, 1887, (as amended by Section 6 of the new Act) or shall be itself conspicuously branded with the words, " margarine-cheese." By Section 6 of the new Act, the brand or mark required under the Margarine Act, 1887, or the new Act, to be placed on any package containing margarine or margarine-cheese must be on the packet itself, and not solely on a label, ticket, or other thing attached thereto. The same section also amends the provisions of Section 6 of the Margarine Act, 1887, so as in effect to require that every person selling margarine or margarinecheese by retail, save in a package marked as aforesaid, shall in every case deliver the same to the purchaser " in" a paper wrapper (the words " or with" in 15 Section 6 of the Margarine Act, 1887, having been repealed); it also requires that the words "margarine" or "margarine-cheese," as the case may be, shall be printed on the wrapper in capital block letters not less than half-an-inch long, and distinctly legible, and that no other printed matter shall appear on the wrapper. Section 7 of the new Act requires every occupier of a manufactory of margarine or margarine-cheese, and every wholesale dealer in such substances, to keep a register of consignments sent out therefrom, and empowers officers of the Board to inspect the register, and to enter manufacturers of margarine and margarinecheese, and inspect the process of manufacture, and take samples for analysis. It also extends the provisions of Section 9 of the Margarine Act of 1887, relating to registration of manufactories of margarine to any premises wherein the business of a wholesale dealer in margarine or margarine-cheese is carried on, and the registration of a manufactory or other premises must be forthwith notified by the local authority to the Board. Section 8 of the Act provides that it shall be unlawful to manufacture, sell, expose for sale, or import, any margarine, the fat of which contains more than ten per cent. of butter fat; that every person who manufactures, sells, exposes for sale, or imports any margarine which contains more than that percentage, shall be guilty of an offence under the Margarine Act, 1887, and that any defence which would be a defence under section 7 of that Act, shall be a defence under section 8 of the new Act, and the provisions of the former section shall apply accordingly. Section 8, however, is not to apply to any margarine manufactured or imported in fulfilment of any contract made before the '20th day of July, 1899. Section 9 of the new Act requires every person who, himself or by his servant, in any highway or place of public resort, sells milk or cream from a vehicle, or from a can or other recepticle, to have his name and address conspicuously inscribed on the vehicle or receptacle under a penalty not exceeding two pounds. By Section 11 of the new Act all Condensed, Separated, or Skimmed Milk must be so labelled in words clearly visible to the purchaser. The fine for infringing this provision is a sum not exceeding ten pounds. By section 12 of the new Act, it is provided that with regard to notice of mixtures, that the label referred to in section 8 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, shall not be deemed to be distinctly and legibly written or printed within the meaning of that section, unless it is so written and printed that the notice of mixture given by the label is not obscured by other matter on the label; but this provision does not apply to the use of any registered trade mark, or of any label which has been continuously in use for at least seven years before the commencement of the new Act. Section 18 of the new Act empowers the vendor of any article which is in an unopened tin or packet duly labelled, to decline to sell less than the whole tin or packet. The arrangements for dividing any article purchased for analysis have been modified: it is compulsory for the purchaser to divide the article into three parts as heretofore, but he need only hand one of them to the vendor upon demand. Several other provisions are enacted, chiefly referring to the official collection of samples for analysis, and then follows certain new matter concerning penalties. This portion of the new Act cannot be too widely known: it should be published by the press, or better still, it should be printed and circulated throughout the District. Section 17.—(1) "Where under any provision of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, a person guilty of an offence is liable to a fine which may extend to twenty pounds as a maximum, he shall be liable for a second offence under the same provision to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, and for any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds." (2) "Where, under any provision of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, a person guilty of an offence is liable to a fine exceeding fifty pounds, and the offence in the opinion of the court, was committed by the personal Act, default, or palpable negligence of the person accused, that person shall be liable (if the court is of opinion that a fine will not meet the circumstances of the case) to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a period not exceeding three months. 16 The last circular that was issued by the Board of Agriculture, urges local authorities to consider whether their staff is sufficient, so that the duties under the new Act may be properly carried out. It further informs local authorities that the Board will acquaint them with the details of any instances of adulteration which may be reported by the Customs, so that proceedings may be promptly taken, if necessary, by the local authority of the district to which the adulterated goods are ultimately consigned, and in which it may be presumed that they will be offered for sale. The circular concludes by stating that the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury have sanctioned the appointment of additional inspectors, who will be happy, if so desired, to confer with local authorities, as to the manner in which the law may be most efficiently enforced. For several years past, a dearth of water has been experienced in the East of London; more especially has the lack of this absolute necessity been apparent in the top floors of our Block Dwellings. It is gratifying to report, that last summer, a sufficient supply was given to us throughout, From the monthly returns of the Government Analysts, I am able to state, that the water was at all times good in quality. As I am drafting these lines, I have been made aware of the fact that the report of the Royal Commission on the question of the London Water Supply has been issued. . The Commissioners express the opinion that the water supply of the Metropolis should be under the control of a single authority, but do not consider that the London County Council is a suitable body, and, therefore, recommend that a Central Water Board should be constituted, with powers to acquire the undertakings of the companies. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH LOANE. Addendum.—After this Report was in the printer's hands I received particulars of a decision by the Lord Chief Justice and Justices Bigham and Darling in the case of Logsdon v. Booth. Up to now it had been held that Salvation Army Shelters were not Common Lodging Houses liable to be Registered under the Acts. This has now been reversed. In the course of an elaborate judgment in the Divisional Court on the 21st December last, the Lord Chief Justice said : "We know of no better description of a common lodging house than that given by the then Law Officers, Sir Alexander Cockburn and Sir W. Page Wood, to the effect that a common lodging-house was that class of lodging-house in which persons of the poorer class are received for short periods, and although strangers to one another, are allowed to inhabit one common room." If this be the proper description of a common lodginghouse, as we think it is, we cannot see in what material respect it differs from the Respondent's shelter. We arrive therefore, without hesitation, to the conclusion that such shelter is a common lodging house within the Act of 1853. It follows, that we think that Booth v. Ferrett was wrongly decided and that the Magistrate's decision now given was wrong in point of law. 17 Memorandum concerning the following Report and Tables: The Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875, resulted in your Medical Officer, Mr. Liddle, representing certain property under the Act in 1877. In the same year Sir Richard A. Cross (the Home Secretary) issued a Provisional Order—and the schemes for the demolition of the condemned areas were proceeded with. In 1881, re-building upon one of the Sites took place, viz. :—Upon the Glasshouse Street area. I have, therefore, in the following lists included this area, and afterwards all other property of any significance which has to any extent affected the housing of the working classes. The Tables, therefore, which accompanied my Report, a copy of which was sent to the London County Council, have been considerably enlarged. Report by the Medical Officer of Health for the Whitechapel District Board, of Works—prepared by Instruction of the Board—and presented to the Board on the 18th December, 1899. Subject:—Information requested for the Parliamentary Committee of the London County Council as to "accommodation provided for re-housing persons of the Labouring Class who are displaced by the Works of Railway and other undertakings" in the Whitechapel District. The information asked for is requested to be arranged in Tabular form and to comprise the last ten years operations of the description mentioned. The Clerk of the Council on the 15th November, 1899, wrote to the Board for the information. I have had as much of the required particulars prepared as will be covered by the period mentioned above. Generally it may be stated that commercial enterprise has been the motive power which has produced new buildings for old—or buildings where none previously existed. Railway Improvements have not seriously affected the Whitechapel District from the point of view now under consideration. It were well to mention, however, that within the past 20 years over 3,000 persons were disturbed when the London and Tilbury Railway Company constructed their warehouses, &c., within the Whitechapel District. No provision was specially made to re-house these people. Upon Page 1 of the Tabular Return will be found the chief items relating to house construction by a Railway Company. For re-housing persons to correspond with those displaced when the Great Eastern Railway Company pulled down houses in and around Bishopsgate Street, the Company erected three Blocks of Buildings within the District of Whitechapel which, together, accommodate 1,200 persons. This accommodation was provided for by the acquisition of vacant land entirely. On the other hand 84 persons have been disturbed by the London and North Western Railway Company without being provided for. It is only right to explain that the Company pulled the 10 houses down in compliance with Sanitary Notices served upon them by direction of the Board. 18 When I have alluded to Brady Street Mansions I think I have finished with Railway operations of any importance. Eighty apartments were in course of erection by a private owner when the property was acquired by the Great Eastern Railway Company, together with ground adjoining upon which three times the number of rooms will be placed. Probably persons from a neighbouring District will reside in these buildings—at any rate, no persons were dislodged to afford this new accommodation. At the present time in Mansell Street the London and NorthWestern Railway Company are erecting Warehouses upon a site which previously housed 300 persons. These people have had to seek shelter where they could. Various Blocks of Model Dwellings have been erected upon land which, although vacant for some years, had originally houses upon it in such a condition as to cause the Metropolitan Board of Works to invoke Cross' Act to clear it. I allude to Flower and Dean Street, Thrawl Street, &c. Then, again, some houseB have been purchased for Commercial purposes, and Warehouses already take the place of Dwellings—such as the Wool Warehouses and Messrs. Kinloch's Warehouse in Back Church Lane. Again, over 300 persons have vacated in the past few months houses which were in Courts in Back Church Lane ; here, vacant ground remains which probably will soon have Warehouses erected upon it. About 800 persons who occupied the 120 houses in the Bell Lane area have become scattered—although probably in a few months provision will be made to re-house as many, or perhaps more. In this work of improvement the London County Council have assisted. On the whole it is clear that more accommodation now exists for the working classes in the Whitechapel District than was the case before these changes took place. 19 BOARD OF WORKS—WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT.

To Dr. Joseph Loane, Medical Officer of Health. Sir, According to our usual custom we hand you herewith a Tabulated Statement, setting out the work carried out by us during the past year. It will be seen that a large amount of work has again been accomplished. The space which it would require to do so, alone prevents us giving details of the work. House to house inspection has been systematically carried out during the year. Great care and attention was paid to the question of unwholesome Food. At the foot of the Statement above referred to will be found particulars of the Articles seized and destroyed. Twenty-seven summonses were issued under the Public Health (London) Act during the year—an increase of nine as compared with last year. The Fines and Costs recovered amounted in all to £47 7s. A detailed Statement of these summonses we also hand you herewith. Last year we reported that 656 cases of Infectious Disease had occurred. We have this year to report an increase of 52 cases, making a total of 708. Disinfection was promptly carried out in every instance. We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants, RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, THOS.
