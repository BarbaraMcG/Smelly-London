A new Urinal, with two compartments, has been constructed next the "Ship" Public-house, Three Colt Street, Limehouse. The Urinal lately at the corner of York Road, Ratcliff, has been removed, and a slate urinal with four compartments, lighted with a Lamp, has been erected at the South east corner of York Street East. The Urinals are flushed and cleansed with water by men employed by the Board, and have been maintained in good order. CLEANSING & WATERING. The principal paved streets are cleansed daily, and the others not less than twice a week. During the past season the whole of the streets have been constantly watered by the Contractors with water from the East London Water Works. With reference to the performance of the duties of the Inspector for No. 2 District, vacant by the resignation of Inspector Burgin, a scheme was proposed by me and adopted by the Board as follows, viz.:— The Inspectors for Nos. 1 and 3 Districts have been relieved from the duty of superintending the cleansing and watering of their Districts, and they have been appointed for sanitary and street purposes Inspectors of 2 Districts—No. 1 including Limehouse and that part of Ratcliff North of the Commercial Road, and No. 2 District comprising that part of Ratcliff South of the Commercial Road, and Shad well and Wapping; and an Inspector has been appointed for the whole of the District (except the Commercial and East and West India Roads) to superintend the cleansing and watering. The sweepers have been divided into gangs for the whole of the District, irrespective of parishes, with a ganger to each gang. The alterations thus made have hitherto worked satisfactorily. WATER TROUGHS. The question of the necessity for Water Troughs in the Commercial Road was considered, and the Board being of opinion that it would be desirable to erect two Cattle Troughs at the East and West ends of the Urinal at the junction of the East and West India Dock Roads, arrangements were made with the Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association to put up two troughs, upon condition that the Board pay to the Association towards the cost the sum of £50, and also upon condition that the design be first approved by the Board, and arrangements made for keeping the troughs fit for use. The troughs have been erected accordingly, and the sum of £50 has been paid to the Association for the granite, pursuant to the arrangement. The cost of the water, management, repairs, &c., is defrayed by the Association. RE-NAMING STREETS & RE-NUMBERING HOUSES THEREIN. The Metropolitan Board of Works have made orders for renaming certain streets in the District, and for re-numbering the houses therein, viz.:— John Street, Limehouse, to be re-named " Endive Street." Risbie's Rope Walk, „ „ "Northey Street." Mary Street, „ „ "Dora Street.' Francis Street, „ „ "Farrance Street." Frederick Street, ,, „ "Galt Street." Spread Eagle Street, ,, ,, "Gill Street." West Street, „ „ "Lance Street." East Row, „ „ "Chusan Place." East Church Row, „ „ "Amoy Place." Arthur St., Burdett Rd., „ " Pixley Street." Cotton Street, „ „ " Locksley Street." Catherine St., Limehouse Fields „ " Maroon Street. William Street, York Square, "Raby street." Ratcliff, and the houses in all such streets to be re-numbered. Parnham Street, Dod Street, Jamaica Place, Island Row, Salmon Place, King John's Court, to be re-numbered. Fore Street and Narrow Street to be incorporated under the latter name. Railway Buildings, Limehouse, to be re-named Stocks Place. Spring Garden Place and Bere Street, Ratcliff, to be re-numbered. Bath Street, Ratcliff, to be re-named " Thirza Street." William Street, „ „ "Ronald Street." Queen Street, „ „ "Medland Street." Sun Tavern Gap, Shadwell „ "Glamis Road." Orders have been served upon the occupiers of the houses in the said thoroughfares to alter their numbers, and where streets have been re-named new name plates have been put up. IMPROVEMENTS. The widening of part of the west Footway of Birchfield Terrace.—Pursuant to the instructions of the Board, negociations were entered into with the Owners of the two small pieces of ground required to effect this Improvement, as to the price they would respectively require for the same; ultimately it was agreed to pay them £10 each, on condition that the Board made the necessary alterations in the iron railings. Arrangements for carrying out the Improvement are being made. Proposed Improvement in Ben Jonson Road.—A communication having been addressed to the Board by the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town, requesting the cooperation of this Board in a joint application to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for the opening up and improvement of Ben Jonson Road, partly in Mile End Old Town, and partly in this District, as a Metropolitan Improvement, a Meeting was arranged and took place between Deputations appointed by the Vestry and the Board, after which the Board resolved to co-operate with the Vestry in memorializing the Metropolitan Board to widen the west end of Ben Jonson Road, as a Metropolitan Improvement. "White Horse Street Improvement.—This Improvement has been completed, and the sum of £300 (the purchase money) has been paid for the Land, and .£150 the agreed contribution of the Metropolitan Board, towards the Improvement, has been received from that Board. Wapping (Between Wapping Dock Street, and Sir William Warren Square).—The sum of £1,900—the agreed contribution of the Metropolitan Board, towards the Improvement, has been written off the Loan of £3,800 made by the Metropolitan Board, to this Board. Land adjoining Wapping Workhouse.—As negociations were taking place for the sale of Wapping Workhouse, it appeared desirable to the Board that certain pieces of Land adjoining the "Workhouse should be purchased by the Board, for the widening of part of Upper Well Alley, &c., before the Workhouse property was sold. The Board resolved to purchase such pieces of Land^at a sum not to exceed £100; and in the event of the purchase being completed, that arrangements be made for severing the said pieces of Land from the other part of the Workhouse property, and for enclosing the same. BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. London and Blackwall Railway. Loop Line at Limehouse.—A Bill has been promoted in Parliament to authorize the construction of a branch Railway at Limehouse, and to make certain alterations in the London and Blackwall Railway. A Petition has been presented on behalf of the Board, with a view to the insertion of such clauses as are necessary for the protection of the interests of the District. Regent's Canal and Dock Company.—A Bill has been promoted in Parliament by the Regent's Canal and Dock Company, for abandoning their Act of 1875, and an agreement signed by two of the Directors of the Company having been entered into with the Board, providing amongst other things for the payment by the Company of the costs and expenses incurred by the Board in opposing the Bill, but the Company having neglected to pay the costs, a Petition was ordered by the Board to be presented against the Bill, with the view to procure payment of such costs and expenses incurred by the Board in opposing the Bill of 1875. Thames Subway.—A Bill has been promoted in Parliament to authorize the construction of a Subway for foot passengers, between Thames Place, Poplar, and Rotherhithe, and as such proposed Subway (although not within the Limehouse District) would be of great public utility, and beneficial to the interests of the District, the Board ordered a Petition to be presented in favor of such Bill, and that if necessary, evidence be given before the Committee. Metropolitan Board.—Metropolis Management Acts' Amendment Bill.—A Bill has been promoted by the Metropolitan Board of Works, to amend the Metropolis Management Act 1855, and the Acts' amending the same, so far as relates to the protection of the Metropolis from floods, inundations, &c., caused by the overflow of the Thames, and for other purposes. As the provisions of the Bill affect the Limehouse District very seriously, the matter has been referred to the Works and Survey Committee for consideration and report. THAMES RIVER (PREVENTION OF FLOODS) BILL. Several meetings of Delegates from the Vestries and District Boards of St. Saviour's, Fulham, Lambeth, Rotherhithe, St. Olive's, Wandsworth, and this Board, were held at the St. Saviour's District Board Offices, for the purpose of considering and discussing the provisions of the proposed measure, and the following resolutions were passed:— 1. That in the opinion of this conference the Riverside Vestries and District Boards should inform the Metropolitan Board of Works that they object to that Board obtaining powers from Parliament for compelling the Local Authorities to construct and maintain all such works as that Board may think necessary to prevent the waters of the River Thames from flooding over the walls and defences abutting thereon, and also to that Board being empowered to compel the Local Authorities, in default, to pay the costs incurred in carrying out such works. 2. That the Metropolitan Board be requested to furnish the Riverside Vestries and District Boards of Works with a copy of the proposed Bill before submitting the same to Parliament. 3. That a copy of the foregoing Resolutions be forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works. A conference was also held at the Lambeth Vestry Hall upon the subject, when a Resolution was passed (in which the Representatives of this Board took no part), expressive of opinion that the Bill should be opposed on the ground that it would be unjust to the Riverside parishes, and that the costs to be incurred should be made a charge upon the whole of the Metropolis. It was ultimately resolved by this Board to present a petition against the Bill, in order that the Board might be in a position to give evidence in opposition to its provisions; and a petition has accordingly been presented against such Bill, with a view to the protection of the interests of the District. HIGH TIDES. With regard to the question of raising Union Stairs, I, with Mr. Nathan, the Chairman of the Board, had an interview with Sir J. Bazalgette, who stated that the Metropolitau Board could not undertake the liability of preventing the flooding of any public place under the jurisdiction of the Local Authorities. Pursuant to the instructions of the Board, I made temporary arrangements for preventing the tide flowing over the Stairs, by having a gate fixed across the passage, which is shut on every occasion of high tide. By Order of the Board, a letter was addressed to the Metropolitan Board, suggesting that that Board should purchase the house over Union Stairs, to enable the passage way to those Stairs to be raised and widened, so as to keep out the water from the Thames ; and a reply has been received from the Metropolitan Board stating that the Vestries and District Boards being liable under the Metropolis Local Management Act for the raising and management of all public Docks and Stairs, and that many of such bodies (including the Limehouse District Board) having already executed such works, that Board saw no reason why an objection should be made to the general rule in the case referred to. PROPOSED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THAMES. A Letter having been received from the Whitechapel District Board of Works, with reference to the question of obtaining an efficient mode of communication between the North and South sides of the River Thames, at some point below London Bridge, inviting the aid and co-operation of this Board with a view to urging upon the Metropolitan Board the consideration of the subject, a Committee has been appointed by this Board to confer with Committees appointed by the Whitechapel District Board and the Vestry of St. George's-in-the-East upon the subject. NEW BRIDGE & PLATFORMS AT STEPNEY STATION. The works in connection with the construction of the new Bridge across the Commercial Road, and the new Platforms across York Street East and York Road have been completed, except in minor matters, and the Station opened for general traffic. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. BOARD OF WORKS LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH for the year 1876 to the BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Report on the Sanitary condition of your District during the year 1876. In that period there were registered in the District 2,197 Births and 1,266 Deaths. From this number of Deaths there must be deducted 28—the number of deaths of non-residents in the District, which occurred in the East London Hospital for Children— and to the remainder (1,230) must be added 204, the number of deaths of residents in the District which occurred in Institutions outside it. We therefore obtain a total of 1,434 deaths as representing the mortality in the Limehouse District during the year. The following Table shows the population, the number of inhabited houses, and the number of births, deaths, and marriages 2 in the District in the year 1876, and ten years preceding:— Population estimated at the middle of the year 1876, No. of Inhabited Houses in Parish or District. Births. Deaths. Marriages. 58,700 7,820 2,202 1,434 522 1875 7,820 2,167 1,518 593 1874 7,816 2,082 1,361 624 1873 7,816 2,070 1,483 606 1872 7,816 2,048 1,096 608 1871 7,816 2,082 1,227 579 1870 7,462 1,980 1,236 578 1869 7,462 1,938 1,513 526 1868 7,462 2,055 1,335 554 1867 7,462 2,029 1,176 657 1866 7,462 2,037 1,852 722 Average of 10 yrs. 1866—75 7,639 2,048 1,379 604 NOTES. 1. Population at Census 1871, 57,690. 2. Area in Acres, 576. 3. Average No. of persons in each house at Census 1871, 7.5. From a perusal of this Table it will be seen that the births and deaths were above, and the marriages below the average of the preceding ten years. Of the deaths 655 occurred in Limehouse, 363 in Ratcliff, 212 in Shadwell and Wapping, 188 in the Stepney Sick Asylum, 9 in the Smallpox Hospital, and 7 in the Fever Hospitals. Estimating the population of the Parish of Limehouse at about 31,000, that of the Hamlet of Ratcliff at 16,130, and that of the parishes of Shadwell and Wapping at 11,640, and distributing the deaths that occurred in Institutions outside the District among the parishes according to their population, we obtain a death-rate in Limehouse of 24.3 per 1,000; in Ratcliff one of 26 per 1,000; and in Shadwell and Wapping one of 21.5 per 1,000. By referring to 3 the tables of mortality in the Appendix, it will be seen that the deaths from Zymotic diseases in Limehouse were at the rate of 4.2 per 1,000; in Ratcliff at the rate of 4.7 per 1,000; and in Shad well and Wapping at the rate of 4.3 per 1,000 population per annum. It will be found that Constitutional diseases caused a mortality in Limehouse and Ratcliff equal to 3.6 per 1000, and in Shadwell a death-rate of 2.4 per 1,000. In Limehouse the death-rate from Local diseases was 10 per 1,000; in Ratcliff it was 11.2 per 1,000; and in Shadwell and Wapping it was 7.2 per 1,000. From Diseases of Development the mortality in Limehouse was 2.4; in Ratcliff 1.8; and in Shadwell and Wapping 1.6 per 1,000. I wish, however, to draw your particular attention to the infant mortality of the different parishes composing your District. You will find, on referring to the Tables in the Appendix, that the deaths of children under five years of age in Limehouse give a rate of mortality equal to 10 per 1,000, in Ratcliff a rate equal to 13 per 1,000, and in Shadwell and Wapping a rate of 9 per 1,000. From the foregoing statements it will be seen that from whatever point of view we look at the matter, either in relation to the deaths from Zymotic, Constitutional, or Local diseases, or in connection with the infant mortality, or taken as a whole, Ratcliff presents the highest deathrate. For an explanation of this fact, I think it sufficient to draw your attention to the condition of the houses in a portion of the Hamlet. In a section bounded on the North by Brook Street, on the South by Broad Street, on the East by Butcher Row, and on the West by Collingwood Street, there exists a nest of courts and alleys tenanted by the poorest of the poor. The houses in this area are for the most part in a ruinous condition; the ventilation 4 of them is totally inadequate to the requirements of their numerous inhabitants; the necessary offices are of a most primitive and meagre description; and in short I am of opinion that it would be difficult to find in the whole Metropolis a worse property than there exists. The area is inhabited by about 800 persons, and the death-rate among these people is about 36 per 1,000. I have no hesitation in saying that the existence of this area is one of the causes of the high death-rate in the Hamlet. Things are so bad there that I was induced to make a report concerning it to the Metropolitan Board of Works, under the provisions of the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Act, 1872; and I am sanguine of success in my endeavour to bring about a more sanitary condition of affairs. The following Table shows the Annual Birth Hate, Bate of Mortality, Death Rates among Children, and Deaths in Public Institutions during the past year and seven years preceding:— Birth Rate per 1,000 of the population. Annual Rate of Mortality, per 1,000 living. Deaths of Children under 1 year ; per centage of Total Deaths. Per centage of deaths of Children under 1 year to Registered Births. Deaths of Children under 5 years ; per centage of Total Deaths. Total Number of Deaths in Public Institutions. 1876 37 24.5 29 17 53 250 1869 32 25 28 22 57 190 1870 35 21 28 17 50 190 1871 34 21 26 l6 48 190 1872 35 19 29 15 52 190 1873 36 23 27 19 50 200 1874 36 21 25 16 46 176 1875 37 25.8 28 19 47 204 Average of 7 years. 1869—1875 35 22 27 18 50 191 5 From an examination of this Table it will be apparent that the birth-rate for the year was above the average of the preceding years; that the death-rate, though above the average, was below the rate for the preceding year; and that the death-rate among children was higher than the average and than the corresponding rate of last year. The following Table, exhibiting as it does the mortality from certain classes of disease, and proportions to population, and to 1,000 deaths, will assist us in coming to a conclusion as regards the mortality among children:— Total Deaths. Deaths per 1,000 of Population. Proportion of Deaths to 1,000 Deaths. 1. Seven Principal Zymotic Diseases 198 3.4 156 2. Pulmonary Diseases (other than Phthisis.) 294 5.0 232 3. Tubercular Diseases 175 3.0 138 4. Wasting Diseases of Infants . 125 2.1 99 5. Convulsive Diseases of Infants 128 2.1 101 NOTES. I. Includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea. 3. Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. 4. Includes Marasmus, Atrophy, Debility, want of Breast Milk, and Premature Birth. 5. Includes Hydrocephalus, Infantile Meningitis, Convulsions, and Teething. From a perusal of this Table, it will be evident that though the total deaths, and consequently the deaths per 1,000 of the population, were less in the year 1876 than in the year preceding, yet the proportion of deaths to 1,000 deaths was higher than in 6 the preceding year, with the exception of the deaths from Zymotic diseases, and the Convulsive diseases of infants. In other words, the deaths from Pulmonary diseases (other than Phthisis), Tubercular diseases, and the Wasting diseases of infants, are in increased proportion per 1,000 deaths. In 1875 of every 1,000 deaths 198 were due to Pulmonary diseases (other than Phthisis), 124 to Tubercular diseases, and 81 to Wasting diseases of infants. In 1876 two hundred and thirty-two of every 1,000 deaths were due to Pulmonary diseases, 138 to Tubercular diseases, and 99 to Wasting diseases of infants. As regards the deaths from Pulmonary diseases, the same relative mortality between the deaths under 5 years and above obtains in each of the years 1875—76, so that the increase has not been in the section under 5 years more than in the section above that age. From this fact we must conclude that inflammatory affections of the lungs were more fatal to persons of all ages in the year 1876 than they were in the preceding year. The deaths from Tubercular diseases do not throw any light on the matter; but when we come to the consideration of the deaths from Wasting diseases of infants, we find an increase of 18 in the proportion of deaths to 1,000 deaths. This is a large increase, and accounts, in my opinion, to some extent for the increased infant mortality. Now by referring to the foot note, we shall find that these Wasting diseases include Marasmus, Atrophy, Debility, Want of Breast Milk, and Premature Birth; and considering the habits of a large portion of the population over which you possess sanitary jurisdiction, I must say that I am not surprised at this result. Close, ill-ventilated dwellings; insobriety and want of thrift; the 7 absence of the mother to earn her contribution to the family means; ignorance, poverty, and dirty habits, all contribute to this lamentable state of things. The following Table exhibits the number of deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases in the 7 years 18G9 to 1875, and in the year 1876:— Disease. 1869 1870 1871 1872 1873 1874 1875 Annual Average of 7 years. 1869—1875 Proportion of Deaths to 1,000 Deaths in 7 years. 1869—1875 1876 Proportion of Deaths to 1,000 Deaths in 1876.

That the deaths from Measles were slightly above, and the deaths from Scarlet Fever considerably below, the average of the last seven years. That the deaths from Diphtheria represented the average. That the deaths from Whooping Cough were considerably below the average, the deaths from Fever slightly above it, while the deaths from Diarrhoea very nearly represented the average of the last seven years. 8 Sanitary Work. Various parts of the District have required my special attention during the year, on account of defective sanitary arrangements. Among them I may mention Five Bell Alley, Timbery Place, Catherine Street, May's Row, Harris Court, Salmon's Lane, and Ratcliff Square. I have reported to your Board regarding these localities on several occasions, and proceedings have been adopted which have been productive of an improved condition of the places in question. The Limehouse Cut has been frequently inspected, with the result of convincing me that the past agitation concerning its condition has caused a more frequent and efficient cleansing of the Cut, and consequently a considerable abatement of the effluvium for which the stream was notorious. The diversion of the sewage from the Canal has of course contributed greatly to this result. The Ratcliff dead-house, both as regards site and condition, came under my consideration, and I had no hesitation in reporting to you that I considered its situation open to serious objections ; but in view of the difficulty experienced in finding a site suitable for the erection of a mortuary in the District, it was decided to take steps for the improvement of the condition of the existing deadhouse. It is a matter which will recommend itself to your consideration. About the middle of November it became apparent that the District, in common with the rest of the Metropolis, was about to suffer from an outbreak of Smallpox in an epidemic form. During the latter part of the month and December, the number of cases 9 increased rapidly, until at the end of the year no fewer than 51 cases had been reported to me. Your Sanitary staff was actively engaged in carrying out measures for the limitation of the disease, among the principal of which I may mention the urging the early removal of the infected to Hospital, and the recommending the vaccination of the unvaccinated, and the re-vaccination of all who had reached the age of puberty. Disinfectants were freely distributed, bedding, clothing, &c., were fumigated in the infected houses, and were afterwards removed in a covered hand waggon to the disinfecting chamber, there to undergo a more effective disinfection by heat. No less than 980 articles were thus dealt with. With one or two exceptions the removal of the patients to the Hospitals was effected by the Stepney Union officials. In the exceptional cases alluded to the patients were removed in the Union ambulance to the Smallpox Hospital at Highgate, all cost being defrayed by their friends. The Cowsheds and Slaughter-houses in your District were inspected prior to the day for licensing the same. The defects observed in them having been remedied, the licenses applied for were granted. For a detailed statement of the routine work performed, I beg to refer you to Table 5 in the Appendix. Adulteration of Food Act. During the year 103 samples of food and drink were examined at the Laboratory, viz., 20 of milk, 12 of bread, 3 of cocoa, 5 of 10 vinegar, 3 of flour, 3 of ground ginger, 4 of isinglass, 3 of sago, 3 of Scotch whiskey, 6 of porter, 3 of tapioca, 3 of arrowroot, 10 of mustard, 9 of butter, 5 of tea, 3 of coffee, 4 of pepper, and 4 of oatmeal. Six samples of milk, 1 sample of bread, 2 samples of vinegar, 2 of isinglass, 3 of arrowroot, 1 sample of coffee, and 1 of pepper were adulterated. The milks were adulterated with water, the bread with alum, the vinegar with sulphuric acid (over and above the quantity allowed by law, viz., 1 part sulphuric acid in 1,000 parts vinegar.) It would be better to describe the isinglasses as substitutions, since they consisted entirely of gelatine ; the same remark applies to the arrowroots, as they were composed of potato starch. The coffee was mixed with chicory, and the pepper with sand. No proceedings were taken, as the adulterated articles, I am informed by the Inspectors, were purchased under circumstances which would have rendered a conviction improbable. The remainder of the samples were genuine. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE ARTHUR ROGERS, Medical Officer of Health, and Food Analyst. Board of Works Offices, 1877. TABLE I.
