In preparing a Report of the kind which the Vestry is by statute required to make, one of the points to be considered is the object for which it is required. There can be little doubt that the object for which the Vestry is required to report, is, in the first place, to give every Ratepayer an opportunity of judging what has been done, and in the next place, to enable comparisons to be made. To facilitate the latter, the Vestry consider that they cannot do better than adhere, as far as possible, to the lines laid down in former reports. The Vestry have to chronicle two unprecedented events in the history of the Vestry. These are the visits of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the visit of Her Majesty the Queen. The Vestry finding that the Prince and Princess of Wales would visit the Hamlet in June last, to lay the foundation stone of the Queen's Hall of the People's Palace, resolved to do all in their power to provide a fitting reception. The Vestry being advised that they could not legally expend any of the moneys under their control towards the reception, formed themselves into a Committee, to act with a number of the inhabitants in collecting funds for the purpose, and the applications met with such a cordial response that the whole of the decorations were paid for out of private subscriptions, and a considerable balance was left in hand. But a few days expired after this visit before rumour went abroad that Her Majesty the Queen would in person open the Hall, the foundation stone of which has just been laid, and in March of the present year, it was officially announced that such would be the case, and that the ceremony would be in May. The Vestry thereupon adopted the same course of action as on the visit of the Prince and Princess. The Visit itself, not being in the )/ear the subject of this report, ought not, perhaps, to be dealt with, but as it is rather a matter of history than of the duties of the Vestry proper, it may be well to say that everything passed off most satisfactorily, and that the Queen met with a reception, which, for heartiness, could not have been excelled in any other part of her dominions. Visits of Royalty. 6 The funds necessary to defray the expenses were collected, and a small balance was left in hand. The Vestry are very proud to think that, notwithstanding the prevailing bad times, two appeals for money, in less than a a year, should have been so liberally responded to. The Meetings have been as under:— MEETINGS. YEARS. 1883-1. 1881-5. 1885-0. 1886-7. Veatry 22 21 22 22 Standing Committees 100 93 94 109 Special ,, 10 10 9 5 TOTAL 132 121 125 136 Deaths & Resignations. Member at the Metropolitan Board of Works. Churchwardens and Overseers The largest attendance at any Vestry Meeting was 77, the smallest 34, and the average over 48. During the year, the Rev. J. F. Kitto, the Rector of Stepney, was appointed to the living of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and ceased, therefore, to be an ex-officio Member of the Vestry. The Rev. Edwin Hoskins has been appointed in the place of Mr. Kitto. Mr. Schafer resigned his seat on the Vestry, and death removed Messrs Botterill and Carrociero. The term for which Mr. Robert Jones was appointed the representative of the Vestry at the Metropolitan Board of Works, having expired at June last, that gentleman declined to be again put in nomination, and Francis John Wood, Esq., one of the members of the Vestry, was appointed in his place. Mr. Jones explained to the Vestry that his reasons for retiring were, that the calls upon his time, if he were properly to carry out his duties, were more than he now felt he could give. Mr. Jones had served the parish in a most able manner for many years, first as a Vestry-man, and then as the Member at the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Vestry felt that some recognition of his valuable services should be given, and they unanimously voted a resolution of thanks, and ordered it to be engrossed on vellum, and framed, and presented to Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones had a practical knowledge of many of the most important subjects with which the Metropolitan Board of Works has so frequently to deal, and the Vestry feel sure that his retirement is a loss not only to the parish which he represented, but also to the Metropolis in general. At the Meeting on Easter Tuesday, Messrs. J. D. Kemp and Alfred Prvost were elected Churchwardens. Messrs. A. E. Wood, 1. Cook, Rowland Hirst, and Robert Scriven were nominated Overseers. Meetings. 7 The Parliamentary Committee again considered reports of the Clerk on more than 100 bills. Therewere a great number which affected the Hamlet ir various ways, and the Vestry took the steps with regard thereto set forth in the following list:— Session Title of Bill.

Electric Lighting Act Amendment ,, ,, Sanitary Registration of Buildings ,, ,, Vestrymen Qualification ,, ,, The Thames Tunnel (Blackwall) Bill is promoted by the Metropolitan Board of Works, ostensibly to provide the means of access between the districts North and South ofthe Tames, East of London Bridge, so long and urgently required by the inhabitants of those districts. The Vestry, however, fee bound to say that they do not believe that if the scheme be sanctioned by Parliament, it will effect the object desned, Parliamentary Thames Tunnel (Blackwall) Bill 8 Coal and Wine Dues. principally by reason of the situation of the approaches. The Vestry know that many parishes think differently, and as none of the proposed works are to be executed in this Hamlet, the Vestry did not consider they would be justified in trying to oppose it beyond making strong remonstrances. The subject of the Coal and Wine Dues will be brought into prominent notice this session, and the Vestry have resolved to support the bill for their continuance, but on the express understanding that a provision be made for the amounts henceforth to be raised to be devoted to providing a means of communication East of London Bridge. The West-end of London have received the benefit of the greater part of the dues hitherto collected, and if they were now taken off the East end would no doubt be called upon to provide the funds required for the means of communication referred to by means of direct taxation. The Vestry feel that this would be a great hardship, and as they believe that ordinary cosumers would reap no benefit whatever from the removal of the dues, they determined to petition for their continuance. Dusting & Cleansing The question of cleansing the Hamlet still presses itself into notice, but the cost is kept down as much as possible. The Surveyor's report will be found to contain more details with regard to the subject. The tenders to supply corn and fodder to the Vestry have been as follows:— Date. Tenders accepted. Clover, lst.

Shearing — — — — - 38/- Claims for Compensation. During the year the claims for compensation have only numbered 3, and in each case the Vestry denied their liability, and no further step was taken. 1 his is no doubt due to it being now well known that the Vestry will not pay upon being threatened, unless the claims upon investigation be found to be just. During the year the Highways' Committee brought up a report recommending that the following street improvements be carried out in the order named : Street Improve ments. 9 1. Harford-street, 2. Sidney-street, 3. Globe-road. They also reported that Bull-lane should be widened, but that under an old agreement between the Vestry and the Limehouse District Board of Works, the latter Board had undertaken to effect any improvement. The Vestry most carefully considered the report, and ultimately resolved to carry out the improvement of Harford-st., and also to improve the Southern End of White Horse-lane, at its junction with Bull-lane, provided that the Metropolitan Board of Wcrks would contribute a moiety of the cost. Application has been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works accordingly, but the answer has not yet been received. The Vestry has also resolved to repave the footways in Sidney-street, Charles-street, Heath-street, St. Paul's-road, Rhodeswell-road, Turner-street, Settle's-street, and to pave the roadways in Grove-road (outside tramway rails), part of Sidneyand Union-street, and to borrow the sum required for the latter. Paving Footways. Paving Roadwys. Paving Street at Expense of Owners. Tramwys. The Vestry have also resolved to pave and make up the roadway from Mile End-road, on the West side of Globe Bridge, at the expense of the owners. The notice served on the Tramway Company, referred to in the last annual report was not productive of effect until the Surveyor to the Vestry was authorized to take proceedings against the Company for penalties under the Act of 1885, for failing to maintain and keep the tramways as provided by statute. After that was done the Company proceeded with and executed the works, but there is scarcely a doubt that before long the lines will be out of order again. The unpaved portion of the footway (commonly called the Waste) in the Mile End-road has caused considerable difficulty during the year. The Vestry received communications from the police stating that the coffee stalls, which took up their position on the closing of the public houses, caused an assemblage of disorderly persons, and asking the Vestry to take steps to prevent it. The Vestry, therefore, gave notice to the various stall holders requiring them not to proceed to their avocations till after 4 o'clock in the morning. This has been in some cases obeyed, but where not the Vestry's employes have had from time to time to remove the stalls. There have also been several attempts to re-commence holding cock shies, &c., which have had likewise to be removed. This has caused considerable expense, but it is absolutely necessary to preserve this portion of the road from becoming a nuisance, and the Vestry have determined to do so at whatever cost.

Ely-terrace,} Garden-st.,} The Regent's Canal Company have sought to cast upon the Vestry the duty of putting and maintaining the boundary walls and the parapet walls of the bridges into such a condition as to prevent accidents by persons falling over. The Vestry deny all liability to do this, and maintain that that duty belongs to the company. The Canal Company have been held by the Queen's Bench Division liable for damages for an accident which arose through a person falling over the boundary wall in Canal-road, owing to its insufficient height. Mr. Finch's tender to perform the jobbing sewers' work was accepted. The sewer in Lady Lake's-grove has been demolished, and a new brick sewer put in. A very serious defect has been discovered in the sewer in Commercial-road, which the Vestry fear will cost a very considerable sum to remedy, but as the matter has not been fully considered at present, the Vestry will not make further remark. The Vestry have had under their notice, under the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings' Act, a great number of houses, and have insisted on the works necessary to render them fit for human habitation being fully carried out. In the last report reference is made to the fact that the owner of Norfolk House had appealed against the order of the Vestry under the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings' Act. The case came before the Quarter Sessions, in April, 1886, and the owner then, with the sanction of the Court, undertook to carry out works to the satisfaction of the Vestry's surveyor, and the appeal was adjourned to the next Sessions in July. In July nothing hardly had been done, and the Court ordered the appellant to pay the costs of the day, and the case was adjourned till September. On attending the Court in September, the Assistant-Judge had gone for his vacation, and the sitting Judge declined to hear the case, and it was adjourned till the October sittings. At the October sittings the Assistant-Judge was still absent, and Norfolk House. 11 sitting Judge declined to hear the case. In the meantime most of the works required by the Vestry to be done had been carried out. The case ultimately came on at the January sittings, upon the subject of who should pay the costs, which was a' very serious one for, in addition to counsel, professional witnesses other than the Vestry's staff had had to be in attendance at every sitting of the Court. In the end the Court decided in favour of the Vestry on every point, and ordered the appellant to pay all the costs. The appellant then threw every possible obstacle in the way of the taxation of the costs, which were, however, allowed against him at £154 17s. 4d. Directly after this was done the appellant called a meeting of his creditors, and it is very doubtful if his estate will pay any dividend. This is the first appeal which the Vestry has had, and it brings out many of the weak points in the Act. The Vestry have always been advised that great delays could be secured, and it will be seen that this view has been thcrougly borne out. The Vestry have continually urged the necessity of making the working of the Act more simple and expeditious, and consequently economical. With a view of getting the earliest possible information of the existance of infectious diseases in the Hamlet, the Vestry communicated with all the medical men in the Hamlet, and in the districts immediately adjoining thereto, enquiring if they would be willing, under certain conditions, and in consideration of a fee of 2/6 for each case, to notify to the Medical Officer of Health of the Vestry every case of infectious disease coming under their notice. The number of affirmative replies were sufficient in the view of the Vestry to warrant them in starting the scheme, and the Vestry hope that the knowledge thus acquired will enable the sanitary officers, at the very outset, to find out if there be anything existing in the neighbourhood likely to have caused the disease, and if so to stop it, and so prevent the spread of infection. Mr. Thomas Taylor was appointed the Medical Officer of Health to the Vestry at a salary of £15° Per annum. Mr. R. H. Harland was appointed Public Analyst for the Hamlet, to be paid by fees only, which were fixed at 10/6 for each case. The Sanitary Committee pursuant to the reference of the Vestry referred to in the last report, reported in favour of two Sub-Inspectors of Nuisances being appointed, but after great consideration, the Vestry determined to try for a time if one would not be sufficient. Mr. Charles Cox, who had been appointed to the position of temporary assistant, was appointed to the new office at a salary of 36/- per week. Mr. Leshaw is alone appointed an Inspector under the Adulteration Acts, and still acts in that capacity over the whole Notification of Infe&ious Diseases. Medical Officer of Health Public Analyst. Sub-Inspedtor of Nuisances 12 Superannuation to Dr. Corner. Conferences. The Vestry have found that considerable benefit has arisen from the interchange of views with the members of other Boards on many of the subjects which affect the metropolis, and they, therefore, have appointed delegates to attend meetings as follows:— Board convening Meeting.

Hamlet, and, in consequence the Sanitary Committee have allotted to him the North and East Wards to supervise in other respects. The Centre, West and South Wards being rather larger are placed under the supervision of Mr. Cox. The Committee to which the question of Dr. Corner's superannuation was referred, recommended to the Vestry that he should be allowed as follows:— As Medical Officer of Health £63 per annum As Public Analyst £12 „ and the recommendations were adopted. FINANCIAL. I he expense of the annual eledton of Vestrymen and Auditors in 1886 was identical with that of the previous year, viz., £250 17s. I he Vestry lias again received the parliamentary grant on account of dis-turnpiked roads (£128 15s. 6d.) The poor rate shows a considerable reduction, having been 2/4 in the £, as against 2/11 in the £ last year, and 3/1 in the previous one. 1 he Vestry's calls for General, Lighting and Sewers rates have been as follows:— piked Roads. Poor Rate General Lighting and Sewers Rates. 13 For General Rate equal to 2/4 in the £. „ Lighting „ -/3 ,, „ Sewers „ -/3 ,, The School Board precept represented a rate equal to -/10¼ in the £. The proportion of the Metropolitan Board of Works precept, payable out of the General rate equal to -/¼ ,, Making in all -/11½ ,, So that if that amount be deducted from the above-mentioned total of the General rate, it will be seen that the amount required by the Vestry itself equalled 1/4½ in the £, and with the Lighting and Sewers rate to a total of 1/10½ in the £. This is considerably above former years, as appears by the following table:— 1875 The Amount required by the Vestry for its own purposes was equal to in £ 1/8 1876 ditto ditto 1/8 1877 ditto ditto 1/8 1878 ditto ditto 1/8½ 1879 ditto ditto 1/8½ 1880 ditto ditto 1/9 1881 ditto ditto 1/8 1882 ditto ditto 1/7½ 1883 ditto ditto 1/5¼ 1884 ditto ditto 1/8 1885 ditto ditto 1/7½ 1886 ditto ditto 1/7½ 1887 ditto ditto 1/10½ It must be borne in mind, however, that the Vestry has for some two or three years kept their expenditure to the lowest possible amount in consequence of the very high poor rates. Now that the poor rate has assumed a normal condition, the Vestry are bound to proceed with the works which had been delayed. As will be seen by the statement at the foot hereof, the precept of the School Board still continues to show a considerable increase. The appended statement of the amounts of the precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works shows that there has been an increase of over £1,000, or nearly a penny rate. It having become necessary to carry out some extensive repairs to the Vestry Hall, tenders for the work were invited, and that of Mr. William Wood, of Chelmsford, for £372 was accepted. During the progress of the works several further defects became apparent, and the amount of the expenditure will no don exceed the contrat price considerably. School Board Metropolitan Board of Works. Repairs at Vestry Hall 14 Loans. Assessment Appeals. Contra&s Annual Accounts. Officers' Reports. The Vestry have not actually contracted any fresh loan during the year, although they have agreed to do so, as before stated. The Vestry regret to say that they have been called upon to pay about 1,500 for costs incurred by the Assessment Committee, in relation to the appeals referred to in the previous report. Although the sum is large, it is calculated that the rates on increase in the assessment, over that on which the appellants were prepared to pay, will be about double the amount of the costs, so that, in the end, the parish will be large gainers in addition to having secured a rating, which it is not very probable the appellants will try to alter for some time to come. The case of the East London Railway has not yet been completed. A list of the contracts entered into during the year will be found at the end of the accounts The annual accounts were duly audited, found correct, and allowed by the Auditors, and are printed and published with this report.

ANNUAL REPORT upon the PUBLIC HEALTH and SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1886-7, by THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: Printed by Penny and Hull, Leman Street, Whitechatel, I. 1887. REPORT To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, I beg to hand you the Thirty-first Annual Report for the year ending March, 1887. VITAL STATISTICS. THE POPULATION OF MILE END OLD TOWN. The estimated population of Mile End Old Town is 112,000 people. This estimate is formed on the assumption that the rate of increase of the population was the same as during the decade 1871 to 1881, and in the absence of a more frequent census the plan enumerated seems to be the best. THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. The number of births registered during the past twelve months in the entire district was 4,028 and, estimating the population at 112,000, the number of births per 1,000 was 35.9, as compared with 35.9 in the previous year. NUMBER OF DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The number of deaths belonging to the entire district have been 2,129, giving a death-rate of 19.0 per 1,000. These statistics are after making allowance for the proper distribution of deaths in public Institutions to their various sanitary areas, so that they represent the acftual state of the deaths and death-rate as correcftly as possible. The number of deaths of Mile End parishioners which took place m public Institutions outside the districft was 294, therefore the numher of deaths that occurred inside the districft was 1,845, giving a death ratr of 16*5 per 1,000.

This class of disease as arranged by the Registrar-General's^ Returns comprises Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet-fever, Diphtheria, Whoopingcough, Typhus-fever, Enteric-fever, Simple-fever and Diarrhoea. These diseases have a great interest for Sanitarians inasmuch as they are more or less of a preventible character, and it is to an extent that we judge of the sanitary condition of the district, but, of course, there are limitations to these inferences as some years we get epidemics of these diseases whilst others we are comparatively free. There can be no doubt that we can do a great deal to modify their spread by efficient sanitation. The number of deaths that have taken place from these diseases is 376, giving a death-rate of 3.3 per 1,000. SMALL-POX. This disease has, I am happy to say, been quite foreign to the district during the past year. Only 14 cases occurred in the whole Metropolis for the four quarters ending March, 1887. 94 MEASLES. The total number of deaths registered as due to this disease is 712 Most of these occurred during a slight epidemic at the beginning of the year and were caused by the children being exposed to the severe weather too early, and as a result inflammation of the lungs supervened, which in most cases was the secondary cause of death. SCARLET-FEVER. The number of deaths from this cause was 37, giving a death rate of 0.3. This small number is to be accounted for only by the disease not appearing in an epidemic form, and also to the fact that a much larger use is made of the isolation available in the Asylum Board Hospitals. It would be much more gratifying if parents would see the necessity of isolating cases of this disease, and when isolation is impracticable to have them removed to the Fever Hospitals. Much of the prejudice that existed on the part of parents objecting to their children's removal is rapidly diminishing. There can be but little doubt of the benefit to be derived from early isolation of infectious diseases and it is very satisfactory to find the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board are wishful to enable persons suffering from these diseases to be admitted to their hospitals with as little delay as possible, and with that view, have now resolved to apply to the Local Government Board to obtain authority to remove cases of Fever and Small-pox whose removal shall be applied for by a duly registered medical practitioner. If this can be done I am sure it will save much unnecessary delay, which has been both prejudicial to the patient, distressing to the friends, and dangerous to the locality, instead of having to go through the present formalities of which you are aware. DIPHTHERIA. The number of deaths from this contagious disease registered is 15. Most of these deaths occurred in public Institutions outside the district, only 6 of these taking place in Mile End ; it is to be regretted that the Local Government Board do not authorise the reception of cases of this disease to the Asylums Board Hospitals, as it is often difficult to obtain admission to General Hospitals. ENTERIC FEVER. The number of deaths from this disease was 17. This I consider to be very small indeed. In one part of the district several cases were directly traced to defective drainage, which was rectified and happily the disease did not spread. THE NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. I here can be but little doubt that compulsory notification of these diseases is urgently required and it is to be hoped the Government will, at no distant date, deal with the subject. All the sanitary authorities of the Metropolis have expressed themselves in favour of the principle of notification, and whilst awaiting for such an important event to take place your Vestry have sanctioned a system of "voluntary notification from 95 medical men in the district" by paying them a small fee for such notification and, I am happy to say, although the system has only been working a few months, a large number of cases have been notified to us and means taken to prevent, as far as possible, its spread. I hope in the near future that medical men as a body in the district will be good enough to give us the information which is used only for purposes of disinfection, and to improve, where necessary, the sanitary surroundings, and not for removal unless at the patient's and medical attendant's wish. The following are the sources from which we derive information of infectious diseases:— The London Hospital kindly send us immediate notification of all cases who apply for admission to them. The Postal Authorities notify to us when any of their employes residing in the district are suffering from these diseases, and I send a certificate after disinfection has been carried out. The District Medical Officers to the Board of Guardians also notify to us all cases coming under their care, or in which they order removal to the Fever Hospitals. The Asylums Board report to us all cases admitted to their land or river Hospitals every week and to all the Medical Officers of Health in the Metropolis. Thus, from the various sources, we get numerous cases notified to us and as soon as possible the rooms and clothing are thoroughly disinfected. SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS. The house to house visitation has been steadily going on during the past twelve months with the result that very many sanitary improvements have been made. No less than 2,085 closets have been provided with water supply, 1,241 dust-bins provided, and 949 yards paved. These alone entail a large amount of work and the difficulties in the way of getting these works completed vary very much; in some cases owners and occupiers are both equally anxious for sanitary improvements in the dwellings and surroundings. In many other cases one part of the work will be done and the rest left undone until, by repeated writing and visiting the owners, it does get accomplished. I consider that such a large amount of work having been carried out without magisterial interference, even in a single case, speaks volumes for the owners of property and also for the tact, energy and perseverance, on the part of our Inspectors. It is greatly to be regretted that there is no legislation to enforce tenants to keep their houses in proper repair after having been made so by the landlord, as we come across numerous instances where tenants show an utter disregard for cleanliness, etc., and so we have to come on the landlords to keep the properties in a sanitary condition. There are still a large number of houses which require sanitary improvements and which will be taken in hand in due course. THE REMOVAL OF NUISANCES INJURIOUS TO HEALTH. The number of nuisances that have been removed during the past year have been very large, as will be seen from the Inspectors' report, and these it must be remembered do not represent the total number as 96 many of them other than those recorded are of such a varied character and so numerous that it is almost impossible to keep records of them. By the regular inspection of houses and streets many nuisances are found out and replaced by healthy conditions. We find that latterly these nuisances are increasing in some parts of the West Ward on account of the rapid importation of almost destitute Dutch and Polish Jews whose habits are so filthy that it will take all the energies of the Inspectors to keep their surroundings in a cleanly condition. PUBLIC URINALS. Several of our public Urinals have recently had an intermittent water supply provided to them as an experiment, and as it seems to work so well, the sooner the whole of the Urinals have a similar supply provided the better it will be for the public health. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. There are 19 Slaughter-houses which have had their licenses renewed, most of them are little used ; they have all been visited and found to be in a very cleanly condition. LICENSED COW7-HOUSES. The number of licensed Cow-houses are 45. The class of cattle and the sanitary surroundings are very satisfactory ; they have all been repeatedly visited during the year. Sanitary Inspectors' Report of Works Executed and Sanitary Improvements Effected during the Year 1886-7. Number of Houses inspected 2646 Closets provided with water supply 2085 Yards repaved or repaired 949 Traps provided to drains 480 Receptacles for dust provided 1241 New traps and pans provided to closets 40 New closets erected 19 Houses and premises connected with sewers 31 Houses disinfected in consequence of Infectious diseases having occurred therein 106 Number of articles of bedding and clothing disinfected 436 Sink pipes disconnected from soil pipes 17 Overcrowding abated 13 Houses cleansed 180 Drains cleansed and repaired 149 Accumulations of offensive matter removed 35 Swine and other animals removed from unsuitable places 12 In addition to the above works very numerous inspections of premises where offensive works are carried on have been made during the year and the necessary orders given for the abatement of nuisances. 97 In all cases coming to my knowledge I have removed and properly disinfected (with the consent of the owners) all bedding and clothing used by persons suffering from Infectious diseases. The Slaughter and Cow Houses in the Hamlet have also been frequently visited during the year. From these reports it will be seen that a great deal of work has been done in this, the Sanitary Department. There is much more to be done to improve the healthiness of the district, which will be accomplished as soon as time and circumstances will permit. In conclusion I beg to thank the Sanitary Committee and also the members of the Vestry for the courtesy they have shown me during this my first year of office, and hope I may be many years associated with you.
