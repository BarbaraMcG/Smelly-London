PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE His Worship the Mayor (Councillor Mrs. A. M. Ott, j.p.) Chairman: Councillor W. Taylor, j.p. Alderman Mrs. G. E. Green „ E. Murphy, L.C.C. „ T. F. M. Shepherd Councillor S. H. Banks „ Mrs. M. J. Chrisp Mrs. F. K. Dolby „ Miss E. E. Greenaway „ A. G. Keyse ~ R. S. Marriott „ Mrs. D. Nason Public Health Department, Deptford Town Hall, $.E.14. August, 1956. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the health and environmental circumstances of Deptford. The population continues to decline and is now estimated at 72,890 for the mid-year, but the death rate of 11.7 is a slight improvement on last year, and of course is still handicapped by the numbers of non-residents dying in the old people's wards in the New Cross General Hospital. The birth rate declined from 14.72 to 14.3 per 1,000 living but the Infantile Mortality Rate reached the lowest ever in the history of the Borough. The figure of 11.4 per 1,000 live births compares with 16.5 last year, and must be about the lowest in the country. With such small numbers involved it is erroneous to place too much reliance on statistics for one year, but considering that twenty-five years ago the figure was 53, the many agencies concerned with maternity and child care have cause to feel gratified, because although these great advances are in part a reflection of improved living standards, these services have made major contributions to this gratifying result. In common with general experience throughout the country, deaths from carcinoma of the lung and bronchus continue to increase as did diseases affecting the heart and vascular system. Deaths from Tuberculosis declined from 20 to 14; a trend due to the great advances which have been made in recent years in the treatment of the disease. There is no sign, however, that Tuberculosis is becoming less prevalent, and in fact there was an increase in primary notifications from 156 to 164. Dr. Rigby, the Chest Physician, has been good enough to send me an account of work of the Chest Clinic, together with information about his investigations in Carrington House. It is disturbing to note that 30 per cent of the cases found at the Common Lodging House were from Ireland. It seems desirable that more positive measures should be taken to ensure that only healthy individuals are allowed to enter the United Kingdom as permanent citizens for it is in the early years when they are establishing themselves that they are most likely to have to live in overcrowded and insanitary conditions, which favour the spread of a community disease like Tuberculosis among the susceptible. An account is also included of the Mass Radiography Unit which visited Deptford from 18th to 24th July, and 26th July to 2nd August. The large increase in the total of Infectious Diseases notifications is due almost entirely to the incidence of measles, of which there were 1,036 cases notified. There was a slight increase in Whooping Cough from 91 to 114, but there was little food poisoning or dysentery. It is pleasing to report the absence of Diphtheria from Deptford. During the year, following the comprehensive survey of the Borough for slum clearance purposes, a programme of allocation for the years 1956 to 1960 was agreed with the London County Council and the return submitted to the Minister for his approval. In connection with atmospheric pollution, apparatus was installed in the Public Health Department for measuring smoke and sulphur dioxide concentrations, and readings commenced in the summer. In conclusion, I am glad to record my thanks to the staff for their loyalty and service, and would also like to acknowledge the help and support of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee during the year. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical Officer of Health. STAFF Medical Officer of Health J. Kerr Brown, B.sc., m.b., ch.B., D.P.H. Public Analyst (part time) H.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0.93 and for deaths 1.02 and the birth-rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated decrease in the population is 930, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 191. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table I. The deaths are classified under 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948. Area of Borough 1,564 acres Estimated mid-year home population 72,890 1954 1955 Deptford London London Deptford Birth rate (per 1,000 living) 14.7 15.2 14.3 15.0 Still births (ditto) 0.32 0.30 0.32 0.31 Death rate (ditto) 12.0 10.7 11.7 11.4 Infantile mortality rate (deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live births) 16.5 20.7 11.4 23.3 1954 1,034 1955 Live births registered Legitimate 1,005 (adjusted for inward and outward transfers) Illegitimate 55 43 1,089 1,048 Total 23 Still births registered Legitimate 20 Illegitimate 4 1 24 24 Total 13 11 Infant deaths Legitimate Illegitimate 5 1 18 12 Total Total deaths 886 857* There was one maternal death during 1955 resulting in a maternal mortality rate of 0.95. *Of this number 111 occurred in the New Cross General Hospital. The death rate for Deptford if these deaths were excluded would be 10.2 instead of 11.7. Section " B " INFECTIOUS DISEASES General The total number of notifiable infectious diseases showed the considerable increase of 750 upon that of the previous year. On detailed examination, however, it will be found that the increase is entirely due to a severe outbreak of Measles—l,036 cases being notified as against 236 in the previous year. Indeed, it was the most severe outbreak that has occurred during the past ten years. Six cases of Poliomyelitis were notified, compared with 8 and one death in the previous year. There was, however, a slight increase in Whooping Cough, 114 cases being notified as against 91, in the previous year. Scarlet Fever notifications showed a decline from 77 last year to 39. The Borough was comparatively free from Food Poisoning and Sonne Dysentery, only 14 cases in all being notified. There was an increase in the cases of Acute Pneumonia notified —41 as against 21 in the previous year—and it is noteworthy that the majority of notifications referred to people in the upper age groups. For the fifth successive year no case of Diphtheria was notified. Infectious Diseases.

Tuberculosis All new cases in the Borough, whether or not they are transferred from other areas, are visited by the Sanitary Inspectors in order to ascertain the housing conditions and to see if any improvements can, or should, be effected. The deaths due to respiratory tuberculosis in Deptford in 1955 were 12 males and 2 females as compared with 12 and 8 respectively during the previous year. Of the deaths from respiratory tuberculosis 7 of the male deaths and both of the female deaths were of persons between the ages of 15 and 65 years, whereas of the deaths from all causes, only about 27% were within this age group.

P. V. Rigby, has kindly supplied the following extremely interesting report concerning the Chest Clinic at Harton Street, and the research which he has carried out regarding tuberculous cases in Carrington House, a large Common Lodging House in the Borough. Cases on Chest Clinic Register at 31.12.55:— Definite 1,134 Observations 58 Number of new contacts examined 348 Total attendances at the Chest Clinic 6,388 Total attendances at the Refill Clinic 1,619 TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE Interviews by Secretary 1,058 Cases assisted by Care Committee 67 Sums raised by Christmas Seal Sale (1955) £166 2s. 2d. 10 "You will also be interested to learn that no less than 1,039 new patients were seen at the Chest Clinic at the request of private doctors for an opinion on the chest condition during 1955; in 1954 the figures were 841. A relatively small proportion of these cases were, of course, found to be tuberculous, but a wide range of conditions was found in those cases in which abnormalities were discovered—these include cancer of the lung, bronchiectasis, bronchitis and other chest conditions. A great deal of individual study of cases is often required with many special tests to determine whether or not a person has, or has not got say, cancer of the lung. This condition is, of course, occupying a great deal of my attention at present. These observations may illustrate the change of trend in the work of the Chest Clinic from one where the main work was supervision of treatment of tuberculosis cases and their contacts, to a position where a large amount of diagnostic consultative work is done at the clinic. i should add that the work of supervision and treatment of a tuberculosis register of cases approximately double now what it was in 1945, is in itself no light task in the Borough of Deptford. This is owing to all the new advances in drug treatment and chest surgery for pulmonary tuberculosis these days. The number of deaths in 1955 directly attributed to pulmonary tuberculosis was 14, compared with 20 in 1954, five of which occurred in persons under the age of 45. On the other hand the number of deaths occurring in persons on the tuberculosis register in 1955 was 23, compared with 33 in 1954. This suggests that while there is still much morbidity from pulmonary tuberculosis, the effect of treatment is that the patients are ultimately dying of diseases other than tuberculosis. It may be possible to attribute this to the beneficial influence of chemotherapy and other new methods of treatment of tuberculosis. To bring this figure into perspective, you have kindly informed me that 56 persons died from cancer of the lung in 1955. (52 males and 4 females). The tuberculosis cases in Carrington House have occupied a great deal of my attention. 95 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis have been discovered in men residing there between the beginning of 1950 and the present date. An additional 50% of cases have come to my attention as inward transfers to the area making approximately 150 cases in all. I am in the course of making a detailed study of these 95 brand new cases of tuberculosis discovered in Carrington House inmates. Suffice it to say at present, that their average age is 59 years and that as far as severity of disease is concerned, eight had slight disease, seventy had disease of moderate severity and the remaining 17 had advanced tuberculosis. There have been 21 deaths among these cases to date. As would be expected in persons in a common lodging house, two-thirds of these men were single persons, of the remainder 13 were widowers, and 10 were separated from their wives or else divorced. With regard to occupation, over three-quarters of the men belonged to the labouring classes and the remainder were in semi-skilled occupations, while comparatively few, namely two, were in clerical occupations; 7 were kitchen or restaurant porters. 11 The country of origin was of interest, in that no less than 30% came from Northern or Southern Ireland, the majority from the latter. Comparatively few, two cases, came from Scotland. The great majority were Londoners or from the counties surrounding London. A large number of these cases have moved on to other areas of England since their diagnosis, as they are men with few local ties and wandering habits". Mass Miniature Radiography The Mass Miniature Radiography Unit paid visits to Deptford during the year and I attach an analysis of the results of the survey which was carried out at St. Paul's House, from 26th April to 2nd June; All Saint's Hall, Hatcham, from 18th July to 22nd July, and St. George's Hall, Brockley, from 26th July to 2nd August, 1955.

Of these cases, precisely one-quarter had been previously X-rayed by mass radiography units and seven of these within the last two years." Section "C" SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES ETC., AND FACTORIES ACT 14 SANITARY INSPECTIONS General For the first time in some years we have had a full establishment of Sanitary Inspectors and as a result it was possible for more attention to be paid to Food Premises and Shops generally. The total number of primary inspections by the District Inspectors rose from 5,681 in 1954 to 6,092. Complaints were down by 317 from 2,186 to 1,869, and this enabled the Inspectors to deal more adequately with routine matters such as those mentioned in the first paragraph. Defects found were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, the London County Council (General Powers) Act, and the London County Council Byelaws. A summary of the Sanitary work carried out in the Borough appears in Tables II and 111 of the Appendix to this Report. Smoke Abatement and Air Pollution It was not necessary to undertake legal proceedings or any action other than informal during the year. A station for measuring atmospheric pollution was set up in the Public Health Department building, and results and details are sent to the Fuel Research Station at Greenwich. Offensive Trade The one factory in the Borough at which an offensive trade is carried on received increased supervision by the District Inspector during the warm summer months. As a result of co-operation between the management and the Inspector complaints were kept to a minimum in spite of the difficult climatic conditions. Rodent Control One Rodent Supervisor and two Operators were employed throughout the year under the general direction of the Chief Sanitary Inspector, and the following tables summarise the work carried out: — 15 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1955 Type of Property Non-Agricultural (2) Dwelling Houses (including Council Houses) (1) Local Authority (3) All other (including business premises) (4) Total of Cols.

Bathing Centre Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 968 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies and impetigo 22 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 267 Scabies baths for adults 5 Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and efficient water supply were issued in respect of 40 new premises. THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 The following is an epitomised statement of the administration of the Act. The inspections, visits, etc., are carried out by the District Sanitary Inspectors. 18 Inspections Number of Number on Register Notices Written Occupiers Prosecuted Inspections (1) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities - - 56 29 (2) Factories not included in (1) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority - - 339 140 Defects Found Referred Found Remedied To H.M.

Section "D" FOOD AND DRUGS AND REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST 20 FOOD AND DRUGS A full-time Food Inspector is employed in the supervision of Food and Food Premises. Food Samples are sent for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and for bacteriological examination to County Hall. Details of the work of the Food Inspector will be found in the Appendix Tables, V, VI and VII and details from the Public Analyst's Report are included at the end of this section. Royal Victoria Yard Considerable quantities of food no longer considered fit for prolonged storage by the Admiralty, are examined in order to assess their fitness for sale to the general public. 178 Evelyn Street New food sorting premises have been opened during the year Details will be found in Appendix VI. Ice-Cream Forty-two samples were taken for bacteriological examination. Grade I 25 Grade II 10 Grade 111 4 Grade IV 1 Lollies 2 42 Labelling of Food Orders, 1946/50 All pre-packed samples of food submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were considered also under the Labelling of Food Orders, 1946 and 1950. Eighty-four separate examinations were made under these Orders and one slight infringement was dealt with by correspondence. Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941 All pre-packed drugs submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were also considered under the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. Two infringements were dealt with by correspondence with manufacturers. Food Standards Eighty samples were specially examined under the various Food Standards Orders. In one instance infringement was dealt with by informal action. 21 Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations Wherever desirable, Food and Drugs Act samples were examined for the presence of prohibited preservatives and colouring matters and for excessive amounts of the permitted preservatives. Three infringements were dealt with informally. Mineral Oil in Food Order, 1949 Ninety-three samples were taken under the Order—no contraventions were found. Fluorine in Food Order, 1947 Nine samples were taken under the Order —no contraventions were found. School Milks Twenty-one samples were sent for chemical examination and twentyone were sent for bacteriological examination. Milk (Special Designations) Act Thirty-three samples were submitted.

These samples were also examined wherever applicable under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943, the Food Standards Orders, 1944-51, the Labelling of of Food Orders, 1946-51, and the Fluorine in Food Order, 1947. All the samples were taken informally. The Public Analyst, Dr. H. Amphlett Williams, Ph.D.(Lond.), A.C.G.F.C., F.R.1.C., has submitted the following report on milk sampling:— 23 " I have pleasure in furnishing the following particulars summarising the composition of the milk samples submitted for analysis during the year 1955. " Sixty samples of milk were submitted during the year, all of which were taken informally. None were found to be " adulterated but three samples contained less than the legal minimum of 8.5 per cent of milk-solids other than milk-fat. These samples were, however, submitted during February, when the seasonal decline in quality usually becomes apparent, and as the freezing points were found to be within normal limits the milks were regarded as ' genuine '. " The average composition of all milk samples analysed is shown in the following Table, with the average of previous years for comparison. AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF MILK, DEPTFORD Period Fat Solids-not-fat Total Solids 1947 3.51 8.68 12.19 8.72 1948 3.45 12.17 1949 3.47 8.74 12.21 8.70 1950 3.44 12.14 1951 3.52 8.63 12.15 1952 3.48 8.69 12.17 1953 3.44 8.69 12.13 1954 3.45 8.72 12.17 1955 3.50 8.64 12.14 " As may be seen, the averages show very little variation since the end of the War, due no doubt to the Metropolitan supply being composed almost entirely of bulked milk". In addition to the analyses under the Food and Drugs Act, 270 other examinations under other Acts, Orders and Regulations were carried out.

Total 270 4 Section " E " HOUSING 28 HOUSING At the end of 1955 the Council had a total of 830 permanent houses, maisonettes and flats, a total of 388 temporary houses of various types and controlled a further 1,267 properties under requisition. The requisitioned properties housed 1,916 units of tenancy. During 1955, 30 flats and 4 maisonettes were completed for the Council and 110 flats and 14 maisonettes were in the course of construction. During 1955, 3,884 improvements were carried out in 1,204 houses, somewhat less than last year, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 275. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1955: — Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 2,043 Number of Statutory Notices served 446 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 1,204 Overcrowding Number of individual dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 60 Number of families found to be living in overcrowded conditions during the year 8 Number of families who have obtained alternative accommodation during the year 30 There are many underground rooms throughout the Borough and a fairly high proportion of them, although used as dwellings, do not conform in all respects with the statutory requirements and cannot without major structural alterations be made to do so. Closure is not, however, practicable in present circumstances and owners have been co-operative in making these rooms reasonably fit. Housing Repairs and Rents Act and Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts Fifty-eight applications for Certificates of Disrepair were made during the year. Forty-five were granted and the remainder were either refused or the application withdrawn. Section "F" PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES 30 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES The services which are provided by the London County Council at the various clinics are as follows :— Health Centre, Amersham Road, S.E.14.

Section " G " MISCELLANEOUS 32 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection. Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service Food samples are normally sent to the Medical Research Laboratory at County Hall, but clinical items, e.g., faeces specimens, continue to be sent to the Park Hospital Laboratories. The facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, are occasionally used by general practitioners for the examination of swabs and other specimens. Mortuary and Coroner's Court Before the war both the Boroughs of Deptford and Greenwich maintained their own mortuaries and coroner's courts. By arrangement, and following war damage, the coroner's court at Deptford and the mortuary at Greenwich have been closed. The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, greatly increased. The total number of bodies received during 1955 was 585, of which 257 were received from Greenwich and 265 from Woolwich. A fee of £1 Is. Od. per body is paid by the Greenwich and Woolwich Borough Councils in respect of these admissions. National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to 33 arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. Twelve persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1955. Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for securing the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. Several cases were removed either to hospital or County Council homes for the aged after persuasion, but it was not necessary to invoke Section 47 during the year. Services for Old People The voluntary services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five Darby and Joan Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the District. In addition, the Albany Institute Old Peoples' Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly by Deptford people. There is no provision, as yet, in Deptford for a laundry service, but I give details regarding our " Meals on Wheels " service which is carried out in co-operation with the Women's Voluntary Services Organisation. About 170 meals are provided to about 130 old people each week. The meals are obtained from the United Girls School for Social Services at a cost of Is. 6d. per meal, for which the individuals pay lOd. and the London County Council pay a subsidy of 8d. per meal (the price is now under re-consideration). The Council pay the United Girls School monthly for the cost of the meals. The Deptford Borough Council provide a vehicle (which was presented by a local fiim) and a driver, to deliver about 40 meals twice a week to house-bound old folk and the remainder of the meals to " Darby and Joan " Clubs. The W.V.S. provide the helpers for delivery of meals. Shops Act, 1950 In the course of their routine inspection the Sanitary Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of " break-point" chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. 34 Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At the baths at llderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Eight applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council and granted. Medical Examinations During the year 30 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme. Sixty-one examinations of sick employees were also made during the year and reports submitted thereon. Conferences The Council was represented at Conferences during the year as follows: Royal Sanitary Institute —Scarborough. The Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor W. Taylor, J.P.) and the Medical Officer of Health. National Smoke Abatement Society—Bournemouth. The Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor Mrs. F.K. Dolby) and Mr. G. F. Wilton, Sanitary Inspector. Sanitary Inspectors' Association—Scarborough Mr. W. F. Mayo, Chief Sanitary Inspector. Refresher Courses for Sanitary Inspectors The payment of fees for a Meat Refresher Course was authorised in the case of one Inspector.
