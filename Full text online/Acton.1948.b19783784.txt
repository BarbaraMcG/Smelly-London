General Provision of Health Services in the Area. Laboratory Facilities. The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service, Section 6, provides a Pathological Service at the King Edward Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. 11 Having this laboratory so close to Acton is a great asset, as not only can our specimens for diphtheria, tuberculosis, etc., be dealt with readily, but also samples of milk can be taken for the methylene blue test and phosphatase test. Specimens for Chemical Test are sent elsewhere. The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens submitted for examination. Type. No. of Specimens examined. Throat and Nose swabs 589 Sputum for T.B. 50 Fæces 124 Methylene Blue Reductase Tests on Milk and Ice-Cream 182 Ambulance Facilities. From January 1st until July 5th, the ambulance service was administered by the Acton Borough Council. Since July the Middlesex County Council have been responsible for this service. Nursing in the Home. , The facilities provided by Acton Hospital for visiling the homes of sick persons to carry out treatment were continued up to July 5th, and since that date this service has been aken over and administered by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care during the year was 579, necessitating 16,988 visits. Hospital Provision. Since July 5th the hospitals serving this area are under the administration of the N.W. Hospital Regional Board. Patients are still admitted to the Central Middlesex Hospital and Acton Hospital, and by use of the Emergency Bed Service, a doctor can obtain admission of a patient. This letter method is for acute cases only; the admission of chronic sick, especially the old, for hospital treatment is not so easy. 12 Since July 5th the late Public Assistance Institutions are only admitting adult persons who can help themselves, so consequently, the chronic sick not being able to help themselves are considered to need medical treatment. Since the acute cases are more urgent there is a long delay before admission takes place after a request has been made. The Hospital Administrators may fail to realise that a chronic case can become an acute case. Maternity and Child Welfare. Palmerston Road Mission Hall was opened as a Clinic for Welfare and Maternity purposes on the 8th March, 1948. There are therefore now five Centres accommodating six Health Visitors' districts. (1) The School Clinic, Avenue Road (Two Health Visitors' districts served by this Centre). (2) Steele Road Mission Hall, Acton Green. (3) John Perryn School, East Acton. (4) St. Gabriel's Church Hall, Noel Road, North West Acton. (5) Palmerston Road Hall, South Acton. As in the previous year, two weekly sessions were held for each Health Visitor's district, one with a doctor in attendance, and one without. Average weekly attendances (last year's figures in brackets):— Central district 99.1 (90.2) South East 82.3 (81.3) South West 88.8 (70.0) North East 94.2 (75.3) North West 52.3 (60.5) West district 86.1 (77.7) Attached is a Table showing the attendances at all Clinics and the visits paid by the Health Visitors to the homes.

Midwifery Service. Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. During 1948, 408 women were recommended for admission to Central Middlesex County Hospital for their confinements and the bulk of these were accepted. Four Ante-Natal clinics were held weekly at Avenue Road, and a fifth session was held at the new Palmerston Road clinic. 14 Birth Control Clinic. As in previous years, arrangements for this purpose with the North Kensington Women's Welfare Association were continued, but as from the 26th May one clinic weekly was held at, the Palmerston Road Hall, South Acton, a nominal fee being paid to the County Council for the use of the premises. 9 patients were referred for advice in 1948, and in addition 2 patients were referred to the sterility clinic. Number of new cases attending Clinics during year 918 Total number of attendances made 4275 Average number attending weekly (5 clinics) 82 The following Table gives the stage of pregnancy at which the new cases reported for examination:— 1st month 10 6th month 77 2nd month 66 7th month 54 3rd month 319 8th month 26 4th month 222 9th month 3 5th month 130 Found to be not pregnant 11 918 The arrangements made by women for their confinements are tabulated below:— % Confined in Central Middlesex County Hospital 40.7 Confined in Queen Charlotte's Hospital 17.4 Confined in other Hospitals 5.8 Confined in Nursing Homes 6.2 Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's Midwives attending) 29.3 Evacuated to Emergency Maternity Hostels - Private Doctors and Midwives .6 15 Post Natal Clinics. The majority of women had their post-natal examination at the hospital where they were confined, those confined at home being examined at Queen Charlotte's Hospital. 23 women attended our clinic for their examination. Exercises Class for Mothers. The classes for expectant mothers were again a feature of the ante-natal work, although a slight decrease was noted in the numbers attending, the total for 1948 being 105 as against 140 for 1947. The total number of attendances was 2,756 as compared with 1,149 for 1947. Home Help Scheme. At the end of the year there were 27 Full Time Domestic and Home Helps, and 6 Part Time Staff. The following Table shows the number of cases booked and those actually attended:— Maternity: Number of Cases booked 96 Number of Cases attended 75 No. of Cases cancelled 21 (Other arrangements made without notification to Town Hall). T.B. Cases attended 6 Other Cases attended 183 Day Nurseries. The routine of the Day Nurseries was maintained during 1948 along the same lines as in previous years. The same four Nurseries were in being, namely, Bollo Bridge Road, Horn Lane, Friars Place Lane and 'Longcot' the accommodation at these being as follows:— Under 2 Over 2 Total Bollo Bridge Road Horn Lane Friars Place Lane 'Longcot', Newton Grove 17 25 20 19 18 35 25 25 35 60 45 44 16 The numbers on the registers at 31st December, 1948, were as follows:— Bollo Bridge Road 36 Horn Lane 62 Friars Place Lane 47 ' Longcot' 47 The waiting list again shows an increase on the previous year's figure.

Immunisation was carried out along the lines indicated in previous reports. Advertisements were placed monthly in the local paper giving times and places of inoculation clinics, and posters were displayed in prominent places. In addition to this, the following routine was practised: (1) A notice was sent to the parent of each 6 months' old child. (2) All Infant Welfare attenders were approached. (3) All children admitted to Day Nurseries were offered protection. 17 (4) Health Visitors combed their districts for children who did not attend Welfares, and urged their protection. (5) Head Teachers gave forms of consent to new school entrants. (6) Prior to school medical inspections, questionnaires were sent to each parent asking, inter alia, whether the child had been inoculated. If the answer were in the negative a form of consent was sent to the parent. All immunised cases are followed up and, at the end of 'hree years, each child is offered a boost dose. At the age °f 11 years or over, this is preceded by a Schick test. All children under 5 who have not had the disease, are lnoculated against Whooping Cough at the same time as they are inoculated against Diphtheria, i.e., they have three doses protective material at monthly intervals. 60.3% of the population under 5 years of age is now Protected, and 75.8% of the population aged 5 to 14. k'Phtheria Immunisations, 1948.

The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and on submission to bacteriological and chemical examinations have proved satisfactory. Drainage and Sewerage. All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are connected to the sewerage system which discharges, by an arrangement with the L.C.C. into the London sewers. Stormwater is filtered and emptied into the Thames. Public Cleansing. The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1948 was 16,437 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 1,289 tons. A total weight of 15,297 tons was destroyed by the destructor and 4,748 tons was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 2,319 tons of Salvage was sold. Rodent Control. Work of rat and mice disinfestation is so maintained with the co-operation of owners and occupiers of premises within the Borough that there has been no complaint of serious infestation. In addition to the application of various methods of baiting, trapping, etc., on the surface, treatment of sewers has reduced the rat population, while the sealing off of old drains damaged by enemy action has prevented the easy passage of rats from sewer to surface or vice versa. 27 Complaints as to the presence of rats in dwelling houses were all investigated and generally, property or areas contiguous to premises, referred to have all been examined for signs of infestation, and complete treatment carried out where Necessary. Many business premises also continue to receive frequent attention of the Council's Rodent Operatives whose is largely by way of precautionary measures, in addition to the work of destruction of vermin. The work at business premises is carried out with the good will and co-operation of the occupiers who have met the Council charges for the work in all cases. Investigation, ruction and maintenance have entailed a total of 2,312 Visits by the rodent operatives, 1,762 to business premises and 550 dwellings, in addition to inspections by the Sanitary InsPectors as needed elsewhere. Inspection of Factories. There are 688 premises within the borough in connection with which the Sanitary Inspectors make inspection from time to time to ascertain, that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and the Sanitary Accommodation Regulations are Complied with. etc. addition -to this routine work, hygiene of canteens, has received attention, and advice a-s to the fitness of for human consumption given as necessary. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. following table includes the tabular statement by the Chief Sanitary Sanitary Inspector under article 27 (18) of the Sanitary Officers (Outside London) Regulations, 1935. Tabuated Statement of Inspections and Details of Work carried out by Sanitary Inspectors.

Two premises comprising four underground rooms were closed in accordance with Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, it being considered impossible to carry out work to make the rooms comply with the Council's regulations as to underground rooms. Details of Work carried out. The continued need for maintenance of every possible dwelling house, flat or tenement in a tenantable state of repair has led to the adoption of procedure in accordance with Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936, in every case of complaint in respect of a dwelling. Where perhaps a single sanitary defect has been complained of, all repairs necessary to bring the house up to the standard of Ministry of Health Manual on Unfit Houses have been required of the Owners in every case, and it may be said that owners generally have been co-operative. During the year, 94 Housing Act Notices were passed to the Town Clerk in default of the owners, whose final interest may be indicated by the fact lhat while all Notices were complied with, approximately 75% were completed by the owners' builders before the Borough Engineer found it necessary to instruct the Council's Contractors to proceed with the work in default. 29 The following table indicates the extensive and varied nature of the defects and dilapidations which have been made good following inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors. Sanitary dustbins provided 150 Yards paved or yard paving required 40 Insanitary forecourts remedied 5 Defective drains repaired or reconstructed 140 Defective soil pipes and ventilating shafts, repaired or renewed 9 Defective fresh air inlets repaired or renewed 33 Defective gullies removed and replaced by new 19 Rainwater down pipes disconnected from drain 2 Wishing and curb gullies repaired and new gratings fixed 32 Defective W.C. pans and traps removed and replaced by new 111 Defective W.C. flushing apparatus repaired or new fixed 90 Infective W.C. seats repaired or new fixed 51 Defective flush pipe connections repaired 38 Insanitary sinks removed or new fixed 48 Sink waste pipes repaired or trapped 62 Insanitary wall surface over sinks remedied 58 Ventilated food cupboards provided 20 Drinking water cisterns cleansed 15 Defective covers to drinking water cisterns repaired or new fixed 8 Insanitary sites beneath floors concreted 10 Paces beneath floors ventilated 35 Dampness in walls from defective damp proof course remedied 302 Dampness from defective roof, rainwater gutterings, etc., remedied 2182 Defective plastering repaired (number of rooms) 1749 Rooms where dirty walls and ceilings have been cleansed and redecorated 1959 Defective floors repaired 381 Defective or dangerous stairs repaired 95 Defective doors and windows repaired 1884 Defective kitchen ranges and firegrates repaired 479 Defective washing coppers repaired 17 Coal cup boards provided or repaired 11 Accumulation of offensive matter removed 7 rains unstopped and cleansed 18 30 Drains tested, exposed for examination, etc. 289 Smoke observations taken 29 Smoke nuisances abated on service of notice — Miscellaneous nuisances abated 122 Notifications of waste of water sent to Metropolitan Water Board 110 New W.C. apartments 3 Rent Restrictions Act.

There was a further reduction in the amount of food condemned in the Borough on account of unfitness for human consumption. This material was disposed of in accordance 31 with arrangements come to with the Ministry of Food (Salvage Division). It included 16,734 containers, i.e. tins, jars, packets—of fish, fruit, meat, vegetables, etc. The continued need for the conservation of all meat products necessitates the special attention of the Sanitary Inspectors to inferior meat and meat products—fresh or canned, which are sent into the Borough by the Ministry of Food for special treatment locally, the policy being to save the utmost food consistent with the retention only of sound food material. Though the great majority of unsound food is dealt with as material voluntarily surrendered by the owners, there were 35 complaints during the year of food sold in a condition which rendered it unfit for human consumption. In every case the food factory or warehouse or shop premises involved, when situated within the Borough, was inspected and the methods of production, transport and storage observed. Where the sale or production originated outside the Borough, appropriate communications were established. In one case, that of the sale of soya flour contaminated with mice droppings, the vendors were prosecuted and fines were imposed by the local Magistrates, and costs awarded to the Council. Milk. The pasteurising plant at 100 Bollo Lane has continued processing to full capacity by the High Temperature Short Time method with an absence of failure in Meth. Blue or Phosphatase tests. The empty bottles taken from the bottle filling lines were examined, and in all but two cases, were found to be sterile. In the cases of failure, steps were immediately taken to check up the conditions under which bottle cleansing was effected, and repetition of sampling indicated that the cause of the trouble had been located and dealt with effectively. Indeed these results reflect the high efficiency of the bottle washing plant and operation at the premises. This Dairy and the other eleven such premises subject to frequent inspection have been maintained in a hygienic condition, and there has been no complaint as to premises or products. Of 149 samples of milk taken during the year, only 5 and 3 respectively failed in the Meth. Blue and Phosphatase tests. 32 Water. Samples of water numbering 31 taken from various sources in the Borough were submitted to bacteriological examination, and all results indicated satisfactory supply. Ice Cream. In the course of the year the number of Ice-Cream manufacturers processing completely in accordance with the IceCream (Heat Treatment) Regulations was increased to eight. Three persons signified their intention to continue as manufacturers but by the adoption of the " cold mix" process. However, sampling has revealed that pasteurising, homogenizing and expeditious cooling by the use of an approved cooler, coupled with clean conditions in the factory, both as regards premises, apparatus and personnel are the sure way to the production of a bacteria free Ice-Cream. The total number of samples of Ice-Cream taken throughout the year was 32. Restrictions on dealing in Old Clothes. Under Section 154 of the Public Health Act, 1936, it is an offence for a person to distribute articles to persons under the age of 14 years in exchange for old clothes, etc. In the course of the year one person was observed to be engaging in this unlawful practice by distributing books and toys to children under the age of 14 years in exchange for old clothes. He was prosecuted and fined, costs being awarded to the Council by the local Magistrates. Rag Flock Act. The two samples of rag flock taken away proved to be unsatisfactory—due to improper storage conditions at the factory, and the occupier of the factory, being advised as to the proper method of storage of the material, improvement was effected accordingly. Diseases of Animals. The Borough remained free from Notifiable Diseases of Animals throughout the year, with the exception of Fowl Pest. 33 At two premises chickens were proved to be affected, and prescribed precautions being taken there was no spread of the disease. Slaughterhouses. The Slaughterhouses in Atlas Road and Hanbury Road have been in commission throughout the year, and the carcase and offal of every animal slaughtered have been examined as their fitness for human, food. The demand for horseflesh for human food is sustained, there being a further increase in the number of horses slaughtered during the year as compared with 1947. The incidence of Tuberculosis in Pigs is a little higher than in previous years as will be noted from the figures below. No case of Tuberculosis in Horses was noted during the year. total number of all carcases inspected during 1948. with details of surrenders on account of disease. Pigs. Horses.

SCHOOL AND M. & C. W. DENTAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1948. In common with other areas we have found the introduction the National Health Service to have an tedly adverse affect on the School Dental Services. Apart from the increased difficulty of obtaining suitable Dental Officers (we were again reduced to one in November) those few patients who in the past have said they would obtain treatment by private dentists, cannot get appointments without a long wait, if at all—even for emergency 42 treatment. This, however, does not prevent their expecting immediate treatment at the Clinic, and most of these are the ones who have used "Private Treatment" merely as an excuse for having no treatment at all. The acceptance rate for the School Children was 87%, for Mothers 74% and Infants 87%. The above percentages show refusals of 13%, 26% and 13% respectively, but these include, and in fact are chiefly made up of those who accept treatment on their consent forms and then fail to keep the appointments given them. As at least two appointments are given to each, the acceptance rate in terms of appointments which have to be provided for all these groups is over 95%. 104 cases were referred to the orthodontic clinic during the year and 31 to the Specialist Dental Officer.

A total of 43 children have received treatment during the year of which :— 6 were discharged, cured. 3 were discharged, improved. . 1 was discharged temporarily. 1 left school. 1 left the district. 4 failed attendance. Of the remaining 27 who require a further period of treatment: — 8 are making very good progress. 15 are making satisfactory progress. Since December 1st, time has been allocated by Middlesex i County Council for school visiting. The amount of time devoted to this work in Acton is, and will be, two sessions in every three weeks. E.
