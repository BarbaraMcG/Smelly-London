PLON 8 Presented 21 st May, 1903. SAMUEL, Mayor. A Common Council holden in the Chamber of the Guildhall of the City of London, on Thursday, the 21st day of May, 1903. THE Port of London Sanitary Committee did this day deliver into this Court a Report in writing under their hands, of their proceedings, and submitting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health to the 31st December, 1902; also recommending that the Committee be authorised to appoint Dr. James S. Warrack as Boarding Medical Officer at Gravesend to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. J. Grant Warren, at the salary of Five Guineas a week, and that he be placed on the Corporation Officers' Pension Fund No. 2 from the date of his permanent appointment; which was read. And a Motion being made and Question put, That this Court doth agree with the Committee in their said Report, the same was resolved in the Affirmative, and it is referred back to the Committee to carry the same into execution. Ordered, That the Report be printed, and a copy sent to every Member of this Court. BELL. To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled. WE, whose names are hereunto subscribed, of your Port of London Sanitary Committee, to whom it has been referred to carry into execution the powers assigned to the Corporation as the Port of London Sanitary Authority by the Local Government Board, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, beg to submit for the information of your Honourable Court the Annual Report of Dr. Herbert Williams, the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London for the year ending the 31st December, 1902, which Report contains a full and detailed account of the work done in the Port during that period by the Medical Officers and Inspectors. The Medical Officer refers at some length in his Report to the question of the medical inspection of Emigrants on outward bound vessels. This matter received considerable attention on the part of your Committee during the past year, and representations were made to the Board of Trade urging that passengers should be medically examined before embarking, in 4 order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases on outward bound ships, but the Board did not see their way to entertain the suggestion. By the authority of your Committee, the Medical Officer of Health of the Port gave evidence before the Royal Commission on Alien Immigration, and information as to the evidence submitted by him will be found in the Report. The Report of the Medical Officer also contains much interesting information respecting, amongst other matters:— Cholera and Plague, The destruction of Rats, and Canal Boats. During the year a large number of complaints as to Smoke Nuisances on the River have been reported to your Committee. Considerable difficulty has been experienced in dealing with this matter, but in all cases where the evidence has been considered sufficient to secure a conviction, proceedings have been instituted. As regards the Medical Staff, we have to report that Mr. J. Grant Warren, one of the Boarding Medical. Officers at Gravesend, having resigned his appointment, we have recently appointed Dr. James S. Warrack in his place. Dr. Warrack has satisfactorily passed the medical examination required by the Standing Order, and has taken up the Freedom of the City, and, as he also holds the Diploma of Public Health, he is eligible for permanent appointment on the Staff. We accordingly recommend that, following the course sanctioned by your Honourable Court in the case of the other Boarding Medical Officers at Gravesend, we be authorised to appoint him on the Staff at the salary of Five Guineas a week, and that he be placed on the Corporation Officers' Pension Fund (No. 2) from the date of his entering upon his duties, viz., 14th April last. Dr. E. V. Legge has been appointed Boarding Medical Officer at Sheerness, in the place of Mr. Monds Fox, whose resignation we reported last year, and the medical inspection of vessels entering the River Medway is being carried out by him in a satisfactory manner. The additional Block at the Hospital, the erection of which was authorised by your Honourable Court, was completed in October last, and formally opened by our then Chairman. In accordance with the Order of your Honourable Court, an Account of Receipts and Expenditure in connection with the Port of London Sanitary work for the year ended the 31st December last is appended (see Appendix). All which we submit to the judgment of this Honourable Court. Dated this seventh day of May, 1903. D. George Collins. Geo. Taylor. J. Cloudsley. Geo. J. Woodman. W. H. Williamson. Edward Ardley. N.

Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my first Annual Report, for the year ending 31st December last. It will be noted that the year's work on the whole shows an increase in nearly all directions over preceding years. This has been summai-ised in Table A, showing the figures for the year 1902 and for each of the five years preceding. During the year 33,606 visits of inspection have been made to vessels of all classes. Of these, 14,245 were in the River, 19,090 in the Docks and Gravesend district, and 271 were visited in that portion of the Med way which is within the jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authority. (Appendix A.) Of the total number, 2,934, equal to 8"73 per cent,., required cleaning, which was done under the verbal orders of your Inspectors. Of the vessels inspected, 16,336 were from Foreign ports and 17,270 were " Coastwise." The British vessels numbered 28,122, or 83.68 per cent., Swedish and Norwegian 2,026, or 6.02 per cent., closely followed by the German with 1,165, or 3.46 per cent. The nationalities of the vessels inspected will be found in Appendix C. Thirty-nine seamen, found by your Inspectors on their visits, suffering from various ailments of a non-infectious character, were referred to the Seamen's Hospital. In relation to the abatement of nuisances, structural alterations were ordered on a total number of 551 vessels. In the case of 350 vessels these have been carried out. In 36 cases structural alterations ordered in the preceding year have been carried out during 1902, bringing the total number of vessels on which alterations have been made up to 386. This number includes 119 alterations with respect to ventilation, 22 related to receptacles for the storage of drinking water, and 318 to lighting, heating, &c., the total number of alterations made being 459. (See Appendix F.) It is worthy of notice that these structural alterations have been carried out by the owners, after receiving written intimation of the facts from your Medical Officer, in all cases without recourse to legal proceedings. 6 Table A.

This will be instructive, as showing the extensive field of operations covered by your Officers. The Port of London, extending as it does from Teddington Lock to a line drawn from Havengore Creek in Essex to Warden Point in Kent, traverses five Counties (including the administrative County of London) and eighty-one Parishes. It covers a distance on the River of about 76 miles, and includes besides, 22 creeks with a total navigable mileage of about 45 miles. Of this about 31 miles are visited daily, giving a distance covered by the launches out and home of about 62.4 miles. The portions which are omitted from daily visits, but which are visited periodically, are from London Bridge to Teddington, Lower Hope to outer limits of the Port, and the Nore to Coalmouth Creek in the Medway. The Docks are situated at intervals from London Bridge to Galleons Reach, a distance of about ten miles, and at Tilbury. These docks have a total water area of 631 acres, or nearly one square mile, with a total length of quayage of 25.73 statute miles. It will thus be seen that the 7 total mileage to be covered by your Inspectors in launches and on foot amounts to about 90.13 miles daily, exclusive of the distance from dock to dock, &c. Notwithstanding the distance to be covered, the annual number of inspections shows a steady increase, and in 1902 exceeds the number recorded in any previous year since the Authority was constituted. POPULATION OF THE PORT. The Census of 1901 affords an opportunity of placing before your Worshipful Committee some information on the subject of the probable floating population of the Port, that is, the resident population as distinct from the daily working population, which is, of course, much larger. According to the Census returns, the number of persons enumerated on board seagoing and coasting vessels, and on inland barges and boats in the Counties of London, Middlesex, Surrey, Essex and Kent (see Table B) was 12,445 on 1,926 vessels. Of these, 9,166 persons on 1,299 vessels, or 73.65 per cent, of the total number, were within the jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authority. Of the population of the Port, 5,852 were on board British vessels, 1,633 on Foreign and Colonial vessels, 368 on inland barges and boats, and 1,313 on floating institutions not classified as " vessels." The total number of females on board vessels in the Counties mentioned was 689, or 5.53 per cent. The figures for the Port do not include any persons resident in houses situated in the Docks within the district of the Port Sanitary Authority. Allowing for these, it may, I think, be taken that there is a nightly population in round figures of about 10,000 persons within the jurisdiction of the Authority. The number will, of course, be governed by the number of vessels in the Port at any one time. This does not vary greatly on the whole, and, therefore, the figures would be fairly constant. The fact of this population is of interest, emphasising as it does the importance of the principal duties of your Officers in relation to Infectious Disease and the abatement of nuisances. In 1874, soon after the Authority was first constituted, your then Medical Officer, Dr. Leach—on an average annual number of 25,000 vessels entered —estimated the average number of vessels in Port at 1,000, and the population at 9,000. The average annual number of entries has now advanced to upwards of 28,000, and the number of vessels in the Port, with the population, approximates very nearly to the estimate of thirty years ago. A great change has come over the nature of the shipping since then. Sailing vessels have given place to steamers. These latter, although not employing more hands, i.e., in the ordinary cargo steamer, have much increased in carrying capacity and speed, consequently countries where infectious diseases are prevalent have been brought much nearer in point of time to this country, so increasing the danger from imported infectious disease. 8 TABLE B.

Ships, not being within the jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authority, have been excluded from this Table. 12 ALIEN IMMIGRATION. Owing, probably, to the sitting of the Royal Commission on Alien Immigration, and the consequent fear that restrictions would be placed upon the landing of aliens in this country, large numbers of such immigrants came during the year from Libau, in Russia. Upon enquiry it was found that the custom of the forwarding agents in Russia was to purchase or hire a certain amount of cubic space in the ship. In this space they would pack as many people as they could sell tickets to, irrespective of age or sex. The vessels were inspected on arrival, and the following facts were reported to your Committee:— "The class of immigrants to which I refer are those brought to this country from "Russia at a low rate, and they are herded together—men, women and children— " in a space which is not limited by any regard for health or decency. It is, of " course, a fact that the standard of comfort with these people is much lower than " obtains even amongst the lowest in this country. Therefore, it can be readily " understood that in the small space which is allowed to these people on board ship, " the conditions referred to are aggravated to a degree which can be better imagined "than described. There is no separation of sexes, the whole of the immigrants " occupying the one space by day, and at night sleeping on a common bench or " shelf, which occupies one portion of the space. The temporary closets provided " on deck are used indiscriminately by all, and in the case of the vessels which I " mention below the foulness arising from the condition of the people and their " surroundings was made worse by the drainage of urine, &c., from the horses " which occupied adjoining parts of the hold. (1) On the 14th May the s.s. "'Riberhuus,' of Esbjerg, from Libau, arrived at Gravesend with 133 Russian "immigrants, made up of 91 adults and 42 children. The vessel left Libau on the " 11th May. The immigrants were carried in the upper after 'tween decks, except " seven, who were berthed in the saloon. This space had a total cubic capacity of "7,621 feet, which provided 72'6 cubic feet per head. The total floor space was "433 square feet, which allowed 4*12 square feet per head. The only ventilation " provided was by four side ports, which were, of course, closed, by the after hatch" way, and by way of the bunkers. Access to these quarters was afforded by the " bunker hatchway on each side. The space was lighted by deck lights. The vessel " carried 272 horses. Fifty of these were carried immediately below the immigrants' " quarters, and the emanations from the animals and ordure had free access to the " quarters by means of the hatchways. Ninety horses were carried in the upper " 'tween decks forward of the space occupied by the immigrants, and liquid, con" sisting principally of urine drainage from these animals, was allowed to run down "the intermediate lobbies into the immigrants' quarters. (2) On the 21st May "the s.s. 'Hengest,' of Aarhuus, from Libau, arrived at Gravesend with 171 "Russian immigrants. The vessel left Libau on the 17th May. The immigrants " were carried in the after main 'tween decks in a space with a total capacity of " 7,172.9 cubic feet, giving 50.16 cubic feet per head only. The total floor space " measured 393.3 square feet, an area of 2.3 square feet only per head being " available. 1 would here call attention to the fact that the cubic space and floor " space in the case of this vessel was even less than that provided in the case of the "s.s. 'Riberhuus,' previously mentioned. The quarters occupied by the immigrants 13 " were in a filthy condition, the floors being strewn with all kinds of refuse, and " offensive liquid from the horses carried on the same deck had leaked through into " these quarters. No attempt had been made at cleansing this space since the vessel " had left Libau. Two temporary closets were provided, and both were used " indiscriminately by the sexes. The only ventilation provided was by means of the " bunker hatchway, and by two 1'2-inch ventilators, one of which was without a "cowl, and closed. The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, provides that steerage "emigrants carried on the lower deck shall have not less than 18 clear superficial "feet of deck space, and that if the height 'tween decks is less than 7 feet, or if the " apertures for admitting light and air, exclusive of side scuttles, are less in size " than in the proportion of 3 square feet to every 100 square feet of deck for each " steerage adult emigrant, each such emigrant shall be entitled to 25 square feet; "that all unmarried male steerage emigrants of 14 years or upwards shall be " berthed in a compartment divided off from the space occupied by other steerage " passengers ; and further, that not more than one steerage passenger, except " married couples, females, or children, shall at any time occupy the same berth ; "that with regard to privies separate provision shall be made for (a) males, " (b) females and children, and that all privies and w.c.'s shall be firmly constructed, "and maintained in a cleanly and serviceable condition throughout the voyage. " The master of the vessel is liable for infringements of these provisions to penalties "varying from £20 to £500. With reference to horses, the Act provides that none " shall be carried below any deck on which emigrants are carried, nor in auy " adjoining compartment unless separated by watertight bulkheads, and in vessels "of less than 500 tons not more than two head of large cattle shall be carried, and "in larger vessels one head of large cattle for every additional 200 tons. That the " number of steerage passengers shall not exceed the proportion of 15 to every " 100 tons registered tonnage. The registered tonnage of the ' Riberhuus' and "'Hengest' is 340 and 145 respectively, so that had they been British vessels they "could only have carried 51 and 62 immigrants. I am of opinion that the limita" tions laid down by this Act express a minimum incapable of reduction without "prejudice to health. I think it might be reasonably urged that limitation of a "similar kind should be enforced on foreign vessels carrying immigrants, and, if " your Committee approves, I would suggest that this be brought to the notice of "the Board of Trade and the Russian and Danish Governments. With regard to " the nuisance which undoubtedly has existed, and still exists, in every case of "arrival of these immigrants, and for which the masters of the vessels, and the " owners, by whose default clearly the nuisance arises, are liable, I wish to suggest "to your Worshipful Committee the advisability, as soon as vessels in a similar " condition to those mentioned enters the Port of London, of serving a statutory "nuisance notice on the master while within the jurisdiction of your authority, not " only to abate the existing nuisance, but to prevent its recurrence. Then upon auy " subsequent arrival of the vessel, should a recurrence of the nuisance be found, "legal proceedings might be taken for non-compliance with the notice." Your Committee made representations to the Consuls for Denmark and Russia, and a question was asked in the House of Commons, from which it appears that the Board of Trade has no power to interfere. A copy of your Medical Officer's Report was thereupon sent to the Royal Commission, with the result that your Medical Officer was invited to give evidence, which he accordingly did. His evidence covered the greater part of two days, and was represented by answers to a series of 393 questions. 14 Your Medical Officer described the administration by the Corporation as the Port Sanitary Authority, of its powers under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in relation to nuisances and infectious diseases, and the regulations of the Local Government Board relating to Cholera, Yellow Fever and Plague. A description was given of the methods adopted in carrying out their duties, by the Medical Staff of Boarding Officers stationed at Gravesend. It was brought out in evidence that, except in the case of infectious disease, or under the regulations of the Local Government Board relating to Cholera, Yellow Fever and Plague, your Medical Officer had no power to order vessels to stop for the purpose of inspection. As a matter of actual practice, vessels were ordinarily boarded while still under way. Reference was also made to the arrangements in the early nineties, when Cholera existed on the Continent, and in those ports from which Jewish immigrants were arriving. At that time Masters of vessels bringing alien immigrants furnished the Medical Officer of Health with a list of such aliens and the addresses to which they were going on landing. This arrangement, so far as it enabled the Port Sanitary Authority and the Local Sanitary Authorities ashore to follow up such aliens, in view of possible cases of Cholera, was only partially successful, owing to the absence of complete control by the Sanitary Authorities. It was pointed out that, although the Port Sanitary Authority possessed no power under the Public Health Act to compel a vessel to stop, yet a power of entry existed under the Public Health Act if there were reason to suspect a nuisance on board. Your Medical Officer described the conditions he had personally found on boarding vessels bringing alien immigrants, such conditions being practically those previously described in this Report, and the filthy condition in which at that time many Aliens arrived. Allusion was made to Section 10 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which says that the Sanitary Authority shall have the right " to enter from " time to time any premises (a) for the purpose of examining as to the existence " of a nuisance thereon," and it was shown that a nuisance under Section 2 might be defined as " a house or part of a house, so overcrowded as to be injurious or " dangerous to the health of the inmates, or, is not kept in a clean state or free "from effluvium from any drain, privy, or earth closets." Section 110 states that " any vessel lying in any river or other water within district of a Sanitary " Authority shall (subject to the provisions with respect to the Port Sanitary " Authority of the Port of London) be subject to the jurisdiction of that " Authority, as if it were a house within such district," and it was asked whether the words " lying in any water" applied to a ship passing by. It was pointed out that, on this point, some uncertainty arose, and that the power of the Port Sanitary Authority in dealing with the undoubted nuisance which existed on vessels carrying aliens was considerably weakened by the uncertainty attaching to the terms of this section, because, as soon as the 15 vessel reached her berth and became clearly " lying" in the Port, the passengers were all landed, and the nuisance, so far as overcrowding was concerned, ceased to exist. That since the matter had been brought by the Port Sanitary Authority to the notice of the representatives of the countries from which the aliens arrived, there had been a marked improvement, both in the condition of the people and the accommodation provided for them on the vessel. It was suggested that it would be an advantage if the Port Sanitary Authority had power to detain vessels bringing aliens of the particular class in question at Gravesend until such time as they could be inspected by the Medical Officer, and that no real hardship would accrue, either to the ship, shipowners, or owners of the cargo in case of such detention. That the Medical Officer should further have the power to act without reference to the Sanitary Authority, as, for instance, in the case of exotic diseases. Subsequently one of the Metropolitan stipendiary magistrates in giving his evidence commented upon that previously given by your Medical Officer, stating that the difficulties to be contended with as set forth by your Medical Officer were not overrated. That a ship moving on the river could not be termed a " house " within the meaning of the Public Health Act until it was " lying," i.e., anchored or moored and attached to the soil, but that a vessel moving might be considered as " premises." There was no practical difficulty with regard to going on board, because no master of a vessel would prevent it, especially as the boarding was usually done in company with the Customs House Officer. There was, however, a great difficulty in dealing with a nuisance existing on a ship. With regard to these immigrant ships, the difficulty might perhaps be circumvented. It might, for instance, be argued that the River Thames, from Gravesend to the Docks, should be considered premises. It is property vested in the Conservancy, and the definition of " premises " in the Public Health Act is very far-reaching, including '' messuages, buildings, lands, easements, and " hereditaments of any tenure, open or closed, built on or not, public or private, " and whether maintained or not under Statutory Authority." That a ship, as described by your Medical Officer, with numbers of persons living there, might be described as a nuisance existing on " premises," namely, "the Thames." The fact remained, however, there was no power to stop a ship. Further, there was the question of insufficiency of time for the purpose of communication with the Port Sanitary Authority. In relation to this, there was a case which had not perhaps been sufficiently realised. " The London County Council versus Hobbis " * laid down that a public authority might delegate a matter of this nature to an Officer. * 75 " Law Times," page 687. 16 It was suggested that if the Port Sanitary Authority took legal advice on this point a way might be found out of the difficulty, and that your Medical Officer should apply for authority to take proceedings in these cases, the Port Sanitary Authority having power to grant the authority asked for. It was further suggested that Section 110 of the Act might be amended by substituting for the word " lying" the word " being.'' Such amendment would confer the necessary power of entry. It was possible, of course, for your Medical Officer to act as a private individual in the matter of a nuisance, but probably such a course would do little good. Undesirable immigrants might be defined as aliens whose domicile in England is, or is likely to be, detrimental to the community, on the ground of (1) bad character, (2) physical and mental disease, (3) dirty or offensive habits, (4) no probability of being able to live permanently in proper conditions of health or decency without the assistance of public charity or relief. To be an undesirable immigrant should be a summary offence. That the conditions of alien immigrants in respect of these definitions should be decided on board the ship in which they arrive. It was suggested in reference to proceedings under the nuisance clauses of the Public Health Act that Sanitary Authorities appear to go for cure rather than prevention, with the result that the process had been described as " endless." It was absolutely necessary, if the law was to be enforced, that it should be looked upon as punitive where persons are in fault, and penalties should be inflicted. Section 4, Sub-Section 4, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, provided a penalty of 10/. in every case where a Notice had been served on a person under the section, and either (a) the nuisance arose from the wilful act or default of the person, or (b) such person makes default in complying with the requirements of the Notice within the time specified. There were very few cases where a fine of 10/. would not be a sufficient punishment as a deterrent. Of course, in the case of a defendant not paying, in default of distress he would go to prison. Should the Royal Commission decide to impose restrictions on the importation of aliens into the Port of London, especially as regards personal cleanliness and freedom from disease, I would point out that this Authority has all the machinery for dealing with this aspect of the question. It would only be necessary to give powers to detain such vessels at Gravesend for inspection by the Medical Officer of your Authority, and the subsequent detention on board the vessel of any persons found unfit until it has been decided whether to allow them to land or to return them whence they came. The inspection of such immigrants by the Board of Trade Officer as to their financial condition, destination, &c., could take place at the same time, and the opportunity of detaining the vessels there would ensure this being done in a thorough manner. 17 MEDICAL INSPECTION. Medical inspection (see Appendix B), both at Gravesend and Sheerness, continues to be satisfactory. I would remind your Committee that this medical inspection is carried out in conjunction with the Officers of H.M. Customs. It is true that the presence of your Medical Officer relieves the Customs Officers of much responsibility which they should not be expected to bear, but as the transport is provided by H.M. Customs, much expense thereby is saved to the Corporation. I desire to recognise the extreme courtesy and ready assistance which I have always received from J. C. Elliott, Esq., the Inspector of Waterguard, H.M. Customs, Gravesend, as, indeed, from all officers of that body with which I have come in contact. At Gravesend the number of vessels medically inspected was 1,668, which is above the mean for the five preceding years (see Table A). This is owing to the larger number of ports treated as infected. The vessels medically inspected carried passengers to the number of 2,385, and crews 64,443. At Sheerness the number of vessels for the year was 244 (exclusive of Flushing-Queenboro' mail boats). The vessels carried 115 passengers. Handbills relating to the mooring of infected vessels below Gravesend, and to signals by vessels approaching Sheerness, have been circulated during the year, as follows :— THAMES CONSERVANCY. NOTICE TO PERSONS IN CHARGE OF VESSELS. Notice is Hereby Given that vessels required by the Port of London Sanitary Authority to be disinfected are to lie at the lower buoy in Gravesend Reach, and Masters and Pilots are requested to moor quarantine vessels accordingly.

To MASTERS OF VESSELS, PILOTS, and other Persons whom it may concern. RIVER MEDWAY. NOTICE. By the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, it is required that a Vessel from foreign ports, on entering any British Port, shall hoist the proper national colour. In default of compliance, the Master shall for every offence be liable to a fine not exceeding 100/. The Eastern Limit of the Port of London is represented by an imaginary line drawn from Havengore Creek in the County of Essex, to Warden Point in the Island of Sheppey in Kent, which line passes from two to three miles Eastward of the Nore Lightship. It is therefore required that the Masters of all Vessels from foreign ports, arriving in the Port of London, shall Hoist the National Colour Immediately on Entering within the Limits of the said Port, and maintain the said signal until visited by His Majesty's Customs, and pratique given. At night a white light should be exhibited over the Port bow. Masters of Vessels are reminded that they are required to report all cases of illness occurring on the vessel, or that have occurred whilst in the port of departure, and during the voyage of such vessel. If the above signals are shown when entering the Eastern Limit of the Port of London, as above defined, the Medical Officer of the Port of London Sanitary Authority will be in attendance with His Majesty's Customs at Sheerness and so avoid delay, and relieve Masters of Vessels from the responsibility of deciding whether any case of illness is infectious or not. BY ORDER. 19 On the 29th December, the Local Government Board issued an Order amending their Order of the 9th November, 1896, with reference to the exhibition of night signals by vessels infected with Cholera, Yellow Fever, or Plague. The following is a copy of the Order, with its accompanying Circular :— Circular. Regulations as to Cholera, Yellow Fever, and Plague. (NIGHT SIGNALS.) Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., Sir, 29th December, 1902.

By Article 25 of the Regulations, provision was made for the hoisting and display by the Master of every ship infected with any of the diseases before referred to, when within three miles of the coast of England and Wales, of a certain signal during the whole of the time between sunrise and sunset. The Board, deeming it desirable to provide also for the display of a night signal by the Master of every ship infected as aforesaid, have now issued an Order amending the Regulations accordingly.

WALTER H. LONG, President. S. B. PROYIS, Secretary. Date of publication in the London Gazette, 26th December, 1902. 23 MEDICAL INSPECTION OF EMIGRANTS ON OUTWARD BOUND VESSELS. Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. In February last I had to call attention to the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, relating to the medical inspection of emigrants, and to the manner in which the Port Sanitary Authority is affected thereby. Section 306 of the Act provides:— 1. For the medical inspection of all steerage passengers and crew, when the services of a medical practitioner can be obtained. 2. That such inspection shall take place on board ship or on shore before embarkation. Section 307 provides :— 1. That if the emigration officer is satisfied that any person on board or about to proceed is, by reason of sickness, unfit, or for that or other reason in a condition likeyl to endanger the health or safety of the other persons on board, the emigration officers shall (a) prohibit the embarkation of any person, or (b) shall require him to be re-landed after embarkation, and the master shall remove such person or persons. 2. That the master, owner, or charterer of the vessel be liable to a fine not exceeding 100L. for any non-compliance with this section. 3. That any person embarking after contravention of this section may be summarily removed and be liable to a fine not exceeding 40s. for each day on board after prohibition. 4. That upon re-landing under this section the master shall pay to each steerage passenger so re-landed, or if he be lodged and maintained on any hulk or establishment under the superintendence of the Board of Trade, then to the emigration officers at the port, subsistence money at the rate of one shilling and sixpence per day until (a) he has been re-embarked, (b) declines or neglects to proceed, or (c) until his passage money has been returned. This question came before your Committee in the years 1883-1884, when these cases were landed at Gravesend, and the town authorities naturally objected to cases of infectious disease being allowed to roam about within their iurisdiction. Some correspondence ensued, and the result was that the Board 24 of Trade Medical Officer was instructed to land these cases at the hospital ship "Rhin," belonging to the Port of London Sanitary Authority at that time. The medical inspection still continues, and on many occasions cases of infectious disease have been discovered and handed over to the Port Sanitary Authority. The common practice of the Medical Officer of the Board of Trade is to board the tender on arrival alongside the ship at Gravesend, and to examine every person as they pass up the gangway. There seems no reason why this should not be done on the pontoon at Tilbury before the emigrants pass on to the tender. Although it is true that in the case of infectious disease several persons may have been exposed to risk of infection whilst travelling in the train, yet when such person goes on board the tender and mixes with the other passengers, the risk becomes general. The difficulty of re-landing will be got over if such examination be done on the pontoon or in the dock. On February 14th last, the s.s. "Orizaba," being outward bound to Australia, the Medical Officer of the Board of Trade found, whilst examining the passengers on the tender, that a child was suffering from Chicken-pox. He placed the father and mother and two children in a boat and sent them to the hulk " Hygeia'' with their baggage. There is no difficulty in dealing with a case of infectious disease, but a difficulty arises in connection with the friends. In this instance the people had paid their passage-money, had come from Leicestershire, and they suddenly found themselves stranded. The question of dealing with them was thrown upon your Officers. The father alleged he was without means, and unable to make provision for staying until his child recovered, and the vessel had sailed. From motives of humanity, therefore, I provided the family with shelter on the hulk, offering in the morning to take the child into hospital, and referred the father to the relieving officer of Gravesend. The father finally adopted a passive attitude, and the whole family with their baggage were landed at Gravesend. Ike points of the case are :— 1. The Board of Trade undertake this medical inspection in the interest of the steerage passengers. If a case of infectious disease is found they refuse to allow the case to proceed. If the patient be a child with its parents, it means, of course, that the parents will not sail without the child, and the instructions to the Board of Trade Medical Officer are that they shall land. 25 2. The detection and removal of cases of infectious disease are clearly in the interests of the shipowner, who would possibly, or even probably, if an outbreak of infectious disease occurred on board, be put to the expense of detention in quarantine at foreign ports. 3. The isolation and removal of cases of infectious disease and subsequent measures of disinfection are the duties of the Port Sanitary Authority in the interests of the public health. 4. If these people are landed at Gravesend or Tilbury they are thrown entirely upon their own resources, and should the child be suffering from a disease, which although infectious, as, for example, Whooping Cough, but which is not a dangerous infectious disorder within the meaning of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or should the Port Sanitary Hospital not have accommodation for such cases, or should it be thought not advisable to take the patients into the Hospital, the onus of dealing with the friends of the patient is thrown upon the Local Authority, a responsibility they are likely to object to. Inasmuch as Section 307 (4) implies that in some cases such persons may be landed, and if lodged and maintained in any hulk or establishment under the superintendence of the Board of Trade, shall receive from the master of the ship subsistence money, it would appear that the Act contemplates that the Board of Trade should make some provisions for dealing with such persons. Much correspondence on the question passed between your Worshipful Committee and the Board of Trade. Your Worshipful Committee pointed out that the medical inspection of emigrants by the Board of Trade took place either on board the vessel or in the tender which conveyed them from the shore, and that should a case of infectious disease be discovered then, it was more than probable that many persons on board had been exposed to the risk of infection. It was therefore suggested that the medical inspection should take place on shore and before the emigrants had been aggregated either on the tender or vessel, and moreover pointed out that this could be done on the pontoon at Tilbury. The Board of Trade apparently not recognising that the reason for the medical inspection was to prevent outbreaks of infectious disease on board after the vessel had sailed, declined to entertain the suggestion. 26 Table D.

During the year Cholera has been prevalent in several Eastern countries, notably in Egypt, where thousands of cases have occurred, including many in Cairo and Alexandria. Nearly 2,000 towns and villages throughout Egypt have been affected. Vessels arriving from Egyptian ports particularly, have accordingly been closely watched with a view to the detection of any case of this disease. In all, twenty cases have been reported on vessels arriving during the year, but no case has been found on any vessel arriving in the Port. On the 7th June, the s.s. " Statesman," of Liverpool, arrived at Gravesend, having left Calcutta on the 4th May. A native cook was attacked on the 8th with Cholera, and died the following day. The body was buried at sea, after being seen by a doctor at Suez, who certified that the cause of death was Cholera. The vessel was thoroughly disinfected at Suez, together with all bedding and effects, which were treated on shore. On arrival at Gravesend it was ascertained that no further cases had occurred, and as all were found well on board, the vessel was allowed to proceed to dock. On the 4th July, the s.s. " Machaon," of Liverpool, from Yokohama, arrived at Gravesend, and reported that 17 Chinese had died of Cholera during the voyage. One case occurred on the 14th May, two on the 15th, four on the 16th, two on the 17th, one on the 18th, two on the 19th, one on the 21st, two on the 22nd, two on the 23rd. Seven were buried at Singapore and ten at sea. The vessel, together with all bedding and effects, was thoroughly disinfected at Singapore, all effects belonging to the deceased being destroyed. On arrival at Gravesend, all being well on board, no further action was deemed necessary, and the vessel accordingly proceeded to dock. She was kept under daily observation during her stay, but no further sickness, even of a suspicious nature, occurred. On the 27th November, the s.s. "Norwood," of West Hartlepool, from Alexandria, arrived at Gravesend, and reported having landed one of the crew at Alexandria suffering from Cholera. This was the only case that had occurred on board, and on medical inspection by your Medical Officer, all on board were found well. The holds, cabins and forecastle, with all effects, had been thoroughly disinfected at Alexandria, and no further action was therefore necessary. YELLOW FEVER. No case of Yellow Fever has been reported during the year. 28 PLAGUE A total of ten cases, affecting seven vessels, has been reported and dealt with. Of these, one actual and three suspected cases were removed to, and treated at, the Port Sanitary Hospital. Many vessels arrive from Plague-infected ports having persons on board suffering from slight fever with buboes, for which no apparent cause can be found. In these cases it is the usual practice to land them at Denton, and detain them in hospital for observation and bacterioscopic examination of the contents of the buboes by Dr. Klein, F.R.S. A case of special interest is that of the s.s. " City of Perth," of Glasgow, from Calcutta. The vessel left Calcutta on the 2nd May last with a crew of 15 Englishmen, 44 Lascars and one English passenger, and a cargo of seed and jute in bags and bales, bound for Dunkirk in France. The vessel touched at Colombo on the 10th, Suez on the 26th, Port Said on the 27th, and Malta on the 31st, all well on board, and received free pratique at those ports. On the 1st .June, the chief steward, an Englishman, complained to the master of a smell in his store room. It appears that on this date he cleaned out his store room, and found several dead rats, which he threw overboard. On the following day he complained of a smell in the sail room immediately above the store room. This was cleared out by a " tindal," when 30 dead rats were found and thrown overboard by him. On the 6th, the steward complained of feeling ill, and was found to have high fever and, subsequently, a swelling in the left groin. On the 7th, the " tindal " who cleared out the sail room was also taken ill with similar symptoms. The master suspected the nature of the disease, and isolated the men. The vessel reached Dunkirk on the 10th June, where a French pilot was taken on board, to whom the master reported that he had two sick men, and urgently wanted medical advice. The pilot took the vessel right into dock, in spite of the statement of the master, arriving in dock at 2 p.m. A message was sent to the Port Medical Officer, who, it would appear, was out of town, and the vessel remained in statu quo until 6 p.m., when he came on board the vessel and pronounced the disease to be Plague. The French Authorities refused to allow the sick to be landed, but permitted a French doctor to go on board, and he seems to have done all that was possible under the circumstances. The two men died the next morning, and were landed at Dunkirk for burial. The vessel was ordered out of the Port into the Roads, and all communication with the shore was forbidden. The master was informed that he must take his ship to St. Nazaire, where there was a lazaretto, for the discharge and disinfection of the cargo, and that when that was done the vessel might return to Dunkirk. The alternative 29 was that the vessel should go to an English port. While a decision was being arrived at, the vessel remained at Dunkirk Roads until the 17th, when it was decided to bring the vessel to London. On the 13th, a native saloon waiter was taken ill with symptoms similar to the previous cases. The patient was isolated, and Yersin serum injected by the medical man on board. Later in the day the pain subsided, and the patient subsequently became delirious, but the next day his condition on the whole somewhat improved, until the morning of the 18th, when the vessel arrived in the Port of London. At this time he was much worse, being in a cold, collapsed, and practically pulseless condition. It was, however, decided to remove him to the Port Sanitary Hospital, and your Medical Officer personally supervised all arrangements. After the administration of warm drinks and stimulating medicines he became better, talking sensibly, and there seemed every prospect of his recovering. In the course of the night he became worse, and died suddenly in the morning. Material was furnished to Dr. Klein for bacteriological examination, and he reported that morphologically and physiologically the disease was Plague. The post-mortem examination was made by Dr. Willoughby, and it was found that the appearances of the lungs were those due to broncho-pneumonia. With regard to the vessel, on her arrival on the morning of the 18th, the master was directed to anchor in the lower part of Gravesend Reach. Your Medical Officer was waiting there, and boarded the vessel. All persons on board were examined by him, and one passenger, a French doctor, and French pilot, were allowed to land, after personal disinfection and having their clothes passed through the steam disinfector. Their addresses were notified, together with that of the English pilot, to the Medical Officers of Health of the district to which they were going ; those of the French persons being communicated to the French Consul in London. No communication, otherwise than by your Officers, was allowed with the shore. The next morning, at daybreak, the effects of all persons on board, and all bedding, linen, &c., were landed at Denton Hospital, and there disinfected by steam. The vessel was washed down with a strong solution of corrosive sublimate. This process occupied the whole of the day, being finished late in the evening. On the 20th, the owners were allowed to commence fumigation of the holds and cargo with sulphur dioxide, both with a view to the destruction of rats and as well as an additional precaution in the way of disinfection. There was a strong probability that the cases of Plague on this vessel were due to infection by rats, and your Medical Officer decided that the vessel should not 30 be allowed to come higher up the River until all the rats on board had, as far as possible, been destroyed, collected, and burned. To do this, it was necessary that the cargo should be transhipped. This was done while the vessel was lying in the lower part of the River. The men employed at the work were clothed in over-alls, which were properly disinfected after use, and on leaving their places of destination were notified to the Medical Officer of Health of their district. The result of the fumigation was that about 200 dead rats were found. The handling of the carcasses was not permitted. Each dead rat was picked up with tongs, immersed in a solution of corrosive sublimate, and burned in the ship's furnace. The holds, when empty, were washed down by a powerful hose with disinfecting fluid. On the 5th July, one of the natives was found to be suffering with symptoms of Pneumonia. Bearing in mind that this is one of the forms in which Plague attacks the human being, the man was immediately landed at the Port Sanitary Hospital, and material sent to the Local Government Board for bacteriological examination. The reports received were, however, absolutely negative as regards Plague ; the patient went through the ordinary phases of Pneumonia, and recovered. No further cases occurred. The vessel left the Port of London on the 9th July, for Glasgow, the Medical Officer of Health for that Port being duly notified of the vessel's departure. It is worthy of special notice that the s.s. " City of Perth " was bound for Dunkirk with a cargo for France. By the action of the French Authorities, and the owners, the vessel was sent into the Thames, thereby causing a serious menace to the health of this country, and placing a grave responsibility upon the Port Sanitary Authority with much labour, which should rightly have been borne by the French Authorities. At Dunkirk there appears to be no means of dealing with such an emergency, and the persons on board were cooped up with the sick and dying, and exposed to all the horrors of the ancient quarantine system, in opposition to the terms of the Venice Convention. These facts were represented to the Local Government Board and to the Foreign Office. On the 26th June, the s.s. " Yeoman," of Liverpool, arrived at Gravesend, from Calcutta. The Master, in answer to the usual questions, stated that all were well on board, and that there had been no sickness during the voyage. He further signed a form stating that no Plague, or case of suspected Plague, had occurred during the voyage. It was found, however, that there had been a case of suspected Plague landed from the vessel on the 11th June, at Suez, and that the vessel had been detained 24 hours for disinfection. Under these 31 circumstances the master was summoned for breach of the Local Government Board Regulations, and convicted. The fine and costs amounted to 71. (See Appendix L.) On the 22nd November, the s.s. " Arabia," of Greenock, arrived at Gravesend, from Bombay. A Lascar was found with feverish symptoms and a bubo. He was removed to Denton Hospital for observation, a case of Plague having been landed at Bombay before the vessel sailed for England. Bacteriological examination, however, failed to demonstrate the existence of Plague in this case. DESTRUCTION OF RATS. The precautions adopted with a view to minimise the risk of the introduction of Plague by means of rats have been rigidly enforced, and the capture and destruction of the vermin have been kept under close observation and control by your Officers for nearly two years past. Up to the 31st December last, a grand total of nearly 186,000 rats, has been accounted for and destroyed. (See Appendix T.) The whole of this work has been carried out by the Dock Companies and Shipowners in their own interests, and without involving any expense to the Port Sanitary Authority. I use the expression " in their own interests," for it cannot be too strongly impressed on shipowners that should cases of Plague occur in London, or even rats be found in the Docks suffering from Plague, Continental countries would at once impose quarantine on ships sailing from the Port of London, entailing much interference with trade and financial loss to the owners of vessels. SMALL-POX. The total number of cases reported during the year was 93, of which number 29 were admitted and treated in the Port Sanitary Hospital. (Table D.) The epidemic which was existing in London at the end of 1901 continued during the early part of 1902, finally dying out in the second quarter of tue year. It was very prevalent in Poplar, Bermondsey, and other riverside districts, and naturally several cases were met with which had been contracted during brier visits on shore. 32 The following cases occurring during the year are of interest:— On the 20th March, a report was received from the Seamen's Hospital that two cases of Small-pox had been admitted from the s.s. " Ituna," of London, from Newcastle-on-Tyne. The cases were removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital, together with the bedding and effects on the vessel, and the vessel disinfected. Yaccination was offered to the crew, but accepted by only two persons. This vessel was trading between the Tyne and London. On March 6th, during a fog, she anchored for the night in close proximity to the Small-pox Floating Hospital in Long Reach. The rash in each case began to appear on the 20th, and this will agree with the fact that a period of fourteen days usually elapses between the time of exposure to the infection and the appearance of the rash. The s.s. "Opal" arrived at Gravesend, March 20th, from Valencia. The Master reported one man ailing with diarrhoea, due to the eating of oranges. The case was investigated by your Medical Officer, and was found to be an obvious case of Small-pox. The Master rightly absolved himself of responsibility by reporting the case of illness, although his diagnosis was erroneous. The vessel was disinfected, and vaccination offered to the crew. On the 24th March, the s.s. " New Pelton " was lying off Erith. At this time some seamen were noticed in the town of Erith whose appearance created suspicions, and they were traced to this vessel, and found by the Medical Officer of Health for Erith to be suffering from Small-pox. No communication was made to your Medical Officer, but the men were at once removed by the local authorities at Erith to hospital. In so doing, they were acting ultra vires, inasmuch as the cases were not within the Erith Urban District, and could easily have been removed to the Hospital of this Authority. The Urban District Council would thereby have avoided the expenses of maintenance of the patients in the Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, which they subsequently had to pay. On the 13th April, the attention of Dr. Willoughby, the Medical Officer on duty, was called to a body found in the River in the vicinity of the hulk " Hygeia," and he found ample evidence that the body was that of a man who had been suffering from Small-pox. The body was subsequently identified as that of a patient who had escaped from the Ward of one of the Small-pox ships of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, on the 20th March, and had jumped into the River. The s.s. " Arno " arrived from Libau on 17th July, and was boarded at Gravesend by the Medical Officer on duty. 33 The Master reported that there was no illness on board, and the vessel not having come from an infected port was allowed to proceed to Mill wall Dock, and arrived there the same day, and the passengers went on shore. There were 352 in all, 265 going to America, vid Liverpool, and 87 remaining in London. On the following day one of the immigrants proceeded to the London Hospital, where he was found to be suffering from Small-pox, and was thereupon removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The medical man who saw the case at the London Hospital stated that the rash must have been out on the patient twenty-four hours before arrival of the vessel. The vessel was disinfected, and through the kindness of Mr. Hawkey, an examining officer of H.M. Customs, who collects from alien immigrants certain information for the Board of Trade, I was enabled to obtain the names and addresses of nearly all the people remaining in London, and the Medical Officers of Health of the Boroughs concerned Avere duly notified. Although such a large number of passengers w^re on board, no surgeon was carried, and it will be easily realised how one undetected case of infectious disease on such a vessel might lead to the wide dissemination of such a disease. The Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, as well as the owners of the line of steamers by which these passengers contemplated crossing to America, were notified of the facts. On July 16th, a man employed at the Hospital, Denton, in connection with the building of the new Ward, complained to the Medical Officer of not feeling well ; he was carefully examined, and was found to be in the early stage of a very mild attack of Small-pox. He was forthwith placed in the Small-pox Ward. On July 3rd, a patient died in the Hospital from Small-pox, and the aforesaid man being a relative of the caretaker, assisted the latter to remove the body to the Mortuary, and there is little doubt that the disease was contracted on that occasion. The steam tug " Sunshine " plies on the River Thames, and members of the crew go ashore at various places. The engineer ailed on July 10th, and not feeling better decided to go home on Sunday, July 13th. He travelled by train to Gravesend, and his attention was drawn by a boy in the railway carriage to spots on his face and wrists. On arriving at his home, Gravesend, he was seen by a doctor, and the complaint was diagnosed as Small-pox. This is an example of how this disease is disseminated in the early stages. 34 The fact was communicated to the Medical Officer of Health for Gravesend, but no further precautions could be taken beyond the disinfecting of the tug and vaccination of the crew. Yaccination was offered to all on board the tug, the owner, in a publicspirited manner, offering not only to pay their private doctor for doing this, but also to pay the wages of any man off duty from this cause. In spite of this the men refused to be vaccinated. On the 13th July, the s.s. " Historian," of Liverpool, from Calcutta, having on board four passengers and a crew of 134 hands, comprising Europeans and Asiatics, arrived in the Port of London. One of the members of the Asiatic crew was found to be suffering from Small-pox. The disease was in a late stage, but the man had been released from isolation the day before, and allowed to mingle with the remainder of the crew. Inasmuch as he was in an infectious state, it was necessary to remove him to the Port Sanitary Hospital, and to disinfect all the natives' effects, which was done by landing them at the Port Sanitary Hospital and treating them with superheated steam. The s.s. "Grange" arrived from Grangemouth on the 21st July. One of the crew had remained at home at Cupar-Fife, feeling unwell, and on the 21st July, after the arrival of the vessel in London, a telegram was received from the Medical Officer of Health, Cupar-Fife, stating that the man had developed Small-pox. The vessel was immediately disinfected, and all infected articles on board removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital for disinfection by steam. The s.s. "Aurora" arrived from Oran, North Africa, on the 25th July, and was boarded at Gravesend by the Medical Officer on duty. The second engineer was found to be suffering from Small-pox, and was removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital, together with the third engineer, they having both occupied the same cabin, with all infected bedding and effects. The members of the crew were mustered and examined, and vaccination was offered to all, nine accepting. Disinfection of the vessel was duly carried out by your Officers. On the 30th August, the s.s. " Kronos, " of W. Hartlepool, arrived from Sunderland, and proceeded to the Poplar Dock. The same day one of the crew was admitted to the Seamen's Hospital, and found to be suffering from Smallpox. After disinfection the vessel returned to Sunderland, the facts being communicated by me to the Medical Officer of Health at that Port. 35 On October 29th, information was received that three cases of Small-pox had been removed to the Shelter of the Metropolitan Asylums Board ; it was stated that the persons had come from Dunkirk. Enquiry was made on all vessels from Dunkirk, but without result. It was subsequently ascertained that the people had not come by way of the Port of London. They were members of a travelling show, touring on the Continent, and returning to their homes in this country. They travelled from Dunkirk to Calais, crossing over to Dover, and thence by train to Charing Cross, three persons being removed to hospital suffering from Small-pox the same day that they arrived at their destination. There would appear no doubt that the persons referred to were in a condition to disseminate the disease during the whole period of the journey from Dunkirk to Hammersmith, and it is a further example of the manner in which this disease may be spread broadcast, and how persons unwittingly may be exposed to the risk of infection. The absence of Small-pox on the training ships throughout the epidemic is remarkable, more especially in the case of those on the Essex shore near the villages of Purfleet and Grays, where Small-pox has been very prevalent. This, in my opinion, is entirely due to the thorough, and, where necessary, repeated, vaccination of the inmates of these vessels. This is specially interesting, as it has been stated that the epidemic in Purfleet was largely due to aerial convection of the disease from the hospital ships of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. If this were so, then the training ships being in the direct path of such aerial convection, would have been equal sufferers with the villages had they not been protected by vaccination. I am pleased to report that no member of the Staff during the past year has contracted Small-pox, although during the epidemic constantly exposed to risk of infection. It is needless to say that every member of the Staff is vaccinated on entering the service, and re-vaccinated when required. Chicken-pox has been a notifiable disease during practically the whole year. The following handbills were circulated throughout the Port and amongst Medical Practitioners during February and October :— COMPULSORY NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. CHICKEN-POX. CORPORATION OF LONDON. "VfOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN, that as a matter of emergency in JLl consequence of the spread of SMALL-POX in this country, the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of the City of London, as the Port 36 Sanitary Authority of the Port of London, do hereby, by virtue of the power vested in them by Section 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, order that as from the 7th March, 1902, the provisions of the said Act with respect to Infectious Diseases shall apply in the district of the said Port Sanitary Authority to the Disease known as CHICKEN-POX, in addition to the Diseases specifically mentioned in Section 55 of the said Act or any Order extending or amending the same, and that such Order shall remain in force until the 30th June next.

Notifications should be addressed to— The Medical Officer of Health, Telegrams— "MEDOFF, LONDON." port of london, Telephone— 44' King William Street, 36 DEPTFORD. Greenwich, S.E. 37 The compulsory notification of Chicken-pox has for its object the detection and removal to hospital of mild cases of Small-pox, which might otherwise be diagnosed and treated as Chicken-pox. ENTERIC FEYER. There has been a slight diminution in the number of cases of Enteric Fever dealt with as compared with previous years. As will be seen by the comparative Table D, Enteric Fever commonly outnumbers any other disease dealt with. During the past year, however, it has been exceeded by the number of cases of Small-pox. In the group of years given Enteric Fever reached its maximum during the year 1900, when many cases were brought from South Africa, and the diminished number of cases is partly explained by the fact that no vessels have arrived from the Argentine Republic with live cattle, owing to the Board of Agriculture not allowing cattle from that country to be landed in Great Britain. Vessels carrying live cattle require to carry a large quantity of fresh water for the use of the cattle, and it is the usual practice to fill all the ballast tanks direct from the River Plate. Judging from the condition of this water as seen on vessels on their arrival from Argentina, that river must be in a very polluted condition, and it is the custom of the foremen and cattle attendants to drink the water when thirsty, rather than take the trouble to get other, and proper, drinking water, which is kept in a place apart for the use of persons on board. It is only to be expected, therefore, that many cases of Enteric Fever occur on such vessels, and as the importation of live cattle from Argentina will be resumed early in 1903, your Officers will have probably to deal with an increased number of cases of this disease. SCARLET FEVER AND DIPHTHERIA. The cases of these diseases reported have occurred principally on training ships (see "Training Ships," page 39), but otherwise present no features of special interest. Only two cases of each disease were admitted into the Port Sanitary Hospital. 38 MEASLES. Thirty-six cases were notified, and 11 treated in the Port Sanitary Hospital. HOSPITAL. During the year the following cases were treated in the Hospital :— Bubonic Plague 1 0 1 Suspected ditto 3 3 0 Small-pox - - 29 27 2 Enteric Fever - 27 28 y 0 Scarlet Fever - 2 2 0 Diphtheria - 2 2 0 Other Diseases - - - - 24 23 1 Totals - 88 85 9 — Patients remaining in Hospital, 1st January, 1903—1. Total number of days'treatment during the year was - 1,755 1 Average number of days' treatment for each case - - 18'47 The average daily cost of maintenance per head was - 2s. 1*35d. A new Block has been erected in the grounds of Denton Hospital, consisting of two Wards, containing four and eight beds respectively, with two sleeping rooms for nurses. The Block will be quite complete, so that in the event of any infectious disease, the nurses will live there in charge of the place and patients. The new arrangements for discharging patients have now been completed. These consist of three rooms, communicating. In the first the patient undresses, and leaves the infected clothing ; in the second a disinfecting bath is taken, and clean clothes put on ; in the third he remains until he leaves the Hospital. This latter room also serves as a waiting room for the friends of patients. When the war in South Africa was drawing to a close, owing to the existence of Plague there, the War Office Authorities were apprehensive that this disease might be brought home by returning soldiers. They approached 39 the Port Sanitary Authority with a view to obtaining the reception of any such cases into their hospital, and a contact camp was established at Tilbury, and an arrangement was made with the War Office Authorities for the reception of any cases of Plague occurring in the camp. The disinfecting apparatus has done good service during the year, and has been recently examined, and found in good order. TRAINING SHIPS. The health of the boys on the training ships has been good. No serious epidemic has to be recorded. There have been a few cases of Diphtheria on the training ship " Warspite." This vessel, it will be within the recollection of your Worshipful Committee, was removed from Charlton to Greenhithe, owing to repeated occurrences of this disease on board. The cases recorded this year have been very mild in character, and might not have attracted attention but for the vigilance of the Medical Officer to the ship. Owing to his prompt action in isolating the patients in the ship's hospital on shore, the disease has been kept in hand. Taking into consideration the number of boys on board, and also the persistence of the infection, even for months after the patient has apparently quite recovered, I have conferred with the Medical Officer, Dr. Lambert, and suggested that any boy proved bacteriologically to have Diphtheria shall not return to the ship. The following cases of Infectious Disease have been reported during the year :— Name of Vessel. Smallpox. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. Scarlet Fever. Measles. Erysipelas. Chickenpox. Total. "Arethusa" ... 3 2 3 ... ... ... 8 "Cornwall" ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... " Exmouth " ... ... ... ... ... ... .. ...

I append a chart showing the movement of the imports of frozen mutton and lamb from the Colonies and Argentine Republic during ten years to the 31st December, 1902, in terms of the number of carcasses brought into this Port for each of the years mentioned. From this it will be seen that the total imports of frozen mutton and lamb is practically the same in 1902 as for the preceding year. On referring to the chart showing the imports from each country, it will be noticed, however, that the imports from Australia suffered a remarkable deficiency, being approximately about one half that of the preceding year, and falling to the level of ten years ago. This deficiency from Australia was, however, compensated for by the increased imports from New Zealand and from the River Plate. With reference to the Argentine Republic, it will, of course, be remembered that the importation of live cattle and sheep from that Republic was entirely prohibited during the year 1902. The popular impression was that this prohibition would affect the supply of meat to this country. It is interesting, therefore, and important, from a public health point of view, to note that this result was not achieved. From a Report issued by Messrs. W. Weddell and Co., it appears that the prohibition of live cattle and sheep from South America may be said to have had no effect on the quantity of meat imported, inasmuch as the increased exports from the Argentine Republic in the form of frozen meat more than equalled the food equivalent of live cattle and sheep formerly imported into this country from Argentina. Moreover, the prices at which frozen or chilled meat can be sold in this country are much lower than when it arrives in the shape of live animals. The bearing of this upon the public health will be noticed in reference to my remarks on Enteric Fever, where it is shown that the decrease in the number of cases of this dangerous infectious disease introduced into this country during the past year was to an extent owing to the withdrawal of the tramp cattle steamers from the trade of the Port, so that the temporary prohibition of live cattle not only protected the country from cattle disease, but from infectious diseases dangerous to the community, and this without diminishing the quantity of meat imported or increasing the price. The total imports of meat from the Argentine Republic during 1902 were 113,812 tons, as against 102,172 tons in 1901, a difference of 10'22 per cent. The deficiency in the Australian imports was, of course, due to the severe drought, and further to a large demand for frozen meat in South Africa. There was at the same time a considerable increase in the amount of meat received from the Continent of Europe, the total imports being 29,149 tons, as against 20,738 tons in 1901. The number of seizures of Unsound Food amounted to 447 (see Appendix J). The number is somewhat less than the preceding year (Table PORT OF LONDON Meat Imports (Mutton 3 Lamb) from the Co/on/es and the the rgentine Repubh e For Each Country. Accrecate. 41 A), but at the same time it comprises some large quantities, notably on 19th April, 1,000 tons of sundry unsound food stuffs, salvage goods, at the West India Dock ; on the 26th April, 3,500 cocoanuts at the London Dock ; 17th June, 1,181 carcasses and sundry pieces of mutton, ex s.s. "Langton Grange" ; 4th July, 54 tons of dates at the Millwall Dock; 25th July, 17,643 carcasses of mutton and lamb, ex s.s. "Rangatira"; 6th September, 18,399 carcasses, 32,381 pieces of mutton, and 2,229 quarters of beef, ex s.s. "Niwaru." I take the opportunity here of calling attention to the difficulty of dealing with enormous quantities of unsound meat. It is, of course, impossible to convey before a Magistrate a huge quantity, such, for instance, as that dealt with on the " Niwaru " ; on the other hand, it is equally impossible to see the whole of the bad meat in the ship at once, although there is good reason for believing that the visible portion represents but a small part of the whole amount which is bad. It is, further, quite out of the question to discharge a large quantity of bad meat and store it for the purpose of being viewed by a Magistrate, as by the time the last of the meat has been discharged, the condition of the first portion would be past description, and a serious nuisance would exist. To this must be added the fact that the whole cost of dealing with it would fall upon the Port Sanitary Authority. There would be considerable loss of time, and the Port Sanitary Authority would have to abate the nuisance which would inevitably arise. Under these circumstances the sections of the Public Health Act dealing with unsound food are found to be unworkable, and reliance has to be placed upon those sections which deal with a nuisance existing or likely to arise. Fortunately there is in most cases a great probability of a serious nuisance arising from a discharge of a large cargo of unsound meat, and in the case of the s.s. "Niwaru " the persons interested in the cargo concurred in the view of your Medical Officer as to the likelihood of a nuisance, and the shipowners sent the ship to sea, where the bad meat was discharged in the North Sea at a distance from land under the superintendence of Inspector Spadaccini. The following is a short summary of articles seized during the year :— Meat—Fresh and Frozen :— Beef 2,292 quarters, 108 sundry pieces and packages Mutton and Lamb 38,373 carcasses, 33,368 sundry pieces Veal, Pork and Offal 110 cases, 17^ cwt, sundry pieces Preserved :— Tinned - 369 cases and 516 tins Smoked and Salted - 41 packages, 2 tons, and 34 pieces Rabbits— Frozen 27 crates Tinned - 2,987 tins 42 Poultry and Game :— Frozen 3 packages, 3 cwt. and 310 loose sundry Fish :—Wet 2 packages and 4 cwt. sundry Preserved—Tinned 124 cases, 2,339 tins and 5 cwt. ,, Dried 3 packages Fruit—Fresh 3,641 packages Preserved—Dried 2,340 packages and 9f tons in bulk „ Tinned, Bottled / 1,215 cases, &c., 5,686 tins and bottles and 176 tons 1 cwt. in bulk Vegetables—Fresh 1,312 bags and boxes and 37½ tons in bulk Preserved—Dried 128 bales, boxes, &c.

Details will be found in Appendix J. 43 SANITARY INSPECTION. In Table E is shown a comparison for the eight years ending 31st December, 1901, between the total number of vessels entered in the Port of London, Foreign and Coastwise, steam and sail, as published in the Annual Statement of Navigation and Shipping issued by the Board of Trade, and the annual total number of inspections of vessels by your Inspectors since the year 1895. I have prepared this Table, inasmuch as it has been stated that " Coastwise " vessels arriving in the Port of London do not receive a proper amount of inspection. Though much remains to be done in the way of sanitary details for the improvement of this class of vessel, it will be clear, on a perusal of the Table, that since comparative figures have been recorded, all vessels arriving " Coastwise " are accounted for in the inspections. Previous to the year 1898 practically all sailing craft from below Gravesend were entered at the Custom House as " Coastwise " arrivals. This had the result of considerably inflating the annual number of " Coastwise " arrivals, the fact being, that a large proportion of such entries were " inland navigation " and not bond fide " Coastwise" traders. This was realised by His Majesty's Customs, with the result that this class was further defined as shown by the note appended to the Table. As affecting the return of " Coastwise " vessels by your Officers, the result is remarkable. Whereas, previously to the year 1898, the proportion of inspections to entries did not appear to be more than about one-third, since the amendment of the definition of " Coastwise " traders, the number of inspections exceeds the number of entries in a substantial degree. The excess of inspections over entries being due, of course, to the inclusion of barges as " Coastwise " by your Inspectors, and to the fact that the same vessels would in many instances be visited by more than one Inspector, as the vessel moved from one part of the Port to another. I am of opinion that the figures show the inspection of " Coastwise" vessels to be satisfactorily carried out as regards numbers, although, as I have stated, there is still a considerable amount of work to be done in the direction of sanitation as applied to this class of vessel. In this connection I would refer you to the special Report made by me on " Canal Boats," included in this Annual Report. Table A shows that the total number of vessels inspected by your Officers during 1902 is a substantial advance upon the mean for the preceding five years. The total number of nuisances reported and dealt with, including those involving structural alterations, also shows an increase. The average annual number of the preceding five years (see Table A) was 707'8. During 1902 the total was 1,187. The average annual number of Notices issued during the five years was 52'8. The number of Notices issued during 1902 was 285. The total number of nuisances abated, including structural alterations, is also above the mean of the five previous years. In twelve cases only were legal proceedings necessary in order to enforce compliance with the requirements of the Authority. (See Appendix S.) 44 Table E. PORT OF LONDON.

Consequently, in the above Table, vessels engaged in trading between places in the Estuary of the River Thames, within the limits mentioned above, have been excluded, as coastwise traders, subsequent to the 31st December, 1897. * Previous to the year 1896 the record of Inspections was not separated as to " Foreign" and " Coastwise " arrivals. | At the time of sending this Report to press, the Official Return of Foreign and Coastwise Vessels entering the Port of London during the year 1902 had not been issued. 45 NUISANCES. During the year 1,187 nuisances have been reported and dealt with. (See Table A.) Nuisances fall practically into one of three classes, viz., those affecting sanitary conditions in general, and those relating specially to (a) smoke, and (b) to the sanitary conditions found on barges carrying cargoes of foul and offensive matter. I have therefore grouped them accordingly, and a full list will be found in Appendices L to P. Of general nuisances, some of the most important are as follows:— Some five years since, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, on the outbreak of Plague in India, erected some quarters on shore in the Royal Albert Dock, for the accommodation and isolation of native crews from their vessels. The erection of these quarters was sanctioned by your Committee on the understanding that they were to be used only as temporary accommodation for crews during the disinfection of vessels. The Company, however, thought fit to utilise them as more or less permanent shore quarters for the natives, with the result that their sanitary condition became seriously defective. They were overcrowded, a feature unfortunately rather common in the accommodation provided for natives. In this case, the maximum cubic space available for each native found occupying was only 69 feet, with about 8 superficial feet of gross floor area, which actually diminished to 3.63 feet clear of obstructions. The Company were therefore called upon to reduce the number of bunks, and re-arrange them so that there should be at least 150 cubic feet available for each native, and 7'26 square feet of floor space per head, and this was done. Another important alteration made was with regard to the "Louisa Ashburton" Coffee Rooms, in the Royal Albert Dock. This place affords food and refreshment to a large class of dock employees; consequently a large amount of cooking takes place in the kitchen. This kitchen was found to be in a filthy condition, badly drained and structurally defective. A careful inspection was made, and a detailed list of requirements compiled and placed before the owners, with the result that the place was entirely renovated and put in good order. Important improvements with regard to sanitary conveniences and ventilation have also been effected at several large bottling stores in the Poplar Dock, where numbers of workpeople of both sexes are employed. The conveniences, 46 especially for the female employees, were found deficient and defective, both as regards equipment and proper arrangements for flushing and cleansing. Further, they were not in every case sufficiently isolated from the places where bottling of beer and washing of bottles took place. I have to report that in every case these defects have been made good. During May, the attention of the National Telephone Company was called to the condition of their private call offices in the Royal Albert Dock. The Company at once realised their responsibilities and the places were cleansed, and arrangements made for this to be repeated at regular intervals. SMOKE NUISANCES. During 1902, 325 complaints have been reported and dealt with. The Port Sanitary Committee have directed the service of 114 Notices upon the persons in default, and legal proceedings have been taken in five cases. It will thus be seen that the question has had considerable attention at the hands of the Committee. The result is that an improvement has been brought about, one line of steamers at least, using the Pool, have given up the use of coal and are using coke for their "donkey" boilers, whilst others have had fitted patent smoke-consuming apparatus. There are two sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which deal with the question of smoke nuisance, viz., 23 and 24. Section 23 was made specially applicable to the Port of London, but as a matter of experience it is both cumbersome and difficult to work. Section 24, which deals with a nuisance from black smoke in a summarv manner, is also not altogether satisfac- tory. A tug is observed to be offending, and the fact is reported to your Worshipful Committee, who, being satisfied of the existence of a nuisance, direct that a statutory Notice be served on the person by whose act, default, or sufferance the nuisance arises or continues. It is usual to serve this Notice on the owner, but a copy is also served upon the Master, and in future this will be done on the engineer also. Should the vessel be observed emitting black smoke in the course of the next six months following the service of the Notice, a conviction would probably be obtained were the aforesaid person summoned before a court of summary jurisdiction, but in the majority of instances the vessel, when seen, is not committing a nuisance, and as the Notice lapses at the expiration of six months, the whole business has to be done over again. 47 The chief cause of offence is owing to the donkey boiler in use on vessels being frequently too small to generate sufficient steam for the number of winches at work engaged in unloading the cargo. The practice is then for the furnace to be overstoked, and constantly being raked over, with the consequence that dense volumes of black smoke issue from the funnel. The Pumping Stations of the London and India Docks Company have been reported on several occasions, but smoke-consuming apparatus has been introduced in some instances with considerable success. The chimneys of factories, &c., situated on land are great offenders, and when boarding a tug, your Officers are frequently told to look at the chimneys on shore, especially those belonging to H.M. Arsenal at Woolwich, and it is true that many of these chimneys emit more black smoke in an hour than a tug could do in six. OFFENSIVE CARGO BARGES. Strong action has also been taken by the Committee in the matter of barges, used as dwellings, and used for the carriage of foul and offensive cargoes within the limits of the Port. As might perhaps have been expected, such action met with some show of resistance on the part of owners of these vessels, especially those represented by the Kent and Essex Brickmasters' and Flint Merchants' Association. Many of them were engaged under contracts for the removal of refuse matter from the wharves of the various Borough Councils, &c., and the Contractors took occasion to approach the Borough Councils and raise the price of their contracts as the result of the action of the Port of London Sanitary Committee. Subsequently some correspondence took place between the Town Clerk and the Clerks of the Borough Councils on the matter. Then the barge owners united and decided to fight a test case in Court. This was done, and they, through their legal representatives, agreed to carry out the requirements of the Port Sanitary Authority without reserve, and paid the costs of the proceedings. Subsequently, apparently desiring to qualify this action, a deputation of the owners sought an interview with the Port Sanitary Committee, and were, of course, told that the Committee has no option but to carry out their legal obligations. One hundred and twenty-three barges have been reported as defective, and Notices have been served upon the owners of each requiring such cleansing and structural alterations as will abate and prevent the recurrence of any nuisance. Twenty-six of these Notices are known to have been complied with during the year, and in four cases legal proceedings have been taken. 48 A difficulty in dealing with these barges, and also in dealing with cases of smoke nuisance, is this: that after the issue and service of a Notice by direction of the Authority, the vessel may not again be seen for some months, and the Notice lapses, when the whole procedure has to be commenced anew. Particulars of action take in respect of these barges will be found in Appendix 0. The number of infringements of the Bye-laws during the year was 14. In no case was legal proceedings necessary. WATER BARGES. These vessels are kept under regular periodical supervision, and the number now at work in the Port is 23. (Appendix K.) Their general condition is good. In six cases cleansing has been ordered by your Officers, and carried out. Two new barges have taken the places of old ones during the year. The use of iron instead of wood in the construction of these barges is now practically universal. CONDITION OF WATER- RIVER AND DOCKS. The condition of water in the River and Docks has been fairly satisfactory during the year. During the summer there was a nuisance owing to the state of the water in the Limehouse Lock and South Dock Lock of the West India Docks, and as this was due to the condition of the mud at the bottom, action with regard to the removal of the mud was deferred, and the addition of precipitants and deodorants minimised the nuisance. On the 29th July, your Committee ordered, on the recommendation of your Medical Officer, the service of a Notice upon the London and India Docks Company, requiring action to be taken in order to prevent recurrence of the nuisance, and the Dock Company have accordingly taken steps to remove the foul deposit at the bottom of these Locks. The comparatively inoffensive condition of the water in the River was no doubt largely attributable to the somewhat low atmospheric temperatures and the abundant rainfall experienced during the summer months. 49 STAFF. I append a list of the Officers at present forming the Staff of your Worshipful Committee, and take this opportunity of making the following comments With regard to the Medical Staff at Gravesend, the only change that has taken place has been the resignation of Mr. Warren, whose place has been temporarily filled. The medical inspection of vessels carried out by Dr. Legge at Sheerness since the 20th July last is very satisfactory, more especially the manner in which the duties have been performed, apart from the number of vessels inspected. With reference to the Office Staff, the duties of each have been performed satisfactorily, notwithstanding a material increase in the work resulting from the enlarged returns received from the Inspectors. The statistical matter and graphological charts accompanying the various sections of this Report, were specially prepared for the purpose by your Clerk, Mr. Albrow. The inspection of food has been well carried out by your present Staff of Food Inspectors, and I have to report that the following Inspectors have passed the Special Examinations of the Sanitary Institute for Inspectors of Food, and are therefore qualified to act, should occasion arise, as Food Inspectors:— Inspector W. G. Romeril. „ A. Garland. „ W. G. Wetjen. The work of sanitary inspection, as before mentioned, has resulted in increased numbers of coastwise vessels and canal boats being inspected. Special attention has been directed to barges with cargoes of foul and offensive matter, though there has been considerable difficulty experienced in satisfactorily following up these barges owing to their constant movements about the Port and their occasional temporary withdrawal from the trade. Hospital. The duties of Medical Officer are at present being performed by Mr. G. C. Hancock, assisted by a staff of three nurses, who continue to perform their respective duties in a thoroughly satisfactory manner. Launches. The launches continue to do excellent work, being responsible during the year for 12,409 visits of inspection, or 36.92 per cent. of the total number. 50 NAMES OF STAFF.

This is to some extent due to the increased vigilance necessary in the early and latter parts of the year in the search for possible cases of Small-pox. The total number of boats inspected was 894, which is 262.4 above the mean of the five preceding years. This number of boats was registered to carry 3,342 persons, but was occupied by 1,872 only. This is an average of 2.09 persons per boat. It has been suggested that the population of these boats would probably be found on a night visit to be in excess of the number declared to the inspector, by day. In relation to this, the returns of the last census are of interest, inasmuch as they show that on a total of 154 inland barges and boats lying within the Port of London, 368 persons were enumerated, or an average of 2'38 persons per boat. Taking the whole of the registration counties of Middlesex, Surrey, London, Essex, and Kent, on a total of 361 inland barges and boats, 870 persons were enumerated, which gives an average of 2.40 persons per boat. The proportion of females according to the same return is represented by a total of 188, or 21.60 per cent. of the total number of persons enumerated. On the canal boats inspected in the Port of London, the number of females carried was 15.27 per cent. of the total number of persons. Of the total number of boats inspected, 748 were found to conform with the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations. On the remaining 146 there were found infringements to the number of 221. In 138 cases, written complaints were sent to the owners, and of these 114 are known to have been remedied. The total number of infringements is 114.6 above the mean for the preceding five years, and comprises 22 infringements in regard to registration, 24 with regard to lettering, marking, and numbering, 33 with regard to cleanliness, 47 required some structural repair, 23 had no proper water vessel and 38 boats failed to produce a certificate when requested. There have not been any new boats registered, and I would point out in relation to this that the practice is growing in this Port, especially with the large trading "combines," of substituting dumb lighters for the resident barge. The dumb lighters are towed to their destination, and there is no longer any necessity for persons to sleep on board. Registration is therefore not required. 52 One boat was re-registered on account of structural alterations having been made, viz., the construction of sleeping accommodation for an additional hand; eleven were re-registered for other reasons, principally change of ownership. The total number of boats registered is below the mean for the preceding five years. Legal proceedings have not been taken, although in one instance such were ordered, on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health, viz., in the case of the "Mary Ann," of Towcester, No. 140. This boat is owned by the master, who makes his home on board. At one time his wife accompanied him, but it appears that since her decease the man has been accompanied by an adult daughter and two young children, all occupying the after cabin, which was not re-registered or fitted accordingly. The boat was first met with on the 14th January, 1902, and the master was cautioned. It was again seen on the 19th March, and found occupied as before. At their next Meeting the Port Sanitary Committee ordered that the master should be summoned for an offence under the Canal Boats Acts. Since that date, however, the boat has not been seen in London, and enquiries made with regard to the whereabouts and movements of the boat have been unsuccessful.* In another case, that of the "Nansen,'' Berkhampstead, No. 261, a lad over 14 years of age was found occupying the same cabin as his parents. The parents were warned, and the infringement remedied the next day by the lad sleeping in the fore cabin. The boat left this Port for Sonning Mills, Reading, and the Registration Authority there was advised, the result being that when the boat reached there it was found that the undertaking given by the parents had been adhered to. The lad subsequently left the boat. Three cases of overcrowding were met with, in all cases caused by children in excess of the number registered for. Warnings were given in each case. Two boats have been disinfected for infectious disease. On March 8th, it was reported that one of the crew of the steam canal boat "England," Port of London, No. 19, had been removed from his home at Erith to the hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board suffering from Small-pox. The boat was therefore found and disinfected. On October 22nd, the wife of the master of the canal boat "Providence," Berkhampstead, No. 282, complained of feeling unwell, with symptoms of a severe cold. On the 7th November she left the boat at Brentford, and was admitted to the Cottage Hospital there with supposed Influenza, which was *Since going to press it has been ascertained that this man was summoned at Coventry, in December, 1900, for precisely the same offence, and fined 20s. and 13s. Costs. 53 subsequently diagnosed as Enteric Fever, and the patient removed to the Ealing Hospital. This information having been forwarded from Brentford by telephone, the boat was found at Deptford Wharf, and thoroughly disinfected. In my last Report I called attention to a class of vessel, almost peculiar to the Port of London, known as sailing barges. The cabins of these vessels are in every case used as dwellings, women and children in many instances are carried, and the conditions which apply to canal boats, apply also with equal force to these vessels, and all others in a similar trade. These vessels ply within the estuary of the River Thames, and between places within the limits of the Ports of London, Rochester, Faversham and Colchester. They are for the most part registered under the Merchant Shipping Act as "British Ships," but little or no attempt is made to carry out the provisions of this Act with regard to the comfort and health of the crew, indeed it is questionable whether those provisions were ever intended to apply to other than bond fide "sea-going" vessels. Assuming, however, that they do apply, there is no Authority exercising powers under the Act, which possesses adequate machinery for enforcing them in respect of this numerous and mobile class of vessels. It would appear that the Board of Trade have no power to refuse registration to these vessels, even when their modest requirements as to cubic space, ventilation, heating, &c., are not complied with. They can only refuse to deduct the space occupied by the crew from the registered tonnage of the barge. The registration is effected as a nominal record, cancelled only when the vessel is totally lost, or has been transferred to a foreign flag. It does not imply that the accommodation provided for the crew is of a satisfactory character from a health point of view. At one time these vessels, when from places seaward of Gravesend, entered and cleared at the Custom House as "Coastwise" vessels, but since the year 1898 this has been discontinued, as the following extract from the Annual Statement of Navigation and Shipping will show:— "From the 1st April, 1898, trade between all places in the estuary of the "River Thames within the Ports of London, Rochester, Faversham and "Colchester, to the westward of an imaginary line drawn from Reculver " Towers to Colne Point, ceased to be considered trade by sea within the "meaning of Sec. 140 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and the "arrivals and departures of vessels engaged in such trade ceased to be " recorded as entrances and clearances in the Coasting Trade." The result of this definition is that about 85 per cent. (annually) of sailing vessels are no longer recorded as "Coastwise " traders. A small proportion of sailing barges has been registered with the Port of London Registration Authority under the Canal Boats Acts, but apparently a view exists that the vessels so registered are to some extent at a disadvantage compared with other barges which are free from the restraint of 54 control consequent on registration. Moreover, there appears to be in the minds of many owners, and especially masters, a sentimental objection to the term "Canal Boats," when applied to their vessels which ply to a large extent in salt water. There is, perhaps, some slight ground for this objection, as the vessels in question differ largely from "Canal Boats" as generally understood. As an obstacle to registration it is, however, occasionally raised, and registration under the Merchant Shipping Act substituted. To remove it, the substitution of some term such as "Inland Navigation" in place of "Canal Boat" would probably be sufficient. As before mentioned, when registered under the Merchant Shipping Act, the owners and occupiers enjoy greater latitude of behaviour inasmuch as the Port Sanitary Authority can only interfere in case of an actual or suspected nuisance, or in case of infectious disease, in the exercise of their powers under the Public Health Act. I would, however, strongly urge that many of the evils, social and physical, which the Canal Boats Acts were introduced to minimise and abolish on the canal systems of the Kingdom, obtain, though perhaps to a less extent, on these sailing barges. I have stated that both children and women are frequently carried. The former are usually below school age, or if not, are carried during their holidays. The barges are neither safe nor desirable places for the accommodation of the young of either sex. With regard to women, frequently the adult female found on board is the wife of the master or the mate. When this is so, she will often, as in the case of canal boats share the duties on board whether in the galley or at the helm. Her presence is known probably to the owner of the vessel, and no difficulty would be met with as regards registration to meet cases of this kind. On the other hand, the presence of females is not always of so regular a character. Complaints are occasionally made of gross disorderly proceedings on barges. There is as a rule no case for the police, and obviously none for the Sanitary Authority; but were these vessels compelled to be registered under the Canal Boats Acts, proceedings could at once be taken against the master and also the owner where the vessel was not properly fitted and registered for occupation by an adult female, being the wife of one of the male occupants of the same vessel. The Canal Boats Acts are stringent, necessarily and properly so, with regard to this class of offence, and with some modification to meet the important sanitary questions of effectually disconnecting cargo spaces from the cabin, lighting, warming, cleanliness, and ventilation, I am strongly of opinion, and would urge your Worshipful Committee to move, under Sec. 10, Canal Boats Act, 1884*, that in your opinion all vessels of whatever class or description which trade or ply ordinarily within the limits westward of an imaginary line drawn from Reculver Towers in the County of Kent to Colne Point in the County of Essex, should be registered as "Canal Boats," or for "Inland Navigation" only under the Canal Boats Acts or any Act or Acts amending 55 the same, with the Registration Authority appointed by Law for the Port or place to which they belong. I may add that were this done, the difficulty experienced in dealing with barges carrying offensive cargoes would be considerably diminished. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HERBERT WILLIAMS, M.D.Lond., D.P.H.Cantab. Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. * Canal Boats Act, 1884, Sec. 10:— "If it shall at any time appear to the Local Government Board, on the "representation of any registration or sanitary authority, or of any inspector "appointed under this Act, that the principal Act and this Act ought to apply "to any vessel or class of vessels which would be within the definition of "Canal Boat contained in Section 14 of the principal Act, if such vessel or "class of vessels were not registered under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, "and the Acts amending the same, the Local Government Board may declare "that the principal Act and this Act shall apply to such vessel or class of vessels, "although the same may be registered as aforesaid, and thereupon the same "shall be deemed to be a Canal Boat or Canal Boats within the meaning of "the principal Act, and this Act and the definition contained in Section 14 of "the principal Act shall be amended accordingly." Canal Boats Act, 1877, Sec. 14, states that:— "The expression "Canal" includes any river, inland navigation, lake, or "water, being within the body of a county, whether it is or not within the ebb " and flow of the tide." "The expression" Canal Boat" means any vessel, however propelled, which "is used for the conveyance of goods along a canal as above defined, and "which is not a ship duly registered under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, " and the Acts amending the same." 56 SUMMARY OF CANAL BOATS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST DECEMBER, 1902.
